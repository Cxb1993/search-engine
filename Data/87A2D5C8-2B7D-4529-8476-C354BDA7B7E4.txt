Abstract  
    Mass transfer in mass exchangers, such as membrane extractors and dialyzers, can be 
analogous to heat transfer in heat exchangers with correction-factor analysis. In present study, 
the expressions of mass-transfer rate and correction-factor charts for mass transfer in 
parallel-flow double-pass rectangular membrane modules were modified by the modified 
correction-factor analysis, instead of the conventional correction-factor analysis. They are 
explicit, instead of implicit in the conventional correction-factor analysis. The results can be 
readily calculated without using trial-and-error method. Experimental results confirm the 
predicted values for membrane extraction of acetic acid from aqueous solution by methyl 
isobutyl ketone, as well as for dialyzing from aqueous solution, in the double-pass devices.

2.1. Mass-transfer rate 
The mass-transfer rate in a rectangular membrane module with length L and width B may 
be expressed from the mass-transfer point of view as 
 
KBLW  (average concentration difference)           (1) 
 
where K denotes the overall mass-transfer coefficient, which may be estimated either by the 
correlation equations (Yeh and Chen, 2001b), or by the resistances-in-series expressions (Yeh 
and Huang, 1995) if the properties of fluids and membrane materials are all known. The 
averaged concentration differences between fluid a and fluid b are varied with the flow 
patterns and membrane systems. For convenience, we may take the logarithmic mean, 
 lmC , coupled with the correction factor F, analogous to heat-transfer in heat exchangers 
(Bowman et al., 1946; Jakob, 1957 ; Yeh and Chen., 2001b) as

    Unlike the known values of the inlet concentrations, iaC ,  and ibC , , the outlet 
concentrations, eaC ,  and ebC , , in Eq. (3) are not specified prior. Therefore, the calculation of

2.2.2 Double-pass operation 
    The double-pass devices of fixed configuration is similar to the single-pass one, such as 
having the membrane sheet of same size with length L and width B, except that an 
impermeable plate with negligible thickness is placed in vertical to the upper plate and the 
membrane sheet at the center line of channel a (phase a), to divide the channel into two 
subchennels (subchennels 1a  and 2a ) of same width (B/2), as shown in Fig. 2. Taking mass

2.3.1. Single-pass device 
    Substitution of Eq. (21) into Eq. (37) to eliminate ea,  gives the correction factor for 
single-pass operation as  
1F                  (38) 
This result indicates that the logarithmic mean of concentration difference lmC)(  defined in 
Eq. (3) is exactly the averaged concentration difference for single-pass operation. 
2.3.2. Double-pass device 
    Substitution of Eqs. (32) into Eq. (37) results in the expression of correction factors for 
double-pass operation, and the results are expressed graphically in Figs. 3 and 4 for 
convenient use. It is seen in these figures that the correction factors can be estimated directly 
without using the trial-and-error method, which should be employed in the conventional 
correction-factor analysis because there exist the unknown solute outlet concentrations in the 
conventional correction-factor charts. Therefore, the calculation procedure for mass-transfer 
rate in double-pass membrane mass exchangers is improved in present study.  
Experiment 
2.4. Membrane extraction 
    The double-pass experiments for membrane extraction were carried out with the use of a 
membrane sheet ( L = B = 0.165 m) made of microporous polypropylene ( Gelman science, 
average pore size of m2.0 , porosity (  ) of 70% and thickness ( t ) of m178 ) as a 
 9 
 
(phase a), dialysate (phase b) and solution within membrane (phase c) are composed of the 
same solvent (water) only slightly different in concentration, the solute (urea) concentrations 
are proportional to their activities. Thus, concentration gradients may be used to satisfactorily 
describe the driving force of dialysis, and Hac = Hbc = 1. The experimental apparatus and 
operation conditions are almost the same as those performed for water-acetic acid-MIBK 
system, while the samples of outlet streams were analyzed by UV spectrum detector. Some of 
the experimental results are given in Figs. 8 and 9. 
Results and discussion 
2.5. Comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental results 
2.5.1 Membrane extraction (water-acetic acid-MIBK system) 
    The following linear correlation equations for estimating the average values of overall 
mass-transfer coefficient applicable to such small velocity range were obtained with 
0=b,iC and

    Some of the prediction results of mass-transfer rate in double-pass membrane mass 
exchangers for water-acetic acid-MIBK system were calculated from Eqs. (9) and (39)-(41) 
coupled with use of the modified correction-factor charts, Figs. 3 and 4, for the comparison 
with the experimental results. The experimental results confirm well with the theoretical 
predictions for feed concentration, 3 50  mmolkg.C i,a , while for 3  2  mmolkgC i,a , the 
prediction values are rather higher than the experimental results as shown in Fig. 7. This is 
 11 
 
concentration difference defined by Eq. (3) is exactly the average concentration difference, 
and thus, 1=F . However, if we still follow the conventional method (Bowman et al., 1946; 
Jakob, 1957 ; Yeh and Chen, 2001a) for estimating the overall mass-transfer rate W with the 
use of Eqs. (2) and (3), the trial-and-error method should be employed because that the outlet 
solute concentrations, eaC ,  and ebC , , in Eq. (3) are unknown. Nevertheless, there do not 
exist eaC ,  and ebC ,  in the present modified equation, Eq. (9), and the values of W for 
single-pass operations are directly calculated merely setting 1=F . 
2.6.2. Double-pass operation 
    For the mass-transfer rates in double-pass membrane mass exchangers, one may better 
also employ the modified equation, Eq. (9), instead of using the conventional equation, Eq. 
(2). However, if the values of F are still determined from the conventional correction-factor 
charts (Bowman et al., 1946; Jakob, 1957 ; Yeh and Chen, 2001a), the trial-and-error method 
has to be performed because there are the unknown outlet solute concentrations, eaC ,  and 
ebC , , in these conventional charts. Alternately, one may employ the modified correction-factor 
charts, Figs. 3 and 4, constructed in present work, in which neither eaC ,  nor ebC ,  exists, and 
the calculation for mass-transfer rate is easy and direct. 
 
3. Conclusion 
    The modified expression, Eq. (9), for calculating the mass transfer rates in the 
parallel-flow multipass rectangular membrane mass exchangers was combined and modified 
from the conventional mass-transfer equations, Eqs. (2) and (3), with the use of mass-balance 
equations, Eqs. (7) and (8). With the use of this modified equation, the mass-transfer rate can 
be calculated directly without employing trial-and-error method because there no longer exist
