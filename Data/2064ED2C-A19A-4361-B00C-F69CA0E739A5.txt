二、緣由與目的 
 
Recent advances in organic electronics and optoelectronics, such as organic light-emitting 
devices, organic photoreceptors, organic solar cells, and organic photorefractive materials etc., 
have called for electroactive organic materials.  Further advances of these technologies 
substantially rely on development of high-performance organic charge-transport materials and 
understanding of charge transport in condensed organic systems.  These have been the main 
objectives of this joint project.  To achieve such objectives, this joint project has therefore 
assembled an interdisciplinary team, which has a wide range of backgrounds: from synthetic 
organic chemistry, materials characterization, organic thin film processing and devices, to 
electrical and optical analyses of condensed organic materials. 
With such objectives and expertise of the team members, the scope of this joint project will 
include synthesis of new functional materials, preparation and manipulation of materials into 
different condensed phases, characterization of charge transport properties, detailed investigation 
of transport mechanisms and correlation with molecular structures and morphology etc., studies 
of photophysical properties of the developed materials, and pursuit of possible electronic and 
optoelectronic applications of developed materials.

The synthetic route to well defined carbazol-3,9-diyl-based oligomers (30– 34 ) is shown in 
Scheme 1. Compounds 27– 29 were prepared by the Ullmann coupling reaction of 3-iodo-9H-
carbazole (7) with an excess of diphenylamine (26). The crude mixture (27– 29) was treated with 
an excess of iodocompound: 3-iodo-9-ethylcarbazole (8) or p-iodoanisole, respectively, to 
provide carbazole based oligomers (30– 34) which were separated to individual compounds by 
silica gel column chromatography.  All compounds 27- 34 were identified by mass spectrometry, 
IR and electronic absorption, as well as 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.

Thermal properties of the materials were examined using DSC and TGA analysis under a 
nitrogen atmosphere. TGA measurements (Fig. 1) revealed that the oligomers 30– 34 are highly 
thermally stable. The onset of decomposition for the materials occurs only above 315 -380 °C. 
Especially high thermal stability was observed for oligomer 34. The temperature of initial 
decomposition for 34 was 383 °C, and 5 % weight loss was observed at 450 °C. It is evident that 
the values of TID of the compounds can be increased by attachment of an additional carbazol-3,9-
diyl fragment (cf. TID of 30 with that of 31, and 33 with that of 34). TID depends also on the end 
group of the oligomer. Compounds with 4-methoxyphenyl-end group are more thermally stable 
than that with ethyl-end group (cf. TID of 30 with that of 33, and 31 with that of 34). 
 
 
 
 
These branched oligomers were obtained as amorphous glasses as confirmed by DSC. When the 
samples of 30– 34 were heated the glass-transitions were observed at 111 oC for 30, 154 oC for 
31, 123 oC for 33 and at 162 oC for 34, and no peaks due to crystallization and melting appeared.  
Cooling down and the following repeated heating revealed only the glass transition again. All the 
attempts to crystallize the compounds in different solvents failed. The transparent amorphous 
films of these materials can be prepared by casting or spin coating from solutions.

Comparison of the values of Tg shows that increase of the number of carbazol-3,9-diyl 
fragments leads to the increase of Tg by ca. 40 oC. For example, the temperature of compound 30 
is by 43 oC lower than that of compound 31, and Tg of 33 is by 39 oC lower than that of 
compound 33.  It is also evident that the values of Tg of the compounds can be varied by 
changing end group of the oligomers. Compounds with 4-methoxyphenyl-end group demonstrate 
higher Tg than those with ethyl-end group (cf. TID of 30 with that of 33, and 31 with that of 34). 
The electronic absorption and fluorescence spectra of dilute solutions and thin films of 
compounds 30 – 34 were recorded. As an example, the spectra of oligomer 34 are shown in Fig. 
3 and the pertinent data are presented in Table 1.

achieving such an object, novel molecules containing both bulky carbazol-3,9-diyl groups and 
flexible diphenylamino- end cap have been designed and synthesised, and their various thermal, 
photophysical and device properties were studied in this year of this project.  The molecular

Thermal properties of other compounds were reported last year, and DSC of SG51 is shown 
in Figure 1. When SG51 was heated glass transition was observed at ~110°C, and no peaks due 
 12
 
EV1, which is entirely composed of carbazole units as SG51, shows a 0.2 eV red-shift in 
triplet energy compared with SG51. This is probably due to the coupling of two carbazole dimers 
via 3(3’) positions in EV1, resulting in conjugation of neighboring carbazole units, thus reducing 
the triplet energy. 
(3) OLEDs with SG51 as Host for a Triplet Emitter 
SG51 with the highest triplet energy was used as host in phosphorescent OLED studies and 
device results exhibit promises of the present carbazole oligomers for phosphoresecent OLED 
applications.  
The devices were fabricated on glass substrates and have the typical structure of multiple 
organic layers sandwiched between the bottom ITO anode and the top metal cathode.  Before use 
in device fabrication, the ITO-coated glass substrates were carefully cleaned.  Cleaned ITO 
substrates were further treated with UV-ozone right before organic deposition. 
The conducting polymer polyethylene dioxythiophene:polystyrene sulphonate (PEDT:PSS) 
was used as the hole injection layer, a 40 nm N,N'-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-diphenyl-benzidine 
(α-NPD) was used as the hole-transport layer (HTL), and tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum 
(Alq3) as the electron-transport layer. The thickness of Alq3 was varied among device a (30nm), 
device b (40nm) and device c (50nm). The emissive layer (EML) consists of 20 nm of SG51 
doped with 6 wt. % of the green phosphor fac-tris(2-phenylpyridine)-iridium Ir(ppy)3. A thin 
hole blocking layer of 10 nm of 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) was 
inserted between the EML and the ETL to provide exciton and carrier confinement. The cathode 
consists of a thin LiF layer (0.5 nm) as the electron injection layer and a thick Al layer (150 nm) 
as the metal electrode. All organic materials were purified by repeated thermal gradient 
sublimation before use.  The deposition rate of organic layers was kept at about 0.2 nm/s.  The 
active area of the device is 1x1 mm2, as defined by the shadow mask for cathode deposition. 
The I-V-L characteristics of the devices are shown in Figure 4. The injected current increases 
with decreasing Alq3 thickness, possibly due to the poor electron mobility of Alq3. The present 
device possesses a turn-on voltage ~ 5 V. Figure 5 shows ηext and the power efficiency ηp as 
functions of the current density. A maximum ηext ~ 5 % and ηp = 7.2 lm/W were achieved for 
device b. This can attributed to the highest optical out-coupling efficiency of device b, and also 
to its compromise between carrier injection (favored in smaller Alq3 thicknesses) and prevention 
of carrier diffusion to the cathode (favored in larger Alq3 thicknesses). The devices showed a 
gradual decrease of ηext with increasing current, which is often observed in phosphorescent 
OLEDs and is usually attributed to triplet – triplet annihilation. The device performances are 
promising but not perfect yet, considering the host triplet energy to be as high as 2.95 eV. Such 
consequences are most probably due to imperfect carrier injection into the emission layer, as can 
be seen from the rather high turn-on voltage, and probably also to the exciton quenching in 
adjacent layers of lower triplet energies due to exciton diffusion.  It is believed that further 
optimization of the device structures (e.g. carrier-transport layers, electrodes etc.) will further 
increase the device EL efficiency.  It will be important tasks of the project in the following year. 
From Figure 6, it is evident that the EL spectrum consists entirely of the emission of Ir(ppy)3, 
and no emission from SG51 is observed, indicative of complete energy transfer from SG51 to 
Ir(ppy)3. Such results are reasonable considering the high triplet energy of the host SG51. 
Further significant improvements in device performances shall be possible with better 
understandings in the energy levels and carrier transport and injection properties of various

loss) over 300 ºC (Table 1) in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and distinct glass transitions 
(with Tg’s of ~70-150 ºC) in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (Fig. 2 and Table 1). 
Interestingly, no other phase transitions (e.g. crystallization) could be detected up to 250 ºC in 
repeated DSC heating and cooling scans, indicating that they are truly stable amorphous 
materials as desired for OLED applications. In general, with similar end substitution at the 9 
position (either alkyl or phenyl), trimers have higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) than 
dimers (i.e. TCz1 vs. BCz1, TCz2 vs. BCz2), presumably due to larger molecular weight. On 
the other hand, for the same oligomer length, rigid and bulkier phenyl end-substitution (e.g. 
BCz2 and TCz2) gives higher Tg’s than alkyl end-substitution (e.g. BCz1 and TCz1). Among 
these compounds, TCz2 gives the most impressive and highest Tg of 150 ºC, which is among 
the highest Tg reported for host materials of blue electrophosphorescence.  With these thermal 
properties, all four 3(6),9’-linked oligocarbazoles are able to form homogeneous and stable 
amorphous films by thermal evaporation. 
 
The photophysical properties (room temperature absorption and fluorescence, and 77 K 
phosphorescence) of all carbazole compounds are summarized in Table 1, and Fig. 3 explicitly 
shows the absorption, fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra of the 3,9’-linked bicarbazole 
BCz1 in comparison with those of the unsubstituted carbazole monomer (Cz).  The carbazole 
monomer has large triplet energy of 3.02 eV (i.e. the transition energy of T1→S0 estimated from 
the highest-energy phosphorescence peak at 409 nm). With more extended conjugation 
compared to the monomer, the 3,3’-linked bicarbazole BCz3 shows a significant red shift in both 
absorption (~15 nm), fluorescence (~63 nm), and phosphorescence (~39 nm) (Table 1), leading 
to a substantially lower triplet energy of 2.77 eV (448 nm). On the other hand, all the 3(6),9’-
linked oligocarbazoles show nearly the same absorption peak wavelengths (343-344 nm) as the 
monomer.  Although these 3(6),9’-linked oligocarbazoles also exhibit certain red shift in 
fluorescence (22-38 nm), the shift in phosphorescence (4-7 nm for bicarbazoles and 13-15 nm 
for tricarbazoles) is surprisingly small. These 3(6),9’-linked oligocarbazoles therefore show 
nearly the same triplet energies (~2.98-3.00 eV for bicarbazoles) or only slightly reduction of 
triplet energies (~2.92-2.94 eV for tricarbazoles) compared to the monomer. Such triplet energies 
are large enough for applications in blue electrophosphorescence, i.e. for confining triplet 
excitons on phosphorescent dopants and for preventing reverse energy transfer. 
 
The interesting photophysical properties of 3(6),9’-linked oligocarbazoles were further 
investigated with quantum chemical calculation.  In the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) triplet 
states for 3,9’-linked and 3,3’-linked bicarbazoles (BCz1 and BCz3), spin-contamination of 
various degrees was seen.  As a result, analyses based on the two singly occupied molecular 
orbitals (MOs) are no longer reliable.  Instead, we have focused on the spin density from the 
Mulliken population analysis, which indicates the location of unpaired α spin densities and 
therefore the triplet state location.  As shown in Table 2, the lowest triplet excitation of BCz1 is 
localized to the ethyl-substituted carbazole fragment, while for the 3,3’-linked BCz3, it is 
delocalized to both fragments.  The same localization or delocalization of spin density for both 
molecules is seen in all other triplet configurations we found, irrespective of their state energy or 
spin contamination (data not shown).  This result is in agreement with the observed data.  The 
small shift in phosphorescence wavelength of the 3(6),9’-linked carbazole oligomers is likely 
due to a monomeric triplet state, while delocalized triplet excitation may have led to the more 
significant red shift in the 3,3’-linked bicarbazole.   
 
The singlet excited states of the bicarbazoles were studied with time dependent density 
functional theory (TDDFT) with the hybrid B3LYP functional and the attachment-detachment 
density analysis. In a transition from a ground state to an excited state, the detachment density 
 3
vs. 20 nm) in the TCz1 device, lower operation voltage and thus higher power efficiency indeed 
were observed (Table 3).  Efficiency roll-off at higher currents typical in phosphorescent OLEDs 
[1-8] is also observed here, yet at the practical brightness of 100 cd/m2, efficiencies above 13.5%, 
27 cd/A and 17 lm/W can be obtained.  In summary, devices using the present 3(6),9’-linked 
oligocarbazoles achieve EL quantum efficiencies and power efficiencies among the highest 
reported for blue electrophosphorescence. 
 
In summary, we report a series of 3(6),9’-linked carbazole oligomers with large triplet 
energies and morphological stability as effective host materials for electrophosphorescence. 
Unlike 3(6),3’(6’)- and 2(7),2’(7)-linked carbazole oligomers, the triplet excitation of the 
3(6),9’-linked systems appears to be rather confined within one carbazole unit as in the monomer, 
leading to surprisingly small reduction of triplet energies compared to the carbazole monomer 
and a new molecular design strategy for large-triplet-energy host materials.  Using these new 
host materials, efficient blue phosphorescent OLEDs having efficiencies up to 15%, 31 cd/A and 
28 lm/W are demonstrated.

Abstract 
 
New organic electro-active materials for optoelectronic and electronic devices have been synthesized 
and studied. Both polymeric and low-molar-mass materials representing p-and n-type organic 
semiconductors have been synthesized and characterized. Their  optical, thermal, photoelectrical, photo-
physical, etc. properties have been studied. 
Well defined 3,9'-linked carbazole oligomers were synthesized by multi-step procedure. Unlike 3,6- 
and 2,7-linked carbazole oligomers, the conjugation of the 3,9'-linked systems is rather confined within 
one carbazole unit, retaining large triplet energies suitable for blue electro-phosphorescence. Devices 
prepared using the newly designed and synthesized oligocarbazoles achieve external quantum efficiencies 
among the highest reported for blue electro-phosphorescence, yet more importantly they achieve a power 
efficiency doubling the highest values previously reported for blue electro-phosphorescence. 
Indolyl-substituted carbazoles and di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-yl)arylamines which exhibit high thermal 
stability and form amorphous films have been prepared and characterized. The values of ionisation 
potential (4.9 - 5.6 eV) and the hole drift mobility (5×10-6 cm2V-1s-1 at an electric field of 8.1×105 Vcm-1) 
studies show that these compounds can be used as hole- transport materials in optoelectronic devices. 
Naphtalene tetracarboxylic diimide-based electron transporting monomers and  polymers have been 
synthesized and studied. The electron-drift mobilities (up to 10-6 cm2V-1s-1 at high electric fields) 
observed in the layers of the materials present them as promising electron-transport materials for 
optoelectronic devices. 
Triphenylamine based derivatives having long alkoxy chains were prepared and tested as model 
compounds of liquid crystalline materials. Polarized optical microscopy and differential scanning 
calorimetry demonstrated that a meso-phase is obtained for the material. Optoelectronic studies of the 
derivative are underway. 
Polymeric materials containing indandione derivatives were studied as second-order non-linear 
optical (NLO) systems. Quantum chemical calculations of the compounds, which are useful for 
understanding their behaviour as NLO chromophores, were performed. The high value of susceptibility 
( 53233d =80 pm/V, frequency corrected value 
0
33d =12 pm/V) was observed.  
The synthetic work was carried out at Department of Organic Technology, Kaunas University of 
Technology and Faculty of Materials Science and Applied Chemistry, Riga Technical University. 
Investigation of the materials was performed mainly at the Department of Electrical Engineering and 
Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan Univeristy.

1. 3-(9-Carbazolyl)carbazoles and 3,6-di(9-carbazolyl)cabazoles as effective 
host materials for efficient blue organic electro-phosphorescence 
 
Recent development of efficient phosphorescent emitters containing transition metals 
renders possible harvesting both electro-generated singlet and triplet excitons for emission from 
organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) and realizing nearly 100% internal quantum efficiencies 
of electroluminescence (EL) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-8]. In making efficient phosphorescent OLEDs, 
effective host materials are as important for reducing quenching associated with relatively long 
excited-state lifetimes of triplet emitters (e.g. concentration quenching and triplet-triplet 
annihilation etc.) For efficient electro-phosphorescence from triplet guests, it is essential that the 
triplet level of the host be larger than that of the triplet emitter to prevent reverse energy transfer 
from the guest back to the host and to effectively confine triplet excitons on guest molecules. 
Such a requirement becomes particularly challenging when blue electro-phosphorescence is of 
interest [3-8], in which the conjugation in the host molecules must be extremely confined to 
achieve a triplet energy level of ≥2.8 eV. As such, to date reported host materials for blue 
electrophosphorescence are limited within few structure features such as carbazole and 
phenylsilane [4-8], among which only carbazole-based materials are electrically active.  
For carbazole-based molecules to form morphologically stable and uniform amorphous thin 
films with typical processing techniques, the molecule size must be extended beyond one 
carbazole monomer to obtain bulky and steric molecular configurations. This may be achieved 
by (non-conjugatedly) attaching carbazoles to an inert central linkage (i.e with very limited 
conjugation and large gaps). The more straightforward approach, however, is to directly link 
carbazoles to form oligocabazoles. 3,3'-Linked and 2,2'-linked oligocarbazoles indeed had been 
explored in the literature as host materials for electrophoshorescence.  Since 3,3'- and 2,2'- 
linking lead to conjugation beyond one carbazole unit and thus substantial reduction of the triplet 
energy [9, 10], they are useful for green and red electro-phosphorescence but not for blue. 
Carbazole oligomers can also be formed through 3,9'-linking, yet it is interesting to note that 
3,9'-linked oligocarbazoles have never been considered for phosphorescent applications. In the 
frame of this project, we have developed a series of 3,9'-linked carbazole oligomers with large 
triplet energies as effective host materials for blue electro-phosphorescence. 
The chemical structures and the synthetic pathways of carbazole dimmers and trimers under 
investigation are shown in Scheme 1.1. Three classes of carbazole oligomers were studied, 
including the 3,9'-linked (and 6,9'-linked) oligomers with the 9 position end-capped with alkyl 
 15
The photophysical properties (absorption, fluorescence, and phosphorescence at 77 K) of all 
carbazole compounds are summarized in Table 1.1, and Fig. 1.1 explicitly shows the absorption, 
fluorescence and phosphorescence spectra of 3,9-linked oligocarbazoles BCz1 and TCz1, in 
comparison with those of the unsubstituted carbazole monomer and the 3,3'-linked dimmer 
BCz3.

Fig. 1.1. Absorption (room temperature), fluorescence (room termperature) and phosphorescence 
(77 K) spectra of 3,9-linked oligocarbazoles BCz1 and TCz1 (in toluene, 1×10-5 M), in 
comparison with those of the unsubstituted carbazole monomer and the 3,6-linked dimmer BCz3.  
 
 
In Fig. 1.1, it is seen that the carbazole monomer has relatively large triplet energy of 3.02 
eV (i.e. the transition energy of T1→S0 estimated from the highest-energy phosphorescence peak 
at 410 nm). With larger conjugation compared to a monomer, BCz3 shows a significantly red 
shift in both fluorescence (~30 nm) and phosphorescence (~40 nm), leading to a substantially 
lower triplet energy of 2.75 eV (450 nm). In contrast, due to stronger localization of triplet wave 
functions, both BCz1 and TCz1 show a much less lowering of the triplet energies, giving triplet 
energies of 2.99 eV (415 nm) and 2.92 eV (425 nm), respectively. Such triplet energies shall be 
large enough for applications in blue electro-phosphorescence, i.e. for confining triplet excitons 
on phosphorescent dopants and for preventing reverse energy transfer.  From the results shown 
in Table 1.1, it is also noticed that the 9 position of carbazole end-capped with phenyl 
 17
Fig. 1.2. DSC traces of four 3,9-linked carbazole oligomers. 
 
In general, with similar end substitution at the 9 position (either alkyl or phenyl), trimers 
have higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) than dimmers (i.e. TCz1 vs. BCz1, TCz2 vs. 
BCz2), presumably due to larger molecular weight.  On the other hand, for the same oligomer 
length, oligocarbazoles with more rigid and bulkier phenyl end-substitution (i.e. BCz2 and 
TCz2) give higher Tg’s than those with alkyl end-substitution (i.e. BCz1 and TCz1).  Among 
all these compounds, TCz2 gives the most impressive and highest Tg of 150 ºC, which is 
probably the highest Tg ever reported for host materials suitable for blue 
electrophosphorescence.  With these thermal properties, all four oligocarbazoles are able to 
form homogeneous and stable amorphous films by thermal evaporation. 
The interesting properties of 3(6),9’-linked oligocarbazoles were further investigated with 
quantum chemical calculation. The optimal structures for the triplet state were obtained at the 
UB3LYP/6-31G* level, with a number of different starting configurations, and subsequently 
triplet state configurations were calculated with UHF/6-31G*. Stability analysis was performed 
for all results to ensure a stable solution.  Since we have observed severe spin contamination 
(〈S2〉 > 3) in the lowest energy solutions, the HOMOs for the α spin may not represent the 
triplet spin distribution properly.  Instead we report spin population (difference of α and β spin 
densities) for each molecular fragment, which is a summation over the atomic values of the 
Mulliken spin population analysis.  The singlet excitation was calculated from an optimized 
ground state structure (B3LYP/6-31G*) by time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) 
at the B3LYP/6-31G*level. A developmental version of Q-CHEM [16] quantum chemistry 
program was used for all calculations. 
In the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) triplet states for 3,9’-linked and 3,3’-linked 
bicarbazoles (BCz1 and BCz3), a various degree of spin-contamination was seen [17].  As a 
result, analyses based on the two singly occupied molecular orbitals (MOs) are no longer 
reliable.  Instead, we have focused on the spin density from the Mulliken population analysis, 
which indicates the location of unpaired α spin densities and therefore the triplet state location.

Fig. 1.3. Detachment (to the left of the arrows) and attachment (to the right) densities for the first 
two singlet excited states of (a) BCz1 and (b) BCz3.   
 
 
It is seen that the first singlet excited state of BCz1 has a strong charge-transfer (CT) 
character, as indicated by the different localization in the detachment and attachment densities.  
This CT transition has a low oscillator strength, and it can account for the broadening of 
absorption at the long wavelength side.  In the second state, the excitation is localized to one 
fragment, which corresponds to the small shift in the observed absorption maximum (Figure 
1.2).  In contrast, delocalized excitation is seen in BCz3, which explains the red shift in the 
corresponding absorption wavelength. 
Computational analysis may help us understand the origin of localized excitations in the 
3,9’-linked systems.  The substituents in BCz1 and BCz2 have perturbed the energy of the 
carbazole fragment they attach to, leading to an asymmetric situation, as opposed to the 
symmetric BCz3.  The dihedral angle in BCz1 was also found to be much larger than that in 
triplet BCz3, resulting to a reduced orbital overlap and therefore a smaller triplet-triplet 
coupling [ 22 ].  Since the transition dipole moment of the lowest monomeric carbazole 
excitation is along the long axis, the singlet-singlet coupling, as approximated by the dipole-
dipole coupling, is reduced in BCz1 by the large angle between the long axes of two carbazole 
fragments, as opposed to a more parallel arrangement in BCz3 that allows a large dipole-dipole 
interaction. 
 With high triplet energies, these 3,9-linked oligocarbazoles are considered as promising 
hosts for blue electro-phosphorescence, and they have been subjected to electro-phosphorescence 
studies.  The devices were fabricated on glass substrates with the typical structure of multiple 
organic layers sandwiched between the bottom indium tin oxide (ITO) anode and the top metal

2. Indolyl-substituted carbazole derivatives as amorphous electro-active 
materials for optoelectronics 
 
Aromatic amine and/or hydrazone based molecular glasses belong to the classes of light 
emitting and charge-transporting materials and are known for various applications such as 
electrophotographic photoreceptors, organic light-emitting diodes, photovoltaic cells, 
photorefractive materials [2829]. For the purpose of developing electronically active molecular 
glasses, we have been studying the synthesis, properties and applications of novel molecules 
based on aromatic amines, hydrazones and other classes of organic compounds. We have 
reported previously several series of hole-transporting compounds: 3,6-Di(aryl)carbazoles 
having different substituents at 9th position of the central carbazole ring [30, 31] as well as 
carbazole-based dihydrazones [32,33]. The carbazole derivatives showed hole drift mobilities up 
to 10-2 cm2/Vs at high electric fields [34]. 
In the frame of this project we have prepared glass-forming indolyl-containing compounds. 
Indolyl group until now is a relatively little studied as a building block in the design and 
synthesis of organic electro-active materials. 
Indol-1-yl substituted-9-alkylcarbazoles (6 -7 and 13) were prepared as described in 
Scheme 2.1 via the Ullmann coupling reaction of the corresponding iodo derivative of 9-
alkylcarbazole (3 – 4 or 12) with an excess of indole (5). The iodo-derivatives were prepared by 
alkylation of iodo carbazoles (2 or 11) which were synthesized by the Tucker iodination of 9H-
carbazole (1) in the presence of KI and KIO3. 3,6-Di(indol-1-yl)-9-(2-ethylhexyl)carbazole (7) 
was used for the preparation of dihydrazone 10 by two-step reaction as shown in Scheme 2.1. 
The first step was Vilsmeier formylation of the indolyl groups to get diformyl derivative 8. The 
second step was condensation of the dialdehyde with N-methyl-N-phenylhydrazine (9). 
All the newly synthesized compounds were identified by mass spectrometry, IR and 
electronic absorption, as well as 1H NMR spectroscopy. The data were found to be in good 
agreement with the proposed structures. The indolyl substituted carbazole derivatives were 
readily soluble in common organic solvents, such as tetrachloroethane, chloroform, THF and 
acetone at the room temperature. Transparent thin amorphous films of these materials could be 
prepared by casting or spin coating from solutions.

application in optoelectronic devices. The onset of decomposition for hydrazone 10 occurs above 
260 °C, while aromatic amines exhibit higher thermal stability. Especially high thermal stability 
was observed for compound 7. The temperature of initial decomposition (TID) for 7 was 332 °C, 
and 5 % weight loss was observed at ca. 410 °C.

3,6-Di(indol-1-yl)-9-alkylcarbazoles (6 and 7) were obtained as polycrystals by 
recrystallisation from solution, however they readily formed glasses when the melt samples were 
cooled on standing in air or with liquid nitrogen. The DSC thermograms of 7 are shown in 
Figure 2.2a. When the crystalline sample was heated, the endothermic peak due to melting was 
observed at 143 oC. When the melt sample was cooled down and heated again, the glass-
transition phenomenon was observed at 47 oC and on further heating no peaks due to 
crystallisation and melting appeared. The crystalline sample of compound 6 demonstrated the 
similar behaviour. It melts on first heating at 162 oC and forms glass (Tg = 40 oC) upon cooling.

Photophysical properties (absorption, fluorescence, and phosphorescence at 77 K) of indol-
1-yl substituted-9-alkylcarbazoles 7 and 13 are summarized in Figure 2.3. It is seen that the 
derivatives synthesized demonstrate relatively large triplet energies of 2.7 eV.  Such triplet 
energies shall be large enough for applications in blue electrophosphorescence, i.e. for confining 
triplet excitons on phosphorescent dopants and for preventing reverse energy transfer.  From the 
results shown in Figure 2.3, it is also noticed that the second substitution of carbazole ring with 
indolyl fragment (i.e. 7 and 13) hardly has any effect on the photophysical characteristics.  
The blue electro-phosphorescent devices prepared using indol-1-yl substituted-9-
alkylcarbazoles as a host materials are studied in Department of Electrical engineering and 
Graduate Institute of Electrooptical engineering at National Taiwan University. 
The structure of the fluorescence bands of 7 and 13 is similar to that of other carbazole-
conataining compounds [ 35 ]. However, dihydrazone 10 demonstrates the red shift of FL 
emission and UV absorption with respect of 9-ethylcarbazole as well as of indol-1-yl substituted 
9-alkylcarbazoles (6 – 7 and 13). This observation indicates that hydrazine moiety in the 
molecule 10 can have a considerable influence on its photoelectric properties: the red shift of UV 
 29
In conclusion, we have synthesized new indolyl-substituted carbazole derivatives which exhibit 
high thermal stability and form amorphous films with glass transition temperatures in the range 
of 40-95 °C. The photo-physical studies, values of ionisation potentials and the preliminary hole 
drift mobility studies show that these compounds are potential materials for blue 
electrophosphorescent devices.

All the newly synthesized compounds were identified by mass spectrometry, IR and 
electronic absorption, as well as 1H NMR spectroscopy. The data were found to be in good 
agreement with the proposed structures. The di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-yl)arylamines (4 - 9) were 
soluble in common organic solvents, such as tetrachloroethane, chloroform, THF and acetone at 
room temperature. Transparent and stable thin amorphous films of these materials could be 
prepared by spin coating from solutions.  
The behaviour under heating of the compounds 4 - 8 was studied by DSC and TGA under 
a nitrogen atmosphere. The values of Tg, Tm and TID are summarised in Table 3.1. All the 
derivatives demonstrate high thermal stability. The mass loss occurs at the temperatures higher 
than 367 oC, as confirmed by TGA with a heating rate of 10o C/min. It is evident that the thermal 
stability of the compounds synthesized decreases with the introduction of 4-substituted phenyl 
group to their structure (cf. TID of 4 - 5 with that of 6 - 8). TID depends also slightly on the 
substituent at p-position of phenyl group (cf. TID of 7 with that of 6 and 8).

corresponding spectra of 9-ethylcarbazole are given in this Figure. The carbazole trimers (4-5) as 
well as the series of di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-yl)phenylamines (6 - 9) exhibit very close spectra and 
only the data of derivatives 5 and 6 are shown. The electronic absorbtion energy of these 
compounds is similar, and the λmax values are in the range of 240- 330 nm. Their FL emission 
maxima appear in the region of wavelengths from 448 nm to 466 nm.

The comparison of the UV absorption and FL spectra of the di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-
yl)arylamines (5 - 6) with those of 9-ethylcarbazole indicates that the spectra of compounds 
synthesized exhibit considerable bathochromic shift with respect of the spectrum of 9-
ethylcarbazole. In the UV spectra of 5 and 6 B and R bands are submerged by the 
bathochromically and hyperchromically shifted K bands attributed to π→π∗ transitions [54]. 
This observation shows that molecules of di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-yl)arylamines are significantly π- 
conjugated through the aryl units and the lone electron pair at the central nitrogen atom and that 
π-electrons are de-localised over these molecules. The bands of fluorescence spectra of 5 and 6 
are also shifted towards longer wavelength region relative to those of 9-ethylcarbazole. In the 
same manner with the red shift of UV absorption and FL emission, which is interpreted as the 
extended conjugation, stabilizing the oxidized state of the compounds, they are expected to 
demonstrate lower values of ionization potentials (Ip) than compounds containing unsubstituted 
carbazole rings. 
The photoemission spectra of compounds 5 and 6 are presented in Figure 3.3. For the 
comparison the spectrum of poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) containing unsubstituted carbazole

The room temperature µh show a linear dependence on the square root of the electric field 
in films of the compositions. This characteristic dependence is observed for the majority of non-
crystalline organic systems and can be attributed to the effects of disorder on charge transport 
[57]. The compositions of 6 or 7 with PC-Z (50 %) demonstrated hole drift mobility values 
reaching 2×10-6 cm2/Vs at an electric field of 8.1×105 V/cm at room temperature. These values 
are by ca. one order of magnitude higher than those observed in layers of classical 
photoconductor poly(N-vinylcarbazole). 
In conclusion, we have synthesized various di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-yl)arylamine based 
derivatives which exhibit high thermal stability and form amorphous films with glass transition 
temperatures in the range of 40-147 °C. Some of the compounds were converted to cross-
linkable derivatives which are potential components for preparation of insoluble electroactive 
layers. The values of ionisation potentials (4.9 eV- 5.0 eV) of the materials and the preliminary 
hole drift mobility studies have showed that these compounds are potential materials for 
electrophotographic photoreceptors and multilayer electroluminescent devices.

Polymer 2 was prepared from oxyranyl- functionalized naphtalene diimide as described in 
Scheme 4.2. The key step was the synthesis of unsymetrical naphtalene bisimide using different 
alkyl-substituted arylamines. Monofunctional naphtalene diimide was obtained after the 
condensation with epichlorhydrine in the next step. Oligomer 2 was prepared by polymerization 
of the monomer using BF3·O(C2H5)2 as a cationic catalyst.

Optoelectronic characteristics of the compound will be studied in the near future. 
 
 
 
6. New second-order non-linear optical polymer materials containing 
indandione derivatives as a chromophore 
 
The advancement molecular photonic devices is highly dependent on the development and 
characterization of new materials possessing high non-linear optical (NLO) response at the 
molecular level and capable of forming organized non-centro-symmetric molecular structures for 
device application. 
We have studied original indandione derivatives as novel class of the NLO chromophores. 
Two groups of compounds have been investigated – one based on indandione-1,3 pyridinium 
betaine (IPB), another one on dimethylaminobenzylidene -1, 3 - indandione (DMABI). The 
potential of indandione derivatives and success in the synthetic strategy has been described in 
several articles [61, 62]. IPB was first compound extensively investigated as possible candidate 
for future photonic applications. The hyperpolarizability β of the IPB molecule have been 
measured in chloroform solution by the hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS). Averaged effective 
value of IPB molecule yielded β = (138 ± 16)x10-30 esu measured at the 1064 nm [63], or 
extrapolated to zero frequency using the two-level model [64] - β0= 48 x 10-30 esu. 
One of the choices to obtain material with high chromophor concentration and noncentro-
symmetrical molecular assembly is to produce z-type Langmuir –Blodget film. Therefore, two 
amphiphilic IPB derivatives C11IPB and C17IPB of the IPB were tested [65,66,67]. It has been 
shown that z-type LB films of C17IPB could be produced. Unfortunately, the LB deposition 
process of C17IPB z-type LB films was hardly reproducible. By that reason and from the 
practical point of view, another pathway to form noncentro-symmetrical molecular assemblies 
containing IPB chromophore – poled polymer films was applied. There have been synthesized 
several polymers with IPB attached to polymer backbone. The films of the polyurethane 
polymer containing IPB units were investigated by Maker fringe technique. The SHG 
susceptibility 53233d = 25 pm/V was found [68] and extrapolation to zero frequency yielded to

Scheme 6.1 
 
 
To obtain highly effective second order NLO host – guest polymer material there are 
several obvious considerations, what we are shearing with other investigators [75], concerning 
chromophore molecule properties. Simple analysis can be done on the basis of the well-known 
expression for 〉〈∝ θβ 333 cosFNd , where N and β is number density and first hyperpolarizabilities 
of chromophore, F – local field factor and 〉〈 θ3cos  average orientation factor. In our case of the 
DMABI related compounds we could apply two - level model [64] for 
hyperpolarizability 3/)( egegge Efµµβ −∝ , where µg  and µe is ground and excited state dipole 
moment, f - oscillator strength and Eeg – transition energy. As one can notice β is related to ∆µ, 
so high ground state dipole is not necessary to achieve high β values. It is clearly evident, that 
high values of the µg, leads to chromophore association in centro-symetrical aggregates with no 
NLO activity. So, low µg allows us to increase number density of NLO active chromophores. At 
the same time, if we applying electric field poling technique to create polar order of the 
chromophore molecules in material, we should have nonzero µg, because poling efficiency can 
be expressed as kTEpg /µη ∝ , where Ep is poling field and T - poling temperature. We could 
compensate low µg by applying higher Ep, but it could cause unwelcome side effects, for 
instance, electrical breakdown of film. It is also obvious that equation for d33 must be corrected 
when β and µg is not parallel (anti-parallel) – effective contribution to bulk non-linear suscebility 
in electrical field poled polymer materials will come from β projection over µg -

Fig. 6.1. Example of molecular configuration in case of DMABI. Indicated carbon atoms are 
used to determine torsion angles and length of the bridge bonds presented in Table 1. 
 
 
All investigated structures can be subdivided in three groups. First of all completely flat 
ones – DMABI, tB-DMABI, D-DMABI and DMABI-OH. As a result – high oscillator strength 
values fCT ~ 1 of the CT transition. At the second group we have placed almost flat molecules – 
DMABI-dPh, DMABI-Ju and DMABI-CN. Two members of that group have similar, high fCT 
values. Exception is DMABI-Ju with rather low fCT =0.32 value. The DD-DMABI is solitary 
member of third group – group that can be characterized with rings twisted out of plane due to 
significant steric hindrance of dicyanomethylidene group with benzene ring and low oscillator 
strengths (fCT =0.36). Now let us take the closer look to the electronic properties of the 
molecules. One hydrogen atom replacement with a tret- butyl moiety (tB-DMABI) has been 
done with an aim to reduce association in matrix and keep other important from NLO point of 
view properties of the chromophore as in DMABI. As one can notice from data in Table 6.1, 
characteristics are pretty close. So, we could expect shift of the chromophore concentration 
optimum to higher values with higher bulk non-linearity. By step-by-step replacement of 
carbonyl group by dicyanomethylidene group one could expect systematically increase µg, β and 
red shift CT band maximum. This trend in some way has been broken in the case of the DD-
DMABI, due to lost conjugation by out of plane geometry. It is important that introducing of the 
large dicyanomethylidene groups instead of oxygen atoms have caused mismatch of the 
alignment between µg and β, what can dismiss contribution of the molecular hyperpolarizability 
gain to bulk non-linearity. To summarize calculation results of chromophores modified in 
electron acceptor part of the molecule, one can conclude, that calculated properties are in good 
agreement with increasing acceptor properties in predicted sequence of the tB-DMABI < 
DMABI < D-DMABI. 
Four other structures have modified electron donor part of the chromophore. It is evident 
that donor properties should decrease according to following succession – DMABI-Ju > 
DMABI > DMABI-dPh > DMABI-OH > DMABI-CN. First of all we could say, that different 
substituents molecular tailoring in donor part allows us to widen optical transparency window to 
 47
untypical for DMABI related compound spectrum calculations. Usually these calculations lead 
to large (~100 nm) difference with experiment. More detailed investigations to explanation these 
contradictory quantum chemical calculations for the DMABI-Ju are under way. 
The results of experimental investigations are presented in Table 6.2. It is worth to be 
mentioned once more, absorbance band wavelength experimental values in both solvents 
(CHCl3, EtOH), as well as in polymer matrix (sPMMA), are in good agreement with predicted 
sequences. Unfortunately very low solubility in CHCl3 of the DMABI-OH, DMABI-CN and 
partially D-DMABI disallow us to produce all planed concentration range ( 0.1 – 25 % by wt) of 
host -guest systems. In the case DMABI-OH we could not acquire sufficient quality films even 
within the lover concentrations of this range. Therefore we were able to obtain only absorbance 
band wavelength of DMABI-OH in CHCl3 solution, and get no any data for films. Better 
situation is for DMABI-CN (satisfactory quality films was produced with 0.1 and 1 % by Wt) 
and D-DMABI ( 0.1 – 9 % by Wt).

In Figure 6.3 we have presented absorbance spectra of the host – guest films for 
concentration 1% wt in sPMMA normalized to film thickness. Base line oscillations, as well as 
some kind of distortion of absorbance band shape are due to interference phenomena of light 
reflected from top and bottom interface of the film. Wavelength, band shape and intensity of the 
 49
results (considerably smaller βff values in complex with poorest alignment of β with µg, what is 
essential to electric field poled host –guest films). Of course, FF approach is not taking into 
account frequency factor, but in the case of DMABI-Ju there is the highest resonance 
enhancement of β  absorbance band maxima is very close to 532 nm. Anyhow, correction of 
532
33d to zero frequency values 033d , according to two level model [64], did not save the situation – 
DMABI-Ju is the second best by this corrected value at 1% by wt in sPMMA.  Unfortunately, 
only for that chromophore, during the Corona poling at 95ºC, we have observed the partial 
bleaching of the high concentration films (C≥ 9 wt %). Concentration threshold of this process 
can be explained due to depression of glass transition temperature of composite what causes 
better penetration of highly reactive ozone in polymer. Lowering of the poling temperature is not 
a cure for that problem, because poling efficiency drops down when temperature is well below 
glass transition.

In the Figure 6.4 we have presented concentration dependence of the bulk non-linearity for 
all chromophores investigated in planed (0.1 -25 wt%) range. From our point of view, it is 
clearly evident that for low concentration d33 values of the host – guest films are depressed by 
poor poling efficiency due to low poling temperature. At the low concentrations (C≤ 3% wt) glass 
transition temperature of the host –guest composite is close to host polymer value (in our case of

7.  Conclusions 
 
 
A series of new charge transporting compounds have been designed, synthesized and 
characterized. Their film-forming, liquid crystalline, optical, thermal, photoelectrical and photo 
physical properties have been studied. 
3,9'-Linked carbazole oligomers were investigated as potential materials for 
electrophosphorescent OLED’s. It was established that the carbazole derivatives, due to their 
large triplet energy, are highly potential as host materials for blue phosphorescent devices, which 
are still a big scientific and technical challenge. OLED’s using the present oligocarbazoles 
achieve external quantum efficiencies among the highest reported for blue electro-
phosphorescence and demonstrate a power efficiency doubling the highest values previously 
reported for blue electro-phosphorescence. 
It was established that indolyl-substituted carbazoles and di(9-alkylcarbazol-3-
yl)arylamines possess high thermal stability with glass transition temperatures in the range of 40-
147 °C. The ionisation potential (4.9 - 5.6 eV) and the hole-drift mobility studies showed that 
these compounds could be used as hole-transport materials in electro-photographic 
photoreceptors and electroluminescent devices. 
Electron transporting polymers have been synthesized and studied. The highest electron-
drift mobility up to 10-6 cm2V-1s-1 at high electric fields was shown by the polymer containing 
naphtalene tetracarboxylic diimide fragments. 
Triphenylamine based derivative having long alkoxy chains was tested as liquid crystalline 
material and demonstrated that a meso-phase is characteristic for the substance. Optoelectronic 
studies of the derivative are underway. 
Polymeric materials containing indandione derivatives as active chromophores were studied 
as second-order non-linear optical (NLO) systems. Quantum chemical calculations of the active 
compounds, which are very useful for understanding their behaviour as an NLO chromophore, 
were demonstrated. The highest value of susceptibility of 80 pm/V (frequency corrected value of 
12 pm/V) was observed in the systems.
