Abstract—The efficiency of multinode cooperative commu-
nication systems is an important issue to solve. One of the
possible solutions is the adoption of the adaptive modulation
(AM). In this work, we investigate the theoretical limitation
of the performance of a multinode cooperative communication
system with AM when decode-and-forward (DF) protocol is
utilized at each relay. With DF protocol, the uncertainty of
the decoding behavior of each relay complicates the support
of AM in a multinode cooperative communication system. This
uncertainty makes the performance analysis hard to access as
well. We approach the performance of such a system under the
assumption that the decoding results of relays are available at
the destination. Under this assumption, the derived performance
in this work is the theoretical limitation of the performance of
the system of interest. We further propose two models to mimic
the chosen modulation level of the system and the decoding
behavior of each relay. These two models help understand the
behavior of a multinode cooperative communication system when
AM and DF protocol are used. The extensive simulations are
conducted to reveal the advantage of using AM in a multinode
cooperative communication system and to verify the correctness
of the proposed models.

I. INTRODUCTION
Diversity techniques have been widely adopted to mitigate
the channel impairments in wireless environment. Among
them, the spatial diversity achieved by installing the antenna
array is a popular option. Conventionally, the multiple-input-
multiple-output (MIMO) system has been drawn much at-
tention [1] and [2]. However, equipping the mobile devises
with the antenna array is not cost efficient and restricted
by the space. In view of this, cooperative communication is
introduced to have a group of mobile devices share their own
antenna and form a virtual antenna array. The behavior and
performance of cooperative communication has been studied
extensively [3]–[5] and its potential benefit to the system
has been investigated such as lifetime improvement [6] and
coverage extension [7].
Even thought the advantage of cooperative communication
has been confirmed, the reduction in the spectral efficiency is
annoying and needs to be restored as possible. This reduction
is observed in both the realms of the relay networks and
the cooperative communication. One possible solution is the
utilization of the adaptive modulation (AM). The ability of AM
to improve the spectral efficiency has been verified in [8]. This
concept has been adopted to improve the spectral efficiency
in both the relay networks [9]–[14] and the cooperative com-
munication [15]–[19]. Hares and et al. [9] applied both the
benefit of diversity and AM into TDMA multi-hop networks.
In [11], AM scheme is utilized in a two-hop relay network with
MIMO implemented at the relay node. Muller and Speidel [12]
studied the AM scheme with regenerative relays in a multi-
hop systems. Mardani and et al. [13] further focused on the
cross-layer approach, including AM in PHY layer and ARQ
design in data link layer. Currently, AM scheme is also part
of IEEE 802.16j system [14], which is a two-hop network
with a mobile relay between the base station and the target
mobile station. Meanwhile, the same concept draws much
attention in the cooperative communication as well. Yazdian
and Pakravan [15] first worked on this subject in a single
relay cooperative communication system when the amplify-
and-forward (AF) protocol is used. Their works is followed by
Chen and Ahmed [16]. The main difference between these two
works lies in the roles of the source and the relay. Hwang and
et al. [17] proposed a mechanism of selecting the best relay
in a multinode cooperative communication system when AF
protocol is installed at the relays. However, these three works
involves only one single relay when choosing the modulation
scheme. Later, authors in [18] chose the modulation level
based on the total SNR at the destination contributed by all
relays and the source. Nevertheless, [15]–[18] focused on
how to provide AM when AF protocol is made use of in
the system and none of them considered the same problem
with decode-and-forward (DF) protocol. Later on, Kalansuriya
and Tellambura [19] accessed the performance of multinode
cooperative communication with AM and DF protocol based
on the assumption that the success of the decoding at a
relay is declared by comparing its received SNR against a
single threshold. Since the single threshold is used during the
comparison, the results in [19] are significant but cannot reflect
the theoretical limitation of performance of such a system.
Hence, the theoretical limitation of the performance of the
multinode cooperative communication systems with AM still
remains unknown when DF protocol is utilized at relays. This
will be answered in this work. Furthermore, models will be
proposed to explain the behavior of the overall systems as
well.
In this work, we investigate the performance of AM in a
multinode cooperative communication system when DF proto-
3and d(i)rd is the distance between R(i) and D, which is
d
(i)
rd =
√
dsd
2 − 2dsdd(i)sr cos θ(i) + d(i)sr
2
. Similarly, the SNR
of S−R(i) link is given by γ(i)r = β(i)sr
∣∣∣h(i)sr ∣∣∣2Es/N0 ∈ Sr[i],
which also follows the exponential distribution with mean
E{γ(i)r } = β(i)sr γ˜(i)0 , where β(i)sr , h(i)sr , and γ˜(i)0 are the path
loss effect, fading gain, and the average SNR without path
loss in this link, respectively.
In addition, we assume that the destination can perfectly
estimate all the channel conditions toward itself, which are
then used to help determine the modulation level.
C. Adaptive modulation scheme
AM scheme is adopted to improve the spectral efficiency.
In this work, D is responsible for choosing the suitable mod-
ulation level based on the channel-related information of each
relay. Once D decides the modulation level, which is defined
as number of bits per symbol, S and the relays act accordingly.
In this AM system, m ∈ {1, 2, 3, · · · ,M} is the modulation
level for 2m-ary phase shift keying (2m-PSK) modulation with
maximum allowable order M , P reqs represents the required
symbol error rate (SER), and the associated SNR thresholds
is chosen according to
ΓTHm =
1
2
(
Q−1 (P reqs /2)
sinpi/2m
)2
,
for all m, which is based on the SER of 2m-PSK [22] and
Q−1(·) is the inverse Q-function.
According to the above description, we have the modulation
level be m if and only if
ΓTHm ≤ γeq < ΓTHm+1, (1)
where γeq is the equivalent total SNR of the multinode
cooperative communication system when MRC is utilized at
D. Moreover, we say the system is cut-off if no modulation
level can be supported, namely, γeq < ΓTH1 .
D. The equivalent total SNR, γeq
To derive γeq, we first define two kinds of relay sets: the
participating relay set Ωp, Ωp ⊆ Ω and the decoding relay
set Ωd, Ωd ⊆ Ω. The participating relay set contains the
relays who are selected to participate the current transmission
by D. Based on Ωp, D will calculate the respective total
received SNR to choose a proper modulation scheme. On the
other hand, those relays in Ωd are those who can successfully
decode the signal from S and forward it to D. Under the
practical condition, Ωp and Ωd are not identical, which is the
main difficulty of applying AM in the multinode cooperative
communication systems. Under the ideal case, Ωp and Ωd are
identical. Therefore, the derived performance in this work is
the theoretical limitation of such a system. However, to make
this work more readable, we choose to use these two separate
notations to mean the same thing.
Next, let z be the combined signal after MRC based on the
signals from S and R(i) ∈ Ωp.
z =
h

∗
N0
· y(0) +
∑
{i|R(i)∈Ωp}
h
(i)
d
∗
N0
· y(i).
Then, the corresponding equivalent total SNR consists of
γeq = γ
(0)
d +
∑
{i|R(i)∈Ωp}
γ
(i)
d . (2)
Herein, given γeq,
Φ(γeq) (3)
is referred to be the chosen modulation scheme according to
(1). Based on Φ(γeq), we can restate the cut-off condition.
That is, the system is cut-off if Φ(γeq) = 0. After D chooses
the proper modulation scheme Φ(γeq) based on Ωp, those
relays in Ωd transmit the corresponding modulated symbol to
D. Finally, D detects the information based on the signals of
the same modulation scheme from S and those relays in Ωd.
III. THE IDEAL CASE AND MODELING
In this section, we would like to investigate the theoretical
limitation of the performance of the cooperative communica-
tion with AM. Thus in this case, we assume the destination
is not only able to know CSI’s of all links but also whether
the relay decodes the information symbols correctly. Based on
these two information, the system chooses the most appropri-
ate participating relay set and the most suitable modulation
level. In this section, we first introduce the mechanism of this
ideal case, and then, two behavior models corresponding to
this case will be presented.
A. Mechanism for modulation level selection
In the setup of the ideal case, we let S transmits signals cor-
responding to all different modulation levels in the first phase.
Upon receiving these signals, each relay tries to decode all of
them and D has the information regarding which modulation
levels are good for use. That is, the signals corresponding to
a modulation level can be decoded by a particular relay set.
We group these relays into Ωm ⊆ Ω, if those relays in this set
can decode the 2m-PSK symbol.
Based on the decoding behavior at each relay, the destina-
tion first computes the equivalent total SNR, γm(t), to check
whether the modulation level m is allowable or not, where
γm(t) = γ
(0)
d (t) +
N∑
i,R(i)∈Ωm
γ
(i)
d (t), m ∈ {1, 2, · · · ,M}.
If Φ(γm(t)) ≥ m, then the modulation level, m, is a possible
choice. The final modulation level can be determined by
m∗ = argmax
m
{m|Φ(γm(t)) ≥ m} ,
and the participating relay set is denoted as Ωp = Ωm∗ . Note
that, the relays in Ωp absolutely correctly decode the 2m
∗
-
PSK symbol correctly at the current transmission (i.e. Ωd =
Ωp = Ωm∗). This fact will affect the work of modeling in the
following.
5∀ (k1, k2, k3) ∈ {1, 2} × {4, 5, 6} × {K − 1,K}}. Likewise,
we define the transition set, SdTC [w], for w =
1, 2, · · · ,KN+1, as the set of the FSMC states of R(i) − D
links for i = 0, 2, · · · , N in the next time slot when the current
FSMC states of these links are indicated in Sd[w] ∈ Sd. Now
we are ready to derive the transition probability between two
states in the model of modulation mode variation. Let pidealm1,m2
be the transition probability from state m1 to state m2 in two
consecutive time slots, t and t+ 1. Then, we have
pidealm1,m2
= Pr{m2|m1} = Pr{m2,m1}Pr{m1}

Next, we would like to find pideal0,m2 and p

m1,0 . p
ideal
0,m2 is the
transition probability from the cut-off state to state m2 and
pidealm1,0 is the transition probability from state m1 to the cut-off
state. Given that P idealM (m2) =
∑M
m1=0
pidealm1,m2 · P idealM (m1),
pideal0,m2 can be easily obtained by
pideal0,m2 =

The steady state probabilities of all states and the transition
probabilities just derived can fully describe the variation of the
modulation level of the multinode cooperative communication
system when AM is adopted to improve the spectral efficiency.
Next, we would like to model the decoding behavior of a relay
in such a system.
2) Modeling of the DF behavior of the relays: The model
of the DF behavior of each relay is a three states Markov chain,
including good state, bad state, and cut-off state shown in Fig.
3. When a relay is in good state, it means that such a relay
could help forward the source’s information. On the contrary,
the relay would remain silent if it is in bad state. Except those
two states, the cut-off state occurs when no modulation scheme
can be supported by the overall system. Like in the model of
the modulation level variation, we first derive the steady state
probabilities of this model. To begin with, we look at under
what condition a relay would be in the good state. In the ideal
case, a relay is in the good state if this relay is in both Ωd and
Ωp for all modulation levels under all possible combinations
of participating relays. That is,
pi
(i)
G =
M∑
m=1
∑
u∈Λ(i)1
Pr{R(i) ∈ Ωd,R(i) ∈ Ωp,Ωp = Ωum,Ωd = Ωum}
= Zi|a=1,
where Λ(i)a = {u|λ[u, i] = a, u = 1, 2 · · · , 2N}, and
Zi =

∫
γd∈Sd[w]
PM |C2(m)·
fΓd(γd)

·PC2dγd.
Here, P idealM |C2(m) is the conditional probability of the modula-
tion level m under the condition of C2 = {γr ∈ Sr [v] ,γd ∈
Sd [w] ,Ωd = Ω
u
m}. PC2 is the probability of the occurrence
of C2. On the contrary, if R(i) is not in Ωp, we say it is in
the bad state and the associated probability, pi(i)B , is given by
pi
(i)
B =
M∑
m=1
∑
u∈Λ(i)0
Pr{R(i) /∈ Ωd,R(i) /∈ Ωp,Ωp = Ωum,Ωd = Ωum}
= Zi|a=0.
Finally, the probability of the cut-off state, pi(i)C , is equivalent
to P idealM (0).
In what follows, we will derive the transition probabilities,
p
(i)
xy for x, y ∈ {g, b, c}, of R(i), where ‘g’ stands for the
good state, ‘b’ stands for the bad state and ‘c’ means the cut-
off state. For example, when x and y are both g, p(i)gg is the
probability that R(i) is in good state at time t+ 1 giving that
R(i) is in good state at time t. In the following, we will derive
p
(i)

· PC1dγd2dγd1.
We would like to emphasize that since the good state of
R(i) is of concern in the derivation of p(i)gg , only the relay
combinations {λ[u]|λ[u, i] = 1, u = 1, 2, · · · , 2N} are taken
into consideration when deriving p(i)gg . By the same approach,
7scenario, the total power is equal to that used by the case when
there is three relays in the scenario without the total power
constraint. Here we would like to know what the role of the
diversity gain plays. From Fig. 8, the increase in the achievable
data rate is small as the total number of relays increases. This
fact tells us that under the total power constraint, the increase
in the total number of relays benefits the achievable data rate
little. Thus, the diversity gain can help maintain the overall
achievable data rate while keeping the total transmission power
constant. In addition, since the transmission power of each
relay decreases as the total number of relays increases, the
lifetime of the system can be extended.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, a multinode and decode-and-forward coopera-
tive communication system with adaptive modulation scheme
was investigated. The ideal case and its behavior models
were studied. The research of modeling includes two part: the
modeling of the modulation level variation and the modeling
of the DF behavior at each relay. From the final results, the
correctness of the models were confirmed. The simulation
results further verified the benefit of using AM. In addition, the
experiment with total power constraint showed that keeping
the total transmission power of the system will not degrade
the performance. Furthermore, due to the decrease in the
power consumption of nodes, the lifetime of the system can
be extended.
