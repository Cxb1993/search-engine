Abstract 
    An aqueous tape casting of 
gadolinia-doped ceria (GDC) ceramics 
was developed using Poly(acrylic acid) 
PAA as dispersant, Poly(vinyl alcohol) 
PVA as binder, Poly(ethylene glycol) 
PEG as plasticizer, and deionized water 
as solvent. Surface properties of GDC 
powder with and without PAA 
dispersant were characterized by 
electrokinetic measurements. The zeta 
potential measurement revealed that the 
isoelectric point for GDC powders in the 
absence of dispersant corresponds to a 
pH value of 4.06. The experimental 
results showed that pH value greatly 
affects the rheology of the slurry. 
Homogeneous, smooth, and defect-free 
green tapes were successfully obtained 
by using an appropriate slurry formula.

1.  Introduction 
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are 
attracting widespread attention due to 
their high-energy conversion efficiency 
and low pollution. High oxide ionic 
conducting solid electrolytes based on 
zirconia have been intensively 
investigated [1]. In order to reduce the 
operation temperature from 1000 to 
800oC or even lower, doped ceria has 
been considered as the solid electrolyte 
for moderate temperature solid oxide 
fuel cells [2]. In contrast to pure zirconia, 
CeO2-δ has the fluorite structure with 
oxygen vacancies (V..o) as the 
predominant ionic defects. The oxygen 
vacancy concentration and concomitant 
oxide ion conductivity, in CeO2 can be 
increased by the substitution of a 
lower-valent metal such as Y [3], Sm [4, 
5], Gd [6, 7], and Ca [8]. Pure CeO2 
stoichiometric ceramics are a poor oxide 
ion conductors. However, the ion 
conductivity can be improved by 
increasing the oxygen vacancies by the 
 4
molecular weight of (400 g/mol) was 
used as plasticizer. Poly(vinyl alcohol) 
(PVA) with molecular weight of 
(13000-18000 g/mol) was used as binder. 
All organic additives are soluble in 
deionized water. The content of organic 
components in this study was expressed 
in weight percent with respect to the 
GDC powder. 
2.2. Zeta potential measurements 
    The zeta potential of suspension 
was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer 
nano-series. The suspensions were 
prepared by dispersing GDC powders 
(0.01 vol%) in deionized water. The pH 
value of suspension was adjusted by 
adding HNO3 (0.1 M) or NH4OH (1M). 
The suspensions were mixed 
ultrasonically before the test to ensure 
that only the mobility of single particle 
was measured. 
2.3. Rheological characteristic of 
slurry    
Viscosity measurements were at 
room temperature performed using a 
rotary viscometer (BROOKFIELD DV-
Ⅱ+ Pro viscometer). GDC suspensions 
were prepared at solid loadings of 55 
wt% with 2 wt% of PAA for a dispersant 
study.     
2.4. Slurry preparation and tape 
casting 
    The tape cast slurries were prepared 
in two stages. First, GDC powder and 
deionized water with optimum content 
of dispersant were mixed in a 
polyethylene jar with ZrO2 balls for 18 h. 
Next, the binder and plasticizer solution 
were milled for 18 h to obtain good 
homogeneity. Subsequently, the slurry 
was vacuumed to deair. The optimum 
composition of slurry is given in Table 1. 
Tape casting was achieved using a 
laboratory-sale with a moving casting 
head on mylar substrate film. After tape 
casting, the tapes were left to dry at 
room temperature         
2.5. Characterization techniques 
    A computer-interfaced X-ray 
powder diffractometer (XRD) with Cu 
Kα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å) (Model 
Rigaku Multiflex, Tokyo, Japan) was 
used to identify the crystalline phases. 
The morphological features of the green 
tape were observed using a scanning 
electron microscope (SEM; Model 
Hitachi S-3500H, Tokyo, Japan). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Suspension stability 
    Zeta potential measurements were 
performed to identify the optimum pH 
value and dispersant content for GDC 
suspension as shown in Fig. 1. In the 
absence of dispersant, the isoelectric 
point (IEP) was about 4.06. The 
maximum zeta potential (absolute value) 
does not exceed 40 mV in the pH range 
of 2-6, indicating that the electrostatic 
repulsion between GDC particles is 
insufficient for stabilizing suspension in 
the absence of dispersant. For the 
suspension containing 1.0 wt% PAA 
dispersant, the zeta potential (absolute 
value) was about 42 mV at pH=7. 
Therefore, we used a content of 1.0 wt% 
 6
as 2.321 mPa, 1806.57 mPa, and 0.972, 
respectively. GDC slurry exhibited 
pseudoplastic behavior. From 
experimental results, it is concluded that 
the optimum composition of slurry was 
determined as follows, GDC powder 55 
wt%, PAA 1wt%, PVA 5 wt%, PEG 5 
wt%, and deionized water 34 wt%.  
    
3.3. Characteristic of green and 
sintered tapes 
Fig. 4(a) reveals the X-ray 
diffraction patterns of GDC powder after 
calcinations at 600oC. Fig. 4(b) shows 
the X-ray diffraction patterns of the 
GDC sintered tape after sintered at 
1500oC. The figure indicates that GDC 
powder and sintered tape contain only 
the cubic fluorite structure with space 
group Fm3m, no other crystalline phase 
is detected. All the peaks in the pattern 
match well with the Joint Committee of 
Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS) 
card file No. 34-0394. The crystallite 
size (DXRD) of GDC powder was 
calculated according to Scherer equation: 
DXRD = 0.9λ/Bcosθ, which λ is the 
wavelength of the radiation, θ is the 
diffraction angle, and B is the corrected 
half-width of the diffraction peak, given 
by B2 = B2m-B2s, where Bm is the 
measured half-width of the diffraction 
peak and Bs is the half-width of a 
standard CeO2 with a crystal size greater 
than 100 nm. In this study, the reflection 
from (111) plane was used to calculate 
the crystallite size. The result reveals 
that the crystallite size of GDC powder 
is 31.2 nm. The microstructure of the 
green sheet and sintered tape of GDC is 
shown in Fig. 5, revealing top side of the 
green tape displays very smooth surface. 
The homogeneity of the particle packing 
is ascribed to the fact that the GDC 
suspensions were well dispersed. In Fig. 
5(b), it shows good densification, 
well-sintered, with a grain size ranging 
from 2 to 5 μm for sintered tape.  
 
4. Conclusions 
In this study, using PAA as 
dispersant, PVA as binder, PEG as 
plasticizer, and deionized water as 
solvent, flexible and smooth GDC tapes 
have been successfully prepared by tape 
casting process. The isoelectric point for 
GDC powders in the absence of 
dispersant was 4.06. In the presence of 
PAA 1 wt%,  PVA 5 wt%, PEG 5 wt%, 
deionized water 34 wt%, and GDC 
powders 55 wt% exhibited shear 
thinning behavior. This indicated that 
GDC slurry was homogenous and well 
stabilized. The homogenous particle 
packing corresponds to the shear 
thinning behavior of the slurries. Both 
sides of the green tapes revealed smooth 
surfaces. No cracks were detected.
