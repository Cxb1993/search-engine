Table 1 presents the alloy design for this study. Two nominal levels of C and Si were considered— 1.0%C-1.0%Si and
2.0%C-2.0%Si, and two nominal combinations of Ni and Co were evaluated— 35%Ni and 29%Ni+6%Co, for both gray and
ductile irons. The chemical analyses of all heats are presented in Table 2.

ANALYSES OF SOLIDIFICATION TEMPERATURES
The analyses of the solidification cooling curves were conducted by equipping S-type thermocouples at the center of shell
molds, φ40mm x 60 mm L.A typical solidification cooling curve is illustrated in Fig. 1, where the liquidus temperature (the
primary arrest, TL) and the eutectic temperatures (the eutectic arrest) are indicated. Regarding the eutectic arrest temperature,
for the apparatus employed in the present study, one can see that the eutectic reaction occurred at continuing decreasing
temperatures. For the sake of discussion, the beginning and the end of the eutectic reaction are respectively denoted as TE1
and TE2.

RISER DESIGN
In this study, the riser design for the alloys studied, owing to their relatively low C and Si contents, was performed based
upon the concept of cast steel (Chvorinov, 1940, Woldawer, 1966). The Geometric method developed by Heine (Heine, 1963)
was adopted here for the riser design. Following is a brief review of the Geometric method. A complete riser system includes
three sections: (1) the feeding section, (2) the pressure section, and (3) the riser base, as illustrated in Fig. 5. The feeding
section serves as a reservoir that provides liquid metal to compensate for the solidification shrinkage of the casting. The
pressure section is optionally added to ensure the feeding section being above the casting to achieve efficient feeding. While,
the riser base serves as a channel between the feeding section and the casting. For a side-riser, all the three sections are
usually required, whereas, only the feeding section is required for a top-riser.
Fig. 5. A complete riser system for the Geometric method.
Regarding the feeding section, it is further divided to two sub-sections, namely, the outer ring with a shell thickness of w and
the central pipe section with a diameter Dp and a height Hp. The diameter and the height of the feeding section are DR and HP,
respectively, where DR = 2w + Dp. On the other hand, the shell thickness w is equal to 2Mc, where Mc is the casting modulus.
Furthermore, the volume of the pipe, (πDp
2 Hp) / 4, is equal to the amount of the solidification shrinkage of the casting alloy,
namely, (πDp
2 Hp) / 4 = b x Vc , where b is the percent solidification shrinkage and Vc is the casting volume. Based upon the
data of casting volume (Vc), percent solidification shrinkage (b), and casting modulus (Mc), together with the assumption of
Hp = n Dp (n is normally 1 ~3), the dimensions of the feeding section, DR and HP, can be readily obtained.
The experimental setup for evaluating the feeding efficient of various riser sizes is illustrated in Fig. 6, which includes a
pouring basin, an overflow, a riser mold and a primary mold. The molds were made by the CO2 process, and the treatment

The regression analyses were also performed with the prediction equations being denoted in the figures.
It can be noticed that all the above four coefficients of determination are relatively low, implying that the Si alone as the
dependent variable may not be sufficient enough to attain good correlation with the eutectic temperatures. It should be
recognized that the alloys studied herein contain not only Si but also a substantial amount of Ni, and in some cases some
amounts of Co. The role of Ni should not be ignored due to its similarity in metallurgical effect as Si though with different
(less) degree. Therefore, both the effects of Si and Ni are considered and combined into a single parameter, i.e., silicon
equivalent (Si.E.), where Si.E. = %Si + 0.141%Ni + 0.0165(%Si x %Ni). Again, when the relationships between the eutectic
temperature and Si.E were plotted, the results are shown in Fig. 9(a) and Fig. 9(b) for FG irons and SG irons, respectively.
However, the coefficients of determination of the regression equations derived are still relatively low.

ANALYSES OF SOLIDIFICATION AND SOLID SHRINKAGES
A typical example depicting the contour and the sectioned view of a casting is shown in Fig. 10, where the presence of a pipe,
internal porosities and surface sinks are evident. The data for the gross shrinkage (includes both solidification shrinkage and
solid contraction) and solid contraction for all the alloys studied are listed in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. The gross
shrinkage for the 1.0%C-1.0%Si alloys with different Ni and Co combinations are shown in Fig. 11(a) for FG irons and Fig.
11(b) for SG irons. The gross shrinkage is lower for FG irons (7.35% ~ 9.73%) than for SG irons (9.07% ~ 11.17%), with a
difference of some 1.5%. Further, if the solid contraction was excluded and only the solidification shrinkage was considered,
a similar trend was obtained, namely, (2.91% ~ 5.2%) for FG irons and (4.51% ~ 6.48%) for SG irons, and again with a

The gross shrinkage (both solidification shrinkage and solid contraction) for the 2.0%C-2.0%Si alloys with different Ni and
Co combinations are shown in Fig. 13(a) for FG irons and Fig. 13(b) for SG irons. Noting that the differences in gross
shrinkage between FG irons and SG irons are around 0.5% ~0.8%. However, the gross shrinkages remain more or less
unchanged for both FG irons (6.9% ~ 7.3%) and SG irons (7.7% ~ 7.8%) as the Co content increases from 0 to 6% at a
constant NiE. Furthermore, if the solid contraction was excluded and only the solidification shrinkage was considered, a
similar trend was obtained, (1.6% ~ 2.4%) for FG irons and (2.4% ~ 2.9%) for SG irons, with again a difference of 0.5% ~
0.8 %, Fig. 14. It is apparent that less shrinkage for 2.0%C-2.0%Si alloys was obtained when compared with 1.0%C-1.0%Si
alloys.

For 1.0%C-1.0%Si-35%Ni SG irons, the results that are shown in Fig. 17 indicate that the shrinkage porosity can be totally
eliminated only when the riser diameter was raised to 90mm (B16). Fig. 18 illustrates the experimental results for
1.0%C-1.0%Si-29%Ni-6%Co SG irons, where sound castings can be obtained when a riser diameter of 80mm (B25) was
employed. As in LTE FG irons, less risering is required for 1.0%C-1.0%Si-29%Ni-6%Co SG irons than for
1.0%C-1.0%Si-35%Ni SG irons when both results of Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 are compared.

2.0%C-2.0%Si-Ni-Co LTE Cast Irons
Fig. 19 shows the sectional views of castings with various riser sizes for 2.0%C-2.0%Si-35%Ni FG irons. When a
30mm-diameter riser (A31) was used, not only the whole riser was almost consumed, but also the casting exhibited serious
shrinkage porosity at the upper central region of the casting, indicating a substantial under-design of the riser. When the riser
diameter was increased to 60mm (A33), a significant pipe in the riser was observed, which extended into the riser neck and
also the upper central portion of the casting, indicating still an insufficient riser design. Nevertheless, a sound casting was
obtained when the riser diameter was increased to 80mm (A35). For 2.0%C-2.0%Si-29%Ni-6%Co FG irons, similar results
were obtained as in 2.0%C-2.0%Si-35%Ni FG irons, with the optimum riser diameter of being 80mm (Fig. 20).
Table 8 summarizes the optimal ratios of the rise modulus (MR) to the casting modulus (MC) for achieving sound castings for
various alloys, together with the data of percent solidification shrinkage and the optimal riser diameter.

Effects of Insulating Sleeve and/or Exothermic Compounds on Risering
In order to realize the effectiveness of employing insulating sleeves and/or exothermic compounds on risering, Alloys A1, A3,
B1 and B3 were selected for investigation. However, it has to be noted that, due to the size standardization of the
commercially supplied insulating sleeves, only limited variation in sleeve diameter are available. The experimental design is
shown in Table 9.

CONCLUSIONS
(1) The liquidus temperature of the low thermal expansion cast irons is closely correlated with the CE, where CE =
%C+0.33x%Si+0.047x%Ni-0.0055x (%Nix%Si). However, the eutectic temperatures are fairly correlated with the Si
content or SiE value.
(2) The measurements of alloy solidification shrinkage and solid contraction indicate that the percent solidification
shrinkage for FG irons that contain 1.0%C, 1.0%Si and 36%Ni is about 5.2%, while an additional 1.5% should be added
for SG irons of similar compositions. In addition, a 0.35% reduction in solidification shrinkage for each 1% Co
replacement was obtained. Increasing C and Si contents reduces the amount of solidification shrinkage somewhat, and
(1.6% ~ 2.4%) for FG irons and (2.4% ~ 2.9%) for SG irons, with a difference of 0.5% ~ 0.8 %, were obtained. While,
no noticeable change in solidification shrinkage was obtained with substitution of Co for Ni in 2.0%C/2.0%Si irons of
both FG and SG type.
(3) The optimal riser designs for LTE cast irons with various compositions were attained. The experimental results indicate
that the optimal ratios of the riser modulus (MR) to the casting modulus (MC) for achieving sound castings are around
1.27 and 1.43 for FG irons and SG irons, respectively. In addition, the riser requirement is substantially reduced when
insulating sleeves and/or exothermic compounds were employed.

專家學者參加。基本上每一小組研討會由主辦單位邀請 3、4 位專家學者，
以來自工業界為主，針對研討主題，由各種不同技術層面各發表約 15分鐘，
隨後由所有與會者與專家學者進行討論。此類型之研討會大多以實務技術為
主，大家充分溝通，經驗交流，場面非常熱烈，實是一獲益良多的研討方式。
