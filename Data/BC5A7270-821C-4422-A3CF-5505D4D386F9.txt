and are beneath the first-layer metal, they are beyond the
reach of a short-circuit test structure, but can be determined
by forcing the transistor into saturation [23]. By setting the
current flowing out of the collector to be half of the base
current, we slowly increase the base current and voltage, from
1 and 18.8 mV, respectively, to 11 and 95 mV, respectively.
Since this saturated intrinsic transistor can now be modeled
as two conducting diodes, as shown in Fig. 4(a), a Tee circuit
configuration, especially at low frequency, emerges. By extrap-
olating the measured resistance to that corresponding to infinite
base current, we have the frequency-independent , , and
equal to 7.5, 4.1, and 4.3 , respectively, as illustrated in
Fig. 4(b). Here, the solid curves are those corresponding to
2 GHz, and the dashed curves are for 5 GHz. The impacts of
both and on the transistorâ€™s Pi model are ready to be
removed now; , however, will be temporarily retained for
the determination in Section II-B of the substrate network.
B. Determination of Substrate Network
Though mathematically the substrate network can be decided
when the transistor is in saturation, the small in-parallel
renders the derived substrate parameter values highly suscep-
tible to measurement uncertainties. Reliable results can be ob-
tained by reverse-biasing the transistor. With V,
A, V, and A,

the reverse-biased intrinsic transistor resembles two separate ca-
pacitors, as shown in Fig. 5(a). As far as and are con-
cerned, port 1 on the left of the schematic can be connected
to ground and the signal is injected into port 2 on the right. If
is much smaller than the impedance of the series cir-
cuit, then most of the current passing through from port 2
will flow down the branch rather than the branch.
By treating this as open circuit, we then have
, where

Since the complex-number can provide only two
constraints at each frequency point, analytical solutions (of
genuinely frequency independent) for the three parameters
constructing the substrate network cannot be obtained; rather,
numerical algorithms need to be used. As

Least squares fit over the whole frequency range then gives
fF, fF, and , respec-
tively. Fig. 5(b) shows the admittance of the substrate network.
Here, the solid curves are the measured results; the overlapping
dashed curves are their simulated counterparts. Of course, other
similar formulations can also be employed for the derivation of
, , and [9], [10]. If only series [24], or parallel,
circuit is used to model the substrate network, close-form
analytical expressions can indeed be written, but the resulting
parameters will be highly frequency dependent and, thus, are
not useful.
