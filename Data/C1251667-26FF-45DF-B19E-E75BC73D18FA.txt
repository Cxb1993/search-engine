1. Introduction 
Film condensation plays an 
important role in heat exchanger design, 
chemical engineering applications, 
electronic element cooling, and the 
design of power plant cycles. Significant 
efforts have been directed towards 
researches into related fields; such as 
tubes or spheres have received 
considerable attention since the 
pioneering analysis of Nusselt [1]. At 
first, for a natural convection film 
condensation of a quiescent vapor, Dhir 
and Lienhard [2] proposed a general 
integral method, based largely on 
Nusselt’s work to predict heat transfer 
coefficient. Their method is with 
particular reference to the effects of 
non-uniform gravity. Subsequently, 
Yang [3] presented a paper of laminar 
film condensation of a quiescent vapor 
on a sphere based on boundary-layer 
analysis. He considered two cases. The 
first case includes both the inertia forces 
and heat convection, and the second one 
excludes the inertia forces. Dhir [4] 
investigated an experimental study of 
quasi-steady laminar film condensation 
of steam on a copper sphere of three 
different diameters. The data are 
compared with the steady-state 
predictions of Dhir and Lienhard and of 
Yang. The analysis has been made to 
show that it is valid to use steady-state 
solutions in quasi-steady condensation 
as long as the dimensionless thermal 
diffusion time constant is small, and the 
film does not move very slowly.  
  For a forced-convection film 
condensation of flowing vapor on 
axisymmetric bodies, such as a sphere, 
Jacobi [5] developed a generalized 
model by employing the vapor shear 
approximation of Shekriladze and 
Gomelauri [6] and combination of the 
model of Dhir et. al and Rose [7]. And 
then it is applied to a cone at a zero 
angle of attack and a sphere in a uniform 
flow. Next, Hu and Jacobi [8] 
investigated the experiment employed 
flowing CFC 113 vapor, which 
condensed onto a copper sphere. The 
apparatus, procedures, and data 
interpretation are derived from the 
analytical approach.  
                 Although laminar film condensation 
has been widely discussed in published 
literature, it is worthwhile developing an 
understanding of turbulent flow 
condensation. According to Michael et 
al. [9], condensate films may be partially 
turbulent at high vapor velocities. Sarma 
et al. [10] assumed that condensate film 
flow is under turbulent regime in the 
region away from the upper stagnation 
point. He carried out a theoretical 
research into turbulent film 
condensation on a horizontal tube, and 
found that his results were in good 
agreement with experimental data.    
Furthermore, the turbulent film 
condensation on an isothermal sphere 
was also investigated on a later research 
[11]. The results show that under the 
high velocity vapor, turbulent film 
condensation can get better heat transfer

And for the local film shear stress, the 
equation can be expressed as: 
                      
θρρττ sin)( yg vlw −−=         (5)  
Under the high vapor velocity, the 
equation, which describes heat transfer 
in the flow around the sphere surface, 
can be expressed as following equation:                          
3/11 PrRe −= nvv CNu               (6)  
Where C is a constant in flow 
configuration.                              
Colburn suggested that the heat transfer 
factor could be represented as following: 
                          
3/2Pr

Nuf =                  (7)  
  The mean friction coefficient in the 
streamwise direction may then be 
written as:

Furthermore, the local friction can be 
obtained as: 
                         
1Re2 −= nvCfθ                  (9)  
The turbulent boundary layer exerts 
a friction force on the liquid-vapor 
boundary. The shear stress is estimated 
by considering the external flow of 
vapors across the surface of the sphere 
when there is no condensation on that 
surface. The local friction coefficient is 
defined as:

According to potential flow theory, for a 
uniform vapor flow of velocity ∞u  
passing a spherical surface, the vapor 
velocity at the edge of the boundary is 
given by:

Incorporating the interfacial vapor shear 
stress δτ  given by Eq. (12) into the 
elemental force balance enables Eq. (4) 
to be rewritten in the following

The eddy diffusivity for momentum mε

Integration of this expression over the

The equations developed above will now

this paper, which relates to a numerical 
method. The numerical program is 
obtained by using Visual C++ 6.0. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 2 presents the variation of the 
dimensionless film thickness of the 
condensate around the circumference of 
the sphere under the different values of 
wall temperature amplitude, A=0.2, 0.5 
and 0.8. Besides, the figure shows the 
influence of shear stress 
wτ
τ . Firstly, we 
discussed how the temperature 
amplitude influenced the film thickness. 
The decrease of the temperature 
amplitude will lead to a higher 
temperature difference, i.e. )( ws TT −  is 
larger. A higher temperature difference 
will bring out a higher condensation rate 
and the increases of the film thickness. 
Next, we discussed the influence of 
wττ /  on the film thickness. As the 
figure shows that the film thickness 
under the shear stress model of 
θτ
τ sin1 3*R
y
w
+
−=  is higher than the 
model of 1=
wτ
τ . That is because under 
the shear stress of model 
θτ
τ sin1 3*R
y
w
+
−= , the dimensionless 
film velocity will decrease and the film 
thickness will increase for satisfying the 
equation of flow rate balance.  
Fig. 3 presents the variation of the 
local Nusselt number of the condensate 
around the circumference of the sphere. 
The figure considers three different 
Froude numbers under two different 
temperature amplitudes (A=0.2, A=0.8). 
Under the nearly free convection 
condensation (Fr=50), the Nusselt 
number is seldom influenced by the 
vapor velocity. As the vapor velocity 
increases, the local Nusselt number 
increases gradually from upper 
stagnation °= 0θ  to °= 90θ . From 
°= 90θ  to °= 180θ , the Nusselt 
decreases gradually. The phenomenon 
shows that under the high vapor velocity 
of forced convection turbulent film 
condensation, the influence of the vapor 
velocity on the Nusselt number is 
similar to a trend of potential flow. And 
under the high velocity vapor, the 
Nusselt number of the turbulent 
condensate film increases as the vapor 
velocity increases.   
Fig. 4 provides a comparison 
between the present results for the 
mean Nusselt number on a sphere and 
those generated in previous studies.
