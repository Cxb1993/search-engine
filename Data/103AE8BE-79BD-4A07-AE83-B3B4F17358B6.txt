abilities of the implanted species inside the implantedmaterial.
The thermal stresses due to the temperature gradient inside the
implanted material can reduce the lifetime and quality of the
implanted material. Li et al [16] presented the microstructure
evolution versus the implantation temperature for nitrogen
implanted in austenitic stainless steel. It was found that the
implantation temperature strongly affects the evolution of the
microstructure and plays a decisive role in the whole process.
For instance, an amorphous layer up to 3µm thick was formed
on the implanted surface at 450 ◦C, and at 520 ◦C cellular
precipitation of chromium nitride and ferrite dominated the
microstructure. Nitrogen ions were implanted into low carbon
steel under various pulse bias voltages and nitrogen pressure;
this process was investigated experimentally by Mitsuo et al
[17]. Experimental results showed that the temperature of the
substrate rises proportionally to the pulse bias voltage and that
the region affected by nitrogen becomes deeper with higher
bias voltage and higher nitrogen pressure. Precise control of
the substrate temperature is extremely important in PIII of
semiconductors [18]. Many methods and models have been
proposed for the measurement and prediction of the substrate
temperature in the plasma [19–24]. Yeh [24] proposes a
semi-analytical model by using the two-dimensional Laplace
integral transform technique to calculate the temperature
evolutions and the melting times of the front surface of a slab
and a semi-inﬁnite target with repetitive negative bias voltage
pulses in contact with a plasma. The results show that the
temperatures and heating rates of the front surface of the slab
and target increase with the pulse parameters. The melting
times needed to initiate the melting at the front surface are
strongly dependent on the pulse parameters and are reduced
with increasing pulse parameters. The heat ﬂux transport from
the plasma to the workpiece during the pulse-off duration is an
important factor to increase the temperature of the workpiece
for low pulse duty cycle and bias voltage. The temperature
of the workpiece is underestimated when not accounting for
the heating effects during the pulse-off duration for low pulse
parameters. However, the temperature gradient distribution
inside the workpiece is not discussed in this work.
The aim of the present work is to investigate the plasma
heating of a ﬁlm on a substrate subject to repetitive high
negative bias voltage pulses during PIII by using the Laplace
integral transform method. Based on a previously published
analysis [25], the ﬁlm experiences heating induced by energy
ﬂux coming from a bulk plasma through the presheath and
sheath to the surface. In this study, a one-dimensional
unsteady heat conductionmodel is developed to systematically
predict the unsteady temperature and the temperature gradient
distributions in the ﬁlm and substrate. Using this model,
the effects of the implantation voltage, pulse-on duration and
pulse frequency on the temperature and temperature gradient
inside the ﬁlm and substrate can be determined. The rise of
the ﬁlm temperature due to ﬂoating voltage during the pulse-
off duration is also considered. This work enables process
engineers to predict the target temperature and the temperature
gradient for a wide variety of implant materials and processing
parameters.

2. Analytical model
In this study, a ﬁlm of ﬁnite thickness s on a semi-inﬁnite
substrate at room temperature T0 was subjected to energy
transport fromplasma, as illustrated inﬁgure 1(a). The plasma,
comprising the bulk plasma, presheath and sheath, is in contact
with an electrically negative bias wall partially reﬂecting or
secondarily emitting ions and electrons. When a series of high
bias voltage pulse is applied to the ﬁlm, high energies of the
ions perpendicularly to the front surface of the ﬁlm increase the
temperatures of the ﬁlm and substrate. The incident heat ﬂux
will be conducted through the thickness of the ﬁlm and through
the interface into the substrate. The major assumptions made
are as follows [4, 5, 24, 25].
1. The model is one-dimensional due to a thin thickness of
the region considered.
2. The transport processes in the plasma in contact with the
surface can be modelled as those in the plasma between
two parallel plates.
3. The presheath and sheath are imposed by a negligible
magnetic ﬁeld or a magnetic ﬁeld in a direction parallel
to the ion ﬂow. As a result, the one-dimensional ion ﬂow
can be assured.
4. The presheath and sheath are collisionless. This is valid
for sufﬁciently low pressures.
5. The ionization rate is determined from the model by
Emmert et al [26].

Equations (35) and (36) are also used to evaluate
the temperature gradients inside the ﬁlm and substrate,
respectively. Thermal analysis of the substrate can be avoided
if the contact Biot number Bic = hcs/kf , where hc denotes
the contact heat transfer coefﬁcient, is introduced. Heat ﬂux
at the bottom surface of the ﬁlm therefore can be evaluated by
− ∂λf(1, τ )
∂ξ
= Bicλf(1, τ ). (37)
The contact Biot number Bic is obtained by substituting
equations (33) and (35) for ξ = 1 into equation (37).
The variation of temperature with time in the ﬁlm on the
substrate therefore can be calculated by solely solving the heat
conduction equation of the ﬁlm using the contact Biot number.
The relationship between the heat ﬂux at the interface between
the ﬁlm and the substrate and that at the bottom surface of a slab
is of interest. The artiﬁcial Biot number, Bia = has/kf , where
ha denotes an artiﬁcal heat transfer coefﬁcient between the ﬁlm
and substrate, is introduced to simulate the Biot number of a
slab, Bi = hs/kf , where h denotes a heat transfer coefﬁcient
at the bottom surface of a slab. The heat conduction ﬂux at the
bottom surface of a slab is equal to that at the interface between
the ﬁlm and the substrate.
Biλslab(1, τ ) = Biaλf(1, τ ). (38)

3. Results and discussion
To conﬁrm relevancy and accuracy of thismodel, a comparison
between the predicted and measured surface temperatures
as a function of time [18] for hydrogen plasma and silicon
ﬁlm is shown in ﬁgure 2. The reference data for the
comparison are listed in table 1. The predicted dimensional
temperature as a function of dimensional time agrees quite
well with experimental data [18]. A closed form solution for
the temperature distribution of a ﬁlm on the substrate with
repetitive high negative bias voltage pulses due to plasma
heating is obtained. To reduce the closed form solution
obtained from the present study to the solution obtained
in the previous work [27], the effects of repetitive high
negative bias voltage pulses in equations (33) and (34) are
neglected. Consequently, the analytical solution obtained for
the temperature distribution becomes identical to the solution
obtained in the previous work [27] for a case without repetitive
high negative bias voltage pulses. The temperature proﬁles

inside the ﬁlm and substrate are computed for different pulse
parameters and thermophysical properties of the ﬁlm and
substrate. The dimensionless parameters employed in the
computation in ﬁgures 3–9 are given in table 2.
Figure 3(a) shows the dimensionless temperature proﬁles
inside the ﬁlm and substrate when the dimensionless time is
variable. In this case, the decay of the temperature proﬁle in the
surface vicinity slowsmore than the one corresponding to some
depth below the surface. This can also be seen in ﬁgure 3(b),
in which the temperature gradient (∂λ/∂ξ) is shown. Here,
the temperature gradient attains a minimum at a certain depth
below the surface. The internal energy gain increases in the
surface region of the ﬁlmdue to absorption of irradiated plasma
energy, and the diffusion energy transport from the surface
vicinity to the ﬁlm bulk is not as high as the internal energy
gain. Consequently, this gives rise to low temperature gradient

ﬁgure 4(a), are shown in ﬁgure 4(b). The magnitudes of the
temperature gradient inside the ﬁlm for a low substrate-to-ﬁlm
solid thermal conductivity ratio and a high ﬁlm-to-substrate
speciﬁc heat ratio are lower than those of the solid line case.
This indicates that the cooling effect of the substrate on the
ﬁlm is small. Increasing the pulse duty cycle and bias voltage
results in increasing the magnitude of the temperature gradient
inside the ﬁlm and the difference of the temperature gradients
of the ﬁlm and the substrate at the interface. It should be
noted that the dashed–double-dotted line (Ksf = 1) shows that
the temperature gradient at the bottom surface of the ﬁlm is
identical to the one at the front surface of the substrate.
The dimensionless temperature evolutions at different
depths inside the ﬁlm are shown in ﬁgure 5(a). The solid
and dashed–dotted lines represent the front surfaces ξ = 0
and ξ = 0.05 inside the ﬁlm, respectively. It can be
seen that as the incident plasma energy progresses, the front
surface temperature rises periodically. The periodicity of
the temperature evolution at ξ = 0.05 is identical to the
one at ξ = 0, but the difference in peak to valley of the

temperature evolution per period at ξ = 0.05 is smaller than
that at ξ = 0. The dashed–double-dotted and the dashed
lines represent the temperature evolution at ξ = 0.1 and
ξ = 0.2, respectively. The periodic temperature evolution
in the former is slightly visible but cannot be observed easily
in the latter. The periodicity of the temperature evolution at
ξ = 1 disappears. In other words, as the depth from the surface
increases further, the temperature evolution shows either an
increasing trend or an oscillation of a small magnitude. At
a certain depth, the oscillation of the temperature evolutions
disappears. Figure 5(b) shows the temporal variation of the
heat ﬂux at different depths inside the ﬁlm. Similar to the
temperature evolutions in ﬁgure 5(a), the heat ﬂux evolutions
in the vicinity of the front surface inside the ﬁlm also oscillate.
As the distance from the front surface increases, the mean heat
ﬂux and the difference in peak to valley of the temperature
evolutions are both reduced. The mean heat ﬂux has a
maximum in the vicinity of the surface. The periodicity of the
heat ﬂux evolution disappears at ξ = 1. The heat ﬂux evolution
also represents the temperature gradient evolution inside the

surfaces of the ﬁlm increase about 5.47 and 5.67 times,
respectively, as shown in ﬁgure 7(b). Figures 7(a) and 7(b)
indicate that the temperature at the front and bottom surfaces
of the ﬁlm vary linearly with the pulse parameters.
The contact Biot number versus the dimensionless time
affected by the pulse parameters is presented in ﬁgure 8.
The solid line shows the predicted results based on the
dimensionless reference parameters from table 2. The cooling
effect of the substrate on the ﬁlm is higher at the initial time,
since the substrate temperature is at the ambient temperature.
The contact Biot number rapidly drops at the initial time
and is then monotonically reduced. The latter is a result of
the substrate temperature rising and the heat conduction ﬂux
between the ﬁlm and substrate being reduced. The plasma
energy transport to the ﬁlm surface increases with the pulse
parameters; hence, the temperature and heat ﬂux at the bottom
surface of the ﬁlm both increase. However, the contact Biot
number is independent of the pulse duty cycle and bias voltage.
The artiﬁcial Biot numbers versus the dimensionless time for
Bi = 5 × 10−3 affected by pulse parameters are shown in
ﬁgure 9. The solid line is calculated based on table 2. It
can be seen that the artiﬁcial Biot number rises monotonically
from 1.1 × 10−2 to 2.1 × 10−2 for τ = 0.3–10. Because the
temperature at the bottom surface of the slab is larger than it
is in the ﬁlm, the artiﬁcial Biot number is larger than the Biot
number, Bi = 5 × 10−3, to enhance the heat conduction ﬂux
between the ﬁlm and substrate at this dimensionless time. The
temperature at the bottom surface of the ﬁlm and the slab both
increasewith the pulse parameters. However, the artiﬁcial Biot
number is independent of pulse duty cycle and bias voltage.
4. Conclusions
1. Plasma heating of workpieces is important for plasma
processing. The evolution of the microstructure of the
implanted material in PIII is deeply affected by the
implant temperature, which can be controlled by choosing
appropriate pulse duty cycles and bias voltages. The
closed form solution for the temperature distribution
inside the ﬁlm and substrate with repetitive high negative
bias voltage pulses due to plasma heating is obtained
by using a Laplace transform method. The closed form
solution derived from the present study can be reduced to
a previously obtained analytical solution when the effects
of repetitive high negative bias voltage pulses are omitted
in the closed form solution, i.e. it can be reduced to the
solution obtained for a workpiece in a ﬂoating voltage
case. The effects of pulse parameters on the temperature
and temperature gradient distributions inside the ﬁlm are
found to be signiﬁcant. The predicted surface temperature
of the ﬁlm on the substrate as a function of time agrees
well with the experimental data. The results can be used to
control the temperature evolution in the ﬁlm by choosing
appropriate process parameters.
2. Temperature and temperature gradient of the ﬁlm increase
with increasing pulse duty cycle and bias voltage. There
exists a minimum in the temperature gradient proﬁle at
a certain depth below the surface. As the heating period
progresses, the point of the minimum in the temperature
gradient moves towards the solid bulk of the ﬁlm. The
temperature evolution rises periodically and the heat ﬂux
evolution oscillates near the vicinity of the surface of
the ﬁlm. In the region beyond this depth, the above-
mentioned phenomena disappear and the temperature and
temperature gradient evolutions rise monotonically. The
variations of the pulse parameters have no inﬂuence on
the contact and artiﬁcial Biot numbers.
