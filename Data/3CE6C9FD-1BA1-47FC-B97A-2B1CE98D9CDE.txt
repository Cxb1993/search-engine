1.      Introduction 
 
     In 1980 era, Taiwan started blooming on manufacturing sector and export oriented 
industries. The success of quality and productivity improvement on “MIT” (Made in 
Taiwan) products since then built up a strong foundation on economic and living standard 
growth for Taiwan. Around two decades ago, Taiwan also started facing huge challenges 
from China and other developing countries on manufacturing capability and South Korea 
and other developed countries on technology innovation. To break through the current 
hardship on Taiwan's industrial competition power, Taiwan needs to be successful in 
transition from a role of assembly house (OEM, the Original Equipment Manufacturer) 
and design agent (ODM, the Original Design Manufacturer) to a world-class design and 
manufacturing center for its own brand of high technology products.  With these 
capabilities, Taiwan will create its next economy golden era. 
 
     To assure a successful transition for from MIT to DIT (Design in Taiwan) for 
Electronic Industries of Taiwan, many of DFX technologies play a critical role for design 
capability improvement. DFX is a technology for building product functions and service 
capabilities into design during product development phase.  Elements of DFX include 
“Design for Reliability”, “Design for Quality”, “Design for Testing”, “Design for 
Serviceability”, “Design for Maintainability” etc..  It is proved by many “Best-in-Class” 
companies in the world that applying DFX technologies can achieve desired product 
functions and capabilities with low cost and short design cycle time. 
  
     Like health to our body, reliability is something that is hard to make copy to a product 
without building the strength from its birth. The best way to make a durable product is to 
design reliability before the product is created. This research is focused on how to build 
reliability in product development phase. 
 
     Design for reliability (DFR) is a process that defines work functions among marketing, 
design, reliability and quality, supply chain and other operation departments toward 
building product reliability in design phase by applying principles for reliable product 
design, evaluating engineering specifications and adapting lessons learned from field 
failures to accomplish customer desired reliability level. 
 
     DFR process offers a series of proactive actions on how to define a market winning 
reliability target,  allocation of reliability target, prediction of reliability at early design 
phase by reliability modeling, critical components selection and qualification, derating 
review on electrical stress, thermal stress review, design EST (Environmental Stress Tests) 
for design verification, warranty and spares planning, integrated hardware and software 
reliability modeling for interface design and design optimization, etc.

      In 2006, Telcordia Technologies published the SR-332, Issue 2 document, "Reliability 
Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment" and some institutes and corporations also 
have significant contribution in providing updated failure rate data base for electronic and 
photo-electron devices.  
 
     Although some reliability experts have critiques on the adequacy and accuracy of the 
black-box oriented parts-count method for system reliability prediction, the method is 
still considered as an appropriate approach by many reliability prediction practitioners in 
industries. One of the main reasons for adopting the parts-count based reliability 
prediction methods is its flexibility in improving prediction accuracy on components 
failure rates through the use of test data from in-plant reliability tests and field reliability 
tests. Also, the method has been proved by many companies to be effective on providing 
assessment and comparison of product reliability in design phase for alternative designs 
internally from a company or competitive products from external sources. However, it is 
a fact that the inherent weakness of the parts-count based system reliability prediction 
method is its prediction accuracy. It is important for the users of this method to keep in 
mind on the weakness of the method and to deploy the method on its intended reliability 
assessment applications. 
 
 
Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) 
 
     Around year 2000, Prognostics and Health Management technology emerged as a 
effective tool for reliability prediction based on product's life cycle profile and some 
damaging levels and/or failure precursors observed on the product. The technology is 
developed by Dr. Michael Pecht and his research team in the University of Maryland, 
USA at the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE). 
 
     PHM has played as the new paradigm for the reliability, maintenance, and logistics 
community. According to the introduction of the technology by CALCE, prognostics is 
the process of predicting a product’s remaining useful life for product’s expected future 
use by assessing the degradation or deviation of current health from expected state of 
health. PHM enables users, maintainers, and manufacturers to dynamically understand 
the state of health of a system or product and thereby helps them make informed and 
timely life cycle management decisions.  
 
     Benefits of PHM are expected from providing advance warning of failures, 
minimizing unscheduled maintenance, extending maintenance cycles, facilitating timely 
repair actions, reducing life cycle costs, reducing downtime, reducing inventory, 
improving design and qualification, and improving logistical support of fielded and future 
systems. 
 
     There are many different methodologies that can be used to conduct PHM, but each of 
these falls into two main categories:  the physics of failure (PoF) approach and the data 
driven approach. The physics of failure based prognostics approach utilizes knowledge of 
  
5 
   Banjevic (2008) gave detailed study on remaining useful life from the mathematical 
view point. Various probability distribution functions are used as examples to explain 
characteristics and applications on the remaining useful life. The importance of 
combining conditional status and remaining useful life in industry was also pointed out in 
the study. 
 
      Kamathi et al. (2009) studied hard disk drive reliability through long term testing and 
monitoring with application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.  
 
 
    
4.  DFR and PHM Methodologies 
 
 
4.1  A Prognostics Based DFR Process 
 
      The DFR process is designed to ensure that reliability requirements can be built 
during product design phase for satisfying the product reliability objectives with low 
development cost, low failure cost and short design cycle time. The DFR process 
framework is based on reliability management system.  The key concept for the 
management system can be explained in the following six-steps procedure shown in Fig. 
1. It starts from the identification of reliability requirements based on marketing and 
competitors research. The second and third step is to design the product functionalities 
with analysis on its reliability capability down to component level. The fourth step is to 
verify of system reliability during schematic stage for comparison with reliability 
objectives. Then, the process followed by validation on reliability requirements and 
objectives using real product units. The last step is a feedback function for providing 
lessons learned from internal and external reliability issues to design guidelines updating 
and improvement on next generation design.

        The study on failure precursor and damaging level modeling provides information 
on reliability prediction based on damaging level. The experimental results can be used to 
support reliability prediction based on PHM in the next development phase. 
 
        The third gate, G3, is a decision gate for "Proceed to Volume Production".  In this 
development phase, production process capability is conducted to assure the conformance 
to product design specifications with minimum variations. This is a foundation for stable 
reliability performance and reliability prediction accuracy. The production EST and ALT 
along with PHM based RUL (Remaining Useful Life) provides multi-sources system 
reliability prediction for better accuracy of reliability prediction on field performance. 
 
         The last gate in the DFR process, G4 is a decision gate for "Launch for General 
Availability". It is the go or no-go signal for introducing the new product to the market 
and end customers. Field reliability monitor procedure and PHM based RUL prediction 
can support on field reliability prediction with large sample size basis. This advantage of 
sample size provides opportunities on diagnosis on key field reliability issue at early 
marketing introduction stage. Product recall, supplier reliability corrective action and 
design modification can be taken to prevent the escaped reliability issues to become 
uncontrollable. In this phase, we should also take the field reliability lessons learned for 
modification of component derating guidelines, product operational profile and other 
design guidelines for improving design quality in next generations of product. 
 
 
4.2  Remaining Useful Life Estimate 
         
      Time-To-Failure-Precursor of a product can be analyzed for fitting some probability 
distribution. We define conditional probability as the probability of a product for 
successful operating t hours with no failure precursor detected after passing PHM check 
for the precursor at time T0.  The general form of conditional reliability can be expressed 
as,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
      Furthermore, the first derivative of the conditional reliability shows that the 
conditional reliability is a decreasing function of T0 , if the failure rate is an increasing 
function. Similarly, if the failure rate is a decreasing function, the conditional reliability 
will be an increasing function of T0 . [Ebeling, 2010] 
   
 
 
      The residual MTTF denoted as MTTF(T0), can be defined as Mean-Time-To-Failure-
Precursor after passing PHM check on failure precursor at time T0 . It can be derived 
from the conditional reliability function in Eq (1). Calculation on residual MTTF is

owner to take action when failure precursor was detected by PHM check on the failure 
precursor. The actions may include preventive maintenance for extending product life or 
ordering a replacement unit to avoid unexpected failure and high cost associated with it. 
  
  
5.  Case Studies 
 
Case Study 1: 
 
        A cable telecommunication network reliability configuration is established in 
Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) in Fig. 4. The network is a repairable system. System 
availability and system downtime are key figures of merit for the network. The objective 
is to study the system availability and downtime for the network in the design stage for 
evaluating network's capability to meet the company's five-nine system availability target.

                     Fig. 4  RBD for a Cable Telecommunication Network 
 
      For each printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) shown as a block in the RBD, the 
failure rate is estimated during the design stage by parts count method or from past field 
history of similar products. To be objective, the parts count method is applied. Keys on 
the parts count method are (1) selection of appropriate component failure rate estimation 
standard such as Telcordia SR-332 document or other corporate prediction standard, (2) 
perform the derating analysis on component's environmental and operating stresses based 
on design schematic, bill of material and company's derating guidelines and (3) correct 
specification of parts that fail to meet derating guideline and estimate failure rate of parts 
based on its actual or calculated environmental and operating stresses. 
 
      The reliability models for each sub-systems are developed according to their 
reliability configurations.  
 
Sub-system A is a simplex system with failure rate of 8124 FITs and mean restoration 
  
15 
      With calculations from the six sub-systems, overall system availability can be 
obtained: 
           
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analysis and system availability improvement: 
 
      A four-nine system availability (0.999,98) is predicted for the cable 
telecommunication system with the identified reliability configuration and estimated sub-
system parameters. Sensitivity analyses for the system are conducted for reaching a five-
nine availability system or higher level. The improvement approaches should consider the 
engineering and economic constraints. Examples for the improvement approaches are 
reducing sub-system failure rates, increasing restoration rates, increasing fault detection 
rate, etc. Table 2 shows the impact of sub-system restoration rate from the default of 2 
hours with improvement to 1 hour. The system downtime can be improved from 10.2 
mpy to 5.21 mpy accordingly. As a result, system availability can be improved from 4-
nine system to 5-nine system. Details of analysis on Case Study 1 can be found in Wen 
(2013) thesis which is a dedicated research to support this NSC research project.

      Assume that a drive has been scan tested by the SMART program at time T0 of 0 hour 
(new product), 2190 hours (after 3 months use), 4380 hours (after 6 months use) and 
8760 hours (after one year use) respectively,  the residual MTTF can be calculated using 
Eq.(9) where the value of  MTTF can be found from Eq. (8) and Γ((1/β)+1) is a Gamma 
function . 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
      As expected from Eq. (2) that R(To+t|T0) is a decreasing function w.r.t. T0 , if λ(T) is 
a increasing function, the MTTF(T0) from above calculations shows that it is also a 
decreasing function of T0 , since β > 1, an indication of increasing failure rate in Weibull 
distribution.

precursor. The shorter period of MTTF2 provides product owner an action window for 
taking necessary preventive actions from the impact of real failure. 
 
 
C.) Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on PHM monitoring result 
 
      With the result from A.), it is feasible to predict that the drive has RUL of MTTF(T0) 
after PHM monitoring at time T0 with no failure precursor (scan error) found.  If the 
drives under study from the teaching lab. has field return data and reliability test results 
for units with scan error, similar analysis can be performed as B.) in this section. The 
MTTF2 for real drive failure given units with scan error is expected to be much smaller 
than the MTTF1 for regular drive with no failure precursor (scan error). The MTTF2 can 
be regarded as an action window for taking necessary remedies to prevent impact of 
unexpected real failure caused by the drive. Figure 6 shows the relation for PHM 
monitoring at product age of (1) Start operation, (2) 3 months and (3) 6 months. It shows 
that the expected time for scan error occurrence is decreasing as the PHM monitoring 
time is increased (product age increased). The average time that a real HDD failure will 
occur after the scan error happened is MTTF2 . According to the study from Pinheiro et al. 
(2007), the drive unreliability is independent of number of scan errors in a drive. That 
implies the MTTF2  is independent of the time that a scan error detected in a drive. From 
the identification of scan error to the real drive failure, this time gap provides a valuable 
chance for product owner to take preventive action for the impact of  a real failure.
