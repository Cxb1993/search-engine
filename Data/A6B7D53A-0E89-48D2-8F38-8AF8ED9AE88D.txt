摘 要
地球永續發展已成為全球關注的課題，而永續、生態及綠建築的概念亦隨之成為關心環境保育
國家所重視的議題。隨著近年來許多環境和醫學之相關研究學者發表有關室內空氣與揮發性有機化
合物(VOCs)的關聯性研究成果，世界衛生組織(WHO)及諸多歐美先進國家皆已注意到室內空氣污染物
所造成之健康危害，其中又以一般裝修行為所引致之 VOCs 之逸散備受重視，亦紛紛制定了其對於人體
健康危害之濃度標準，以供環境安全檢測及其對人體健康影響之判定。其中又以常見於裝修導致逸散
之甲醛與苯類氣體等許多特定 VOCs 已被證實會對人體造成相當程度之健康危害(IARC:國際癌症
研究署)，隨著時代的進步，揮發性有機化合物氣體偵測技術在近年來已廣泛地應用於各種環境偵
測及勞工安全維護等相關領域，但往往因為技術的限制，現場採樣後的樣品必須送回實驗室以大型儀
器設備(如:氣相層析儀-GC)進行採樣氣體的判定及濃度之比對。無法對VOCs進行現場濃度的即時(real
time)判定 ，而使得現場人員身現於危險濃度之下而不自知，許多無法查明原因之癌症往往都是因此而
產生。本計畫已於第一年利用微機電技術，並整合電訊量測系統，製作出可針對揮發性有機化合物
(VOCs)–苯類氣體進行偵測之可攜式微型感測器。一種建立於石英玻璃基材的微型感測器於本研究
中製作完成，並進行測試，已得到良好之苯類氣體感測性能。

Abstract
As science and technology developed, the techniques for VOCs monitoring were generally applied
on environmental monitoring and labor safety maintenance. Nevertheless, the sample should be delivered
to the bench-top instrument for concentration analysis, like gas chromatography (G.C.). A “real-time”
analyzing is infeasible. Site workers always stayed in an environment containing over-limit VOCs and
were not conscious of the danger. Therefore, many indefinite cancers were led. The project applied
MEMS technology integrated with an electrical measurement system, a portable VOCs–Benzene sensor
has been developed. The type of benzene sensors based on quartz silicon substrate were fabricated and
tested in the project. Good experimental results were collected and analyzed in the following report.

device was found to be enhanced at a working
temperature of 300oC. O3 gas sensors have been
successfully developed by printing WO3 porous
layers directly onto impermeable substrates [20] or
by using a RF reactive magnetron sputtering
technique [21].
This study employs a straightforward MEMS-based
fabrication process to realize a benzene sensor featuring a
quartz substrate, a sputtered WO3 layer with a micron-scale
grain size, an integrated Pt micro-hotplate and Pt
interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). It is found that the
sensitivity of the gas sensor is optimized at a working
temperature of 300oC. At the optimal working temperature,
the experimental results show that the sensor has a high
degree of sensitivity (0.041 % ppm-1), a rapid response
time (40 s), and a quick recovery time (240 s).
II. SENSOR DESIGN
Micro-Hotplate
The sensor developed in this study operates on
the principle that changes in the coverage of the
adsorbed or chemisorbed gas species on the sensing
film cause a detectable change in the electrical
conductance of the film. Gas sensing devices are
typically designed to operate at elevated temperatures
in order to activate the reactions which produce the
sensor response and to reduce humidity effects [22].
However, a drawback of such devices is that the
observed response may actually be the result of the
presence of more than one gas in the atmosphere.
Therefore, to enhance the “selectivity” of a device, 
its operating temperature must be optimized in order
to reduce the effects of competing reactions. In the
present study, a Pt micro-hotplate is fabricated on the
sensing layer [23]. When a voltage is applied to this
hotplate, its temperature increases, generating a
simultaneous heating effect in the sensing layer
immediately below it. The optimal operating
temperature for the sensor is determined by varying
the temperature of the hotplate, i.e. by varying the
applied voltage, and comparing the detection
sensitivities at different temperatures.
Design
As shown in Figure 1, the benzene sensor
developed in this study comprises a quartz (Can the
label in the figure be changed from “glass” to
“quartz”to be consistent?) substrate, a WO3 sensing
layer, a Pt micro-hotplate, and Pt IDEs. The
micro-hotplate provides an instantaneous and precise
temperature control capability, while the IDEs
facilitate the direct electrical measurement of the
change in conductivity of the sensing layer induced
by the presence of benzene in the atmosphere. The
grain size of the sputtered WO3 sensing layer is very
small, and therefore both the sensitivity and the
response time of the device are enhanced due to the
increased contact area between the catalyst grains
and the sensed gas.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The diffraction pattern of the WO3 sensing layer
was observed using an XRD measurement system
(XRD-600 LabX, Shimadzu, Japan). The heating
performance of the micro-hotplate was investigated
using an IR thermometer (PT-3LF, OPTEX, Japan).
The sensing performance of the device was
characterized in a test chamber by using an LCR
meter (4230 LCR, Wayne Kerr Electronics, Taiwan)
to record the signal response generated by changes in
the benzene concentration over the range 0 to 1400
ppm.
A. Diffraction pattern of WO3 thin-film layer
Figure 6 shows the diffraction pattern of a WO3
thin-film sample deposited at a sputtering
temperature of 25oC. In general, when a thin film is
to be used as a sensing layer, it is desirable that the
film has a non-random orientation. In Figure 6, it is
apparent that the specified sputtering annealing
conditions result in a WO3 film with good
crystallinity and a pronounced (002) preferred
orientation.
B.Effect of applied power on micro-hotplate
temperature
Figure 7 presents the variation of the
micro-hotplate temperature with the applied power. It
can be seen that the temperature increases linearly
with increasing power at a rate of approximately
54oC/W.

temperatures of 250oC, 300oC and 350oC,
respectively.
E. Repeatability
Figure 11 presents the repeatability results
obtained by repeatedly increasing the concentration
from 0 to 200 ppm, maintaining this concentration
for a period, and then reducing to 0. The results
indicate that the benzene gas sensor has a recovery
time of 120 s, 240 s and 90 s at working temperatures
of 250oC, 300oC and 350oC, respectively. The
recovery time reduces as the sensing layer
temperature increases to be 350oC due to the offered
thermal and kinetic energy for returning the chemical
reactions within the sensing layer at the temperature
for recovery characteristics.

V. CONCLUSIONS
This study has demonstrated a novel
MEMS-based benzene gas sensor featuring a thin
WO3 sensing layer. The WO3 film is deposited on a
quartz substrate and a Pt micro-hotplate is then
deposited directly on the sensing layer. Finally, Pt
IDEs are deposited on the sensing layer to measure
the change in conductivity caused by benzene
oxidation on the WO3 surface. The integrated
