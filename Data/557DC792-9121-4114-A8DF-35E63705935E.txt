minimization problem to be 
NP-complete under certain one-side and 
two-side labeling schemes. 
Subsequently, approximation algorithms 
are derived for the above intractable 
problems. We also present an O (n2 log3 
n)-time algorithm for the problem of 
minimizing the total leader length for 
multi-site-to-one-label boundary 
labeling, where n is the number of labels.

三、問題定義與研究結果 
A k-side type-t many-to-one boundary 
labelled map (or k-side type-t map, for 
short), where k ∈ {1, 2, 4} and t ∈ {opo, 
po, s}, is M = (P, L, n1, n2, n3, n4, f) 
where 
z P = {p1, p2, ..., pN}, pi ∈ R2, 1 ≤ i  
≤ N, is the set of sites (points) on 
the plane enclosed in a rectangle, 
z L is the set of labels with |L| = n1 + 
n2 + n3 + n4, 
z n1, n2, n3, n4 ∈ N are the numbers of 
labels to the East, West, South, and 
North, respectively, of the 
axis-parallel rectangle  enclosing 
all sites in P, 
z f: P  → L is an onto function which 
assigns each site in P to a label in L. 
Note that f is a many-one function 
in general. 
W.l.o.g., we assume that for k = 1 (resp., 
2), labels are only placed on the east side 
(resp., east and west sides) of the 
enclosing rectangle of P. Hence, n2 + n3 
+ n4 = 0 for k =1 and n3 + n4 = 0 for k = 
2. On the other hand, labels can be 
placed on the four sides of the rectangle 
when k = 4. The parameter t, t ∈ {opo, 
po, s}, refers to the type of leaders 
allowed for connecting sites to labels. 
The opo, po, and s stand for 
orthogonal-parallel-orthogonal, 
parallel-orthogonal and straight-line,

Reduced from the DCP, we can show 
the following theorem: 
 
Theorem CP1ML-opo is NP- complete. 
 
In addition, we show that the median 
heuristic introduced in [4] is an 
approximation algorithm with 
approximation ratio three. 
Reduced from CP1ML-opo, we can 
show the follow theorem: 
 
Theorem CP2ML-opo is NP-complete 
even when n1 = n2. 
 
In addition, we modify the 
1.431-approximation algorithm [5] for 
the MAX-Bisection problem to devise an 
approximation algorithm for the CP2ML 
with an approximation ratio about three. 
 
As for the case of type-po leaders, we 
have the following results: 
 
Theorem DCP1ML-po is NP-complete. 
 
We investigate an alternative objective to 
minimize the total leader length, called 
the leader length problem for 
many-to-one labeling (LLPML). 
Following Bekos et al.’s result [2], we 
can show the following: 
 
Theorem LLPML can be solved in O (n2 
log3 n) time. 
四、結論與未來展望 
The main contributions of this project 
include: (1) Crossing minimization problems 
for both one-side and two-side   
many-to-one labeling with type-opo leaders 
are proved to be NP-complete. We also 
design approximation algorithms to cope 
with such intractable problems. (2) Crossing 
minimization problem for one-side 
many-to-one labeling with type-po leaders is 
proved to be NP-complete. A heuristic 
algorithm with satisfactory experimental 
results is also given for this problem. (3) We 
show the many-to-one labeling with the 
objective to minimize the total leader 
length to be solvable in polynomial time.
