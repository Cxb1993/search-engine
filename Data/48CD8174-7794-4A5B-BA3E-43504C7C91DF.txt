II. THE SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT 
In this study, a parabolic function is utilized 
as the probability index to simulate the vehicle 
movement of each lane, and four sensors 
around each junction are used to acquire the 
vehicles flow data.  
A. The Traffic Model 
To model the vehicle flow, a parabolic 
equation cbtattf ++= 2)(  is applied to 
determine the arrival of a vehicle over a time 
unit (1 sec). Assume the vehicle number of a 
particular lane over some fixed time interval T 
be VN, the maximum flow occurs at time T/2, 
and the initial condition )0(f  is given, then the 
three parameters, a, b, and c, can be obtained. 
The procedure for determining the vehicle 
occurrences of each lane is as follows: 
1. For each traffic junction, let the total 
vehicles of a direction over time interval T 
be TV, then the VN of each lane in the time 
interval is about NTV . (N is the number of 
lanes in the direction). 
2. The probability threshold at time T' is )(Tf ′ . 
3. Generate a random number ]1,0[∈r , if 
)'(Tfr <  then one vehicle occurs at the time 
unit, else none. 
B. The Simulation Environment 
Each junction is composed of four ways: east, 
west, north and south directions (See Fig. 1).  
Four data of each direction are measured. They 
are queue length, vehicle’s waiting time, total 
vehicles generated from the direction and total 
vehicles pass through the junction. In addition 
to the adjustable green light and red light 
phases, the yellow light phase is set as 3 
seconds. Following is the detailed procedure 
for simulating a vehicle passing: 
 
 
 
 
(a) East-West direction     (b) North-South direction 
Fig.1 The composition of a junction 
 
1. For an observed junction, determine whether 
a vehicle comes from some lane by using the 
parabolic probability index. 
2. The road length of each direction is defined 
by time interval. A length of 18 seconds 
means that a vehicle must spend 18 seconds 
to drive through the road. 
3. As the vehicle arrives at the junction and 
waits for passing through, the queue length 
and waiting time are recorded.  
4. If the junction is in green light phase and the 
front vehicles are passing through, then this 
vehicle will also pass, otherwise keep 
waiting. 
5. Calculate the turn probability (left turn, right 
turn or forward), determine the turn 
direction of the vehicle. 
6. If the vehicle leaves the junction group then 
end, else repeat steps 2 to 6. 
 
C. Sensor Detecting Method for Vehicle Flow 
Four sensors are set around each junction 
(see Fig. 2). The totally passing vehicles and 
the turn probability can then be calculated. For 
example of junction B, the accumulated 
entering vehicles of the east-west direction 
(aev_ew) at time t can be detected by sensors 
c1 and a3: 
 ( ) ( ) ( )tavtavtewaev ac 31_ += , (1) 
 
where ( )tavkj  denotes the accumulative 
vehicles passing through sensor j of junction k 
at time t. The accumulated leaving vehicles of 
the east-west direction (alv_ew) can be detected 
by sensors b0, b1, b2 and b3: 
 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )tavtavtavtavtewalv bbbb 3210_ +++= , (2)

For the applied genetic algorithm, the 
population size is 20, and the individual is 
coded as shown in Fig. 5. Among the 
parameters in Fig. 5, q1, q2, q3, w1, w2 and w3 
are coded by using 8 bits each, the parameters 
e1, e2 and e3 are 6 bits each, while 3 bits are 
used to code each of ir , 81,...,2,1=i . Since there 
are seven possible fuzzy sets in the consequent 
parts of the rules, the three bits used to 
represent the consequent part ir  has the 
mapping relation as shown in Table II. 
To enhance the evolution, the rule part of one 
of the 20 initial individuals is initialized 
intuitively as the one shown in Table III.  
Setting such an initial individual has the 
purpose of ensuring an acceptable fitness value 
at the first generation. The reproduction 
process at every generation is accomplished by 
saving the 10 top-ranking individuals with the 
rest 10 replaced by new individuals. The 
operations of the genetic operators are 
described in details in the following. For 
crossover operation, a binary individual S is 
randomly generated to determine the 
inheritance of the parents’ genes. Let the four 
strings A, B, C and D denote the parent and 
child individuals. The crossover operation is 
defined by the following equations.

In this procedure, one parent is selected from 
the 10 top-ranking individuals and the other is 
randomly selected from the remaining in the 
population.  The child individuals replaced two 
of the 10 down-ranking individuals. To 
accomplish the mutation process, some 
individuals are randomly selected from the 
population for duplication. The mutation 
operation is achieved by randomly altering the 
binary bits of the duplicated individuals.  These 
new individuals replace some of the 10 down-
ranking individuals. Both of the crossover and 
mutation processes are reiterated if a duplicated 
child appears. Besides, a new individual is 
randomly generated to replace one of the 10 
down-ranking individuals at every generation 
to increase the ability of avoiding the premature 
convergence. 
The termination condition is defined 
according to the number of junctions. Since the 
individual length is equal to 24 times of the 
junction number, the size of the search space is 
proportional to the junction number. In this 
study, the termination condition is set as 100 
generations for 22×  case and 250 generations 
for 33×  case.
