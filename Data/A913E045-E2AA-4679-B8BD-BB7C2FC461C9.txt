三、計畫緣由與目的 
The ever-growing demand for Internet bandwidth 
and recent advances in optical Wavelength Division 
Multiplexing (WDM) [1] technologies brings about 
fundamental changes in the design and 
implementation of the next generation networks. Even 
though the optical long-haul Internet has been 
designed to foster the current traffic demand and 
bandwidth growth trend, two critical bottlenecks are 
still present in network chains. The first one is the 
so-called last mile, or access networks, which provide 
bandwidth directly to end-users. The other one that 
behaves as transitional bandwidth distributors 
between the optical Internet and access networks is 
the core of Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) [2], 
referred to as metro core network. Long-haul optical 
Internet is based on a mesh topology, and follows the 
Optical Circuit Switching (OCS) paradigm by making 
relatively static WDM channel utilization. As 
opposed to it, optical metro core networks are based 
on mesh, ring, or bus topologies. Prevailing examples 
of mesh and ring networks are packet-over-WDM 
(PoW), and packet-over-SONET (PoS), respectively. 
Unlike long-haul backbone networks, metro 
networks exhibit highly dynamic traffic demand, 
rendering static WDM channel utilization completely 
infeasible. Accordingly, while mesh-based networks 
require fine-grained packet-switched-based on- 
demand channel allocation, namely Optical Packet 
Switching (OPS) [3-6], ring/bus networks require 
versatile Medium Access Control (MAC) schemes to 
assure efficient bandwidth allocation and various 
Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. Unfortunately, 
the OPS technique currently faces some technological 
limitations, such as the lack of optical signal 
processing and optical buffer, and large switching 
overhead. To alleviate these limitations, much 
research work has been devoted to seeking for 
promising OPS alternatives. Among them, Optical 
Burst Switching (OBS) [7-12] has been considered a 
promising candidate, however only suitable for 
long-haul backbone networks. Moreover, for ring/bus 
metro networks, most existing MAC schemes either 
discount the existence of wavelengths, or disregard 
QoS guarantees. 
During this three-year project, we have designed, 
analyzed, and constructed of PoW mesh/ring metro 
networks. In the first year, we focus on the 
mesh-topology line of work. We have proposed a new 
Optical Coarse Packet Switching (OCPS) [13,14] 
paradigm for OCPS mesh-based metro core networks. 
Combining the best of OPS and OBS, OCPS 
advocates the enforcement of manageable traffic 
control and engineering to realize bandwidth-on- 
demand on sub-wavelength basis while circumventing 
OPS limitations. Based on OCPS, we have 
constructed an experimental optical IP-over-WDM 
network testbed, referred to as OPSINET. OPSINET 
consists of three types of nodes-edge routers, optical 
lambda/fiber switches (OXCs), and Optical Label 
Switched Routers (OLSRs). To facilitate traffic 
engineering, OPSINET is augmented with an out-of- 
band Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching 
(GMPLS) [15] control network. In sequel, we focus 
on QoS burstification control of OPSINET. 
The QoS burstification control of OPSINET is 
performed by a QoS-enhanced traffic control scheme, 
called (ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper, where ψ and τ are the 
maximum burst size (packet count) and maximum 
burst assembly time, respectively. Essentially, 
(ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper is a dual-purpose scheme. It 
is a scheduler for packets, abbreviated as (ψ,τ)- 
Scheduler, which performs the scheduling of 
different delay class packets into back-to-back bursts. 
On the other hand, it is a shaper for bursts, referred to 
as (ψ,τ)-Shaper, which determines the sizes and 
departure times of bursts. 
To provide delay class differentiation, for IP 
packet flows designated with delay-associated 
weights, (ψ,τ)-Scheduler performs packet scheduling 
and assembly into bursts based on their weights and a 
virtual window of size ψ. The Scheduler exerts simple 
FIFO service within the window and assures weight- 
proportional service at the window boundary. The 
scheme, as will be shown, provides different classes 
of 99% delay bound guarantees. To provide loss class 
differentiation, (ψ,τ)-Shaper facilitates traffic shaping 
with a larger burst size (ψ) assigned to a higher 
 4
metropolitan areas, as well as data transfer from local 
networks to the backbone. According to the 
increasing portion of bursty data and multimedia 
traffic, the design focus of the networks is an efficient, 
flexible, and reliable optical packet switched for 
metro area networks. 
Network nodes require dynamic capability to 
access a ring network flexibly and effectively. Nodes 
are generally equipped with tunable transmitters and 
tunable receivers [33-36]. Some networks adopt fixed 
transmitter and receiver arrays to achieve this 
objective [35,37,[38]. Advances in fast tunable lasers 
suggest that laser tuning times within several 
nano-seconds are commercially available, enabling 
fast and dynamic access to network resources. A 
Tunable Transmitter - Fixed Receiver (TT-FR) based 
bi-directional WDM ring network [33] has been 
implemented. The DQBR MAC (modified from IEEE 
802.16 DQDB) exhibits various performance benefits, 
including high utilization and fairness, but requires a 
lot of counters to monitor the network status, leading 
to scalability problems. Additionally, their prototype 
network still suffers from the fairness problem while 
the traffic load exceeds 0.7.  
An experimental ring network that uses low-cost 
commercial available components was demonstrated 
in [35]. The MAC protocol is based on the 
synchronous round robin (SRR) strategy. The latest 
version of SRR [36] combines TDMA, tokens and 
slot reservations to achieve high utilization and 
guarantee fairness. However, the MAC is too complex 
for most practical conditions. 
DAVID is a major project for optical 
packet-switched MAN and WAN networks [34]. A 
DAVID metro network comprises several single fiber 
rings interconnected via a hub node. Since the hub 
exchanges packets among rings directly in the optical 
domain, careful slot reservation is necessary to 
achieve a feasible wavelength-to-wavelength 
permutation. DAVID is based on TT-TR architecture. 
Each node has an SOA-based slot eraser, enabling 
high slot reuse at the expense of prohibitive system 
cost.  
The number of nodes in the network equals the 
number of required wavelengths in all the above 
architectures, making them hard to scale up. To 
overcome the problem, a FT-FR4 architecture [[38] 
has been proposed that the number of network nodes 
can exceed the number of the required wavelengths. 
Although capable of significantly enhancing the 
network performance, the proposed destination 
stripping scheme still suffers the unfairness problem 
from the proposed MAC. 
In this work, we aim at the design and 
experimentation of an optical packet-switched metro 
WDM ring network (HOPSMAN), capable of 
achieving high cost-effectiveness, architecture 
scalability, and superior Medium Access Control 
(MAC) performance on bandwidth utilization, access 
delay, fairness, and bursty traffic adaptation. 
The remainder of this report is organized as 
follows. In Section 4.1, we present the 
(ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper design and performance 
comparison. In Section 4.2, we present the LRH 
approach and its primal heuristic algorithm to resolve 
RWA problem. In Section 4.3, we demonstrate the 
HOPSMAN network design. Finally, concluding 
remarks are made in Section 4.4. 
四、成果與討論 
4.1 (ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper 
4.1.1 Architecture and Design 
In any ingress node, incoming packets (see Figure 
1(a)) are first classified on the basis of their 
destination, loss and delay classes. Packets belonging 
to the same destination and loss class are assembled 
into a burst. Thus, a burst may contain packets 
belonging to different delay classes. In the figure, we 
assume there are M destination/loss classes and N 
delay classes in the system. For any one of M 
destination/loss classes, say class k, packets of flows 
belonging to N different delay classes are assembled 
into bursts through (ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaperk according 
to their pre-assigned delay-associated weights. 
Departing bursts from any (ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper are 
optically transmitted, and forwarded via their 
corresponding, pre-established OLSP. 
Essentially, (ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper is a 
dual-purpose scheme. It is a scheduler for packets, 
abbreviated as (ψ,τ)-Scheduler, which performs the 
scheduling of different delay class packets into 
back-to-back bursts. On the other hand, it is a shaper 
for bursts, referred to as (ψ,τ)-Shaper, which 
determines the sizes and departure times of bursts.  
In the (ψ,τ)-Scheduler system, each delay class is 
associated with a per-determined weight. A higher 
delay priority class is given a greater weight, which 
corresponds to a more stringent delay bound 
class can be adjusted to meet its delay/bound 
requirements. For example, as shown in Figure 3(b), 
to meet a 99% delay bound guarantee of 200 slots for 
class C1, the weight of C1 must be greater than 7, 
given the weights of three other classes of 6, 5, and 4, 
respectively. 
For clarity purposes, we highlight the operation of 
(ψ,τ)-Shaper, particularly the BATr part of the system 
in the sequel. A burst of size ψ is generated and 
transmitted if the total number of packets reaches ψ 
before the burst assembly time exceeds τ. Otherwise, 
a burst of size less than ψ is generated when BATr 
expires. The BATr is initialized as the τ value when it 
is activated or reset. The BATr is activated when the 
system is changed from being idle to busy due to new 
packet arrivals. The BATr is immediately reset when 
a burst departs leaving behind a non-empty queue. 
4.1.3 Loss QoS Performance Comparison 
In this section, we demonstrate the performance 
of (ψ,τ)-Shaper on loss QoS performance comparison 
between the OCPS and the JET-based OBS [8] 
networks. Rather than considering one single 
switching node, we have simulated an entire optical 
network with QoS burst truncation and full 
wavelength conversion capabilities equipped in each 
switching node. The network we used in the 
experiment is the well-known ARPANET network 
[17] with 24 nodes and 48 links, in which 14 nodes 
are randomly selected as edge nodes. OLSP routing is 
subject to load balance of the network. Each link has 
up to 100 wavelengths, transmitting at 1 Gb/s, or one 
60-byte packet per slot of duration 0.48µs. In 
simulations, departing bursts from ingress nodes can 
be served by any free wavelength, though, only after 
the previous burst has been fully transmitted. 
In simulations, we generate packets according to

packets have not yet departed from the switch. 
Simulations results are displayed in Figure 5. 
We draw comparisons of packet loss probabilities 
of all three traffic classes between the OCPS and 
three variants of OBS networks using three 
extra-delay settings, respectively, under four cases set 
by two burst sizes (ψ= 25, 100) and two header 
processing times (δ= 9.6µs, 48µs). First, we observe 
from the figure that the OCPS and OBS networks 
provide typically the same grade of loss performance 
for Classes M and L under all four cases. Significantly, 
we discover that, compared to OCPS as shown in 
Figures 5(a) and (c), OBS undergoes several orders of 
magnitude deterioration in packet loss performance 
for Class H traffic particularly under a smaller burst 
size, i.e., ψH=ψM=ψL=25. Among the three OBS 
variants, OBS(2,1,0) using the smallest extra offset 
time difference (=T) invariably suffers from the 
poorest packet loss probability. Such performance 
degradation is caused by the near-far problem that 
exacerbates under a smaller burst size, a larger header 
processing time, and/or a smaller extra offset time 
difference. Under any of the conditions, the offset 
time of a Class-H burst is more likely to be smaller 
than that of a Class-M or Class-L burst, resulting in 
failing to make earlier wavelength reservation for the 
burst. This fact accounts for the poorest performance 
for Class H taking place under ψH=ψM=ψL=25 and 
δ=48µs, as shown in Figure 5(a). As the burst size 
increases and the processing time decreases, as shown 
in Figures 5(b), (c) and (d), the near-far problem is 
relaxed, yielding noticeable performance 
improvement for Class H in OBS networks. As

duality theorem [30], dualZ  is a lower bound of the 
original Problem (P) for any non-negative Lagrangean 
multiplier vector ρ= (q, r, s) ≥ 0. Clearly, we 
determine the greatest lower bound, i.e., 
0
max ( )LB dualZ Zρ ρ>= , which can be solved by the 
subgradient method. Specifically, in the kth interation 
of the subgradient optimization procedure, 
Lagrangean multiplier vector ρ is updated as 
1k k kbkρ ρ θ+ = + , where kθ  is the step size, 
determined by 2( ( )) /k k dual k kUB Z bθ λ ρ= − , in 
which λk is the step size coefficient, UB is the current 
achievable least upper bound obtained from the 
heuristic algorithm described next, and bk is a 
subgradient of Zdual(ρ) with vector size |L+LW + 
LFW|.  
 10
The primal heuristic algorithm in the LRH 
approach is used to find an updated upper bound ub. 
Similar to the lower bound case, if the new upper 
bound (ub) is tighter (smaller) than the current best 
achievable upper bound (UB), the new upper bound is 
designated as the UB. 
At the end of the computation, the costs of those 
links associated with the selected wavelengths/paths 
are set to ∞ to prevent the links from being considered 
by other upcoming iterations. If the number of 
wavelengths (lightpaths) used on a link is greater than 
the current tightest lower bound multiplied by |W|, 
indicating potential congestion, the cost of the link is 
then scaled by multiplying by a constant, referred to 
as the penalty term. This is to avoid further lightpath 
set-up through this link. The process repeats until 
either the lightpath demands of all SD pairs are 
satisfied (i.e., feasible), or there is no remaining 
resource (i.e., infeasible) in the network. 
4.2.3 Performance Comparisons 
We have carried out a performance study on the 
LRH approach, and drawn comparisons between LRH 
and the Banerjee&Mukherjee approach [23] via 
experiments over randomly generated networks. 
Given the total number of nodes, say n, the greatest 
possible number of bi-directional links is , 
where C is the combination operation. Then, for a 
network with n nodes and connectivity v, it is 
generated by randomly selecting C n  out of 
the  bi-directional links of the network. In the 
experiments, we used 32 wavelengths on each fiber 
link (i.e., |W|=32) for all networks. 
( ,2)C n

Accordingly in the experiment, we considered the 
random network, as shown in Figure 6(a). Random 
network consists of 11 nodes including 2 FSC (nodes 
1-2) or 4 FSC (nodes 1-4) nodes, and 22 bi-directional 
links, corresponding to a connectivity (v) of 0.4. 
Results are plotted in Figures 6(b) and 6(c). 
In the computation using our LRH approach, we 
adopted QT=50 and three different termination 
criteria. The two criteria are: Iteration_Number =1000, 
2000. The algorithm was written in the C language 
and operated on a PC running Windows XP with a 
2.53GHz CPU power. In the LPR-based method, by

for large sized networks, we carried out experiments 
on two well-known ARPA network, as shown in 
Figure 9(a). The ARPA network has 61 nodes 
including 4 FSC nodes and 148 bi-directional links, 
which corresponds to a connectivity (v) of 0.04. There 
are 64 wavelengths on each fiber for both networks. 
Numerical results are displayed in Figure 9. 
In the experiment, we adopted QT=50 and two 
different termination criteria, namely 
Iteration_Number=500 and 1000. For the USA 
network, LRH achieves a guarantee of no more than 
8% Gap between the upper and lower bounds under 
both termination criteria. For the ARPA network, the 
LRH achieves a guarantee of no more than 9.3% Gap 
in less than 9400 sec computation time. We 
particularly observe from Figure 9(c) that the 
accuracy of the LRH approach based on the 
500-iteration termination criterion is as high as that 
based on the 1000-iteration termination criterion 
under most lightpath demand cases. This again 
demonstrates the superiority of the LRH approach to 
the RWA+ problem with respect to both computation 
accuracy and time complexity for large sized 
networks. 
4.3 Optical Metro Ring Network 
4.3.1 Network and Node Architectures (a) Topology (61 nodes and 148 links)
Nodes in HOPSMAN are interconnected via a 
single unidirectional fiber that carries multiple WDM 
data channels (λ1-λW,10-Gb/s) and one control 
channel (λ0, 2.5-Gb/s) containing the status of data 
channels. Channels are further divided into 
synchronous time slots. Nodes are equipped with one 
fixed transmitter/receiver for accessing the control 
channel; and one or multiple tunable transmitter(s)/ 
receiver(s) for dropping/adding packets from/to data 
channels on a slot basis. 
 12
HOPSMAN has three types of nodes- POP-node 
(P-node), Ordinary-node (O-node), and Server-node 
(S-node). A P-node is a gateway between HOPSMAN 
and long-haul networks, and typically includes 
multiple tunable transmitters/receivers. An O-node is 
a regular node with one tunable transmitter/receiver. 
Finally, an S-node is an O-node but additionally 
equipped with a slot-eraser device, making bandwidth 
reusable and thus achieving greater bandwidth 
efficiency. Notice revealed by our study that, 
bandwidth efficiency improves greatly with only a 
few S-nodes in a network.

4.3.3 Experimentation and Results 
We constructed an experimental ring testbed for 
HOPSMAN. The ring is 38.3 km long (500 time slots, 
50 slots/cycle, and 320 ns/slot), and includes two 
O-nodes and one S-node. The testbed uses four data 
channels on wavelengths at 1551.72nm, 1553.33nm, 
1554.94nm and 1556.55nm; and a control channel on 
wavelength at 1540.56nm. The input and output 
powers per channel are kept at -10dBm and 0dBm, 
respectively, by attenuators and amplifiers on the 
ring. 
Within the S-node (Figure 12(a)), besides the 
MAC processor, the node is equipped with a network 
processor and Ethernet interface, including a 2.5-Gb/s 
burst mode receiver (BMR), to establish real network 
connectivity and display video packets. Notice that, 
due to unavailability of higher speed BMRs, each data 
channel is downgraded to 2.5 Gb/s in the testbed. The 
MAC and network processors were implemented via 
Xilinx Vertex-II and Spartan3 FPGA chips, 
respectively. The slot eraser was constructed via a 
pair of Mux/Demux and an array of SOA gates, which 
can be on/off turned in 5 ns. 
First, the boundaries of the data and control slots 
were fully synchronized as shown in Figure 12(b). 
Besides, the node used a tunable receiver to extract 
signal from one of four wavelengths through a 
four-wave-mixing based filter. Via a tunable laser and 
SOA, the chosen data wavelength was converted to 
the wavelength of the fixed filter (Figure 12(c)), with 
18dB conversion efficiency. The output channel’s eye 
diagram is shown in Figure 12(c). Finally, to inject 
data packets to the ring, we adopted an SG-DBR 
tunable laser with 40ns tuning delay, resulting in a 
guard time between data packets being set as 40ns. 
Above results demonstrate the viability and 
superiority of HOPSMAN.

五、計畫成果自評 
In this final report, we first propose a 
dual-purpose, delay and loss QoS-enhanced traffic 
control scheme, called (ψ,τ)-Scheduler/Shaper, 
exerted at ingress nodes for OCPS IP-over-WDM 
networks. Providing delay class differentiation, 
(ψ,τ)-Scheduler assures each weight-based delay 
class a stochastic 99% delay bound obtained from 
simulation results. In addition, (ψ,τ)-Shaper provides 
loss class differentiation by means of assigning larger 
burst sizes to higher priority classes. We have 
performed simulations on an ARPANET network to 
make loss performance comparisons between the 
OCPS with (ψ,τ)-Shaper and the Just-Enough-Time 
(JET)-based OBS networks. Simulation results 
demonstrated that, due to the near-far problem, OBS 
undergoes several orders of magnitude increase in 
packet loss probability for Class H traffic particularly 
under a smaller burst size. As opposed to OBS, the 
in-band-controlled-based OCPS network was shown 
to provide invariably superior packet loss 
performance for a high priority traffic class, enabling 
effective facilitation of loss class differentiation. 
In the second year, we have resolved a RWA+ 
problem using the LRH method, which is a 
Lagrangean Relaxation based approach augmented 
with an efficient primal heuristic algorithm. With the 
aid of generated Lagrangean multipliers and lower 
bound indexes, the primal heuristic algorithm of LRH 
achieves a near-optimal upper-bound solution. A 
performance study delineated that the performance 
trade-off between accuracy and convergence speed 
can be manipulated via adjusting the Quiescence 
Threshold parameter in the algorithm. We have drawn 
comparisons of accuracy and computation time 
between LRH and the Linear Programming 
Relaxation (LPR)-based method, under random 
network. Experimental results demonstrated that, 
particularly for small to medium sized networks, the 
LRH approach using a termination requirement 
profoundly outperforms the LPR method and 
fixed-iteration-based LRH, in both accuracy and
