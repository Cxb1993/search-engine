Abstract 
The averages control charts (or X  charts) are widely applied in statistical process control. 
The conventional Shewhart X  charts are static because the three chart parameters (the sampling 
interval, h; the sample size, n; and the control limit coefficient, k) are fixed for the duration of the 
operation that is monitored. Recent studies has demonstrated the adaptive (i.e., dynamic control 
chart, the sampling interval, the sample size and the control limit coefficient are variable) X  
control charts are quicker than standard Shewhart (SS) X  control chart in detecting process mean 
shifts by statistical and economic criteria. The usual assumption for designing a control chart is that 
the observations from the process are independent. However, for many processes, such as chemical 
processes, consecutive measurements are often highly correlated. In the present project, the 
observations are modeled as an AR(1) process plus a random error, and the properties of the 
adaptive control charts are evaluated and studied under this model. The numerical example of

A fundamental assumption in the typical application of control charts is that the observations 
from the process at different time points are independent. However, this assumption may not be 
tenable in some production processes, e.g. the continuous chemical processes. The presence of 
autocorrelation in the process data can result in significant effect on the false alarm and detection 
ability. Reynolds et al. (1996) presented that autocorrelation is a significant problem for a VSI chart, 
because some of the observations are taken using a relatively short sampling interval. They 
provided a time series model, in which the observations are modeled as a first-order autoregressive 
(AR(1)) model plus an additional random error, to study the properties of the VSI and FP control 
charts. Lu and Reynolds (1999 and 2001) evaluated the statistical performance of exponentially 
weighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts for an autocorrelated 
process using the same model. Lin (2009) and Lin and Chou (2008) also evaluated the statistical 
performance of VSR and VP control chart using this model. 
The objective of this project is focusing explicitly on the economic design, properties and 
sensitivity analyses of adaptive control charts when the autocorrelation exists in the process, i.e., 
VSI, VSS, VSR and VP X  charts. In the present project, a time series model will be used to 
evaluate the performance of adaptive X  control charts. Therefore, the economic measures of 
performance are developed by using the special cost model, this model allows us to obtain the 
adaptive control chart’s properties and sensitivity analyses. In this project, a numerical example will 
be shown to illustrate the solution procedure of the economic design of the adaptive X  chart for 
an autocorrelation process using the AR(1) model. Some sensitivity analyses will be conducted to 
evaluate the effect of input parameter and various distributions on the optimal economically design 
of adaptive X  chart. 
The model of autocorrelation for a control chart  
In the present project, the model in Reynolds et al. (1996) is used to investigate the effect of 
autocorrelation on the performance of VP X  chart. Suppose that observations are taken from an

In practical applications, the X  control chart is usually used to monitor the process mean

where ijε  is the jth random error at sampling time it . The statistic iX  is the sample average at

For a VP X  chart, the sample size and sampling interval of the next sample are determined 
from the data of current sample. Reynolds et al. (1996) assumed that the sampling interval between 
sampling time points 1−it  and it  is h time units and h>0. Therefore, the random process mean iμ

The operation of GA involves following steps: (a) create a random initial solution; (b) evaluate 
fitness, i.e., the objective function that minimizes the ECTU; (c) reproduction, crossover and 
mutation; (d) generate new solution. The algorithm uses an iterative approach to find the optimal 
solutions. The GA provides a more efficient and systematic way to solve the economic design of the 
adaptive X  charts. 
 
Conclusions  
In this project, a numerical example will be shown to illustrate the solution procedure of the 
economic design of the adaptive X  chart for an autocorrelation process using the AR(1) model. 
Base on the study, we may draw the following conclusions: 
(1) As the level of autocorrelation increases, the ECTU of control chart also increase, which 
indicates that it takes more costs to detect the mean shifts. 
(2) The VP X  charts have relatively lower AATS and ECTU values than other control charts, 
which indicate that the VP X  charts have relatively faster detection time and lower cost to 
detect the process mean shifts. 
(3) The sampling interval tends to be long as the mean shift is small, and be short as the mean 
shift is large. For VSI, the short sampling interval may be as practically short as possible, e.g., 
the short interval h2 is equal to 0.1. 
(4) The sample size tends to be large as the mean shift is small, and be small as the mean shift is 
large. 
(5) The value of the action limit coefficients and the warning limit coefficients tends to be small 
as the mean shift is small, and be large as the mean shift is large. For VP scheme, the wider 
action limit coefficients have relatively larger value as the large mean shift occurs
