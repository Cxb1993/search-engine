and Lin [4] presented a progressive approach to share the secret image, in which the quality of the reconstructed 
image improves with the number of images shared. Hung et al. [9] utilized DCT and band partition to share the 
secret image progressively. Fang [6] presented a progressive method of sharing binary images, supporting rapid, 
lossless, and secure decoding. Wu et al. [22] used S-E tables to reduce the size of shared images, and hid the 
shared images within natural images to reduce the likelihood of having them noticed by attackers. Chen and Fu 
[3] adopted the Blakley geometry sharing method to share images secretly. Tso [19] first quantized the secret 
image, before sharing it according to the concept of Blakley. Shyu and Chen [15] presented a method of sharing 
images secretly using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Wang and Shyu [20] presented a scalable scheme for 
sharing the secret image, in which the region of the recovered image is proportional to the number of images 
shared. Tang and Huang [16] further improved Wang and Shyu’s 2-out-of-n to k-out-of-n scalable scheme for 
sharing the secret image. Chen and Wu [5] presented a method based on Boolean operators for sharing many 
secret images at the same time. Huang et al. [8] utilized the SPIHT to share images progressively. Wang et al. 
[21] proposed a scalable user-friendly scheme for sharing the secret image, in which each shared image has 
distinguishable content and it looks like a shrunken replica of the original image. 
Although numerous methods for sharing secret images have been proposed, the computational load of 
conventional methods based on Shamir and Lagrange interpolation, remains a problem requiring improvement. 
Shyu and Chen [15] focused their study on a scheme for sharing the secret image according to Chinese 
Remainder Theorem, which is more efficient than conventional methods. Moreover, because assigning the 
same weight to all shared images does not always meet practical requirements, a study on variously weighting 
shared images is also required. This investigation presents an improvement on the method of Shyu and Chen 
[15] for improving the size of shared images, the order of secret keys, and the number of secret keys for shared 
images with a weight greater than 1. The usage of Chinese Remainder Theorem relies on low computation 
complexity and easily satisfied weighting criteria. The Chinese Remainder Theorem shares a secret number 
among n shares by calculating the remainder of a division of the secret number and each prime number as each 
share. All remainders and prime numbers are required to recover the secret number.  
This study presents an (s, t, n) scheme for sharing the secret image. A secret image is shared with s shared 
images, each of which has a weight of one or more. The total weight of these s shared images is n, and shared 
images with total weights t are calculated to recover the secret image. To find the thresholds (s, t, n) using in the 
Chinese Remainder Theorem, the dealer must first select n prime numbers and two numbers that are products 
from these t and t -1 prime numbers. Then the secret numbers have to be adjusted to the range set according to 
these two products. Therefore, t shared numbers are capable of recovering the above shifted secret number. An 
image is segmented to numbers and each number is then shared among n participants by calculating the 
remainder of a division of the number and the secret key possessed by every participant. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce studies related to the 
proposed method, particularly on the sharing of images using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Section 3 
illustrates the proposed weighted secret image sharing method. Algorithms for sharing a secret image to shared 
images and recovering the secret image from shared images are presented in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. 
Section 4 presents experimental results and comparisons between the proposed scheme and other methods. In 
Section 5, we draw our conclusions. 
2. Reviews of Related Works 
This section introduces conventional methods for sharing the secret image based on the Chinese Remainder 
Theorem. Section 2.1 briefly introduces the (n, n) secret image sharing method using the Chinese Remainder 
Theorem. However, this method does not exhibit (t, n) threshold properties with any tn , t2 and is capable of

Notably, in Step 2, each prime number qi is calculated only once to yield a secret key kj. In Step 3, the secret

Similarly, the relationship of 2 2(mod )kn n q  can also be acquired, too. Therefore, the correctness of the 
proposed weighted scheme is proven. 
The relationship between selected numbers and the size of shared image is also discussed. Assume that the 
selected threshold in our proposed weighted secret image sharing method is (4, 3, 5). Prime numbers are 
required as keys held by participants. The selected prime numbers determine the parameters α and β, in which 
pixels of the secret image are represented as numbers located in the range between α and β. In the manner, the 
size of the shared image can also be determined. Table 1 compares the selection of various prime numbers in a 
(4, 3, 5) weighted secret image sharing method. When the selected prime numbers are 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, the 
parameters α and β are 3127 and 82861, respectively. Therefore, the difference between α and β is 79734, 
exceeding 65536(2
16
) and the secret image can be partitioned to numbers of 16 bits. Each shared number of 1-
weight shared image is the remainder of a division of the shifted secret number and the prime number. Hence, 
storing the remainder to a 6-bit number is adequate, because all selected prime numbers are smaller than 2
6
. 
Table 1 also compares the parameters with two other sets of prime numbers. All of these three selections in this 
table are determined by β-α=(28)n. Moreover, in a (4, 3, 5) weighted secret image sharing method, the ideal 1-
weight shared image size is 1/3 because shared images of weight 3 are utilized to recover the secret image. 
Table 1 shows that the selection of large prime numbers yields a shared image with size close to 1/3 of the 
secret image size.

4.2 Performance Comparison 
This section compares the properties of the proposed scheme and other important methods. Table 2 illustrates 
the computation complexity and computation time between the proposed CRT-based scheme and Thien and 
Lin’s [17] method, which is the conventional Shamir-based method. 
Table 2. Computation time comparison between the proposed scheme and Thien and Lin’s [17] method 
Schemes Computation complexity Computation time 
Thien and Lin’s method [17] O(NlogN) 
Sharing: 0.86 sec. 
Recovery: 55.99 sec. 
The proposed method O(KlogM) 
Sharing: 0.98 sec. 
Recovery: 0.90 sec. 
 
Complexity in the proposed scheme, as shown in Table 2, is O(KlogM), where K is the computation loop and 
M is the largest possessing key. On the other hand, Thien and Lin’s method has time complexity O(NlogN), 
where N is the size of image. A comparison of computation time shows that the proposed scheme and the 
Shamir-based method have nearly the same sharing time of less than 1 second. However, in the recovery 
procedures, the proposed scheme still has a low computation load of less than 1 second. However, the Shamir-
based method requires more computation time to recover the secret image due to the use of the Lagrange 
interpolation with the computation time exceeding 55 seconds. Table 2 shows the computation efficiency of the 
proposed CRT-based scheme. 
We also compared the proposed method with other important methods [4, 5, 7, 17, 21-23], including visual 
cryptography and secret image sharing methods. The compared features, as shown in Table 3, are explained as 
follows. 
(1) Kernel method: Main techniques in sharing and recovery procedures are noted as kernel methods. 
Sharing using the Shamir method and recovery using Lagrange interpolation are the most popular 
schemes [4, 17, 21~23]. However, some other techniques, such as Boolean operators [5], VCC [7], and 
Chinese Remainder Theorem (the proposed scheme), can also be applied to share a secret image. 
(2) Decoding complexity: The computation load of recovering the secret image shows the efficiency of a 
scheme. Hou’s method [7], stacking shared images to recover the secret image, has the lowest 
computation load. Shamir-based schemes [4, 17,21~23] are the most complex techniques in these studies. 
The proposed scheme, based on CRT, provides moderate complexity compared with these two extreme 
techniques. In addition, boolean operator based methods also provide a moderate degree of complexity 
within these two extreme techniques. 
(3) Features of the scheme: Sharing a secret image to shared images is the fundamental feature. Many 
schemes include other features rather than only secret image sharing. Different characters such as 
progressive [4], multi-secret images sharing [5], scalable[21], size constraint[22], VC(Visual 
Cryptography) and SIS(Secret Image Sharing) [23], and weighted (the proposed scheme) are compared in 
Table 3.  
(4) Other features: Fundamental features in secret image sharing techniques include (t,n)-threshold, perfect 
reconstruction, and stacking-to-see properties. Secret image sharing techniques always satisfy (t,n)-
threshold and perfect reconstruction easily. However, secret image sharing techniques are not always 
satisfied the stacking-to-see properties. Perfect reconstruction means that the reconstructed image is the

This investigation presents a novel method to share an image secretly among shared images using 
the Chinese Remainder Theorem, such that the shared images may be differently weighted. The Chinese 
Remainder Theorem shares a secret number among n shares by calculating the modulus of the secret 
number and prime numbers for each share. All moduli and the secret keys are required to recover the 
secret number. The proposed method presents an (s, t, n) secret image sharing scheme. The secret image 
is shared to s shared images, each a weight of one or more. The total weight of these s shared images is n, 
and shared images with a weight of t are collected to recover the secret image. To find the thresholds (s, 
t, n) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the sharing method must select two numbers that are 
products of t and t-1 prime numbers, and adjust the secret number within the range set by these two 
products. Therefore, t shared numbers can recover above shifted secret number. An image is segmented 
to numbers and then each number is shared among n participants by calculating the modulus of the 
number and that participant’s possessing secret key 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces related works of sharing an image 
using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Section 3 elucidates the proposed different weighted secret 
image sharing method. Introductions of a sharing algorithm and a recovery algorithm are presented in 
sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. Section 4 presents experimental results obtained using the proposed 
method. Section 5 draws conclusions. 
 
2. REVIEWS OF RELATED WORKS 
 
This section introduces the conventional secret image sharing method that is based on the Chinese 
Remainder Theorem. Section 2.1 briefly introduces the (n, n) secret image sharing method using the 
Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, this method does not exhibit the (t, n) threshold property with 
t≤n and it can only recover the secret image by collecting all shared images. Section 2.2 introduces the 
modification of the above (n, n) method to the (t, n) secret image sharing method using the Chinese 
Remainder Theorem. 
 
2.1 (n, n) Secret Image Sharing Method based on Chinese Remainder Theorem 
 
The Chinese Remainder Theorem solves the secret image sharing problem by splitting an image to 
numbers and sharing each number among participants using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. The (n, n) 
secret image sharing and recovery steps are as follows. 
First, the secret image is partitioned to numbers. Then, the modulus of each number and a prime 
number is calculated. The prime number is possessed by one participant as his secret key. Therefore, 
each participant possesses a secret key and a shared image that is combined from all moduli. When all 
secret keys and the corresponding moduli are gathered, the original secret image can be perfectly 
recovered using the reconstruction steps of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. This secret image sharing 
method requires all shared images to recover the image. Lacking any shared image prevents the recovery 
of the secret image. 
 
2.2 (t, n) Secret Image Sharing Method based on Chinese Remainder Theorem 
 
This section introduces the (t, n) secret image sharing method using the Chinese Remainder Theorem 
[7]. This method requires n ordered prime numbers. The first step is to calculate two thresholds α and β 
as product of prime numbers, where α is the product of t smaller prime numbers and β is the product of

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
This section presents the experimental results obtained from the proposed method. The image is 
LENA with size 512×512 and thresholds (4, 3, 5). This threshold assignment partitions the secret image 
to four shared images of total weight five; collecting shared images of weight three recovers the secret 
image. Accordingly, one shared image has weight two and the other three shared images have weight 
one. The selected five prime numbers are 1621, 1627, 1637, 1657, 1663. Therefore, α and β are 
1657×1663=2755591 and 1621×1627×1637=4317369779, respectively. The experiment yields four 
shared images (s1, s2, s3, s4) with corresponding weights (2, 1, 1, 1) and secret keys are 
(2637367(1621×1627), 1637, 1657, 1663), respectively. The secret image is first partitioned to 32 
bit-numbers because that selection of prime numbers satisfies the criterion 324317369779 2755592 2− > . Then, 
2755592 and a random number γj are added to each number, to shift it to between α and β, where γj is 
between 0 and 19644892( 324317369779 2755592 2 1− − − ). Each number is modulated by secret keys 2637367, 
1637, 1657, and 1663 to generate four shared numbers for each shared image. Collecting all shared 
numbers for each secret key acquires four shared images. Figure 1.(a) presents the secret image LENA. 
Figures 1.(b) to (e) depict four shared images that correspond to secret keys 2637367, 1637, 1657, and 
1663. The sizes of the shared images are 512×352, 512×176, 512×176, 512×176, associated with keys 
2637367, 1637, 1657, 1663. The shared number is rearranged to fit the grey image scale, so the shared 
images may be differently sized, with a size that is proportional to the secret key. Collecting shared 
images in Figs. 1.(b) and 1.(c) recovers the secret image because their total weight is three.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
This study presents a novel (s, t, n) weighted secret image sharing method that is based on the 
Chinese Remainder Theorem. The proposed method more efficiently assigns different weights to 
shared images than conventional method and the secret image can be perfectly recovered when the 
weight of the collected shared images exceeds a threshold t. Experimental results indicate that size 
of shared image is close to 1/t when the selected prime numbers are sufficiently large. Reducing the 
shared image size merits further study.
