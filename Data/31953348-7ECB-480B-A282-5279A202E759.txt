Abstract 
A multidomain spectral collocation 
beam propagation method that uses an 
oblique coordinate transformation is 
proposed for analyzing a beam propagating 
in dielectric optical waveguides. Relying on 
the high accuracy of spectral collocation 
scheme in transverse discretization, the 
proposed method achieves extremely small 
power loss (<10-4, for the tilt angle of a tilted 
waveguide up to 020 ) but considerably save 
the computational resources. Furthermore, 
by means of introducing the oblique 
coordinate system, not only a significant 
difficulty arising from staircased 
approximation of refractive index is 
completely avoided but the implementation 
of the present scheme becomes easier. To 
validate the effectiveness, numerical results 
for propagating beam in a tilted step-index 
optical waveguide are compared with other 
beam propagation algorithms.

二、INTRODUCTION 
The most widely used numerical 
technique to simulate photonic integrated 
circuits is beam propagation method (BPM) 
[1]. For the conventionally used paraxial or 
wide-angle BPM based on various schemes, 
optical beams are generally assumed to 
propagate along or close to the z axis and the 
Helmholtz equations are usually derived in 
the rectangular coordinate system (RCS). 
Apparently, the numerical errors are induced 
by the staircased approximation while 
describing the refractive index profiles (RIPs) 
of a step-index tilted waveguide under the 
 4
positioned in the direction parallel to the 
slanted waveguide as illustrated at right 
upper location in Fig. 1 and this leads 
to ( ) / 0n p q∂ ∂ = . Consequently, the 
staircased approximation is completely 
removed. Based on (3), we assume an optical 
field consisted of a slowly varying 
field ( , )p qφ and a fast-oscillating phase 
term 0 0exp( [ sec sin ])jk n q pθ θ− + as 
follows: 
0 0 ( sec sin )( , ) ( , ) jk n q py yE p q p q e
θ θφ − +=  (4) 
where 0n denotes the reference refractive 
index and 1j = − . It means that the optical 
filed is propagated along lines of constant p . 
Substituting (4) into (3) and neglecting the 
second derivative ofφ with respect to z , the 
Fresnel equation obtained under the 
consideration of OCS is given as shown 
below

operators A and B are expressed in the

In this work, our numerical scheme is based 
on (5) and (6). 
 
四、NUMERICAL SCHEME AND 
RESULTS 
 
According to the algorithm of 
multidomain SCM, the cross section of the 
tilted waveguide as illustrated in Fig. 1 is 
divided into three subdomains at the 
dielectric boundaries. In each subdomain, the 
dependent field ( )pφ is expanded by a 
suitable cardinal basis function [11] 
{ ( ), 0,1, 2,..., }jC p j N= and the unknown 
grid point values of 1N + collocation points

Here, )(1 pN +ψ denotes specific basis function

( 11 −≤≤ Nj ). Correspondingly, for 
semi-infinite subdomains, we take 
Laguerre-Gaussian functions, namely,

Substituting (7), (8) into (6) for each 
subdomain, we obtain the elements of the 
operators A and B as follows:

0 02 cos 2 tan ( ) |ij ij j p piA jk n C pθδ θ == +

0 0sec ( ) | ( ( ) )ij j p p i ijiB C p k n p nθ δ== + − .            
(11) 
In the above formulas, ijδ denotes the 
Kronecker delta, ( )njC denotes the n -th 
derivative of cardinal basis function of 
degree j with respect to p . In the present 
approach, the middle subdomain I with finite 
interval is expanded by Chebyshev 
polynomials and that ones II and III in outer 
subdomains with semi-infinite extension are 
expanded by Laguerre-Gaussian functions 
for expressing the decay characteristics in the 
cladding regions. The explicit forms of the 
basis functions have been in detail shown in 
[11]. The introduction of the OCS makes the 
determination of the spreading or scaling 
factor [9] simple at each propagation step 
and thus substantially reduces the 
computational size resembling to the 
FD-BPM [2]-[6]. The interfacial boundary

angle θ for the TE10. 
 
The results calculated by the proposed 
method are with respect to the conditions that 
the propagation step size is ∆q=1µm , the 
total number of basis functions is N=150 (i.e., 
each subdomain is expanded by 50 terms of 
basis functions), and the reference refractive 
index on =3.17675190586 is chosen from the 
effective refractive index of the TE10. The 
obvious difference for computational 
efficiency between our approach and other 
schemes can be seen via the two 
numbers zN and xN . The RPL computed by 
ELM and the present method at tilt angle of 
0o which are not illustrated in Fig. 2 are of 
the order 10-13 and 10-15, respectively. Our 
work obtains the highest accuracy regardless 
of tilt angles, and the RPL for the most tilt 
angle oθ=20 is far less than -20dB regarded as 
a good result in [13]. Moreover, for the 
waveguide structures in which the domain 
boundaries change along propagation 
distance, for example, a bend, the local OCS 
[15] can be adopted. The main notion of local 
OCS is to choose different θ in each 
longitudinal step to execute oblique 
coordinate transformation (2), and therefore a 
bent waveguide is considered as 
multisectional tilted waveguides with 
different tilt angle along propagation 
distance. 
 
五、CONCLUSION 
    A highly efficient and accurate beam 
propagation method using the multidomain 
spectral collocation scheme is presented. The 
present method developed is based on the 
oblique coordinate system. The boundary 
conditions of optical fields at infinity are 
implicitly satisfied by the decaying feature of 
Laguerre-Gaussian functions. Hence, no 
explicit window size is needed to assign and 
the additional expense for involving other 
boundary conditions such as PML, ABC, and 
TBC used in FD-BPM are avoided. We 
validate the performances by testing a tilted 
step-index waveguide and the relative power 
losses obtained by our work are the smallest 
for the tilt angle from 00 to 200. The present 
method is expected to further apply to more 
complicated and practical photonic 
integrated circuits of great interest. 
 
六、COMMENTS TO THE PROGRAM 
BY OURSELF 
We have developed a novel scheme 
pseudospectral beam propagation method 
with oblique coordinate system 
transformation to compute optical 
waveguides. The present approach 
effectively solves the staircase approximation 
to tilted waveguides tackled by finite 
difference and finite element methods and 
achieves extremely small power loss (<10-4, 
for the tilt angle of a tilted waveguide up 
to 020 ) but considerably save the 
computational resources. Our result is 
published in “IEEE Photonics Technology 
Letters”. Further applications to various 
devices such as Y-branch, bent, modulation, 
and directional coupler are in progress.
