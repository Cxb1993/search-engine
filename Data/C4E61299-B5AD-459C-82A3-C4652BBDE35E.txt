The duality theory for inexact linear programming problem was proposed by Soyster [31, 32, 33]
and Thuente [36]. Falk [11] provided some properties on this problem. However, Pomerol [25]
pointed out some drawbacks of Soyster’s results and also provided some mild conditions to improve
Soyster’s results.
The interval-valued optimization problems are closely related with the inexact linear program-
ming problems. Charnes et al. [8] considered the linear programming problems in which the right-
hand sides of linear inequality constraints were taken as closed intervals. Steuer [35] proposed three
algorithms, called the F-cone algorithm, E-cone algorithm and all emanating algorithm to solve the
linear programming problems with interval objective functions. Bitran [6] discussed the connected-
ness of the set of efficient extreme points and the existence of efficient points in the multiobjective
linear programming problems with interval coefficients, where an implicit enumeration algorithm
was also proposed to obtain the solutions. Ishibuchi and Tanaka [17] proposed the ordering relation
between two closed intervals by considering the maximization and minimization problems sepa-
rately. Inuiguchi and Kume [14] formulated and solved four kinds of goal programming problems
with interval coefficients in which the target values were also assumed as closed intervals. Inuiguchi
and Sakawa [16] introduced the concept of minimax regret solution and investigated its relation
to the possibly and necessarily optimal solutions. Mra´z [23] provided algorithms to compute the
exact upper and lower bounds of optimal solutions for linear programming problems with interval
coefficients. Chinneck and Ramadan [9] proposed an approach to find the best optimum and worst
optimum, and the point settings of the interval coefficients that can achieve these two extremes.
Sengupta et al. [28] proposed the A-index to compare two closed intervals and used it to define a
satisfactory crisp equivalent system of an inequality constraint with interval coefficients, where the
concept of satisfactory solution was also defined. Urli and Nadeau [37] used an interactive method
STEM to solve the multiobjective linear programming problems with interval coefficients, where
they also proposed a methodology to transform a nondeterministic problems into the deterministic
problems. Chanas and Kuchta [7] presented an approach to unify the solution methods proposed
by Ishibuchi and Tanaka [17] and Rommelfanger et al. [27]. Also the portfolio selection problem
with interval objective functions were investigated by Ida [13]. Recently, Oliveria and Antunes [24]
provided an overview of multiobjective linear programming problems with interval coefficients by
illustrating many numerical examples.
In this report, we provide many solution concepts for the multiobjective programming problem
with interval-valued objective functions. One of the solution concepts follows from Ishibuchi and
Tanaka [17]. Two ordering relationships between two closed intervals in R are proposed. We shall
see that these two orderings are not total orderings on the class of all closed intervals. Therefore,
we shall invoke the solution concept (Pareto optimal solution) in the (conventional) multiobjective
programming problems to deal with the multiobjective programming problems with interval-valued
objective functions. Under these settings, we are going to derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality
condition.
3 Research Methodology
Let Kc(R) denote the class of all nonempty, compact and convex subsets of R. Let A,B ∈ Kc(R).
Then A+B is defined by A+B = {a+b : a ∈ A and b ∈ B} and−A is defined by−A = {−a : a ∈ A}.
Therefore, A−B = A + (−B).
Let us denote by I the class of all closed intervals in R. If A is a closed interval, we also adopt
the notation A = [aL, aU ], where aL and aU means the lower and upper bounds of A, respectively.
Let A = [aL, aU ] and B = [bL, bU ] be in I. Then, by definition, we have
• A + B = {a + b : a ∈ A and b ∈ B} = [aL + bL, aU + bU ];
• −A = {−a : a ∈ A} = [−aU ,−aL].

if and only if
lim
x→c+ f
L(x) = aL and lim
x→c+ f
U (x) = aU ,
and
lim
x→c− f(x) = A
if and only if
lim
x→c− f
L(x) = aL and lim
x→c− f
U (x) = aU .
Let f be an interval-valued function defined on Rn. We say that f is continuous at c ∈ Rn if
lim
x→c f(x) = f(c).
Then we have f is continuous at c ∈ Rn if and only if fL and fU are continuous at c.
Now we shall consider the differentiation of interval-valued function. We firstly introduce a very
straightforward concept of differentiation.
Definition 3.1 Let X be an open set in R. An interval-valued function f : X → I with f(x) =
[fL(x), fU (x)] is called weakly differentiable at x0 if the real-valued functions fL and fU are differ-
entiable at x0 (in the usual sense).
Next we are going to propose another differentiation of interval-valued function. Let A,B ∈
Kc(R). If there exists C ∈ Kc(R) such that A = B + C, then C is called the Hukuhara difference.
We also write C = A	B (ref. Banks and Jacobs [3]). Now we consider the Hukuhara difference in
I. Let A = [aL, aU ] and B = [bL, bU ] be two closed intervals in R. If there exists a closed interval
C = [cL, cU ] such that A = B + C, then C is called the Hukuhara difference. Since A = B + C, it
is easy to see that aL = bL + cL and aU = bU + cU , i.e., cL = aL − bL and cU = aU − bU . Therefore,
this closed interval C exists if aL − bL ≤ aU − bU . In this case, C = [aL − bL, aU − bU ] and we
also write C = A	B. Therefore, when we say that the Hukuhara difference C = A	B exists, we
implicitly means that aL − bL ≤ aU − bU .
We remark that if A = [aL, aU ] is a closed interval in R and h is a positive real number, then A/h
is read as A/h = [aL/h, aU/h]. Now we are going to propose the differentiation of interval-valued
function by invoking the Hukuhara difference.
Definition 3.2 Let X be an open set in R. An interval-valued function f : X → I is called H-
differentiable (or strongly differentiable) at x0 if there exists a closed interval A(x0) (note that this
interval depends on x0) in R such that the limits
lim
h→0+
f(x0 + h)	 f(x0)
h
and lim
h→0+
f(x0)	 f(x0 − h)
h
both exist and are equal to A(x0). In this case, the closed interval A(x0) is called the H-derivative
of f at x0.
The following result shows that the strong differentiability implies the weak differentiability.
Proposition 3.1 Let X be an open set in R. If the interval-valued function f : X → I is H-
differentiable (or strongly differentiable) at x0 with H-derivative A(x0) = [aL(x0), aU (x0)], then f is
weakly differentiable at x0. Furthermore, we have (fL)′(x0) = aL(x0) and (fU )′(x0) = aU (x0).
Now we are going to consider the interval-valued function f defined on Rn, i.e., f(x) = f(x1, · · · , xn)
is an interval in R for each x = (x1, · · · , xn) ∈ Rn. Therefore, we also have the corresponding real-
valued functions fL(x) = fL(x1, · · · , xn) and fU (x) = fU (x1, · · · , xn) defined on Rn.
Let f be a real-valued function defined on Rn. Assume that one of the partial derivatives
∂f/∂x1, · · · , ∂f/∂xn exists at x0 and that the remaining n − 1 partial derivatives exist on some
neighborhoods of x0 and are continuous at x0. Then Apostol [2, Theorem 12.11] says that f is
differentiable at x0, which also motivates the following definition.
4
Now we write A ≺LU B if and only if A LU B and A 6= B. Equivalently, we see that A ≺LU B
if and only if {
aL < bL
aU ≤ bU or
{
aL ≤ bL
aU < bU
or
{
aL < bL
aU < bU
. (3)
We say that A = (A1, · · · , Ar) is an interval-valued vector if each component Ak = [aLk , aUk ] is a
closed interval for k = 1, · · · , r. Let A = (A1, · · · , Ar) and B = (B1, · · · , Br) be two interval-valued
vectors. We write A LU B if and only if Ak LU Bk for each k = 1, · · · , r, and A ≺LU B if and
only if Ak LU Bk for each k = 1, · · · , r and Ah ≺LU Bh for at least one index h. Let x∗ be a feasible
solution of problem (MIVP1). Then f(x∗) is an interval-valued vector. The different concepts of
Pareto optimal solution are proposed below.
Definition 3.4 Let x∗ be a feasible solution of problem (MIVP1).
(i) We say that x∗ is a type-I Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP1) if there exists no x¯ ∈ X
such that f(x¯) ≺LU f(x∗).
(ii) We say that x∗ is a strongly type-I Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP1) if there exists
no x¯ ∈ X such that f(x¯) LU f(x∗).
(iii) We say that x∗ is a weakly type-I Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP1) if there exists
no x¯ ∈ X such that fk(x¯) ≺LU fk(x∗) for all k = 1, · · · , r.
Next we are going to introduce another solution concept following from Ishibuchi and Tanaka
[17]. Let A = [aL, aU ] be a closed interval in R. Then we can calculate the center aC = 12 (a
L + aU )
and the half-width aW = 12 (a
U − aL) of A. In this case, we can use the new notation 〈aC , aW 〉 to
denote the closed interval A, i.e., we write A = 〈aC , aW 〉. Let A = 〈aC , aW 〉 and B = 〈bC , bW 〉 be
two closed intervals. Ishibuchi and Tanaka [17] proposed the ordering relation between A and B by
considering the maximization and minimization problems separately.
(i) For maximization, we write
A CW B if and only if aC ≤ bC and aW ≥ bW .
The half-width of interval can be regarded as uncertainty. Therefore, the interval with higher center
and lower half-width (i.e., the less uncertainty) is preferred for maximization problem.
(ii) For minimization, we write
A CW B if and only if aC ≤ bC and aW ≤ bW .
The interval with lower center and lower half-width (i.e., the less uncertainty) is preferred for mini-
mization problem.
In this report, we shall consider the minimization problem. We also write A ≺CW B if and
only if A CW B and A 6= B. Let A = (A1, · · · , Ar) and B = (B1, · · · , Br) be two interval-valued
vectors. We write A CW B if and only if Ak CW Bk for each k = 1, · · · , r, and A ≺CW B if and
only if Ak CW Bk for each k = 1, · · · , r and Ah ≺CW Bh for at least one index h.
Definition 3.5 Let x∗ be a feasible solution of problem (MIVP1).
(i) We say that x∗ is a type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP1) if there exists no x¯ ∈ X
such that f(x¯) ≺CW f(x∗).
(ii) We say that x∗ is a strongly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP1) if there exists
no x¯ ∈ X such that f(x¯) CW f(x∗).
(iii) We say that x∗ is a weakly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP1) if there exists
no x¯ ∈ X such that fk(x¯) ≺CW fk(x∗) for all k = 1, · · · , r.

Now we are in a position to present the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition for problem (MIVP2).
Theorem 4.2 Assume that the real-valued constraint functions gi : Rn → R are convex on Rn and
continuously differentiable at x∗ for i = 1, · · · ,m. Let X = {x ∈ Rn : gi(x) ≤ 0, i = 1, · · · ,m} be the
feasible set and x∗ ∈ X. Assume that fk : Rn → I are weakly continuously differentiable at x∗ for
k = 1, · · · , r. Then the following statements hold true.
(A) Suppose that the interval-valued objective functions fk : Rn → I are LU-convex at x∗ for
k = 1, · · · , r. If there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 < λLk , λUk ∈ R, k = 1, · · · , r and 0 ≤ µi ∈ R,
i = 1, · · · ,m, such that

k∇fUk (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0;
(ii) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a type-I Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
(B) Suppose that the interval-valued objective functions fk : Rn → I are CW-convex at x∗ for k =
1, · · · , r. If there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 < λCk , λWk ∈ R, k = 1, · · · , r and 0 ≤ µi ∈ R,
i = 1, · · · ,m, such that

k ∇fWk (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0;
(iv) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
(C) Suppose that the interval-valued objective functions fk : Rn → I are CW-convex at x∗ for
k = 1, · · · , r. If there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 < λLk , λUk ∈ R, k = 1, · · · , r and 0 ≤ µi ∈ R,
i = 1, · · · ,m, such that
(v) λLk < λ

k∇fUk (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0;
(vii) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
In the sequel, we are going to relax the convexity assumption of interval-valued objective function
by considering the pseudoconvexity. Let X be a nonempty feasible set and x∗ ∈ cl X (the closure
of X). The cone of feasible directions of X at x∗, denoted by D, is defined by
D = {d ∈ Rn : d 6= 0, there exists a δ > 0 such that x∗ + ηd ∈ X for all η ∈ (0, δ)}.
Each d of D is called a feasible direction of X. The following proposition, from Bazaraa et al. [4],
is very useful.
Proposition 4.2 (Bazaraa et al. [4, Lemma 4.2.4]) Let X = {x ∈ Rn : gi(x) ≤ 0, i = 1, · · · ,m} be
a feasible set and a point x∗ ∈ X. Assume that gi are differentiable at x∗ for all i = 1, · · · ,m. Let
I = {i : gi(x∗) = 0} be the index set for the active constraints. Then
D ⊆ {d ∈ Rn : ∇gi(x∗)Td ≤ 0 for each i ∈ I}
(note that this proposition still hold true if we just assume that gi are continuous at x∗ instead of
differentiable at x∗ for i 6∈ I).
Let us recall that f is pseudoconvex at x∗ if f(x) < f(x∗) then ∇f(x∗)T (x−x∗) < 0 for x ∈ X,
and f is strictly pseudoconvex at x∗ if f(x) ≤ f(x∗) then ∇f(x∗)T (x − x∗) < 0 for x ∈ X. It is
well-known that the strict convexity implies the strict pseudoconvexity. Therefore we propose the
following definition.
8
(B) Suppose that there is an interval-valued objective function, say the hth interval-valued objective
function fh : Rn → I, such that it is CW-convex and weakly continuously differentiable at
x∗ for k = 1, · · · , r. If there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 < λC , λW ∈ R, and 0 ≤ µi ∈ R,
i = 1, · · · ,m, such that
(iii) λC∇fCh (x∗) + λW∇fWh (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0;
(iv) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a weakly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
(C) Suppose that there is an interval-valued objective function, say the hth interval-valued objective
function fh : Rn → I, such that it is CW-convex and weakly continuously differentiable at
x∗ for k = 1, · · · , r. If there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 < λL, λU ∈ R, and 0 ≤ µi ∈ R,
i = 1, · · · ,m, such that
(v) λL < λU ;
(vi) λL∇fLh (x∗) + λU∇fUh (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0;
(vii) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a weakly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
Now we are going to present some KKT conditions for strongly type-I and type-II solutions. We
need some concepts of pseudoconvexity for the interval-valued functions.
Definition 4.3 Let f(x) = [fL(x), fU (x)] = 〈fC(x), fW (x)〉 be an interval-valued function defined
on a nonempty convex subset X ⊆ Rn. We say that f is strictly L-pseudoconvex at x∗ if and only
if fL is strictly pseudoconvex at x∗. We can similarly define the strictly U-pseudoconvex, strictly
C-pseudoconvex and strictly W-pseudoconvex at x∗ by considering fU , fC and fW , respectively.
We see that, by definition, f is strictly LU-pseudoconvex at x∗ if and only if f is strictly L- and
U-pseudoconvex at x∗, and f is strictly CW-pseudoconvex at x∗ if and only if f is strictly C- and
W-pseudoconvex at x∗.
Theorem 4.5 Assume that the real-valued constraint functions gi : Rn → R are convex on Rn and
continuously differentiable at x∗ for i = 1, · · · ,m. Let X = {x ∈ Rn : gi(x) ≤ 0, i = 1, · · · ,m} be the
feasible set and x∗ ∈ X. Then the following statements hold true.
(A) Suppose that there is an interval-valued objective function, say the hth interval-valued objective
function fh : Rn → I, such that it is strictly L-pseudoconvex (resp. strictly U-pseudoconvex)
and weakly continuously differentiable at x∗. If there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 ≤ µi ∈ R,
i = 1, · · · ,m, such that
(i) ∇fLh (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0 (resp. ∇fUh (x∗) +
∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0);
(ii) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a strongly type-I Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).

i = 1, · · · ,m, such that
(iii) ∇fCh (x∗) +

∑m
i=1 µi∇gi(x∗) = 0);
(iv) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a strongly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
10
(ii) We say that f is LU-decreasing (resp. CW-decreasing) at x∗ if x > x∗ if and only if f(x) ≺LU
f(x∗) (resp. f(x) ≺CW f(x∗)) for x ∈ X.
Theorem 4.6 Assume that the real-valued constraint functions gi : Rn → R are convex on Rn and
continuously differentiable at x∗ for i = 1, · · · ,m. Let X = {x ∈ Rn : gi(x) ≤ 0, i = 1, · · · ,m} be the
feasible set and x∗ ∈ X. Then the following statements hold true.
(A) Suppose that there is an interval-valued objective function, say the hth interval-valued objective
function fh : Rn → I, such that it is one-to-one and LU-decreasing, and it is also U-convex
and continuously H-differentiable at x∗. Let us further assume that ∇fLh (x∗) 6= ∇fUh (x∗). If
there exist (Lagrange) multipliers 0 ≤ µi ∈ R, i = 1, · · · ,m, such that

(iv) µigi(x∗) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · ,m,
then x∗ is a strongly type-II Pareto optimal solution of problem (MIVP2).
Theorem 4.7 Assume that the real-valued constraint functions gi : Rn → R are convex on Rn and
continuously differentiable at x∗ for i = 1, · · · ,m. Let X = {x ∈ Rn : gi(x) ≤ 0, i = 1, · · · ,m} be the
