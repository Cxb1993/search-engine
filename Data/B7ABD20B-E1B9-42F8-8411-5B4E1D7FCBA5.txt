investigation and modeling of sub-50nm
multiple-gate SOI CMOS. We have

nanowire MOSFETs to process variations

二、計畫目的及研究方法
As the semiconductor industry is
confronted with the difficulty of downsizing
the transistor dimension, multiple-gate SOI is
emerging as an important device structure for
CMOS scaling [1].
In this two-year project, we have
conducted investigation and modeling for sub-
50nm multiple-gate SOI CMOS. This report
describes two main tasks in this year:
Task I: Investigation of Variability for
Gate-All-Around Nanowire MOSFETs –A
Comparison with Multi-Gate MOSFETs
Task II: A Comprehensive Study of
Single-Electron Effects in Multiple-Gate
MOSFETs
Task I
Due to their better gate control, multi-
gate structure [1][2] and Gate-All-Around
(GAA) nanowire (NW) [3][4] are considered
as important candidates for the future CMOS
scaling. The GAA NW features the
surrounding gate channel, which is an ideal
structure to provide better gate control.
However, with the scaling of device geometry,
the impact of process variations has become a
crucial issue to device design. Although GAA
NW is a promising alternative for future
device scaling, its immunity to process
variations remains an important question. J.
Wang et al. [5] suggested that the NW
3To assess the sensitivity of GAA NW and
multi-gate MOSFETs to process variations, we
assume that the device parameters such as
channel length (Leff), channel diameter (D) of
GAA NW, and fin width (Wfin) of multi-gate
MOSFETs vary by ±2.5nm (±3σ value, σ is 
the standard deviation) [1]. This 3σ value is 
estimated from the combination of process
variations such as lithography variation, etch
variation, and resist trim variation [1]. In
addition, the impact of dopant number
fluctuation is crucial to Vth variation of heavily
doped devices. In this work, we assess the Vth
sensitivity to dopant number fluctuation using
our analytical Vth model. We assume that the
channel dopant number follows the Poisson
distribution [22] and the σ of the dopant 
number is na1/2, where na is the average dopant
number in the Si-channel. The corresponding
Vth variation for process variations and dopant
number fluctuation can be calculated asΔVth =
[ Vth(+3σ)－ Vth(－3σ) ] /2 [22].
To compare the GAA NW with multi-gate
MOSFETs, the total width (Wtotal) of GAA
NW (Wtotal = π∙D) and multi-gate MOSFETs
(Wtotal = 2Hfin + Wfin) are equal to make fair
comparison. Multi-gate structures with various
ARs (AR = Hfin /Wfin) are considered,
including FinFET (AR = 2) and Tri-gate (AR
= 1) [8]. Devices with various channel doping
are considered in this study. For heavily doped
devices, the channel doping is equal to
6×1018cm-3. For lightly doped devices, the
channel doping is equal to 1×1017cm-3. Besides,
gate oxide (tox = 1nm) is used for heavily
doped devices, while high k dielectric (tHfO2 =
2nm and the dielectric constant of HfO2 is 25)
is used for lightly doped ones to sustain the
device electrostatics [1].
Fig. 3 shows the calculated ΔVth caused
by dopant number fluctuation (ΔVth,RDF) for
Wtotal = 75nm and Leff = 25nm, and the results
are verified with device simulation [21]. The
ΔVth,RDF for GAA NW is larger than that of
multi-gate MOSFETs. This is because for a
given total width, GAA NW possesses smaller
channel volume than FinFET and Tri-gate.
Besides, it can be seen that for heavily doped
channel, the ΔVth,RDF is significantly larger
than that of lightly doped ones. The Vth
dispersion due to dopant number fluctuation is
a crucial concern for heavily doped device
design.
Fig. 4 shows the calculated ΔVth caused
by Leff variation (ΔVth,Leff) for Wtotal = 75nm
and Leff = 25nm. The discrepancies of ΔVth,Leff
for heavily doped devices are not significant.
For lightly doped channel, the ΔVth,Leff of
GAA NW is also close to that of FinFET.
However, the ΔVth,Leff of GAA NW is much
smaller that that of Tri-gate. The ΔVth,Leff is
determined by the Vth roll-off characteristics.
Fig. 5(a) demonstrates that for heavily doped
channel, the Vth roll-off of the three devices
are similar because channel doping reduces the
geometry dependence of electrostatic integrity.
In Fig. 5(b), the Vth roll-off of lightly doped
GAA MOSFET is close to that of lightly
doped FinFET.
Fig. 6 shows the calculated ΔVth caused
by channel thickness (tsi) variation (ΔVth,tsi) for
Wtotal = 75nm and Leff = 25nm. Wfin variation
and Diameter variation are considered for
multi-gate MOSFETs and GAA NW,
respectively. It can be seen that for lightly
doped channel, the ΔVth,tsi of GAA NW is
smaller than that of multi-gate MOSFETs.
This is because the surrounding gate structure
of GAA NW reduces the channel thickness
dependence of Vth. Fig. 7 shows that the GAA
structure with a square cross section (which
possesses the same channel volume as
cylindrical GAA structure) shows similar Vth
sensitivity (dVth / dWfin) as that (dVth / dD) of
the cylindrical GAA structure. Although
multi-gate structures with higher AR can be
used to improve the immunity to Wfin variation,
Fig. 8 shows that with the scaling of Wtotal, the
ΔVth,tsi of GAA NW decreases more rapidly
than that of FinFET.
To assess the overall Vth variation
(ΔVth,total) for GAA NW and multi-gate
5gG CeeV /)/)(/1(   (1)
where α= Cg /CΣ, and CΣ= Cg+Cd+Cs. The
quantum energy levels can also result in
additional conductance oscillations [12][15].
As shown in Fig. 15, when the energy of
carriers ≥Ec (e2/CΣ) + 2Δε, the first excited
state for the (n+1)th electron is available and
thus Gds increases. Such conductance
oscillations outside the CBO regime can
explain the“fine structure”observed in Fig. 12
and Fig. 14. It is worth noticing that the first
term in (1), (1/α)(Δε/e), is near the period of
the fine structure.
For T = 56 K and VDS = 0.2 mV (Fig.
14(b)), the fine structure is clear and
responsible for the 4.3-mV period in Fig. 14(c).
From <ΔVG> = 11.7 mV and (1/α)(Δε/e) = 4.3
mV, we can deduce Cg ~ 21.6 aF and Aeff ~
16.2×10-12 cm2, which is much closer to the
expected total gate area 24×10-12 cm2. For T =
293 K and VDS = 2 mV (Fig. 14(a)), however,
the fine structure smears out. From Cg ~ 21.6
aF and <ΔVG> = 16.1 mV, we can deduce
(1/α)(Δε/e) ~ 8.7 mV.
To determine the αof the SET, Coulomb
blockade rhombus diagram can be used. The
slopes of the rhombus boundaries are given by
Cg/(Cg+Cs) and–Cg/Cd, respectively. From Fig.
16 and Fig. 17, we obtain Cg:Cd:Cs = 9:16:13
for the device with Lg = 30 nm and Wfin = 25
nm and Cg:Cd:Cs = 11:9:9 for the device with
Lg = 40 nm and Wfin = 25 nm. The gate-dot
coupling strength in our device is about 0.3 for
T = 293 K.
When the Wfin of multiple-gate devices
reduces, not only the gate-dot coupling
strength but also the access resistances
(source/drain resistance) increase. Clear CBO
and the fine structure at T = 293 K for the
device with Wfin = 15 nm and Lg = 40 nm in
Fig. 18 are the evidence. From <ΔVG> = 10
mV and (1/α)(Δε/e) = 4.6 mV, we can deduce
Cg ~ 29.6 aF and Aeff ~ 22.3×10-12 cm2. It is
worth noticing that the extracted values of Cg
are linearly proportional to Lg (Fig. 19).
In conclusion, we have conducted an in-
depth study of single-electron effects in
multiple-gate SOI MOSFETs. The impact of
quantum mechanical effects on Coulomb
blockade oscillations has been investigated.
Our study indicates that, to enable room-
temperature SET applications, raising the gate-
dot coupling strength and the access resistance
are crucial. The multiple-gate SOI MOSFET
with the non-overlapped architecture is an
attractive approach for future SETs.

會議名稱 2008 Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop
發表論文題目 A Comprehensive Study of Single-Electron Effects in Multiple-Gate MOSFETs
一、參加會議經過
Silicon Nanoelectronics Workshop is one of the major international conferences in the
area of nanoelectronics, bridging between the mainstream CMOS technology and the Si-based
nanotechnology. This is the 13th workshop in series. The program includes 5 invited talks, 36
oral presentations, and 72 poster presentations. Our group has 1 oral presentation.
二、與會心得
The conference has 5 oral sessions: 1. MOSFETs; 2. SETs and QDs; 3. Nanowires; 4.
Novel Structures, Materials, and Processing; 5. Memories. These sessions have covered recent
research trend in the topics such as Si-based novel FET architecture including vertical and
multiple-gate devices and novel channel materials; Device physics of Si-based nanodevices
including quantum effects, nonequilibrium and ballistic transport; Si-based nanoscale device
modeling and simulation including atomistic effects; Extreme processing of Si-based
nanostructures, etc.
Our paper:“A Comprehensive Study of Single-Electron Effects in Multiple-Gate
MOSFETs,”was arranged as the first presented paper in the session of SETs and QDs on the
first day of the conference. Our paper reported an in-depth study of single-electron effects in
multiple-gate SOI MOSFETs. Especially, we have investigated the impact of quantum
mechanical effects on Coulomb blockade oscillations. Our study indicated that, to enable
room-temperature SET applications, raising the gate-dot coupling strength and the access
resistance will be crucial. We also concluded that the multi-gate SOI MOSFET with the
non-overlapped architecture will be an attractive approach for future SETs. Our paper brought
up several discussions after the presentation.
From the presentations in the MOSFETs session, we can notice the growing importance in
the research of alternative channel materials to further enhance the nanoscale transistor
performance. In fact, we have recently conducted research regarding this topic and our paper:
“Investigation of Electrostatic Integrity for Ultra-Thin-Body GeOI MOSFET Using Analytical
Solution of Poisson’s Equation,” will be oral-presented at the 2008 IEEE International
A Comprehensive Study of Single-Electron Effects in Multiple-Gate MOSFETs

1. Introduction
Single electron transistor (SET) is a promising candidate
for ultralow-power and ultrahigh-density circuit systems in
the next generation [1,2]. Especially, the SET with standard
silicon nanoelectronics process and compatible with existing
CMOS device architectures is very attractive. Since
multiple-gate SOI MOSFETs are considered as a promising
candidate for ultra-scaled CMOS, we have reported
controlled single electron effects in these devices at room
temperature [3,4].
In this work, we further investigate the impact of
quantum mechanical effects on the Coulomb blockade
oscillations [5,6]. Moreover, the role of access resistances [7]
and the gate-dot coupling strength [8] are assessed for
devices with various gate length (Lg) and fin-width (Wfin).
We provide a comprehensive study of single-electron effects
in multi-gate MOSFETs.
2. Devices
For the multi-gate FinFET shown in Fig. 1(a), the main
feature is the non-overlapped regions (Fig. 1(b)) that act as
the electrostatic tunnel barriers of the single-electron
tunneling [9]. Two dots are defined in the separated
inversion channels (Fig. 1(c)).
3. Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the periodic oscillations, an indication of
the Coulomb blockade oscillations (CBO), in the Gm-VG
characteristics of the device with Lg = 30 nm and Wfin = 25
nm. Also shown in Fig. 2 is that the conductance of the
channel (Gds) is on the same order of magnitude as e
2/h,
which is a criterion for CBO [7]. The oscillations are
reproducible at different temperatures and the oscillating
components, Gm-<Gm>, are presented in Fig. 3. A 17-mV
period <ΔVG> is confirmed by the discrete Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) (Fig. 4(a)) and the histogram of the directly
counted peak-to-peak spacing (ΔVG) (Fig. 4(b)). From
<ΔVG> = e/Cg and the gate capacitance per unit area Cg/Aeff
(= εSiO2/EOT ~ 1.33×10-6 F/cm2), we can deduce an effective
area of the device, Aeff ~ 7.1×10
-12 cm2, which is about a
factor of 3 smaller than the total gate area of our FinFET
device (2HfinLg = 24×10
-12 cm2). Besides uncertainties of
process control in very small geometries, the discrepancy
may stem mainly from the impact of quantum mechanical
effects, in which the quantized energy spacing Δεaccounts
for a portion of the period of CBO as [1]
gG CeeV /)/)(/1(   (1)
where α= Cg /CΣ, and CΣ= Cg+Cd+Cs. The quantum energy
levels can also result in additional conductance oscillations
[2][5]. As shown in Fig. 6, when the energy of carriers ≥Ec
(e2/CΣ) + 2Δε, the first excited state for the (n+1)th electron
is available and thus Gds increases. Such conductance
oscillations outside the CBO regime can explain the “fine
structure”observed in Fig. 3 and Fig. 5. It is worth noticing
that the first term in (1), (1/α)(Δε/e), is near the period of the
fine structure.
For T = 56 K and VDS = 0.2 mV (Fig. 5(b)), the fine
structure is clear and responsible for the 4.3-mV period in
Fig. 5(c). From <ΔVG> = 11.7 mV and (1/α)(Δε/e) = 4.3 mV,
we can deduce Cg ~ 21.6 aF and Aeff ~ 16.2×10
-12 cm2, which
is much closer to the expected total gate area 24×10-12 cm2.
For T = 293 K and VDS = 2 mV (Fig. 5(a)), however, the fine
structure smears out. From Cg ~ 21.6 aF and <ΔVG> = 16.1
mV, we can deduce (1/α)(Δε/e) ~ 8.7 mV.
To determine the αof the SET, Coulomb blockade
rhombus diagram can be used. The slopes of the rhombus
boundaries are given by Cg/(Cg+Cs) and–Cg/Cd, respectively.
From Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, we obtain Cg:Cd:Cs = 9:16:13 for the
device with Lg = 30 nm and Wfin = 25 nm and Cg:Cd:Cs =
11:9:9 for the device with Lg = 40 nm and Wfin = 25 nm. The
gate-dot coupling strength in our device is about 0.3 for T =
293 K.
When the Wfin of multiple-gate devices reduces, not only
the gate-dot coupling strength but also the access resistances
(source/drain resistance) increase. Clear CBO and the fine
structure at T = 293 K for the device with Wfin = 15 nm and
Lg = 40 nm in Fig. 9 are the evidence. From <ΔVG> = 10
mV and (1/α)(Δε/e) = 4.6 mV, we can deduce Cg ~ 29.6 aF
and Aeff ~ 22.3×10
-12 cm2. It is worth noticing that the
extracted values of Cg are linearly proportional to Lg (Fig.
10).
4. Conclusion
We have conducted an in-depth study of single-electron
effects in multiple-gate SOI MOSFETs. The impact of
quantum mechanical effects on Coulomb blockade
oscillations has been investigated. Our study indicates that,
to enable room-temperature SET applications, raising the
gate-dot coupling strength and the access resistance are
crucial. The multiple-gate SOI MOSFET with the
non-overlapped architecture is an attractive approach for
future SETs.
