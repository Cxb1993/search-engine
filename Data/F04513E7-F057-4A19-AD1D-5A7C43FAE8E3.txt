the monomer density as a function of the 
distance from the grafting plane. The brush 
height and the segment density profile in a 
good solvent have been experimentally 
studied using neutron reflectometry [1-4]. 
Another significant property is the 
interaction between two plates grafted with 
polymer brushes, which has been directly 
measured by a surface force apparatus (SFA) 
[5-7] and an atomic force microscope (AFM) 
[8-10].  
Alexander and de Gennes [11,12] 
adopted scaling arguments and assumed the 
monomer density to be constant throughout 
the brush, i.e. the step-function profile. This 
assumption is valid only for very dense 
brushes, where the chains are nearly 
completely extended. Milner et al. [13] used 
the self-consistent-field (SCF) model and 
demonstrated that the monomer density 
decreases parabolically from a finite value at 
the grafting plane to zero at the edge of the 
brush. Experimental results show that the 
step function profile is not adequate to 
describe the inner structure of the brush and 
the tail of the experimental profile is 
smoother than the parabolic one [4]. 
Molecular dynamics studies have also 
demonstrated that an extended tail region is 
present at the edge of the brush, in which the 
density smoothly decays towards zero [14]. 
Molecular dynamic simulations of this 
problem have the distinct advantage of being 
able to describe the details of the brush 
conformation more accurately; for example, 
considering fluctuation effects under 
different compressions. Besides this, one 
can prepare absolutely well controlled 
surfaces, uncontrolled effects such as 
mesoscopic substrate surface roughness, 
adsorbed ions, or other impurities attached 
to the surface are absent. The interaction 
potential between substrate atoms and the 
monomers of the polymer chain can be 
chosen at will and is precisely known.    
The purpose of this study is to present an 
effective method for a statistical analysis of 
the interaction formed between two parallel 
surfaces grafted with the same polymer 
brushes in a good solvent. The 
interdigitation effect of the polymer brushes 
due to the compression of these two parallel 
plates is not considered in the present study. 
Based on the simulations of molecular 
dynamics for end-grafted polymer brushes, 
the behavior of the brush conformation 
involving the fluctuation effect under 
different compressions can be realized. The 
probability density function of brush heights 
is obtained to be a non-Gaussian distribution 
varying with the height measured from the 
grafting surface. The interaction forces 
based on the AdG model [11,12],  the 
MWC model [13], and the present model are 
presented for comparison. By combining the 
probability density function with the free 
energy of a single brush, the interaction free 
energy in a unit area between the two 
parallel plates grafted with polymer brushes 
is evaluated theoretically. The force formed 
between two cylindrical surfaces is then 
obtained by applying the Derjaguin 
approximation to the interaction free energy 
formed between two parallel surfaces [15]. 
The results predicted by the AdG and MWC 
models and the present model are presented 
to compare them with the experimental 
forces which were presented in the study of 
the interaction force of the PS-X 
(X:-N(CH3)2) brushes grafted on mica 
 4
is the equilibrium brush thickness in the 
present model. The assumption of a uniform 
concentration density is not appropriate to 
describe the brush conformation because it 
restricts the chains in two aspects. First, all 
chains are constrained to exhibit the same 
behavior. Second, all chains are grouped 
together, the fluctuations of a chain far away 
from its most likely path are suppressed. 
Therefore, the conformation of polymer 
brushes should be considered individually. 
A method is presented for a statistical 
analysis of compressed polymer brushes. 
For each polymer brush, the interaction 
force     can be derived by differentiating 
Eq. (5) with respect to z . It is expressed as:

(6) 
where A  represents the missing prefactor 
in Eq. (5). The probability density function 
for brush heights denoted by     defines 
the probability of locating the free end 
monomers at a height of z . This function 
can be obtained from the simulations of 
molecular dynamics which are discussed in 
the next section. In the present study, the 
heights of all polymer brushes satisfy the 
distribution function     which is varied 
with different compression forces. The 
probability that a polymer brush has a height 
between z  and z dz+  is     . The 
interaction force formed in a unit area 
between two parallel plates with a separation 
h  is expressed as:

The prefactor A  in Eq. (6) can be 
determined by setting     . The 
relationship between   and   is illustrated 
in the discussion section. This raises the 
question of how to express the compression 
between two parallel plates all grafted with 
polymer brushes at a separation D . 
Assuming no interdigitation during the 
compression of these two parallel plates, the 
free energy of two brushes compressed 
against each other is approximately equal to 
twice the free energy of a single brush 
whose height is imposed to be / 2h D= .

function for brush heights is developed from 
the conformations of polymer brushes using 
molecular dynamics (MD). The simulation 
details are presented in the next section. 
2.3. Simulation details of end-grafted 
polymer brushes 
In order to investigate the details of the 
polymer chain conformation at different 
separations, molecular dynamics is applied 
to simulate the behavior of end-grafted 
polymer brushes. A simulation model for 
polymer chains is employed, which has 
already been applied in a previous study for 
similar purposes [17]. The equation of 
motion for monomer i  is given by:

steps. A frequency of 1000 steps was taken 
as a record to build the statistics for the 
brush conformation. The total computational 
time was much longer than the longest 
relaxation time of an individual chain in 
order to achieve the proper average 
conformation. 
2.4. Determination of the brush height 
probability density function 
The molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulation was started with the two plates at 
a separation h , which is much greater than 
the uncompressed brush thickness. In the 
entire monomer density profile, the 
maximum extent of brushes, maxh , in the 
present study is equal to a distance measured 
from the grafting plate to the height at which 
the monomer density becomes zero. Then 
the simulations began at a separation of 
maxh h= and the force between the two plates 
was calculated. The force almost dropped to 
zero when the equilibrium thickness (    ) 
of the brushes satisfied       . The 
simulations started from   and continued 
with h  being reduced by a very small 
amount. The conformations were taken as 
the initial condition for the subsequent 
longer runs. Finally, the simulations were 
terminated after being compressed to the 
maximum value       . The 
conformations of polymer brushes collected 
from the last twenty simulation records of 
each run were used to determine the brush 
height probability density function. The 
probability density function of brush heights 
was obtained using the nonparametric kernel 
smoothing method [21]. 
 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Fig. 1 shows three distributions of the 
monomer density (the number of monomers 
per unit volume)      obtained using the 
MD simulations applied in the present 
model, the AdG model, and the MWC 
model. The results predicted using the 
present model, the AdG model, and the 
MWC model are denoted by a solid line, a 
dashed line, and a broken line, respectively. 
The results of the present model were 
obtained at a separation of 60h σ= . This 
separation is much larger than the thickness 
of the uncompressed brushes if N  is set at 
a value of 50. The simulation results indicate 
that                  . A relationship of          
was obtained from the parabolic 
dashed curve predicted by the MWC model, 
where mL  represents the equilibrium brush 
thickness defined in the MWC model. Since 
a simple relationship of 01.3mL L=  had 
been derived in the study of Milner et al. 
[13], a relationship of          is 
obtained. This relationship is used to 
calculate the interaction force      shown 
in Eq. (7), and its validity was examined by 
the value 0L  defined in Eq. (4). By the 
simulations adopted in the present study, the 
monomer size a  corresponding to the 
average bonding length between two 
adjacent beads along a chain was found to 
be 0.95σ . Substituting 50N = , 0.03aρ = , 
and 0.95a σ=  into Eq. (4) obtains 
0 14.26 0.58 24.5L σ σ≈ ≈ × . Then, the 
relationship        predicted by the 
present model is confirmed. The 
Alexander-de Gennes model (the AdG 
model) assumed a step-function profile for 
the       parameter [11,12]. The model of

z  is normalized by the equilibrium 
thickness of the brush,   . At equilibration 
(         ), the probability density 
function is approximately a Gaussian 
distribution which is symmetrical with 
respect to the surface placed midway 
between the grafting surface and the upper 
surface. This characteristic implies that there 
is no compression and that chains show 
large fluctuations in the conformation. When 
a small compression is applied 
(          ), the distribution is skewed 
towards the compressed surface. This means 
that the compression has manifested but is 
still insignificant. Both the skewness and 
kurtosis of the     profile are enhanced by 
decreasing the      value or increasing the 
compression force. At a further compression 
of          , the      profile becomes 
sharp and high, with a peak near the upper 
surface. This behavior indicates that most of 
the brushes stretching out from the grafting 
surface are pressed against the upper surface 
such that a flat surface full of high-density 
brush ends is formed. 
   In the present study, two models which 
can predict the interaction force between 
two parallel plates grafted with polymer 
brushes are presented to compare their 
results with that of the present model. The 
AdG model, developed for the interaction 
force formed in a unit area with a separation 
D  between two parallel surfaces, is given

where R  denotes the radius of curvature of

and s  is the average distance between two

Kenworthy et al. [24] used the MWC model 
to express the interaction force between the 
grafted PEO chains as a function of surface 
separation, D . The force formed in a unit

osmotic repulsion, and the results predicted 
by all these three models are in an excellent 
agreement with the experimental data. In the 
small compression region of 60D nm> , the 
results predicted by the present model fit the 
experimental results much better than those 
of the other two models. The AdG and 
MWC models underestimated the forces. 
The large fluctuation effect in the brush 
conformation is the main cause of different 
interaction forces forming in these three 
models. This effect has been considered in 
the present model. Small compressions are 
generally important in applications such as 
colloidal stabilization. In this region, the 
force is quite small and is hard to detect due 
to the limitation in the instrument resolution. 
The experimental data of /F R , shown 
in Fig. 7, was obtained from the interaction 
force measurements for the Pluronic F108 
adsorbed on the n-HApp material. They 
were obtained in the study of McLean et al. 
[10] by using an atomic force microscope 
(AFM). Pluronic F108 adsorbed on the 
n-HApp material was proved to be the 
formation site of polymer brushes. It is 
necessary to take the fully compressed layer 
thickness as an offset in the evaluations of 
/F R  as a function of D . The offset shifts 
the experimental force profile to the right, 
thus increasing the experimental layer 
thickness at the same separation by this 
amount. In Fig. 7, the mean spacing between 
two adjacent grafting points of 3.75s nm=  
and an equilibrium brush thickness of 
8.7eL nm=  were used. The experimental 
data can be seen scattering over a wide band 
area if the interaction forces are measured at 
separations greater than about 13nm . The 
broad distribution of the experimental data is 
attributable to the hysteresis effect that 
arises during sequential runs of the same 
experiment [27]. The theoretical results 
predicted by these three models are also 
presented to compare them to the 
experimental data. In the subregion of 
10D nm≤ , the experimental data is quite 
close to the predictions of these three 
models. In the subregion of 10D nm> , 
most of the experimental data is 
concentrated on one side of the three curves, 
with the theoretical results of the present 
model being the closest to the experimental 
data. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 indicate that the 
present model can provide more accurate 
predictions of the interaction force than the 
other two models because of a significant 
improvement in the fluctuation effect 
formed in the brush conformation. 
 
4. Conclusions 
1. A slight depletion in the vicinity of the 
grafting surface is formed due to the 
repulsion between polymers and the surface. 
The large fluctuation effect in the brush 
conformation of the brushes with a finite 
length tends to increase the monomer 
density at the outer extremity of the brushes. 
They cause differences in the monomer 
density distribution     present at the 
regions of small     values near the 
grafting surface and large      values near 
the edge of the brush among the present, 
AdG, and MWC models. 
2. Non-Gaussian probability density 
function of brush heights varying with the 
surface separation can be achieved in the 
present model. It is the main cause of the 
significant differences in the interaction 
force at small compressions among these
