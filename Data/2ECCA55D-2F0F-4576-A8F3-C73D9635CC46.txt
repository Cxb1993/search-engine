Mining Control Rules for a Nano-Particle Milling Process Parameters by Using 
Fuzzy Decision Tree and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms 
 
Abstract 
Using mechanical milling process to make nano-particles is a popular method because of 
its simplicity and the applicability to all classes of materials. The smaller grain size the 
nano-particle is, the higher performance of surface area the nano-particle has. Therefore, the 
required qualities of the milling process are that the mean of nano-particle grain size and the 
variance of grain size must be kept small. However, many process parameters and 
corresponding quality measures are stored in a huge database and remain unknown. This 
database certainly contains many useful know-how rules that can be extracted by using data 
mining techniques to set and tune the process parameters and to improve the efficiency and 
quality in a nano-particle milling process. 
 
In this research, the data mining techniques, variable precision rough set (VPRS) and 
decision tree C5.0 algorithm, are respectively integrated with fuzzy set theory to extract the 
useful rules from a history quantitative database and to set the parameters for the 
corresponding multiple quality criteria in a nano-particle milling process. First of all, the 
adaptive resonance theory (ART-2) neural networks is used to cluster the history data of 
process parameters and quality criteria. Based on the results of the ART-2, the fuzzification 
procedure of fuzzy set theory is applied to define the regions of interest membership function 
of the process parameters and quality criterion. The data mining techniques, VPRS and C5.0 
algorithm, are then respectively used to extract rules. Finally, a comparison of rule 
completeness between the extracted rules of VPRS approach and C5.0 algorithm is made. The 
results show that when there are not many data records in a data base, the VPRS approach is 
more suitable to extract rules than the decision tree C5.0 algorithm. It can extract a lot of 
useful and certainly rules. 
 
Keywords: nano-particle milling process, fuzzy decision tree, fuzzy variable precision rough 
set, rule extraction, data mining 
 
the more completeness of rule-base is still unknown. Therefore, the VPRS and DT techniques 
are used to extract rules in this research. In short, the objectives of this research are to 
integrate ART-2 neural networks, fuzzy set theory, VPRS, decision tree C5.0 algorithm and 
fuzzy rule-based control to develop a fuzzy data-driven and rule-based reasoning system for 
setting a nano-particle milling process. In addition, the performances of the developed 
reasoning system will be verified by using the orthogonal array data as the test data. In the 
following sections, the methodologies are briefly described in Section 2. The results of 
applying the reasoning system in a nano-particle milling process and the verified results are 
then illustrated in Section 3. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 4. 
 
三、研究方法 
In this research, an integrated approach is proposed to develop a process parameter setting 
system for a nano-particle milling process. The detailed procedures of the proposed approach 
are stated in the following subsections. 
 
Step 1. Calculate the shift values between the current parameters and the optimal 
parameters (ΔX, ΔY)  
In this step, the shift values between the current parameters and the optimal process 
parameters (ΔX, ΔY) are calculated.  
 
Step 2. Use ART-2 networks to cluster the shift process input-output data 
In this step, the ART-2 neural network is applied to cluster the shift process input-output 
data, ΔX and ΔY. The clustering performance of ART-2 algorithm depends on the parameter 
of vigilance value ρ . In general, a smaller vigilance value setting will result in a larger 
number of clusters. When 0.2ρ = , there are 5 clusters, 0.3ρ = , there are 4 clusters, and 
0.4ρ = , there are 2 clusters. Here, the vigilance value is set at 0.3ρ =  when running the 
ART-2 algorithm to cluster the shift process input-output data. 
 
Step 3. Use data mining techniques to extract fuzzy rules 
  In this step, the data mining techniques, VPRS and DT C5.0 algorithm, are respectively 
used to extract rules from the deviation data of a nano-particle milling process. Based on the 
fuzzification procedure, the process parameters and quality criterion are transferred into 
attribute variables and are applied to extract IF-THEN rules. The extracted rules will be used 
as the fuzzy rule-base to do a fuzzy reasoning in developing process parameter setting system. 
 
Step 4. Transform the extracted rules into fuzzy reasoning rules 
In this step, the “reverse procedure” is applied to transform the extracted rules into the 
fuzzy reasoning rules. The basic idea of reversed transform is shown in Figure 1. The original 
nano-particle milling process is a conventional process model. The “reverse procedure” is 
4.2 The results of ART-2 clustering and fuzzification 
The ART-2 neural network is applied to cluster the shift input-output data and run on 
Matlab 7.0 software. In general, a smaller vigilance value setting will result in a larger 
number of clusters. Here, the vigilance value is set at 0.3ρ = . The clustering results for the 
shift quality criterion, YΔ , are shown in Table III. The center of cluster 1 is 31.18, the center 
of cluster 2 is 51.88, the center of cluster 3 is 78.96, and the center of cluster 4 is 112.63. 
Similarly, the clustering results for the shift process parameter, XΔ , are summarized in Table 
III. Based on the center of the clusters found by the ART-2 shown in Table III, the 
fuzzification procedure of fuzzy set theory is then applied to define the membership function 
for the shift process data. In this research, the trapezoid and triangle membership functions are 
used to define the shift fuzzy sets with Very High (VH), High (H), Medium (M) and Low (L) 
degrees. Therefore, the membership functions of the shift process parameters ΔX and the shift 
quality criterion ΔY are defined and shown in Figure 2. Then these membership functions are 
used in the process parameter setting system as the fuzzification procedure.

4.3The results of using VPRS & DT to extract fuzzy rules 
In this research, the VPRS and DT C5.0 algorithm are respectively used to extract fuzzy 
rules from the results of fuzzification. The results are briefly shown in Table V. When β  is 
set at 0.35 and the β-lower approximation is applied, there are 41 extracted certainly rules and 
their corresponding misclassification values found by VPRS. The DT C5.0 algorithm on SPSS 
Clementine 7.2 software is then applied to extract rules from the shift process data. It is found 
that there are 7 extracted rules. The meaning of the extracted rule can be explained in the 
following ways: 
 
Rule 1: IF parameter ΔA is “Low negative shift” and parameter ΔC is “Low positive shift” 
THEN quality criterion ΔY is “Medium positive shift”.

Abstract  
 
Nano-particles have been successfully and widely applied in many applications. The wet-type mechanical milling process is 
a popular method used to produce nano-particles. Therefore, it is very important to improve the milling process capability 
and quality by setting the optimal milling parameters. In this study, an integrated method is proposed to find the optimal 
process parameters for the nano-particle milling process. First, the orthogonal array (OA) experiment is applied to obtain the 
analytic data of the milling process. Then the response surface method (RSM) is applied to modeling the nano-particle 
milling process and calculate the objective (fitness) value, and the generalized Pareto-based scale-independent fitness 
function (GPSIFF) is used to define the non-dominated solutions. Finally, the multi-population intelligent genetic algorithm 
(MPIGA) is proposed to find the Pareto-optimal solutions. The results show that the integrated MPIGA, RSM and GPSIFF 
approach can generate the Pareto-optimal solutions for the decision maker to set the optimal parameters in the nano-particle 
milling process.

1 Introduction  
Nano-particles are new advanced materials. They refer to particles smaller than 100 nanometers (nm) which may 
be presented as individual particles or as aggregates. As comparing with traditional materials, nano-particles can 
efficiently enhance their property of high surface area in many applications such as photo-catalysis, carbon 
nanotube, nanodevice, biochip, fabric fiber, and compound material industries. The wet-type mechanical milling 
process is a popular powder technology to produce nano-particles because of the applicability to all classes of 
materials [1,5,15]. This milling process is used to powder the materials into nanometer size by stirring and 
colliding motion in a stirred ball mill. However, the nano-particle milling process is a complex process and 
hence involves a number of process parameters to simultaneously achieve the desired product qualities. To 
ensure a stable process and product qualities in the nano-particles milling process, it is necessary to optimize the 
process parameters.

The most important differences among the popular different MOEAs are the strategies which be used to generate 
the Pareto-optimal solutions. An appropriate design of the fitness evaluation method and the strategies used for 
generating the Pareto-optimal solutions will result in a good performance of MOEAs. Schaffer (1985) 
[13]developed the vector evaluated genetic algorithm (VEGA) method to find the Pareto-optimal solutions for 
multiple objective optimization problems. In his approach, a population was divided into disjoint sub-
populations, where each sub-population optimized its own objective. Each sub-population then evolves 
separately while an elitist strategy preserves the best individuals of each objective and the best individual of the 
combined objective. Ho et al. (2004)[8] used a generalized Pareto-based scale-independent fitness function 
(GPSIFF) that considered the quantitative fitness values in Pareto space for both dominated and non-dominated 
individuals to determine the Pareto-optimal solutions. The GPSIFF maintains the essence of domination 
proposed by Deb (2001)[2], and also has the characteristic of simplicity, generality and effectiveness.  
This paper integrates the concept of GPSIFF with VEGA to propose a multi-population intelligent genetic 
algorithm (MPIGA) to determine the optimal process parameters for the nano-particle milling process. In 
addition, the parameter design of Taguchi method and the response surface method (RSM) are also applied to 
economically obtain the quality criteria measurements and to modeling the nano-particle milling process, and to 
calculate the objective (fitness) value. 
2 Response surface method and Pareto-optimal solution 
2.1 Response surface method (RSM) 
The response surface method (RSM), developed by Box and Wilson in the early 1950s, is a collection of 
mathematical and statistical techniques that are used to model and analyze engineering applications. In these 
engineering applications, a response of interest is usually influenced by several variables and the objective of the 
engineering applications is to find the variables that can optimize the response. The RSM has been applied in a 
wide variety of industrial setting and parameter optimizations such as, chemical, semiconductor and electronic 
manufacturing, machining, and metal cutting processes. In general, the procedure of RSM consists of the 
following steps: [12] 
Step 1. Designing and conducting a series of experiments to get adequate and reliable measurements of the   
interesting response (e.g. orthogonal array experiment). 
Step 2. Developing mathematical models of the first and second order response surface with the best fittings. 
Step 3. Finding the optimal set of process parameters that produce a maximum or minimum value of the    
response. 
Step 4. Representing the direct and interactive effects of the process parameters through two (three)  
dimensional plots. 
If all variables are assumed to be measurable, the response surface can be expressed as follows:  
 
1 2( , ... )nY f x x x=                                                              (1) 
where n is the number of variables. 
The goal is to optimize the response variable Y. It is assumed that the independent variables are continuous and 
controllable by experiments with negligible errors. It is necessary to find a suitable approximation for the true 
functional relationship between independent variables and the response surface. 
2.2 Pareto-optimal solutions 
Many optimization problems in engineering applications inherently involve optimizing multiple non-
commensurable and competing responses. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) specially are 
appropriate to solve these multi-objective nonlinear optimization problems because they can capture a set of 
Pareto solutions in a single run of the algorithm. Most MOEAs use the concept of domination to find out the 
Pareto-optimal solutions. In these algorithms, a comparison is made to determine whether one solution 
dominates the other solution or not. Deb (2001) defined the dominate solution by the following rule[2]: 
A solution X(1) is said to dominate the other solution X (2), if both conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied: 
Condition 1: The solution X (1) is no worse than X (2) in all objectives 
Condition 2: The solution X (1) is strictly better than X (2) in all objectives.

levels, and some interactions between process parameters are investigated in this research. The five process 
parameters and their factor levels are summarized in Table 1. The interest output quality criteria of the nano-
particle milling process are the mean grain size and the variance of grain size. Both of the output quality criteria 
need to be kept to a minimum. 
 
Table 1. Factors and levels of nano-particle milling process (%: the percentage of mill volume) 
  
Factor  Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 
A Milling time 2 (H) 5 (H) 8 (H) 
B Flow velocity of circulation system 1 (L/min) 4 (L/min) 7 (L/min) 
C Rotation velocity of agitator shaft 1200 (rpm) 1800 (rpm) 2400 (rpm) 
D Solute-to-solvent weight ratio 1 wt % 4 wt % 7 wt % 
E Number of grinding balls (ZrO2) 5 % 15 % 25 % 
 
In general, the parameter design of the Taguchi method utilizes orthogonal arrays (OAs) to minimize the time 
and cost of experiments for obtaining the experimental data. In this research, the orthogonal array (OA) 
experiment instead of the full factorial experiment design is applied to obtain the response measurements of the 
milling process. The selection of an OA to be used depends on the degree of freedom of the factors and 
interactions. In this research, five process parameters, each with three levels, and the interactions between 
milling time (A) and rotation velocity of agitator (C), milling time (A) and number of grinding balls (E) are 
investigated. The calculations of the degrees of freedom are shown as follows: 
The degrees of freedom of the main factors = (3-1)*5 = 10; 
The degrees of freedom of the interactions = (3-1)*(3-1)*2 = 8; 
 
The summation of the degrees of freedom from the main factors and interactions is 18. This means we have to 
choose an L18 OA at least. Moreover, all of the parameters have three levels, the OA must be a cube of 3 (e.g. 
L9, L27, L81). Therefore an L27(313) OA is used to conduct the experiment in this research. The L27(313) OA can 
lay out 27 trials, up to 13 factors in columns, and 3 factor levels. The layout of the L27(313) OA is shown in Table 
2. It also shows the two output responses for each experimental trial. 
 
The response surface method (RSM) combined with the parameter design is a powerful optimization design 
tool in many technical fields. The RSM can be applied to obtain an approximation for a response function in 
terms of predictor variables. The linear and quadratic models are the most common response models used to 
build the relationship between the input parameters and output responses. They are generally written as follows:

Fig. 4. The flow diagram of the integrated MPIGA approach 
Step1: Encoding and generate population randomly 
This step is designed to encode the chromosome and generate population randomly. The problem variables 
are represented as a chromosome with a fixed length and the initial 3N populations are randomly generated. 
The process parameters are used to create the solution space for the MPIGA approach. The searching ranges 
for the five parameters are shown in Table 1. After normalization, each searching range is divided into 1000 
equal intervals. The binary string representation for coding space (chromosome) is adopted for this GA and 
each input parameter is encoded into 10 binary digits. For example, if  
X1=0.010, X2=0.036, X3=0.064, X4=0.256 and X5=0.065, then the chromosome will be

In this step, the initial population (3N) is randomly partitioned into three equal sub-populations (N), in 
which each sub-population optimized its own objective. For example, the sub-population 1 is used to calculate 
the objective 1, the sub-population 2 is used to calculate the objective 2 and the sub-population 3 is used to 
calculate the combined objective. 
 
Step3: Calculate the fitness values 
    In this step, we calculate the fitness function value for each single objective and combined objective. To 
calculate the combined objective, the coefficient of variance is applied to combine the multiple quality criteria 
into a combined objective in this study.

The RSM models are used to calculate the fitness (objective) values for each chromosome and the score(v) for 
each chromosome v is then calculated using equation (1). The score(v) value is generated using the

It is found that the 2nd order model gets the larger 2R value and generates the smaller mean grain size than the 1st 
order model. From these results we can infer that the relationships between the input parameters and the output 
quality criteria are nonlinear. The 2nd order models of objective1 and objective2 are then used to calculate the 
fitness in the MPIGA approach. 
4.2 Results of the integrated MPIGA approach 
The output quality criteria of the nano-particle milling process include the mean grain size and variation of 
grain size. The parameter optimization of nano-particle milling process is taken as a Min-Min optimization 
problem, i.e., minimizing the mean grain size and minimizing the variation of grain size simultaneously. In order 
to show the solution space of the multi-objective optimization problem for nano-particle milling process, 50000 
chromosomes is randomly generated and the 2nd order RSM model is applied to calculate the fitness values for 
each chromosome. Figure 5 shows the solution space and the Pareto-optimal front of the Min-Min optimization 
problem. In the Figure 5, the set of the blue (small) points is the solution space of the multi-objective nano-
particle milling process problem and the green (big circle) curve represents the possible Pareto-optimal front.  
In the integrated MPIGA approach, the population size was set at Npop=100. Two-point crossover was 
employed with the crossover probability 0.98. The one-gene mutation operation probability was specified as 
Pm=0.015, and iteration number was 2000. Under these conditions, the best 5 (candidate solutions) non-
dominated solutions are shown in Figure 6 which are the Pareto-optimal solutions. In the Figure 6, the set of the 
blue (small) points is the solution space of the multi-objective nano-particle milling problem and the 5 red (big 
circle) points represents the Pareto-optimal solutions which are obtained by the integrated MPIGA approach.
