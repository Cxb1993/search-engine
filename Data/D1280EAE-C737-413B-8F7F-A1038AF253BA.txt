and wasteful. Therefore, we propose an 
architecture to take advantage of the idea of 
spectrum sharing. In this architecture, two 
or more network operators provide a portion 
of their frequency bands as the shared band. 
The frequency blocks in the shared band are 
then dynamically allocated to the operators 
according to their demands. If the traffic 
patterns of different networks are 
complementary, it should be beneficial to 
share the spectrum. 
The concept of mobile virtual network 
operator (MVNO) arose during the planning 
and roll-out phase of 3G networks for the 
purpose of cost saving[1]. Sharing the 
wireless network has been analyzed to be a 
long-term beneficial strategy for the 
network operators[2]. There is a trend that 
network sharing will play an important role 
not only in the cellular but also in the 
broadband wireless access networks[3]. 
Therefore, we propose an architecture in 
which multiple MVNOs share the wireless 
bandwidth of a facility based operator 
called the Wireless Bandwidth Provider 
(WBP). By estimating the expected income 
from each MVNO, the WBP runs a dynamic 
programming algorithm to compute the 
optimal bandwidth allocations and achieve 
higher total revenue. 
 
三、多細胞頻譜共享系統架構與演算法 
In this section, an architecture for 
sharing spectrum between two wireless 
network operators and the algorithms for 
each component are presented. 
3.1 System Architecture 
We assume that there are two cellular 
network operators A and B located in the 
same region and the cell layouts of them are 
the same (Fig. 1). The spectrum is separated 
into three parts. Network-A band and 
Network-B band are dedicated to these two 
operators respectively, and the shared band 
can be allocated dynamically to one of them 
(Fig. 2). 
Under the assumptions, we propose an 
architecture (Fig. 3) for the two wireless 
network operators to share the spectrum 
dynamically. There are three main 
components in the system: the Base Station 
Radio Resource Manager (BS_RRM), the 
Broker, and the Arbiter. In each cell, there 
is one BS_RRM for each operator. The 
function of the BS_RRMs is to predict the 
expected traffic pattern of the next period 
using historical data and report the least 
amount of frequency blocks required for 
maintaining the call blocking probability 
under certain predefined threshold. Each

3.3 The Broker 
For a single wireless network m, at the 
beginning of each period t, the Broker of 
knows all )(tN mi , the expected spectrum 
amount in cell i, from each BS_RRM. 
Given all )(tN mi , Broker applies spectrum 
allocation algorithm to efficiently use the 
spectrum resource. At first, we assume all 
shared frequencies are available, and apply 
spectrum allocation algorithm to assign the 
frequency blocks in both F_m and F_shared, 
where F_m is the set of frequency blocks 
dedicated to network m, and F_shared is the 
set of shared frequency blocks. The 
objective of the Broker is to meet the 
demands and use as few frequencies in 
F_shared as possible. 
Broker could make plans of the 
allocation of the shared spectrum and send 
the plan to the Arbiter to request for the 
shared spectrum. If a demand element in 
cell i have been denied, Broker knows that 
there have been no available shared 
frequencies in the cell i, thus, in the next 
round, Broker will not ask for shared 
frequencies in the cell i. 
The spectrum allocation algorithm can 
be written as an integer programming 
problem. It has been shown to be an N-P 
complete problem [4]. Therefore, instead of 
finding the optimal solution, we propose a 
greedy algorithm to get an approximate 
solution which is good enough and 
time-efficient. The greedy degree of each 
cell is a function of the number of available 
frequencies and the number of unsatisfied 
demands in this cell. More precisely, the 
degree is the difference between the number 
of available frequencies and unsatisfied 
demand plus a random number.  
Assume in a cell there are p available 
frequencies and need q frequencies. The 
number of possible allocations is C(p,q), 
that is, the number of possible combination 
of n elements chosen from m elements. It is 
good to choose the cell with fewest possible 
allocations. But to calculate C(p,q) cost 
much time as m, n are big, thus, we use (p-q) 
instead because it is much more easily to 
compute (p-q) than to compute C(p,q). 
The cells are sorted according to the 
degrees of cells in a non-decreasing order. 
If the degrees of several cells are the same, 
the order of them is random. The 
randomness make the solution more 
diversified. The order is dynamically 
changed because every time a vertex is 
colored, the degree of some vertices may 
changes. 
Every time the cell has been selected, 
we choose the smallest available frequency. 
Here, we introduce the concept of compact 
allocation pattern [5]. A compact pattern is 
the set of cells which can use the same 
frequency. Here, the cluster size is three, 
thus, we have three different compact 
patterns. Every time a cell is assigned a 
frequency, for each cell belongs to the same 
compact pattern, if the cell has unsatisfied 
demand, we will assign the color to it, too. 
In other words, instead of assigning a 
frequency to a cell at one time, we assign a 
frequency to a set of cells. 
Additionally, while a cell has no 
available frequency to use, we perform the 
return a list of granted frequencies Gm(t,,r) 
to the Brokers respectively. 
 
四、頻寬共享系統之架構與分析 
In this section, we propose a generic 
model for multiple MVNOs to share the 
bandwidth of a single provider. In addition, 
we also derive the formulas of the dynamic 
programming algorithm for the bandwidth 
provider to maximize its total revenue. 
 
4.1 System Model 
In our model (Fig. 5), there are N 
MVNOs and one wireless bandwidth 
provider (WBP). The WBP owns the core 
network and wireless access facilities such 
as 3G/3.5G base stations, WiMAX base 
stations, or Wi-Fi access points. It acts as a 
bridge between the customers and the 
MVNOs. The N MVNOs provide different 
sorts of services to the customers via the 
connection service of the WBP. The 
MVNOs are in charge of the service 
provisioning and customer management 
without operating a physical network. 
The WBP charges for the connection 
service in a usage-based fashion. In order to 
maximize its total revenue, the WBP can 
adjust the bandwidth allocations to each 
MVNO every interval T. Changes of the 
allocations can only happen on time epochs 
jT, j = 1, 2,…, and the setting should keep 
unchanged in the following interval, which 
is denoted by Ij (see Fig. 6). The allocation 
decisions are based on the traffic patterns 
and the service contracts of the MVNOs. 
The traffic patterns of the customers can be 
supplied by the MVNOs or estimated by 
WBP according to previous measurements. 
We assume that the customer arrival 
processes of the MVNOs are all Poisson but 
the arrival rates could change across 
different intervals. The arrival rates during 
Ij are denoted by λj = [λj1, λj2,…, λjN]. The 
service time distributions are assumed 
general but do not change with time. Bi(t) 
denotes the CDF of the service time of 
MVNO-i and 1/μi is its average service time. 
sj = [sj1, sj2,…, sjN] denotes the system state 
at the beginning of interval Ij and sji is the 
number of customers in MVNO-i at jT. The 
cost vector which WBP charges the 
MVNOs per customer per second can also 
vary across time intervals and is denoted by 
cj = [cj1, cj1,…, cjN]. 
The bandwidth allocation during Ij is bj 
= [bj1, bj1,…, bjN] and the total bandwidth W 
of the WBP should not be exceeded, i.e. 
1
,N jii b W j= ≤ ∀∑ . Once the WBP determines

value of τ affects both the estimation 
accuracy and the amount of computation 
required. There is a trade-off in choosing 
the value. If τ is too small, it will lead to 
higher computation complexity. On the 
opposite, if τ is too large, there will be 
accuracy issues. 
 
4.3 The Optimality Equation 
Maximizing the total returns in the 
previously described model is a positive 
dynamic programming problem[8]. 
According to the derivation in the previous 
subsection, the expected total return from 
all MVNOs during interval Ij given the state 
sj, the arrival rate λj, and the bandwidth 
allocation bj (i.e. the action taken) can be 
expressed as

and the optimal policy bj* is the bandwidth 
allocation which makes Vj(sj, λj) maximal. 
Let Mi denote the maximum number of 
customers of MVNO-i when the highest 
level of bandwidth is allocated to it. The 
size of the state space is approximately 
1
( )N iiO M=∏ . If the number of MVNOs (N) 
is small, the computational complexity of 
the optimality equation will be mainly on 
computing the expected revenue Rj. 
Therefore, the overall complexity is 
( )311( )( )N Nb i iiiO C K M M== ∑∏  where Cb is 
the number of possible bandwidth 
allocations. 
Note that one can incorporate as many 
stages of recursion as possible when 
computing the optimal allocation. However, 
the solution would converge after extending 
to certain number of stages. Since the 
computing process of the DPA is actually 
backward, it is important to decide the 
computation of the DPA for each possible 
system state should be completed before the 
start of each interval. Then the WBP 
decides which bandwidth allocation (action) 
to take according to the actual system state 
at the start of the interval and the computed 
results. 
Based on these parameter settings, 
maximum number of customers of the two 
MVNOs are 75 and 10 respectively, and the 
size of the state space is 508. The number of 
possible bandwidth allocations (Cb) is 6. 
During simulation, the length of each 
interval T is set to be 30 minutes, i.e. the 
WBP runs DPA and decides the optimal 
action every 30 minutes. The value of τ is 
set to be 10 seconds, i.e. K = 180. The 
number of dynamic programming stages 
affects both the effectiveness and the 
amount of computations of the proposed 
algorithm. We ran simulations for 1 to 5 
stages and compare the results with the 
fixed bandwidth allocation scenario (in 
which 4.5Mbps allocated for both MVNO-1 
and MVNO-2). 
We ran 20 repetitions of the 
simulations, each lasting for a 24-hour 
period, and took the average of the results. 
 
4.4.2 Simulation Results 
Fig. 8 compares the total revenues 
achieved by adopting the fixed allocation 
scheme or DPA with different number of 
stages. The improvements of the DPA are 
around 14.5% to 20.5%. As the number of 
stages increases, the gain of the total 
revenue gradually saturates just as expected. 
Fig. 9 gives an example of the 
resulting bandwidth allocations via 
computing different number of stages in 
DPA. We find that the results of 4 and 
5-stage DPA are very close to the 3-stage 
DPA in most simulation repetitions under 
the default parameter settings. Hence, only 
the plots of 1 to 3-stage DPA bandwidth 
allocations are shown in Fig. 9. This 
example shows that one can get “smoother'” 
bandwidth allocations, i.e. there are less 
bandwidth fluctuations, if more stages are 
incorporated in the DPA. In addition, since 
the average service time of IPTV customers 
is longer than the length of a single stage, 
DPA with 3 or more stages can predict the

programming, using default parameters.
