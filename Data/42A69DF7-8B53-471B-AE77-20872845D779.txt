一、前言 
1991 年日本 NEC 研究員 Iijima[1]首度發
現奈米碳管(CNT)，奈米碳管主要是碳原子
以 sp2 鍵結成六圓環排列形成石墨結構
(graphene sheet)且其六圓環中心軸有不同
夾角，使得碳管整體會有不同程度的螺旋
性，而 CNT 兩端是以五圓環或七圓環形成
封閉的管狀物。若只有單層石墨結構形成
的同心圓柱的 CNT 稱為 single-walled 
carbon nanotubes (SWNT)，而由 2~50 層石
墨 結 構 形 成 同 心 圓 柱 的 CNT 稱 為
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT)。奈
米碳球(carbon nanocapsules, CNC) [1]是在
1991 年和 CNT 一起被發現的。CNC 是一
種多面體的碳簇材料，每一個碳原子皆為
sp2 的石墨結構，大部分為六圓環，邊角和
轉折部份為五圓環或七圓環所構成，其直
徑範圍約在 1~100nm，依內部結構不同可
分為中空奈米碳球(hollow CNC)與填充金
屬奈米碳球(metal filled CNC)。工研院研發
以 pulse plasma arc-discharge 方式[2]，可以
穩定且大量製造出純度較高的奈米碳球。 
    由於 CNT 與 CNC 在機械、導電與導
熱上皆有優異的性質，將其加入高分子內
形成複材，可增強高分子材料物性，如機
械強度、導電性、導熱性等。尤其將高長
徑比的 CNT 加入絕緣性良好的高分子內，
使 CNT 在高分子內形成導電的網路結構，
可進一步應用在靜電消散、靜電塗布與電
磁波遮蔽等方面[3]。 
 
二、研究目的 
對排聚苯乙烯(sPS)因其結晶速率快、熔
點高、電絕緣性良好、耐化學腐蝕性、耐
水及耐光性優良，以及擁有足夠的力學強
度，在工業應用上有相當的潛力。將相同
結構但不同長徑比的CNT與CNC加入 sPS
工程塑膠內，可製備功能性高分子複材，
提升 sPS 的強度、導電、與導熱特性。本
研究探討不同長徑比的奈米碳材對於 sPS
複材在流變與導電 percolation threshold 和 
scaling law 影 響 ， 並 進 一 步 探 討 其
percolation 網路結構對 sPS 結晶行為的影
響，此研究結果在學術上與工業上均甚具
價值。 
 
三、文獻探討 
有許多研究探討CNT加入不同高分子基
材內對複材導電性的影響，例如 atactic 
polystyrene (aPS)[4-14] 、 sPS [15] 、
polycarbonate (PC) [16] 、 poly(methyl 
methacrylate) (PMMA) [17]、polyethylene 
(PE)[18,19]與 polypropylene (PP) [20,21]，
然而如何在複材內分散良好，且形成 CNT
導電網路結構為研究的重點。percolation 
scaling law 提供了一個良好的理論基礎，其
定義為 P ~ (φ-φc)β ，其中 P 為材料特性，φ
為 filler 體積分率，φc為材料特性突然改變
的體積分率(percolation threshold)， β為指
數參數，藉此研究 filler 含量與分散性對導
電度的影響。Pöstchke 等人[16]與 Du 等人
[17]指出，CNT 分散均勻時，因 CNT 與高
分子分子鏈交互作用，會形成CNT-polymer
的網路結構，可以量測複材流變特性來研
究 CNT-polymer 網路結構。由以上可知，
在複材內除了高分子本身 entanglement 的
網路結構外，尚有 CNT-CNT 網路結構與
CNT-polymer 網路結構。 
  有許多研究指出將CNT添加入結晶性高
分子會使得結晶速率變快，如 PE [22-26]、
PP [27-33]、sPS[15,34]、 poly(vinyl alcohol) 
[35] 與  poly(ethylene oxide) [36]等高分
子。Lu 等人[33]以 TEM 和 DSC 研究發現
 4
頻時斜率趨近於 1.60。而隨著 CNC 含量增
加，複材熔體在低頻區斜率會小於 1.6。在
CNC 含量 5wt%的複材中，可發現 G’在低
頻區會形成一 plateau，隨著 CNC 含量越
多，此 plateau 區域會越明顯，且 G’數值越
大。更高 CNC 含量複材熔體之 G’會大於
G”，代表著彈性效應越大，而黏性效應越
小，即複材熔體由 liquid-like 轉變成
solid-like 行為。高含量 CNC (32 wt%以上)
的複材，熔體的 G’值與 ω無關，此時 log G’ 
vs. log ω之斜率趨近於 0。 
  Figure 3(b)與(c)不同成分 sPS/CNT 與
aPS/CNT 複材之 G’對 ω全對數圖形，可發
現純 aPS 在低頻時斜率為 1.61 與純 sPS 相
似。可發現隨著 CNT 含量增加，複材熔體
在低頻區斜率會小於 1.60。而在 CNT 含量
0.1wt%的複材中，發現 G’在低頻區會形成
一 plateau，隨著 CNT 含量越多，此 plateau
區域會越明顯，且G’數值越大。高含量CNT 
(2 wt%以上)的複材，熔體的 G’值與 ω 無
關，此時 log G’ vs. log ω之斜率趨近於 0。 
  Figure 4(a)不同成分 sPS/CNC 複材之 G”
對 ω全對數圖形，可觀察到：純 sPS 在低
頻區之斜率為 0.97，而隨著 CNC 含量增
加，複材熔體在低頻區斜率會小於 0.97，
且 G”值會變得較大。當 CNC 含量到達 25 
wt%時，低頻區斜率會明顯下降，此時在
低頻區亦會有一明顯 plateau 形成。若 CNC
含量大於 32 wt%時，G”值與 ω 無關，亦
即 log G” vs. log ω之斜率趨近於 0。 
   Figure 4(b) 與 (c) 分 別 為 不 同 成 分
sPS/CNT 與 aPS/CNT 複材之 G”對 ω全對
數圖形，可發現純 aPS在低頻時斜率為 0.95
與純 sPS 相似。隨著 CNT 含量增加，複材
熔體在低頻區斜率會小於 0.97，且 G”值會
變得較大。且低頻區亦會有一明顯 plateau
形成，若 CNT 含量大於 2 wt%時，G”值與
ω無關，亦即 log G” vs. log ω之斜率趨近
於 0。 
  不同成分 sPS/CNC 複材熔體動態頻率掃
描所得相位角(δ)對 log G*做圖，可得Figure 
5(a)。一般而言對 homogeneous 線性高分
子熔體，在低頻區其δ為 90o，可發現純 sPS
符合此一特徵。當 CNC 含量為 5 wt%時，
δ開始偏離 90o。隨著 CNC 含量增加，複材
熔體之δ在低 G*區域並不再是 90o，且其曲
線有一最大值。 
  Figure 5(b) 與 5(c) 分別為不同成分
sPS/CNT 與 aPS/CNT 複材熔體動態頻率掃
描所得相位角(δ)對 log G*圖形。可發現純
aPS 在低 G*區δ接近 90o 與純 sPS 相似。當
CNT 含量為 0.1 wt%時，δ開始偏離 90o。
隨著 CNT 含量增加，複材熔體之δ在低 G*
區域並不再是 90o，且其曲線有一最大值。 
    Pöstchke 等人[16]更進一步的指出，聚
碳酸酯(PC)在加入奈米碳管後，如果分散
均勻時，因 CNT 與 PC 分子鏈交互作用，
會形成 CNT-polymer 的網路結構，因此在
低頻區可觀察到 G’的 plateau。以此類推，
Figure 3 所觀察到的現象分別為 CNC-sPS
高分子鏈與 CNT-sPS 高分子鏈在複材熔體
中形成相互糾纏網路結構。Du 等人[17]曾
探討 PMMA/CNT 複材熔體的流變行為，
其作法是以 rheological percolation 理論來
研究 CNT 在 PMMA 熔體內的微結構，即
探討不同含量的CNT在高分子內的行為表
現，而複材的 rheological percolation 可用下
式表示: 
           ')(' ', GGcG
βφφ −∝         (1) 
其中 G’為 storage modulus、φ為 filler 的體
積分率、φc,G’為流變 percolation threshold 體
積分率，βG’為指數參數。因此將複材在頻
率為 0.53 rad/s 之 log G’對φ做圖，可得
Figure 6，發現相同 filler 含量下，sPS/CNT
之 G’上升較 sPS/CNC 大。而 aPS/CNT 與
sPS/CNT 之 G’對φ有相同的趨勢。由 Figure 
6 插圖所示，符合式(1)的關係式，其結果
如Table 1所示。可發現複材的βG’在 2.5~3.0
之間，而 sPS/CNC 複材之φc,G'為 0.0134，
較 sPS/CNT 複材 φc,G'(0.001) 大。然而
aPS/CNT 複材φc,G'為 0.0007 與 aPS/CNT 差
異不大。因此在 sPS/CNC複材中，形成CNC
聚集體與 sPS 分子鏈相互糾纏形成網路結
構的最低體積分率為 0.0134 (2 wt%)。相較
之下在 sPS/CNT 複材中，形成 CNT 與 sPS
分子鏈相互糾纏形成網路結構的最低濃度
為 0.001 (0.15 wt%)。  
  進一步將固定頻率下(0.53 rad/s)所得複
材之 G’除上該頻率下 matrix 之 G’(G’m)使
之無因次化，而φ-φc,G’除上φc,G’使之無因次
 6
因次關係式。 
 
5.3高分子 tacticity對複材導電性質之影響 
  另外值得注意的課題為：高分子 tacticity
的不同對 CNT-CNT 網路形成的影響。
aPS/CNT 複材φc,σ為 0.0012 比 sPS/CNT 複
材φc,σ小四倍，然而此兩複材之φc,G'差異不
大。意味著 aPS 與 sPS 在熔體時 CNT 於其
中有相同的分散性，但在固體時有很大的
不同。此乃因 aPS 與 sPS 結晶性的不同，
Figure 10 為不同組成 sPS/CNT 粉末經 290 
oC 熱壓 3 分鐘後於室溫下冷卻所得薄膜之
WAXD 曲線。 可發現純 sPS 具α型晶體。
添加少量 CNT 後(0.5 wt%)，在 2θ= 6.10o
與 12.27o 處有明顯β型晶體繞射峰存在，且
α型晶體也隨之消失，由 DSC 熔融結晶的
結果可發現ΔH 會隨著增加(稍後討論)，代
表著 CNT 摻入 sPS 內幫助成核，與 Lu 等
人[33]研究 iPP/CNT 複材之結果類似，即
熔融結晶時 sPS 會在 CNT 表面形成穿晶
層。當 sPS 在 CNT 表面成核長成 lamella，
當不同 CNT 表面成長的 lamella 碰撞時，
會在晶體前緣有不平衡的應力，為了釋放
此一應力，使得 CNT 在複材內的位子重新
排列，因此造成 aPS/CNT 複材φc,σ與比
sPS/CNT 複材φc,σ小四倍。 
 
5.4 filler 對複材 sPS 晶型影響 
   sPS 熔融結晶時會有α與β兩種晶型，影
響此兩晶型含量的主因為:熔融處理溫度
(Tmax)與處理時間(tmax)，為暸解加入 filler
對 sPS 晶型的影響，將 sPS/CNC 升到 Tmax
等溫 10 分鐘後以 10 oC/min 降至室溫，再
以 FTIR 觀察複材內 sPS 晶型。α晶型的特
徵吸收峰為 852與 902 cm-1，而β晶型為 858
與 911 cm-1，amorphous phase 為 841 與 906 
cm-1，由 Figure 11，可知不同 filler 與其添
加量對 sPS 晶型的形成有影響。藉由 Wu
等人[42]的經驗方程式。 
 
   852
852 858
A aP
A a A a

α β
= +            (7) 
其中 A841、A852、A858，分別為 amorphous、
α與β晶型的吸收峰，aα與 aβ為轉換因子，
其值為 aα= 0.178、aβ= 0.272。經式(7)計算
可得到α晶型的含量，如 Figure 11 插圖，
可知純 sPS 在 Tmax =300oC 等溫 10 min 後，
sPS 結晶為 100%的β晶型，若經 Tmax 
=275oC 熱處理後 sPS 結晶所得為 100%的α
晶型。但當加入 1 wt% CNT(或 CNC)時，
經 275oC 熱處理後，可誘導 sPS 結晶產生β
晶型，filler 含量為 1wt%經 Tmax =280 oC 熱
處理後，sPS 熔融結晶後已完全為β晶型，
由此可知CNT與CNC的存在有助於β晶型
產生，且在相同 filler 含量下，CNC 較 CNT
容易誘導 sPS 產生β晶型。 
  將 sPS 複材以 hot stage 熱處理，升到
300oC 等溫 10 分鐘將 sPS 晶核完全消除，
迅 速 丟 入 液 態 氮 quench ， 可 得
melt-quenched sample，此時降溫速率相當
大。Figure 12 為不同成分 sPS/CNT 複材
melt-quenched 之 WAXD 曲線。可發現在此
降溫條件下，純 sPS 與加入 0.05wt% CNT
之複材為 amorphous 的 sample。隨著 CNT
含量增至 0.1 wt%，可發現在 2θ= 6.10o 與
12.27o 處有明顯β晶體相關的繞射峰存在，
但在 2θ= 6.72o 處亦有一個與α晶體相關之
小繞射峰，當 CNT 含量增加至 5 wt%，此
一小繞射峰便隨之消失。因此在降溫速率
大的情形下，CNT 含量大於 0.05wt%容易
誘使 sPS 結晶產生β晶體，但仍有少許α晶
體。隨著 CNT 添加量增加至 5 wt%時，sPS
結晶全生成β晶體。藉 WAXD 繞射曲線下
面積分析可計算複材中 sPS 之結晶度
(ϕWAXD /(1-φCNT))，發現隨著 CNT 含量增
加，ϕWAXD /(1-φCNT)會明顯上升(Table 2)。 
 
5.5 sPS 複材動態結晶 
  將 sPS/CNT melt-quenched sample，進行
DSC 升溫實驗可量得明顯的玻璃轉移溫
度。實驗流程如下： 
o o o oo o o10 C/min 10 C/min 10 C/min25 C 300 C,10min 25 C 300 C⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯→ ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯→ ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯→
 
Figure 13(a)~(c)為不同重量比例複材 DSC
第一次升溫、第一次降溫、第二次升溫之
曲線圖，其中冷結晶峰溫度為 Tp,cc，熔融
結晶峰溫度為 Tp, mc。經 quench 處理的
sample 因為急速降溫 sPS 分子鏈瞬間被凍
住，分子鏈自由體積較大，故第一次升溫
過程中分子鏈需吸收較大能量， heat 
capacity (ΔCp)會增加，產生明顯的 Tg 轉
 8
表示加入CNC 不會改變 sPS 分子鏈的運動
程度。 
由 Table 3 可知，neat sPS 之 Tp,cc 為
148.2oC，當 CNC 含量為 0.1、0.5wt%時，
Tp,cc會下降 3~4oC。CNC 含量增加到 1wt%
時，Tp,cc 會大幅下降 10oC 以上。當 CNC
含量增加到 2、5wt%時，Tp,cc 下降幅度會
趨緩，含量為 5wt% CNC 的複材 Tp,cc 為
132.3oC，與 neat sPS 相差了 16oC。因此判
斷複材在第一次升溫時，Tp,cc 會隨著 CNC
含量增加而往低溫移動，顯示添加 CNC 會
使 sPS 冷結晶變快。 
sPS/CNC 複 材 之 冷 結 晶 熱 放 量
[ΔHc,c/(1-φCNC)] 在添加少量 CNC(0.1、
0.5wt%)時，沒有明顯變化，但加入 1、2、
5wt%含量後其值明顯變小，顯示 CNC 大
量摻入會使 sample 結晶，且結晶度會隨
CNC 含量增加而增大，因此升溫冷結晶時
crystallizability 變小。 
Figure 16(a)顯示熔融溫度(Tm,f)不隨
CNC 含量而變，約略在 270oC 左右。熔融
峰的形狀會隨著 CNC 增多而變得更陡峭、
尖銳。 
Figure 16(b)為不同重量比例 sPS/CNC
複材之 DSC 第一次降溫曲線圖，如同
sPS/CNT 複材所得結果，在 sPS 添加入
CNC 後，其動態熔融結晶的晶型皆為β型。
Table 3 可知，當複材加入 0.1wt%含量的
CNC，Tp,cm 相對於純 sPS 增加 3oC。加入
1wt%含量後，Tp,cm 上升到 247oC，增加
10oC，CNC 增加至 2、5wt%時，Tp,cm上升
幅度趨緩，Tp,cm 約為 250oC。整體而言，
CNC 會使 sPS 的 Tp,cm升高，亦即 CNC 會
讓 sPS 融熔結晶速率變快。 
sPS/CNC 複 材 熔 融 結 晶 放 熱 量
[ΔHc,m/(1-φCNC)] (Table 3) 在 添 加 少 量
CNC(0.1、0.5wt%)時，沒有明顯的變化，
但加入 1、2、5wt%含量後，其值明顯下降，
顯示CNC 大量摻入會使得 sPS 融熔結晶時
的 crystallizability 變小。 
    Figure 16(c)為不同重量比例 sPS/CNC
複材之 DSC 第二次升溫曲線圖。可明顯觀
察到，若 CNC 含量增加，Tml 會往高溫移
動，上升約 5~6oC；Tmh則是往低溫緩慢移
動，下降約 1~2oC，使得 Tml峰與 Tmh峰愈
靠近。CNC 含量增加至 2wt%，Tml峰會變
成一個 shoulder 而與 Tmh峰相鄰，當 CNC
含量達 5wt%時，Tml 峰與 Tmh 峰合併形成
單一熔融峰。 
  Figure 17 為 sPS 複材融熔結晶之 Tp,mc 隨
filler 含量改變之曲線圖。可發現含 CNT 之
複材其Tp,mc值較含CNC者高，意謂著CNT
比 CNC 更容易使 sPS 整體結晶速率變快。 
 
5.6 sPS 複材等溫結晶 
    將不同比例之 sPS/CNT 與 sPS/CNC
複材依下列流程進行等溫結晶實驗：

    複材等溫結晶過程之DSC放熱曲線可
分幾個區段來分析，首先放熱曲線會下降
到最低點(此時間定義為 tpeak)，再慢慢上
升，當晶體完全結晶時，放熱曲線會趨於
平坦，定義結晶完全時間為 tf，由該點取水
平 baseline 向前延伸與放熱曲線之交點求
取開始結晶時間 ti。放熱曲線與水平線間的
面積為結晶總放熱量ΔH(t=∞)，於 ti~tf 間取
任一時間 t，求得 ti 至 t 時之結晶放熱量
ΔH(t)，定義ΔH(t)/ΔH(t=∞)為相對結晶度
X，由於 sPS 結晶區與非結晶區密度相近，
故可將 Xc視為體積分率結晶度，由 Avrami 
方程式: 
    
n
i1 X(t) exp[ k(t t ) ]− = − −          (8) 
t 為結晶時間、k 為整體結晶速率、n 為
Avrami 指數將 ln[-ln(1-X)]對 ln t 作圖，取
X=0.01~0.13 之區間作線性迴歸，從斜率與
截距可得到 n 與 k 值。 
首先討論整體結晶速率 k 值。Figure 
18(a) 為 ln k 對 Tc做圖，可知相同組成下，
Tc越高，k 值愈小，越不易結晶。相同 Tc (如
Tc=256oC)，CNT 與 CNC 含量越多，k 值
越大，代表 sPS 整體結晶速率變快。且在
CNT 與 CNC 相同含量下但添加量小於 1 
wt%時，可發現 sPS/CNT 複材的 k 值大於
sPS/CNC。 然而當 CNT 與 CNC 的添加量
大於 2 wt%時，sPS/CNT 與 sPS/CNC 複材
有相似的整體結晶速率。Figure 18(b)為 n
對 Tc 做圖，從圖中可將 sPS/CNT 與
sPS/CNC複材分為兩類:一類是純 sPS與低
filler含量(sPS/CNT: 99.95/0.05與 sPS/CNC: 
99.9/0.1、99.5/0.5)，n 值範圍約略在 2.5~3
左右；一類是高 filler 含量 (sPS/CNT:

六、結論 
    本研究添加不同長徑比的 CNC 與
CNT 奈米碳材至 sPS 中，將流變和導電實
驗所得數據以 percolation 方法分析，探討
複材內 CNC 與 CNT 在 sPS 複材內的立體
排列結構，結果列於 Table 1。由表可知，
長徑比較大的奈米碳材對於 sPS 複材不論

網狀微結構。且流變 threshold 遠小於導電
threshold。由於 tacticity 不同使得 aPS/CNT
複材φc,σ與 sPS/CNT 複材φc,σ有四倍的差
異。將 CNT 與 CNC 分別摻入 sPS 高分子
內，有助於β晶型的產生，然而在動態冷結
晶時複材仍是以形成α型晶體為主。且不論
是動態結晶或等溫結晶，添加 CNT 與 CNC
均會使得 sPS 高分子整體結晶變快，主因
為添加 filler 後使得結晶成核變得容易。另
外可發現複材φc,G’與 n 值改變的濃度有很
大關連性，意謂著當複材內 filler 濃度達到
形成 filler-sPS 網路結構，會使得 sPS 高分
子結晶成長由三維成長(球晶)變成二維成
長(盤狀)。故 filler-polymer 網路結構會影響
半結晶性高分子的結晶成長行為。

preparation [6–16]. Mechanical strength and chemical resistance of
sPS samples are associated with crystalline structure as well as
crystallinity and their well-developed morphology. When induced
from the melt state, either a- or b-form crystals with TTTT chain
conformation can be obtained. In contrast, d- and g-form crystals
with TTGG chain conformation are favored by solution crystalliza-
tion when solvent is involved. Currently, there are many articles
that have studied the characteristics of crystalline structure using
wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) [14–16].
Effects of CNTs on the crystallization and morphologies of
polymers have been investigated in many polymers such as poly-
ethylene [17–19], polypropylene [20–25], poly(vinyl alcohol) [26]
and poly(ethylene oxide) [27]. However, to the best of our knowl-
edge, there are no reports of sPS crystallization induced by CNCs (or
CNTs) to date. Two important issues should be addressed to prepare
polymer composites with CNT nano-particles. The ﬁrst is the
requirement of uniform distribution of CNTs throughout the poly-
mer matrix to provide effective reinforcement for either mechan-
ical, heat or electric properties. The second is the presence of good
interfacial strength between CNTs and polymers for transferring
the applied load from the matrix to the CNTs. A modiﬁcation of the
CNT surface is generally required to achieve these two goals.
In this paper, we described the effects of CNC addition on the
crystallization, crystalline modiﬁcation, crystal growth rate,
thermal stability and lamellar morphologies developed in the sPS/
CNC composites using several analytical techniques. In contrast
with sPS/CNC composites, CNTs are also employed as the counter-
part ﬁller to reveal the aspect ratio of carbon tubes on the crys-
tallization kinetics of sPS. Our results show that both CNCs and
CNTs are excellent nucleating agents to enhance the crystallization
rate of sPS matrix.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and composite preparation
sPS pellets with a weight average molecular weight of 200 kg/
mol were obtained from Dow Chemical Co. CNCs and CNTs were
kindly provided by ITRI. The densities of sPS and CNC are 1.06 and
1.60 g/cm3, respectively. According to ITRI, CNCs were produced by
a pulse plasma arc-discharge method [3]. The as-received CNCs
were dispersed in the H2SO4/HNO3 solution with a weight ratio of
3/1 in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 1 h so as to
modify the CNC surface and then were reﬂuxed at 80 C for 6 h to
induce –COOH group upon the CNC particles. After ﬁltration, the
CNC particles were collected and rinsed with deionized water until
the PH of mixture reached 7. Later, they were dried at 75 C prior to
the composite preparation. Similar surface treatments were per-
formed for the as-received CNT particles.
sPS/CNC composites with various compositions were prepared
by dissolving the weighted sPS pellets in ortho-dichlorobenzene
(o-DCB) solvent at 140 C, and the surface-treated CNCs were then
added to the homogeneous solution. This was followed by ultra-
sonic treatment for 3 h. The uniform solution suspension with 1%
(w/v) was then precipitated drop-by-drop into a 20-fold excess
volume of methanol. The precipitated composite powders were
continuously dried in a vacuum oven until the residual solvent was
removed. This was subsequently judged from the FTIR spectra in
the absence of any o-DCB absorbance peaks at 1130, 1170 and
1249 cm1. The as-prepared composites exhibited a small IR
absorbance peak at 572 cm1, and WAXD results showed the
diffraction angles at 9.2, 15.9 and 17(Cu target), indicating the
presence of small amount of g-form crystallites [28]. Composites
with CNC weight fractions ranging from 0.001 to 0.05 were
prepared in this manner. In this work, the code of 99/1 represents
the weight ratio of sPS to CNC, and the corresponding volume
fraction (fCNC) is obtained using the respective densities of sPS and
CNC.
2.2. DSC measurements for crystallization kinetics
The crystallization and melting behavior of the sPS/CNC
composites were investigated using a Perkin–Elmer DSC7 under N2
atmosphere. Prior to measurements, indium and zinc standards
were used to calibrate the enthalpies of fusion and melting
temperatures. By holding the as-prepared samples at 300 C for
10 min and then quenching in the liquid nitrogen, amorphous
composites veriﬁed by FTIR and WAXD were obtained for the
dynamic crystallization studies.
To perform the dynamic crystallization, the melt-quenched
amorphous composites were heated at a rate of 10 C/min to 300 C
for the cold-crystallization study (1st heating scan). After holding at
300 C for 10 min, they were then cooled at a rate of 10 C/min to
room temperature for the melt-crystallization study (1st cooling
scan). Afterwards, a subsequent heating at 10 C/min was carried
out to reveal the melting of sPS crystals developed during melt
crystallization (2nd heating scan). To reveal the crystal modiﬁcation
developed in cold crystallization, in situ FTIR measurements were
performed during 1st heating scan until melting. In addition, the
crystal modiﬁcation developed after melt crystallization was also
studied by FTIR prior to the 2nd heating scan.
For isothermal crystallization, as-prepared samples were ﬁrst
held at 300 C for 10 min to remove the thermal history. By this
thermal treatment, our FTIR results showed that the memory effect
of a-form crystallites was completely erased [8]. Samples were then
rapidly cooled to the desired crystallization temperature (Tc) to
complete the phase transformation, and a subsequent heating trace
was performed at a heating rate of 10 C/min. The crystallized
samples were frequently checked by FTIR and WAXD and only
b-form sPS crystallites were obtained for samples crystallized in
this manner.
2.3. FTIR measurements for crystal modiﬁcation
In situ FTIR measurements were performed using a Perkin–
Elmer FTIR spectrometer (Spectrum 100) equipped with a Mettler
heating stage (FP900) for temperature control. In order to measure
the instantaneous spectral changes during cold crystallization (1st
heating scan), a resolution of 2 cm1 with three scans were taken
during heating at a rate of 10 C/min. Consecutive spectral
recording was performed at an interval of w20 s until sample
melting. On the other hand, a total of 32 scans with a resolution of
2 cm1 were taken at room temperature for the melt-crystallized
samples.
2.4. PLM measurements for crystal growth rate
A polarized light microscope (PLM, Leica DMLP) equipped with
a hot stage (THMS600, Linkam) was used to monitor the dimension
variation of spherulites (or axilites). The samples were ﬁrst main-
tained at 300 C for 10 min and then quickly cooled to Tc for crys-
tallization. Crystal growth rate (G) of sPS was determined from the
slope of spherulitic radius (or axilitic half-axis) versus elapsed time.
2.5. WAXD measurements for crystal modiﬁcation
To characterize the crystal form of the sPS/CNC composites,
WAXD intensity proﬁles of the crystallized samples were obtained
using a DMAX2000 goniometer (Rigaku, Cu target). Data were
collected from 5 to 30 in 2q in steps of 0.02 at a scanning rate of
1/min.

the a-crystalline form. In the respective wavenumber region, the
absorbance band contributed from the amorphous phase is located
at 841 and 906 cm1, respectively. It is apparent that only a-crys-
talline form is observed for the neat sPS sample; however, a small
amount of CNC addition leads to the favorite formation of the
b-crystalline form. Wu et al. [16] have derived an empirical equa-
tion to estimate the percentage of a-form (Pa) developed in the
crystallites, as follows,
Pa ¼ A852=aaA852=aa þ A858=ab
(1)
where A841, A852, and A858 are the integrated area of amorphous,
a- and b-forms, respectively, after de-convolution of the spectra
ranging from 865 to 820 cm1. The conversion coefﬁcient aa and ab
are found to be 0.178 and 0.272, respectively. Based on Eq. (1), the
Tmax dependence of Pa is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. It should be
noted that the as-prepared composites, mainly in the amorphous
state, will preferentially crystallize in the a-form and are subse-
quently melted away during heating to Tmax (Fig. 3a, discussed
later). For the neat sPS sample, Tmax of 300 C is sufﬁciently high to
erase all the a-form memory, producing crystallites with b form
only. For Tmax lower than 300 C, on the other hand, mixed
a/b-crystalline form is found and the a-form content is gradually
increased with decreasing Tmax. At Tmax¼ 275 C, only a-form
crystallites are obtained in the absence of b form. With respect to
the Tmax dependence of Pa, our FTIR results are consistent with
those based mainly on the WAXD results [8,29]. Addition of CNC
leads to the reduction of Pa at a given Tmax, and the transition for the
full b-form formation is signiﬁcantly decreased to 277 C for the
sPS/CNC¼ 99/1 composites. Our FTIR results indicate that forma-
tion of b-form sPS is favored after the adding CNC particles.
Previous ﬁndings on the polymorphism issue demonstrated that
addition of foreign particles (clays [30,31] and nano-CaCO3 [29]) or
miscible polymers (aPS [32], poly(styrene-co-a-methyl styrene
[33], and poly(2,6-dimethylphenylene) [32,34]) seem to favor the
b-form and depress the a-form formation.
3.2. Dynamic crystallization
For the melt-quenched amorphous composites, the heating
traces are shown in Fig. 3a. Tg is measured from the mid-point of
the heat capacity jump; the peak temperature of the cold crystal-
lization is referred to as Tp,cc, and the crystallization enthalpy
determined from the integral area of the exotherm is denoted DHcc.
Based on the in situ FTIR measurements, the crystallites developed
are in the a-form regardless of the CNC content (Fig. 4). Therefore,
the melting temperature is referred to as Tm,a. For the melt crys-
tallization studies, the samples were held at 300 C for 10 min and
were then cooled down at a rate of 10 C/min. Fig. 3b shows the
cooling curves with the crystallization peak temperature and
exothermic enthalpy denoting Tp,mc and DHmc, respectively.
Moreover, the FTIR spectra of the melt-crystallized samples show
the exclusive presence of b-form sPS (Fig. 5). Thus, the subsequent
heating scan (Fig. 3c) displays the melting of b-form sPS, and the
corresponding melting temperature is denoted to Tm,b. The
measured thermal properties are tabulated in Table 1, inwhichDHcc
and DHmc are normalized with fCNC to represent its crystallizability
owing to the presence of CNCs.
Fig. 4 shows the FTIR spectral changes of neat sPS samples
during cold crystallization; similar spectra are obtained for the
other CNC-ﬁlled composites and the results are not shown for
brevity. The absence of 911 cm1 absorbance peak suggests the
exclusive formation of a-form sPS during 1st heating scan. Cold-
crystallization process is recognized by the increase of the inte-
grated area of 1222 cm1 peak (A1222), accompanying with
a gradual band shift from 906 to 903 cm1. Further band shift takes
place during heating to 901.5 cm1 prior to crystal melting at
w250 C, at which spectral recording becomes infeasible due to the

located at a temperature of ca. 270.4 C is seen for the cold-crys-
tallized samples irrespective of the CNC content. Similar results
were reported for the sPS/aPS blend system [35]. From the ther-
modynamic point of view, both Tg and Tm are important parameters
in charactering the crystallization process. The former determines
the lower bound temperature and indicates the level of chain
mobility which is predominant for the cold crystallization.
Conversely, the latter gives the upper bound temperature and is
crucial for the nucleation process for the melt crystallization. The
decrease in Tp,cc implies a promoted process for sPS cold crystalli-
zation, which could be due plausibly to the enhanced chain
mobility. However, as the Tg is practically unchanged after CNC
incorporation, the enhancement of cold crystallization must be
attributed to a better heat conduction owing to the presence of CNC
particles, which activate the crystallization at a lower temperature.
As shown in Fig. 6a, the aspect ratio of carbon tubes does play an
important role in inducing crystallization of sPS. CNTs exhibit
a more effective reduction of Tp,cc due to its network formation for
heat conduction in comparison with CNCs. Indeed, the high aspect
ratio of CNT allows the formation of a percolated structure for heat
transfer at very low volume contents (Fig 1b). A theoretical
consideration of well-dispersed cylindrical ﬁllers with an aspect
ratio of 103 predicts only 0.05 vol.% ﬁllers required to develop the
percolation structure [36]. It is noted that Tp,cc is leveled off at
a ﬁller content of 2 wt% and the Tp,cc reduction can be as high as 16
and 20 C for the CNC- and CNT-ﬁlled composites, respectively.
For the melt crystallization, on the other hand, Tp,mc is shifted
to a higher temperature (Fig. 3b) and the normalized DHmc is
apparently decreased for a given fCNC larger than 1 wt% (Table 1).
The measured values of Tp,mc of sPS/CNT composites are also
shown for comparison in Fig 6b. The effect is less pronounced than
CNC addition despite the addition of CNTs also causes an increase
in the rate of melt crystallization. This may be attributed to the
difference in the ﬁller dispersion. The CNCs with a lower aspect
ratio are likely to disperse more uniformly throughout the samples
than the CNTs, which may readily form agglomerates. Thus, more
effective (primary) nucleation sites are produced in the sPS/CNC
composites to activate and accelerate the crystallization process
for any given ﬁller content. In contrast with the cold crystallization
results (Fig. 3a), Tm of the melt-crystallized samples is increased
with increasing CNC content (Fig. 3c). Melt-crystallized samples
with fCNC lower than 1 wt% always exhibit dual melting peaks,
whereas a single but broad melting peak is observed for
composites with higher CNC content. In other words, the low
melting peak gradually moves to a high temperature and is
eventually merged with the high melting peak when fCNC is 2 wt%
or larger. It should be noted that b-form sPS is favored when
samples are dynamically crystallized from the melt state (Fig. 5).
Due to the elevation of Tp,mc (Fig. 3b), composites with a higher
CNC content will experience a lower supercooling degree as the
equilibrium melting temperature (Tm
0 ) of the b-form crystals
remains intact (as discussed later). This in turn produces thicker
lamellae that are melted away at a higher temperature during
heating.
In a short summary for the dynamic crystallization, the addition
of CNCs up to 1 wt% is found to render a sharp reduction of Tp,cc as
well as a signiﬁcant elevation of Tp,mc. In comparison with those of
neat sPS, the variation degree is ca. 12 and 10 C, respectively. The
present ﬁndings of CNC effects exhibit a distinct difference from
those for the miscible sPS/aPS blends [35]. A negligible variation of
Tg was also found with an increasing aPS content. However, Tp,cc
was shifted to higher temperatures and Tp,mc was gradually
reduced to lower temperatures. Both of these indicate the retar-
dation of sPS crystallization induced either from the glass or from
the melt. In other words, the addition of aPS leads to the dilution of
crystallizable sPS chains and eventually retards the crystallization
rate of sPS. This is in contrast with the effects of CNT incorporation
found in the present study.
3.3. Isothermal crystallization
After obtaining the isothermal crystallization curves at a given
Tc, the crystallization kinetics was studied using the Avrami equa-
tion as expressed by Eq. (2),
1 XðtÞ ¼ exp kðt  tiÞn

(2)
where X(t) is the relative crystallinity, ti and t are the induction time
and crystallization time, respectively, n is the Avrami exponent, and
k is the overall crystallization rate. Based on Eq. (2), by plotting the
ln[ln(1 X(t))] versus ln(t ti) the initial slope gave the exponent
n and value of k was deduced from the intercept. Fig. 7 shows the
derived values of k and n for sPS/CNC composites at different Tc. The
crystallization rate is reduced at high Tc for all the samples studied
and addition of CNCs leads to the enhancement of sPS crystalliza-
tion. An order of magnitude increase in k is found for the
composites with 1 wt% CNCs. It is of interest to note that the
derived Avrami exponent changed fromw2.8 for composites with

crystalline lamellae of matrix polymer in the vicinity of CNTs
because the tube diameter is very small and sample staining is
generally required for a better observation of lamellae. Using
a coagulation process, Zhang et al. [25] prepared CNT ﬁbers with
a diameter of 40 mm from the polypropylene glycol solution con-
taining CNTs with an average of 10 nm diameter and 1.0 mm length.
These micron-sized CNT ﬁbers were the ﬁrst evidence to demon-
strate its ability to develop PP transcrystallinty on its surface.
However, it should be noted that the as-prepared CNT ﬁbers
essentially possessed a rough ‘‘ﬁber surface’’ (Fig. 2a, Ref. [25])
which might preserve the residual nuclei surviving at the melt
temperature for the later crystallization. Up to recently, the
nucleation ability of individual CNT is clearly ‘‘seen’’ under TEM
observations on the basis of solution crystallization. It exhibited
a shish-kebab-like structure with PE lamellae as the kebab growing
perpendicularly to the shish CNT [18,19]. Based on the ‘‘size-
dependent soft epitaxy’’ concept, many PE segments, with their
chains parallel to the CNT axis, are deposited along the CNT surface
to serve as the nucleation sites for later chain folding to develop PE
kebab. Similar morphologies with CNT shish were provided from
the Nylon 66/glycerin solution [19]. It is important to note that the
shish CNTs are decorated periodically with the crystalline kebab by
a distance as small as 20 nm. This suggested that CNTs (and CNCs)
may provide profound nucleation sites under appropriate condi-
tions to serve as an excellent nucleating agent. In accordance with
the transcrystallinity developed upon the conventional ﬁbers,
similar features have been observed for the CNT-ﬁlled semi-crys-
talline composites except the ‘‘ﬁber-size’’ difference. Based on the
WAXD and small-angle X-ray scattering, Haggenmueller et al. [17]
calculated the c-axis orientation factor of PE crystals in the pres-
ence of CNTs and provided the supporting evidence for the
formation of transcrystalline lamellae. That is to say CNTs template
the crystallization of PE not only in the dilute solution but also in
the melt state. Similar nucleation mechanism may develop in the
present sPS/CNC composites, resulting in the change of crystal
growth from three- to two-dimensions as indicated by the change
of the Avrami exponent (Fig. 7b).
Fig. 10a shows the melting behavior of sPS/CNC¼ 95/5
composites after being completely crystallized at various Tc. The
effects of CNC content on the melting behavior of composites melt-
crystallized at 256 C are displayed in Fig. 10b. Fig. 10a shows three
melting peaks that were detected for samples that were crystal-
lized at 244 C. They are denoted by Ta, Tml and Tmh from low to high
temperatures. As Tc increases, Tml is gradually shifted to a higher
temperature and is eventually merged with Tmh. However, Tmh is
independent of Tc. Moreover, Ta is always observed right above Tc
and becomes more obvious at high Tc. Similar Tc effects have been
observed in the other sPS/CNC composites. According to Fig. 10b,
the appearance of Ta is more obscured for composites with less CNC
content. A barely seen Ta is detected for the neat sPS sample.
The equilibrium melting temperature Tm
0 is the most important
parameter for a crystallizable polymer because its crystallization
kinetic is strongly related to the supercooling degree, DT deﬁned by
Tm
0  Tc. To determine Tm0 , Hoffman–Weeks equation is frequently
applied and expressed as follows [38],
Tm ¼ T0mð1 1=gÞ þ Tc=g (3)
where Tm is the observed melting temperature of a crystal devel-
oped at a temperature of Tc, and g is the thickening coefﬁcient.
Based on Eq. (3), a linear extrapolation of observed Tm as a function
of Tc interests the Tm¼ Tc line at a point, which provides the value of
Tm
0 . Fig. 11 shows the Tc dependence of melting peak temperatures
for sPS/CNC composites. It is noted that regardless of the different
CNC contents all composites show a superposition of the measured
Ta, Tml and Tmh and each master curve can be constructed. This
suggests that CNC addition plays no inﬂuence on the melting of
crystalline lamellae, and the lamellar thickness may remain intact.
3.4. Possible origin of annealing peak, Ta
A linear line with a slope of unity is found between Ta and Tc, and
Ta is always ca. 4.0 0.3 C above Tc. Up to now, no report has been
presented in the literature for the appearance of Ta in the sPS
samples. However, the presence of annealing peak has been
described in some details for certain semi-stiff polymers, such as
iPS [39–42], poly(ether ether ketone) [43], and poly(ethylene
terephthalate) [44]. One hypothesis for Ta is ascribed to the pres-
ence of the rigid amorphous phase existing between the mobile
amorphous phase and the crystalline lamellar phase. Based on the
TEM observations, Liu et al. [39,40] showed no morphological
variation by holding iPS samples at a temperature slightly higher
than Ta for a short time. They concluded that the annealing peak is
not associated with the melting of subsidiary crystals but resulted
from the nonreversible relaxation process of rigid amorphous
phase. Xu et al. [41] made a similar conclusion on the basis of their

sPS/CNC composites obtained by TEM are shown in Fig. 13. As
expected, neat sPS exhibits an ordered lamellar morphology. This
morphology persists qualitatively in composites with lower CNC
contents (99.9/0.1 and 99.5/0.5 samples). Higher loading of CNCs
leads to the randomly oriented lamellar stacks with reduced lateral
dimensions. Some large amorphous pockets can be readily
observed at the impingement of the growing lamellar stacks. It is
proposed that some crystallizable sPS chains (or segments) may be
trapped in these lamella-free pockets due to the overwhelming
primary nucleation. Likewise, they have difﬁculties in forming
a new lamella due to the constraints from the neighboring lamellae.
In spite of the restricted mobility resulting from the geometrical
conﬁnements, these trapped sPS chains (or segments)may undergo
short range motion to develop a less perfect crystallite like an
aggregate of chains having certain level of crystallographic packing
in directions parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis. These
fringe-miscelle-like micro-crystals may not be readily detected by
the WAXD and TEM due to its imperfect structure. However, DSC is
sensitive enough to trace its melting by the appearance of the small
annealing peak at Ta.
Based on the TEM micrographs shown in Fig. 13, the average
lamellar thickness, lc, was obtained from a collection of w300
lamella population and the results are also tabulated in Table 2. This
was in conjunction with their corresponding melting temperature
determined from DSC heating scan. It is of signiﬁcance to note that
lc remains unchanged (w7.2 nm) regardless of the CNC content. A
slight variation of Tm is observed but the CNC effect is marginal. This
is in a fair agreement with the lc results. TGA was performed on
composites to investigate the CNC effects on the thermal stability of
the sPS matrix. The resulting curves are shown in Fig. 14. For the
neat CNCs, two-stage weight loss is observed from the TGA curve
(not shown). A relatively fast degradation is ﬁrst seen at 200 C
until 320 C, where a mild degradation is followed up to
a temperature of 800 C. It should be noted that the ﬁrst stage
involves with the degradation of the –COOH functional groups on
the surface-treated CNC, and about 82 wt% of CNC is remained at
800 C. For the composites, the weights remaining at 500 C are
almost entirely due to the remaining CNCs and its amount is
consistent with the initial CNC loading. The temperatures at 5%
weight loss, Td, are determined from the curves and are displayed in
Fig. 13. TEM micrographs of sPS/CNC composites. The scale bar is 100 nm and the arrows point out the location of CNCs.

Abstract: 
The 240th National Meeting and Exposition of American Chemical Society (ACS) was held in Boston, 
USA from August 22 to 26. Thanks to the financial support from the National Science Council, I had an 
opportunity to attend this conference meeting and gave an oral presentation of our recent work on the 
development of electrospinning process, which is supported by NSC. 
My presentation was scheduled on August 23 morning in section E of Polymer Chemistry Division from 
11:25 to 11:45, and the title is “Electrospun syndiotactic polystyrene fibers: solvent-induced crystallization”.  
It seemed that some attentions have been paid by the attendee; after my talk, several questions were raised in a 
limited time left.  Indeed, still some participants were quite interested in our electrospinning work and

For this symposium, there were also several other sections (topics); i.e., 
 ten orals on the section of General Topics in the Design and Synthesis of Polymers (Sunday morning), 
 five orals on the section of General Topics in the Characterization of Polymers (Sunday afternoon), 
 five orals on the section of General Topics in the Characterization of Polymers (Monday morning), 
  
Basically, it’s a successful symposium to gather together all the research people around the world, who 
are currently working on the fields of characterization of polymer related materials.       
    After my presentation, several questions were raised by different persons in a limited time left. They 
were the characterization methods for describing the solvent desorption mechanism and the possible 
application fields for our electrospun sPS nanofibers. Since we had already resolved these problems and 
carried out a detailed study on the development of electrospinning process, it became quite apparent that my 
answers to these comments are satisfactorily accepted. Indeed, still some participants were quite interested in 
our electrospinning work and discussed on the processing problems during the intermission. 
 
二、與會心得 
    It’s always good to share the research findings and idea with others, especially in an international 
conference such as ACS meeting that I attended this time. By attending the conference, some new concepts 
and research progress around the world will be absorbed and soon might become the new driving force and 
idea for my research career. Another good opportunity is to meet the people around the world who have a 
similar expertise and research interest. By discussing in the conference and further communicating after the 
conference, a strong bond relation will be built up for the later collaboration. Therefore, I usually go abroad 
and attend the international conference at least once in a year to further broadening and strengthening my 
research level. 
    I sincerely appreciated NSC for partially supporting my trip to the States to attend this ACS meeting.  
Indeed, some good responses in the meeting are undoubtedly expected.      
三、建議 
    To attend the conference held abroad is a good chance not only for the university faculty but also for 
the graduate students, especially those in the PhD program, to realize the new research progress and 
achievements in the world. Under this consideration, the priority and financial support for attending 
international conference should be raised and announced to encourage researchers for going abroad. At 
least, people in the conference will recognize more about Taiwan and where National Cheng Kung 
University is!

process of the absorbed solvent molecules. At this stage, it is rather difficult to 
distinguish the one from the other. 
 
Kinetics of solvent desorption. After solvent absorption was completed, 
subsequent desorption of solvent was carried out by removing the solvent-
treated fibers from the solvent chamber to ambient atmosphere (in the absence 
of solvent vapors). In-situ FTIR measurement was conducted to trace the 
characteristic solvent band. The desorption kinetics were assumed to follow a 
mass-transfer model, 
     / 1 exp( )t oM M kt= − −               (2) 
where kd is the desorption rate constant, Mt and Mo are the area of solvent band 
at a time of t and zero, respectively. According to Equation (2), a plot of ln (1-
Mt/Mo) versus time is constructed and the slope gives the value of kd. Figure 
3(b) shows the desorption curves of toluene and o-DCB solvents. During the 
initial period, the characteristic bands of toluene at 465 cm-1 and o-DCB at 
1130 cm-1 decreased in intensity remarkably. After this, a gradual reduction of 
band intensity was observed. This behavior suggested that two different 
desorption stages (I, and II) are involved, and their corresponding rate 
constants (kdI, kdII) are separately derived from the slopes. Table 1 displays the 
results. Based on the derived rate constants, desorption of toluene from the 
fibers is faster than that of o-DCB. Regardless of solvents used, kdI is larger 
than kdII. The transition from stage I to II occurs at the Mt/Mo value of 0.54 
after 7.3 h desorption of toluene. However, it takes 15.7 h for the o-DCB 
system to reach the transition at a Mt/Mo value of 0.74. Our results imply that 
there are two possible locations for the initially-adsorbed solvent molecules to 
exist, i.e., in the amorphous phase as well as in the crystalline phase. 
Desorption at stage I is associated with the solvent escape from the amorphous 
phase, whereas stage II is relevant with that from the crystalline phase. The 
variation in the transition Mt/Mo value between the toluene and o-DCB system 
may also indicate the difference in the crystalline fraction developed in the 
initial fibers. It is of significance to note that all the solvent molecules 
initially-absorbed in the fiber can be naturally expelled. In other words, sPS 
fibers with δe-form crystals are eventually obtained at the end of desorption 
experiment (ca. several days). 
 
Conclusions 
High-temperature electrospinning of sPS solutions became feasible by 
using a jacket-type heat exchanger to control the solution temperature. The as-
spun sPS fibers were amorphous. Under suitable solvent treatment at room 
temperature, the amorphous sPS chains rapidly crystallized to form the sPS 
clathrate.  
The included solvents could be removed. By repetitive absorption and 
desorption of the desired solvent liquids (or vapors), these sPS fiber mats with 
clathrate structure are promising in the application of chemical separation. The 
induction time was longer and the crystallization rate became lower as the 
lower saturated vapor pressure of organic solvent on the exposure of 
amorphous fibers to solvent vapor. On the exposure of  δ form fibers to air, a 
gradual desorption of the guest molecules was observed at room temperature. 
Finally, all of solvent molecules in the fibers evaporate and the δ form 
transfers to the δe form.
