Al/iZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2/Mo/glass in which CdS film is 
generally formed by chemical bath deposition (CBD) and the other 
films are deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD)method. It is 
well known that PVD needs expensive vacuum equipment； The 
process for PVD is also quite complicated； It is not easy to form a 
large area of film by PVD； The CdS film in CIGS solar is toxic to 
human body. To improve these shortages of typical CIGS solar cell 
stated above, the present research project is then brought up.  
In this work single-step electrodeposition method was used to 
deposit four elements simultaneously for the synthesis of 
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film, CBD method was used to deposit 
nanocrystalline zinc sulfide (ZnS) thin films, and  sol-gel method 
was used to synthesis transparent aluminum doped zinc oxide 
(ZnO:Al, AZO) with 450 nm thickness for large scale production of 
CIGS solar cell. The experimental results showed that the 
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 phase was deposited 1.5-2 μm thickness with a 
preferred plane (112). The optimum parameters for synthesis an 
ideal chemical composition of CIGS were presented. The growth 
behavior containing deposit morphology, growth rate, structure and 
optical properties of ZnS thin films within 100 nm thick are 
investigated. The TEM diffraction patterns and XRD patterns 
revealed that ZnS films were nanocrystallines, of which FCC (111) 
phase dominated. The grow rate and transmittance of ZnS thin films 
are 0.88nm/min and over 80%, respectively. The ZnS/CIGS/FTO 
structure and Al:ZnO/ZnO/ZnS structure in CIGS solar cell formed 
by wet processes showed well heterointerfaces. The AZO films 
were wurtzite crystalline with C axis preferred orientation and had 
above 85% transmittance and lower electrical resistivity after 
annealed in N2 atmosphere. The optimum AZO samples had low 
electrical resistivity 19×10-3 Ωcm.  
In the formation of each film in CIGS solar cell structure, wet 
process was used. Therefore, the cost of equipment can be largely 
decreased, the operation can be largely simplified, and the area of 
formed film can be increased.

Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film for solar cell. The experimental parameters consisted of pH value, main metal ion concentra-
tion ratio, applied voltage, deposition time, annealing temperature and time. The experiments are carried out repeatedly and 
an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to analyze the phases and observe the 
microstructure of CIGS film. The results showed that the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 phase was deposited 1.5-2 μm thickness with a pre-
ferred plane (112). The optimum parameters for synthesis an ideal chemical composition of CIGS were pH value of 3.0, ap-
plied voltage of -1.4V, CuCl2 concentration of 7mM, InCl3 concentration of 30 mM, GaCl3 concentration of 50mM, H2SeO3 
concentration of 5 mM, , deposition time of 3 min., and annealing temperature of 500℃ for 30min.

1. Introduction 
Due to the crisis of petroleum shortage, other energy 
sources have urgently been searched and deeply been re-
searched for replacing petroleum. Among these energy 
sources the thin film solar cell is a promising candidate. 
There are some materials, e.g. CdTe, CdSe, ZnP2, Zn3P2, 
CuInSe2, and CuInGaSe2, which have a direct energy gap 
and then have a relatively large optical absorption coeffi-
cient. They can be used as active materials for thin film 
solar cell. These films can be prepared by various methods, 
e. g. spray pyrolysis [1, 2], molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
[3], vacuum evaporation [4, 5], sublimation [6], chemical 
bath deposition and electrodeposition [7, 8]. 
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film, of which band gap is 
about 1.7 eV and absorption coefficient is larger than 
10-5cm-1, is one of the best absorber materials for use in 
solar cell. It can be prepared by electrodeposition technique 
which has some advantages, e. g. low cost, low operation 
temperature, easy operation, and large deposited area. 
There are many reports concerning the preparation of CIGS 
thin film by electrodeposition [9-12], of which could be 
summarized three processes, one is four- steps: single ele-
ment Cu, In, Ga and Se is electrodeposited step by step, 
which is the most easy method but spent long time and de-
posited too thick film, another is two- steps: both layers 
Cu-In and Cu-Ga are electrodeposited, separately[13], and 
the other is single-step: four elements Cu, In, Ga and Se are 
electrodeposited simultaneously. Single- step process, of 
which is the most difficult technique, due to different re-
duction voltage. But it is the most simple process, could 
avoid Se evaporation containment and cheap for 
mass-production. There are many factors such as electrical 
current density, composition and operation condition of 
plating bath, and annealing condition, etc. which can affect 
the properties of CIGS thin film. Therefore, it is quite dif-
ficult to determine the optimal parameters of single-step 
electrodeposition for the CIGS thin film with good quality. 
In the present work, the preparation and the elecrode-
shows the relation between the chemical composition of 
CIGS samples and applied voltage during electrodeposition. 
The applied voltage increased from -1.0 V to -1.3 V, the 
atomic ratio of Cu and Ga is nearly the same, but the atom-
ic ratio of Se decreased and In increased, and the applied 
voltage ranged from -1.3V to -1.5V, the atomic ratio of all 
elements besides In increased. The CIGS film contained 7.5 
at% Ga, 17.5 at% In and 50 at% Se is fairly near ideal 
CIGS chemical composition, merely the Cu content is  not 
enough, at -1.4V applied voltage. Therefore, to increase the 
concentration of CuCl2, the concentration ratio of CuCl2, 
InCl3, GaCl3 and H2SeO3 is modified to be 1.4:6:10:1 and 
the experimental results were shown in Fig. 3.

ABSTRACT 
CdS buffer layers deposited by chemical bath deposition (CBD) have been used in high-efficiency Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar 
cells. In view of the harmful environmental impact of Cd due to high amount of Cd compound waste from large scale solar cell 
production, Cd-free buffer layers should be developed. In this work CBD method was used to deposit nanocrystalline zinc sulfide 
(ZnS) thin films for CIGS solar cell. The growth behavior containing deposit morphology, growth rate, structure and optical 
properties of ZnS thin films within 100 nm thick are investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), 
Transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM) and ultraviolet visible 
light spectroscope (UV/VIS). The FE-SEM morphologies showed that the impact, even and dense ZnS films were deposited on 
soda lime glass from solution contained high concentration ratio of Thiourea. The TEM diffraction patterns and XRD patterns 
revealed that ZnS films were nanocrystallines, of which FCC (111) phase dominated. The grow rate and transmittance of ZnS thin 
films are 0.88nm/min and over 80%, respectively. The ZnS/CIGS/FTO structure and Al:ZnO/ZnO/ZnS structure in CIGS solar 
cell formed by wet processes showed well heterointerfaces. 
Keywords: ZnS nanocrystalline thin film, chemical bath deposition, growth behavior. 
 
Introduction 
 
Cu(In, Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film solar cell with high 
efficiency of 19.9% has already been achieved[1]. CdS with 
2.4 ev band gap, which is typically used as a buffer layer 
between Cu(In, Ga)Se2 and ZnO, to smooth the band gap 
change, inhibit the recombination of pair of electron-hole and 
improve the lattice match in CIGS solar cell[2]. In view of the 
harmful environmental impact of Cd due to high amount of 
Cd compound waste from large scale solar cell production, 
Cd-free buffer layers should be developed, other II-VI sulfide 
compounds, e.g. ZnO[3], ZnSe[4-5], In(OH)3[6], In2S3[7], 
SnO2[8], and ZnS[9-10], which have been used as a buffer 
layer in CIGS solar cell with a high efficiency of 18.6%[11]. 
The films can be prepared by various methods, e. g. chemical 
bath deposition (CBD), MOCVD, Metal-Organic Vapor Phase 
Epitaxy, Atomic Layer Deposition, Thermal Evaporation, and 
Sputtering Deposition, among these methods CBD is the best 
popular method, due to a uniform film could be easily 
deposited onto CIGS layer.. 
A typical structure of CIGS solar cell is n+ZnO ：
Al/iZnO/CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2/Mo/glass in which CdS film is 
generally formed by chemical bath deposition (CBD) and the 
other films are deposited by physical vapor deposition 
(PVD)method[1,11]. It is well known that PVD needs 
expensive vacuum equipment; The process for PVD is also 
quite complicated; It is not easy to form a large area of film by 
PVD; The CdS film in CIGS solar is toxic to human body. In 
the present work, CBD method is used to prepare the optimal 
ZnS buffer layer for CIGS solar cell, which shows a high 
transmittance in the visible region and very uniform below 
100 nm thick. And the well hetrointerfaces of the 
Al:ZnO/ZnO/ZnS and ZnS/CIGS/FTO structure of CIGS solar 
cell formed by wet processes were observed. 
 
Experimental detail 
 
A glass and  P-type (100)Silicone wafer were used as 
substrates, to observe the room temperature optical property 
by light spectroscope (UV/VIS), and the cross section views 
and the diffraction pattern of ZnS films by Transmission 
Electron Microscope (TEM), respectively. After standard 
cleaning procedure, dipping in an acetone solution with 
ultrasonic vibration for 15 minutes, the FTO substrate was 
then deposited a film of ZnS by CBD technique. The CBD 
bath consisted of ZnSO4, thiourea, and hydrazine of which pH 
value was adjusted at 11.0 by NH4OH solutions. In the CBD 
process, the deposition bath was stirred by magnetic power, 
and then applied at 80 ℃ for 5~60 minutes.  
 The sample of ZnS/FTO was characterized, of which a 
Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) was 
used to observe the morphology and microstructure, an X-ray 
diffactometer (XRD) was used to analyze the crystal structure, 
and Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) to observe the 
roughness of ZnS film. The chemical composition and 
chemical state of the constituent elements of ZnS film at room 
temperature was determined by X-ray Photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS).

Abstract 
Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) deposited by vacuum process with excellent optical and electrical properties have been 
generally used as transparent conductive oxide thin films. In view of high cost and recycles not easily of vacuum process, zinc 
oxide films synthesized by wet chemical process is therefore regarded a more suitable candidate to replace ITO. In this work 
sol-gel method was used to synthesis transparent aluminum doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al, AZO) with 450 nm thickness for large 
scale production of CIGS solar cell. The experimental parameters contained different solvents, the propylene glycol methyl ether 
(PGME) to replace the usually used solvent ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) which is toxic, the amount of doping Al ranged 
from 0 to 2 at %, and various annealing temperature. The structure, electrical and optical properties of AZO thin films are 
investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray 
diffractometer (XRD), four-point probe (FPP) and ultraviolet visible light spectroscope (UV/VIS). The experimental results 
showed the AZO films were wurtzite crystalline with C axis preferred orientation and had above 85% transmittance and lower 
electrical resistivity after annealed in N2 atmosphere. The optimum AZO samples had low electrical resistivity 19×10-3 Ωcm, 
which were synthesized with PGME solvent, doping 1 at% Al and annealed at 600 ℃ in N2 atmosphere and 500 ℃ in 95 N2/5H2 
atmosphere for one hour, separately.  
Keywords: AZO thin film, sol-gel method 
 
Introduction 
 
The fast development of electro-optical semiconductor 
accompany human needs more and more, not only the 
decrease in the dimension of elements in design, and the 
demand of more user-friendly and convenience. The related 
researches were studied and proposed continuously, among 
these researches the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films 
are popularly used in electro-optical devices. TCO film is 
regarded as a film has average transmittance value over 80%, 
high electric conductivity, and its resisitivity is below 
1×10-3Ω-cm.  
TCO are generally classified N-type and P-type according 
to its electric property, and could be subdivided into three 
kinds i.e., doping type, binary and ternary compounds. Among 
these TCO, doping type is in common, e. g. Sb-or F-doped 
SnO2,Sn-doped In2O3,and Al-or Ga-doped ZnO [2-4].There 
are many methods to prepare TCO, e. g. physical methods 
including physical vapor deposition (PVD), electron beam 
deposition (EBD), sputtering, thermal evaporation deposition, 
pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and chemical methods 
including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer 
epitaxy, spray pyrolysis, sol-gel [5-12]. Among these methods, 
only magnetron sputter and sol-gel methods were suitable to 
be used in large produces. Especially, the magnetron sputter is 
popularly used in industry, due to its parameters could be 
exactly controlled. It is well known that magnetron sputter 
needs expensive vacuum equipment; The maintain and target 
cost of magnetron sputter is also quite expensive. But the 
electric conductivity of TCO films with resistivity below 
10-4Ω·cm produced by magnetron sputter is better than those 
produced by sol-gel method; The problem needs to be 
overcome [13-14].  
In the present work, sol-gel method is used to prepare the 
AZO films, due to merits of low work temperature, easy 
operation, large scale production, and cost down for CIGS 
solar cell. EGME is generally used as solvent to prepare 
Al-doped ZnO (AZO) by sol-gel method [15-17]. In view of 
the poison of EGME, it is harmful to human health even to 
environmental [18]. There are few reports to use PGME as a 
solvent, the present study to synthesis AZO films by using 
PGME and investigate the microstructure, electric and optical 
properties. 
 
Experimental  
 
AZO thin film was synthesized by the sol-gel method. Zinc 
acetate was used as a starting material. PGME and MEA were 
used as a solvent and stabilizer, separately. Aluminum was 
doped by adding Al(NO3)3 into solution with various Al/Zn 
ratios, i. e., 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 ,and 2 at%. A solution contains 
0.75 M Zn2+ was prepared by adding exact amount of Zinc 
acetate into PGME solvent, and the solution was stirred until it 
completely dissolved, and then be dipped MEA drop by drop 
with equal molar as Zinc acetate. And then the solution was 
added Al(NO3)3, stirred fast for 1hr. and finally kept at room 
temperature for one day.  
    A soda lime glass as the substrate was rinsed with 
deionized water after each cleaning step. After dried in oven 
the substrate was then fixed at the spin base and spun coated 
AZO film in a series of at a r.p.m. of 700 for 10 sec followed 
at a r.p.m. of 3000 for 20sec. After deposited  AZO the 
sample was then dried in an oven at 170  ℃ for 10 min. The 
coating and firing cycles were repeated 10 times to attain 
films about 450 nm thick. Finally, the AZO samples were 
annealed first at temperatures ranging from 450 to 650 ℃ in

A structure of Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si was first formed and then annealed at various temperatures for 5 minutes in a rapid thermal 
annealing furnace with an atmosphere of Ar+H2(5 vol%). In Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structure, the ITO(10 nm) film was coated on Si 
substrate by sputtering process and the Cu film was deposited on ITO film by electroplating technique . The various Cu/ITO(10 
nm)/Si samples were characterized by a four-point probe, a scanning electron microscope, an X-ray diffractometer, and a 
transmission electron microscope. The results showed that in the annealing process for the electroplating Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si 
structure in Ar+H2(5 vol%), when the temperature is increased to about 600 ℃, the ITO film becomes unstable, the Cu film 
begins to agglomerate, and the diffusion of Cu and Si atoms through the ITO film takes place; and when the temperature reaches 
to about 700 ℃, the Cu film becomes a net and the sheet resistance increases abruptly.

1. Introduction 
With the decrease in the dimension of elements in 
high-level integrated circuits, the metal interconnection has 
introduced some limiting factors such as RC delay, IR drop, 
and electromigration, which would degrade the performance 
of integrated circuits [1]. Cu is superior to Al in the respects 
of RC delay and electromigration, but when it is deposited 
directly on Si, there has a serious diffusion problem with Cu 
[2]. Because Cu easily diffuses in Si and reacts with Si to 
form various copper silicides, a very thin and efficient barrier 
is required to hinder the interdiffusion of Cu and Si for the 
future IC generations. The thermodynamical stability, 
amorphous structure, low electrical resistance, reasonable 
thermal conductivity, good adhesion to the surrounding met-
als, and low stresses are the required characteristics for the 
materials as barrier to efficiently prevent the interdiffusion 
between Cu and Si [3, 4]. There are many materials have been 
studied and developed for being a diffusion barrier against Cu, 
such as W, Ta, Zr, TaNi, TiW, TiSi2, TaN, TiN, TaC, ZrC, 
TaSiW, CoWP, and WNxCy[5-17]. The predominant industry 
solution for the diffusion barrier material for Cu metallization 
is TaN/Ta [2]. For electroplating Cu interconnector on Ta and 
TaN diffusion barrier, a Cu seed layer is necessary [18]. Al-
ternatively, a thin layer of Ru can be also used as the diffusion 
barrier and allow direct electroplating Cu on the barrier 
without Cu seed layer [19, 20]. 
   Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is an important material for 
photoelectric device, electroluminescene device, and strain 
gauge [21-24] due to its several features such as low electrical 
resistance, high chemical stability, large gage factor, good 
adherence to various substrates, and others. ITO is also used 
as diffusion barrier for Cu metallization [25-27]. Liu et al. 
have formed a Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structure by sputtering 
process and demonstrated that ITO is a good diffusion barrier 
against Cu at least up to 650 ℃ [25]. In this work , we also 
formed a Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structure, but the Cu film was 
directly deposited on ITO by electroplating process replacing 
the expensive sputtering process. The failure behavior of ITO 
diffusion barrier between electroplating Cu and Si Substrate 
annealed in an atmosphere of Ar+H2(5 vol%) was in detail 
investigated. 
2. Experimental  
2.1 Preparation of Cu/ITO/Si samples 
   A p-type (100) Si wafer as the substrate was first cleansed 
by the RCA process, i.e., successively dipped in acetone 
solution with supersonic vibration for 15 minutes, in a mix-
ture solution of H2SO4 and H2O2(H2SO4:H2O2=1:1) for 10 
minutes, in 10 % HF solution for 2 minutes. The substrate 
was rinsed with deionized water after each cleaning step. 
After dried in N2 stream the substrate was then put in a 
sputtering deposition chamber for coating ITO film. The 
deposition process was carried out in Ar gas with a working 
pressure of 4×10-3 torr. The power and the deposition time 
were adjusted so that an ITO film 10 nm in thickness can be 
obtained. 
A Cu film about 200 nm in thickness was deposited on 
ITO film by electrodeposition technique. The deposition bath 
This demonstrates the amount of Cu in the area of X-ray 
irradiation is decreasing due to the agglomeration of Cu film 
and the formation of copper silicides, as shown in fig.4 
(d)~(h). Only the peak of Cu4Si, the second phase, emerges 
in the XRD pattern of the sample annealed at 800 ℃. 
However, the second phase particle has been formed as early 
as the annealing temperature increases to 650 ℃ as shown 
in Fig.4 (c). The missing of the second phase peaks in the 
XRD pattern of samples annealed at 650, 700, and 750 ℃ 
can be attributed that the amount of the second phase is too 
small to be detected by XRD. It should be noted that the 
XRD peaks of Cu (111) and Cu (200) shift to the smaller 
Bragg angle when the annealing temperature is 600, 650, 
700 and 750 ℃, and again shift to the normal position at 
800 ℃. The peak shift means that the spacing of the Cu 
lattice planes is increased at 600~750 ℃, and is restored at 
800 ℃ due to the diffusion of some extrinsic atoms into 
and out the Cu lattice, respectively. 
   Fig.6 shows the TEM cross-sectional views for the 
Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structures (a) at the as-deposited state, 
and annealed for 5 minutes in a RTA furnace with an at-
mosphere of Ar+H2(5 vol%), at (b)500, (c)600, (d)650, 
(e)700, (f)750, and (g)800 ℃, respectively. The ITO film 
lies quite flatly between Cu film and Si substrate in the 
Cu/ITO(10 nm)/Si structure at the as-deposited state, as 
shown in Fig.6 (a), and annealed at 500 ℃, as shown in 
Fig.6 (b). The thickness of ITO film in Cu/ITO (10 nm)/Si 
annealed at 600 ℃ becomes non-uniform, as shown in 
Fig.6 (c). There are many shadows across the ITO film in 
Fig.6 (a), and (c), which are formed by the impinging of ion 
beam in the preparation process for TEM samples.

there are spherical particles dispersed on the sample surface 
and there are bundles of nanowires grown from these parti-
cles. When the annealing temperature is increased to 800 ℃, 
a part of Cu net disappears, the amount of the spherical par-
ticles become more, and the nanowire bundles become more 
dense, as shown is Fig.4(g) and (h). Fig.4 (h) is an enlarge-
ment of Fig.4 (g).

(111) and Cu (200) appear in all XRD patterns, and their 
intensity decreases with increase in annealing temperature 
when the annealing temperature is higher than 650 ℃.

Abstract 
In this work single-step electrodeposition method was used to deposit four elements simultaneously for the synthesis of 
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film for solar cell. The experimental parameters consisted of pH value, main metal ion concentra-
tion ratio, applied voltage, deposition time, annealing temperature and time. The experiments are carried out repeatedly and 
an X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to analyze the phases and observe the 
microstructure of deposited film. The results showed that the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 phase was deposited 1.5-2 μm thickness with a 
preferred plane (112). The optimum parameters for the synthesis an ideal composition ratio of CIGS were pH value of 3.0, 
applied voltage of -1.4 V, CuCl2 concentration of 7 mM, InCl3 concentration of 30 mM, GaCl3 concentration of 50 mM, 
H2SeO3 concentration of 5 mM, , deposition time of 3 min. and annealing temperature of 450℃, 30 min. 
 
Keywords: Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS), single-step electrodeposition, thin film solar cell. 
 
1.Introduction 
Due to the crisis of petroleum shortage, other energy 
sources have urgently been searched and deeply been re-
searched for replacing petroleum. Among these energy 
sources the thin film solar cell is a promising candidate. 
There are some materials, e.g. CdTe, CdSe, ZnP2, Zn3P2, 
CuInSe2, and CuInGaSe2, which have a direct energy gap 
and then have a relatively large optical absorption coeffi-
cient. They can be used as active materials for thin film 
solar cell. These films can be prepared by various methods, 
e. g. spray pyrolysis [1, 2], molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) 
[3], vacuum evaporation [4, 5], sublimation [6], chemical 
bath deposition and electrodeposition [7, 8]. 
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) thin film, of which band gap is 
about 1.7 eV and absorption coefficient is larger than 
10-5cm-1, is one of the best absorber materials for use in 
solar cell. It can be prepared by electrodeposition technique 
which has some advantages, e. g. low cost, low operation 
temperature, easy operation, and large deposited area. 
There are many reports concerning the preparation of CIGS 
thin film by electrodeposition [9-12], of which could be 
summarized three processes, one is four- steps: single ele-
ment Cu, In, Ga and Se is electrodeposited step by step, 
which is the most easy method but wastes long time and 
has exera thickness, another is two- steps: both layers Cu-In 
and Cu-Ga are electrodeposited[13], and the other is sin-
gle-step: four elements Cu, In, Ga and Se are electrodepos-
ited simultaneously. Single- step process, of which is the 
most difficult technique, due to different reduction voltage. 
But it is a the most simple process, could avoid Se evapora-
tion containment and cheap for mass-production. And there 
are many factors such as electrical current density, compo-
sition and operation condition of plating bath, and anneal-
ing condition, etc. which can affect the properties of CIGS 
thin film. Therefore, it is quite difficult to determine the 
optimal parameters of single-step electrodeposition for the 
tion of higher pH value. The atomic ratio of Cu, In Ga and 
Se at pH 3.0 is near ideal CIGS chemical composition.  
Fig. 2 shows the relation between the chemical composition 
of CIGS samples and applied voltage during electrodepo-
tion. The applied voltage increased from -1.0 V to -1.3 V, 
the atomic ratio of Cu and Ga is nearly the same, but the 
atomic ratio of Se decreased and In increased, and the ap-
plied voltage ranged from -1.3V to -1.5V, the atomic ratio 
of all elements besides Se increased. The CIGS film con-
tained 7.5 at% Ga, 17.5 at% In and 50 at% Se is fairly near 
ideal CIGS chemical composition, merely the Cu content is 
enough, at -1.4V applied voltage. Therefore, the concentra-
tion of CuCl2 is lifted and the concentration ratio of CuCl2, 
InCl3, GaCl3 and H2SeO3 is modified to be 1.4:6:10:1, as 
shown in Fig. 3. `

structure by XRD. Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns which 
reveal Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (112) phase appeared after annealed at 
350, 450, and 550 ℃, but disappeared at 650 ℃. The in-

Various structures of Cu (50nm)/ Ru (2nm)/ MgO (0.5~3nm)/ Ta (2nm)/ Si were prepared by sputtering and 
electroplating techniques, in which the ultra-thin trilayer of Ru (2nm)/ MgO (0.5~3nm)/ Ta (2nm) is used as 
the diffusion barrier against the interdiffusion between Cu film and Si substrate. The various structures of 
Cu/Ru/MgO/Ta/Si were characterized by four-point probes for their sheet resistances, by X-ray diffractometers 
for their crystal structures, by scanning electron microscopes for their surface morphologies, and by 
transmission electron microscopes for their cross-section and high resolution views. The results showed that 
the as deposited MgO and Ta layers are amorphous. The failure of the diffusion barrier is due that the Ru layer 
first become discontinuous, then the Cu atoms diffuse to Si substrate at the discontinuities, the Cu3Si phase 
form, and the diffusion barrier finally failed. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Regarding diffusion barrier layers for copper 
metallization in VLSI, it is quite important to find an 
appropriate material as an effective diffusion barrier 
between copper and silicon. The diffusion barrier 
should possess some features which include[1,2]：
thermodynamically stable when in contact with Cu 
and Si, amorphous structure to prevent diffusion 
along the grain boundaries, good adhesion between 
the barrier and the surrounding material, having an 
electrochemical potential similar to that of Cu and Si 
to avoid the formation of galvanic cells, low stress in 
the barrier material, low resistance contact with Cu 
and Si, and reasonable thermal conductivity. 
Up to now there are many materials which have 
been studied and developed to be used as diffusion 
barrier against the interdiffusion between Cu and Si, 
such as W, Ta, Zr, TaNi, TiW, TaN, TiN, TaSiNi, 
CoW,[3] Ta-Si-N, W-B-N, Mo-V-N, Al-Cr-Ta, 
Ti-Zr-N, Al-Mo-Nb-Si-Ta-Ti-V-Zr-N, and so on.[4] 
Furthermore, the thickness of diffusion barrier is 
decreased with the decrease of integrated circuit size. 
For examples, a 10nm-thick Ru-Ti-N film as a 
diffusion barrier was prepared and studied by Kwon 
et al.,[5] and 15nm-thick Ru-N and Ru-Ta-N films 
have been deposited and applied as diffusion 
barrier.[6] 
Magnesia (MgO) is a well-known refractory 
oxide which has a melting point of 2800 ℃, an 
optical band gap of 7.2 eV, an optical absorption 
coefficient/cm (7μm) of 0.05, and a dielectric 
constant of 9.8.[7] MgO thin films have been widely 
used as chemically stable buffer layers for the 
deposition of high Tc superconducting films and 
perovskite-type ferroelectric films, a protecting layer 
of dielectrics.[8] MgO thin films are also used to 
catalyze the H2 and O2 exchange reaction.[9] It has 
been shown that Mn dose not appear to diffuse into 
the MgO barrier in annealed magnetic tunnel 
junctions with MgO tunnel barrier.[10] 
The electrical conductivity of MgO film is quite low. 
However, the ultra-thin MgO film has good electric 
conductivity due to the dissipation of electrical 
charge via the metallic substrate[11] and due to the 
tunneling effect.[12] In the present work, the 
structures of Cu(50μm)/Ru(2nm)/MgO(0.5~3nm)/Ta 
(2nm)/Si were prepared, in which the ultra-thin 
multilayer of Ru(2nm)/MgO(0.5~3nm)/Ta(2nm) is 
used as the diffusion barrier against the 
interdiffusion between Cu and Si. The effect of the 
thickness of ultra-thin MgO films on the failure 
behavior of Ru/MgO/Ta diffusion barrier between 
electroplating Cu and Si substrate annealed in a low 
vacuum was in detail investigated. 
 
2. Experimental 
 
 The substrate for the deposition of Ta, MgO, Ru, 
and Cu thin films is a p-type (100) Si wafer which 
was first cleansed by the RCA process, i.e., 
successively dipped in an acetone solution with 
supersonic vibration for 15 minutes, in a mixture 
solution of H2SO4 and H2O2 (H2SO4 : H2O2 = 1:1) 
for 10minutes, and in a HF solution (10%) for 2 
minutes. After each step the Si substrate was rinsed 
with deionized water. The Si substrate was finally 
dried in N2 stream. 
The Si substrate was then put in a sputtering 
chamber for the deposition of Ta, MgO, and Ru 
ultra-thin films. The deposition process was carried
