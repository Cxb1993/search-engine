Abstract
A series of low-rise buildings models aerodynamic experiments will be conducted in wind
tunnel to investigate the surface pressures characteristics. The pressure signals are recorded
simultaneously and the pressure coefficients, peak value, coherent structure will be analysis to
construct the data base for wind loadings evaluation models. The results shown, the area under
most extremely wind pressures on the gable roof type and hip roof type buildings is on the front
area with building height band. Especially, the highest peak wind pressures were found in the
corner of roof when the angle of wind between ridge of roof is small. A pod method was adopted
to explore the basic modes of pressure field on the building surfaces. The results shown, over 90%
of energy were contained in the first 5 modes. A well trained artificial neural network was
constructed with the experimental data. The predicted average pressure coefficients and
fluctuating pressure coefficients were quite similar to the measured values. In the ANN training
process, the Levenberg-Marquardt scheme was proved to be the most efficiency method.

ABSTRACT
A series of wind tunnel aerodynamic experiments were conducted to investigate the wind
loads on the low-rise industrial buildings with arched roofs. Three types of roof curved roofs
models were tested. Simultaneous wind pressures over all of the models surfaces were measured
with the electronic scani-valves system in a simulated open terrain exposure atmospheric boundary
layer. With these data the pressures data were analysis by the proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) method to investigate the surface pressure modes distribution in the first step. Then the
equivalent static wind loads (ESWL) of fluctuating wind pressures acting on buildings frames were
evaluated by the LRC method and the results of equivalent static wind loads were compared with
the 2006 version design codes of wind loadings on buildings in Taiwan. The design codes
suggested the direction of wind acting on the low-rise buildings with arched roofs were normal to
the ridges of roofs. In this study results shown, in the case of wind loadings by wind direction
parallel to the ridges of roofs will also cause lots of larger structural loadings on buildings. With
this point of view, the more loading case should be considered.
INTRODUCTION
In Taiwan area lots of low-rise industrial buildings are suffered and damaged by the Typhoon
every year, so the wind resistant design of structures are important considerations in the buildings
design procedures. The height-to-width ratio of most low-rise industrial buildings is less then 1,
and they are always located in the bottom part of atmospheric boundary layer. The buildings are
acted by high intense turbulence and may cause some special aerodynamic phenomenon that is
quite different from the high-rise buildings.
Most of structural systems that used in the industrial buildings are the simple supported steel
frames system in Taiwan, and the buildings are covered and bolted with thin steel plates. Before
the buildings are damaged by the strong turbulence the buildings can be treated as the enclosed

Three different rise-to-span ratio arch roof buildings are used for the aerodynamics
experiments in this study. The variant parameters of model dimensions included the rise-to-span
ratio (r) of arched roofs and the height-to-depth ratio (h/D) of buildings. The models are made by
acrylic plates with uniform distribution pressure taps on all of the models surfaces. The variant
rise-to-span ratios of arched roofs of models included 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5. As well as combined
with the two height-to-depth ratio, which are 2 and 4, there are six kinds of models used in the
research. The height of side wall of buildings models is 10 cm and the width is 20 cm for each
models. A hot-wire probe connected with the DANTEC 9090N10101 anemometer is set at the
roof height and five times of building width beside the model to monitor the flow field data. In the
experiments, the static pressure of Pitote tube which set beyond the free stream area at up stream of
test section is took as reference pressure in the pressure measuring procedures.

Figure1 The definitions of building models dimensions
The experimental pressures data were collected via the tubing system which made by 20 cm
long and 1mm inner diameter PVC tubing system. The tubing system has been test with white
noise signals to check the distortion of signals and the results shown that the non-distortion signal
can be get under 35 Hz. The simultaneous pressure signals of models were collected by the
electron scanivalves system. Due to the limitation of pressure taps is 256 ports in this laboratory,
and the pressure taps used in the experiments were no more then 240. The reference speed of test
is 9.8 m/sec, and the Reynolds number calculated with the height of roof ridge is about 135,000.
The sampling rate of A/D is set on 250Hz; duration of sampling for each test is 264 seconds.
Data analysis
In the analysis of pressure data, the mean and fluctuating pressure coefficients of taps at each
face of model were analysis firstly and the peak value of pressure coefficients were estimated also.
On the consideration of maximum wind loadings, the covariance integration method is adopted.
The definitions of calculated pressure coefficients are stated as below.

Figure3 The locations of three simple supported frames and the definitions of structural moments in
frames.
The main wind resistance structure system of buildings is set as simple support frame for the
maximum wind loading analysis in this study. Three frames located at front, middle and rear
regions of buildings respect along the direction of ridge of roof are took as analysis targets for
comparison. The locations of three frames are also shown in figure 3.
Results and discussion
The surface pressures on the buildings with arched roof were measured and discussed to
investigate the vortex effect on these low-rise buildings. After the comprehending of surface
pressures, the spatial correlations were took account to estimate the equivalent static wind loads.
The characteristics of surface pressures
The characteristics of surface pressures on buildings can reflect the direct turbulent effects on
buildings and could be the important data which are used in the cladding design. In order to
understand how the curvature of roofs would affect the aerodynamic characteristics on roofs, three
different rise-to-span ratios (r) of arched roof buildings are test. In the case of wind direction
normal to the ridge of roofs, the distributions of mean pressures coefficients are shown as figure 4.
As it shown, there are positive pressures distributed in the upstream region of roof, almost one third
area of the roof, in the case of r=0.5. In the mean while the mean pressures on the roofs of other
models are all negative. The high rise-to-span ratio could cause the on coming flow turbulence
directly acting on upstream region of roof, and the separation line of shear layer will be moved
close to the ridge. In the lower rise-to-span ratio cases, the separation line of shear layer will be
occurred at the demarcation line of building wall and roof.
In the cases of wind direction parallel to the ridge of roofs, the distributions of mean
pressures coefficients are shown as figure5. As figure 5 shown, the distribution types of mean
pressures seem to be quite similar to each others. Only at the up stream region of roof are different,
the suction pressure acting stronger at the cases of r=0.125. The similar situations are also
appeared on the surface pressures of side walls, but the most serious suction pressures are appeared
on the models with r=0.5. We can reason that the higher rise-to-span ratio would keep the vortex
shedding at side walls more complete and cause the more suction pressures. In the consideration
of design wind loadings conditions, the higher rise-to-span ratio might cause higher structural
loadings in the case of wind direction along with the ridge of roof.
9at the up stream region of roof of lower rise-to-span ratio models and also at the demarcation lines
of roof and side wall. There are positive peak pressures on the one to fourth roof region of up
stream of buildings models with r=0.5 and after this region the peak pressure turn into negative to
down stream. For the frame structures of these series buildings the wind loads will be combined
with positives and negatives. This situation may cause the adverse loading cases to the main wind
resistance system. At the side walls, the upper stream region has been appeared the serious
suction peak pressure. Consequence, the cladding and components design at this region should be
considered more carefully.
The same circumstances, shown as Figure 7, are appeared in the series experiments of wind
direction parallel to the ridge of roof. The region of extreme peak pressure of roof are bigger then
the cases of wind normal to the ridge of buildings. In this region the structure design and analysis
should be took carefully.

Figure 7 The distributions of peak surface pressure coefficients on building models with variant
rise-to-span ratio (r) and depth-to-width ratio is 4, in the case of wind direction along to the
roof ridge. (a) r=0.125, (b) r=0.25, (c) r=0.5.
The characteristic modes of surface pressures
The characteristics modes of surface pressures can reveal the main structure of turbulence
effects on buildings. These eigen-modes, which analyzed by POD method, of three frames of
low-rise buildings with rise-to-span ratio r is 0.125 are shown as figure 8. As figure 8(a) shown, in
the cases of wind direction parallel to the roof ridge, the distribution trend of the first three modes
of pressures is quite clear. The distribution type of first mode is symmetric and nearly uniform.
The distribution type of second mode is anti-symmetric, but the third one is symmetric again. As
the wind direction change into normal to the ridge of roof, the symmetric of distribution is
disappear and most of energy are fallen into one side where wind acting.

For the cases of higher rise-to-span ratio, r equal to 0.5, the surface pressure modes on the
first frame of building structure which calculated by POD method are shown as figure 9. The
energy contain of each mode is very non-uniform, and they are shown as table 2 and 3. The first
mode contains more then 90% of total energy and the energy contain is less then 1% for the modes
under fifth mode.
The estimate of Equivalent Static Wind Loadings
In order to calculate the maximum structural response peak factor xg the covariance
integration method is adopted, and with this factor the equivalent static wind loadings (ESWL) can
be estimated according to equation (8). The experiments measured wind pressure timehistory are
adopted as loading data in the calculation procedures, and the target structure is set as a simple
supported arched frame. The schematics and denotation of the analyzed frame structures are
shown in figure 3.

The distribution of wind loads which can result in the maximum structural response are also
be consumed. With the Ginger (2000) proposed covariance integration method and take the
bending moment in frame beam-column joint corner as target, the calculated equivalent static wind
loads are shown in figure 11. In the first step we calculated the peak factor o structural response
( xg ) by equation (7). Secondly, the maximum equivalent static wind loadings can be estimated
according to the equation (8). Two wind directions, normal and parallel to the roof ridge, are
considered.
According to the CM1, the estimated wind loadings on the frames with variant rise-to-span
ratio of building models and the wind direction is parallel to the roof ridge are shown as figure 11.
We can find the estimated wind loadings on the three frames are quite similar with variant
rise-to-span ratios of arched roofs. The first frames are located at the upstream region, so the
estimated wind loadings are the always highest set. And the estimated wind loadings on the third
frame, which located at the downstream region, are the lowest set. These results are quite agreed
with the measured data of aerodynamic experiments. Since the approaching flow may come from
any direction to the buildings, so if we took the estimated wind loadings on the first frame should be
a conservative notion.
The effects of wind direction are also reviewed in this study. Due to the wind loads on the
first frame always the highest set. So we calculated the moment coefficients, CM1 and CM2, on the
first frames of approaching flow with variant angle of attacks to the ridge of roof. As the results
shown in table 5, the large moment coefficients at structural frames are appeared in the cases of
wind direction parallel to the roof ridge or small angle less then 22.5 degree with it. We can find
these coefficients are greater then the values calculated from the 2006 version design code of wind
loads in Taiwan. Especially, the peak pressures distributed on the roof corners are higher then
other regions in small angle of attack of the approaching flow.

Concluding remarks
A series of aerodynamic experiments are conducted on the variant rise-to-span ratios arched
roof low-rise building models with simultaneous pressure measurements technology to get the
model surface pressures data which contained the information of spatial correlation. With the
covariance integration method we can investigate the maximum wind loadings and structural
responses on the target frames. The results of analysis also been compared to the latest
Specification for Building Wind Resistant Design, 2006 version, in Taiwan. Based on above work,
the following results were obtained:
The aerodynamic characteristics of low-rise buildings basically are dominant by arch-vortex,
so the types of surface pressure distributions on the low-rise buildings have lots of similarity. This
feature will be helpful in the creating of prediction model of surface pressures with similar
geometric shapes.
With the experiments results, the peak pressures on the low-rise industrial building roof with
lower rise-to-span ratio will more intense. The connect joints should be enhanced in the
components and cladding wind resistant design at the roof corners and edge of side walls is
necessary. For the arched roof with rise-to-span greater then 0.25, the pressures on the upstream
region of approaching flow will be positive. The main structures of buildings in this situation will
be acted by the positive and negative pressure in the same time with different portions, and may
cause larger structural responses. According to the analysis results of the experiments data in this
study, the arched roof buildings with lower rise-to-span ratio may occur intense peak pressure on
roof corners and the large rise-to-span ratio may increase the structural loadings.
The main consideration of wind acting on the arched roof buildings is normal to the roof
ridge in the latest Specification for Building Wind Resistant Design, 2006 version, in Taiwan.
With the aerodynamic experiments and covariance integration method were adopted in this research,
and we found that the wind along to the roof ridge sometime may cause large structural responses to
the main wind resistant structures. So the combination of loadings cases to reflect the symmetric
and anti-symmetric wind loadings on structures should be suggested in the analysis procedure of
low-rise industrial buildings.
