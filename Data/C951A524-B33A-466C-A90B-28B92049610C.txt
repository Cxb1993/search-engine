Abstract 
This paper presents an experimental modeling of contaminant dispersion in a mock-up 
isolation room with different negative pressure differentials and ventilation rates. A hypothetical 
contaminant (sulfur hexafluoride, SF6) is emitted from a patient lying on a bed in the mock-up 
isolation room. The impacts of ventilation rates 12 h-1 and 24 h-1 and pressure differentials -2.5 Pa, 
-5.0 Pa, -8.0 Pa and -15.0 Pa on the ventilation effectiveness in the room are evaluated 
quantitatively. A local air quality index and an exposure index for healthcare workers are 
introduced in the research to evaluate the ventilation efficiency of the isolation room. Based on 
the results of our experiment, the ventilation efficiency of the isolation room ranks the highest at 
-15.0Pa/24h-1, followed respectively by -15.0Pa/12h-1, -8.0Pa/24h-1, -5.0Pa/24h-1, -2.5Pa/24h-1, 
-8.0Pa/12h-1, -5.0Pa/12h-1, and -2.5Pa/12h-1.

2. Experimental measurements 
2.1 Configuration of the test chamber and measurement locations 
Hypothetical contaminant (SF6) release experiments are performed in a mock-up isolation 
room, a test chamber with the external dimensions of 2.4m (length) x 2.4m (width) x 2.4m 
(height), with a bed as shown in Fig. 1. In the isolation room, the study has a patient lie on a bed 
at the height of 0.55m from the floor. One exhaust air vent (a free opening) with a diameter of 
0.25m is located on the lower wall behind one side of the head of the bed, and one supply air vent 
(a steel plate with 126 0.005m x 0.049m slots) of size 0.2m by 0.4m is installed on the ceiling. 
The ventilation system, located outside the test room, supplies air at the controlled flow rate to 
the room through a ceiling air vent and exhausts room air to the outside through a wall air vent. 
Healthcare workers are at the risk of being exposed to infectious diseases while treating 
infected patients; the dispersion of contaminants in the vicinity of the patient for healthcare 
workers is accordingly investigated. Marked as P1~P10 in Fig. 1 (b), ten measuring points within 
the space close to the patient are selected to monitor the exposure level of the healthcare workers 
at these locations; moreover, two extra measuring points are set up outside the room, one (P11) 
behind an exhaust air vent and another (P12) in front of a supply air vent. The space in which 
healthcare workers are in direct contact with the patient is marked by a blue frame in Fig. 1 (b) 
and takes up about one third of the room.

2.2 Test procedure and data acquisition equipment 
First, the outside air from the supply vent is maintained at a rate of 12 ACH and channeled 
into the mock-up isolation room under pressure differentials of -2.5 Pa, -5.0 Pa, -8.0 Pa and -15.0 
Pa respectively. The room ventilation rate is then increased to 24 ACH to perform experiments as 
same as those in the case of 12 ACH. Based on the same conditions of measurement, the testing 
procedure is repeated three times at different days. In the experiments, a pre-calibrated air capture 
hood (ALNOR, APM150) with accuracy of ± (3% of reading + 11.9 m3/h) and ± (4% of reading 
4 
and -15.0 Pa. Points P1-P3 and P4-P6 are situated respectively at a height of 1.75m and 0.79m 
from the floor above the bed-lying patient. Points P7-P9 are placed at a height of 0.46 m from the 
floor, slightly lower than the bed and exhaust vent. Point P10 is set at a height of 1.57 m from the 
floor, approximately the height of the breathing zone for healthcare workers.  
In order to promote the accuracy of the measurement data, our study adopts the mean values 
of the contaminant concentration based on the three-day measurements and their uncertainties. 
First, as revealed in Fig. 3(a), the concentration of contaminants at the 10 measuring points 
(P1-P10) within the room is examined. In the case of -2.5 Pa, point P3 reports the lowest 
concentration of contaminant because this is the farthest location from the source of contaminants. 
Points P5 and P8 are positioned under the ceiling supply vent; hence, their concentration is the 
lowest among points P4-P6 and P7-P9 respectively. On the contrary, point P2, while also located 
under the ceiling supply vent, shows a concentration that is not the lowest among points P1-P3 
since it is placed fairly far from the wall exhaust vent. The highest concentration of contaminant 
is found at either point P4 or point P6 since the two measuring points stands are placed at a height 
closer to that of the contaminant source. Moreover, it should be noted that the concentration of 
contaminants at point P4 is probably not significantly different from that at point P6, as the 
means and their error regions overlap. The concentration profile of contaminants in the cases of 
-5.0, -8.0 and -15.0 Pa is similar to the one in the case of -2.5 Pa; however, higher room pressure 
differentials result in lower concentration levels of contaminants.

ventilation rates (a) 12 ACH and (b) 24 ACH at room pressure differentials -2.5 Pa, -5.0 Pa, -8.0

In order to establish negative pressure in the isolation room, more room air should be 
extracted from the isolation room than supplied into it; therefore, additional clean air should be 
allowed to infiltrate into the isolation room via door gaps. Greater difference in negative pressure 
results in more clean air flowing into the isolation room via the door gaps when the supplied air 
from the ceiling vent stays at a constant air rate. The effect of changes in room pressure 
differentials on the concentration of contaminants at the 10 measuring points is also examined.

3.3 Exposure index for healthcare workers 
The need to access an infected patient to perform medical treatments exposes healthcare 
workers to a dangerous environment marked with a high concentration level of infectious 
contaminants. The infectious airborne contaminants exhaled from a patient disperse to the 
healthcare workers along with the air movement in an isolation room, and the concentration of 
contaminants decreases as distance from the patient grows greater. A normalized exposure index 
is used to express the exposure risk of airborne contaminants to healthcare workers [15, 16]. A 
lower index indicates a greater difficulty in the dilution of contaminants and a higher exposure of 
infection to the healthcare workers beside the patient. The exposure index for healthcare workers, 
EI, is defined as: 
sb
se
CC
CCEI −
−=  (2) 
Where Ce and Cs are concentrations of exhaust and supply airborne contaminants, respectively. 
Cb is the average concentration of airborne contaminants inhaled by healthcare workers. The 
concentration of inhaled contaminant (personal exposure) usually comes from the combined 
source of the air close to the mouth and the air from the convective ascending air current along 
the body, depending on the person's movements. The study, however, does not take into account 
of the effects of the person’s movement. 
As revealed in Fig. 5, the ventilation system at lower room pressure differentials reports a 
lower EI, suggesting a higher EI to the healthcare workers beside the patient. The EI in the case 
of 12 ACH at pressure differentials of -5.0 Pa, -8.0 Pa and -15.0 Pa reads respectively 102%, 
119% and 170% to the one at the pressure differential of -2.5 Pa, while the EI in the case of 24 
ACH at pressure differentials of -5.0 Pa, -8.0 Pa and -15.0 Pa is respectively 101%, 119% and 
155% to the one at the pressure differential of -2.5 Pa. The current study reveals that a two-fold 
increase in the room pressure differential from -2.5 Pa to -5.0 Pa produces no significant impact 
on the increase in EI, while increasing -2.5 Pa pressure differential by six times generates a 
greater benefit of a 55% (Case 24 ACH) and 70% (Case 12 ACH) increase in EI. However, high 
room pressure differentials help increase EI since more clean air via door gaps than from the 
supply vent is allowed to flow into the room to raise the ventilation rate. Moreover, increasing the 
ventilation rate is more beneficial in the increase in EI and ventilation efficiency of an isolation 
room than increasing the room pressure differentials. Figure 5 further indicates that doubling the 
flow rate of supply air leads to a 27% increase in EI at room pressure differentials -2.5 Pa, -5.0 Pa 
and -8.0 Pa, and a 16% increase in EI at the pressure differential of -15.0 Pa. If the EI in Case 
-2.5Pa/12ACH is one, the EI in Cases -5.0Pa/12ACH, -8.0Pa/12ACH, -15.0Pa/12ACH, 
-2.5Pa/24ACH, -5.0Pa/24ACH, -8.0Pa/24ACH and -15.0Pa/24ACH can be expressed 
respectively as 1.02, 1.19, 1.70, 1.27, 1.28, 1.50 and 1.97. The best and the worst choices among 
the two ventilation rates and the four pressure differentials studied would be the cases of -15.0 Pa 
pressure differential at 24 ACH ventilation rate (EI = 6.07±1.84) and -2.5 Pa pressure differential

二、與會心得 
I appreciate the financial supports from NSC to attend the 2008 ASHRAE Winter Meeting and 
present a paper entitled “A Novel Air Distribution System and Energy Saving Strategies for 
Cleanrooms with High Heat-Load and High Fine-Particle Sources.” There were 24 forums and 15 
transactions sessions and 91 seminars at the meeting; besides, a poster session was held on Jan 22, 
2008. Some typical topics are addressed as follows: 
1. High Density Cooling Issues Update—January 2008 
This session addresses cooling of high density electronic equipment installations such as data 
centers, telecommunication facilities, and combinations thereof. Power densities of 1000 watts 
per square meter (93 watts per square foot) or higher are increasingly commonplace. Issues of 
recent concern are provision, distribution and control of adequate airflow, the return to liquid 
cooling, reliability, and best practices. 
2. Building Information Modeling (BIM) 
Building information modeling (BIM) is changing the way buildings are designed, constructed, 
operated and maintained. This seminar pro-vides an in-depth overview of the definition of BIM 
and explores ASHRAE’s role in contributing to the development of national and international 
BIM standards and guidelines. It also provides a discussion of the current status of the 
development of automated code checking software and systems for BIM designs and provides 
information on case studies of some current projects where the BIM process is being applied. 
3. Factory Testing, Commissioning and Maintainability of Tunnel Fans 
Most road and rapid transit tunnels include forced ventilation for either contaminant control or 
 risk of moisture penetration and mold growth in walls with stucco cladding are described. The 
rationale behind ASHRAE Standard 160P, Criteria for Moisture Control Design Analysis in 
Buildings, its current outline, and its potential uses are summarized. Standard 160P sets criteria 
for moisture design loads, moisture analysis methods, and building performance, and applies to 
the above-grade portions of all types of buildings.  
9. Applying UVGI Without Getting Burned: Taking Precautions And Overcoming Barriers  
The application of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems is becoming common for 
improving indoor air quality, controlling air-borne disease transmission, and as a bioterrorism 
countermeasure. However, many people continue to have questions regarding human and 
HVAC component exposures to UVC. Those interested in applying UV technologies need to 
understand the biological effects of human exposure to UVC, the potential for HVAC 
component degradation, how to plan and install systems to limit exposures, and how to safely 
and properly maintain these systems. This seminar focuses on these aspects with practical 
knowledge gained from experience in the field.  
10. Designing and Realization of Energy Efficient, Sustainable and Green Buildings to Stop Global 
Warming, Part 1  
ASHRAE’s Associate Societies meet at each winter meeting and organize seminars presenting 
international efforts and results of engineering projects concerning energy efficiency in 
buildings and HVAC systems. This seminar presents solutions and descriptions on of such 
buildings in Europe and Asia, their performance, analysis of their energy needs, methods used in 
designing and construction. The goal is to present what was done in the practice in reaching 
healthy buildings, buildings with reduced use of non-renewable and increased use of renewable 
energy, and getting green and sustainable buildings.  
11. Indoor Air Chemistry, IAQ and Health  
Ozone originating in outdoor air reacts with common indoor chemicals to produce more toxic 
and irritating compounds than those from which they are formed. Outdoor ozone levels far 
below regulatory limits are associated with significant increases in premature death. Available 
evidence suggests an association between outdoor ozone concentrations and increased morbidity 
including building-related symptoms in office buildings. Finally, elevated outdoor ozone and 
polyester building filters result in greatly increased building related symptom rates. This 
seminar focuses on these problems and the implications for ASHRAE and for building design 
professionals who must specify ventilation rates, filtration and air cleaning.  
12. Standard 62.1 Multiple Spaces Issues  
This seminar reports on a recent research project (RP 1276) that experimentally validated the 
“Multiple Spaces Equation” in ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2004: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor 
Air Quality. This same research project also included field measurements of Er, a variable in the 
generalized multiple spaces equation (Appendix A in Standard 62.1) used to take credit for local 
recirculation such as that provided by fan-powered VAV boxes. This seminar also includes a 
session on how the generalized multiple spaces equation can be applied to real applications to 
improve ventilation efficiency.
