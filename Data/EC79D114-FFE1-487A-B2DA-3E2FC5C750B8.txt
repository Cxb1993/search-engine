Abstract 
A GeSn film with composition Ge0.98Sn0.02 and 272 nm thickness was grown on n-type silicon at 
350 oC using ultrahigh-vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHVCVD). This material was 
subsequently annealed at 75 oC 0 using RTA and then used to fabricate a prototype PN and MOS 
structure photodetector with Pt gate electrodes. In addition, the PN with mesa structure is also 
fabricated. At -2 V, the measured responsivity of mesa structure of GeSn photodetector at 1.3μm 
wavelength is 9.51 mA/W. Due to smaller bandgap of GeSn, the cutoff wavelength of GeSn 
photodetector can be extended to 1930 nm, which is much longer than the cutoff wavelength of Ge 
photodetector, 1850 nm. 
Infrared emission from Ge n+p device is observed with photoluminescence (PL) and 
electroluminescence (EL) measurement. The high PL/EL pumping level, n-type doping 
concentration, and high temperature, and biaxial tensile strain can enhance the direct band gap 
transition. The spectra of indirect and direct band gap emission can be analyzed by using the 
electron-hole-plasma (EHP) recombination model and the direct band gap recombination model, 
respectively. The progressive improvement of the radiative recombination makes it possible to have 
Ge-based light emitting devices for practical applications.  
Effect of oxide surface roughness scattering and material defects on radiative emission in Ge was 
also studied. The indirect emission lower than direct emission in Ge on Si structure reveals that 
material defects would cause more serious degradation in indirect transition than direct transition. 
 
Keywords: GeSn, Ge, Ge-on-Si, photodetector, PL, EL, strain, surface roughness scattering,

一、前言與研究目的 
Integrating Si photonics have become a promising technology which will be embedded in 
commercial electronics for system-to-system data communication in the coming future. The optical 
interconnection has the advantage of high speed operation, power saving and decreasing the thermal 
penalty on chips. An aggressive expansion of Si photonics research has been seen in the past few 
years. Mario Paniccia’s team from Intel Corporation demonstrated the super high speed data rate 
operation (50 Gbit s-1) on the system of low-cost highly integrated silicon based optical 
interconnects[1]. John E. Bower[2] and Jifeng Liu[3] developed Si-hybrid laser and Ge-on-Si laser, 
respectivily. Nano-scale Si waveguide with surface plasma techique[4] was applied to shrink the 
scale of optical componenets. All of the research reults show great potential of Si/Ge photonic 
technology in the wild applucition such as CPU-memory connection, PC-protable devices connection, 
high definition display, and the clould internet. 
Mateiral quality of the integration of SiGe process is the most critical requirement for develpoing 
the CMOS-compatible Si photonics. Ge is expected to be the best candidate material for the active 
layer in Si based optical devices becasue of its high carrier mobility, strong photon absorption, 
pseudo-direct band gap and the last but the most, ability to integrated into Si CMOS process. 
However, the nature of indirect band gap of Ge causes its internal light efficiency very sensitive to 
lattice defects and dislocations. It makes the research of high quality Ge growth on Si substrate even 
more important. Recently, several studies focused on developing high quality Ge on Si[5-6], hoping 
to provide better material quality for Si based optical devices. The method to enhance the direct 
badndap transition in Ge by the strain engineering such as mechnaical stress and mateiral thermal 
expention mismatch can further boost the light efficiency of Ge. This is also the only reported 
method which can achieve the lasing emission in Ge. 
GeSn has a lower band gap than Ge. Therefore, GeSn is attractive for detector and photovoltaic 
applications at longer wavelength detection than Ge. GeSn layers have ideal properties as templates 
for the subsequent deposition of other semiconductors : (a) low threading defect densities (105 cm-2); 
(b) low growth temperatures and high thermal stability (up to 750°C depending on composition); (c) 
tunable lattice constants; (d) flat surfaces provide an ideal platform for subsequent growth; (e) 
selective grow ability (using SiO2 mask). 
Silicon have played the main part in CMOS industry for these few decades. However, for the 
future of electronic and photonic integration circuits (EPICs), germanium would become more and 
more important for its outstanding optical properties and abitliy to integrate to silicon. We hold a 
great expectation on Ge in the application of photonics. In the past three years, we focused our 
research on the high efficient Ge and SiGe opitcal devices, using the conventional CMOS process to 
fabricate devices, and aggressively expending light efficiency by GeSn material and strain 
engineering.

II. Enhancement of direct band radiative recombination from Ge 
Due to the high carrier mobility, strong photon absorption, and possible integration with Si, the 
indirect band gap Ge is used for both scientific interest and optoelectronic applications. The methods 
to enhance the direct bandgap transition include the high pumping level, the elevated temperature, 
the high concentration of n type doping, and the biaxial tensile strain. Significant enhancement of 
direct transition fraction in both photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) is 
demonstrated. The physical recombination models are developed for both direct and indirect 
transitions. 
The electrons in Γ valley and L valley recombine with holes in the valence band and emit 
infrared at the 795meV peak (direct bandgap transition) and the 695meV peak (indirect bandgap 
transition), respectively. By increasing pumping power, the electron fraction in Γ valley increases 
and the electron Fermi level moves upwards. The direct bandgap transition becomes relatively strong 
at high power excitation, although the electron density in Γ valley is much smaller as compared to 
L valleys. The PL and EL infrared emission from the n+p Ge structure are observed at room 
temperature and elevated temperature.  
Fig. 9 shows the EL spectrum of indirect and direct bandgap emission from Ge p+n diode. 
Spectrum can be well fitted by using the electron-hole-plasma (EHP) recombination model and the 
direct bandgap recombination model, respectively. To have a reasonable fit, the band tail of 
absorption edge in the direct bandgap recombination model is taken into consideration. The intensity 
fraction of direct bandgap transition increases with increasing excitation level and reaches 39% and 
22% at EL excitation of 600mA and PL excitation of 360mW, respectively. The intensity fractions of 
direct bandgap transition are enhanced by 4 times and 1.1 times for EL excitation from 100mA to 
600mA and PL excitation from 120mW to 360mW, respectively.

The electron population effect on the competition between direct and indirect transitions can be 
also observed by controlling the doping condition in substrate. As shown in Fig. 13, the bulk (100) 
Ge with low resistivity (0.005~0.02 Ω-cm) shows more significant direct band transition as 
compared to the Ge with high resistivity (1~10 Ω-cm). The Ge with higher electron concentration 
moves the electron Fermi energy closer to the conduction band edge under the same pumping power. 
Due to the Fermi-Dirac distribution, the upshift of electron Fermi level increases the relative electron 
concentration at the Γ valley with respect to L valleys. Therefore, low-resistivity Ge has stronger 
direct transition than high-resistivity Ge.

ΔEcΓ and ΔEcL indicate that EcΓ and EcL drop in energy. The direct and indirect gap reductions are 
extracted using the direct band gap recombination model and electron-hole plasma recombination 
model, respectively. The deformation potential and 6×6 k.p methods are used to calculate the 
conduction band edges and valence band edges, respectively.  
The positive value of ΔEcΓ−ΔEcL indicates that the energy difference between the Γ valley and L 
valleys decreases under biaxial tensile strain. The movement of Γ valley toward L valleys increases 
electron transfer into the Γ valley, and enhances the direct transitions for (100) and (110) Ge. Note 
that the positive increase in ΔEcΓ−ΔEcL of (110) Ge is smaller than that of (100) Ge. In other words, 
the energy difference between the Γ valley and the lowest L valleys is larger on (110) Ge than on 
(100) Ge under the same biaxial tensile strain. On the contrary, for (111) Ge, the negative value of 
ΔEcΓ−ΔEcL indicates that the energy difference between the Γ valley and the lowest L valleys 
increases with biaxial tensile strain. However, the direct transition is still enhanced for (111) Ge with 
biaxial tensile strain. The enhancement is contributed from the shrinkage of EcΓ−Efn (i.e., ΔEcΓ＞
ΔEfn), where Efn is the electron Fermi level. Fig. 19 shows the schematic diagrams of band structures 
of Ge without strain (solid line) and with biaxial tensile strain (dashed line). (a) The band gap 
reduction in L valleys and Γ valley on (100) Ge. (b) The band gap reduction in split L valleys and Γ 
valley on (110) Ge. (c) The band gap reductions in split L valleys and Γ valley on (111) Ge. 
In summary, we presented the PL and EL spectra from the direct and indirect bandgap transition. 
The high PL/EL pumping level, n-type doping concentration, and high temperature can enhance the 
direct bandgap transition. The strain can be an extra factor to enhance the direct transition of Ge. The 
enhanced PL of (100) and (110) Ge is caused by the reduction in the energy difference between the 
EcΓ and EcL,low under biaxial tensile strain. On the other hand, the small DOS of low valleys result in 
the reduction in the energy difference between the EcΓ and Efn, which is responsible to the enhanced 
PL on (111) Ge. The progressive improvement of the radiative recombination makes it possible to 
have Ge-based light emitting devices with better efficiency (Fig. 19).

°C in H2–GeH4 mixed ambient. The 550 °C growth temperature is used for accelerating the growth 
rate of Ge film. In order to improve crystallinity of the Ge layer, several cycles of annealing steps 
were introduced during the Ge layer deposition process by interrupting the Ge layer growth.[11] The 
thickness of the relaxed Ge layer is ~2.8 μm with estimated threading dislocation density (TDD) of 
~3.7 x106 cm-2 observed by optical microscope after Secco etching (Fig. 21). 
The PL spectrum of Ge on Si has also been measured in Fig. 22. The PL intensity of Ge on Si 
sample is weaker than bulk Ge sample, probably due to the larger TDD in Ge on Si sample. However, 
the PL intensity ratio of direct and indirect transition increase from 0.19 (bulk Ge) to 3 (Ge on Si). The 
larger defect density in Ge on Si sample may lead to a broad range trap level and probably increase the 
non-radiative transition, as shown in Fig. 22. The indirect transition thus becomes weaker, and the 
intensity ratio increase. The integrated PL intensity of bulk Ge is ~23 times of that of Ge on Si, 
indicating more defects in Ge on Si sample to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination within 
forbidden gap, inducing a high non-radiative recombination rate. 
For indirect radiative recombination in bulk Ge, a dominant LA phonon (~28 meV) is involved to 
satisfy the momentum conservation between L valleys in conduction band and the zone center in 
valance band. However, in Ge on Si sample, the large defect density in Ge film may lead to a trap 
level in momentum space. This trap level enhances non-radiative recombination rate because the 
more phonons with different momentum can be involved in the momentum conservation (Fig. 23). 
Thus, the relative intensity of indirect band gap transition is lower in Ge on Si sample than in bulk 
Ge. 
In summary, direct band gap radiative transition can be enhanced by the n+p junction structure as 
compared with MIS structure. Indirect radiative transition can be enhanced by roughness scattering 
but be degraded with increasing defect density.

temperature. Oxide roughness scattering conserve the momentum and increase the 
indirect radiative transition.

The high PL, EL pumping level and high temperature can enhance the direct bandgap transition. The 
strain can be an extra factor to enhance the direct transition of Ge. From our PL data, the 
enhancement can be up to ~1.8 times under 0.37% strain. The progressive improvement of the 
radiative recombination makes it possible to have Ge-based light emitting devices with better 
efficiency. Threading dislocations and surface roughness scattering has significant effect on indirect 
transition in Ge, which are the main factors to alter the light efficiency of Ge-on-Si material 
structure.

二、與會心得 
 
    本人有幸參與此次於在拉斯維加斯舉行之第218屆電化學會議 Electron 
Chemistries Sociality (ECS) Meeting。 本會議包含了材料科學、能源科技、
半導體物理、矽鍺光學及電子電機領域之論文，藉由參加此會議可廣泛吸收到
與本人研究領域相關之知識，而且經由會議中以英文對話之相互討論，更可增
進聽與說方面之英文能力。在為期五天的議程中，除了本身發表之論文( " 
Photoluminescence characterization and passivation of CIGS absorber " 及 " 
Enhancements of direct band radiative recombination from Ge " )，亦參與了多場相關
領域之論文發表會，可了解到現今最先進之矽鍺光電、電子元件、製程技術及
各國研究概況，並對未來將會面臨之研發問題及所須突破之關鍵技術有了更深
刻的了解。而在綠能的研究領域方面亦參加多場論文發表會，例如太陽能電池
效率之提升及先進的應用觀念等相關論文，在綠能科技技術與應用越來越重要
的現代社會裡，高效率、低成本的製程技術及材料應用發展是全世界研究趨勢
的方向。 
 
    在矽鍺光學的相關論文發表部分，整合奈米光電元件及高資料處理的光電
積體電路，已成為高頻寬、能量效率及低電池干擾的發展趨勢，其可達到高效
率的資料傳輸，但其目前最主要的發展限制在於可整合於矽製程之大型光電積
體電路的電激發光光源。在考量矽製成的大型積體電路，鍺具有高度的相容性，
且其雖為非直接能隙，但其與直接能隙的能量差異並不大，可藉由n型高摻雜濃
度及外加應力等方式，使載子於直接能隙的分佈增加，提高直接能隙的躍遷。
