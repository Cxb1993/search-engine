Abstract: This project proposes a new adaptive feedforward cancellation (AFC) control that achieves periodic
tracking and/or periodic disturbance rejection. The new control design is a direct scheme in the sense that it
adaptively updates the desired control without estimating the unknown disturbance. The proposed new control
has several advantages. First, its adaptation gain can be arbitrarily chosen without upsetting the system stability.
Second, it can be applied to not only minimum-phase systems, but also non-minimum phase systems. Finally, it is
shown that the desired AFC control is independent of where the disturbance enters the system.

1 Introduction
In many industrial applications, the control system
is required to track or reject periodic exogenous signals
(desired reference output or disturbance). Examples in-
clude periodic motion of robot manipulators [1], repeat-
able runout in disk drive [2], torque ripples in harmonic
drives [3], periodic force disturbance in metal cutting,
and so on. The control that can successfully drive the
system to track or reject periodic signals is called the
repetitive control. Survey papers on repetitive control
designs can be found in [4] and [5].
In the literature, the first approach for repetitive con-
trol design is proposed in [6], which is based on the
internal modelling principle [7]. In this work, a time
delay internal model is placed inside the nominal sta-
ble feedback loop to guarantee asymptotic tracking or
disturbance rejection of the periodic signal. The ad-
vantages of this approach are that convergence is vary
rapid and that the controller is linear, making analysis
easy. However, the internal model introduces an infinite
number of open-loop poles on the stability boundary;
making stabilization of the overall system difficult. As a
result, one must sacrifice the system performance at the
high frequency harmonics in order to ensure closed-loop
stability [8] [9]. Another disadvantage of this approach
is that robustness to noise and unmodelled dynamics is
impaired by the time delay internal model [4].
The second approach for repetitive control design is
the basis function approach or often called the adaptive
feedforward cancellation (AFC) approach. With this
approach, the periodic exogenous signal is modelled as
a linear combination of finite or infinite basis functions
with unknown coefficients. An adaptive algorithm is
proposed to estimate these unknown coefficients, and
a feedforward control that cancels the disturbance ef-
forts is then constructed [10]. However, stability of the
adaptive system is ensured only if the system is SPR
(strictly positive real). When the system is not SPR,
the adaptation gain must be constrained to be small in
order to maintain stability. The equivalence between the
AFC in [10] and the internal model based approach is
established in [11]. A modified adaptive algorithm with
an extra phase advance is proposed in [12] to expedite
the algorithm’s convergence. However, the adaptation
gain is still constrained by the stability requirement. In
[3] and [4], a different adaptive algorithm is proposed,
whose adaptation gain can be arbitrarily chosen without
disturbing the system stability. However, their adaptive
algorithms are based on inversion of the system transfer
function; hence, they can be applied to minimum-phase
systems only (systems with stable zeros). When the
system is non-minimum phase, an approximation algo-
rithm based on the zero-phase-error-tracking design may
be used [4].
This project proposes a new AFC approach for the
repetitive controller design. The proposed new design is

Different adaptive algorithms may be used in this ap-
proach, but in this paper the gradient algorithm [14] is
chosen for its compactness and less computational load.
A brief review of the gradient algorithm will be given
here. The gradient algorithm is usually used in situa-
tions where one wishes to estimate an unknown constant
vector θ ∈ Rp, which characterizes either a signal or a
dynamic system. The first step of the estimation process
is to obtain, through a re-parameterization procedure,
a linear regression form in θ,
w(t) = φT (t)θ, (8)
where w(t) ∈ R is an available signal, φ(t) ∈ Rp is a
known bounded regressor, and θ ∈ Rp is the unknown
constant vector to be estimated. Let θˆ(t) be an estimate
of θ. Based on the above linear regression form, the
gradient algorithm suggests the following update law for
θˆ(t),
˙ˆ
θ(t) = γφ(t)(w(t)− φT (t)θˆ(t)) (9)
with a positive adaptation gain γ > 0, and an arbitrary
initial guess θˆ(0). Note that the regressor φ(t) in the lin-
ear regression form (8) needs to be uniformly bounded
for the gradient algorithm (9). If one denotes the esti-
mation error θ˜(t) = θ − θˆ(t), the update law (9) results
in a linear error dynamics
˙˜
θ(t) = −γ φ(t)φT (t)θ˜(t). (10)
Lemma 1 [14] : If the regressor vector φ(t) is persis-
tently exciting in the sense that for some finite interval
length ∆, the following matrix is positive definite for all
t > 0, ∫ t+∆
t
φ(τ)φT (τ)dτ > 0,
then the error dynamics (10) is exponentially stable, and
θˆ(t) in (9) converges to θ exponentially.
3 Adaptive Feedforward Cancel-
lation Control Design
The goal of this section is to find an ideal control
that achieves asymptotic tracking of the periodic refer-
ence ym(t) regardless of the periodic disturbance d(t).
To start with the control design, first re-arrange (3) into
y(t)−W2(s)[d(t)] =W1(s)[u(t)]. (11)
It is important to note that if um(t) is the ideal control
that achieves tracking of ym(t) in the face of disturbance
d(t), it must satisfy
ym(t)−W2(s)[d(t)] =W1(s)[um(t)]. (12)
To prove the existence of such um(t), one needs the fol-
lowing assumption.
Assumption A2. W1(jkω0) 6= 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , N
where ω0 = 2pi/T , T is the period of d(t) and ym(t),
and W1(s) is as given in (2).
Remark 2 : Assumption A2 requires that the transfer
function W1(s) has no system zero at s = jkω0. This
assumption is both sufficient and necessary to achieve
the goal of repetitive control. The reason is as follows.
If W1(s) has a system zero at s = jkω0, due to the zero
gain of W1(s) at s = jkω0, the control um in (12) can
not generate the k’th harmonics sin(kω0t) at the output
point of W1(s), which is necessary to track/reject the
k’th harmonics in ym(t)/d(t). This assumption can be
waived only if the disturbance enters the system at the
input point (W1(s) = W2(s)), and there is no tracking
mission (ym(t) = 0). However, as long as there is a pe-
riodic tracking mission (ym(t) 6= 0), or the disturbance
enters the system ”not” at the input point, Assumption
A2, which has been neglected by most previous litera-
ture, is necessary.
Lemma 2 : Given stable transfer function W1(s) and
W2(s), and periodic reference ym(t) in (7) and periodic
disturbance d(t) in (4), if Assumption A2 holds, there
exists a periodic um(t) ,
um(t) = φT (t)θu, (13)
satisfying Equation (12), with φ(t) ∈ R2N+1 as in (5),
and θu ∈ R2N+1 some constant vector.
Proof: See Appendix I.
After identifying the existence of the ideal control
um(t), the control design problem becomes the problem
of estimating um(t). According to (13) in Lemma 2, esti-
mation of the periodic control um(t) is futher reduced to
estimation of the unknown constant vector θu in (13).
In order to estimate θu, one needs a linear regression
form in θu. This can be obtained by substituting (13)
into (12),
ym(t)−W2(s)[d(t)] =W1(s)[φT (t)θu] = ψT1 (t)θu, where ψ1(t) =W1(s)[φ(t)], (14)
where the regressor ψ1(t) in the above linear regression
form is bounded since φ(t) as defined in (5) is bounded
and W1(s) is a stable system. Unfortunately, on the left
hand side of the above equation, the signal W2(s)[d(t)]

words, no matter where the disturbance comes into the
system, the proposed control remains the same. This is
shown for the first time in the literature, and it justi-
fies previous AFC designs in which the disturbances are
mostly assumed to enter the system at the control input
point, even though in reality it is not the case.
4 Adaptive Disturbance Estima-
tion
Many previous AFC controls are indirect adaptive
control since they first estimate the unknown distur-
bance, and then design the AFC control based on the
disturbance estimate. In contrast, the proposed AFC
control in the previous section is a direct scheme since it
estimates the desired control directly without estimat-
ing the disturbance. In some applications, it may be
desirable to monitor and track the time history of the
unknown disturbance d(t). Hence, in this section an
adaptive algorithm will be presented for estimation of
the unknown periodic disturbance d(t).
To estimate the disturbance is equivalent to estimate
the constant vector θd in (4). To this end, one needs a
linear regression form in θd. This can be obtained by
substituting (4) into (11),
y(t)−W1(s)[u(t)] =W2(s)[φT (t)θd] = ψT2 (t)θd, where ψ2(t) =W2(s)[φ(t)]. (19)
Based on the above linear regression form, the gradient
algorithm in (9) suggests the following update law for
the estimated θˆd(t)
˙ˆ
θd(t) = γ ψ2(t)(y(t)−W1(s)[u(t)]− ψT2 (t)θˆd(t)), (20)
where γ > 0 is the adaptation gain. To show that ψ2(t)
as defined in (19) is persistently exciting, one needs an-
other assumption.
Assumption A3. W2(jkω0) 6= 0 for k = 0, 1, . . . , N
where ω0 = 2pi/T , T is the period of d(t), and W2(s) is
as given in (2).
The proof of the following theorem is omitted since it
is the same as the proof of Lemma 3.
Theorem 2 : Under Assumptions A1, and A3, ψ2(t)
as defined in (19) is persistently exciting. Further, θˆd(t)
in (20) converges to θd exponentially, and hence the fol-
lowing disturbance estimate
dˆ(t) = φT (t)θˆd(t),
converges to the true disturbance d(t) = φT (t)θd expo-
nentially.
5 Conclusions
This project presents a new adaptive feedforward
cancellation control for linear systems to track periodic
reference outputs and/or reject periodic disturbances.
The proposed new control is a direct scheme since it
adaptively updates the desired control without estimat-
ing the unknown disturbance. The new control has sev-
eral advantages compared with previous designs. First,
its adaptation gain can be arbitrarily chosen without
disturbing the system stability. Second, it can be ap-
plied to non-minimum phase systems without using any
approximation. Finally, it is shown that the proposed
control remains the same no matter where the distur-
bance comes into the system.
Since the adaptation gain can be arbitrarily chosen
without destroying the system stability, it will be in-
teresting to apply the technique used in [12] to search
for the optimal value of the adaptation gain that max-
imizes the system’s convergence speed. Another future
work is to develop similar control designs for discrete-
time linear systems, even though this paper is presented
for continuous-time linear systems. It is also interesting
to note the development of iterative or adaptive learning
control [16] [17]. The learning control problem is closely
related to the repetitive control problem studied in this
paper.
