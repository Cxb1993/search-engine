Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films, 
Hydrofluoroether (HFE), and sub-micro- 
structures surface of DLC film are coated 
onto D263T glass which was used as the 
substrate. Purposing this work is to deposit 
hydrogen-free DLC films on substrates at 
various process parameters to tune the 
properties of the DLC films. The 
corresponding microstructure, optical 
performance, and mechanical properties of 
DLC films were identified by scanning 
electron microscope (SEM), X-ray 
photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), NIP, 
Raman spectroscopy, Atomic force 
microscopy (AFM), UV/vis spectrometer, 
contact angle goniometry, and fractal 
analysis measurements, respectively. From 
SEM results, the plan view surface of DLC 
films are smooth morphology and those 
films do not affect the cark on the surfaces, 
owing to as-deposited DLC films easily 
form the high internal stresses. AFM 
surface topography for DLC/D263T glass 
indicates that the average rms roughness is 
1.86 nm below with scanning area of 30×30 
μm2. The NIP test results show that the 
hardness behaviors of all as-deposited 
single layer DLC films onto D263T glass 
are ranging from 13.2 to 22.5 GPa, and its 
hardness is larger than that of the 
non-coated of 6.86 GPa. Also, it is found 
that the water contact angle of single layer 
DLC films on coated D263T glass are 
improved significantly with an increase of 
145% via DI water droplets. The 
aforementioned hardness and wetting test 
results showed that the hardness and 
hydrophobic behaviors of all as-deposited 
DLC films improved significantly with the 
increase of the sp3 content. The water and 
oil contact angles of the HFE/Sub- 
micro-structures surface of DLC films are 
above 137o and 101o, respectively. 
However, the low transmittance shows the 
etching time of carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) 
plasma treatment increased accordingly. 
Above results confirm that sputtering 
process parameters are an important factor 
in the nanotribological characteristics and 
fractal analysis of DLC films deposited on 
D263T glass substrate. The investigations 
reported here show the importance of 
deposition power and deposition time in 
tuning the properties of the DLC films. 
These results suggest useful information for 
the development of modern applications of 
optoelectronic devices.

1. Introduction 
Recently, research has indicated that it is 
possible to prepare DLC films that have 
excellent mechanical and optical 
properties[1-3]. Diamond-like carbon (DLC) 
containing a large proportion of combined 
sp3/sp2-hybrid bonds has extreme properties 
similar to diamond[4-9]. Hydrogen-free DLC 
films with the highest density and sp3 content 
belongs to tetrahedral amorphous carbons 
that possess far more superior electron field 
emission properties than the diamond films 
of sp3 bonds[10,11]. The DLC phase is a 
potential candidate for protective and 
optoelectronic materials owing to its 
advantageous properties such as excellent 
mechanical hardness, heat conduction, wear 
resistance, high electrical resistance, 
chemical inertness, low friction coefficient, 
high transmittance of infrared (IR) and 
ultraviolet (UV) light-cut filter, and optical 
transparency in the infrared region[12-16]. 
The most important aspect of a high 
transmission with reduced reflectance is that 
it has the capability to maintain enough 
visibility in the potential field for 
antireflection coatings, which is a type of 
optical coating applied to the surface of 
lenses and other optical devices to reduce 
reflection. Thus, this kind of optical coating 
improves the efficiency of the system since 
less light is lost[17,18]. On the other hand, 
other research that DLC have developed for 
moisture resistant lubricant and water 
repellant in optical thin-film owing to it’s the 
finer surface and lower 
adsorbability[19].Moreover, one further 
aspect of DLC films performance is also of 
very importance, indicating that the films 
offer to resist for environmental attack, such 
as temperature and atmospheric moisture[20]. 
In this study, DLC films were coated onto 
4 
for the DLC films deposited onto D263T 
glass substrates at room temperature and the 
various process parameters. The Raman 
scattering spectra show a typically 
characteristic Raman feature of DLC 
bonding in all as-deposited DLC films. 
Figure 1 shows two bands with the 
wavelength range of 1000 to 2000 cm-1. The 
Raman peak located at approximately 1350 
cm-1 indicates that the DLC films are 
attributed to micro-crystalline with 
disordered sp3 sites graphite, labeled graphite 
(D)-band for the DLC films. The D band 
peaks shifted from 1392 to 1401 cm-1 as the 
rf power increased from 150 to 175 W, and 
then shifted to left wave numbers over 1350 
cm-1, indicating that sp3 bonds had more than 
sp2 bonds with an increase in the D-peak 
wavenumber, as shown Figure 1(b)[23,24]. 
One band located at approximately 1580 cm-1 
showed that the DLC films contain 
crystalline graphite, labeled graphite 
(G)-band for the DLC films. The G band 
peaks slightly shifted to 1574 cm-1 as the rf 
power of 150 W and deposition time of 0.5 h 
(specimen GD 1), and then shifted to lower 
wave numbers below 1580 cm-1 as sp3 carbon 
domains increase, as shown Figure 1(c). The 
tetrahedral bonds have been broken and 
transformed to trigonal bonds with a slightly 
increased graphitic composition in the DLC 
films owing to the increased local heat 
induced by a higher sputter power and a 
longer deposition time[25].

deposited on D263T glass at room 
temperature under rf powers of 150 and 175 
W, which were calculated by two Gaussian 
fitting peaks. (a) Raman spectra of DLC 
films were with wave numbers are in the 
range from 1000 to 2000 cm-1, and (b) 
Raman shifts of D peaks and (c) G peaks. 
 
3.2 XPS analysis of DLC films 
XPS is employed to obtain quantitative 
results of film composition (sp2: sp3), which 
is chemically specific as each element has its 
own core level. Figures 2(a)-(f) indicate the 
deconvolution of C 1s peak of DLC film 
deposited with an XPS curve fitted using the 
three- curve methods. Figure 2(g) shows a 
wide XPS spectrum of the specimen GD 6. 
The sp3 fraction of DLC films was from XPS 
fitting for C 1s core peak, consisting of peaks 
owing to diamond (285.1 eV), graphite 
(284.6 eV), and carbon–oxygen bonds 
formed (286.5 eV) phases. From the area of 
each peak was depended on the 
corresponding phase, the sp3 content was 
estimated by taking the ratio of diamond 
peak over the sum of diamond, graphite ,and 
carbon–oxygen bonds peak areas. Each 
component is using a convolution of a 
Gaussian of 80% and a Lorentzian of 20% 
method, and the background subtraction is 
approximated by the Shirley method. The 
Gaussian widths of the spectra for DLC films 
are 1.35 eV, and the component depend on 
sp2 and sp3 hybridization results in each 
specimen shifted by 0.5 eV. The carbon– 
oxygen adsorbate peak was fitted with a 
6 
and fractal investigations to determine the 
nanotribological characteristics of the 
deposited DLC films. Fractal analysis is 
essentially applied to characterize 
quantitatively the surface roughness of films 
measured by AFM. Moreover, fractal 
analysis has provided a valuable description 
of the irregularities found on DLC film 
surfaces, and the maximum hardness is 22.54 
GPa for the 20-nm-thick DLC films 
deposited as shown in specimen GD 5 with 
the probable sp3 content of 57.19%. The 
aforementioned NIP test results showed that 
the hardness behaviors of all as-deposited 
DLC films improved significantly with the 
increase of the sp3 content, and its hardness 
is larger than that of the non-coated one. 
Figure 5 show the typical load/displacement 
curves and wear marks on three-dimensional 
(3-D) and two-dimensional (2D) 
nanoindenter testing images for DLC films 
deposited with the corresponding line-scan 
analysis for the form at various the sputtering 
process parameters. The nanowear tests 
showed that the wear depth of each coated 
DLC film is around 4.3 nm for the applied 
loadings of 500 μN. NIP analysis results 
show that the depth of indentation should not 
exceed 10% of the thickness of the actual 
coatings during measurement of the hardness 
of the deposited films[26, 27]. However, due 
to this research’s limitations on the optical 
properties of DLC films, the depth of 
indentation of (e.g., specimen GD 1, GD 2, 
and GD5) exceed 10% of the thickness. 
Moreover, the average hardness values of the 
thin films are ranging from 13.2 to 22.5 GPa, 
and its hardness values is larger than that of 
non-coated of 6.86 GPa. It can be concluded 
that the effect of substrate hardness on the 
coating hardness in reference to NIP test was 
negligible.

3.6 Water and oil contact angle analysis of 
HFE /Sub-Micro-Structures surface of 
DLC Films 
The wettability of a solid surface is an 
important property of materials, which 
depends on the surface chemical composition 
and the surface geometrical micro-/ 
nanostructures. The adhesive force between 
textured surface and water droplet can be 
evaluated, and the structure effect can be 
deduced by comparing it with those of a 
single micro- or nano-scale structures[28]. 
Figures 8 and 9 show that DLC films were 
first deposited on D263T glass substrate 
under rf power of 150 W, working distance 
of 10 cm, working pressure of 3 mTorr, and 
deposition time of 20 mins. HFE thin films 
then were coated onto the substrate by using 
the dip coating after the sub-micro-structures 
surface of DLC films deposited. The dip 
coating conditions are as follows; the 
withdrawing speed is 1 mm/s and the 
HFE–coated are cured at 90oC for 60 mins. 
The sub-micro-structures surface of DLC 
film is formed by using reactive ion etching 
(RIE) process with argon and carbon 
tetrafluoride (CF4) plasma. The rf power and 
etching time are 100 W and 1h, respectively. 
The HFE/Sub-micro-structures surface of 
DLC films shows maximum water contact 
angle of 137o, as shown in Figure 8. On the 
other hand, the oil contact angles of the 
HFE/Sub-micro- structures surface of DLC 
films are above 101o, as shown in Figures 9.

4. Conclusions 
In this study, DLC films have been 
successfully deposited on D263T glass 
substrates at room temperature by rf 
magnetron sputtering method. The 
mechanical behavior of DLC/ D263T glass 
structures could be improved, obtaining a 
hardness of up to 18.02 GPa, a CA greater 
than 93°. The DLC films could display high 
transmissive ability (＞86%) in the visible 
wavelengths, which shows the possibility for 
their applications in display devices. 
Moreover, The water and oil contact angles 
of the HFE/Sub-micro-structures surface of 
DLC films are above 137o and 101o,
