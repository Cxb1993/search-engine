network topology (denoted by G), the studies [4] suggest
adding a new overlay link to G and removing an existing
one from G iteratively, such that the net operations can
reduce the total delay cost of overlay links. Compared with
Liu et al.’s algorithms, we present a novel topology matching
algorithm in this paper allowing the latency of routing a
scoped broadcast message from any node v to another other
node u approximating the minimum (i.e., the end-to-end
delay from v to u).
Hsiao et al. in [7] present a randomized algorithm to
identify a family of unstructured P2P networks that match
physical networks reasonably well. Consider a P2P network
G = (V,E) constructed by the algorithm in [7]. Let the
end-to-end delay between any two nodes in the physical
network be no more than L. Hsiao et al. [7] rigorously
show that any two nodes in G has the routing delay of
≤ Θ(L) in expectation. As Hsiao et al.’s solution provides
the guarantee in broadcasting a message from any node v to
another node u, we present in this paper a novel topology
matching algorithm that outperforms Hsiao et al.’s.
Small-world networks exhibit low diameter [8]. By diam-
eter, we mean the maximum hopcount of routing a message
on the shortest path (measured in terms of hopcount) be-
tween any two nodes in a given graph network G = (V,E).
Although a small-world network, G, has a low diameter,
the “delay” of routing a message between any two nodes
in G may not be necessarily small, considering that G is
layered on top of a physical network (e.g., the Internet).
Merugu et al. in their seminal study [9] conclude that there
exist some instances of small-world networks that can match
their physical network topologies. [9] does not detail how to
create such a small-world P2P network, however. In contrast,
in our study, we discuss how an unstructured P2P network
that well matches the physical network topology can be
constructed.
III. OUR PROPOSAL
As we mentioned in Section I, given an unstructured P2P
network (represented by G = (V,E)), our goal in this study
is to reshape G such that for any v, u ∈ V , minp∈Pv;u `p,
and |argminp∈Pv;u `p| are minimized as much as possible.
In the following discussion, we consider any node v ∈ V
that implements our proposal.
A. Constructing Long Links
Consider any G = (V,E) and any node v ∈ V . v in our
proposal samples nodes from V , and connects to a node w ∈
V − {v} with the probability of piv(w) =
1
αβ`αvw lnL
, where
`vw are the end-to-end delay of routing a message from v to
w, L is the maximum routing delay between any two nodes
in V , and α and β are the predefined system parameters. We
refer interested readers to [10] for the detailed discussion
for piv(·). Here, we denote those nodes linked by v due to
piv(·) by Wv . In our implementation, |Wv| is no more than
a predefined system threshold, denoted by C. It is obvious
that Wv may include a few nodes distant from v.
In our proposal, v implements the Metropolis-Hastings
method [5], [6] to sample nodes in order to collect Wv.
Specifically, v issues a biased random walker to the network
G. Let x be a peer in G that receives the walker. Then x
dispatches the walker to one (say y) of its overlay neighbors,
denoted by Gx (Gx = {y|xy ∈ E}), according to the
following probability:
Prx,y =


φTx,ymin
(
1,
piv(y)Ty,x
piv(x)Tx,y
)
if y ∈ Gx,
0 if y /∈ Gx,
1−
∑
w 6=x Prx,w if x = y,
(1)
where Tx,y =
1
degx
, φ is an arbitrarily positive value, and
0 < φ < 1 such that 1−
∑
w 6=x Prx,w > 0.
Notably, Eq. (1) allows a unique stationary probability
distribution such that v picks w from V with the probability
of piv(w). This is because (i) the Markov chain defined by
the probability transition matrix [Prx,y] is aperiodic (each
node has a positive probability to pick itself), (ii) irreducible
(there is a positive probability to pick any node from V ),
and (iii) time reversible (piv(x)Prx,y = piv(y)Pry,x for all
x 6= y ∈ V ).
B. Constructing Short Links
In addition to constructingWv, v shall link to the nodes in
the physical network proximity. Clearly, given any unstruc-
tured P2P networkG = (V,E) that have not been optimized,
any node v in G is unlikely to connect to geographically
closest nodes (represented by Bv) in the physical network,
resulting in
∑
u∈Gv
`vu >
∑
u∈Bv
`vu. Thus, our goal is to
reformatG, resulting in G′ = (V,E′), such that
∑
vu∈E′ `vu
in G′ is minimized.
Notably, while minimizing
∑
vu∈E′ `vu, we shall avoid
introducing extra resources (i.e., overlay connections) to
reformat G, and meanwhile, to prevent G from being
disconnected due to the removal of overlay connections.
Therefore, given G = (V,E), we reshape G and output
G′ = (V,E′) by solving the linear program problem as
follows:
min
∑
v∈V
∑
u∈V−{v}
xvu`vu (2)
s.t.
∑
v∈V
∑
u∈V−{v}
xvu = |E| (3)
degv ≤M (4)∑
vu∈E(U)
xvu ≥ 1 ∀U 6= ∅ ⊂ V (5)
xvu ∈ {0, 1} ∀v 6= u ∈ V (6)
where xvu is a binary variable indicating whether the edge
vu shall appear in G′ or not, degv is the number of
connections currently maintained by v, and E(U) = {vu|v ∈

Figure 1. The broadcast delay
which each participating peer samples nodes indepen-
dently and uniformly at random in the system, and
connects to those geographically close such that the
resultant overlay (denoted by Hsiao in this paper)
can match the physical network topology. Hsiao et
al. in [7] show that their constructed P2P network
guarantees the diameter of Θ(lnN ) hopcount. While
further considering the end-to-end delays with the
power-law distribution, if each peer performs polyloga-
rhimic samples and chooses those geographically close
as its neighbors, then the expected delay of sending
a message between any two nodes in the resultant
overlay network is a constant no more than L [7].
Here, L is the maximum end-to-end delay between
peers in the physical network. In addition to Hsiao,
our simulation study investigates Hsiao+THANCS that
optimizes Hsiao by having each participating peer
further perform THANCS.
• Ours and Ours+THANCS: Ours represents the P2P
network built by our proposal presented in this paper,
and Ours+THANCS optimizes Ours by THANCS.
Note that in our study, we have calibrated and optimized
the parameters (e.g., α, β, and T in our proposal) relevant
to the topology matching algorithms investigated. We refer
the readers to our technical report [10] for the details.
B. Comparative Study
Fig. 1 depicts the broadcast delay, that is minp∈Pv;u `p,
for any v ∈ V and u ∈ V − {v} (see the discussion
in Section I), in the optimized overlay topologies, namely,

Ours+THANCS. The coordinate (x, y) in Fig. 1 denotes

Figure 2. The broadcasting scope
the percentage of nodes, y, receiving a scoped broadcast
message with the delay no more than x. We also include
Random into Fig. 1 to represent the random graph for
optimization. Moreover, Physical as shown in the plot
denotes the end-to-end host delay in the physical network.
We notice that the simulation results discussed in this section
investigate the static network environment wherein peers do
not come and go freely. We will study the scenario that peers
dynamically join and leave in Section IV-C.
Fig. 1 reveals that our proposal (i.e., Ours) con-
siderably outperforms Random+THANCS, Hsiao, and
Hsiao+THANCS. Particularly, our proposal approximates
the minimum (i.e., physical). (Physical in Fig. 1 has
the lower bound of broadcast delay.) Notably, as shown
in Fig. 1, the performance gain due to THANCS (i.e.,
Random+THANCS, Hsiao+THANCS and Ours+THANCS)
heavily depends on the target overlay (i.e., Random, Hsiao
and Ours) to be optimized. While THANCS can greatly
improve Random, it only slightly improves Hsiao and
Ours.
Fig. 2 presents the “averaged” broadcast scope for the
studied networks. In this experiment, each node broadcasts a
message with TTL =∞, and we then compute the averaged
broadcast scope as
∑
v∈V
|Sv(k)|
N , where Sv(k) denotes the
set of distinct nodes receiving the broadcast messages; they
originate from a randomly selected node v at the hopcount
of k (k = 1, 2, 3, · · · ). Specifically, in Fig. 2, the coordi-
nate (x, y) denotes the percentage of nodes, y, receiving a
broadcast message at the hopcount of ≤ x. As we can see
from Fig. 2, all the Random, Random+THANCS, Hsiao,
Hsiao+THANCS, Ours, and Ours+THANCS exhibit the
exponential broadcast scope.
system operates for 10, 000 minutes, and the lifetime of a
participating peers follows the exponential distribution with
a mean of t = 20 minutes. The experimental result for a
larger mean lifetime (e.g., t = 200) is similar to what Fig. 4
depicts, and is thus omitted.
Similar to the experiment setting discussed previously,
in this experiment a peer in Random+THANCS performs
the THANCS algorithm every one simulated minute of the
system. In contrast, in Hsiao, a joining peer v issues 10
random walkers once it participates in the system. These
10 walkers sample nodes uniformly at random from the
network for v, and each of the walkers takes one walk step
per simulated minute. v may update its neighbors every one
simulated minute, depending on whether the sampled peers
are “valid” to be connected or not [7]. As for our proposal,
any participating peer v originates a single biased random
walker to sample the peers for its Wv (where |Wv| = 3).
Meanwhile, v performs the algorithm in Section III-B for
discovering Bv per simulated minute.
Fig. 4 shows that the averaged number of messages
generated by each peer, v, in our proposal is clearly
less than that of Random+THANCS. This is because in
Random+THANCS, v needs to collect its one- and two-
hop neighbors such that the THANCS algorithm can be
performed. In contrast, in our proposal, in addition to the
only one message introduced per simulated minute due
to the random walker of v, v collects one- and two-hop
neighbors for computing its Bv. However, compared with
upto 6 neighbors maintained by v in Random+THANCS, v
in our proposal links to no more than 3 neighbors in its Bv
and thus introduces less traffic.
Our proposal also outperforms Hsiao in terms of the
message overhead. This is mainly because each peer v in
Hsiao relies on a number of random walkers to sample
a sufficient number of valid peers as its neighbors, taking
more messages than those generated by our proposal.
V. SUMMARY
We have presented in this paper a novel, decentralized
topology matching algorithm for unstructured P2P networks.
We assess our proposal in extensive simulations. The sim-
ulation results not only reveal that our proposal is effective
in reformatting an unstructured P2P network such that
the resultant overlay matches well the physical network.
In addition, we compare our proposal to prior solutions,
including those of Liu et al. in [4] and Hsiao et al. in [7].
While Liu et al.’s, Hsiao et al.’s, and our proposal have
comparable broadcast scope, our design outperforms these
prior solutions considerably in terms of broadcast delay.
