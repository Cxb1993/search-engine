英文摘要: 
Identification of transcription factor binding sites is a major challenge to the understanding 
of gene expression regulation. Understanding the regulation of gene expression requires a 
complete knowledge of the regulation process and all related elements. One of the drawbacks of 
previous approaches is the high false positive rate of prediction. To overcome this problem, this 
project created a ChIP database and develop methods that integrate our system with new 
experimental techniques and related knowledge to improve accuracy of transcription factor 
binding site prediction. The proposed database collects various types of ChIP experimental results, 
integrates the tools used in analysis or representation of the ChIP data and will provide a useful 
interface for the database users. The creation of a ChIP database will be a significant contribution 
to experimental verified knowledge on transcription factor binding. The database knowledge is 
helpful for construction of a more accurate prediction model. We will then use the database to 
develop methods to predict transcription factor binding sites using real binding profiles from the 
ChIP database and an integration of new computational approaches. Inputted co-expressed genes 
will be clustered by the new approach and then used to discover conserved features in their 
upstream regions. Structural information such as phylogenetic conservation and the presence of 
CpG-islands will be used to improve the precision of prediction. Finally, biological functional 
analysis display of target genes will provide information on the biological regulation of gene 
function by transcription binding factors. 
The construction of the ChIP database system and the development of the proposed 
approach are expected to improve the accuracy of transcription factor binding site prediction. In 
addition, an accurate binding model should be developed that will reveal the real basis of cellular 
regulation mechanisms.

目的 
The specific aims are the creation of a database of chromatin immunoprecipitation 
experimental results and the use of this database to improve the accuracy transcription factor 
prediction. 
In the first step, we will focus on the creation of a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
database. High throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation methods such as ChIP-on-chip, ChIP- 
PET and SABE are reliable methods for the identification of genomic targets and have been 
widely used recently to study transcription regulation. There is no public databases designed 
specifically for ChIP assays that integrate the various types of ChIP assay; hence, there is a need 
to create such a ChIP database. We will collect ChIP data from existing databases such as NCBI 
GEO and TransFAC as well as the published literature. Our collaborator is responsible for the 
production of ChIP data using SABE. The results produced by this approach will need to be 
integrated and stored in a standard format before being applied at a later stage during large scale 
genome comparisons. Tools will be developed and integrated in the database for target 
identification and binding model construction. The creation of the ChIP database will be a 
significant contribution to gene regulation analysis. 
After the development of the database, we will focus on the construction of the prediction 
model. A two-stage clustering method will be applied to obtain gene expression clustering. Next, 
we will use phylogenetic footprinting to reduce the false positive rate for binding site 
identification and cis-module construction. Real binding sites in our proposed ChIP database will 
next be used to construct cis-modules. Some promoters in particular regions, specifically inactive 
regions, that show a richness of binding sites but a lack of binding/expression, will be identified. 
These inactive regions have not been considered in previous studies but will be included in this 
project. We believe that the identification of such inactive areas will help us to reduce the noise 
during cis-module identification. Through the use of real binding data from the ChIP database, 
we expect to tune the prediction model such that there will be a significant improvement in the 
accuracy of transcription factor binding site prediction.  
Finally we will test our system by applying it and comparing it with chromatin 
immunoprecipitation experiments produced by our group. The experimental verification will be 
carried out by our collaborator Professor An-Ping Tsou, who will assist in the development, 
improvement and verification of our prediction system.

output [21].  
Alternatively, Faith et al. adopted a machine learning approach to map TF expression to 
expression targets directly [22]. In addition, the matching score of a motif can be considerate 
during the mapping because the stability of TF binding may affect the ability of the regulation 
module to regulate. In this context, Das et al. uses a linear spline approach to model the 
relationship between TFs and the targets’ expression levels using the PWM scores to optimize an 
appropriate cutoff for the various different motifs under different conditions [23]. As stated earlier, 
sampling conditions are usually vary too much to allow the definition of global modules. As a 
result of this, some studies have focused on a specific module under specific conditions; these 
include tissue specific modules [16, 23-25] or temporal specific modules [17, 25]. 
Phylogenetic footprinting 
Phylogenetic footprinting is wildly used in recent analysis of transcription regulation to 
advantage the prediction accuracy. ConSite [26, 27] is a web-based tool for discovering 
cis-regulatory elements. It uses known transcription factor binding profile to discover putative 
binding site. The putative binding sites are compared with conservation region of globally aligned 
orthologous upstreams to filter the conserved binding site. CNBs are calculated by 50 bps sliding 
window. rVista [28] uses known site PSSM to scan the positions of putative transcription factor 
binding site. A 21 bps sliding window is used to evaluate the binding sites conservation. 
CONREAL [29, 30] analyzes the order and the sequence of transcription factor binding matrix in 
human and mouse orthologous promoter. Three different alignment algorithms used to find 
conserved transcription factor binding site. Footer [31, 32] is also based on phylogenetic 
footprinting algorithm. It combines two probability scoring function to scores putative binding 
sites based on the relative position of sites in the promoter. Algorisms are described in before that 
needs prior information of transcription factor binding site. An enumerative method combines 
phylogenetic footprinting for transcription factor binding site prediction [33, 34]. The occurrence 
of all possible binding sequences is scanned and then filter by gene function annotation and gene 
expression profile. The method finds not only known transcription factor binding site but also 
novel binding sites.

The Ensembl Compara databases store the results of genomewide species comparisons. The 
comparative genomic dataset contains pairwise whole genome alignment results, ortholog 
predictions and protein family clusters. We used the ortholog predictions from the Ensembl 
Compara databases. The orthologous genes in Ensembl Compara databases represent the best 
reciprocal BLAST hits for the two species. The pairs are obtained by a combination of BLAST 
and location information for more closely related species. This is because the orthologous genes 
identified are necessarily the only potential ortholougs and one gene may map to more than two 
genes in the Ensembl Compara databases. The orthologous gene pairs we use in the Mootprinting 
database are gene pairs that come from related chromosomes. The number of orthologous gene 
pairs present in the Mootprinting database is 19075. 
 
We used the BLAST 2 Sequence program [17] rom the NCBI BLAST software package to 
find local alignments between two sequences. Blast 2 Sequence program is a tool based on 
BLAST for aligning two protein or nucleotide sequences. BLAST 2 uses the BLAST algorithm for 
pairwise DNA–DNA or protein–protein sequence comparisons and evaluates the statistical 
significance of matches. BLAST 2 Sequence program allows user to postulate evolutionary and 
functional relationships between sequences. 
The BLAST 2 Sequence program version 2.2.12 aligned the human and mouse gene upstream 
nucleotide sequences using the standard parameters of ‘-p blastn’ and the default matrix 
BLOSUM62. There are 19,073 human and mouse orthologous gene pairs in the analyzed Ensembl 
Core databases. After alignment, we obtained the following information. If the alignment started 
from exon 1 upstream, there are 19,050 orthologous genes that have conserved regions. The 
average number of conserved regions per gene pair is 8.62 and the average length of the conserved 
regions is 25.12 bp. If the alignment starts from the translation start site upstream, there are 19,056 
orthologous genes that have conserved regions. The average number of conserved regions per 
gene pair is 9.39 and the average length of the conserved regions is 26.71bp. 
The system flow

looks up locations of the motif quickly by searching the suffix array files. 
For checking whether the motif is in a conserved region, the first step is to obtain all 
orthologous gene pair using an Ensembl Perl API from the Ensembl Compara database. Next the 
upstream sequences of orthologous gene pairs are retrieved by Ensembl Perl API from the 
species-specific Ensembl Core databases. The upstream sequences are aligned by BLAST. To 
speed up checking conserved region process, the alignment results are stored in Mootprinting 
database. The conserved regions are then mapped to the binary file. The binary file first is filled 
with ‘\0’, and the conserved regions are converted into binary file locations. The conserved region 
part of the binary file is filled by ASCII code except for ‘\0’. When we want to check whether the 
motif location is in the conserved region, we can convert the motif location to a file location and 
check the file location character. When the file location character is not ‘\0’, we can know that the 
motif is in the conserved region. We can use binary file indexing to reduce the time needed to 
search the conserved regions in database. 
Identification of transcription factors 
At first, users submit a DNA binding motif, which can be based on the transcription 
regulatory sites or analysis of sequences that could be a TFBS. The system searches all locations 
of the motif within human and mouse upstream sequences, and estimates whether the location is in 
a conserved region or not. The system then calculates the numbers of locations in conserved 
regions that are conserved for each orthologous gene pair. The location information and the 
location summations for the orthologous gene pairs are stored into Mootprinting database. After 
completing the above steps, the users can now input a set of genes, which may be based on gene 
expression analysis. The system retrieves the submitted genes data from the pre-calculated motif 
database. The system integrates the motif location for the whole genome relative to the submitted 
gene group and then the system displays the statistics for the gene group compared to the whole 
genomes. 
The statistics use the χ2 test. The χ2 test [37] is used to test the significance of deviation from 
an expected value. The closer the observed frequencies are to the expected frequencies, the greater 
the weight of evidence in favor of independence. When the χ2 test values exceed the threshold 
value of 3.84 with 2 degrees of freedom and the α is 0.05, we say that the gene group is correlated 
to (or dependent on) the motif in conserved region. χ2 test value is defined as 
𝜒2 =∑
(𝑂𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 − 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑒𝑑)2

Figure  shows the data input page. The first step when using the system is the inputting of a 
motif. Using this page, users can input DNA binding patterns by extended IUPAC code (A, T, C, 
G, R:A/G, S:C/G, W:A/T, Y:C/T, M:A/C, K:G/T, V:A/C/G, H:A/C/ T, D:A/G/T, B:C/G/T, 
N:A/C/G/T). Users can then input a case name, choose the initial species and the species to be 
compared with, the start position for the gene coding regions, the end position for the coding 
regions, whether the case is a public case or a private case, and a description of the case. When 
motif searching is finished, the completed case can be found on the case page. We can then input a 
gene group to the summary page. The gene group data can be Ensembl Gene IDs, UniGene IDs, 
Gene Symbols or Locus IDs. We suggest that the use of the Ensembl Gene ID is better because 
these Ids, except for Ensembl Gene Ids, may map genes to more than two sites per species or may 
not map to the gene at all in the current Ensembl database.

Random data set testing 
Myc is a transcription factor of the basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) family 
that can influence the activation or repression of genes. Myc activates gene expression through 
another bHLH-LZ protein, Max, and binds to the DNA sequence CACGTG, which is called the 
E-box. Myc represses gene expression via transcription factor binding, for example, Miz-1, by 
binding to various different DNA sequences. Fernandez et al. [48] studied Myc target genes by 
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay is used to identify 
the binding of transcription factors. We used the Myc-target genes as a case study. We submitted 
the CACGTG motif, starting from exon 1 with an upstream range from -2000 to -1 into the system. 
Table  shows the location distribution of the E-box in human and mouse upstream regions. There 
are 546 orthologous gene pairs that both have this motif in a conserved region across 19,073 
orthologous gene pairs. In total, there are 7793 orthologous gene pairs that have the CACGTG 
motif in their gene upstream sequences.

"With conserved Motif" means that there is a motif located in upstream conserved region. "w/o

Motif" means that there is no motif located in upstream sequence. For example, there are 546 
orthologous gene pairs having motifs in the conserved region of human and mouse upstream regions. 
There are 138 orthologous gene pairs that have motif in the conserved region of human but do not 
have a motif in the mouse upstream regions. Users can click the link to the integer to view the genes 
meet these specific criteria. 
 
We submitted the gene symbols that were provided by Fernandez et al. [48]  except for H4/b 
and H4/e. The H4/b and H4/e gene symbols are associated with 28 genes in the Ensembl database 
and this made analysis very difficult. Therefore, the H4/b and H4/e gene symbols were eliminated 
from our analysis. Finally, we submit a total of 255 Myc-target genes and five groups of 255 
random genes into the system. The results are shown in Table .

The analysis of gene expression is able to identify many possible transcription factor 
regulated gene groups. It has been proven that the phylogenetic footprinting method can help to 
identify transcription factor binding sites. Our work develops an expert system that combines 
motif searching and phylogenetic footprinting. After a motif and a gene group are submitted, the 
expert system is able to evaluate the statistics of the motif’s appearance across all genes in genome 
and in gene upstream conserved regions by comparing human and mouse. A transcription 
factor-target gene group was used to test the proposed system. The results show that the system is 
able to distinguish transcription factor-target gene groups from random gene groups. By 
comparing motif distribution between all genes and a gene group, the proposed system is able to 
help biologists identify possible transcription factor regulated gene groups that have co-regulated 
gene expression

synexpression group, namely, the T3>T1 gene group. The binding motifs of the evolutionarily 
conserved transcription factors tend to reside in human-mouse conserved non-coding blocks 
(CNBs) within the promoter regions of the putative target genes [41, 56] To unravel the SOX4 
targets, we use our Mootprinting system based on phylogenetic footprinting to identify SOX4 
binding motifs in the T3>T1 gene group. A degenerate consensus motif, WWCAAWG 
((A/T)(A/T)CAA(A/T)G), which accommodates the known SOX4 binding motifs, 
AACAA(A/T)G was used.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A group of 41 genes containing at least one binding motif in their CNBs was retrieved from 
the T3>T1 gene group(Table ). Forty-seven binding motifs in the CNBs were identified. The 
motifs demonstrated a broad distribution of spatial locations. Sixteen motifs were located >1 Kb 
upstream from the TSS, six sites were in intron 1 and three sites were in the 5’UTR regions. ChIP 
assays were performed to discover if these motifs are functional binding sites for SOX4 as show in 
Table . 
ChIP is a powerful technique for analyzing transcription factor binding sites in living cells. 
We performed ChIP assays with Mahlavu cells to detect sites binding the SOX4 fusion protein. As 
shown in Figure (a), SOX4 protein formed complexes with the predicted motifs of 31 genes but 
failed to bind to the predicted motifs of 10 genes. These results indicated a 76% positive 
prediction rate. The specificity of the ChIP assay was further confirmed using HCC cells 
transfected with an unrelated HA-FOXQ1 gene construct. To clarify the SOX4 transcriptional 
regulatory mechanism, we examined the effect of silencing NRP1 and SEMA3C on cell migration. 
Knock-down of NRP1 and SEMA3C drastically reduced cell migration and invasion activity in 
HCC cells (Figure  (b)). This result lends support to the idea that SOX4 affects cell migration 
partly via regulation of its downstream target genes; thus NRP1 and SEMA3C are effectors while 
SOX4 is an upstream instigator in the chain of regulation.

We use Mootprinting system as a regulation targets identification tool based on phylogenetic 
footprinting. 41 putative targets was identified form 616 genes of T3>T1 highly expressed genes. 
A multifaceted approach integrating gene profiling, binding site computation and empirical 
verification by chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene ablation refined the consensus SOX4 
binding motif and identified 32 binding loci in 31 genes with high confidence. RNAi-knockdown 
reduced cell migration activity in HCC cell lines suggesting that SOX4 exerts some of its action 
via regulation of these two downstream targets. The discovery of 31 previously unidentified 
targets expands our knowledge of how SOX4 modulates HCC progression and implies a range of 
novel SOX4 functions. Over 75% putative targets were confirmed by biological experiments. It 
shows that our approach is efficient and accurate in identification of regulation targets.

學術成就 
  研究基因表現的調控機制需要對於調控過程與參與其中的元素有完整的認識。傳統的以
計算方式辨識特定基因群的調控因子的系統，存在過高的假陽性的問題。本研究利用遺傳
因子演化保留性的特性，設計了一個方法來檢驗可能的調控因子與被它調控的基因之間的
相關聯性。應用此一方法於 616 個在肝癌中有高度表現的基因群中，發現並確認 SOX4 為
主要調控因子，並且同時預測在其中有 41 個基因為其下游被調控基因。經由生物實驗驗
證後確認其中 31 個基因的確在癌肝細胞株中被 SOX4 所調控影響癌化進程。 
 
技術創新 
  本研究結合生物資訊分析方法與生物實驗方法於單一整合之流程中，籍由過程中之生物
知識判斷與調控因子驗證步驟來取得可信賴的調控因子。運用此一驗證過之結果來進一步
預測由該調控因子所調控之基因，經由實驗證明本方法能得到非常準確的結果。由此可證
明本研究成果可以有效提昇在基因調控研究中預測調控因子與調控目標的效能，對於建立
正確完整的基因調控網路與研究調控機制有非常大的助益。
