INTRODUCTION 
1.1 SOYBEAN OIL DEODORIZATION DISTILLATE 
 Practically all commercial vegetable oils produced worldwide are refined oils (pure 
triacylglycerols, TAGs). Crude vegetable oils contain impurities or by-product such as gums 
(phospatides), waxes, metals, free fatty acids (FFAs), colored particles and substances, 
diacylglyecrols (DAGs), monoacylglycerols (MAGs), odoriferous components (aldehydes and 
ketones), pesticides, herbicides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). They can 
negatively affect the taste and smell of oils.     
Refining can be done by chemical refining or physical refining (Figure 1-1). The physical 
process is technically more costly. However, it requires only three processing steps, whereas the 
conventional process may need up to four. The main advantage of physical refining is its 
environmental friendliness. Effluent is drastically reduced, FFAs are recovered as such without 
soap splitting and refining loss is lower. The disadvantage is that for some oils more careful 
degumming is required (Bockisch, 1998; Poku, 2002; Teoh, 2002).  
In physical refining, FFAs are vaporized during the deodorization process. Consequently the 
distillate contains mainly FFAs (>70%) with only small amounts of unsaponiables (5-10 %) and 
is usually sold as a source of technical fatty acids (Verleyen et al., 2001). In chemical refining, 
FFAs are neutralized by caustic solution and washed out of the oil before deodorization. The 
deodorizer distillate from chemical refining thus has a lower FFAs content (30-50%) and a higher 
level of unsaponifiables ranging between 25 and 33% (De Greyt et al., 2000). 
Hydrocarbons are the least polar compounds of the unsaponifiable matter of vegetable oils. 
The presence of these compounds was detected in the 1940s, when Jasperson and Jones 
encountered in the deodorization distillates from several vegetable oils, large amounts of terpenic 
hydrocarbons accompanied by smaller amounts of n-alkanes. Crude vegetable oils contain 
elements of the n-alkane series from C10 to C35, the odd numbered elements being the most 
abundant. Other hydrocarbons were also detected in low concentration. Among them are 
n-alkenes, sesquiterpenenic (farnesene), terpenic (kaurene), carotenes, low-molecular-mass 
aromatics (from benzene to tetramethylbenzene, including styrene), and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbon (mainly those of low molecular mass).   
In refined vegetable oil, new hydrocarbons are formed as consequences of reactions occurring 
during the refining process such as bleaching with acidic earth and deodorization at high 
temperature. These hydrocarbons include steroidal hydrocarbons from the dehydration of 
phytosterols, terpenic hydrocarbons from terpenic alcohols, and other compounds deriving from 
squalene isomerization (Moreda et al., 2001). Each Δ5-phytosterols give rise to three sterene 
isomers (steroidal skeleton) with the two double bonds at 3,5 -; 2,4 – and 2,5 – positions, the first 
one being the most abundant. Among these steroidal hydrocarbons, the stigmadienes are the most 
abundant in all refined vegetables oil since they derive from β-sitosterol by dehydration. In 
another study, Goh et al. (1985) reported that squalene, sesquiterpene, diterpene, paraffinic

1.2 FREE FATTY ACIDS (FFAs) 
FFAs in SODD have low quality due to harsh conditions in the processing steps which 
resulted in reactions such as oxidation, cis-trans conversion etc (Mendes et al., 2002). These fatty 
acids have limited use such as for the production of biodiesel and as fluidizing agents for lecithin.   
Trans fatty acids (TFAs) are mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids with one or more double 
bonds in the trans configuration. In crude vegetable oils, double bonds are nearly always in the 
cis configuration with the hydrogen atoms sterically located on the same side of the double bond . 
Because of the low activation energy (125 kJ/mol), TFAs are relatively easily formed at elevated 
temperatures (e.g. during deodorization or hydrogenation). 
TFAs have structures comparable to saturated fatty acids so they have higher melting point 
than the corresponding cis isomer, as shown in Table 1-2 (De Greyt et al., 1999). Interest in TFAs 
is due to the epidemiological evidence that linked TFAs intake with higher plasma total and 
low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations and increased mortality from coronary heart 
disease (Mensink and Katan, 1990; Willet et al., 1993; Judd et al., 1994). Although there is 
controversy over the possible health effect of TFAs, most health organizations advice not to 
increase current average intakes. 
In general, three different dietary sources of TFAs can be distinguished: ruminant fats, 
partially hydrogenated fats, and refined oils. Ruminant fats are the only natural source of TFAs 
with vaccenic acid (11-trans 18:1) as the predominant one. On the other hand, partially 
hydrogenated fats are known as major dietary source of TFAs. Besides saturation of double bonds, 
partial hydrogenation is also characterized by the positional and geometrical isomerization of 
double bonds, resulting in large amounts of trans 18:1 isomers. Refined oils contain only a 
limited amount of TFAs, mainly trans 18:2 and 18:3 isomers formed during deodorization.

Squalene and squalane were found to be equally effective and squalene was preferred because 
of its greater stability. Squalane is a free-flowing oil and has been used in pharmaceuticals and as 
skin lubricant, as ingredient in suppositories, and as a vehicle for lipophilic drugs. Squalene in 
Syntex Adjuvant Formulation conforms to National Formulary guidelines and is used at a final 
concentration of 5% (w/v). Microfluidized squalene or squalene emulsions are efficient adjuvant, 
eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses. Squalane or squalene emulsions have been 
administered in human cancer vaccines, with mild side effects and evidence of efficacy, in terms 
of both immune response and antitumor activity (Allison, 1999). 
 
1.4 TOCOPHEROLS / TOCOTRIENOLS 
Tocopherols and tocotrienols (known as tocochromanols) are organic compounds that are 
found in plant material. These compounds are important because they retard the oxidation and 
spoilage of plant matter. Tocochromanols are also components of vitamin E and posses similar 
general structural features. Tocochromanols generally have an aromatic chromanol head and 
16-carbon hydrocarbon tail. The number and position of methyl substituents in the chromanol 
nucleus give rise to the α−,β−,γ− and δ−homologues. Saturation of the hydrocarbon chain 
differentiates tocopherols from tocotrienols with an unsaturated chain as shown in Figure 1-2 
(IUPAC-IUB recommendations of 1982).   
Each form has its own biological activity, which is the measure of potency or functional use 
in the body (Traber and Packer, 1995). Such activities include platelet aggregation and 
antioxidant functions (Niki et al., 1989; Fukuzawa et al., 1989). Alpha tocopherol is the most 
active form of vitamin E in humans (d-α-tocopherol, d-β-tocopherol, d-γ-tocopherol, 
d-δ-tocopherol, and d-α-tocotrienol showing, respectively, 1.49, 0.75, 0.30, 0.15 and 0.45 units of 
activity (Machlin, 1984)). It is also a powerful biological antioxidant (Traber, 1999; Farrell and 
Roberts, 1994). Non-α-tocopherol can be converted into α-tocopherol by well-known techniques, 
such as methylation (Gast et al., 2005). Vitamin E in supplements is usually sold as 
alpha-tocopheryl acetate, a form that protects its ability to function as an antioxidant. The 
synthetic form is labeled “d,l” while the natural form is labeled “d”. The synthetic form is only 
half as active as the natural form (Burton et al., 1998; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2004). A 
mixture of α-, γ- and δ- isomers containing 60 wt% tocopherols is widely utilized as an additive 
to various kinds of foods including fats and oils.  
Antioxidants such as vitamin E act to protect cells against the effect of free radicals, which 
are potentially damaging by-products of energy metabolism. Vitamin E has also been shown to 
play a role in immune function, in DNA repair, and other metabolic processes (Traber, 1999; 
Farrell and Roberts, 1994).  
High serum cholesterol levels are implicated in numerous diseases and disorders. A decrease 
in low density lipoproteins (LDLs) and/or an increase in the ratio of high density lipoproteins 
(HDLs) to LDLs will lower the risk of heart disease and retard the progression of the 
abovementioned diseases and disorders. Tocopherols and tocotrienols are two classes of 
compounds that are known to have a beneficial effect on the level of cholesterol in the 
 7
chemical hydrogenation.  
Phytosterols nomenclature is confusing. The two main nomenclature (Figure 1-3) currently 
utilized follow the IUPAC-IUB recommendations of 1976 and 1989. Phytosterols by their 
common names and the IUPAC-IUB recommendations of 1976 will be used in this study. A 
convenient way to describe and catalog phytosterols is to divide them based on the number of 
methyl groups on carbon-4 and based on common forms (Figure 1-4).

LITERATURE REVIEWS 
2.1  ISOLATION OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS FROM DEODORIZER DISTILLATE 
Since bioactive compounds are minor components in deodorizer distillate, enrichment is vital 
before they can be fractionated and separated into individual compound. Numerous methods have 
been proposed for treating deodorizer distillate to isolate one or more components. Tocopherols 
and free phytosterols are among the compounds of nutritional interest that are frequently purified 
from deodorizer distillate. These methods are protected by patent and technical details about them 
are scarce. Most of these methods are complicate and expensive. The isolation of squalene, 
FASEs, tocopherols and free phytosterols from deodorizer distillate in high yield and purity 
remains a challenge.   
Deodorizer distillate typically contains high level of FFAs and TAGs and efficient removal of 
them is crucial for the enrichment of bioactive compounds. Difficulties associated with separating 
tocopherols and/or free phytosterols from deodorizer distillate are that they have similar boiling 
points because they have similar molecular weight. Tocopherols are prone to degradation if either 
high-temperature (Helme, 1984; Copeland and Belcher, 2004; Fizet, 1996) or alkaline condition 
is involved (Lietz and Henry, 1997).  
During esterification of FFAs in deodorizer distillate, the addition of strong acid greatly 
accelerates the reaction, which also applies to the undesired esterification of the tocopherols 
(Fizet, 1996). Tocopherols levels decreased about 11%, 25%, 38% and 61% for ½ h processing 
during deodorization step at 240, 260, 280 and 300oC, respectively (Helme, 1984).  
One difficulty associated with separating squalene and/or FASEs from deodorizer distillate 
are that their polarities are roughly the same and FASEs are prone to degradation if either high 
temperature (Verleyen et al., 2001), acid (Fizet, 1996) or alkaline condition is involved (Moreau 
et al., 2002). Furthermore, it has been reported that prolonged exposure to alkaline conditions 
resulted in significant losses of squalene (Moreda et al., 2001). 
  Tocopherols have been purified from deodorizer distillate in industrial scale by a combination 
of molecular distillation, ethanol fractionation, chemical alcoholysis, and ion-exchange 
chromatography. Extractive isolation of tocopherols by cold ethanol did not produce high yield 
and purity. The recoveries of tocopherols are less than 75 %, because a part of tocopherols 
coprecipitates with free phytosterols (Shimada et al., 2000).    
There are several methods for removing FFAs and acylglycerols: hydrolysis, esterification, 
transesterification, distillation, crystallization, adsorption, and liquid-liquid extraction. The first 
three methods are either chemical or enzymatic process, and the next three are physical process. 
 
2.1.1 Chemical Process 
In many of these methods, a first essential step involves subjecting deodorizer distillate to an 
esterification or saponification reaction. For example, in an early work (Hickman, 1944); 
deodorizer distillate was subjected to high vacuum, unobstructed path distillation. A distillate 
 11
by employing non-specific SP 382 lipase. Free phytosterols and tocopherols were then 
concentrated in the residue fraction by distillation. The conversion of FAMEs was 96%, while a 
small amount of FFAs was left in the residue. Free phytosterols and tocopherols were enriched 
1.5 times and 1.7 times, respectively. The total recoveries of free physterols and tocopherols were 
17.56% and 21.48%, respectively.  
Ghosh and Bhattacharyya (1996) proposed a method for the purification of tocopherols and 
free phytosterols from SuODD. Hydrolysis by Candida cylindracea lipase was applied to convert 
acylglycerols into fatty acids and glycerol. Mucor miehei lipase was then applied to the 
hydrolyzed deodorizer distillate to esterify fatty acids into their corresponding butyl ester. Butyl 
esters were then separated from the esterified deodorizer distillate via fractional distillation at 
180-230oC for 45 min. A second fraction containing tocopherols and free phytosterols was 
obtained at 230-260oC for 15 min. The total recovery of tocopherols is about 70.2% with 30.1 
wt% purity. The total recovery of free phytosterols is about 41.9% with 36.4 wt % purity. 
Purification of tocopherols from SODD was carried out by Shimada et al. (2000). SODD 
was distilled using molecular distillation at 250oC and 0.02 mmHg and the resulting distillate was 
used as a starting material. Candida rugosa or Pseudomonas sp lipase was then applied to the 
mixture to efficiently esterify free phytosterols into their corresponding esters and concurrently 
MAGs were hydrolyzed at 35oC for 24 h. FASEs were recovered as residue from the reaction 
mixture via molecular distillation at 250oC and 0.2 mmHg. However, the last molecular 
distillation failed to separate FFAs and tocopherols. A second esterification of free phytosterols 
was applied at 35oC for 24 h, followed by another four-stage molecular distillation (160oC and 
0.2 mmHg, 200oC and 0.2 mmHg, 230oC and 0.04 mmHg, and 255oC and 0.03 mmHg) yielded 
tocopherols with purity and recovery of about 65.3 wt% and 54.6%, respectively.  
Hirota et al. (2003) isolated naturally occurring FASEs from SODD. SODD was distilled 
using molecular distillation at 250oC and 0.02 mmHg and the resulting residue was rich in DAGs 
and TAGs. Lipolysis was then conducted to selectively hydrolyze DAGs and TAGs at 35oC for 24 
h, resulting in a mixture from which fatty acid steryl esters were readily purified using two-stage 
molecular distillation (180oC and 0.2 mmHg, and 250oC and 0.02 mmHg). The recovery and 
purity of FASEs were about 87.7% and 97.3 wt%, respectively  
Watanabe et al. (2004) purified tocopherols and free phytosterols as their esters from SODD. 
SODD was distilled using molecular distillation at 240oC and 0.02 mmHg and the resulting 
distillate rich in FFAs, free physterols and MAGs. A two-step in situ reaction catalyzed by 
Candida rugosa lipase was then applied to the distillate. In the first step, the esterification of free 
phytosterols with FFAs and the hydrolysis of acylglycerols were carried out at 30oC for 16 h. In 
the second step, the esterification of FFAs with methanol was conducted 30oC for 24 h. FASEs 
were not affected by the reaction. FAMEs were separated from tocopherols (and fatty acid steryl 
asters) via molecular distillation at 160oC and 0.2 mmHg. Tocopherols were separated from fatty 
acid steryl asters via molecular distillation at 240oC and 0.02 mmHg. The total recovery of free 
phytosterols as their corresponding esters is about 86.3% with 97.2 wt % purity. The resulting 
tocopherol-rich distillate was subjected to a two-step in situ reaction. In the first step, 
esterification of free phytosterols with FFAs and hydrolysis of acylglycerols were carried out at 
 13
Adsorption is competitive with distillation for bulk separation when relative volatility is less 
than about 1.25 (Ruthven 1984). In the vegetable oil refining industry, adsorption is involved in 
bleaching or decolourization of oils using activated earth or clays as adsorbent. Study of selective 
adsorption of undesirable components from unrefined oils could lead to increased efficiency of 
refining methods, a better understanding of bleaching procedures, as well as a better control of 
the physcochemical / functional properties of refined oils. Chu et al. (2004) separated vitamin E 
from palm fatty acid distillate using silica in batch adsorption. It was found that Redlich-Peterson 
and Langmuir isotherm models described the equilibrium data reasonably well and 
thermodynamic parameters of the adsorption further confirmed the exothermic nature of the 
adsorption process. The overall Gibbs free energy change during the adsorption process was 
negative for the experimental range of temperatures (35 – 50oC), corresponding to spontaneous 
adsorption. Two main adsorption mechanisms were involved during vitamin E adsorption, 
namely external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion. It was noted that increasing the initial 
vitamin E concentration resulted in a decrease in kf (external mass transfer coefficient) values, but 
an increase in kid (rate constant of intraparticle diffusion). 
None of the above methods for isolating one or more components from a deodorizer distillate 
has proved satisfactory. Methods employing an esterification or saponification step introduce 
processing complexity and require later processing steps that often involve the use of strong 
mineral acids in order to convert FASEs into free sterols and FFAs, or soaps into FFAs. Mineral 
acids can be dangerous in handling and can induce discoloration or other degradation of distillate 
components (Copeland and Belcher, 2004).  
The main disadvantage of using enzyme is the cost due to its stability and reusability. 
However, denaturization of bioactive compounds can be suppressed (Moreira and Baltanas, 2004). 
Methods employing extractive steps are expensive and risk contamination by residual solvent. 
Molecular distillation is by far the preferred method to isolate both thermo sensitive and 
high-molecular-weight compounds from deodorizer distillate. Molecular distillation requires 
operation under a high temperature and a high vacuum with expensive equipment.  
The development of new separation techniques has gained increasing importance in chemical, 
food, and pharmaceutical industries, due to the imposed environmental regulations and the 
necessity of minimizing energy requirement. 
 
2.2 BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS ANALYSIS IN DEODORIZER DISTILLATE 
 Several techniques are available to provide a detailed analysis of one or more compounds in 
deodorizer distillates. Tocopherols and free phytosterols are among the lipids of nutritional 
interest that are frequently determined in deodorizer distillate. The two species are commonly 
analyzed by GC as well as by HPLC. A advantage of HPLC compared to GC is that derivatization 
and silylation is not necessary. However, the application of HPLC is limited by the lack of 
separation of tocopherols and free phytosterols under similar conditions. If data on both are 
required it is possible to determine them in the same analysis by GC under similar conditions 
(Slover et al., 1983). Therefore, GC is the most applied technique in the analysis of deodorizer 
distillate. A convenient way to describe and catalog analytical procedures that have been 
 15
characterized following the ester bond cleavage of aliphatic and steryl ester by saponification. 
This approach gives useful information about their composition but prevents the recognition of 
individual steryl ester and thus valuable information is lost. In addition, this pretreatment can 
possibly result in misleading conclusions if FASEs have not been rigorously purified to remove 
other saponifiable impurities, such as wax esters and acylglycerols.  
The separation of intact FASEs mixture by HPLC can be achieved by reversed-phase 
chromatography (Billheimer et al., 1983; Gordon and Griffith, 1992). However, the application of 
this technique is limited by the lack of resolution of different FASEs and the relative poor 
detection limits (Evershed et al., 1987).  The lack of a strong chromophore means that 10-50 μg 
of each component is generally required for analysis (Carrol and Rudel, 1981).  
Although reversed-phase HPLC systems gave good resolution of cholesteryl ester mixtures 
containing only unsaturated fatty acyl moieties, some problems of unresolved peaks found with 
the introduction of one or more double bonds into the fatty acyl group. 
Individual FASEs have been identified by GC-EI-MS and GC-CI-MS using different reagent 
gases such as ammonia, methane, and isobutane (Murata et al., 1975; Evershed et al., 1987; 
Kamm et al., 2001; Jover et al., 2002). Positive chemical ionization with ammonia as ionization 
gas is the only ionization method able to generate intense ions indicative of the molecular mass of 
FASEs (Evershed et al., 1987; Kamm et al., 2001; Jover et al., 2002). Kamm et al. (2001) applied 
online LC-GC-FID and PCI-MS confirmation to characterize FASEs in cocoa butter. In this 
method, phytosteryl esters mixtures containing palmitate moieties were separated in good 
resolution but phytosteryl esters with C18 moieties (such as campesteryl stearate, -oleate, 
and –linoleat) were not resolved. In addition, the disadvantages of the chemical ionization (CI) 
employed in GCMS over electron impact ionization (EI) are that it requires sophisticated 
equipment. 
 
2.3 REASEARCH AIMS 
Soybean oil is the most important vegetable oil in the world, representing 30% of the 
consumption in the world market. During the refining of soybean oil large quantity of by-product, 
known as SODD, is produced. The amount of Taiwan SODD can be seen in Table 2-1 (Perng, 
2005).

3.2 EQUIPMENTS 
Figure 3-1 shows the soxhlet extractor used in this study. The extractor is equipped with a 
jacket to control the temperature of extraction chamber. An allihn condenser with a straight outlet 
tube on top and a water cooled drip at bottom was obtained from commercial source. Mantle 
heater for flask with controller, MN-500C, (500 mL capacity and 300 watts power) was obtained 
from NewLab (Taiwan). The refrigerated circulating bath (Ming Yuh, Taiwan), with ethanol as 
the refrigerant, supplies coolant for the jacket. Rotary evaporator, equipped with a water bath, a 
vertical condenser, and a water vacuum pump was obtained from Eyela (Tokyo, Japan).  
Figure 3-2 shows the modified column chromatography used in this study. It is equipped 
 19
(15m x 0.32mm i.d.; Agilent Tech. Palo Alto, California). Temperatures of the injector and the 
detector were both set at 370oC. The temperature of the column was started at 80oC, and was 
increased to 365oC at 15oC/min and maintained at 365oC for 8 min. The split ratio was 1:50 using 
nitrogen as the carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30 cm/s at 80oC. A 20-mg sample was 
dissolved in 1 mL ethyl acetate, and a 1 μL sample was taken and injected into the HT-GC.

3.3.3 Analysis by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) 
Squalene peak was analyzed by a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 (Kyoto, Japan), equipped with 
a mass selective detector. Separations were carried out on a DB-5ms (5%-phenyl)- 
methylpolysiloxane non-polar column (30m x 0.32mm i.d.; Agilent Tech. Palo Alto, California).  
Temperatures of the injector and the detector were both set at 250oC. Temperature of the column 
was started at 80oC, increased to 320oC at 15oC/min and maintained at 320oC for 12 min. The 
split ratio was 1:50 using nitrogen as the carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30.6 cm/s at 80oC. 
All mass spectra were acquired using the electron impact (EI) mode at 0.80 kV and an ion source 
temperature of 200°C. The mass spectra were scanned in the range of m/z 30-600 at 1250 scan/s. 
 
3.3.4 Analysis by Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) 
Characterization of silica gel was performed in an FTIR spectrometer (Digilab Excalibur FTS 
3500GX, Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The optical bench included a dynamically aligned Michelson 
interferometer, a potassium bromide beam splitter, and a deuterated tri-glycine sulfate (DTGS) 
detector. Spectra were observed using Digilab Software (Version 3.3, Merlin) on an 
 21
prevent spillage. A thermocouple was inserted into the thimble and the thimble was placed inside 
the soxhlet extractor (245 mL). The less-polar lipids were extracted with hexane (350 mL), which 
was put in a 500 mL round-bottom flask and was heated. The refrigerated circulating bath was 
used with a refrigerant (ethanol), which flowed through the jacket. The hexane vapor traveled up 
the distillation arm, and flooded into the chamber housing the thimble. The condenser ensured 
that any hexane vapor condenses and drips back down into the chamber housing the thimble. The 
chamber containing the thimble slowly filled with hexane at controlled temperature (–6 to 65oC). 
At a certain controlled temperature, some compounds will dissolve in hexane. When the chamber 
was almost full, it was automatically emptied by a siphon side arm, which returns the hexane to 
the distillation flask. During each cycle, a portion of non-volatile compound dissolves in the 
hexane. After many cycles the desired compounds were concentrated in the distillation flask. The 
solution in the distillation flask was then filtered and hexane was removed to yield the hexane 
extractive. Squalene and FASE were preferentially extracted into this hexane phase, which is 
designated as the non-polar lipid fraction (NPLF). Lipids adsorbed on the silica gel were then 
extracted with ethyl acetate for 3 h at 71oC, and the extract was designated as the polar lipid 
fraction (PLF). The recovered silica gel was treated and used in another run for reusability study. 
Figure 3-4 shows the flow chart for the extraction of NPLF from SODD. 
 
3.4.2 Silica Gel Column Chromatography 
3.4.2.1 Classical silica gel column chromatography 
A silica gel column chromatography (300 mm x 45 mm i.d. glass tube) equipped with a valve 
to control the flow rate of eluent was employed in this study. Silica gel (60 g) was kept in a 
furnace at 150oC for 1 h. Next, slurry of silica gel in hexane was poured into the column 
previously half-filled with hexane. The hexane was allowed to flow slightly during packing. The 
top surface of the stationary phase was covered by cotton, and a thermo couple was put above the 
cotton. The hexane level was lowered until it was 0.5 cm above the cotton. The exit of the silica 
gel column chromatography was plugged with cotton to retain the solid. About 3 g of NPLF was 
dissolved in hexane (100 ml) and the mixture was put into the column at room temperature. The 
column was eluted with hexane at 4.06 ml/min. The first fraction, which contains mostly 
hydrocarbons, was obtained after eluted with 3.17 L hexane. The squalene-rich fraction was 
obtained after eluting with 10.96 L hexane.   
 
3.4.2.2 Modified silica gel column chromatography 
A modified version of the classical silica gel column chromatography was employed in this 
study (Fig 3.2). Silica gel (18 to 60 g) was kept in a furnace at 150oC for 1 h. Next, a slurry of 
silica gel in hexane was poured into the column that was previously half-filled with hexane. The 
exit of the column was plugged with 1 g cotton to retain the silica gel and a thermo couple was 
inserted above the cotton. The hexane was allowed to drain slightly during packing. The top 
surface of the silica gel was covered by 1 g cotton, and a thermo couple was put above the cotton. 
The hexane level was lowered until it was ca. 100 mL above the cotton at the top. NPLF (3 g) 
was put into the column at room temperature (23 °C). The column was eluted with 50 mL hexane, 
 23
Impurities in the 3rd fraction obtained from MSGCC of NPLF were extracted by using binary 
solvent at room temperature. Sample (0.5 g) was thoroughly mixed with 40 mL mixture of water 
and acetone for 15 min. The mixture was then centrifuged (7000 g) at room temperature for 15 
min. Supernatant, which contains most impurities, was discarded. FASEs were collected in the 
precipitate. This process was repeated until most impurities were removed. The final precipitate 
was collected and residual solvent was removed to obtain high purity FASEs.

3.4.3.2 Combination of solvent extraction 
Water-acetone extraction was proposed to obtain FASEs with high purity and recovery as 
shown in Figure 3-6. Impurities in the 3rd fraction obtained from modified silica gel column 
chromatography of NPLF were extracted by using binary solvent at room temperature. Sample 
(0.5 g) was thoroughly mixed with 40 mL of water and acetone (0:100 v/v) for 15 min. The 
mixture was then centrifuged (7000 g) at room temperature for 15 min. White solid in precipitate 
1 was collected. Supernatant, which contains most impurities, was thoroughly mixed with 40 mL 
mixture of water and acetone (10:90 v/v) for 15 min, then centrifuged (7000 g) at room 
temperature for 15 min. FASEs were collected in the precipitate. This process was repeated twice. 
The final precipitate was collected and designated as precipitate 2. The resulting supernatant was 
thoroughly mixed with 40 mL mixture of water and acetone (20:80 v/v) for 15 min, then 
centrifuged (7000 g) at room temperature for 15 min. This process was repeated twice on the

CHAPTER 4 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
4.1 MODIFIED SOXHLET EXTRACTION (MSE) 
SODD sample I was used and its composition is shown in Table 3-1. The objective of MSE 
is to isolate squalene and FASEs in a fraction rich with hydrocarbon (NPLF) and tocopherols and 
free phytosterols in another fraction (PLF) that is rich in FFAs and acylglycerols. 
A single-stage MSE with SODD coated on silica gel at room temperature with hexane as the 
solvent was employed in this study. The effects of silica gel to SODD mass ratio, extraction 
temperature, and reusability of silica gel on the separation were systematically investigated. 
GC chromatograms in Figure 4-1 show that after MSE, most FFAs along with tocopherols 
and free phytosterols were concentrated in the PLF. The FFAs region in the chromatogram of the 
NPLF shows interferences by minor components.   
Steroidal hydrocarbons coexisted with tocopherols and free phytosterols as shown in the 
insert in Figure 4-1. These steroidal hydrocarbons may have arisen from the oxidation of 
tocopherols and free phytosterols during soybean oil refining, and/or the enrichment of 
hydrocarbons during MSE. TLC and HT-GC analyses of the PLF showed absence of squalene. 
Significant amount of aldehydes and ketones were present, both in the NPLF and the PLF.

 27
As silica gel to SODD mass ratio decreases from 6 to 3, the recoveries of tocopherols, free 
phytosterols, FFAs, and TAGs increase from 28.75% to 48.80%, 17.61% to 20.12%, 11.71% to 
41.47%, and 2.31% to 43.42%, respectively, while the recovery of FASE increases from 64.03% 
to 97.6%. Tocopherols contents were not significantly different (p > 0.05) among all silica gel to 
SODD mass ratios studied. However, the content and recovery of FFAs and TAGs, along with the 
recovery of tocopherols and free phytosterols was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at a silica gel to 
SODD mass ratio of 3, compared to those obtained using higher silica gel to SODD mass ratio. 
A higher silica gel to SODD mass ratio yielded a higher adsorption area available per unit 
mass of SODD, which resulted in a higher number of extractions, a poorer recovery of FASEs in 
NPLF, and less NPLF obtained. This result agrees with previous observation that the presence of 
a hydroxyl group on silica gel imparts a degree of polarity to the surface, so, polar molecules 
such as water, alcohols, phenols, and amines and unsaturated hydrocarbons are adsorbed 
preferentially over nonpolar molecules such as saturated hydrocarbons (Ruthven, 1984). The 
amount of FFAs adsorbed per unit area of silica gel was found to increase in proportional to the 
surface area of silica gel (Hau and Nawar, 1985), which is again consistent with the results shown 
in Table 4-1. 
 
4.1.2 Effect of Extraction Temperature   
A lower extraction temperature is favorable because it minimizes the degradation of 
bioactive compounds in SODD. Our study shows that the number of extraction required 
achieving 100% recovery of squalene in NPLF increases from 40 to 88 cycles as extraction 
temperature decreases from 65oC to -6oC. It can be seen from Table 4-2 that the amount of NPLF 
obtained, in term of a percentage of SODD, increases with extraction temperature. While the 
contents of squalene and FASEs were significantly different (p < 0.05) at –6oC from those at 
other temperatures, the recovery of FASEs was not significantly different (p > 0.05). The 
important criterion for a successful separation is to recover most FASEs in NPLF. As can be seen 
in Table 4-2, within the temperature range studied, the recovery of FASEs varies with extraction 
temperature. An extraction temperature of –6oC was chosen in this study even though at this 
temperature the squalene content in NPLF obtained was lower than that at 3oC. Both contents and 
recoveries of tocopherols, free phytosterols, FFAs and TAGs were significantly lower (p < 0.05) 
at –6oC than those obtained at 7, 55, and 65oC.  Therefore, -6oC seems to be a better choice, 
since we prefer most tocopherols, free phytosterols, FFAs and TAGs to be concentrated in PLF.  
Adsorption is usually an exothermic process, a decrease in extraction temperature yields a 
better separation of polar and nonpolar components, as can be seen in Table 4-2. These results 
agree with previous observations that the ultimate capacity of silica gel is generally higher at low 
temperature (Ruthven, 1984). In another study, Chu et al. (2004) found that a lower temperature 
led to higher vitamin E uptake at equilibrium, indicating that vitamin E adsorption by silica is an 
exothermic process. Moreira and Baltanás (2004) have shown that separation of free phytosterols 
and tocopherols is usually performed through a fractional crystallization because free 
phytosterols tend to precipitate at low temperature. 
Our results suggest that under the following operation conditions: silica gel o SODD mass 
 29
  The effectiveness of this separation was confirmed in subsequent experiments, carried out 
under the same conditions except with different SODD compositions (Table 4-4). From results 
obtained in this study, it can be seen that modified soxhlet extraction, which is much easier to 
operate than molecular distillation, can concentrate hydrocarbons and FASEs into NPLF. This 
method is capable of eliminating tocopherols, free phytosterols, FFAs, and acylglcerols from 
SODD by 87.99 – 95.68%, 97.26 – 99.76%, 76.13 – 82.11%, and 91.03 – 97.25%, respectively.

Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm analysis was used to examine the characteristic of 
silica gels. As seen in Table 4-5, the specific surface area derived using Langmuir model is 
higher than that obtained by BET method. Since Langmuir and BET models are not based on the 
same assumptions, we would not expect to find an agreement between values determined by 
these two models. A lower BET surface area yielded a lower adsorption area available per unit 
mass of SODD, which resulted in a poorer recovery of FFAs in NPLF. This result agrees with 
previous observation that the amount of FFAs adsorbed per unit area of silica gel was found to 
decrease with decreasing surface area of silica gel (Hau and Nawar, 1985). Also, total specific 
pore volume of used silica gel dropped to 65 % of that of the initial silica gel. These results are 
not due to uncompleted removal of absorbed compounds during regeneration. No compounds 
were remaining in silica gel, as confirmed by the FTIR analysis. 
 
 31
4.2 SILICA GEL COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY 
Aliphatic, steroidal, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represent about 40-50% of NPLF. Due 
to such high content, efficient removal of these hydrocarbons and FFAs is crucial for obtaining 
high purity squalene and FASEs. Repeated MSE, solvent crystallization (hexane, acetone, acetic 
acid, methanol, and isopropanol), and solvent extraction using mixture of solvents (water-acetone, 
and water-methanol) did not result in a successful separation (data not shown). 
By subjecting NPLF to distillation at 220oC and 5 mTorr for 10 min, most FFAs, aliphatic, 
steroidal and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was concentrated in the distillate whereas most free 
phytosterols, all FASEs and acylglycerols remained in the residue fraction. The disadvantages of 
distillation are that it resulted in the degradation of FASEs and the decrease of squalene recovery. 
Squalene was not all collected in one fraction. It was found that the total amount of FFAs and free 
phytosterols increased due to FASEs degradation. To check this FASEs degradation, standard 
cholesteryl stearate (white solid at 25oC) was heated at 220oC and 5 mTorr for 10 min. The result 
showed that cholesteryl stearate was degraded to stearic acid and cholesterol as evidenced by 
HT-GC analysis and the white solid became brownish after treatment. Therefore, column 
chromatography was employed to isolate squalene and FASEs. NPLF of SODD sample III was 
used in preliminary study and its composition is shown in Table 4-4. 
 
4.2.1 Classical Silica Gel Column Chromatography 
Despite the fact that HPLC leads to better separation and analysis, classical column 
chromatography and TLC are still widely practiced because of their convenience. The successful 
use of liquid chromatography for a given problem requires the right combination of operating 
conditions: the type of column packing and mobile phase, the length and diameter of the column, 
mobile-phase flow rate, elution temperature, and sample size (Snyder and Kirkland, 1979). Most 
applications are carried out at ambient temperature. 
A classical SGCC was used to fractionate hydrocarbons from the unsaponifiable matter of 
both virgin and refined olive oil, using hexane as the eluent (Lanzόn et al., 1994).  A classical 
SGCC was also used to fractionate hydrocarbons and fatty acid steryl esters (FASEs) from the 
non polar lipid fraction (NPLF) obtained from crude rice bran oil (Gunawan et al., 2006). In 
another study, the separation of squalene from the unsaponifiable matter of olive oil deodorizer 
distillate was achieved by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), using mixture of solvent as mobile 
phase (Bondioli et al., 1993). 
The first fraction obtained from the SGCC of NPLF of SODD sample III is mainly 
comprised of aliphatic, sesquiterpene, and steroidal hydrocarbons. Squalene (95.90 % purity and 
93.09 % recovery) was obtained in the second fraction after eluting the column with 10.96 L 
hexane. The continue elution of the column with 33.13 L hexane yielded a third fraction rich in 
FASE (84.04 % purity and 63.17 % recovery). The washing fraction was collected by eluting the 
column with ethyl acetate. 
 
4.2.2 Modified Silica Gel Column Chromatography (MSGCC) 
Classical column chromatography and TLC are laborious, time consuming (Moreda et al., 
 33
Aliphatic, steroidal and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons represent about 40-50% of the NPLF of 
SODD. Due to such high content, efficient removal of these hydrocarbons is crucial for obtaining 
high purity squalene (triterpene hydrocarbon) which is the most polar hydrocarbons in the NPLF. 
In this study, we choose squalene as an indicator for successful separation of the first (aliphatic, 
steroidal and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons) and the second fraction (squalene); parameters such as 
gradient elution of mobile phase, silica gel to NPLF mass ratio, elution temperature and mobile 
phase flow rate were adjusted until high purity (> 90 %) squalene with high recovery (> 80%) 
was obtained. 
The major decision required in the design of a satisfactory separation is selection of the 
mobile phase.  Hexane was selected as the eluting solvent for the first and the second fractions 
because mixture of solvent (hexane and ethyl acetate) did not result in satisfactory separation 
(data not shown). This is because polarities of aliphatic, steroidal, sesquiterpene, and triterpene 
hydrocarbons are roughly in the same range.  
A lower silica gel to NPLF mass ratio is desirable in column chromatography, because less 
adsorbent and shorter elution time are required. However, a silica gel to NPLF mass ratio less 
than 10 did not result in successful separations (data not shown) because it was larger than the 
linear capacity of the column (Snyder and Kirkland, 1979). Therefore, the mass ratios employed 
in this study were either 10 or 20.

(D) the 3rd fraction; (E) the washing fraction. 
 
Table 4-6 shows that a lower silica gel to NPLF mass ratio results in a higher recovery of all 
hydrocarbons in the first fraction. The P-value method was applied to determine the significance 
of these differences. At a higher silica gel to NPLF mass ratio (20), the impurity (mainly squalene) 
content and recovery in the 1st fraction is significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that obtained if a 
lower silica gel to NPLF mass ratio of 10 was used. 
 35
(relative intensity: 1.09 %) and base peak at 69.05. Peaks were also observed at m/z at 149, 137, 
121, 109, 95, 81, 55, and 41. These fragmentation patterns were quite similar to those for 
squalene reported in U.S. National Bureau of Standards library (2005).  
The fractionations obtained in this study give better separation than previous study of 
Lanzόn et al. (1994) in which the unsaponifiable matter of both virgin and refined olive oil was 
fractioned by classical silica gel column chromatography with a silica gel to unsaponifiable 
matter mass ratio of 75, using hexane as eluent. The fraction containing squalene was eluted 
after aliphatic, steroidal and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, the purity of squalene was not reported 
in their study. However, judging from the chromatogram in their study, low squalene purity was 
obtained. 
 
4.2.2.3 Isolation of FASEs  
Using single solvent as mobile phase is more desirable than using mixture of solvents in column 
chromatography because of easier recovery and reuse of solvent. When pure hexane was 
employed as the eluent, it was impossible to recovery most FASEs in reasonable short time in the 
third fraction. It was found that it required 83 h to isolate FASEs with a purity of 83.06% and a 
recovery of 97.84% at 23oC and 17.32 mL/min using hexane as the mobile phase. The elution 
time can be reduced to 20 h by increasing the elution temperature (temperature in the packing 
region) to 64oC due to increasing solubility of sample in mobile phase. However, the purity of 
FASEs obtained was much lower (39.01% purity, 96.15% recovery). These results agree with 
previous observation that once squalene was completely eluted, polarity of the mobile phase must 
be increased to elute other more polar compounds (Lanzόn et al. 1994). Thus, mixture of hexane 
and ethyl acetate was employed as the eluent in order to successfully recover most FASEs in the 
third fraction in shorter time.

d Amount = (3rd fraction mass, g / NPLF mass, g) x 100. 
 
  As shown in Table 4-11, for comparable separation, both elution time and amount of 
solvent required are much less when using MSGCC as compared to classical SGCC. By 
employing MSGCC to obtain the squalene-rich fraction, the mobile phase volume and elution 
time required as fractions of those needed in classical silica gel column chromatography are 
1/73 and 1/18, respectively. To obtained the FASEs-rich fraction, the corresponding mobile 
phase volume and elution time are 1/221 and 1/23, respectively of those needed in classical 
SGCC.  
This separation was confirmed in subsequent experiments, carried out under the same 
conditions except with a NPLF that contains low percentage of squalene and FASEs (Table 4-12) 
and with a NPLF obtained from SODD sample IV (Table 4-13). Squalene content in the second 
fraction and FASEs recoveries in the third fraction in this case were not significantly different (p 
> 0.05), compared to those obtained using a NPLF with high squalene and FASEs contents. Also, 
it was found that the third fraction was richer in FFAs due to higher content of FFAs in NPLF.  
 
4.3 BINARY SOLVENT EXTRACTION 
The third fraction of the NPLF from sample IV is a yellowish solid at room temperature and 
used in this study. Analysis of this fraction showed the existence of a little squalene but absence 
 39
compared to that obtained from distillation (residue). However, the residue fraction obtained 
from distillation was a brownish solid at room temperature due to degradation of FASEs. 
Therefore, solvent extraction with mixture of water and acetone as the solvent is preferred due 
to absence of thermal degradation and also higher purity FASEs can be obtained.

CHAPTER 5 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
The development of the effective isolation/fractionation method is important for lipid 
industries. The objective of this research is to develop economically viable techniques for the 
separation and purification of squalene, fatty acid steryl esters, tocopherols and phytosterols from 
soybean oil deodorizer distillate (SODD).  
The first sub aim of the present study is to separate SODD into two fractions based on 
differences in the polarity of the constituent compounds. A modified soxhlet extraction was 
applied on SODD to obtain one fraction enriched with FASEs and squalene, while tocopherols, 
free phytosterols, TAGs, and FFAs were enriched in another fraction. Unlike classical soxhlet 
extraction, in modified soxhlet extractor, the extractor is equipped with a jacket to control the 
temperature of extraction chamber. The sample (SODD) in modified soxhlet extraction is coated 
onto silica gel The basic principle of separation in this new design can be understood in terms of 
the coating and selective desorption processes. Coating is a process that occurs when SODD 
accumulates on the surface of a silica gel, forming a thin film. Selective desorption occurs when 
some compounds in SODD that is coated on the surface of silica gel dissolve in hexane. The 
effectiveness of this separation was confirmed in subsequent experiments, carried out under the 
same conditions except with different SODD compositions (sample I, II, III and IV). From results 
obtained in this study, it can be seen that modified soxhlet extraction, which is much easier to 
operate than molecular distillation, can concentrate hydrocarbons and FASEs into NPLF. 
Moreover, it operates under atmospheric pressure and lower temperature, and requires less 
sophisticated equipment. This method is capable to recover squalene and FASEs from SODD by 
100% and 89.07 – 97.33%, respectively. Also, this method is capable of eliminating tocopherols, 
free phytosterols, FFAs, and acylglcerols from SODD by 87.99 – 95.68%, 97.26 – 99.76%, 
76.13 – 82.11%, and 91.03 – 97.25%, respectively.  
The second sub aim of this study is to evaluate the use of classical silica gel column 
chromatography during isolation of squalene and FASEs from NPLF. A new silica gel column 
chromatography was designed with the objective of greatly reducing the amount of solvent 
required to achieve the same degree of separation as the classical silica gel column 
chromatography. Unlike classical column chromatography, in this new design, glass tube was 
equipped with a jacket, a valve to control flow rate of eluent, a condenser system and a heating 
mantle. Although a heater is placed in the bottom part, a uniform temperature in the silica gel 
packing is achieved by maintaining the mobile phase volume at constant value. This design can 
be used either as soxhlet extraction or column chromatography by setting the valve. As the result, 
modified silica gel column chromatography process is feasible from economic point of view as 
compare to classical silica gel column chromatography because it significantly reduces the 
amount of solvent (< 1/73) and time required (< 1/18) to achieve the same degree of separation. 
This new design is capable to recover squalene and FASEs from NPLF by 84.53 – 96.25% 
(98.11-99.49% purity) and 93.52 – 100% (75.51 – 84.47% purity), respectively.

 is to isolate and identify aliphatic HCs contained in SODD. 
The isolation of aliphatic HCs can be achieved in two steps. Firstly, NPLF was obtained 
from SODD by a modified soxhlet extraction and secondly, the isolation of aliphatic HCs was 
achieved by conventional silica gel column chromatography (ca. 97% purity).  Identification of 
individual aliphatic HC was accomplished by IR, TLC, GC and GC-MS analyses.  
In this study, GC chromatogram of aliphatic HC showed an unresolvable complex mixture 
of aliphatic HC (UCMA). This UCMA contained only three major peaks and many minor peaks. 
TLC method showed one spot of pure aliphatic compounds group. So, later IR analysis was 
carried out and the result showed that the aliphatic HCs contained in SODD are all saturated HCs, 
which include n-alkanes, branch-, and also cyclic HCs.
