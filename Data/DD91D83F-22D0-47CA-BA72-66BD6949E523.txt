2INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
In emergency situations, a high priority must be placed on saving life. When there is an
incident, emergency services, comprising police, fire fighters and ambulance services, must
be provided at the scene as quickly as possible. This paper concerns ambulance dispatching.
In many cities, there is a statutory obligation for the ambulance service to arrive on scene
within a certain time limit. For example, the United States Emergency Medical Services Act
requires that in urban areas 95% of requests should be reached within 10 minutes, while those
in rural areas should be served within 30 minutes (see Ball and Lin, 1993). In United
Kingdom, the target set by the London Ambulance Services for immediate life-threatening
calls is 8 minutes (Thakore et al., 2002). In Japan, average time of ambulance arrival on site is
about 6 minutes. To help meet these targets, ambulance location, allocation and relocation
models are necessary. In general, location models determine the server or facility locations
where the ambulances are dispatched from; allocation models decide which vehicle to be
dispatched for a specific call; and relocation models reposition idle vehicles to cover areas
which are unprotected.
Ambulance location and relocation models were studied since 1970’s, and can be broadly
classified into deterministic models and probabilistic models (Brotcorne et al., 2003; Galvao
et al., 2005). Deterministic models are usually used in the planning stage. An early model of
this type is the location set covering model due to Toregas et al. (1971), with the objective of
minimizing the number of ambulances needed to cover all demand points. Their model
considers a set of demand points and a set of potential vehicle locations. Each demand point
represents a geographic area to which service must be provided, and it is to decide the
minimum number of locations that can cover all demand points within a specified distance
and hence response time. A shortcoming of the model is that it ignores the unavailability of
the ambulances when one is dispatched for a request. To rectify this limitation, Church and
ReVelle (1974) suggested an alternative approach. In their maximum covering location model,
the objective is to maximize the sum of demand covered. Since the number of ambulances is
limited, the model may allow some of the demand points not to be covered. To guarantee a
better service with limited resources, Gendreau et al. (1997) suggested a double standard
model. While all demand in the area concerned should be reachable within an acceptable time
or distance, a certain proportion of the area must be reachable within a higher standard. In
contrast, probabilistic models are used at the operational level. Parameters, for example travel
times, the locations of patients, the demand for and the availability of ambulances, are treated
as random variables. One of the first probabilistic models for ambulance location is due to
Daskin (1983), who maximized the expected coverage of the ambulances, each of which has a
probability of being unavailable to answer a call. ReVelle and Hogan (1989) maximized the
demand covered with a given probability.
With the designed positions and dimension of the vehicle fleets, such ambulance or
emergency management system is usually operated with a decision support tool, having two
sub-problems: an allocation problem and a redeployment problem (Gendreau et al., 2001).
The allocation problem, which is sometimes referred to as the dispatch problem, considers
4The decision variables of the model are the flows of vehicles to tasks and vehicle
repositioning to another location or idling in the same location. Movement of vehicles
involves a cost, and rewards are received if a task is served by a vehicle. New resources of
vehicles may become available over time with the work schedule of the day. For each Iki , ,
tAa and Tt , we define
iatx = the number of ambulances from location i assigned to task a at time t
ikty = the number of empty ambulances from location i repositioned to location k at time t
iat = the service time for an ambulance from i serving task a at time t
ikt = the travel time for an ambulance travelling from location i to location k at time t
iatc = the reward for assigning a vehicle from i to servicing a task a at time t
iktd = the costs of relocating a vehicle from i to k at time t
itR = the number of new ambulances becoming available at location i at time t (i.e.
schedule of workforce)
The value of iatx takes a binary form of  1,0 since we assume that only one vehicle is
needed for each task. This can be relaxed by allowing a task to call for more than one vehicle,
and in that case all vehicles must be originating from a same location. Otherwise we can
model the task as a number of sub-tasks of one vehicle.
A deterministic model
Firstly we will present a deterministic dynamic model which incorporates both current and
future demands. All demands in the first (i.e. the current) period are known, and that all
demands in future time periods are forecast. While the locations of ambulances are associated
with a set of medical centres, it is difficult to model the exact location of each forecast
demand. For modelling purpose, the potential locations of forecast demand are aggregated
into zones. The assignment of ambulances to requests and the reposition of ambulances to
other locations can be captured by an assignment model as follows

A stochastic model
A stochastic model is also introduced to handle uncertainties in forecast demand. Randomness
in the demand is introduced as probabilistic locations of a call arriving in the future. The
framework takes the recursive form so that the recourse function can be approximated in
various ways in the solution algorithm. Please refer to Wong et al. (2007) for the details.
SOLUTION METHODOLOGY
A possible approach in solving dynamic programming model is to calculate the recourse
function explicitly for each state. However, computational complexity of the presented model
is   TT JSIO  , and solving the model in practice is computational intractable. Algorithms
for an approximate solution are usually used. An algorithm using the gradient approximation
developed above is presented as follows.
Step 0. Set a maximum number of iterations N, Set 0ˆ0, Sitz and 00, Sitz . Set n = 1
and t = 0.
Step 1. Forward pass. For the current n and t, solve the allocation and relocation
problem:

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
To demonstrate the relative performance of the proposed methodology, a simulation model is
setup to test against different scenarios. We will test the model against deterministic as well as
stochastic settings of the problem. To capture the spatial manner of the ambulance dispatching,
a network is created, in which nine potential demand zones and four medical centres are
located in the network. Once there is a call to the dispatching centre, the dispatcher will assign
ambulances from one of the medical centres for the call (or reject it). Travel time on each of
the links is assumed to be one unit (5 minutes here), and therefore all potential locations are
covered by a quickest response of 5 minutes. The corners are subject to less (but acceptable)
coverage than those on the boundary or in the centre of the network. For the details of the
setting of the problem, please see Wong et al. (2007).
Deterministic runs
We first perform experiments on deterministic datasets. The dispatcher solves the whole
period problem using forecast demand which is assumed to be deterministic. The gradients
used in the adaptive algorithm are estimated from 50 training iterations. To eliminate the
variation due to randomness, the evaluation of the solution in this section is computed from an
average of 20 runs. Fig. 2 shows the total reward received in a simulation period against
different demand intensity for myopic and adaptive strategies. Since the optimal solution is
unknown to us, the reward is expressed as a percentage against the maximum possible reward
received if no requests are rejected. The maximum possible reward is about linear to the
number of requests. Both myopic and adaptive strategies reach 100%, i.e., the optimal
solution, at a number of calls of 50. As the number of requests increases, the system is
overloaded and not able to take up all the calls, and therefore the percentage of gain decreases,
in which the rate of drop for the myopic strategy is steeper than that for the adaptive strategy.
The adaptive strategy outperforms the myopic one by improving the overall efficiency. It is
shown in Fig. 3 that the adaptive algorithm can consistently service more calls compared to
myopic. This is probably due to the relocation of ambulances, which can save the travel times
in the future operations. Table 2 displays the quality of services for Urgent calls, represented
by a target of waiting period for the both strategies tested. We can roughly estimate the
capacity of the medical system as 320 calls, which is an overestimation of 40 vehicles each
taking maximum 8 tasks in 4 hours without idling. At the demand level of 300, 96.5% and
98.8% of Urgent calls can be reached within 5 minutes and 10 minutes respectively with the
adaptive strategy. These percentages are 80.9% and 96.1% with the myopic algorithm. When
the demand is increased to 600, with the adaptive strategy the percentage for urgent calls
dropped slightly to 92.9% and 97.9%, in contrast to the heavy decline to 56.1% and 66.7% for
the myopic one. This confirms the purpose of our dynamic model that suggests holding
resources for future critical instances, without sacrificing too much the benefit of the current
events.
10
the near-capacity situation, it is suggested that keeping or relocating vehicles to strategic
locations could benefit the demand in the future. We formulate the problem with the objective
of maximizing the reward gained for serving a request, showed as equivalent to minimizing
the total delay incurred. The problem is formulated in a dynamic programming context, which
sufers from the “curse of dimensionality” in applications of practical size. We propose a
dynamic adaptive algorithm for solving the problem, approximating the gradient of the
recursive subproblem in a linear form. Deterministic and stochastic settings of the problem
are experimented with.Our model provides a guideline for accepting or not a current call with
the computation of values of resources currently and in the future. Of course, rejected calls
which are lower in priority would be kept track of by the operators for possible upgrading if
needed. This model is particular useful in near-capacity conditions of dispatching, in which
the tactical locations of medical centres and fleet of ambulances are already fixed.
