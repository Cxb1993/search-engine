一、 中文摘要 
 近來無線網路已成為電腦網路技術一個相當熱門的發展趨勢，由於其不需有線傳輸媒
介的羈絆，因此已發展出的應用相當多元且具實用價值。其中一熱門的無線網路是 Mobile 
Ad-Hoc networks (MANETs)。該網路是由無線且具移動性的節點所構成，它不需固定的基
礎建設且具有自我組織、低成本的優良特性，因此有不少適合日常生活的應用在此一網路
環境中被提出。然而，由於節點具有移動性，因此網路拓樸會經常改變，導致傳統的路由
協定在此類環境中效能降低甚至無法適用。近來車用行動通訊網路（Vehicular Ad-Hoc 
Networks, VANETs）即是 MANETs 網路的一種，較之前者更為熱門，但因節點移動速度更
快，因此網路拓樸改變更為劇烈，因此，設計符合該類網路之路由協定就顯得相當迫切。
在此一研究中，我們提出一針對 VANETs 網路環境之路由協定，結合了經濟學的最佳獲利
模型（Kelly formula）來克服此類網路會遇到的間歇性連結路由問題。我們亦利用網路模擬
器 NS-2 進行了實驗模擬來評估所提出路由方法之效能，結果顯示我們所提出的方法大幅改
進了傳統之路由方法在封包傳遞率之結果，而在平均點對點延遲上亦是在容忍範圍之內。 
 
二、英文摘要  
Recently, wireless networks have become one of the major development trends in computer 
network technology. Due to no longer needing the wired transmission medium, applications have 
thus diversified. One such growing field of wireless networks is the Mobile ad-hoc network 
(MANET). A MANET consists of mobile hosts (such as portable laptops, vehicles, …, etc.), and 
no fixed infrastructure is required. MANETs provide ease of self-configuration and can extend 
coverage at a low cost. Numerous applications have therefore been proposed under this network 
environment for daily life use. Since MANETs nodes are capable of moving, MANET network 
topology changes frequently. Thus the traditional routing protocols fail to fit such an environment. 
Recently, a special type of MANET called a Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET), which 
consists of moving vehicles, are increasing popular due to its useful and diverse applications. In 
this report, we propose an efficient routing protocol for VANETs, which integrates the 
mathematical model of profit optimization (the KELLY formula) from the field of Economics to 
cope with the routing problem caused by node mobility. Some numerical simulations have been 
conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using the network simulator NS-2. 
The results show that our proposed method outperforms conventional routing protocols in packet 
delivery ratio comparisons; and the average end-to-end delays are within a tolerable range.

2.2 The Kelly formula for profit optimization
In the field of economics, many profit optimization models have been developed by mathe-
maticians and economists for simulating real world human economic activity. These models
can be guidelines for investing to obtain the maximum gain. These mathematical models are
both theoretical and practical. Among these models, the KELLY formula [4] is one of the sim-
ple and practical profit optimization models, which was enhanced from the method proposed
in the Bell System Technical Journal by J.L. Kelly. The Kelly formula arose from the work
of John Kelly at AT&T’s Bell Labs in 1956. The original version aims to deal with the signal
noise in long-distance telephone transmissions, while the later revised version was designed
to aim at profit optimization; thus it has diverse applications in many fields. It can be applied
to long term investment for gaining a stable reward rate and avoid being broke like a gambler.
In this paper, we apply the Kelly formula in the design of a routing protocol to solve the rout-
ing problem caused by nodes mobility in VANETs. In the following, we take a horse racing
betting plan as an example [5] to illustrate the usage of the Kelly formula.
Now assume a gambler bets on a horse race. Let v1, v2, . . ., vk be the horses in the race
and the gamblers betting budget be B. Generally, the gambler will firstly try to collect helpful
history information related to each horse for making the best decision for distributing budget
B among the k horses. Each horse vi ∈ {v1, v2, . . . , vk} is associated with the following two
parameters related to the information,
• Odds (RviE ):
This parameter is set by the banker and will be announced before the race starts. Gener-
ally, if a horse has a higher chance of winning or if the total money bet on it by gamblers
is large, then the odds value with respect to this horse will tend to be small. On the con-
trary, the odds value will be set to be large. The odds value denotes how the banker will
pay the winner if the betting horse wins the race. For example, assume RviE = 8. In the
case of one betting $100 on horse vi and it eventually wins, then the total reward is $800
($100 × 8, the win) +$100 (the bet) = $900. Certainly, if the horse vi loses, then the
$100 will be lost.
2
The PORKF routing algorithm is composed of the following three stages: the Betting
stage, the Racing simulation stage, and the Message relaying stage. Detailed descriptions
of each of the stages are as follows.
1. The Betting stage
Since the profit optimization for the horse racing example and the message relaying in
VANETs are intrinsically different, the key parameters for the Kelly formula need to be
reformulated to fit the VANET environment. In the following, we firstly introduce the
computation method for each of the following parameters in the VANET environment,
the win probability (P viwin (0 ≤ i ≤ k)) and the odd value (RviE (0 ≤ i ≤ k)).
(a) The win probability (P viwin)
The value P viwin represents the probability of a message M in node v0 successfully
arriving at the destination if node v0 relays this message through neighbor vi ∈ N .
In order to meet this objective, we determine the P viwin value by synthesizing the
area determination between the trajectories of nodes vi and the destination vd, and
the position prediction for node movement. Assume that node v0 is currently car-
rying a message M and trying to forward it to the destination vd. Let the neighbor
node set of v0 be N . For each neighbor node vi ∈ N , we can obtain its current
position (Xvi,0, Yvi,0) and moving velocity (vxi,0, vyi,0) at time t = 0 by GPS de-
vice or some position determination algorithms. We use (Xvd,0, Yvd,0) to denote
the destination position and moving velocity (vxd,0, vyd,0) at time t = 0. Note that
the destination can be a fixed point or a moving object. In the case of it being
stationary at a fixed location, then (vxd,0, vyd,0) = (0, 0). The moving trajectories
for both nodes vi and vd within t¯ seconds are illustrated in Figure 2. Obviously,
the position of node vi at each time t ∈ [0, t¯] can be predicted according to the
following equation,
{
Xvi,t = Xvi,0 + vxi,0 × t
Yvi,t = Yvi,0 + vyi,0 × t
(3)
Similarly, the positions of destination vd (Xvd,t, Yvd,t) at time t ∈ [0, t¯] can also be
predicted according to Equation (3). Now the area (A(vi, vd, t¯)) between the two
trajectories can be approximated by summing the distances (d(vi, vd, t)) between
nodes vi and vd from time t = 0 to t = t¯. That is,
A(vi, vd, t¯) =
t¯∑
t=0
d(vi, vd, t)
=
t¯∑
t=0
√
(Xvi,t −Xvd,t)
2 + (Yvi,t − Yvd,t)
2 (4)
Generally, if the size of the area between the two trajectories (A(vi, vd, t¯)) is small,
then the chance of two nodes being close to each other in the near future will be in-
creased; consequently the chance of the message being successful received by the
destination will also increase if we relaying the message through node vi. On the
contrary, the chance of the message being successfully received by the destination
will be decreased. Thus we use Equation (5) to estimate the win probability P viwin,
where  represents a very small value and is used to avoid the probability value
becoming 0 when the size of the area is equal to the biggest value among others.
4
neighbor node v∗ ∈ N wins the race. For the winning node v∗ that is associated with
the bet value (bv∗) and the odds value Rv∗E , respectively, the new reward value wv∗ with
respect to node v∗ can then be determined by wv∗ = bv∗ · (Rv
∗
E + 1). For the other
neighboring node vi ∈ N − v∗ that loses the race, the resulting new reward value wvi
will shrink by multiplying a shrinking parameter sk(0 < sk < 1); thus, wvi = bvi × sk.
3. The Message relaying stage
After performing the previous two stages, the new reward value wvi for each neighbor
vi ∈ N is obtained. Then the relaying decision by node v0 for determining whether to
relay the message M to neighbor vi ∈ N is based on whether or not the reward value
wvi is greater than a given threshold wthreshold. That is, if wvi ≥ wthreshold then it will
relay this message to node vi and the corresponding new weight value associated with
the replicated message is set to be the reward value wvi ; otherwise, the PORKF will
cancel the message relaying to node vi. Similarly, when a neighboring node vi receives
the replicated message M associated with a new weight value wvi , it will then repeat
the above three stages of the PORKF and perform the routing decision on its respective
neighboring node set.
The complete routing algorithm of the PORKF is summarized in Figure 3.
4 Simulation results
In order to evaluate the performance of the packet delivery ratio and the average end-to-end
delay of our proposed routing algorithm, some experiments using the network simulator NS-2
[6] were performed to compare the PORKF with some traditional routing algorithms, which
include AODV [1], DSR [2], and AOMDV [3].
4.1 The simulation environment and parameter setup
Two simulations were carried out for the performance evaluation. Simulation 1 was to inves-
tigate the results of the performance comparisons as the number of nodes varied. In addition,
we also investigated the performance comparisons as the moving velocity of nodes varied
under a given number of nodes in simulation 2. For simulation 1, we varied the number of
nodes from n = 50, 100, 150, and 200. The moving velocity of each node was randomly
depicted within the interval [8, 19.5] m/s, and the relocating behavior of each node used the
random way-point mobility model to move within a simulation area of 3000m× 3000m. The
transmission range of each node was set to 250m. Meanwhile, the initial weight value with
respect to each message in the PORKF was set to 100 and the threshold was set to 20 (i.e.,
wthreshold = 20). For simulation 2, the number of nodes in the network was set to 50, and then
we varied the moving velocity of nodes by 5m/s, 10m/s, 15m/s, 20m/s, and 25m/s.
The evaluating parameters of the packet delivery ratio and the average end-to-end delay
are stated as follows. The packet delivery ratio (r) is defined as the total number of packets
successfully received by destination (nrx) divided by the total number of packets sent from the
source node (ntx). That is,
Packet delivery ratio(r) = nrx
ntx
(8)

Figure 4: Packet delivery ratio comparisons for the proposed algorithm against the other con-
ventional routing methods in simulation 1.
Figure 5: Average end-to-end delay comparisons for the proposed algorithm against the other
conventional routing methods in simulation 1.
Note that, the higher (lower) packet delivery ratio means the more (less) reliable of the
routing method is. For the other evaluating parameters, the average end-to-end delay (dAvg) is
defined as the summation of the end-to-end delay of each successfully received packet divides
by the total numbed of successfully received packets. Note that the end-to-end delay between
the source node and the destination node includes the routing processing time, the MAC layer
processing time, transmission time, propagation time, etc. Thus, the easiest way to obtain the
end-to-end delay is to let it be the value of the time of the packet received (trx) less the time
of the packet transmitted (ttx). The average end-to-end delay is as follows:
Average end-to-end delay(dAvg) =
∑
each received packet(trx − ttx)
nrx
(9)
4.2 The numerical results
Figures 4 and 5 show the packet delivery ratio comparisons and the average end-to-end de-
lay comparisons for our proposed routing algorithm PORKF against the conventional routing
methods as the number of nodes varies under the environment setup of simulation 1. In Fig-
ure 4, clearly, the packet delivery ratios increased as the number of nodes increased for any
8
comparison performance is stable and the values fall within a tolerable range in both of the
simulation environments.
5 Conclusion
In this report, we apply and integrate a mathematical model of profit optimization from the
field of Economics called the KELLY formula into VANET routing protocol design. The sim-
ulation results show that our proposed routing method, PORKF, outperforms other compared
routing protocols in packet delivery ratio, and the average end-to-end delay is within a toler-
able range. In the near future, we will try to design VANET routing algorithms using other
profit optimization methods from the field of economics to enhance routing performance.

1Mobile sink movement scheduling for network
lifetime optimization in wireless sensor networks
Chu-Fu Wang and Tsung-Heng Chen
Abstract—In recent years, due to the improvement of micro-
fabrication and semiconductor technology, the designed sensor nodes
of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have more processing power
and are of a smaller size. This has become a impetus for more
practical applications being developed in WSNs. However, since the
battery power of a sensor node is limited, it ultimately could not avoid
the problem of battery power depletion. A malfunctioning sensor
node might greatly limit the WSN’s performance of the designated
task. Therefore, how to design a scheme to manage the consumption
of the battery power of sensor nodes to extend the network lifetime
has become a crucial issue. Generally, the sensor nodes near the
sink will perform more rounds of message relaying than others, and
then they will quickly deplete their battery power which is known
to be the hot spot problem. A sink that is capable of moving can
alleviate this problem. In this paper, we formulate a network lifetime
optimization problem for the movement scheduling of a mobile sink.
A Honey-Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm is proposed
to determine a near optimal solution. The experimental results show
that the proposed HBMO algorithm can effectively arrange the mobile
sink’s movement scheduling to balance the power consumption of
each node; consequently the network lifetime of a WSN can then be
prolonged to the greatest extent.
Keywords—Honey-bee mating optimization, mobile sink, wireless
sensor network
I. INTRODUCTION
A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of a large
number of sensor nodes which are capable of environmental
monitoring and short-range communication. Due to the WSNs
having a broad range of applications, much attention from
researchers has been focussed on continually developing more
advanced technologies and more innovative applications [1-
3]. Since a sensor node is assembled with limited battery
power, after performing several rounds of sensing and message
relaying, some of them will deplete their battery power and
consequently the designated monitoring task of the WSN will
be foiled. Traditionally, the sensor nodes and the sink are both
stationary, with the sensor nodes near the sink performing
more frequent message relaying compared to other sensor
nodes. These sensor nodes will thus quickly drain out their
battery power, which is known to be the hot spot problem.
For the example in Fig. 1, since the sensor node v6 has to
relay every reported message from other sensor nodes to the
sink, it is a hot spot of the WSN.
Recently, researchers [4-8] have proposed schemes of mo-
bile sinks for relieving the hot spot problem. A mobile sink can

Fig. 1. An example illustrating the hot spot problem in a WSN
dynamically relocate its position when nearby sensor nodes’
remaining battery power is low. It can balance the battery
power consumption of each sensor node and thus prolong
the network lifetime. Among these studies, L. Sun et. al.
[7] proposed an energy-efficient half-quadrant-based moving
strategy for mobile sinks to gather sensing information. The
data gathering method consists of the following three steps.
Firstly, the mobile sink disseminates its position to each sensor
node in the WSN. Then the receiving sensor node will report
its related information, such as its remaining energy, position,
etc., to the sink. Based on this information, the sink can then
adopt the half-quadrant-based moving strategy to determine
whether or not the relocation has to be made and where the
next position is for the mobile sink to move to. The proposed
method partitions the monitoring region centered at the sink
into 8 half-quadrants. The half-quadrants with the greatest total
remaining energy of sensor nodes among this sector will be
the moving target, called the MoveDest sector. A sensor node
with only a little battery energy is called a quasi-Hotspot.
A half-quadrant which contains no quasi-Hotspot is called a
clean sector. In contrast, the half-quadrant is called a miry
sector. The exactly moving direction and the next relocating
position will depend on the possible combination cases of
The energy consumed at node v9 is 20 units of battery power
for message transmitting. Since nodes v0 and v6 perform
both tasks of message receiving and transmitting, the total
energy consumed is 30 units of battery power. The remaining
battery power of each node after performing the first round
of event reporting is shown in Fig. 4(b). According to the
sink movement scheduling of the second and the third rounds,
the sinks are both at node v4 and the positions of the event
occurrence are at v5 and v3, respectively. The resulting WSNs
after performing these two event reporting tasks are shown
in Fig.s 4(c) and 4(d), respectively. By continuing the above
operations round by round, there will eventually be a node
which firstly drains out its battery power and then the WSN
will die. In the case of the WSN dying while executing the
event reporting at the t-th time period, then the network
lifetime of the WSN is t with respect to the movement
schedule S, and we use L(S) to denote its network lifetime;
that is L(S) = t.
Note that, given a mobile sink’s movement schedule and a
routing scheme, the above method uses a randomly generated
positions sequence of abnormal event occurrence (see Fig.
3) to determine the network lifetime, for which it might
be biased due to the Stochastic behavior of the occurrence.
There is another method to estimate the network lifetime
using an expectative approach, which assumes the abnormal
event occurring near each node vi with a probability Pi (for
simplicity, one may use the uniform probability function)
during each round to compute the energy consumption of
each node, and then the network lifetime. In the performance
evaluations of this paper, we used both approaches to compute
the network lifetime of the WSN.
Given a communication graph G = (V,E) of a WSN
and a routing scheme P , the network optimization prob-
lem called the Optimization of the Mobile Sink Movement
Schedule (OMSMS) aims at finding the optimum scheduling
S∗ that maximizes the network lifetime; that is, L(S∗)=max
{L(S)|for every possible movement schedule S}.
III. THE SOLUTION METHOD
In order to obtain a long-lived schedule for mobile sink relo-
cation within the monitored region, we propose the application
of a Honey Bee Mating Optimization (HBMO) algorithm to
solve the OMSMS problem. An HBMO is a swarm-based
approach for solving the optimization problem, which simu-
lates the bees’ breeding behaviors. It typically consists of the
Queen, Drones, Workers, and Broods. The Queen represents
the best solution found so far. There are three parameters
associated with the Queen, namely, the initial flying speed,
the terminated flying speed, and a spermatheca, which contains
the chromosomes from Drones ready for mating. The Drones
correspond to a solution set to provide gene variability for
breeding the next generation with the Queen.
The mating flight for the Queen and Drones is one of the
major processes in HBMO for global searching to generate the
next generation and also to refine the solution corresponding
to the Queen. During the mating flight, some Drones will
be chosen according to a probability function to mate with
Fig. 5. An illustration of the HBMO algorithm [9]
the Queen (see Fig. 5). The chosen Drones will put their
chromosomes (the solutions) into the Queen’s spermatheca.
In the case of the spermatheca being full or the mating
flight speed falling below the terminated flight speed, then
the mating flight process ends and the Queen will fly back to
the honeycomb to breed their colony. In the colony breeding
process, the chromosome of the Queen and the chromosomes
being stored in the spermatheca will mate using the Haploid
crossover to breed the colony (that is, the next generation of
solutions). The collection of the colony is called the Broods.
Then, the Workers (the process of solutions refinement) will be
used to refine each of the new Broods (see the lower left of Fig.
5). In the case of the fitness value of the refined Brood being
better than that of the Queen, then the Queen will be replaced
by the better solution. On the contrary, the breeding Broods
will be destroyed. Repeat the above mating flight process,
the colony breeding process (using Haploid-Crossover), and
the refinement Workers process until the number of mating
flights exceeds a predetermined value, then the algorithm is
terminated.
Over the last decade, the HBMO algorithm has been applied
to solve resource allocation problems, clustering problems,
market segmentation, location routing problems, etc. [10-
14]. In the following, we will present our proposed HBMO
algorithm in detail based on the above framework.
A. The encoding scheme of solutions and the initialization
process
The solution (mobile sink’s movement schedule) for the
OMSMS problem can be represented by a string of node IDs,
ranging from 0 to n − 1, where n denotes the number of
nodes in the WSN (see the example in Fig. 3). The length of
a solution string is set to be lmax. Note that, lmax must be
set to be greater than the maximum possible network lifetime
during the execution of the algorithm. Let the population size
of Drones be k. Initially, we randomly generated k solution
strings with length lmax to be the first generation of Drones
and we denote it set D. Given a routing scheme for message
transmission from each node to the sink, since the sink may
move to the position near any node in the WSN, the routing
scheme is the collection of all-pair routing paths between any
G = (V,E) be the corresponding communication graph
of the WSN, and let c(vi) denote the remaining battery
capacity for node vi ∈ V . Given the routing scheme in G
for message reporting, the expectative value of the battery
consumed for node vi ∈ V as the mobile sink located near
the node vj ∈ V at each round can be easily determined.
And we denote it by Evjcomsump(vi). In the case of the
mobile sink being located near node vj , then we can use the
above expectative value of energy consumed to determine the
minimum remaining battery energy among each node in V ;
that is, minvi∈V {c(vi) − E
vj
consump(vi)}. For each possible
case of the mobile sink’s location vj ∈ V , the mobile sink’s
location v∗ ∈ V with the maximum value among the above
minimum remaining battery energy will be selected as the
next moving location for the mobile sink. Then, decrease the
battery energy for each node vi ∈ V (c(vi)) by the value
c(vi)−E
v∗
consump(vi); that is, let c(vi) = c(vi)−Ev
∗
consump(vi).
By continuing the same process, each location for the mobile
sink to move to can be determined and a movement schedule
will then be obtained. On the other hand, the random algorithm
generates the movement schedule in a random fashion. The
purpose of the Stationary approach is to let the sink stay at a
fixed position (say, the bottom left corner of the monitoring
region), which is equivalent to the case of a stationary sink.
A. The simulation environment and parameters setup
We varied the number of nodes from n = 50, 100, 150,
. . ., 350. The initial battery energy was set to be 0.5J for all
nodes. The parameter settings for our proposed HBMO are
summarized in Table 1.

HBMO algorithm.
The number of mating flights 100
The size of the spermatheca (Spermathecasize) 20
The number of Drones 150
The initial flight speed of the Queen 1.0
The terminated flight speed of the Queen 0.05
Flight speed decreasing factor (α) 0.9
In each of the simulation cases, the nodes were randomly
distributed within the monitoring region to form a WSN. There
were totally 1, 400 simulation instances generated for each of
case. Then, each of the algorithms was performed on the above
generated instances and the average network lifetime values
for each algorithm were computed.
B. The numerical results
Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 shows the network lifetime (number
of transmission rounds) comparison for the sink’s movement
schedule generated by each of the algorithms as the number of
nodes varies, for which the network lifetime estimated meth-
ods used the abnormal event detected nodes generated by the
random approach and the expectative approach, respectively.
Clearly, the generated movement schedulings by the Random
approach, the Greedy approach, and the proposed HBMO
algorithm performed better than the generated movement
scheduling by the Stationary approach, which demonstrates

that the moveable sink can greatly alleviate the hot spot prob-
lem. In addition, our proposed HBMO algorithm outperformed
the other algorithms.
On the other hand, we also made simulations for enhancing
the simulation time of the proposed HBMO algorithm for the
process of the refinement of Workers. As discussed in the solu-
tion method, the Workers will enhance the fitness value of each
of the Broods, which is time-consuming during the process of
the entire algorithm. Therefore, we made simulations of the
case of only a certain percentage of the Broods (25% and 75%)
being enhanced by the Workers to conserve the computation
time in the cases of n = 150, n = 200, and n = 250. As
shown in Fig.s 9-11(a) the network lifetime of 25% and 75% of
the Broods improved by Workers had only a slight difference,
but the conserved computation time was significant (see Fig.s
9-11(b)). Therefore, in the case of the computation time being
a vital consideration, then the percentage of the Broods being
refined by the Workers can be set to be 75% in the HBMO
algorithm to reduce the computation time.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a Honey-bee optimization algo-
rithm for the computation of proper mobile sink moving sched-
ule. The simulation results show that our proposed method
provides a good approach for effectively arranging mobile sink

技術說明
(中文) 由於車輛節點具有高速移動性，因此VANET網路之拓樸變動相當頻繁。導致傳統
路由協定不適合在此一環境之中使用。而針對克服該網路會產生的間歇性連結路
由問題來設計合適之路由方法則成為一非常重要的議題。本技術主要以結合經濟
學的最佳獲利模型（Kelly formula）作為演算法則設計之基礎進而提出一VANET
網路之有效率之路由方法。我們亦利用網路模擬器NS-2進行了實驗模擬來評估所
提出路由方法之效能，結果顯示我們所提出的方法大幅改進了傳統之路由方法在
封包傳遞率之結果，而在平均點對點延遲上亦是在容忍範圍之內。
(英文) Since vehicular nodes are capable of moving, VANETs network topology changes 
frequently. Thus the traditional routing protocols fail to fit such an environment. The 
routing design to cope with the intermittent connected routing problem becomes an 
important issue for VANETs. In this technology, we proposed an efficient routing 
protocol for VANETs, which integrates the mathematical model of profit optimization 
(the KELLY formula) from the field of Economics with the routing design. Some 
numerical simulations have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed 
method using the network simulator NS-2. The results show that this technology 
outperforms conventional routing protocols in packet delivery ratio comparisons; and the 
average end-to-end delays are within a tolerable range.
