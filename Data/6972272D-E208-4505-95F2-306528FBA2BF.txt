2. Abstract 
We propose a radiometric method based on 
measurement of the radioactivity of the naturally 
occurring radionuclides 228Ra and 228Th and the 
derived 228Th/228Ra ratios in plant samples to 
estimate plant age and the corresponding 
nutritional conditions in a field-growing fern, 
Dicranopteris linearis.  Plant age (tissue age) 
was associated with the 228Th/228Ra ratio in fronds, 
which implies the accumulation time of immobile 
elements in the plant tissue or the life span of the 
fronds. Results indicated that the accumulation of 
alkaline earth elements in D. linearis is relatively 
constant with increased age, while the K 
concentration is reversed with age because of 
translocation among plant tissues.  Estimation of 
dating uncertainty based on measurement 
conditions revealed that the radiometric technique 
can be applied to trace chronosequential changes 
of elemental concentrations and environmental 
pollutants in plants with ages of less than 10∼15 
years.

3. Introduction 
The uptake of essential elements and 
environmental pollutants by plants is subjected 
to the following factors, among others: plant 
species, soil properties, chemical behavior and 
plant age. Practically, these factors can be 
combined and represented as the soil-to-plant 
transfer factor (TF), by which the movement of 
an element from the nonliving to the living 
compartments of the biosphere is described 
(Chojnacka et al., 2005; Kabata-Pendias, 2004; 
Sheppard, 1985; Wenzel and Jockwer, 1999).  
Usually, the TF is widely varied among plants 
of the same species, even those growing at the 
same site. Moreover, the influence of plant age 
on the TF might be quite unpredictable, and the 
chronosequence variation can not be predicted 
properly.  Accumulation of an element, or a 
pollutant, with time in plants can be easily 
clarified by a hydroponic or pot experiment 
with designed treatments and period (Kumar et 
al., 1995; Salt et al., 2004; Salt et al., 997; Zhu 
et al.,2002). However, monitoring the 
chronosequential uptake or translocation of 
elements in wild plants is difficult because of 
the uncertainty about their ages and the 
abovementioned factors. To monitor the change 
in elements at different plant growth stages, 
some studies separated plant samples into 
classes of different ages. Those studies relied on 
field observation and seasonal sampling and 
sometimes required methodologies with 
 -3-
turn decays through a series of alpha emissions.  
A schematic diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1 to 
describe the changes of 228Ra and 228Th with 
time in a plant tissue, in which the immobile 
elements are accumulated in the growing 
period. 
For field-growing D. linearis, 228Ra is 
expected to be continuously accumulated at a 
constant rate (R, in units of becquerels per 
kilogram per year in plant tissue such as fronds).  
This linear relationship will be verified from the 
experimental approach and will be discussed in 
the following sections.  The accumulation and 
subsequent decay of 228Ra in D. linearis tissues 
with time (t) in terms of atom number (N1) is 
expressed as

1 NR
dt
dN ×λ−λ= , (1) 
where λ1 is the decay constant of 228Ra, 
0.121 y-1 (Reus and Westmeier, 1983).  The 
plant tissues, or fronds, beginning with the 
blooming of sprouts, are assumed to contain no 
228Ra in the initial growing condition. Solving 
Eq.(1) gives

where A1(t)= λ1×N1(t) represents the 
radioactivity of 228Ra (Bq⋅kg-1). 
Thorium in the liquid phase of soils, 
described by distribution coefficient (kd), is 
relatively insoluble (Sheppard, 1985). The 
amounts of 228Th both directly taken up from 
soil and produced as a decay product of 232Th 
inside plants are negligible relative to those of  
228Ra (Linsalata, 1994; Hill, 1962; Osburn, 
1965).  Therefore, almost all 228Th (N2) is 
formed through the decay of 228Ra inside plants, 
expressed as

The activity ratio of 228Th/228Ra, or 
(A2/A1)t , is directly related to time (t), and plant 
age can be simply determined by measuring the 
radioactivity of 228Ra and 228Th in plant samples, 
regardless of the accumulation rate of 228Ra (R). 
4.2. Experimental procedure 
The sampling locality was in an area of 
4000 m2 (200 L ? 20 W) at Shihling, the 
footslopes of the Yangmingshan National Park 
in suburban Taipei.  The soils are Inceptisols 
 -5-
10 years), the sensitivity becomes poor, as 
described by differentiating Eq. (8) and as 
shown in Fig.2(b).  Dating uncertainty, defined 
by Eq. (12), is evaluated with respect to plant 
species, plant age, and measurement conditions 
in the following sections.  The 228Ra and 226Ra 
contents in the fresh sample are plotted against 
the plant age, which is calculated from the 
228Th/228Ra ratio by Eq. (8), as illustrated in 
Fig.3.  Note that t does not exceed one year for 
the fresh samples, except for partially dead 
samples.  The longest life span, or the 
accumulation time, of the immobile elements in 
the D. linearis fronds is approximately one year, 
which corresponds to a 228Th/228Ra ratio of 
0.1643.  During growth, the 228Ra 
concentration linearly increased with time; the 
accumulation rates are estimated to be 219.6 
Bq⋅kg-1⋅y-1.  Another Ra isotope 226Ra was 
simultaneously measured and also showed a 
linear accumulation.  This linear accumulation 
also supports the aforementioned assumption 
that the uptake rate of Ra is virtually constant 
throughout the life span of D. linearis until 
death.  
5.2 Uptake of calcium and other alkaline earth 
elements 
Most of the functions of Ca as a structural 
component of macromolecules are related to its 
capacity of coordination, predominantly in cell 
walls and at the plasma membrane.  For 
instance, Ca is found as the cementing 
substance Ca-pectate of the cell wall or 
sequestered as Ca-oxalate and Ca-carbonate in 
vacuoles.  Calcium is not redistributed to 
younger tissues and is considered as one of the 
most immobile of the essential elements 
(Hanson, 1984; Kirkby and Pilbeam, 1984).  In 
general, the level of alkaline earth elements is 
closely associated with that of Ca in plants 
(Million et al., 1994; Wyttenbach et al., 1995b).  
The soil-to-plant ratios of Ra, Th and La are 
highly associated with Ca concentration in some 
vegetables (Linsalata et al., 1989).  Therefore, 
these elements are expected to increase in 
concentration during growth.  The levels of Ca, 
strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) in the growing 
tissues of D. linearis were associated with the 
corresponding 228Th/228Ra ratio or age, as 
illustrated in Fig. 4, which indicates that these 
elements almost linearly accumulated during 
growth, the uptake being in the order of Ca > Ba 
> Sr > Ra.  The Ca accumulation rate (dCCa/dt), 
defined as the concentration increment in a time 
interval, can be estimated at 1421.8 mg⋅kg-1⋅y-1 
during growth.  The dCCa/dt, in unit 
mg⋅kg-1⋅y-1, expresses the increased 
concentration of Ca in a time interval relative to 
the initial concentration.  The dCCa/dt can be 
referred to as the “relative growth rate” or “net 
influx rate” (Gardner et al., 1985; Zhu, 2001; 
Zhu et al., 2002); such rates which are 
commonly used for quantitatively describing 
plant growth and are defined as the dry weight 
or elemental concentration increase in a time 
interval in relation to the initial weight 
concentration. 
5.3 Variations in potassium concentration with 
age 
Potassium is essential to plants but is not a 
part of any known plant constituent (Gardner et 
al., 1985).  Potassium concentration (CK) is 
usually associated with growth of plant tissues: 
young parts usually contain a higher 
concentration, and the element translocates to 
newly growing parts during aging.  The 
dynamics of CK in plant tissues during growth 
could be considered a reverse indicator of age.  
 -7-
228Th/228Ra ratio indicates that the life span of 
fresh fronds is approximately one year, which is 
in agreement with field observations.  In this 
study,  228Ra accumulation in growing D. 
linearis showed linearity with time, which 
validated the mathematical prediction.  For 
non-linear accumulation in some plants, 
involving exponential or logarithmic cases, the 
ratio should be correlated with time according 
to the specific uptake model, or pattern of 
growth. 
The proposed method associated plant age 
with the 228Th/228Ra ratio, explicitly indicating 
the nutritional condition, translocation and other 
time-dependent variations related to plant 
growth, which can be practical for tracing a 
chronosequence of elemental and pollutant 
concentrations in plants.
