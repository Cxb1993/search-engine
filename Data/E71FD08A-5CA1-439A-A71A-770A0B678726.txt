英文摘要 
Keywords: granular avalanche, debris avalanche, arbitrary topography, unified coordinate 
system, shock formation, free-moving boundary 
 
Based on the “Shallow water models over arbitrary Topography”, proposed by Bouchut and 
Dickenberg [2004], we propose to derive a one phase granular avalanche model, in which the 
flows are down a three-dimensional topographic surface of shallow curvature. With a similar 
concept of the Unified Coordinate System, an erodible model will be derived, that the 
coordinate automatically coincides with the moving bed. For the numerical models, we propose 
to introduce the Unified Coordinates for deriving a modified equation system, in which the 
coordinates (, , ) are material functions of the pseudo-particles, that computational cells are 
automatically generated, move and deform with the pseudo-particles. With the combination of 
the Godunov/MUSCL technique and Unified Coordinate it becomes feasible to develop a 
numerical model with shock-capturing and describing free-moving boundary features.

In order to proposed a first approach of an alternative method in modeling geophysical mass 
flows over moving basal surface and reduce the complexity of the multiphase approach as well as 
the debate on the interaction between the constituents or the degree of turbulent intensity, we 
restrict it to a single phase description with balances of mass and linear momentum only. Similar 
approaches are not scarce and may date back to the pioneering work of Grigorian and Ostroumov 
in 1977 and several applications can be found, e.g. Souvilla & Bartelt (2002) or Souvilla et al. 
(2007). In addition, Eglit & Demidov (2005) have reviewed most formulae of entrainment in 
literature and categorized them into three different versions, that the erosion rate might be 
proportional to the flow velocity, height or the square of the flow velocity (kinetic energy), 
respectively. But they mostly focus on the entrainment process for snow avalanches. For thin 
surface flows over sand piles, Bouchaud et al. (1994) proposed a continuum description of the 
dynamics, but only the mass balance was taken into account. Boutreux et al. (1998) extended this 
approach to a model for thick granular avalanches, where the deposition rate is assumed to be 
dependent on some constant vup, comparable to the flow velocity, instead of the flow thickness 
as in Bouchaud et al. (1994). For rockfall avalanches, Pitman et al. (2003) proposed a model of 
erosive-only bed, where the amount of eroded material increases monotonically with the bed 
shear stress when the stress is above a postulated threshold. Naaim et al. (2003) determined the 
erosion/deposition rate by the balance of the force at the base, where a nonlinear constitutive law 
of Pouliquen (1999) is applied and the empirical critical angles θmin, θmax as well as the 
corresponding threshold depth hstop(θ) are included. In this paper we follow the proposal of Tai 
& Kuo (2008), a modification of the BCRE model, for the erosion/deposition rate. It will be 
demonstrated that this most simplistic approach delivers already satisfactory results under the 
limited conditions for which the equations are meaningful.

where reqf  is the regularization function, e  is an empirical rate factor and H(•) is the 
Heaviside step function. The function reqf  depends on the component of velocity, *q , parallel

     ththreqreq veevff  *tanh15.0,*, qq  , (23)
where e  determines the steepness of the transition. Following Tai and Kuo (2008) the relation

MME 

, (24)
where   is the ratio of the density,  , of the flowing layer to the density,  , of the bottom. 
Once the volume loss rate M is determined, the normal component of the coordinate velocity Q  
is selected to be equal to the value of the deposition rate E, i.e., Q = E, and the tangential 
components, Q  and Q , are selected to be zero, so that the ξ-surface (ζ=0) always coincides 
with the topographic surface.  
 This model offers several advantages over the existing models of the Savage-Hutter (1989) 
type, and benefit significantly for numerical simulations, especially when the deposition/erosion 
processes are non-negligible. First, the field equations are the conservation laws of the Cartesian 
components written in the temporally varying curvilinear coordinate system, where the 
instantaneous local curvature of the basal topography is systematically included. This simplifies 
the description of flows over non-uniformly curved beds of general types and, computation-wise, 
the mesh grids automatically fit the moving topography as time marches. Second, in contrast to 
the traditional description of governing equations over moving coordinates, the choice of the 
Cartesian components, namely hu and hv, avoids the complicated calculation for the change of 
the coordinate orientation. Third, with an appropriate erosion-deposition criterion, a definite state 
of rest for the whole flow body can be obtained and the inclination angles of the deposition heap 
slopes can be guaranteed about the angle of repose at maximum. Consequently, the maximum 
run-out distance (area) is also well determined without the need of applying the front-tracking 
technique (e.g., LeVeque & Shyue, 1995 or Tai et al. 2002) or the Lagrangian moving-grid 
methods (e.g., Hutter & Koch, 1991, Koch et al., 1994 or Chen & Lee, 2000). Last, as the resting 
state is well defined, the duration of motion as well as the final shape of the deposit can also be 
well identified. In the following, we will demonstrate these advantages by numerical model tests.

inclined channel lies in the range 0 < ξ < 21.5 and the run-out zone lies in the range ξ > 24.5, and 
the section between the two edges is a transition zone which smoothly joins the two regions. 
We set  400  and 0.110 R  for the present test case and, on the top of the chute, the 
initial velocity is given by

where (4.6, 0.0) is the center of the cap on the -surface. Following the experimental validation in 
Tai & Lin (2008), the relevant parameters for erosion/deposition rate: the density ratio  , the 
erosion parameter e , the threshold speed parameter v αv, the regularization parameter e  
and the depth parameter h , are listed in Table I. 
 
As the chute is assumed to be rigid and its slope angle, the internal and basal friction angles 
are 40 , 34  and 23 , respectively, there would be no material deposited or entrained on the 
slope. And we would focus on the formation of the deposition heap on the horizontal plane and 
its interaction with the flowing layer. Figure 3.2 illustrates the thickness contours of the simulated 
results for a sequence of non-dimensional times. The transition zone lies between the two vertical 
dash-dotted lines and the thick red lines represent the outlines of the deposition heap at different 
time. The contour lines are defined at levels 0.001, 0.01, and from 0.05 to 0.61 at an increment 
of 0.04. The avalanche body is found always extending and accelerating in the down-slope 
direction but partly confined in the transverse direction in the inclined chute section. This is due 
to the shallow circular cross-slope topography. Once the front reaches the horizontal run-out zone, 
the basal friction brings the front part of the granular material to rest and the deposition pile 
begins to form, see panels between t = 12 and 14. At the same time, the rear part accelerates 
further, resulting in higher gradients both in the thickness and the velocity, panels from t = 16 to 
18. At t = 22.931 the total volume of the flowing layer is less than initV
610  ( initV =12.496 is the 
initial volume), so we regard the whole avalanche body to be at rest.

that the deposited heap begins to form between t = 12 and 14, and accumulates reversely toward 
the upstream rapidly. The flowing layer becomes a thin layer and flows over the heap when 
impinges on the deposition-heap. It quickly comes to rest when reaches the top of the frontal zone. 
Once the material comes to rest, one can imagine that it is frozen in the static heap and, therefore, 
the maximum run-out distance becomes available. We use the marker “ ” to indicate the ▽
position of the maximum run-out distance, at which the deposition depth is 10−3, the maximum 
reachable distance considered in this paper. In the test flow, the maximum run-out distance, ξ = 
37.2, is reached shortly after t = 18, yet, the deposition-heap continues developing as the rear 
flow continues to flow into the heap. We inspect, on the other hand, the evolution of the growing 
deposition-heap in the transverse direction for the same time interval, Fig. 5. Prior to t = 12, the 
granular mass flows through this cross-section without deposition. Then, the flow mass flux 
decreases as the tail passes through it (t = 12 to 16). At t = 18 the deposited pile is just about 
forming at this cross-section, the thickness of the flowing layer decreases rapidly from t = 20 to t 
= 22, and vanishes at t = 22.931. After this stage, the whole avalanche mass is frozen and the final 
depth profile is kept in the stagnant state.

basal surface of the chute, the blue dashed lines indicate the interface of the deforming deposition heap and the 
red solid lines mark the free surface of the flowing layer. The deposition heap begins to form between t = 12 
and 14, and accumulates reversely toward the upstream rapidly.

deposit are 11.8 and 10.8 for M 0  and M = 0, respectively. Obviously, the deposit is more 
concentrated with a higher peak at the rear when the basal surface is fixed, lower panel of Fig. 3.6. 
This is because there is extra drag induced by the forming deposition heap, i.e. from the 
deflecting flow and the longer frictional surface of the arising bed. The maximum inclination 
angles of the final deposits in both cases are around −22 and −26, respectively, see the upper 
panel of Fig. 3.6. Contrary to its influence on the longitudinal direction, the deforming 
deposition-heap does not have a significant effect in the transverse direction, see Fig. 3.7, the 
thickness contours of the final deposits. The maximum deposit width is 9.6 for both cases.

mass exchange (E− = 0) through the basal surface is assumed. The maximum run-out distances are ξ = 37.2 
with Superbee limiter, indicated by “ ”, and ξ = 38.2, denoted by “♦”. The rear part of the profiles are shown ▽
to continue evolving after t = 24.
