mechanism. The main differences between TCP and SCTP are 
multi-homing and multi-streaming features. The following are 
some features provided by SCTP. 
The two most important enhancements in SCTP over 
traditional transport layer protocols are the end-host multi-
homing and multi-streaming mechanisms [2]. Multi-homing 
provides applications with higher availability than those that 
use TCP. A multi-homed host has more than one network 
interface, and therefore, has more than one IP address for 
communication. In TCP, a connection refers to a channel 
between end-hosts. SCTP introduces the concept of an 
association that exists between two hosts, but can potentially 
collaborate with multiple interfaces at each host. 
Conceptually, an SCTP association is like a TCP connection, 
except that SCTP supports multiple streams within an 
association. All streams within an association are independent, 
but are related to the association. Each stream is given a 
stream identifier and a stream sequence number that are used 
to determine the delivery sequence of received data for multi-
streaming support. Since a SCTP allows packets to be 
switched among multiple streams in an association, it prevents 
the head-of-line (HOL) blocking problem inherit from TCP. 
This powerful mechanism allows SCTP to provide increased 
availability and reliability. 
Like TCP, a SCTP association must be established before 
delivering data segment. But SCTP provides not only reliable 
transfer service, but also partial reliable (PR), unreliable, 
ordered, partial ordered and unordered transfer service. In 
SCTP, if the partial reliability mode is not started, SCTP 
provides reliable transfer service equivalent to TCP, but under 
PR mode, SCTP provides partially reliable transmission service, 
as in UDP. When transmitting the packet, PR-SCTP designates 
the lifetime of the packet; if the packet is not successfully 
transmitted within the scheduled time, PR-SCTP would give up 
transmission of the packet and use Forward TSN chunk that 
notify the endpoint to omit this packet. 
SCTP uses the same port concept as TCP and UDP in 
identifying an association. As shown in Figure 2(a), the SCTP 
packet is composed of a common header and a series of 
chunks. The chunks included in the SCTP packet may be 
control or data chunks, where data chunks contain user 
messages and control chunks contain control information. 
Each chunk begins with a type field, which is used to 
distinguish between data chunks and different types of control 
chunks followed by chunk specific flags and chunk length 
field as chunk length varied (see Figure 2(b)). In addition, for 
reliability and congestion control, each data chunk is assigned 
a unique transmission sequence number (TSN), while stream 
identifiers and stream sequence numbers are used for multi-
streaming support.

SCTP is a message-oriented transport protocol. Unlike 
TCP, SCTP uses transmission sequence number to track the 
order of sent data chunk and its reception at the transport 
layer. The SCTP protocol bases the congestion control on TCP 
congestion control principles and uses SACK extensions for 
reception of acknowledgment at the receiver side. However, 
congestion controls of standard SCTP are applied to the entire 
association whether using multiple source/destination IP 
addresses or multiple paths. Hence, this kind of per-
association congestion control limits the performance of SCTP 
as multiple paths are involved in an association. 
III. CHALLENGES FOR SCTP OVER WIRELESS NETWORKS 
Wireless technologies provide mobile access to networks 
and eliminate the need of fixed cable infrastructures, and thus 
enabling cost-effective network deployment. In recent years, 
wireless networks have been extensively deployed and are 
generally specified in accordance with IEEE 802.11 standards. 
However, a wireless link is commonly characterized by an 
unpredictable bit-error rate and varying latencies, hence, 
wireless environments pose great challenges when attempting 
to provide reliable data transmission for transport protocols, 
such as SCTP. 
Packet losses in a wired network are mainly caused by 
buffer overflows at the bottleneck router. However, over 
wireless networks, packet losses due to buffer overflows at 
intermediate stations occur rarely. It results primarily from 
link-layer contentions or transmission errors [3]. Collision 
occurrences in a shared channel increase as in-flight packet 
numbers increase. Hence, a large sized congestion window 
leads to a higher degree of link-layer contention due to the 
half-duplex nature of wireless links and thus leads to a higher 
number of dropped packets. 
SCTP is an end-to-end transport layer protocol. SCTP 
controls the sending rate, using a congestion window 
parameter. As discussed above, channel access contentions 
may occur between different associations passing through the 
same vicinity, or between different packets within the same 
association, causing SCTP transmission rate to fall as a result 
of frequent invocations of the congestion control mechanism. 
Moreover, frequent packet exchanges taking place over 
wireless networks exacerbate channel contention problems, 
resulting in more packets drop in the MAC layer. This 
exacerbation causes inappropriate invocation of the back-off 
mechanism, further degrading network bandwidth utilization. 
In this event, the SCTP association will spend excessive time 
in attaining an acceptable bandwidth usage, resulting in 
degraded link utilization [4]. 
To address this problem, this study proposes a per-stream-
based scheme to estimate the available bandwidth in a SCTP 
association. In this method, rather than choosing an arbitrary 
initial value for the slow-start threshold, the value is estimated 
during the startup phase to determine if SCTP has achieved 
the full bandwidth of the network. 
 Table 1 shows variations of the SCTP goodput as a 
function of RTT for a conventional SCTP scheme and the 
proposed SCTP scheme, named moderate-SCTP (m-SCTP), 
respectively. The simulation time is 20 seconds and the 
bottleneck bandwidth is 155Mbps. The simulation results 
show that, the goodput of both SCTP procedures decrease as 
the round-trip delay time increases because the SCTP sources 
reduce the transmission rates as ACK packets begin to return 
more slowly. It is also observed that the conventional SCTP 
scheme suffers from serious performance degradation as the 
round-trip delay time continues to increase. However, the 
performance of the m-SCTP scheme is far better due to 
efficient startup procedures. 
TABLE 1. EFFECT OF DIFFERENT ROUND-TRIP TIME 
RTT (ms) Goodput (Mbps) SCTP m-SCTP 
15 112.65 135.81 
20 106.33 126.13 
25 100.39 123.44 
30 92.06 119.86 
35 83.54 114.52 
40 78.69 108.66 
 
Table 2 shows the variation of the SCTP goodput with 
various bottleneck link capacities during 20 seconds. In this 
simulation configuration, the minimal round-trip delay time is 
15ms. As shown in Table 2, when the bottleneck bandwidth 
increases, the conventional SCTP scheme results in a greater 
portion of unused bandwidth before the congestion avoidance 
phase, resulting in lower goodput. The reason is because the 
sender only increases the congestion window size at a rate of 
one packet per RTT after the end of the slow-start phase. 
However, it is observed that the modified m-SCTP scheme 
increases its goodput to a level significantly higher than that of 
the conventional SCTP scheme. Furthermore, by locating the 
estimation mechanism of the STCP sender, the modified 
STCP scheme would not need per-flow support in the routers, 
and thus, can scale to available bandwidth in high-speed with 
large bandwidth-delay networks.

200 144.25 172.52 
 
To evaluate the fairness of the modified SCTP scheme, 
simulations are performed for mixed network scenarios 
involving a single 155 Mbps bottleneck link with a 64-packet 
buffer size. The minimum round-trip time between the source 
and the destination is 10 ms. The network contains a total of 5 
associations, comprising either regular SCTP associations or 
modified m-SCTP associations (i.e., SCTP associations + m-
SCTP associations = 5, thus, a fair share is 31 Mbps). The 
fairness of the network, in terms of the access each SCTP 
association has to the available bandwidth, is measured using 
Jain’s Fairness Index [7] which is defined as:

This fairness index lies between 0 and 1, where 0 denotes the 
least fair, and 1 represents the most fair. 
Table 3 shows the average goodput and the corresponding 
network fairness index. Although the proposed bandwidth 
estimation algorithm provides the m-STCP connections with 
an improved means of acquiring any resources released by the 
participating flows, results show that these connections do not 
take much more than the fair share of the bandwidth. Hence, 
the STCP connections retain a fair share of the bandwidth, as 
m-STCP connections join the network.

The sections below examine certain parameters inherent in 
the 802.11 MAC layer which may affect the SCTP 
performance. The discussions commence with the simple DCF 
infrastructure-based wireless network shown in Figure 4, in 
which the link between AP and D is an 802.11 wireless link 
with a link capacity of 2, 11, or 54 Mbps.

To investigate the impact of channel collisions on the 
SCTP performance, Table 4 shows SCTP goodput over a 
single 802.11 wireless link from simulations. In calculating 
these results, it is assumed that the SCTP chunks are delivered 
via unicast with a packet error rate of 0.005. Therefore, if a 
packet is deemed to be corrupted as a result of channel noise, 
the MAC layer will continue to retransmit the packet until the 
retransmission threshold is exhausted.  
The goodput results in Table 4 indicate that the high-speed 
link is more seriously affected by MAC layer errors. This is 
because conventional SCTP reduces its transmission rate 
drastically following each loss event and hence it takes far
