The subject oriented academic journal and article ranking system was 
designed to help scholars generate core journal and paper ranking list. 
There are three sub-systems in this system. They are the subject 
citations parsing system, the subject core article ranking system and 
the subject citation analysis system. In order to generate the core 
article ranked list for interdisciplinary subjects, four indicators were 
proposed. They are SRCC, STCC, SPI (SRPI and STPI) and SCH 
(SRCH and STCH). Both subject total cited counts (STCC) and 
subject reference cited counts (SRCC) parsing modules were 
constructed and embedded in the subject citation parsing system.
STCC period impact (STPI), STCC cited history (STCH), SRCC 
period impact (SRPI) and SRCC cited history (SRCH) methods were 
used to calculate and rank every article from interdisciplinary subjects.
產業別 
This technique can be used in the field of library and digital content 
industry. This system could be a software product to generate core 
journal and article ranking list. 
技術/產品應用範圍 
The subject core journal and article ranking list generated by our

Method and System to Generate Core Academic Journal and Article Ranked Lists in 
Multidisciplinary Subject-Oriented Areas 
 
Abstract 
Due to the tremendous increase and variations in serial publications, the impact of every peer-review 
journal and paper on different subjects is varying continually. Domain experts or researchers want to keep 
track of those latest and highly cited peer-review journals and papers; however they are finding it difficult 
to update or collect their subject core journal ranking lists and paper ranking lists regularly and accurately. 
The evaluation of serial papers for generating and ranking core journal and paper lists on different subjects 
becomes a very challenging task for scholars or librarians. Therefore, several ranking methods and indicators 
were proposed in this research project in order to generate a subject core journal ranking list and subject core 
article ranking list. Both subject-oriented journal ranking system and subject-oriented article ranking system 
were developed to generate a core journal and article ranked list automatically. Several different subjects and 
disciplines are used as samples to verify our proposed models. We hope that this system can make some 
useful contributions to scholar community.

1. Introduction 
The tremendous increase in the number of serial publications and the impact of a journal paper on 
multidisciplinary subjects varies continually. As a result, faculties or scholars are finding it difficult to 
collect core paper and journal lists on their research subjects regularly and accurately. Librarians are 
finding it increasingly difficult to maintain a current serial collection, which is suitable for 
interdisciplinary subjects.  The evaluation of peer-reviewed papers for generating and ranking core 
paper lists on multidisciplinary subjects becomes a very challenging task for university faculties, 
scholars or librarians. As a result, a computer system and several ranking indicators were proposed in 
order to generate a ranked list of core journal and articles on interdisciplinary subjects for the

4. Method 
1) Subject-Oriented Journal Ranking Method 
Owing to the bi-directional citations existing among journals, we propose and design our own 
approaches. We try to eliminate the noise coming from different amounts of papers in the base journals but 
also subtract the bias of journals’ self-citation. In related works (Snyder, 1998; Tsay, 2006), we learn that 
almost every journal has the serious self-citation situation.  
Therefore, four indexes and factors are proposed in this project: they are JCDF (Journal Cited Factor), 
SJCDF (Subtract Self-Journal Cited Factor), JCIF (Journal Citing Factor) and SJCIF (Subtract Journal Citing 
Factor). In kJCDF (Formula 1), ijDF  is the abbreviation of Cited-Frequency, which counts the base journal’s 
cited frequency (link-in) from “n” kinds of journals in base year of i. In the citation matrix as shown in Table 
3, ijDF  is the cited counts in the horizontal direction. kDA stands for Cited-Articles, which means the 
amounts of articles published by the base journal. “k” is the target journal, whose cited factor is being 
calculated. “m” is the base period from i to m. “j” is the base journal index (j=1,…n).  In Formula 2, 
kSJCDF  not only includes kJCDF  but also eliminates journal’s self-citation problem. When journal j is cited 
by itself (k), ikDF  would be omitted. This is much closer to the real world than JCDF. In Formula 3, kJCIF , 
ijGF denotes the Citing-Frequency, which it counts the base journal’s citing frequency (link-out) from “n” 
kinds of journals in base year of i. GFj is the citing counts in the vertical direction. kGA stands for the 
Citing-Article, which it means the amounts of papers published by the journal “k”. kSJCIF (Formula 4) will 
avoid the self-citation situation as kSJCDF . The major difference between them is that kSJCIF  is for journal 
co-citing counts and the other is for journal co-cited frequencies. For the direction in the citation matrix as in 
Table 3, kSJCDF  is in the horizontal direction and kSJCIF  is in the vertical direction. 
An example is given to show how equation 2 and equation 4 go through to process data. If we are 
going to determine the SJCDF for MISQ journal, ten kinds of base journals (n=10) will be selected from the 
Top 10 journals obtained from JCDF. When MISQ is not within the list of base journal, the cited frequency 
from 10 base journals will be summarized in the base year from 2004 to 2005 (m=2004 and 2005). Then the 
 10
references cite articles on many related subject areas and are not limited to any particular one. kSTCC  has an 
advantage in that it provides scholars a ranked paper list for their subjects of interest. The input article, kA , is 
the processing article among retrieved articles. iA  is one of the references of kA . The cited counts is 
subtracted if the target article matches the reference article. kSTCC  is a simple indicator without recursive 
operation. iT  is the total cited counts for the target article in the WOS database. kSTCC  is subject focused 
because iT  only considers and processes the retrieved articles that match the search keyword with the paper 
title exactly.

kSRPI (Formula 7) is an extension of SRCC. The purpose of this factor is to allow new important papers to 
have a better chance of being ranked highly. The major difference between kSTPI and kSRPI  is that kSTPI  
is an extension of STCC and is therefore suitable for the dataset from STCC, whereas kSRPI  is designed for 
SRCC. As for the number of 0.01 in Formula 8, the purpose is to avoid the case when kSRCC or kSTCC is 
equal to zero.

the 0H  (Formula 12) was that less than 50% of the highly cited papers (cited counts > 4) on different subjects 
were submitted to (S)SCI journals on an average. The t-value was 1.838 (t-value = (0.648-0.5)/(0.213/ 7 )) 
and theα was set to 0.05. The null hypothesis was not significant because of t-value 05.0,6t< . Therefore, 0H  
cannot be rejected and Myth 2 was disproved.
