~0.25 Cr, ~5.5 Zn and 0.2 Ti, which was machined to a diameter of
30 mm and a thickness of 5 mm. Some Si (100) wafers with small
uniform sizes were used for SEM and TEM analyses. The Al alloy
substrates were mechanically ground and polished to an average
roughness of Ra of approximately 0.1 μm. They were then ultrason-
ically cleaned in an acetone bath for 15 min and were soaked in a
methane solution. After the samples were pumped down by a turbo-
molecular pump to a base pressure of 2×10−6 Torr, their surfaces
were further cleaned by Ar ion bombardment under a bias voltage of
−800 V at 1 Torr for 10 min. A dual-target cathodic arc evaporation
(CAE) system was used to deposit multilayer ﬁlms in a single process
as illustrated in Fig. 1. Ti and Cu target materials were mounted on
each side of the cathode, and a substrate connected to a DC power
supply was designed to have a bias output that varied from −80 to
−250 V. In addition, acetylene reactive gases were activated at a
pressure of 20 mTorr, and the substrate holder rotation speed was set
at 4 rpm at the DLC deposition stage. The overall coatings were
designed in the following order: ﬁrst, a TiN interlayer for 5 min;
second, a TiN/CuN layer for 5 min; and ﬁnally, a (Ti:Cu)-DLC
multilayer deposited on top for 10 min (Fig. 2). For convenience, the
substrate bias voltage −80, −150, −200, and −250 V specimen
assemblies used the S1, S2, S3 and S4 abbreviations, respectively. The
structural image of themultilayer ﬁlmwas taken by TEM. The samples
were prepared by mechanical polishing and precision ion polishing
system (Fischione Model 1010). The surface roughness was measured
by surface roughometer(Mitutoyo, Surftest SJ-201 Series). The tests
were conducted with along a line track measuring 0.8 mm in using a
5 μm radius diamond probe that moved at a speed of 0.1 mm/s. The
microstructure of the ﬁlm was analyzed by a micro-Raman spectro-
scope (Tokyo Instruments, INC.), with an excitation at the 632.8 nm
(He–Ne laser) line. The TEM image was taken using JEOL JEM-2010
TEM at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, which provided cross-
sectional and microstructural observations of the as-deposited speci-
mens. The hardness of the coatings was measured using a Vicker's
microhardness tester (Mitutoyo MVK-GB) under a load of 0.25 g. The
tribological tests of the coatings were performed on a ball-on-disc
tribometer (CSEM). The tests were conducted with no lubricant along
a circular track with a diameter of 20 mm using a 6.0-mm Cr ball
which moved at a speed of 30.00 cm/s. The test was conducted under
a normal load of 5 N in ambient atmosphere.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure of (Ti:Cu)-DLC thin ﬁlms
The coatings were compact and exhibited good adhesion to the
substrate. No obvious cracking was observed. The thicknesses of S1,
S2, S3, and S4 were 935, 985, 750 and 680 nm, respectively (Table 1).
The surface morphologies of the samples prepared at selected bias
voltages are shown in Fig. 3. As can be observed, macro-particles
existed in S1, and those of the curvature decreasedwith the increasing
substrate bias voltages, as shown in S2, S3 and S4. The surface
morphology of the as-deposited DLC coatings revealed nanoparticles
dispersed over the surface. As the bilayer thickness decreased, the
roughness value of the ﬁlm also decreased. It may be concluded that
the ﬁlm morphology can be controlled through the variation of the
substrate bias voltage which, in turn, enhances the energy of
bombarding ions. Bringing up the substrate bias voltage during the
deposition allows the back sputtering materials to atomic collision
direction and, hence, ﬁll the shadowed valley areas [21].

attached to chromium and copper, it has a large intensity and becomes
larger as the bias voltage of DLC increases. In parallel, it is accompanied
by an increase of the C = C peak around 1580 cm−1 with DLC
deposition time, indicating a phase dominated by sp2 bonds [24,25].
One could also observe two adjacent peaks: unidentiﬁed peak at
2273 cm−1 and 2388 cm−1, arising from the (Ti:Cu)-DLC matrix.
The FE-TEM images of the cross-sectional morphologies of (Ti:Cu)-
DLC layer/TiN/CuN layer/TiN layer multilayer ﬁlms synthesized at a
substrate bias voltage of −250 V at 180 °C are shown in Fig. 7. The
bilayer thicknesses of S1, S2, S3, and S4 were 32.4, 22, 15 and 8.1 nm,
respectively (Fig. 8). Within a single period, the nano-layers
alternating in Cu are the heaviest elements in the nano-layered Ti-
DLC/Cu coating. The bright layer is the amorphous DLC layer, whereas
the dark layer is the Cu layer. Cu has a nanocrystalline structure. The
interfaces between Ti-DLC and Cu nano-layers appear sharp. Details of
the analysis of alternating nano-layers are presented in Table 1.
HRTEM analysis of the (Ti:Cu)-DLC layer demonstrated that the
Ti-DLC layer was amorphous Fig. 8a. This was conﬁrmed by x-ray
diffraction analysis reported elsewhere [26]. However, in cases S2,
S3, and S4 (see Fig. 8b–d), the thin ﬁlms had a linear interface, and
the nanocrystal orientations of the ﬁlms were Cu (111), Cu (200),
Cu (220), and Cu (311) according to the selected area electron
diffraction (SAD) pattern. This pattern showed the higher resolution
image of the same coating depicting the crystalline Cu layer and the
amorphous DLC layer. The Cu layer showed the formation of large
grains (Fig. 8d). With regard to the S4 specimens, the Ti-DLC/Cu
nanoscale multilayer thin ﬁlms decreased when their crystal orien-
tations changed, as shown when the peak intensity of Cu (111) was
reduced.

range of 0.18–0.27 for a sliding distance of 200 m. The observed low
friction coefﬁcient below 0.27 can be attributed to the presence of
upper (Ti:Cu)-DLC ﬁlms. All of the (Ti:Cu)-DLC coatings (except S4)
exhibited similar wear behaviors. Due to the large bilayer thickness,
the ﬂuctuation of the friction coefﬁcients of S1to S3 became evident,
and this ﬂuctuation resulted in the formation of hard nanoparticles.
For specimens S1 to S3, a small plateau was observed before the peak
in the transient occurred, suggesting that the plateau was associated
with a shift of the sliding interface from the original position to the
line across the center of each soft nanoparticle. The results also
showed that the coefﬁcient of friction decreased sharply at the initial
stage given that friction and surface damage were reduced by the
carbon content. For the specimens subjected to S4 (bias−250 V), the
results showed the lowest friction coefﬁcient of 0.18. It is apparent
that the (Ti:Cu)-DLC coatings retained lower friction coefﬁcient at
approximately 0.15 due to the presence of graphite as conﬁrmed in
previous results.
Regarding the S1 specimens, the coefﬁcients of friction were
observed to be higher at the similar level. This may be attributed to
the high bilayer thickness of 32.4 nm, which led to a thick layer of Cu.
The lubrication and wear resistance of (Ti:Cu)-DLC coatings subjected
to higher bias voltages is then demonstrated and could potentially be
used in applications with no lubricants.
4. Conclusions
(Ti:Cu)-DLC ﬁlms were deposited on 7050 Al alloy using a Ti
cathode and a Cu cathode by cathodic arc plasma deposition method.
The ﬁlms had a multilayered structure, where nanocrystalline Cu
layers alternated with amorphous Ti-DLC layers. The hardness of the
ﬁlms changed with the bias voltages; the ﬁlms deposited at −150 V
exhibited the highest hardness. The coatings exhibited steady-state
friction in the range of 0.18–0.29. The hardness and bi-layer
thicknesses of these ﬁlms depended on the bias voltages: with an
increase in the bias voltages, the hardness and friction coefﬁcient
decreased due to graphitization. Thus, (Ti:Cu)-DLC ﬁlms deserve to be
considered as a hard and lubricating coating for future applications.
