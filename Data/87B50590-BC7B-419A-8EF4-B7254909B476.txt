Abstract 
A thin layer of gold was sputtered onto SUS316L stainless steel (SS) sheet. After thiolizing 
the Au layer with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), layers of chondroitin 6-sulfate (ChS) and 
heparin (HEP) were alternatively immobilized on the Au-treated SS. The resulting stent would be 
both anti-atherogenic and anti-thrombogenic. After repeating one to five cycles, one to five layers 
of polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) of ChS/HEP were successfully fabricated. A model drug, 
sirolimus, was loaded in the ChS/HEP layers. The SS–ChS–HEP surface was examined by X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) 
measurement. Biological tests including hemocompatibility, drug release pattern, and the 
inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation were also performed. The results show that the 
multilayer of ChS/HEP exhibits longer blood clotting time than pure SS substrates. Therefore, 
this biopolymer multilayer can avoid thrombosis on the stainless. The releasing rate of sirolimus 
can be controlled through the number of ChS/HEP PEC layers. With a five-layer coating, 
sirolimus can be released continuously for more than 20 days. Furthermore, the multilayer 
ChS/HEP loaded with sirolimus can suppress specifically to the growth of smooth muscle cells to 
avoid restenosis. This suggests that the PEC multilayer of ChS/HEP modified-SS could be 
applied in making drug-eluting stents. 
Introduction 
Drug-eluting stent has caused many research interests [1-6], early work on stents coated with 
biodegradable polymers (such as polyglycolic acid/polylactic acid copolymers, polycaprolactone, 
polyhydroxy butyrate-co-valerate, and poly(ethylene oxide)/polybutylene terephthalate) as well 
as nonbiodegradable polymers (such as polyurethane, silicone, and poly(ethylene terephthalate)) 
were disappointing and indicated that the polymer triggered long-term inflammation. One of the 
strategies to prevent non-specific adsorption of blood components may be the coating of 
materials with polysaccharide, such as hyaluronic acid (HA), chondroitin 6-sulfate (ChS), and 
heparin (HEP). In general, polysaccharide coating can prevent nonspecific adsorption of proteins 
[7-9].  
Sirolimus, a natural macrocyclic lactone produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus, is a 
potent immunosuppressive agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration [6,18]It is 
“targeting targeting” for inhibiting SMCs proliferation and hence can reduce restenosis. Thus, 
sirolimus will be used in this study as a model drug. In addition, Dimercaptosuccinic acid 
These samples were washed three times with PBS and doubly distilled water. The resulting samples were 
dried in the air at 25◦C. These resulting samples were designated as SS–(ChS–HEP)1. 
The above processes were repeated one, three and five times, and the resulting samples were designated as 
SS–(ChS–HEP)1, SS–(ChS–HEP)3, and SS–(ChS–HEP)5, respectively. The resulting multilayer samples were 
placed in a saturated ethanol solution of sirolimus, and were incubatedat 4◦C for 24h in a shaker at 100 rpm. 
The loading amount of drug in the ChS/HEP PEC multilayer was calculated from the decrease in the 
concentration of sirolimus in the solution determined at 231.6 nm by a UV spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 1100, 
Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK).  
2.2. Surface characterization 
Surface-modified SS samples were analyzed using an XPS (ESCALAB 250, VG Scientific, UK) equipped 
with Mg Kα at 1253.6 eV and 150W power at the anode. A survey scan of varying eV for Au4f, O1s and S2p, 
were taken. The surface roughness was examined using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (MMAFM-2, 
Digital Instrument, Santa Barbara, CA). 
2.3. Blood coagulation time [13-15] 
The blood coagulation cascade included intrinsic pathway, extrinsic pathway, and common pathway. 
Among those coagulation times, the APTT relates mainly to the intrinsic and common 
pathway, PT relates mainly to the extrinsic and common pathway, and FT and TT are used as a measure for the 
time of the fibrinogen transferring to fibrin 
.2.4. Drug release test 
In vitro release testing was carried out by incubating SS–ATMS–HA–HEP substrates encapsulated 
sirolimus in 5ml of buffer solution at 37◦C. At specific time intervals, buffer solution were withdrawn and after 
suitable dilution, the concentration of drug released was measured at 231.6 nm using a UV spectrophotometer. 
2.5. Cell culture [26,27] 
Endothelial cells (ECs, HUVEC human umbilical vein endothelial cell, BCRC number: H-UV001) were 
purchased from Food Industry Research and Development Institute (FIRDI), Taiwan. ECs were grown in 90% 
medium 199 with 25 U/ml heparin, and 30_g/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) adjusted to 
contain 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine. Smooth muscle cell (SMCs, TG/HAVSMC smooth 
muscle cell, human normal aorta smooth muscle cell, BCRC number: 60293) were also purchased from FIRDI 
and were grown in culture medium containing 90% F-12K medium with modifications-Ham’s F12K medium 
with 2mM l-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/l sodium bicarbonate supplemented with 10mM HEPES, 
10mM TES, 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 0.01 mg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml sodium selenite 
and 0.03 mg/ml ECGS and 10% fetal bovine serum. The surface of each modified-SS sheet (2 cm×2 cm) was 
washed with doubly distilled water and sterilized by hydrogen peroxide gas plasma system (STERRAD® 50 
system, a Johnson & Johnson Company, USA) and then placed into the wells of six-well culture plates in 
contact with 2ml of ECs or SMCs (2×105 cells/ml, three to four passages) and were incubated in 5% CO2 at 
37◦C for 5–15 days. Culture medium renewal was carried out about every 2–3 days. 
2.6. MTT assay and morphology of cells [28,29] 
The viability and proliferation of ECs or SMCs culture at specific days were determined by MTT assay. 
The 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma, USA) was prepared as a 5 
mg/ml stock solution in PBS. At the specified days (5, 10 or 15 days), modified-SS sheet was moved to a fresh 
six-well culture plate, and 2ml of fresh culture medium was added to each well. Then 0.5 ml of MTT solution 
8.28 nm) and slightly grainlike structure. However, the surface became rougher after Au coating 
(Ra: 12.71 nm) and DMSA conjugation (Ra: 15.15 nm). More rugged structure (also called 
polymer brush structure) was resulted after the immobilization of one layer of ChS/HEP PEC 
onto the SS–DMSA surface (Ra: 18.34 nm), as shown in Fig. 3(d).  
The roughness increased with the number of coating 
layers. The roughness of the five- and three-layer sample 
(Ra: 20.86 and 19.17 nm) is higher than the one-layer 
sample, indicating that the ChS/HEP PEC can effectively be 
immobilized, as shown in Fig. 3 (d) and (e). Furthermore, 
the surface structure of SS–(ChS–HEP)3 and 
SS–(ChS–HEP)5 became denser than that of 
SS–(ChS–HEP)1. These results indicate that three- and 
five-layer-coaitng may result in lower porosity and denser 
structure than one-layer-coating, and these different 
structures would cause the difference in the drug release 
rate.

SS–(ChS–HEP)1; (e) SS–(ChS–HEP)3; and (f) SS–(ChS–HEP)5 
Table 1 also shows that the thickness of ChS/HEP PEC layer fell between 330 and 690 nm 
(using a spectroscopic ellipsometer). However, the thickness was not proportional to the number 
of layers. It can be attributed to the filling of the “valleys” on the previous layer, that is, the 
subsequent layer of ChS/HEP PEC was bonded on not only the tip but also the slope of the 
brushes 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3 Anti-thrombus properties 
The effects of ChS/HEP immobilization on the clotting times (APTT, PT, TT and FT) of 
pure SS and modified-SS sheets were shown in Fig.4. Immobilized HEP can activate AT III, and 
hence in turn prevent the formation of thrombus [10-17]. The results showed that no significant 
differences are detected concerning the results of the hemocompatiblity of pure SS and SS–ChS 
(APTT from 40.1s of pure SS increased to44.6s, and other clotting times also slightly increased). 
In addition, APTT, PT, TT and FT of SS–(ChS–HEP)1 were 7.8, 4.6, 6.5 and 2.6 folds of those of 
In fact, k increased linearly with the reciprocal of the thickness. Because the exponent n 
varied all around 0.7, the value of k can be regarded as an index of the releasing rate of sirolimus. 
Therefore, the releasing rate of sirolimus decreased with the increase of the number of HA/HEP 
PEC layers. Thus, SS–(ChS–HEP)5 was employed for further cell culture experiment due to its 
longer drug delivery time.  
3.6. Cell proliferation assay 
The migration of SMCs is one of the important components in the formation of 
atherosclerotic plaques to cause in-stent restenosis [32], and hence the effect of sirolimus delivery 
on the growth of ECs and SMCs was evaluated. In this work, the morphology of cells on the 
opaque substrate (SS substrates) was examined by a technique using staining and metallurgical 
microscopy, instead of traditional SEM. SEM is usually used to observe the morphology of cells 
on the opaque surface. However, there are some disadvantages that the processes are difficult (ex. 
cells must be fixed and dried) and it cannot display the true image because cells were dead. Thus, 
we can directly observe the living-ECs and -SMCs on the modified- SS by metallurgical 
microscopy. Fig. 6 (a) and (b) shows the metallurgical microscopy images (50× and inserted 
image: 200×) of ECs proliferation for 15 days cultured with and without sirolimus, respectively. 
There was almost no difference in the number of ECs cultured with or without sirolimus, 
implying sirolimus did not inhibit ECs growth. However, Fig. 6 (c) and (d), the number of SMCs 
decreased significantly when cultured with sirolimus for 15 days. These results demonstrated that 
loading sirolimus on SS–(ChS–HEP)5 indeed can decrease SMCs proliferation while not 
affecting the growth of ECs. 
]Fig. 7 compares the growth of ECs and SMCs on the SS–(ChS–HEP)5 loaded with 
sirolimus and without sirolimus. From Fig. 7(a) shows that ECs number increased with the 
cultured days independent on the loading of sirolimus. On the other hand, the numbers of SMCs 
incubated with sirolimus loaded SS–(ChS–HEP)5 was about 40–50% of that without sirolimus 
SS–(ChS–HEP)5, as shown in Fig. 7(b). The reason is that sirolimus is a “selectigulate 
cytokine-dependent kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thus inducing cell cycle 
arrest in the late G1 phase, and sirolimus is only effective when bound to sirolimus binding 
protein (FKBP) on SMCs. It also inhibits the proliferation of both rat and human SMCs in vitro, 
and reduces intimal thickening in models of vascular injury [8]. Thus, by least more than 15 days 
without affecting the ECs proliferation. ECs provide an anticoagulant barrier between the vessel 
wall and blood [33]. The injury, activation, or death of ECs would induce atherosclerosis, loss of 
semi-permeable targeting role) to inhibited SMCs proliferation to induce restenosis, but also did 
not damage ECs to effect   blood modulation.
