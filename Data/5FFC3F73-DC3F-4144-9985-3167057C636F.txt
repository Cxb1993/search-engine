of 278 binary mixtures (4281 data points) from the 
new model is 0.1047, which is 30% lower than that 
from the original COSMO-SAC (0.1446), 10% lower from 
that of UNIFAC-LLE (0.1161), and comparable to that 
from the modified UNIFAC model (0.1048). The accuracy 
in VLE predictions is also improved. The average 
deviation in total pressure at a fixed liquid 
composition is 6.54% and the overall average 
deviation in vapor phase composition is 2.57% for 
1338 binary mixtures, compared to 7.25% and 2.83% 
from the original model. The average absolute error 
in the solubility of drugs (51 drug compounds in 37 
different solvents and their combinations) from the 
new model is found to be 236 %, a significant 
reduction from that (388 %) of the original COSMO-SAC 
model. The accuracy in prediction of solubility in 
mixed solvent can be greatly improved (average error 
of 70 %), if the measured solubility data in one pure 
solvent is used. Our results show that the improved 
COSMO-SAC model can provide reliable predictions of 
properties of various phase behaviors and is 
applicable drug discovery and environmental 
engineering, in additional to traditional chemical 
processes.

 The restoring solvation free energy accounts for non-ideality due to the difference in 
molecular interactions. In the COSMO-SAC model molecular interactions are calculated from 
the interaction between the surface screening charges when the molecules are in close contact. 
The screening charges can be obtained from first-principles solvation calculation of the 
molecule in a perfect conductor (infinite dielectric constant), a.k.a. the COSMO calculation 
[32]. In the COSMO calculation, the surface of a molecule is dissected to small segments and 
the screening charges are determined for each segment such that the net potential everywhere at 
the surface is zero (perfect screening). These charges are averaged to obtained the apparent 
screening charges to be used in the COSMO-SAC model

charge density of segment (an is the surface area of the segment n); /nn ar   is the radius 
of segment n; /effeff ar   is the radius of a standard surface segment; the empirical 
parameter fdecay has been set previously to 3.57 [42]; and dmn is the distance between segments

 The three-dimensional screening charge density distribution is quantified using a

screening charge density . It is defined as

To have a better description of hydrogen-bonding (hb) interactions, we propose to divide the 
-profile into three components: contributions from surfaces of non-hydrogen bonding atoms, 
from surfaces of hydroxyl (OH) group, and from surfaces of all other types of hydrogen bond 
donating and accepting atoms, i.e.,  
)()()()( 000  OTOHnhb pppp            (6) 
where )(0 nhbp  is the collection of all non-hydrogen-bonding segments; )(0 OHp are the 
segments on the hydroxyl groups; and )(0 OTp  includes all the other hb segments, that is the 
segments belong to oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, or hydrogen atoms connected to N or F atoms. 
For interactions between atoms of hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors, Wang et al.[33] 
suggested refining the hydrogen bonding sigma profiles by removing the less polarized surfaces 
using a Gaussian-type function 
6 
 
[Eq. (3)] and the -profile is created according to Eqs. (4), (6), or (8). The -profile of the 
mixture is then computed using Eq. (5). The segment activity coefficients for each pure liquid 
and mixture are calculated from Eq. (9). The restoring free energy can then be obtained from 
Eq. (13) and the activity coefficients of each of the component in the mixture from Eq. (1). 
 
 
4. Results and Discussion 
The revised model is validated using both LLE (278 binary mixtures with temperatures 
ranging from 243.15 K to 483.45 K) and VLE (1338 binary mixtures with temperature ranging 
from 207.92 K to 553.15 and pressure from 0.112 kPa to 6.87 MPa) data. All the data are taken 
from the DECHEMA Chemistry Data Series [48, 49]. To facilitate the analysis, the mixtures 
were categorized into three types [40, 50]. Type I are the systems that do not have any 
hydrogen bonding (hb) interactions, such as nitromethane + benzene and acetone + hexane. The 
type II systems include a compound that has an hb self association, for example, water + 
hexane and ethylamine + benzene. In type III systems, both self and cross hb associations occur 
as in the water + acetone and nitromethane + ethylamine systems.

4.1. Liquid-liquid equilibria 
 Table 2 summarizes RMS errors in LLE predictions from 4 liquid models. The revised 
COSMO-SAC model is the most accurate, with the lowest RMS error of 0.1047, which is 28% 
less than that from original COSMO-SAC (0.1446) and similar to that from the modified 
UNIFAC [26] (0.1048) and UNIFAC-LLE [51] (0.1161) models. Furthermore, the revised 
COSMO-SAC model is most successful in terms predicting the presence of a miscibility gap in 
that 243 out of the 278 systems are predicted to exhibit LLE, where as only 226 from the 
original COSMO-SAC, 225 from modified UNIFAC and only 200 from UNIFAC-LLE. Note 
that here a system is a set of LLE data for a specific binary mixture. The reason for a model 
failing to predict the presence of a miscible gap may be (1) the mixture is predicted to be 
completely miscible, (2) the temperature is above the predicted upper critical solution

temperature dependence of the miscible gap for type II systems. 
 The prediction of LLE in type III systems is most challenging because it requires an 
accurate description of the subtle differences in the hb interactions among all the species pairs. 
As shown in Table 2, when compared with original COSMO-SAC, the RMS error from revised 
COSMO-SAC is reduced by 38% and the number of systems that are successfully described 
miscible gaps increases from 90 to 109. Fig. 2a and 2b are examples in which the revised 
COSMO-SAC model predicts the existence of LLE but the original COSMO-SAC model does 
not. In addition, the performance of the revised model for systems containing amines is slightly 
improved, as shown in Fig. 2c and 2d. Therefore, we conclude that the distinction of hb 
interactions [Eq. (12)] is very effective for type III systems. The Modified UNIFAC model 
gives the lowest RMS error and sometimes results in better prediction of the temperature 
dependence of miscible gap. However, this model and UNIFAC-LLE is limited in its 
applicability by the availability of binary interaction parameters and the appropriate group 
definitions.

It is useful to point out some limitations of the revised COSMO-SAC model in LLE 
10 
 
the improvement is very significant. As a reference, the predictions from the modified UNIFAC 
model [26] are also listed in Table 3. The modified UNIFAC model is the most accurate method, 
with the overall AARD-P and AAD-y1 being 2.93% and 1.53%, respectively. (Note that fewer 
systems are considered with modified UNIFAC because of missing functional group parameters 
[26] for some species.) Fig. 3 shows the VLE of one system at high temperature (488.15 K) and 
one system at a lower temperature (333.15 K). In both cases, the revised model is clearly more 
accurate than the original model. This again supports the use of temperature-dependent 
electrostatic interactions [Eq. (13)]. For systems having hb interactions, i.e. types II and III 
systems, significant improvement is also found as illustrated in Fig. 4, especially for systems 
containing amino group (-NH2 or -NH) (Fig. 4a to 4c). The improved accuracy in VLE 
predictions of the revised COSMO-SAC model is due to the two modifications made in this 
work.

4.3 Solubility of Drugs 
The solubility limit of a solid drug i in a solvent S (whose composition is denoted by x) is 
determined from the equality of chemical potentials of the drug i in the solid (assuming a pure 
12 
 
pairs for drug solubility in pure solvent (362 systems) and 156 mixture solvent combinations 
(298 systems), including 152 binary solvent mixture (287 systems), 3 ternary solvent mixtures 
(10 systems) and 1 quaternary solvent mixture (1 system). The temperature ranges from 273.15 
to 323.15 K and the solubility data (in mole fractions) range 10-1 to 10-6. The complete list of 
the data is given in the Supporting Information. Because of the large variations in the solubility 
the predicted errors are measured using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of natural 
logarithm of solubility as follows[44]

where N is the number of data points per system [one drug in a (mixture or pure) solvent at a 
certain temperature]; the notations calc and expt denote the data from calculations or 
experiments, respectively. 
As summarized in Table 4, the overall RMSEs from revised COSMO-SAC for drug solubility 
in pure solvents is 1.81 (corresponding to 514 % in percentage error), a slight reduction from 
the original COSMO-SAC model (1.92 or 580 %). The improvements in mixture solvent 
systems are more significant. The overall RMSE of drug solubility predictions in binary 
solvents from revised COSMO-SAC is 1.24 (245 %) which is only about 60 % of that from the 
original COSMO-SAC (1.61 or 401 %). Similar improvements are observed for other 
multi-solvent systems. The RMSE of the original COSMO-SAC model is similar to that in Shu 
and Lin’s work[60] [which is 1.61 based on fewer data points (1955 data points (235 systems) 
for 33 drugs in 37 solvents)]. As stated in the work of Mullins et al.,[44] the original 
COSMO-SAC model generally over-predicts the solubility. Similar tendency is observed in the 
predictions from the revised COSMO-SAC model. Nonetheless, the revised COSMO-SAC 
method provides a better accuracy than the original COSMO-SAC model.

With the experimental drug solubility data in the relevant pure solvents, the accuracy in 
the prediction of the drug solubility in mixed solvents can be greatly improved. This method is 
suggested recently by Shu and Lin[60] and denoted as “COSMO-SAC+Cor” here. Although 
this correction method requires additional input of experimental drug solubility data in the pure 
solvent, it can eliminate two important issues in the prediction of drug solubility. First, the error 
caused by uncertainties in the estimations or measurements of melting temperature and heat of 
fusion are reduced. Second, the issue of conformational flexibility becomes less significant.[60] 
As listed in Table 4, the overall RMSE in the prediction of drug solubility is only 0.53 (or 70 %)

5. Conclusions 
 In this project we have improved the thermodynamically exact (meaning satisfying the 
Flmer condition) COSMO-SAC model for various types of fluid phase equilibria, including 
vapor-liquid (VLE), liquid-liquid (LLE) and solid-liquid equilibria. We show that the new 
model can provide accurate predictions over a wide range of conditions (chemical diversity, 
temperature, concentration ranges). Two modifications have been introduced into the 
COSMO-SAC model to improve its accuracy. Making the electrostatic interaction parameter 
temperature-dependent is found to be very effective in improving LLE predictions for 
non-hydrogen bonding systems. In addition, the variation of hydrogen bonding strength for 
different donor-acceptor pairs is taken into account. This is realized by the separation of the 
hydrogen bonding surfaces, and hence the -profile, in to those involving OH groups and 
separately from all others. The 5 parameters [two electrostatic interaction parameters (AES and 
BES) and three hydrogen bonding interaction parameters (cOH-OH, cOH-OT, and cOT-OT)] introduced 
as a result of these modifications are determined by regression using a small set of LLE data. 
The revised model is much more accurate than the original one for the description LLE, and its 
accuracy is comparable to that from the modified UNIFAC. More importantly, the performance 
of the revised model for VLE is also improved. Therefore, the revised model is a more accurate 
method for both VLE and LLE predictions when no experimental data are available. 
 In terms of solid-liquid equilibria, we show that the overall RMSE (root-mean-square 
error) of predictions of the revised COSMO-SAC model in the natural logarithm of drug 
solubility for 51 drugs in 37 organic solvents and their combinations from the is 1.21 
(corresponding to 236 % in percentage error), a reduction of 25 % when compared with 1.59 
(388 %) from the original COSMO-SAC model. The RMSE in logKOW is found to be 1.14 from
