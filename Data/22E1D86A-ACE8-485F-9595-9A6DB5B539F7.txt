ABSTRACT 
     We designed and fabricated a continuous-flow cell culture array with chaotic 
mixers. By using this microfluidic device, combinations of GF’s concentrations can 
be reliably mixed and supply to each cell culture well and the optimum combina-
tions of GFs (VEGF & bFGF) was quickly obtained for mESC differentiation into 
ECs & SMCs. 
 
KEYWORDS: Cell Array, Continuous-Flow Cell Culture, ES, Cell Differentiation 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Stem cells differentiation relies on microenvironment control for inductive sig-
naling and initiation. In finding the optimum growth factor (GF) combinations for 
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) differentiation into endothelial cells (ECs) 
and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), we developed a continuous-flow cell culture plate 
with integrated micro fluidics mixers. The continuous feeding of medium allows us 
to conduct long-term microscopic monitoring of the differentiation process of the 
ECs on the micro plate within a micro incubator without moving the plate conven-
tionally needed for changing the medium and further reduces the autocrine and 
paracrine signaling. The micro cell culture plate with mixers to supply the cell cul-
ture array is shown in Figure 1.  The need to continuously supply medium in a few 
10’s to 100’s μl/hr to the cells etc. determines the flow velocity and the needed 
mixer dimensions.  Since the molecular weight of these GFs are typically a few 
10’s~100’s kDa in sizes, a conventional serpentine mixer with diffusion-limited 
laminar flow mixing will not mix the molecules adequately within a millimeter-size 
micro fluidics channel.   Therefore, we design a cell culture plate consisting of an 
array of cell culture wells and 7-stage staggered-herringbone-ridge [1] serpentine 
mixers that enable GFs to mix completely within a few millimeters. 
 
THEORY 
Microfluidic Chaotic Mixer & Microwell Arrays 
continuous-flow media feeding was turn on.  Since the continuous media cell culture 
experiments took two weeks, the incubation media with GFs were kept in 4oC inside 
the syringe pumps to maintain GFs’ efficacies and feed into the micro fluidics de-
vices kept in 37 o C incubator with a flow rate of 30 μL/hr.  The heat transfer of the 
system is designed such that the media is warmed up to 37 oC when it reaches the 
micro fluidics devices with mESC inside. 
 The differentiation ability of stem cell is highly sensitive to its environment, and 
the current microfluidic devices provide precisely controlled microenvironment and 
quickly identify the optimum combination of GFs. [2]  Both Vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) & basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are used in this ex-
periment.  VEGF is requisite for vasculogenesis [3] and bFGF has less obvious ef-
fective for mESCs differentiation.[4] mESCs were cultured in an array of cell-
culture wells for 7 days and 14 days, and each row of wells has a specific combina-
tion of VEGF & bFGF injected from inlet A and B as shown in Figure 4.  At the end 
of each growth period, cells were labeled by surface markers anti CD34  & anti α-
smooth muslle actin and the percentage of differentiation were counted for each 
GF’s combination. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Microfluidic Mixer Experiments: Figure 3(a) are microscope photos indicating the 
uniformly mixed reagents at the exit of the chaotic serpentine mixer stage in com-
parison to the clearly visible colored/clear boundary of  reagents at the exit of the 
serpentine mixer at the stage 2 where the flow rate is 20 μL/hr. The intensity curves 
are shown in Figure 3(b) (analyzed by image-pro plus) indicating the uniform mix-
ing of reagents of the chaotic serpentine mixer at the exit.

water are injected to the serpentine mixer (a) and the chaotic serpentine mixers (b) 
to assess the mixing efficiency.  
 
mESC Differentiation Experiments:  Figure 5 (a) shows the experimental results 
of VEGF medium supplied from inlet A with a concentration of 10 ng/mL and cul-
ture medium supplied  from inlet B. No significant EC differentiation was observed 
on day 7, and significant differentiation is achieved on day 14. The differentiation
