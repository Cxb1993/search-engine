 奈米結構用於薄膜太陽能電池有下列優點： 
i. 奈米結構可降低光的散射，使得有效的光吸收遠高於傳統平面薄膜堆疊。 
ii. 光產生之電子電洞對傳輸至電極路徑比傳統短，可降低復合機率。 
iii. 由於奈米結構降低光的散射，其吸收層厚度亦將大幅降低。

英文摘要 
Nano-structured Cu2O/ZnO nanorod (NR) heterojunction solar cells fabricated on indium tin 
oxide (ITO) coated glass are studied. Substrate film and NR density have a strong influence on the 
preferred growth of the Cu2O film. The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis results show that highly 
(200)-preferred Cu2O film was formed when plating on plain ITO substrate. However, a highly 
(111)-preferred Cu2O film was obtained when plating on sparse ZnO NRs. SEM, TEM and XRD 
studies on sparse NR samples indicate that the Cu2O nano-crystallites mostly initiate its nucleation 
on the peripheral surfaces of the ZnO NRs, and are also highly (111)-oriented. Solar cells with ZnO 
NRs yielded much higher efficiency than those without. In addition, ZnO NRs plated on a ZnO 
coated ITO glass significantly improve the shunt resistance and open circuit voltage (Voc) of the 
devices, with consistently much higher efficiency obtained than when ZnO NRs are directly plated 
on ITO film. However, longer NRs do not improve the efficiency due to low short circuit current (Jsc) 
and slightly higher series resistance. The best conversion efficiency of 0.56 % was obtained from a 
Cu2O/ZnO NRs heterojunction solar cell fabricated on a 80 nm ZnO coated ITO glass with Voc = 
0.514V, Jsc= 2.64 mA/cm2 and 41.5 % fill factor. 
We also have demonstrated superstrate type nano-structured solar cells with ZnSe/ZnO 
coaxial NWs embedded in the CuInSe2 (CIS) layer. Complete filling of the CIS film into the narrow 
 4 
while undoped In2O3/Cu2O heterojunctions prepared by pulsed laser deposition exhibited ohmic 
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics [7], and a low conversion efficiency (η) of 0.02% was revealed 
from p-CuO/n-Cu2O heterojunctions [8]. In addition, a high turn on voltage (4.7 V) was measured 
from an F-doped SnO2 (FTO)/Cu2O device, and no efficiency was obtained from it [9]. In spite of 
these results, Cu2O film in conjunction with ZnO or Al doped ZnO (AZO) exhibited better rectifying 
I–V characteristics and conversion efficiency [7,10]. The non-toxic, low cost, and favorable 
conduction band edge alignment of ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells has recently attracted 
significant interest [11-13], and a conversion efficiency of 2% has been reported from 
ITO/ZnO/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells [14]. However, this efficiency is still much lower than the 
theoretical limit. Further work devoted to this semiconductor is thus essential to better understand 
its material properties and to improve the efficiency gap. 
Cu2O thin films can be prepared by various techniques, such as reactive sputtering [15], 
vacuum evaporation [16], electrochemical deposition (ECD) [17-20] and direct oxidation of Cu 
sheets [14], of which the ECD process is a non-vacuum, simple and ultra low cost approach, and is 
an attractive approach in the highly competitive solar panel market if such devices can be improved 
further. A Cu2O film with (111) preferred orientation may have slightly better conversion efficiency 
than a (200)-oriented one [13]. Furthermore, nano-structured ZnO NRs with or without Cu2O film 
have attracted interest for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications, such as in sensors [21], 
solar cells [12] and luminescent devices [22]. However, the reported conversion efficiency of the 
nano-structured solar cells with p-Cu2O/n-ZnO nanowire arrays is also low (0.1%). This is because 
the sputtered or e-beam evaporated Cu2O (absorber) film is not able to fill the space or gaps 
between the NRs, and thus little or limited absorption occurs. 
In this paper, sparse ZnO NRs were constructed on ITO or on ZnO coated ITO glass using 
ECD to improve the absorber film filling. The absorber-filled NR structure increases the effective p-n 
junction area. The vertical junction along the peripheral surfaces of the NRs will enhance the 
efficiency of photogenerated carrier collection, especially for materials with low minority-carrier 
diffusion lengths [23]. Enhanced light trapping and better sunlight absorption have been reported in 
a nanowire device [24]. The NR device should provide improvements in efficiency as compared to a 
conventional planar p-n junction solar cell. In this study, the influence of the ZnO NR density on the 
preferred growth of ECD Cu2O thin film and its nucleation are reported. Conversion efficiency of 
0.56% from a (111)-oriented Cu2O/ZnO radial heterojunction solar cell is demonstrated.   
 
2. Experimental details (研究方法) 
A polycrystalline p-Cu2O/n-ZnO NR heterojunction was prepared by plating sparse ZnO NRs 
on commercially available indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass or on ZnO coated ITO glass, followed 
by using ECD process to deposit a Cu2O thin film to fill the space between the sparse ZnO NRs. 
The schematic diagram of the solar cell is shown in Fig. 1.

Note: The blanket ZnO films were annealed at 300 oC for 30 min after deposition, except cell C 
(400 oC); All Cu2O films were annealed at 300 oC for 30 min, except cell E (5 min).   
 
The length and density of the ZnO NRs are controlled by the plating time and the solution 
concentration, respectively. The Cu2O films were 3 µm thick and were annealed at 300 oC for 30 
min after the plating. A four-point probe was used for the Cu2O sheet resistance measurements 
before and after the annealing (except cell A). A 500 nm thick silver film, provides good ohmic 
contact to Cu2O (back side) and ITO (front side), was deposited through a shadow mask by direct 
current sputtering with a two-inch Ag target at a power of 30 W. The effective area of the solar cells 
was 0.42 cm2. 
The band-gaps of the blanket ZnO and Cu2O films were determined by measuring the 
transmitted intensities from 300 to 1600 nm using a JASCO V-670 spectrophotometer. All ECD 
experiments were carried out using an AutoLab potentiostat/galvanostat power unit (model 
PGSTAT128N). The deposition time of a typical ZnO NRs with 400 nm in length was approximately 
200 sec for a fixed -0.8 volt, while 700 sec at -2 mA was used for plating a 3 µm thick Cu2O film. A 
hot-probe measurement indicates that the prepared Cu2O film exhibited p-type conductivity.  
Surface morphology and cross-sectional images of the ZnO NRs, as well as the Cu2O films, 
were observed with a Hitachi S4100 scanning electron microscope (SEM) at an accelerating 
voltage of 15 keV. The nucleation and growth of the Cu2O were investigated using a Philips Tecnai 
F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a 200 kV accelerated voltage. A 
SHIMADZU/XRD6000 X-ray diffractometer (XRD) was used for phase identification of the films 
using Cu-Kα radiation (λ=1.5406 Å) with a two-degree incident angle. A ScienceTech model SF150 
collimated solar simulator with a Keithley 2400 source meter was used for solar cell efficiency 
measurements and operated under one Sun with AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2 at 25oC, and all cells were 
tested without anti-reflective coating. The shunt (Rsh) and series (Rs) resistance of the solar cell 
were calculated from the linear part of the J–V curve near the short-circuit current point and the 
open-circuit voltage point, respectively. 
All chemicals used (reagent grade) for the ZnO NR and Cu2O plating were purchased from 
Shimakyu’s Pure Chemicals. 
 
3. Results and Discussion (結果與討論) 
3.1 Film properties 
 
From the UV-visible transmission spectra of the as-RF-deposited blanket ZnO and Cu2O films 
(not shown), the optical absorption coefficients (α) of these films were determined from the spectral 
 8 
sparse ZnO NRs. 
 
SEM images of the Cu2O film surfaces and XRD spectra of the films are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, 
respectively. As can be seen clearly in Fig. 3, the Cu2O film morphology depends on the substrate it 
is deposited on. Square-based Cu2O truncated pyramids were formed (Fig. 3a) when it deposited 
on blanket ITO-coated glass substrate, whereas truncated Cu2O triangle pyramids or truncated 
pyramidal corners were observed (Fig. 3b) if plating on a substrate with dense ZnO NRs. However, 
unique Cu2O grains (Fig. 3c), which look like wedges or three-sided pyramids, were observed when 
plating on a substrate with sparse ZnO NRs. Fig. 4 indicates the preferred Cu2O crystal plane is the 
(200) plane when plating on an ITO substrate. However, the same plating conditions formed a 
strongly (111)-preferred Cu2O film on a substrate with sparse ZnO NRs. For a substrate with dense 
ZnO NRs, the Cu2O (200) XRD peak is barely higher than that of the (111) peak. Obviously, 
substrate and ZnO NR density have a strong influence on the preferred growth of the ECD Cu2O 
film and film morphology.

240 nm above the top of the nanorods after 30 seconds and 40 seconds plating, respectively.

3.3 Heterojunction structure and solar cell performance  
Several nano-structured ZnO NRs/Cu2O heterojunction solar cells were fabricated, as listed in 
section 2. The Cu2O film can not only be formed on the ZnO NR surfaces, but also can be deposited 
on the ITO film where no ZnO NRs are grown, and solar cells fabricated directly on a ITO substrate 
will have ZnO(NR)/Cu2O and ITO/Cu2O junctions. In contrast, only the ZnO/Cu2O interface can form 
for solar cells made on a ZnO coated ITO substrate. The effects of thinner ZnO films coated on ITO 
glass and longer ZnO NRs were also studied. 
Fig. 8a shows a typical SEM image of the hetero-structure with Cu2O film plating on sparse 
ZnO NRs using a 300 nm ZnO coated ITO glass. The film on top of the ITO is the ZnO film and 
some ruptured ZnO NRs (due to sample preparation), as shown in Fig. 8b. In this case, the height of 
the NRs is approximately 500 nm. The alkaline solution (pH=12.1) used to grow Cu2O film did not 
erode the ZnO film/NRs or degrade its quality [32]. In addition, it should be noted that the cell 
structure in Fig. 8a has ZnO NRs embedded inside the Cu2O film. The Cu2O film, ~3.4 µm above 
the top of the ZnO NRs, has large grains and is continuous. There are no voids between the grains, 
 12 
(3.28), indicating the area near the junction (sputtered ZnO/Cu2O) contained more defects than 
those in the ZnO NRs/Cu2O samples. The degraded junction quality resulted in a low fill factor 
(25.7%) and lower efficiency. Moderate recombination also slightly lowers the Voc value. The ZnO 
NR plating process may have helped nucleating additional ZnO nano-crystallites into the grain 
boundaries of the sputtered ZnO film, which prevents Cu2O growth and improves Rsh. This is 
consistent with a higher Rsh value extracted from all cells with ZnO/ZnO NRs layers. Cell F used 
longer (~600 nm) ZnO NRs, which do not seem to improve cell efficiency. This may be because 
longer and undoped ZnO NRs could result in carrier loss. In addition, low Jsc and higher Rs were 
observed. The increased ZnO NR plating time not only increases the length and diameter of the 
NRs, but also increases the NR density due to initiating more nucleating sites. As our earlier results 
stated, higher NR density favors Cu2O (200) growth, which results in higher sheet resistance than 
that of a (111)-oriented Cu2O film. This is consistent with the slightly higher Rs measured. Higher NR 
density may also cause difficulties with regard to Cu2O filling the narrow space between the NRs, 
and any voids thus created mean a loss of junction area and a loss of photocurrent. Overall, the 
vertical junction along the NR surfaces should enhance the photogenerated carrier collection, 
however, an insignificant improvement in Jsc was observed, and a substantial level of incomplete 
carrier collection may have occurred along the ZnO NR and ZnO path. 
 
Table 1. Device parameters of all solar cells tested under AM 1.5G at room temperature. All  
devices have the same active area of 0.42 cm2. Parameters Rsh and Rs are  
calculated from the linear part of the J–V curve near Jsc and at Voc, respectively. NR  
length is measured from the SEM cross-sectional image of one typical sample  
having about ± 50 nm sample to sample variations.
