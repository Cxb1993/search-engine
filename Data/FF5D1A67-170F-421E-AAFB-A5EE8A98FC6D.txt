1. Introduction
Reduction of variability is an important objective of improving the process
performance and quality in all industrial applications. The required qualities of the
nano-particles milling process are that the mean of grain size and the variance of
nano-particle grain size must be kept small. These two output quality criteria result in
a two-objective (Min-Min) optimization problem. Hence, a multi-population
intelligent genetic algorithm (MPIGA) is proposed to find the Pareto-optimal
solutions for decision makers to determine the optimal process parameters in the
nano-particle milling process. However, the dynamic manufacturing process with
continuous variation phenomena or unexpected effect of process parameters may
cause the nano-particles milling process to shift away from the optimal process
condition and to make defective products. Hence, engineers of the nano-particles
milling process have to regulate the process parameters back to optimal condition
immediately when the milling process is shifted or under unstable conditions. But, the
know-how rules used to regulate the process parameters are still unknown in the
nano-particles milling process. In addition, it is necessary to develop a process
parameter regulation system for the nano-particle milling process that can guide
engineers to set the process parameters. Therefore, developing a process parameter
regulation system which can simultaneously meet multi-quality criteria for the
nano-particles milling process is a critical issue.
2. Literature Review
With the rapid development of the computational intelligence, many learning
mechanisms, such as neural networks (Pasquiera et al., 2001; Tung et al., 2005; Jiao et
al., 2004; Wu et al., 2005) and genetic algorithm (Herrera et al., 1995; Setzkorn and
Paton, 2005) are combined with fuzzy set to develop a fuzzy rule-based control
system. The fuzzy rule-based control systems of the so-called Takagi-Sugeno (TSK)
type (Takagi and Sugeno, 1985) or Mamdani-style inference (Mamdani and Assilian,
1975) have been widely used in modelling and controlling complex, nonlinear and
uncertain systems because of their computational efficiency, transparency and
al., 1998; Mliller and Wiederhold, 2002; Abonyi et al., 2003; Carvalho and Freitas,
2004; Dombi and Zsiros, 2005). The most important feature of decision trees are their
capability to break down a complex decision-making process into a collection of
simpler decisions (Safavian and Landgrebe, 1991) and the procedure of decision tree
pruning can reduce over-fitting and increase accuracy of classification.
The differences among these rule-induction techniques are the rule accuracy, rule
completeness and computational complexity. However, which technique has the
higher reasoning accuracy and completeness of rule-base is still unknown. Therefore,
the variable precision rough set theory and decision tree algorithms are
simultaneously used to extract rules from the deviation data of a nano-particle milling
process in this dissertation.
3. Methodology
In the research, an integration of computational intelligence techniques is proposed
to develop a process parameter regulation system which can simultaneously meet
multi-quality criteria for a nano-particle milling process. The integrated computational
intelligence techniques consist of ART-2 neural networks, fuzzy set theory, variable
precision rough set, decision tree and fuzzy rule-based control techniques. In addition,
the regulation scheme is based on adjusting the process parameters using information
about its current deviation from the desired target. Therefore, it is necessary to define
the “desired target”in advance before developing a process parameter regulation
system. Here, the results of the Pareto-optimal parameters found by multi-population
intelligent genetic algorithm (MPIGA) are used as the desired target.
Based on the results of the Pareto-optimal parameters, a process parameter regulation
system is developed by using integrated computational intelligence techniques. First
of all, the shift values between the current value and the Pareto-optimal value (△X,
△Score(X)) are calculated to find their deviations. The ART-2 neural network is then
used to cluster the deviation data of process parameters and Pareto quality criteria.
Based on the results of the ART-2, the fuzzification procedure of fuzzy set theory is
applied to define the membership functions of the process parameters and Pareto
quality criteria. Third, the data mining techniques, variable precision rough set theory
and decision tree, are respectively used to extract rules from the deviation data of a
nano-particle milling process. Fourth, a “reverse procedure”is applied to transform
the extracted rules into the fuzzy reasoning rules. Fifth, a process parameter regulation
system based on fuzzy rule-based control and Mamdani-style mechanism, which
consists of a fuzzification, a fuzzy inference and a defuzzification, is developed by

Based on the fuzzification procedure, the shifted process parameters and quality
criterion are transformed into attribute variables. These results are respectively
applied to extract the fuzzy rules by using variable precision rough set (VPRS) and
decision tree C5.0 algorithm.
4.3 The results of using data mining techniques to extract fuzzy rules
The data mining techniques, variable precision rough set and decision tree, are
respectively used to extract fuzzy rules from the results of fuzzification for the shift
process parameters and quality criterion. First, the variable precision rough set (VPRS)
is developed and run on Matlab 7.0 software. When  is set at 0.35 and β-lower
approximation is applied, the extracted certainly rules using VPRS and their
corresponding misclassification values are summarized in Table 4. It is found that
there are 44 rules extracted by using the VPRS approach.

applied as the fuzzy inference mechanism, and the center of gravity method is used in
the defuzzification in the process parameter regulation system. Once the deviations
input data is put into the system, some possible rules will be induced. The
Mamdani-inference style is applied to do reasoning and center of gravity method is
used to defuzzify the reasoning results. Therefore, the reasoning output can be used to
guide engineers to regulate the process parameters and to set the process parameter
values.

4.4 The results of verified performance of the developed process parameter regulation
system
All of the 27 orthogonal array data shown in Table 1 are applied to verify the
performance of developed regulation system. The verified results of regulation system
are summarized and shown in Table 5. The average percentage of system’s
performance is 85.9% and the average number of adjustments is 4.4 times. It means
that using the extracted rules found by VPRS and C5.0 algorithm as reasoning
rule-base to develop a process parameter regulation system has 85.9% average
performance in shortening the shift value. For all 27 test data, the regulation system
can improve the nano-particle milling process from current shift condition to low shift
condition. This demonstrates that the developed process parameter regulation system
with multi-quality criteria indeed can be applied to guide engineers to regulate the
process parameters and to set the process parameter values when the nano-particle
milling process is shifted.

the ART-2, the fuzzification of fuzzy set theory is applied to define the membership
function of the process parameters and quality criteria. Third, the data mining
techniques, variable precision rough set theory and decision tree C5.0 algorithm, are
respectively used to extract rules from the deviation data of a nano-particle milling
process. Fourth, a“reverse procedure”is applied to transform the extracted rules into
the fuzzy reasoning rules. Fifth, a process parameter regulation system based on fuzzy
rule-based control and Mamdani-style mechanism, which consists of a fuzzification, a
fuzzy inference and a defuzzification, is developed by using Matlab 7.0 software.
Finally, the performances of developed process parameter regulation system are
verified by using the 27 orthogonal array data as the test data.
The verification results show that the developed process parameter regulation system
almost can improve the nano-particle milling process from current shift condition to
the low shift condition for all 27 test data. The regulation system indeed can be
applied to guide engineers to adjust the process parameters and to set the process
parameter values when nano-particle milling process is shifted.
