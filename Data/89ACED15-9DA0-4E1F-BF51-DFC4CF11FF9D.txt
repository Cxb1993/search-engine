extended product are abstract, like the relativity of products, the concept of brand for example (Park 
etc. 1991). As for the definition of similarity of narrow sense, it could be divided into product trait 
similarity (Keller and Aaker, 1992; Boush and Loken, 1991) and product category similarity (Aaker 
and Keller, Park etc, 2002). 
 
     To solve the problem of subjective of design patent on judging the infringement, this study 
researched 5 representative cases of design patent to examine, and to compare with the existing 
justice judgements. The researcher expected to define an objective scope of designing similarity.  
The major purposes of this study:   
(1) To research the similarity of products’ form, and to quantify the level of plagiarism by general 
public recognition. 
(2) To compare with the existing justice judgements of quantification data by general public. 
(3) To compare with gender, education level, occupation and professional/non-professional persons 
for recognizing the differences among these factors of the designing similarity.  
 
     Design patents depend on the judicial judgement by the judge’s professional judgement very 
much; however, the essence of design patent is to avoid confusing consumers by the mean 
plagiarisms. As a result, if there were a viewpoint of consumer to identify whether the design patent 
infringed or not and there would be several advantages as the following below: (1) It could be more 
helpful to the objective of the judgement; (2) It could release the pressure of the judge for doing a 
subjective decision; (3) It could be a persuasive judgement to the general public; (4) It could save 
the resources of judicial judgement. This study anticipated by an academic viewpoint to provide the 
data which were after analyzing all the factors to legal community as references, and also 
anticipated that the study results could influence the subjective way of examining design patent in 
the future. 
 
2. Method 
   
Participants would be required to do the similarity questionnaires by this study, and the result 
of the questionnaires would be compared with the well-known cases. The researcher anticipated 
obtaining the objective data of similarity level through doing this research.   
 
2.1 Subject 
 
     There were 140 questionnaires which were distributed, and the effective questionnaires were 
115. There were 55 product designers who have worked over 4 years in the filed of designing (48% 
of the total participants) and 60 ordinary consumers (52% of the total participants) in this study. The 
purpose was to identify the 5 well-known cases by the participants whether these cases infringed 
design patents or not. 
 4 
of identifying the infringement, the participants would be required to answer Yes or No if the 
judgement must make a decision of infringing the rights. 
 
3. Result 
 
     This study would try to quantify the level of plagiarism of the products’ similarity by the 
recognition of general public, and to compare with gender, education level, occupation and 
professional/unprofessional persons for recognizing the differences among these factors of the 
designing similarity.  
 
(1) Gender vs. Similarity level 
 
     The sample percentage between male and female was 62% (male) vs. 38% (female). 
Apparently, the samples of male identified the percentage of similarity which is lower than females’. 
In other words, males were easier to judge that there was a difference between the two samples, but 
females were easier to judge that the two samples were the same. 
 
(2) Education level vs. Similarity level 
 
     The most participants were bachelors, masters and doctors. However, the data was apparently 
high between the two samples from the participants who were at high school education level, and it 
showed the lower education levels which were easy to identify that the two samples were the same. 
In contrast, the differences between masters and doctors were close. 
 
(3) Occupation vs. Similarity level 
 
     The occupations could be categorized to Industrial, Business, Service, Government, and 
Student. However, the similarity data between the two samples was lower which judged by the 
participants who engaged in industrial, and the data of the rest occupation participants were not 
notable. 
 
(4) Professional/Non-professional person vs. Similarity level 
 
     The participants could be divided into Professional and Non-professional. The standard of 
dividing professional was the work experience years, professional persons required product 
designers who have worked over 4 years on designing, and non-professional person were ordinary 
consumers. The similarity data of judging the two samples was apparently lower by the professional 
participants, but the similarity data of judging the two samples by the non-professional ones was 
higher.

     The demandant, Elmer HTH company, held the U.S. design patent (The Patent Number: 
D290, 620). The car roof sign showed in the design patent’s picture which was a triangle-shape sign, 
there was a little bigger triangle round-shape angle which decorated at the down side of the 
triangle-shape sign. On the other hand, there was a thin triangle convex at the vertical edge of the 
sign, and there was a small round convex on the center of the top. The defendant, ICC company, 
pointed out the Elmer’s design patent that there were two differences among prior art and defendant 
company’s product. One is that there was a thin triangle convex at the vertical edge of the sign, and 
another one was that there was a small round convex on the center of the top. 
      
     The final judgement announced that ICC company did not infringe on Elmer’s design patent. 
The reason was that the product of defendant did not steal the two points of novelty of D290,620 
case. Although the demandant wanted to appeal to a higher court, the U.S. district court still 
identified the defendant’s product did not infringe on the design patent of demandant. The main 
reason was that the functional design was described in applying for a patent range when the 
demandant was applying for the patent (Elmer, 1995). 
 
(4) Case 4: Oddzon Products vs. Just Toy 
 
     The demandant, Oddzon Products, accused the Just Toy company’s product of infringing on 
the Oddzon Products’ Design patent which appealed to the U.S. district court in 1997. 
     
The final judgement announced that Just Toy company did not infringe on the design patent 
of Oddzon Products. The reason was that Oddzon company considered whether it infringed on 
design patent or not, it was not necessary to interpret the scope of Design patent. It was just only to 
compare with the designing of the product and design patent picture of the defendant; however, 
CAFC did not agree with demandant’s idea, CAFC considered whether a design patent was 
infringed by others or not, to compare with the designing of the product and design patent picture of 
the defendant was insufficient.    
 
(5) Case 5: Goodyear Tire vs. Hercules Tire 
 
     The demandant, Goodyear Tire, held the U.S. design patent of tire pattern (The Patent 
Number: D349,080). Hercules Tire made a new kind recap of tire pattern, and Hercules named it as 
“Power Trac” tire. Goodyear company appealed the patent infringement lawsuit to the U.S northern 
district court of Ohio. Goodyear company accused the Hercules company’s Power Trac tire of 
infringing on the D349,080 design patent of Goodyear company. 
 
     The final judgement announced that Hercules Tire did not infringed on the design patent of 
D349,080. The reason was that the court took the Power Trac tire to compare with the D349,080 
 8 
infringement could be sustained; there were 62 % of 115 participants who identified the 
infringement could not be sustained, and therefore obviously most participants identified the 
infringement could not be sustained in case 4. The result of testing and the result of judicial 
jugement were identical (The final judgement announced that the infringement was not 
sustained). The average data of the participants who identified case 4 infringement could be 
sustained were 82.8; The average data of the participants who identified case 4 infringement 
could not be sustained were 35.1. 
(5) Case 5: By examining the data of Case 5, there were 38 % of 115 participants who identified the 
infringement could be sustained; there were 61 % of 115 participants who identified the 
infringement could not be sustained, and therefore obviously most participants identified the 
infringement could not be sustained in case 5. The result of testing and the result of judicial 
jugement were identical (The final judgement announced that the infringement was not 
sustained). The average data of the participants who identified case 5 infringement could be 
sustained were 79.1; The average data of the participants who identified case 5 infringement 
could not be sustained were 39.9. 
 
     The results between the participants and the courts clearly were identical in 5 cases (Except 
for case 1, both were different).  
 
     The judgement reason of Case 1: Although the design of the defendant and the design patent 
of demandant were not exactly the same, the designing similarity level of the two products still 
made ordinary consumers, unspecific observers or the people who are interested in buying the 
products being confused, and could not identify the differences between the two products, and 
therefore the infringement was sustained. On the other hand, although the participants could 
identify the differences between the products, the participants may tell the little difference from the 
examination by comparing the one with another at the same time; therefore, the result would lead 
the most general public’s infringement judgements to be failed. The research showed that the 
judgements between the participants and the courts were not significant different by analyzing the 
data from Case 2 to Case 5. 
 
     To act a further step, the participants would made the infringement judgement being sustained 
when the participants identified that the similarity level of the two products was higher than 71%, 
and the participants would not made the infringement judgement being sustained when the 
participants identified that the similarity level of the two products was lower than 37%. The data 
showed if the judgements of the participants were consistent with the judgements of the courts 
(Except for Case 1), and both suit sides or the judge could provide the controversial item for the 
ordinary consumers to judge the infringement of similarity before acting lawsuits in the future. In 
other words, the consumers would made the infringement judgement being sustained when the 
consumers identified that the similarity level of the two products was higher than 71% or the 
 10
researcher decided to set up a prior process which was through examining the basic judgement of 
general public to do judgement, and the process could be a valued reference before acting any 
infringement lawsuits in the future.

on the brand would be gradually shaped that is the brand character resulting in engaged 
emotion developed between consumers and the brand (Aaker, 1997). Nevertheless, the brand 
reputation is not accumulated in a short period of time (Veloutsou etc., 2009) and brand belief 
does not occur overnight. It takes a long period of time for consumers to comprehend the 
spirit of the brand (Delgado-Ballester etc., 2001). 
 
Once the brand is shaped, it will become an intangible asset of the business. After consumers 
purchasing the products or services through the mark, image, or message of the brand, the 
brand has passes the value of the products or services to consumers (Yohn, 2010) so that 
consumers have obtained intangible feelings beyond the real products. When consumers are 
accumulating the positive impressions on the brand, the brand value is spontaneously formed. 
With the increase of brand value, it will become the support of the business (Gabay etc., 2009) 
and further accomplish the permanent asset (Johnson, 2003). Cotter (2005) indicated that 
trademark itself is the first step of establishing strong brand. In other words, brands with 
exclusive identification symbol in the beginning will become trademark. 
 
Brand image and consumers self-image are the key elements pushing the consuming 
behaviors of consumers (Parker, 2009) that the higher the brand name awareness appears, the 
more apparent the situation becomes. For this reason, some unworthy businesses tend to 
interfere the identification of consumers with similar brand symbols and attempt to result in 
confusing and mistaking (Mealema etc., 2010) so as to damage the rights and interests of 
consumers. 
 
A trademark is the label, symbol, sign, or the aggregation of the above that businesses use for 
honoring their products or service brands (Palumbo etc., 2000) to differentiate the products or 
services of the same type in the market and to help consumers identify products (Dukes, 
2004), understand the sources and features of products (Barnes, 2009), and publicize the 
businesses (Berkenstock, 2007). For this reason, a trademark is the guarantee of business 
reputation and product quality. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO, 2010) 
defined trademark in general that a trademark was to have the owner gain awareness and 
profits as well as to prevent dishonest competitors from selling products or services with 
similar trademark. 
 
What is more, since a trademark is the representative of a brand, the business is entitled to 
utilize it on the products or services that the right presents the monopoly (George, 2006). In 
this case, when consumers recognize a brand but associate it with another one, there might be 
an infringement act (Arvidsson, 2006).

The established trademark map in this study presents that f8 (Starbucks), f19 (AUTHOR), f21 
(E COFFEE), and f24 (Star coffee) has formed a trademark cluster of coffee shops that the 
similarity among the four trademarks is high in the respondents’ opinions. Nevertheless, the 
extent of infringement can be further studied by enlarging the values in the area that the 
research results are expected to provide judges of Intellectual Property with the important 
reference for determining infringement. 
 
What is more, since the infringement of trademark is determined by whether consumers 
would confuse or mistake the trademarks in the same type, businesses and designers can 
further establish the trademark map by themselves so that businesses can orientate their 
images with the trademark map to differentiate the image from their opponents. Besides, with 
the trademark map, designers can avoid the trademark designs infringing others trademarks. 
 
The trademark map established in this study is a pioneer which can help further studies on 
interpreting the infringement cases and establishing dynamic trademark map. The future 
research results can be widely applied to the judgments of infringements in judiciary, the 
orientation of images in businesses, as well as the design of trademark in design.
