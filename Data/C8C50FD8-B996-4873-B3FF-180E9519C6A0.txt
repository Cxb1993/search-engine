process [8]. Membrane fouling is characterized in 
general as a reduction of permeate flux through the 
membrane as a result of increased flow resistance due 
to pore blocking, concentration polarization, and cake 
formation [9-11]. The effect of these fouling 
mechanisms on flux decline depend on factors such as 
membrane pore size, solute loading and size 
distribution, membrane material and operating 
conditions, etc. [10].  Researchers have devised 
various strategies to reduce membrane fouling and to 
improve membrane cleaning efficiency for flux 
recovery. These strategies include development of 
new membrane materials [12, 13], new design of 
membrane module [10, 14, 15, 16], modification of 
feed flow pattern [17, 18], and incorporation of in situ 
or ex situ cleaning regimes in the membrane unit [19, 
20]. Sometimes, a combination of the various 
strategies may be employed in the same process [21]. 
Membrane fouling reduction strategies such as 
coagulation, flocculation, adsorption or ion exchange, 
have also been investigated. Recently, the use of 
synthetic poly-electrolytes as flocculants for 
suspended solids removal in wastewater treatment has 
grown rapidly [22,23]. The advantage of polymeric 
flocculants is their ability to produce large, dense, 
compact and stronger flocs with good settling 
characteristic compared to those obtained by 
coagulation. It can also reduce the sludge volume. 
Furthermore, the polymer performance is less 
dependent on pH and there are no residual or metal 
ions added such as Al3+ and Fe3+, and the alkalinity is 
maintained [24].  
One of the most commonly used polymeric 
flocculants is polyacrylamide (PAM). This is due to 
its versatility of being synthesized as positive, neutral 
or negatively charged flocculants that can be used to 
produce good settling performance at relatively low 
cost [24].  
It is therefore the objective of this study to utilize 
chemical flocculation using C-PAM (cationic 
polyacrylamide) as pre-treatment to hi-tech 
wastewater and to evaluate its efficiency in preventing 
membrane fouling in a submerged membrane 
bioreactor. A series of jar tests were performed to 
determine the optimum concentration of C-PAM and 
its effect on critical membrane flux and MFI potential 
in a submerged membrane bioreactor system was 
evaluated. 
 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Material 
Hi-tech wastewater collected from Taichung Industrial 
Science Park, Taichung, Taiwan was used in this 
study. The characteristics of the wastewater are 
presented in Table 1.

Cationic polyacrylamide (C-PAM) was used as 
coagulant in a submerged membrane bioreactor 
system. The membrane module used in this study was 
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). 
 
2.2. Experiments 
In this study, a batch type submerged membrane 
bioreactor system with and without adding C-PAM 
was used for hi-tech wastewater experiments under the 
same operating conditions. The schematic diagram of 
the membrane bioreactor system is shown in Figure 1. 
The PVDF hollow fiber membrane module was 
submerged in a 5L tank. A pressure gauge was 
mounted on the top of the membrane to measure the 
transmembrane pressure (TMP).  At the bottom of 
the tank, 3 air diffusers were connected to provide 
dissolved oxygen and to stir the mixed liquor. Sludge 
concentration was set at 4000 mg/L and 8000 mg/L 
while the C-PAM dose was varied using 1 ppm, 3 
ppm, and 7 ppm for each sludge concentration. The 
un-flocculated runs served as the control MBR. In this 
experiment, transmembrane pressure was measured 
quantitatively. The membrane bioreactor system was 
operated for four hours and the flux is varied every 40 
minutes.  
 
Fig. 1. Submerged MBR schematic diagram 
 
TMP was monitored every ten minutes.  After 4 
hours of operation, the reaction is stopped and the 
membrane modules were cleaned with 0.10% NaOCl 
in RO water for 6 hours. For each MBR filtration run, 
(8000 mg/L) sludge runs when C-PAM is increased 
from 1ppm to a maximum of 7ppm. This observation 
indicates that for low sludge concentrations, further 
addition of C-PAM will have little effect on the 
removal efficiencies while it has on the high sludge 
concentration runs. This also indicates that TCOD 
could be attributed largely on the action of 
microorganisms in the sludge and less likely from the 
addition of the C-PAM.

3.3 Effect of C-PAM dose on Particle size removal 
The particle size of the suspended matter plays a 
significant role in membrane filtration processes. One 
study on the relative contributions of SS, colloids, and 
dissolved molecules (DM) to the resistance to 
filtration caused by fouling were found to be 65%, 
30% and 5%, respectively [27].  To which, particle 
size distribution and concentration of small particles 
are found to be responsible for the reduction in flux 
recovery [28]. The effect of C-PAM dose on particle 
size reduction of the supernatant is shown in Fig. 5. 
The mean particle size shifted towards the smaller 
particle size region by as much as 89% and 95% with 
addition of just 1ppm of C-PAM for the 4000 mg/L 
and 8000 mg/L runs respectively. The maximum 
reduction in mean particle size occurred at the 
addition of 7ppm C-PAM, which are 97% (4000 mg/L) 
and 96% (8000 mg/L) and corresponds to the 
minimum particles sizes of 305 nm and 793 nm 
respectively. These particle size ranges are 2 times and 
7 times bigger than the pore size (0.10 µm) of the 
membrane filter used in this study. Hence this 
particles are not expected to enter and deposit inside 
the pores of the membrane to cause pore blocking, 
instead they may deposit on the membrane surface and 
form gel and cake layers which could lead to increase 
in membrane fouling resistance [29]. 
 
3.4 Effect of C-PAM dose on Zeta Potential  
The zeta potential of the particles was measured in 
order to predict the suitable conditions for the 
coagulation or flocculation to be efficient since it is 
mainly controlled by the interfacial forces. The 
magnitude of the zeta potential gives an indication of 
the potential stability of the colloidal system [30]. For 
the runs without C-PAM added, a high zeta potential 
measured (> 20 mV in absolute value) confirmed that 
the stability of the system was due to repulsive 
interactions that have to be screened for 
destabilization. The suspended particles are negatively 
charged and as expected, addition of the positively 
charged C-PAM coagulant resulted in a decrease in 
the absolute value of the zeta potential of the particles. 
The results of zeta potential measurements explain the 
effect C-PAM has on the turbidity, TCOD and mean 
particle size parameters. As the zeta potential is 
reduced, repulsive forces surrounding the suspended 
particles contributing to turbidity, TCOD and particle 
size are also reduced. This reduction in repulsive 
forces made it easier for the particles to coagulate and 
form larger flocs leaving a cleaner supernatant, which 
when analyzed, resulted in a better turbidity, TCOD 
and particle size removal. The increase of sludge 
concentration on the zeta potential values, however 
are negative. In the high (8000mg/L) runs, increasing 
C-PAM doses resulted in a reduction of zeta potential 
absolute values that are much lower than values 
obtained in the low (4000 mg/L) sludge concentration 
runs. This could be explained by the increase in 
negative charge contributed by increase in 
concentration of the negatively charged 
microorganisms. 
 
3.5. Effect of C-PAM on MFI-UF potential 
To investigate the effect of the sludge concentration 
and C-PAM dose on membrane fouling, MFI tests are 
performed in this study. In addition, to incorporate the 
smaller colloidal particles into the MFI measurement, 
the application of ultrafiltration (UF) membrane of 
pore size equal to 0.10 µm was used in this study to 
measure the particulate fouling potential of the 
wastewater and sludge mixture and the effect of 
increasing doses of C-PAM instead on the 
conventionally used membrane filter of pore size 
equal to 0.45 µm [31]. As expected, the MFI of the 
wastewater pretreated with C-PAM coagulant is 
greatly reduced as compared to the wastewater 
without pretreatment. In this study, MFI can be 
reduced to as much as 88% and 93% with 7ppm of 
C-PAM for 4000 and 8000 mg/L MLSS respectively. 
The effect of doubling the sludge concentration has a 
negative effect on the MFI reduction. This is expected 
and a result of increasing the amount of suspended 
matter that forms additional cake layer on the 
membrane surface that led to the increase in filtration 
resistance, hence, a corresponding increase in MFI.
