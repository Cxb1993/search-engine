前言+文獻探討 
Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is based on a decomposition derived from the 
data and is useful for the analysis of nonlinear and nonstationary time series signals 
[2]. With iterative decomposition of signals, EMD separates the full signal into 
ordered elements with frequencies ranged from higher to lower frequencies in each 
intrinsic mode function (IMF) level. EMD depends on the characteristics of the signal; 
therefore EMD behaves as a filter bank without a predefined cut-off frequency. This 
interesting property of EMD has been widely applied in biomedical signal analysis. 
EMD is also used for ECG noise reduction. Blanco-Velasco developed an 
EMD-based algorithm to remove the baseline wander and high-frequency noise of 
ECGs. Owing to the fact that the lower IMF levels correspond to higher frequency 
components and vice versa, reconstruction without the lower IMF level can remove 
highfrequency noise. Thus, low-frequency baseline wander can be removed by 
reconstruction without higher IMF levels. The major disadvantage of EMD is the 
so-called mode mixing effect. Ensemble EMD (EEMD) was introduced to remove the 
mode-mixing effect. The principle of the EEMD is to add white noise into the signal 
with many trials. The noise in each trial is different, and the added noise can be 
canceled out on average, if the number of trials is sufficient. Thus, as more and more 
trials are added to the ensemble, the residual part is the signal. During the ECG 
measurement, various types of noises, such as muscle noise, baseline wander, and 
power-line interferences, are recorded in the ECG signals, interfering with the 
ECG-information identification. Numerous signal-processing methods have been used 
on the studies of ECG noise reduction, especially on arrhythmia ECGs. Such as 
multichannel Wiener filter, adaptive LMS filter and time-frequency approach. 
 
研究目的、 
The goal of this study is to investigate EEMD based filtering performance and the 
corresponding phase delay of filtered signals in arrhythmia ECGs. Low pass, high 
pass and band pass filters were designed to meet various noises conditions: muscle 
contraction, 50 Hz power line and baseline wonder. Traditional Butterworth filter and 
Wiener filter was also used to compare the filtering performance. Phase distortion of 
the filtered ECG was also investigated. 
 
研究方法、 
A simulated arrhythmia ECG segment with designed noises was used to examine 
filter output. Noises contained EMG, 50 Hz power line and baseline wanders. Low 
ECG was filtered (reconstructed) with partial reconstruction IMF by EMD, EEMD 
respectively with following equation:

When k=1, q=n, RECG_emd1q becomes equivalent to the original noised ECG.  
A low pass filter was derived from deletion of lower IMF scale, than means k 
>1; A high pass filter was derived from deletion of high IMF scale, than means 
q <n; and a band pass filter was consequently with middle part of IMF scales, 
that means both conditions k >1 and q<n must be satisfied. The optimal choice 
of (k,q) pairs for each filter was determined with minimum MSE by sequential 
search approach.  
 
3.5. Filtering Performance Index 
MSE was to measure the difference between the original “clean” ECG and the 
reconstructed ECG. MSE is mainly from the residual noise and also ECG distortion 
after filtering process. MSE can be defined as follows:

結果與討論（含結論與建議） 
The trial number effect for EEMD is shown in table 1 and figure 1. The SNR 
effect is listed in table 2. MSE of synthetic noise for Arrhythmia ECG database is in 
table 3. MSE of real noises is in table 4 and table 5, for synthetic ECG and for 
Arrhythmia ECG database, respectively. 
 
 
 
 
Table 2, MSE value of standard ECG template with various SNR noise. Where EMD 
was with 100 times computation and EEMD was with trial number=100 and 10 dB  
added noise. W_100 means the FIR Wiener order with order 100. W_200 and W_300 
are with filter order 200 and 300, respectively.
