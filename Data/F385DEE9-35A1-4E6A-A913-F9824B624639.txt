The delay-and-add network leads to a recorded 
ENG amplitude which depends on the number of 
electrodes N, the velocity v to be recorded and on 
cuff geometry. For a single tripole the signal transfer 
characteristics is described by the relation 
mtrip V

sin4 2 ω=  ..(1) 
where Vtrip is the recorded voltage, A is a gain 
factor, ω is the frequency of the signal, d is the 
spacing between the electrodes and v is the velocity 
of the nerve signal. Extending this result to the MEC 
and using L to describe the length of the cuff leads to 
the following expression [3]:

II. Effect of time delays on noise 
When analyzing the noise from the system, many 
noise sources have to be considered in the 
resistances at the various sections of the cuff. Some 
of these produce outputs at one or more of the tripole 
amplifier outputs (TAO). For example resistive 
noise from one section of the cuff (measured 
between two adjacent electrodes) is amplified by 
three amplifiers in the double-differential 
arrangement. Because of the signs of these voltages, 
if there were no artificial delays, they would sum to 
zero at the final amplifier output. To find the power 
spectral density (PSD) when there are delays, it is 
necessary to know the PSD that results when white 
noise is added to itself after passing through a time 
delay. To minimize the amount of algebra, consider 
a general case of a noise source of amplitude α to 
which is added a fraction β delayed by τ, and a 
fraction γ delayed by 2τ, and a fraction ε delayed by 
3τ. The PSD is then

which can be used in the various cases that arise. 
For example, if α=1, β=-1 and γ=ε=0,

To apply this result to the MEC we make the 
following assumptions. 
• Each electrode can be represented by the 
electrode spreading resistance (Rs) from the 
volume of tissue (which may include some 
resistance for the metal tracks).  
• The interface reactance is small enough to be 
ignored at ENG frequencies. 
• The tissue within the cuff can be represented as 
an axial resistance (Re) between the end 
electrodes; the resistance from the end 
electrodes to the tissue outside the cuff is zero; 
and that the resistance from one end to the 
other outside is also zero. 
• Johnson (white) noise will originate in the 
resistances. 
• The input impedance of the first-rank 
amplifiers is approximately infinite. 
• The first-rank amplifiers have sufficient gain 
that the noise of the second-rank amplifiers is 
negligible. 
The considerations carried out in this project 
showed, that for the MEC for all but the first and last 
elements, α=1, β = -1, γ=ε= 0 and so Equation (6) 
applies. The two end sources contribute the noise of 
single resistors and so α=1, β=γ =ε = 0. The total 
noise power spectral density observed at the output 
is therefore:

IV. Practical evaluation 
The test setup shown in Fig. 6 was used to evaluate 
a practical arrangement for the recording of action 
potentials. The core of the setup is the MEC and the 
amplifier bank connected to it. In addition, a 
stimulation cuff was used to electronically excite the 
nerve with a bipolar hook electrode (manufactured 
using 0.1mm diameter platinum wire). ENG was 
recorded in the manner of Erlanger and Gasser [5]. 
The experiment was successful, and a clear picture 
of the potentials could be recorded as shown in Fig. 
7.

V. Conclusions 
We have examined the noise performance of the 
MEC especially with regards to its application in 
velocity-selective nerve recording. It is found that 
the thermal noise generated by sections of the cuff 
contribute to more than one output of the double 
differential channels. Due to the introduced time 
delay, interference effects arise between the noise 
components of the channels. It is shown, that the 
observed total noise PSD depends on the MEC 
dimension and the action-potential velocity for 
which the MEC is tuned. It was further demonstrated, 
that the MEC noise performance is superior to that 
of a tripole at low recording velocities, establishing a 
significantly wider recording band. Practical 
performance was evaluated and measured results for 
a MEC are presented. This project has lead to 
contributions to 5 peer-reviewed publications: [2, 6-
9].
