二、英文摘要 
IR drop noise has become a critical issue in advanced 
process technologies. Traditionally, timing analysis in 
which the IR drop noise is considered assumes a worst-case 
IR drop for each gate; however, using this assumption 
provides unduly pessimistic results. In this project, we 
describe a timing analysis approach for power gating 
designs. To improve the accuracy of the gate delay 
calculation we determine the virtual voltage level by taking 
into account the IR drop waveforms across the sleep 
transistors. These can be obtained efficiently using a linear 
programming approach. Our experimental results are very 
promising. 
 
三、計畫緣由與目的 
As the VLSI design process continues to scale down, 
the noise problem has become critical because it may 
degrade a circuit’s performance and cause erroneous output 
values. Supply and reference voltage fluctuations are a 
source of IR drop noise. Traditionally, after the worst-case 
IR drop is determined, it is used by the timing analyzer to 
estimate a circuit’s delay; however, using the worst-case IR 
drop can provide unnecessarily pessimistic results. Because 
IR drop depends on the applied input vectors, IR drop 
varies over time and is different for different nodes on the 
power grid. It is also well known that the worst cases of IR 
drop only occur occasionally.  
There have been several previous works 
[1][3][5][11][14] that address timing analysis with IR drop 
noise. Researchers [1][14] consider the variations of both 
power and ground voltages. The authors of [5] calculate 
circuit delay with IR drop noise by modeling it as an 
effective output load. Researchers in [11] provide a pattern 
searching technique for producing the worst-case delay on 
the critical paths. The authors of [3] present a 
pattern-independent method to calculate a tight upper 
bound on the delay along the selected path with IR drop 
noise. 
 Unlike previous works that focus on the IR drop of a 
power grid network, we studied the IR drop effect in a 
power gating design [2][7][12][13][16][17] in which the IR 
drop problem is even more severe. Power gating is used 
extensively in portable devices for leakage power 
reduction. Since the on resistances of the sleep transistors 
are relatively larger than the resistances of wires, currents 
may flow through the sleep transistors and cause larger IR 
drops across sleep transistors in the active mode. For 
example, the on resistance with 1 um width is 2499 Ohm 
for a sleep transistor, but the sheet resistance is 0.06 Ohm 
for a Metal 1 wire, which increases the severity of the IR 
drop. Hence, analyzing the timing with IR drop is very 
important in the power gating designs.

requires a massive number of circuit-level simulations. The 
process becomes impractical even for a medium-sized 
design. Although MCSTi(t) is difficult to calculate, the 
maximum current of a cluster Ci, defined as MCCi(t), is 
quite easy to obtain. Many efficient methods have been 
proposed in [6][8][9][10]. In addition, CAD tools such as 
PrimePower™ are available, which enable us to perform a 
massive number of gate-level simulations to obtain the 
maximum current of a cluster.  
In this project, we assume that the maximum currents 
for the clusters are available. One simple way of estimating 
the maximum current through the sleep transistors, MCSTi, 
is to plug the maximum cluster current, MCCi, into its 
corresponding variable ICi in EQ(1). However, this simple 
estimation is unduly pessimistic because the maximum 
currents of different clusters usually do not occur 
simultaneously.  
I.2. IR Drop Waveform Estimation without 
decaps 
Now, we formally formulate the problem of deriving 
IR drop waveforms for all nodes on the virtual power grid 
as shown in Figure 3. The input is a resistive network that 
models the sleep transistors and wire segments of the 
virtual power line. In addition, we assume that the 
waveforms of the clusters’ maximum currents are available. 
Our objective is to find an accurate estimation of the sleep 
transistors’ IR drop waveforms.  
 We have noted that the maximum currents of 
different clusters usually do not occur at the same time; 
however, the maximum current for a cluster, MCCi(t), can 
only be used to constrain the value of the corresponding ICi. 
For the correlation between different clusters, we can use 
the maximum current of different combinations of clusters 
to constrain the current through the corresponding clusters. 
For example, we can obtain MCC1,C2(t), which is the 
maximum current of the two clusters: C1 and C2. With 
MCC1,C2(t), we must have IC1 + IC2 ≤ MCC1,C2(t). Our idea is 
to use such maximum currents as linear constraints to 
consider the correlations between different clusters and also 
to obtain MIRSTi(t) by maximizing the value of IRSTi, which 
is the IR drop across the sleep transistor STi. Taking RST1 in 
Figure 3 as an example, the linear program to find the 
MIRST1(t) for a time instance t can be stated as follows: 
Maximize 
 
 
Subject to 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where r11, r12, and r13 are constants.  
The linear programming solution can efficiently find 
the waveform of MIRSTi and take into account that the 
maximum currents for the clusters do not occur 
simultaneously.  
I.3. IR Drop Waveform Estimation with Decaps 
Since decaps are commonly inserted between the 
ground and virtual power lines in a power gating design to 
prevent a sudden fluctuation of IR drops and to reduce the 
IR drop noise, it is important to consider their effect. In the 
previous section, we modeled the sleep transistor network 
as a linear system without considering decaps. In this 
section, we discuss how to modify the linear programming 
model to consider the effect of decaps.  
The circuit used for this problem is shown in Figure 4. 
Here, CDi represents the capacitance of a decap Di. Again, 
we assume that the current profiles of all clusters are 
available. 
With decaps, the value of the IR drop across a sleep 
transistor depends not only on the current flowing through 
the sleep transistor, but also on the previous voltages across 
the decaps. Because of this dependency, the linear 
programming solution in EQ(3) cannot be directly applied.

divide the gate’s switching windows into a set of small 
periods, called slices. The set of slices obtained for one gate 
is the sliced switching window.  
With the IR drop waveform for a gate, we have 
information about the largest IR drop within each time 
slice. For example, in Figure 6, the largest IR drop within 
the slice [400, 500] is 0.082 V. For each slice in the 
switching window of a gate, we use its largest IR drop for 
computing the corresponding IR drop noise induced delay 
by applying the methods described in [1][14]. When the 
noise delays of all slices have been obtained, we can 
determine the gate’s delay.  
We use an example to illustrate the computation of the 
IR drop noise delay on a slice of a switching window. 
Suppose the IR drop waveform of a gate under 
consideration is as shown in Figure 6. Without considering 
the IR drop noise, the gate’s switching window is [400, 
700]. We divide the switching window of the gate into 
three slices {[400, 500], [500, 600], [600, 700]} of equal 
size: 100 ps. The largest IR drops of the gate are 0.082 V, 
0.074 V, and 0.051 V within these three slices. For the first 
slice [400, 500], we use the IR drop noise of 0.075 V to 
calculate the delay Δd1. The first slice is then extended to 
be [400, 500+Δd1] when considering the IR drop noise. 
Similarly, for the other two slices, we have [500, 600+Δd2] 
and [600, 700+Δd3]. In this example, suppose the 
maximum value among {500+Δd1, 600+Δd2, 700+Δd3} is 
600+Δd2. Since the largest delay now is 600+Δd2, the 
gate’s switching window can be extended to [400, 
600+Δd2]. If we consider [400, 700] as a basic unit, the 
largest IR drop within the switching window is 0.082 V, 
which is less than the peak IR drop of 0.098V. Then, the 
switching window considering the IR drop noise will be 
[400, 700+Δd]; Δd is the noise delay under a 0.082 V IR 
drop. When we get the whole picture of the updated slices, 
we can easily obtain the delay for the entire circuit. 
五、實驗結果 
We implemented the algorithms in sections I and II and 
applied them to several benchmark circuits using the 
TSMC 90 nm CMOS technology process. These circuits 
were implemented using the power gating design style 
[2][7][12][13].  
In our experimental flow, first, a benchmark circuit is 
synthesized and placed. After that, we group the gates in 
the same row into a cluster that connects to a sleep 
transistor. Figure 7 shows a partial layout of C5315. The 
sleep transistors are inserted on the side of a row and 
underneath a power trunk. The decaps are placed near each 
sleep transistor and the value of a decap is assumed to be 
0.5 pF. Then, we generated maximum current waveforms 
of clusters by using PrimePower™ with 10,000 random 
vectors. 
In the TSMC 90 nm process, the on resistance of a 
1μm sleep transistor is 2499 Ohm but the resistance of a 
1μm Metal 1 wire is only 0.3 Ohm. The resistance of a wire 
is relatively small compared to the on resistance of a sleep 
transistor. Therefore, without losing much accuracy in the 
estimation, the IR drop of a node on the virtual power grid 
can be obtained from the IR drop of the node’s 
corresponding sleep transistor. For instance, in Figure 8, 
the IR drop waveform of node G1 can be obtained from the 
IR drop waveform of the sleep transistor ST1. 
Table 1 shows the results of our experiments. Column 
1 shows the name of a benchmark circuit. Column 2 shows 
the number of sleep transistors. Column 3 shows a circuit’s 
delay without IR drop noise. In an IR drop waveform, the 
peak IR drop denotes the largest value of the IR drop 
waveform. We use the peak IR drop as a constant for the 
whole cycle to pessimistically estimate the noise delay and 
report the noise delay, shown in Column 4. Note that the 
noise delay is the difference of a circuit’s delay with noise 
minus a circuit’s delay without noise. We then estimate a
