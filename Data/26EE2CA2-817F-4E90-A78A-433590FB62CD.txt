Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) belongs to a family of microbial energy and carbon 
storage compounds collectively known as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). They can be 
accumulated by many bacteria under unfavorable growth conditions. These polyesters 
have properties similar to those of polypropylene and are significant because they are 
completely biodegradable. Due to its potential application in the medicine, agriculture 
and marine fields, the production of PHB by microorganism has received much 
attention in recent years. Fed-batch fermentation is commonly used to prevent or 
reduce substrate-associated growth inhibition by controlling nutrient supply. However, 
without a proper feeding strategy this fermentation would not result in much higher 
productivity than batch fermentation. Therefore, in this report we investigated optimal 
control strategies for PHB production in fed-batch fermentation. A fed-batch 
mathematical model of PHB synthesis in Ralstonia eutropha is developed and 
validated against experimental data before it is incorporated into the optimal control 
computation. The optimal operation profiles are obtained from the dynamic 
optimization based on the hybrid differential evolution (HDE) algorithm. Then PHB 
productivity is controlled by manipulating the nutrient feeding. Unmeasured 
stochastic disturbances are imposed to study trajectory tracking control. The control 
design is based on the configuration of nonlinear model predictive control. The results 
indicate that the proposed approach presents the satisfactory compromise between 
robustness and efficiency.

Abstract 
 
Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) belongs to a family of microbial energy and 
carbon storage compounds collectively known as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). 
They can be accumulated by many bacteria under unfavorable growth conditions. 
These polyesters have properties similar to those of polypropylene and are significant 
because they are completely biodegradable. Due to its potential application in the 
medicine, agriculture and marine fields, the production of PHB by microorganism has 
received much attention in recent years. Fed-batch fermentation is commonly used to 
prevent or reduce substrate-associated growth inhibition by controlling nutrient supply. 
However, without a proper feeding strategy this fermentation would not result in 
much higher productivity than batch fermentation. Therefore, in this paper we 
investigate optimal control strategies for PHB production in fed-batch fermentation. A 
fed-batch mathematical model of PHB synthesis in Ralstonia eutropha is developed 
and validated against experimental data before it is incorporated into the optimal 
control computation. The optimal operation profiles are obtained from the dynamic 
optimization based on the hybrid differential evolution (HDE) algorithm. Then PHB 
productivity is controlled by manipulating the nutrient feeding. Unmeasured 
stochastic disturbances are imposed to study trajectory tracking control. The control 
design is based on the configuration of nonlinear model predictive control. The results 
indicate that the proposed approach presents the satisfactory compromise between 
robustness and efficiency.

A culture of Ralstonia eutropha with fructose as the carbon source and ammonium 
sulfate as the nitrogen source are used in this study (Shahhosseini, 2004). 
Fermentations are carried out in a fed-batch reactor. Development of the reactor 
model was based on the assumption: biomass is composed of two components that are 
residual biomass and product PHB. The term residual biomass denotes the total mass 
of cells minus their PHB content. The mass balances for the concentrations of residual 
biomass, PHB, the carbon substrate and the nitrogen substrate for fed-batch 
fermentation in a well-mixed bioreactor may be written as follows (Shahhosseini, 
2004).

 Many kinetic models have been proposed for the specific growth rate. They 
range from the relatively simple models to the rather complex models as shown in 
Table 1. From a practical perspective, a model should be simple enough for easy 
validation and implementation, and sufficiently detailed to contain all the important 
features. Thus, this is a trade-off problem. An optimal estimation of model parameters 
is used to minimize the deviations between the model predictions and the 
experimental data. The experimental data is adopted from the recent work of 
Shahhosseini (2004). The optimization program for the direct search of the minimum 
Ralstonia eutropha, we consider a constant flow rate used for fructose feeding with 
240 g/L at 0.0025 L/h and a varying flow rate used for ammonium sulfate feeding 
with 18.1239 g/L. The performance index for this problem is

NF  is also constrained within 0 0.01 L/hNF≤ ≤   . The constraint on the concentration 
of ammonium sulfate, , is .  NS 0.05 g/LNS ≥   
 The optimal feed rate profiles of ammonium sulfate are calculated by the HDE 
optimization by imposing N time segments. Here each time segment is set 60/N hrs 
and the flow rate is constant within the time segment. The optimal fructose and 
ammonium sulfate concentration profiles and the corresponding optimal feed rate 
profiles are determined and shown in figures 4, 5, 6, and 7. As seen in these figures, 
the final PHB concentrations go up to 5.64 g/L. The detailed information is described 
in Table 3.  
 
4. Optimal Control 
Previously, the study of optimal feed rates was restricted to the cultivation without 
model mismatch and parameter variation. Process variability and uncertainty are 
inevitable. Now the control of bioreactors based on the flow rate profiles of substrate 
becomes an interesting problem from implementation and controller design points of 
view. The present works adopt the concepts of NMPC (nonlinear model predictive 
control) algorithms and apply to the above-mentioned PHB cultivation process where 
the optimal profiles of residual biomass, PHB, fructose, and ammonium sulfate are 
Figure 9 shows the simulation results for the case of the time segment of 3 hours. As 
can be seen, our proposed controller provides a high level of closed-loop performance 
in the tracking control problem. A comparison of the effectiveness of control is 
summarized and shown in Table 4. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, the sum of square of errors between four specific growth models and 
experimental data are calculated to search for the best goodness-of-fit. The goodness- 
of-fit criterion and the visual comparison of the fed-batch model profile and 
experimental data indicates that the model considers the effect of carbon and nitrogen 
sources limitations and inhibitions, and is able to explain the observed experimental 
kinetics much better. The model is further used to investigate the problems of optimal 
flow rates and control. A maximum productivity approach is used to optimize the 
feeding rates of the limiting nutrient. Then, a model-based optimal control strategy is 
proposed to deal with the tracking problem of optimal profiles. It is shown that the 
proposed NMPC can successfully control a non-linear bioreactor to track the optimal 
profiles that resulted in optimal nutrient feeding based on the hybrid differential 
evolution (HDE) algorithm.
