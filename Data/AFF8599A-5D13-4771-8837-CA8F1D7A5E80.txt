In this report, the Reynolds type equation derived by Zhang and Umehara[10] , which included 
the effect of electrical double layer, as well as the ‘half wetting bearing’ concept proposed by 
Spike will be combined to derive a new Reynolds type equation.  The new Reynolds type 
equation is based on the experience learned from the executed project in previous year.  The 
effects of Navier slip and EDL will be considered in the derivation.  The lubrication 
performance of the one dimensional slider bearing is then discussed for various slip parameters 
and EDL parameters.  The results show that the existence of EDL resists the flow, whereas the 
existence of Navier-slip enhances the flow.

In Fig.3, the Poiseuille velocity flow are plotted as functions of K (inverse Debye Length).  The 
inverse Debye length is function of the concentration of electrolete, temperature, and charge 
number.  As the inverse Debye length decrease, the EDL effects increase.  The effects of EDL 
saturated as the inverse Deybe length increases further.

Also, the load capacities are plotted as functions of viscosity ratio for various combinations of 
slip parameters, i.e. Fig.6.  As the slip parameters increases, the flow increases, and thus the 
load capacity decreases.

Conclusion 
The present project derived a modified Reynolds equation which account the combined effects of 
Navier slip and EDL.  The results show that the parameters are of significant effects on the flow, 
and thus the load carrying capacities.
