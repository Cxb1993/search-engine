solution coexists with the HCP α phase of 
the Mg solid solution. As the amount of Li 
added to the Mg−Li alloy increases, the α 
phase still possesses HCP structure, but the 
crystal lattice axes ratio, c/a decreases such 
that slip between crystal planes become less 
difficult [2], the coexistence of the β phase 
makes the Mg−Li alloy possible to be cold 
worked. The β single phase structure could 
exist in Li contents greater than 11 wt%. 
However, the mechanical properties of 
Mg−Li alloys are not particularly favorable 
for structural applications due to its low 
tensile and yield strength. Various third 
elements have been added to the Mg−Li 
alloy systems to explore the effect of the 
addition of a third element on the 
mechanical properties and formability [3-5]. 
Strain hardening behavior is one of the 
important considerations in evaluating plastic 
deformation of materials [6], and the 
strain-hardening exponent is also the most 
important factor that influences stretchability, 
when stretching dominates in the forming 
processes [7,8]. The strain hardening behavior 
of cubic metals is fairly well understood and 
accumulation of a forest of dislocations is the 
dominant hardening mechanism [9,10]. 
Hexagonal metals present a more complex case 
due to their low symmetry, which restricts the 
number of slip systems [9], and their strong 
plastic anisotropy. 
  In the present work, an Mg–Li–Al–Zn 
alloy (designated as LAZ) containing about 
10wt% of Li was chosen as the matrix alloy. 
Main emphasis was placed on investigating 
the effect of thermomechanical treatment on 
the strain-hardening behavior and formabili- 
ty of the LAZ alloy containing minor Sc. 
 
2. Materials and Experimental 
Procedures 
 
2.1 Alloys 
 
The Mg–Li alloy was melted in a 
high-vacuum electric induction furnace 
under an argon atmosphere and then cast 
into an ingot with a cylindrical shape of 200 
mm in diameter and 400 in mm height. The

analyzed chemical composition of the cast 
alloy by use of an induction coupled plasma 
(ICP) and Spark Optical Emission 
Spectrometry (Spark-OES) apparatuses is 
given in Table 1. The cylindrical ingots were 
then extruded into a plate of 110 mm in 
width and 10 mm in thickness at a billet 
preheating temperature of 200°C. 
 
2.2 thermomechanical processing 
 
The as-extruded specimen for alloy 
LAZ1010Sc was annealed at 300°C for 1 h 
followed by quenching. The annealed 
specimen was cold rolled with the 
reductions of 20, 40, 60, and 80%. 
Reference specimens for comparison were 
directly cold rolled from the extruded plate 
with the same reductions as used for the 
annealed specimens to explore the effect of 
annealing heat treatment on cold working. 
 
2.3. Tensile Tests 
 
Uniaxial tension test was carried out in 
the direction along the extrusion and rolling 
direction. The gauge length and width of the 
tensile specimen were 50 and 6 mm, 
respectively. The specimens were tested at 
room temperature with initial strain rates of 
1.67 × 10-3 and 3.34×10

. 
 
2.4 Press forming tests 
 
The press forming tests were performed at 
room temperature and the punch speeds 
were kept constants at 6 and 30 mm/min 
during the tests. The sheet length for press 
forming test to determine the FLD was 100 
mm with various width. Decreasing the 
width from 100 to 10 mm causes change in 
the state of strain from near balanced-biaxial 
tension through plane strain to uniaxial- 
tension. Two sets of samples were prepared

that LAZ1010Sc alloy could be work

annealing treatment, the strain hardening 
rates with reductions below 40% are higher 
than those of the specimens without a prior 
annealing treatment. Therefore, a prior 
annealing treatment could enhance strain 
hardening effect for LAZ1010Sc alloy.

The strain-hardening of a material after 
yielding is related to the dislocation strain 
field interactions. Thus the Taylor 
dislocation contribution σd = MηGbρ
1/2
 
dominates the strain hardening effect; where 
ρ is the dislocation density, η is a constant, 
M is the Taylor factor, G is the shear 
modulus and b is the Burgers vector. Stress 
contribution due to dislocation density can 
be obtained by subtracting the yield stress 
from the total flow stress and can be written 
as ρ1/2 ∝ σd = σ-Y [13]. Then the applied 
stress necessary to deform a material is 
proportional to the dislocation density inside 
the material resulting in a high and nearly 
constant strain-hardening rate (i.e. stage II 
linear hardening effect). However, the cold 
worked specimens in the present study do 
not exhibit any stage II linear hardening 
behavior, and their stage III with a 
decreasing Θ occurs immediately after 
yielding, as shown in Fig. 5. The dominant 
slip system in Mg and Mg alloys at room 
temperature is the basal one. The activity of 
non-basal slip systems plays an important 
role in softening. Addition of Li may result 
in higher activity of non-basal slip [14]. 
Screw component of a (basal) dislocations 
in the basal planes may move on the prism 
planes [15]. Therefore, the free path of 
dislocations increases and strain hardening 
rate decreases. This could be the reason for 
the occurrence of stage III strain hardening 
after yielding in the LAZ1010 alloy due to 
easy cross-slip. 
As stage III appears to approach a 
saturation level, the new stage IV gets 
involved when the hardening rate Θ has 
dropped to a particular low level. Stage IV 
has been found in some polycrystalline 
metals [16,17]. Sevillano et al. [18] 
postulated that Θ decreased continuously in 
stage IV and that it was terminated by 
damage accumulation, eventually leading, at 
the end of stage IV, to failure and a 
corresponding drop of Θ. Rollett et al. [19] 
proposed that the hardening rate in stage IV 
was governed by debris accumulation in the 
cell walls. While in the major part of stage 
III the net rate of dislocation accumulation

determined by experiments are tabulated in 
Table 4. A metal sheet with a higher value 
of r  (normal anisotropy) could promote 
good deep-drawability [20], and a higher ∆r 
value (planar anisotropy) would increase the 
tendency of ear formation during drawing 
operation. Both the r  value and its ∆r 
value are highly dependent upon texture, or 
preferred orientation [21]. Higher r value 
was observed in the TD.

 are 1.876 and

respectively. In the study demonstrated by 
Chino et al. [22], a rolled sheet with a low r 
value corresponds to enhancement of 
thickness direction strain. Therefore, the 
stretchability of the RD sample should be 
better than that of the TD sample. A higher n 
value was also observed in the RD. As 
reported in the literatures [20,23], when 
stretching predominates in the forming 
processes, n is the most important factor that 
influences stretchability and the metals 
having a high n value represent greater 
stretchability. The RD sample shows not 
only a lower r value but also a higher n 
value indicating that the stretchability of the 
RD sample should be better than that of the 
TD sample at room temperature and at a 
strain rate of 1.67×10

r value could improve the stretchability, it 
would exhibit lower deep drawability.

4. Conclusions 
 
The effects of thermal and mechanical 
treatments on the strain-hardening behaviors 
and formability of an Mg−Li−based alloy 
containing minor addition of Sc were 
investigated in this study. The LAZ1010Sc 
alloy sheets did not exhibit any stage II 
linear hardening behavior, and their stage III 
with a decreasing strain-hardening rate 
occurred immediately after yielding. The 
activation of non-basal slip and cross-slip 
should be the reason to suppress the stage II 
hardening behavior.  
Increase in the deformation rate, which 
would increase the n value and decrease 
r-value, could improve the stretchability; on 
the contrary, decrease in r-value revealed 
that increase in deformation rate would not 
favor the drawability. Higher n values and 
lower r-values were observed in the RD 
samples. Therefore, the RD samples 
exhibited higher stretchability and the TD 
samples revealed higher drawability. At a 
higher punch speed of 30 mm/min during 
press forming, the decrease in r  value and 
the increase in average n value, when 
compared with the samples deformed at a 
lower punch speed of 6 mm/min, resulted in 
an enhanced stretchability.

Abstract—A series of experiments were performed by use of 
stepwise pressurization profiles for gas blow forming of an Mg 
alloy with a male die. Decreasing the forming time for gas blow 
forming of a commercially available fine-grained Mg alloy 
AZ31B thin sheet with a thickness of 0.6 mm has been studied in 
the present work. The results indicated that it was feasible to 
form a shallow rectangular pan with a height of 10 mm in less 
than 320 sec. The distribution of thickness along the transverse 
cross section of the formed pan was confirmed by the results as 
being sensitive to the pressurization profiles. Grain growth was 
not a serious problem for forming at a temperature of 370°C. 
Grain size increased from about 5.1 μm to a maximum size of 
about 7.1 μm. The maximum cavity volume fraction in the 
formed pan was about 1.1% for two different pressurization 
profiles.

I. INTRODUCTION 
  Magnesium is the lightest metal that can be used in 
structural applications when alloyed with other elements. 
Research on Mg alloy focusing on mechanical properties has 
become very active in the past decade [1]–[3]. In recent 
years, die casting of Mg alloys has been developed for 
electronic appliances and automotive components [4], [5]. 
However, casting is not an ideal process in manufacturing 
thin-walled Mg components due to its low yield and low 
good rates. A potential solution would be to turn to the sheet 
forming processes. 
In light of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure, Mg 
and its alloys have crucial drawback of poor formability, 
especially at room temperature, than aluminum and its alloys. 
Therefore, sheet metal forming operation for Mg alloy would

be generally carried out at temperatures up to 300 °C [6]. In 
order to improve the formability of the Mg alloy thin sheet, 
the fine-grained (less than 10 μm) AZ31B Mg alloy has been 
developed and is commercially available. Components using 
the fine-grained AZ31B alloy sheet could be manufactured 
either by press forming or superpplastic gas blow forming 
process. Fine-grained AZ31B alloy requires careful process 
control to maintain the desired constant strain rate during 
superplastic forming. The strain rates are typically very low 
compared with most metal forming processes. A significant 
problem in commercial applications of superplastic forming 
with AZ31B alloy is the low forming rates (10-3-10-4 s-1), 
which is undesirable in a manufacturing process for mass 
production. In order to meet the need for industrial 
applications, it is necessary to increase the forming rate 
during gas blow forming. 
The present work has explored the deformation 
characteristics of a commercial grade fine-grained AZ31B 
alloy during gas blow forming by use of rapid pressurizing 
profiles with the intention of reducing forming time. Gas 
pressure forming was performed to deform the sheet into a 
male die cavity to form a rectangular shaped pan. 
Backpressure and lubricant were not used during forming. 
Effects of pressurization profiles on the formability were 
studied. Experimental results were quantitatively analyzed 
and the results were presented. 
 
II. MATERIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
POSCO Company, Korea, provided the Mg alloy 
AZ31B-O thin sheet with a thickness of 0.6 mm used in this 
work. The analyzed chemical composition was (wt-%) 
Mg-3.01Al-0.98Zn-0.32Mn. The average grain size was 
about 5.1 μm before forming. The optical image of the 
microstructure of sheet is presented in Fig. 1. The sheet was 
formed into a rectangular shaped male die cavity by 
compressed gas. The dimensions of the formed rectangular 
pan were 70 mm (length) × 40 mm (width) × 10 mm (height); 
as shown in Fig.2. Gas blow forming was carried out at a 
lower die temperature of 370°C and an upper die temperature 
of 240°C according to the pressure-time profiles shown in 
Fig. 3. The terms PT320 and PT240 used in the present paper 
refer to the pressurization profiles for the forming periods of 
320 and 240 sec, respectively. The pressurization profiles 
used in this work did not result in constant strain rates as the 
deformation proceeded; the strain rate changed with time

restricted, and thinning is localized in the non-contact areas 
resulting in a greater degree of thinning. Major thinning 
effect takes place at the non-contact region of the sheet in the 
later stage of forming, therefore, more significant thinning 
was observed on the side wall region. 
Thickness values on the top plane of the formed pans are 
about 0.58-0.59 mm and 0.57-0.58 mm for forming at 
pressurization profiles of PT240 and PT320, respectively. 
For fast gas blow forming, the imposed external pressure has 
a significant effect on the interfacial friction between 
deformed sheet and the die surface. The imposed pressures 
for forming at a pressurization of PT240 are much greater 
than those of PT320, a higher imposed pressurization profile 
results in a higher interfacial friction to reduce the thinning 
effect on the top plane of the formed pan in a male die 
forming. 
B. Grain Size Distribution 
A plot of the distribution of grain size is given in Fig. 6. It 
indicates that grain growth did occur during forming. 
Different distributions of grain size were observed for 
forming at different pressurization profiles. Grain growth 
should be related to the amount of deformation and 
temperature in the deformed sheet. In this study, the upper die 
temperature is lower than that of lower die. As the sheet is 
loaded, the sheet sits on the top surface of the lower male die 
and is heated up by the lower die. At the time when the dies 
are closed, the periphery of the sheet will be cooled down due 
to a lower upper die temperature. Therefore, a temperature 
gradient will exist during forming. Grain growth in the side 
wall region should be resulted from strain-induced grain 
growth due to a higher deformation in the side wall with a 
lower temperature. The grain growth observed in the top 
plane of the formed pan should be the result caused by the 
static grain growth due to a higher temperature in this region. 
The thinning effect in the top plane of the formed pan is small 
than that in the side wall, however, the grain size in the top 
plane region is greater than that in the side wall region. This 
result reveals that static grain growth is the major factor to 
cause grain growth during fast gas blow forming. 
  Fig. 6 also shows that the locations with maximum grain 
size are different for forming at different pressurization 
profiles. The maximum grain size locates at position 3 which 
is the thinnest position of the pan formed at a pressurization 
profile of PT320. The forming time for forming at a 
pressurization profile of PT320 is longer than that of PT240 
reducing the temperature gradient across the sheet during 
forming. The temperature at position 3 for forming at a 
pressurization profile of PT320 should be higher than that for 
forming at a pressurization of PT240, both static and 
strain-induced grain growth should have taken place at 
position 3 for forming at a pressurization of PT320 resulting 
in a larger grain size. 
C. Cavity Distribution 
Fig. 7 displays the distribution of cavity volume fraction of 
the formed pan. It shows that the distributions of cavity 
volume fraction are not much different for forming at two 
different pressurization profiles. The maximum cavity 
volume fraction is about 1.1% for both pressurization 
profiles, indicating that cavitation is not a serious problem in 
this study. Cavitation in the fine-grained alloys during gas 
blow forming should be related to the strain rate, stress state, 
strain and grain size [7]–[9]. In this study, no obvious 
relationship between cavity level and the parameters 
mentioned above was observed. In general, the cavity level 
increases with grain size. A more detailed study should be 
performed to clarify the cavitation behavior of the 
fine-grained AZ31B Mg alloy during fast gas blow forming 
using a male die. 
D. Thickness Evolution during Forming 
Fig. 8 depicts the evolution of thickness at different 
locations of the deformed sheet with forming time at two 
different pressurization profiles. For forming at a 
pressurization profile of PT320, the thickness at position 7 in 
the top plane decreases with increasing forming time, reaches 
a thickness of about 0.57 mm at a forming time of around 150 
sec and then remains constant, as shown in Fig 8(a). Similar 
resul t  was  a lso  observed a t  posi t ion 2  near  the
