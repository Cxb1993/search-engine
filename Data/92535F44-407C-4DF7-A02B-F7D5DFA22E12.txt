中文摘要： 
本計畫為一年期的個別型研究計畫，主要的是研製一個可應用於無座標資訊
感測網路的訊息傳遞系統。本計畫以平坦（Flat）網路架構觀點設計一個稱為
PGRP（Probabilistic Geocast Routing Protocol）的地域性群播繞徑協定，主要工
作項目包含訊息轉傳決策之分析與設計。本計畫網路模型中的 Sensor Node位置
是以距離及方向碼做為表示，其中距離是指該 Sensor Node到 Sink的 Hop Count，
而方向碼則是根據虛擬座標（Virtual Coordinate）系統使用的格雷碼（Gray Code）
編碼方式產生。PGRP的主要運作概念為距離目的地方向區域越遠的 Sensor Node
具有較低的封包轉傳機率，即利用 Sensor Node 方向與距離兩項轉傳機率計算
Sensor Node的最終轉傳機率，有效的限制封包的轉傳範圍以減少不必要的封包
傳送，降低 Sensor Node不必要的電量消耗以增加網路的存活時間。為了驗證提
出的方法之效能，我們以 ns2進行模擬，從我們的模擬結果可以發現，由於 PGRP
可根據 Sensor Node所在方向與距離動態調整轉送封包的機率，因此相較於只根
據單一方向氾流（Flooding）機制，儘管產生一些多餘的封包，但 PRGP確實能
達到較佳的封包到達率。

location of a sensor node, PGRP considers these two geo-
graphical information to determine the direction probability
(DirProb) and distance probability (DisProb), respectively. We
also defines the ultimate forwarding probability of a sensor
node as a weighted combination of DirProb and DisProb. In
addition, PGRP proposes a strategy whose main idea is that
sensor nodes have a higher ultimate forwarding probability
than the sender when they are closer to AOI than the sender.
Definitely, a node in the region of AOI must forward received
packets (i.e., DirProb = 1), while a node in other regions
depends on the level of vicinity to AOI to determine its
DirProb. On the other hand, a node considers the influence
of hop distance on forwarding probability. It uses the value
inverse to its hop count as its DisProb. Significantly, this
manner can avoid redundant packets flooded in the network.
This paper is the first one to explore the geocast routing issue
in VC-WSNs. The main contribution of this work is that a
rapid and cost-effective strategy based on DirProb and DisProb
to select proper forwarders is provided, and the proposed
geocast routing protocol based on this strategy can achieve
a satisfactory energy saving and preserve a significant packet
delivery ratio.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
describes the network model and assumptions. Section III
introduces a simple forwarding strategy as a baseline approach
for comparative evaluation. Section IV presents the proposed
probabilistic geocast routing protocol, namely PGRP, in detail.
Section V shows the simulation results. Section VI provides
concluding remarks of this paper.
II. NETWORK MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
The proposed PGRP performs on a square VC-WSN intro-
duced in [8], in which the sink is placed at the center. Given
the number of directions, say 2m, the network is partitioned
into 2m directional regions with the sink located at the center.
Each region is associated with a distinct directional code as
shown in Fig. 1. The directions are represented using the Gray
code and numbered counterclockwise.
Suppose that Ns stationary sensor nodes are randomly scat-
tered in the network. Sensor nodes, si, i = 1, 2, · · · , Ns, use
direction and distance as two virtual coordinates to represent
the location. The direction of a sensor node indicates the
directional code of the region where the node locates and the
distance of a sensor node indicates the number of hops from
the sink to that node. Let ci and hi denote the directional
code and distance of si, respectively. VC-WSN uses (ci,hi) to
represent the location of si. This paper identifies the AOI using
the direction and distance of TNs and denotes the directional
region of AOI as RAOI . Let cAOI and hAOI indicate the
direction and distance of TNs, respectively, and we denote the
AOI as (cAOI ,hAOI ). For example, if TNs locate in the region
with directional code 001 and at a distance of four-hop from
the sink, the AOI is identified as (001, 4). Let pdiri and pdisi
denote DirProb and DisProb of node si, respectively, and pi
denote the ultimate forwarding probability of sensor node si.
This work makes the following assumptions:
1) Each sensor node has a unique identifier.
2) Sensor nodes are aware of their virtual coordinates.
3) Sensor nodes have the same transmission range.
4) All TNs locate in the same directional code and at the
same distance from the sink.
5) The sink knows the location of AOI (i.e., (cAOI ,hAOI )).
III. SIMPLE DIRECTION-BASED FORWARDING (SDF)
STRATEGY
The main challenge of geocast routing is to determine the
proper forwarders. The basic concept of prior researches on
forwarder determination is that when a node receives packets,
it calculates a forwarding probability and then depends on
this probability to determine whether it has to forward the
received packets or not. Although these studies are not for VC-
WSNs, this paper intends to use this concept to introduce a
simple direction-based forwarding (SDF) strategy to determine
forwarders for geocast routing in VC-WSNs, and then extends
SDF strategy to propose the rules that PGRP considers.
Intuitively, if a node locates in RAOI , it must be given a
higher chance to become a forwarder than the nodes not in
RAOI . In addition, a node in RAOI must forward received
packets if it is closer to the sink than the nodes also in RAOI
because the packet has not reached TNs yet. Thus, this paper
proposes an SDF strategy which primarily considers Rule 1 to
determine the ultimate forwarding probability of sensor nodes
when they receive packets.
Rule 1: For a sensor node si, i = 1, 2, · · · , Ns, if ci =
cAOI and hi ≤ hAOI , then pi = 1. 2
Considering Rule 1 can achieve the outstanding packet
delivery ratio because packets are prone to be forwarded
towards TNs. However, this is likely to generate redundant
forwarding nodes to participate in forwarding packets, thereby
causing the so-called broadcast storm problem [10]. The SDF
strategy also consumes a considerable amount of energy, and
consequently shortens the network lifetime.

pdiri can be derived using this turning point. To quickly and
effortlessly determine cR
AOI
, we consider boolean operations
rather than arithmetical operations, and propose a Two Bit
Complement (TBC) approach as shown inLemma 1.
Lemma 1: Suppose the network is divided into 2m di-
rections. Let cAOI be represented by dmdm−1 . . . d1, where
di ∈ {0, 1} and 1 ≤ i ≤ m. If cR
AOI
is d′md′m−1 . . . d′1,
where d′i ∈ {0, 1} and 1 ≤ i ≤ m, then
d′i =
{
di if i > m− 2;
di Otherwise,
where di is the complement of di.
Proof: We first give the way to derive m-bit Gray code. When
m = 1, it is trivial and the resulting codes are simply 0 and
1. The 2-bit Gray code can be derived from the 1-bit Gray
code by first listing the 1-bit codes forward like 0, 1 and then
listing them backward as 1, 0. Then, we each append 0 to
the left for the first two 1-bit code and 1 for the last two. The
resulting 2-bit codes are 00, 01, 11, 10. By following the same
rule, we can derive m-bit Gray code from (m − 1)-bit Gray
code as follows. We first list the (m − 1)-bit codes forward
and then backward. Each of the first 2m−1 codes in the list
will be appended with 0 to the left and each of the rest 2m−1
codes (the ones in backward order) in the list will be appended
with 1 to the left. All the codes with a bit appended will be
the m-bit codes.
To show the lemma, we consider how the m-bit Gray code
is derived. Note that the difference on the order between codes
dmdm−1 . . . d1 and d′md′m−1 . . . d′1 is 2m−1 since they present
two totally opposite directions. This is the key for showing the
lemma. Recall that the way we construct the m-bit Gray code
and the difference on the order, d′m = dm. For the other bits,
we take a closer look at the construction of m-bit Gray code
as Fig. 4 shows. The (m−1)-th bits of the first 2m−2 and last
2m−2 codes are 0 and the (m− 1)-th bits of the 2m−1 codes
in between are 1. Since the difference on the order between
dmdm−1 . . . d1 and d′md′m−1 . . . d′1 is 2m−1, d′m−1 = dm−1.
Now, if we list all the m-bit codes as Fig. 4 and consider the
(m−2)-bit Gray code, the first 2m−1 (m−2)-bit codes are first
listed forward and then backward and the rest 2m−1 (m− 2)-
bit codes are then repeated. Again, because the difference on
the order between two given codes is 2m−1, d′m−2 . . . d′2d′1 =
dm−2 . . . d2d1. 2
B. Calculation of Ultimate Forwarding Probability
As mentioned above, the element corresponding to the
element identical to cR
AOI
in Qdir is a turning point to derive
pdiri . Given ci and Qdir, let Pos(ci) return the position of
element identical to ci in Qdir. Thus, given a VC-WSN with
2m directional regions, the DirProb of node si can be obtained
as

{
Pos(ci)− 1 if ci ∈ {q1, ..., cR
AOI
};
2m + 1−Pos(ci) if ci ∈ {cR
AOI
, ..., q2m}.
On the other hand, the DisProb of node si can be derived
from
pdisi =
1
hi
.
Recall that PGRP determines the forwarding probability
of nodes using a weighted function based on DirProb and
DisProb. Let α denote a predefined weighted value. The
forwarding probability of node si can be formulated as
pi = α× p
dir
i + (1− α)× p
dis
i . (1)
Algorithm 1 shows the algorithm of the proposed PGRP.
At any time, when a sink intends to send messages to TNs,
it broadcasts geocast packets to all of its neighboring nodes.
Once a node receives geocast packets, it uses Eq. (1) to deter-
mine its ultimate forwarding probability, and then depends on
this probability to determine whether it must forward received
packets or not. When receiving packets, TNs terminate the
forwarding of geocast packets.
C. Analysis
Compared with the SDF-based approach, PGRP is more
likely to achieve higher packet delivery ratio due to resistance
to physical obstacles or routing holes [11]. However, it may
render more packets during geocasting. This section gives an
analysis to show the numbers of generated packets of the SDF-
based approach and the proposed PGRP.
Given the network size A, the transmission range of sensor
nodes r, and the number of sensor nodes Ns, we can derive
the mean number of neighbors of sensor nodes (M) as
M =
pir2
A
Ns.
Let NSDFhi denote the number of packets that si transmits
in the SDF-based approach. Because the sink always transmits
geocast packets, it transmits geocast packet only once. In the
SDF-based approach, when node si where hi = 1 receives

VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a probabilistic geocast routing pro-
tocol, called PGRP, to improve the routing performance in
virtual coordinate-based wireless sensor networks. The key
concept of PGRP is to consider two probabilities, DirProb and
DisProb, for determining the ultimate forwarding probability
of sensor nodes. As a cost-effective solution, PGRP uses an

Simulation results confirm that PGRP considering DirProb and
DisProb achieves better packet delivery ratio than the SDF-
based approach although slightly generating more packets. Our

PGRP in the scenario in that AOI appears across numerous
directional regions.

Abstract—Data transmission in wireless networks is prone to be 
erroneous because of multipath fading, shadowing, interference, 
etc. Although the automatic repeat request (ARQ) and forward 
error correction (FEC) schemes provide reliable transmission, 
the ARQ scheme may suffer frequent retransmissions and the 
FEC scheme incurs bandwidth overhead due to additional 
information carried in transmitted packets. Previous studies 
introduce numerous efficient error recovery schemes, such as 
EARQ, SPaC, and CEC, to retrieve the original packet by 
combining erroneously received packets. To realize the 
performance of these schemes, this paper provides a discussion 
and an analysis of recovery speed and storage space cost, and 
then shows the simulation results. 
Keywords-packet combining, error recovery, automatic repeat 
request (ARQ), cyclic redundancy check (CRC)  
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Due to the influence of multipath fading, shadowing and 
interference, and the time-varying characteristic of channel 
condition, wireless links are much more likely to be error-
prone. This causes that receivers suffer a low packet reception 
ratio. To tackle this challenge, previous studies proposed a 
number of packet recovery schemes, primarily based on the 
concept of error control. Error detection and error correction 
are two underlying strategies to achieve error control. The 
automatic repeat request (ARQ) and the forward error 
correction (FEC) are typical mechanisms corresponding to 
theses two strategies. 
The ARQ mechanism, mainly operating at the media access 
control (MAC) layer, exploits requests for retransmission of 
erroneous received packets, and uses the standard cyclic 
redundancy check (CRC) approach to check the accuracy of 
received packets. The main concept of ARQ is that when 
receiving a data packet, receivers check this packet with CRC 
checksum and report an acknowledgement (ACK) or a negative 
acknowledgement (NACK) message to the transmitter 
according to the reception status. Whenever a transmitter 
receives the NACK message or fails to receive the ACK 
message before timeout, it retransmits a set of successive 
packets or a packet to accomplish reliable transmission 
depending on the ARQ type [1]. The FEC mechanism requires 
transmitters to append redundant coding information to the 
transmitted packet, and thus receivers have a chance to correct 
errors without requesting retransmission of the packet. 
Although the ARQ mechanism can efficiently achieve a 
reliable data transmission in different types of wireless systems, 
it is more likely to suffer frequent retransmissions when the 
quality of channels is extremely awful, thereby degrading the 
system throughput. On the other hand, the FEC mechanism is 
efficiently used for the applications where retransmissions are 
costly due to finite channel bandwidth, or impossible because 
of limited delay bound or no opportunity to retransmit packets. 
However, it is likely to result in additional recovery delay and 
potentially high bandwidth overhead.  
The literature argues that even if all the received copies of 
packets are erroneous, it may be possible to combine these 
copies to recover the correct packet [5]. Recent studies have 
proposed several error recovery schemes based on packet 
combining for a variety of wireless networks [2][3][4][5]. The 
main idea behind these schemes is to consider all the corrupt 
receptions of a given packet and then conduct an exhaustive 
search to generate the candidate packets which may contain the 
original packet. Once all the candidate packets are derived, the 
receiver checks the CRC residue of each candidate packet to 
determine the correct one. The EARQ scheme adopts this 
concept as an underlying strategy [2]. An improved solution, 
the simple packet combining (SPaC) error recovery scheme, is 
proposed for wireless sensor networks [3]. Unlike EARQ, 
SPaC introduces a merge procedure, hereafter termed SPaC-
Merge, which buffers the latest corrupted packet only, thereby 
saving a significant amount of storage space. A CRC based 
error corrector, called CEC, is proposed in [4]. In CEC, 
receivers buffer the first erroneously received packet only and 
maintain a bitmap vector to relax the buffer requirement. This 
scheme derives the positions of erroneous bits from erroneous 
copies using XOR and OR operations, and then depends on 
these positions to generate all candidate packets. To realize the 
performance of EARQ, SPaC-Merge, and CEC schemes, this 
study discusses the recovery speed, analyzes the storage space 
cost of these schemes, and provides comparative results via 
simulations using the bit error rate and frame length as major 
factors. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
presents the existing packet-combining-based error recovery 
2P , and regards this XORed result as an initial UIB. Whenever 
receiving 3P , it XORs 1P  and 3P , and ORs this XORed result 
and 1P  to generate a new UIB. Based on this UIB, the receiver 
derives all the candidates of the original packet, and uses the 
CRC test to check these candidates. Because the CEC scheme 
uses the OR operation to maintain the positions of all the 
possible error bits, it can definitely recover the original packet 
in case hidden error does not occur in all the corrupted packets. 
As shown in Figure 3, the receiver eventually retrieves the 
original packet successfully when receiving 3P .

IV. ANALYSIS OF STORAGE SPACE COST 
For ease of analysis, a series of packet receptions is divided 
into multiple rounds. That is, a receiver receives the i-th 
retransmitted copy of a specific packet in the i-th round. This 
paper compares the storage space cost of distinct packet 
combining based schemes in the i-th round, where 1i  . This 
storage space cost falls into four parts: (1) space for corrupted 
packets, (2) space for XORed results, (3) space for ORed result 
(i.e., UIB in CEC), and (4) space for candidate packets.

B. SPaC-Merge Scheme 
Recall that SPaC-Merge needs to store the current 
corrupted packet in each round if the original packet cannot be 
recovered. Whenever receiving a new incoming corrupted 
packet in the k-th round, receivers store this packet and 
combines this packet with the packet in the buffer (i.e., 1kP  ). 
Thus, we have

Due to considering only one XORed result, we obtain

Figure 6 shows the total amount of storage space of EARQ, 
SPaC-Merge, and CEC with different packet lengths and BERs. 
If the BER increases, the combinations of corrupted packets of 
three schemes are likely to possess information of more 
possible error bits. This causes that the number of candidate 
packets increases. As Figure 5 shows, the EARQ and CEC 
schemes outperform SPaC-Merge in recovery speed. However, 
the EARQ scheme combines any two corrupted packets to 
generate the candidates of the original packet. Like EARQ, the 
CEC scheme combines all the corrupted packets using XOR 
and OR operations, and consequently obtains a UIB. The 
combinations of these two schemes may possess more 
information of error bits than that of SPaC-Merge, thereby 
generating more candidate packets than SPaC-Merge does. In 
addition, the analysis shown in Section IV presents that the 
number of candidate packets dominates the storage space cost 
of three schemes, although there are additional space required 
for storing corrupted packets, XORed results, and UIB. This 
can be validated in Figure 6.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Error recovery is a crucial issue in wireless networks 
because data transmission in wireless networks is prone to be 
erroneous. This paper compares the performance of three error 
recovery schemes, EARQ, SPaC-Merge, and CEC, via 
discussion, analysis, and simulation. Performance evaluation 
results shows that the EARQ and CEC schemes have a better 
recovery speed than SPaC-Merge, as they have more 
information of error bits. On the other hand, the SPaC-Merge 
scheme outperforms both EARQ and CEC in storage space 
cost due to requiring less number of candidate packets.
