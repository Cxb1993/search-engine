In addition, their parasitic components are not well controlled. So their self-resonant 
frequencies will limit the bandwidth of not only phase shifter but also return loss.

High pass network including parasitic components.  
The parasitic component of a MIM capacitor is an inductor in series with the host 
capacitor. For spiral inductor, the parasitic component is a shunt capacitor. With good 
control of parasitic components, we can enhance the phase shift bandwidth as well as 
input matching bandwidth.  
In [7], the parasite of spiral inductor and MIM capacitor are controlled by layout 
for artificial transmission line by slot ground for inductor and aspect ratio of MIM 
capacitor. For microwave monolithic integrated circuit phase shifter, high pass and 
low pass network are often implemented also by spiral inductors and MIM capacitors 
[8].  
In this paper, the high pass network is designed and its the parasitic effect is 
considered to extend the bandwidth not only phase but also return loss after resonant 
frequency. In Section II, the design procedure is given. In Section III, the quadrature 
power splitter is implemented on LTCC process. In Section IV, measured result for a 
fabricated quadrature power splitter is provided and conclusions are presented in 
Section V. 
II. DESIGN APPROACH 
The topology of quadrature power splitter is shown in Fig.1 (a). The phase 
adjusting circuits are based on high pass network and microstrip line. The microstrip 
line is chosen for phase lag network due to its wide bandwidth and easy to design the 
phase delay by tuning length. The phase lead network is a high pass type circuit 
shown in Fig.1 (b). Since T-type high pass network only needs one inductor instead of 
two inductors in -type high pass network, we use it to realize phase lead network in 
LTCC. However the parasitic effects of components in high pass network as shown in 
Fig.1(c) should be considered. This can allow high pass network to operate to 
frequency higher than self resonant frequency of each L or C to increase operating 
bandwidth in magnitude as well as in phase shift. Also the equation for phase shift can 
be modified to increase phase shift bandwidth. The S21 of the high pass network in 
Fig.1(c) can be derived from ABCD matrix as :

L CL C L C L C                              (7) 
(7) shows that with smaller parasitic components Lp and Cp, the bandwidth of -10dB 
can be enhanced. The values of Lp and Cp can be controlled from layout in LTCC. 
They should be as small as possible, as smaller values can reduce the length of 
microstrip line and extend the bandwidth of high pass network.  
The design procedures of the broadband quadrature power splitter are summarized 
in following. 
1) Design the Wilkinson power divider at center frequency 
2) Design ideal component values for high pass network which provides 42.5° phase 
lead and microstrip line provides 42.5° phase lag at center frequency with 85° 
phase shift.  
3) Synthesis the layout for high pass network. 
4) Extract the parasitic component value of high pass network from EM simulation. 
Adjust layout to have minimum parasitic components while maintaining

5)  Compensate the phase lag of high pass network by tuning the length of 
microstrip line. 
III. LAYOUT SYNTHESIS AND SIMULATION 
The quadrature power splitter was designed at center frequency 4.5GHz. We 
implemented the QPS on multilayer LTCC with dielectric constant of 7.5 and 
thickness of 40 m for each layer. For design flow step one, the 70.7Ω transmission 
line for Wilkinson power divider is designed at center frequency at 4.5GHz. The 
serpentine microstrip line is used for compact size. Due to the need of 100Ω SMD 
resister for good isolation, the pad for 0402 or 0603 SMD resistors at two output ports 
are also added as shown in Fig.2. Simulated by Agilent ADS Momentum, the return 
loss of all ports and isolation are better than 10dB as shown in Fig.2(b) and insertion 
loss is less than 0.5dB from 2GHz to 7.1GHz.

for 90°+/- 5° phase difference between two outputs port is 85% from 2.9GHz to 7.2 
GHz and agreed well with EM and lump circuit model simulation. The input port and 
output port return losses are better than 10dB from 2 to 8GHz. The amplitude 
imbalance is better than 0.6dB and isolation is better than 12dB. The size of QPS 
excluding pads is 7.1mm×6.2mm. Table II shows the performance comparison with 
other published QPSs. The size in terms of wavelength at center frequency is only 9% 
of [6], and upper limit of operating frequency is two times of [6]. Relative bandwidth 
is better than QPS realized in MMIC.
