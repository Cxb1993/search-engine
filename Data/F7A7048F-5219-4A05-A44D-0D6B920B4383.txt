Abstract .  As a powerful machine-learning approach to pattern recognition problems, the support vector machine (SVM) is known to 
easily allow generalization. More importantly, it works very well in a high-dimensional feature space. This paper presents a nonlinear 
active suspension controller which achieves a high level performance by compensating for actuator dynamics. We use a linear quadratic 
regulator (LQR) to ensure optimal control of nonlinear systems. An LQR is used to solve the problem of state feedback and an SVM is 
used to address the question of the estimation and examination of the state. These two are then combined and designed in a way that 
outputs feedback control. The real -time simulation demonstrates that an active suspension using the combined SVM-LQR controller 
provides passengers with a much more comfortable ride and better road handling. 
1.  Introduction 
Support vector machines (SVMs) have been very successful in pattern recognition and function estimation 
problems. In terms of standard SVM approaches, the dual form of a quadratic programming problem plays an 
important role in the generation of nonlinear discriminate functions. In order to obtain a nonlinear discriminate 
function, we assume a nonlinear projection f   which maps the data point x  onto a higher, often infinitely, 
dimensional feature space F  where linear discriminate functions are developed. It is crucial that, in the feature 
space F  we can formulate the problem without involving the calculations of the vectors Fx Î)(f . The Wolfe 
dual formulation enables us to express the quadratic programming problem only in terms of the value of the 
inner product ( ))(),( ji xx ff  which can be computed directly from the original data points, ix  and jx , by means 
of the kernel functions. Indeed, kernel-based nonlinear discriminate functions have been successfully applied to 
a number of real world problems [1]. [2] introduced the use of a least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) 
to ensure optimal control of nonlinear systems. A team led by Wang et al. (2007) [3] proposes the elaboration of 
an adaptive inverse control algorithm by combining a fast online support vector machine regression (SVR) 
algorithm with a straight inverse control algorithm. The resulting adaptive algorithm is easy to employ; on the 
basis of a kernel cache-based method, it functions well in real time; and it performs well in the control of 
time-varying systems. Friedrichs and Igel [4] proposed an evolutionary approach to the determination of 
multiple SVM hyperparameters: The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is used to 
determine the kernel from a parameterized kernel space and to control regularization. Such a procedure is 
applicable to the optimization of non-differentiable kernel functions and arbitrary model selection criteria. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the basic concept of support vector machines. 
Section 3 briefly reviews the optimal control problem. In section 4, a controlled simulation of an active 
suspension system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a combined SVM-LQR system. 
The last section concludes this paper.

Constructin g the optimal hyperplane is therefore a convex quadratic problem. This is the crucial property that 
allows generalization to the non-linear case. Differentiation on the basis of the Lagrange function is achieved by 
substituting bw,  and 0³ia  for each of the constraints in (1) to get the following Lagrangian function:

Thus, it is possible to equivalently solve the dual optimization problem of maximization (3), such that the 
gradient of L with respect to wand b vanishes, which requires that 0³ia . This can be expressed as follows [5,

To complete the process described above, we apply the concept of an SVM to a crisp nonlinear regression. 
The basic idea is that a nonlinear regression is achieved by simply pre-processing input patterns ix  by means of 
a map FRn ®:f into some feature space F , and then applying the standard ridge regression learning 
algorithm. It is necessary only to directly apply  ( ) )(),(, jiji xxxxK ff= rather than define )(×f  explicitly. 
Thus, we obtain the following dual optimization problem:

Here 0³= TQQ  and 0>= TRR  are weighting matrices. It is well known that if an optimal control )(tu  
exists, k  is a constant gain matrix. Moreover, the closed loop system is stable: 
 
)()()()()( tXBkAtBkXtAXtX -=-=&                                                                                          (11) 
 
where [ ]Turusus zzzzzzX && ,,, --= . 
The 0>R  assumption ensures the energy of the control to be finite. Next, we perform an LQR synthesis via 
the Riccati equation to determine the feedback gain matrix k . If 
01 =-++ - PBPBRQPAPA TT  and if PBRk T1-= then the closed loop system in (11) is asymptotically 
stable. 
Our online SVM control system can be described as Fig. 3. Given the following training sample sets, 
( ){ }njizRuxszsX ijnijijijijij L,1,4~1],1,1[,),(, ==-ÎÎ== , we can construct a linear regression function (as in 7),

of a reference LQR. ( ) 1)(, ±==<+= jjjjj EsignzdeeE e  where e  is the error value.

The active suspension control system of an automobile is currently of great interest [7, 8], both academically and 
in the automobile industry worldwide. In 1999, Kuo and Li [9] use a GA-based fuzzy PI/PD controller in an 
automotive active suspension system (AASS). For the quarter-car suspension system discussed in this section,
