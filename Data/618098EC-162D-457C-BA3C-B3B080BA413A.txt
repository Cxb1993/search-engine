Abstract—A new quadrature oscillator circuit using 
three multiple outputs second-generation current 
conveyors (CCIIs), two grounded capacitors and three 
resistors is presented. Two high output impedance current-
mode signals and two voltage-mode signals each pair with 
90o phase difference are available in the proposed circuit. 
The oscillation condition and oscillation frequency are 
independently controllable through grounded resistors. 
The use of only grounded capacitors makes the proposed 
circuit ideal for integrated circuit implementation. 
Experimental results are also included. 
I. INTRODUCTION  
A quadrature oscillator is used because the circuit 
provides two sinusoids with 90o phase difference, as for 
example in telecommunications for quadrature mixers and 
single-sideband generators or for measurement purposes 
in vector generators or selective voltmeters. Therefore, 
quadrature oscillators constitute an important unit in many 
communication and instrumentation systems [1]-[7]. Note 
that, these earlier quadrature oscillators [1]-[7] generated 
voltage-mode signals. Several current-mode sinusoidal 
oscillators were proposed in [8]-[12]. However, the 
current-mode high output impedance sinusoidal 
oscillators presented in [8]-[10] do not provide another 
high output impedance quadrature current output. 
Moreover, the current-mode quadrature oscillators 
presented in [11]-[12] require additional current followers 
for sensing and taking out the quadrature outputs therein 
and the use of these additional current followers with the 
virtual grounded input may result in floating capacitors 
realization for what is originally described as grounded 
capacitors realization. In 2005, Maheshwari and Khan 
proposed a third order current-mode quadrature oscillator 
using four multiple outputs current controlled current 
conveyors with high output  
 
 
impedance [13]. 
In this paper, a new quadrature oscillator circuit using 
three multiple outputs second-generation current 
conveyors (CCIIs), two grounded capacitors and three 
resistors is presented. Two high output impedance 
sinusoid current-mode signals and two voltage-mode 
signals each pair with 90o phase difference are available in 
the proposed circuit. The oscillation condition and 
oscillation frequency are independently controllable 
through grounded resistors. The use of only grounded 
capacitors makes the proposed circuit ideal for integrated 
circuit implementation [14]. 
II. CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION  
The circuit symbol of the multiple outputs CCII is 
shown in figure 1, which shows the two types of output 
terminals, the positive outputs represented by terminal z+ 
and the negative by terminal z-. The terminal 
characteristic of the multiple outputs CCII can be 
described by the following matrix equation:

Equations (12) and (13) are coupled due to the parasitic 
impedances, especially because R5 is finite. This fact 
implies that the adjustment of the oscillation condition 
affects the oscillation frequency [R1’ appears in both (12) 
and (13)]. Nevertheless, the oscillation frequency can be 
independently tuned by varying R3 after adjusting the 
oscillation condition by means of R1. By assuming that α  
and β  are near to unity, R4 and R5 are very much greater 
than R1, R2 and R3. The active sensitivities of this 
sinusoidal oscillator are all low and obtained as

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
To verify the theoretical prediction of the proposed 
circuit, figure 2 has been realized with discrete 
components. The current-mode output signals Io1 and Io2 
were connected to Ro1 and Ro2, respectively. The AD844 
IC was used to implement a CCII+. The implementation of 
multiple outputs CCII employing discrete AD844s is 
shown in figure 4. Figure 5 and figure 6 show the 
experimental output waveforms of the voltage-mode and 
current-mode quadrature output signals in figure 2 with 
external capacitors C1 = C2 = 55 pF, R1= 9.9 kΩ , R2 = R3 
= 10 k Ω  and the power supply ± 5 V, respectively. The 
current-mode signals of Io1 and Io2 were obtained by 
measuring the voltages Vo3 and Vo4 on Ro1 and Ro2, 
respectively, with Ro1 = Ro2 =10 k Ω . Figure 7 shows the 
experimental results of the oscillation frequency of figure 2 
by varying the value of the resistor R3 with external 
capacitors C1 = C2 = 55 pF, R1= 9.9 k Ω , R2 = 10 k Ω  and 
the power supply ± 5V. Because the parasitic capacitances 
of the CCIIs are not small compared with the external 
capacitances C1 and C2 in the experiments. The theoretical 
values in figure 7 were obtained by equation (14) with C1’ 
= 85 pF, C2’ = 77 pF and R2’ = 10 k Ω . The non-idealities 
in figure 7 may be due to the ignored stray capacitances 
resulting from the bread board implementation.
