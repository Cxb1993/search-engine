Fig. 3. Illustrative V-shaped curve for the estimation of ACF failure
probability.
V-shaped curve method for predicting the failure probability of
ACF-packaged IC/substrate assemblies [5]–[8].
As shown in Fig. 3, the V-shaped curve plots the failure
probability against the volume fraction of conductive particles
in the ACF for a given set of geometry parameters. To establish
the V-shaped curve, the probability of opening failures is calcu-
lated using a Poisson function [9], [10], while that of bridging
failures is calculated using a box model [11]. The overall failure
probability of the package is then estimated by combining the
opening and bridging probabilities using a probability theory. In
the resulting V-shaped curve, the portion to the left of the min-
imum point corresponds to the opening probability, while that
to the right of the minimum point corresponds to the bridging

lower pads in ACF assembly.
probability. Furthermore, the volume fraction corresponding to
the minimum point of the V-shaped curve is the optimal volume
fraction for the package.
The current group proposed four different failure prediction
models for fine-pitch connections using ACF [10]. Comparing
the four methods, it was found that the model utilizing a Poisson
function to evaluate the probability of fewer than six particles
existing per pad yielded the most accurate predictions of the
opening failure probability [12], [13]. In a recent study, the
current group proposed an enhanced box model for predicting
the bridging failure probability in ACF packages based upon
a consideration of all the possible conductive and linear paths
between adjacent pad pairs [11]. The results showed that the
enhanced bridging model yielded more accurate estimates of
the minimum failure probability and optimal volume fraction
than existing bridging models. In another recent study, the
current group examined the effect of the upper-to-lower pad-
height ratio on the failure probability of ACF packages and
showed that the failure probability can be reduced by reducing
the total height of the two pad arrays or by utilizing pad arrays
with an equal height [14]. It should be mentioned that the whole
failure models in this paper are based on the geometry effects,
and the resistivity of the particles is not considered.
For analytical convenience, the pads on the IC and substrate
of an ACF package are generally assumed to be of the same size
[see Fig. 4(a)]. However, in practice, the two sets of pads often
have different dimensions [see Fig. 4(b)]. Thus, in analyzing
the true failure probability of ACF assemblies, it is necessary
to consider an asymmetric IC/substrate pad size. In [15], the
current group examined the effects of alignment errors on the
reliability of ACF packages with a symmetric pad size. The
results showed that a misalignment of the upper and lower
pads affects both the overall failure probability of the package
and the optimal volume fraction of conductive particles. In
this paper, the V-shaped curve method is used to analyze the
failure probability of ACF packages with both an asymmetric
IC/substrate pad size and misalignment offsets.

WITH MISALIGNMENT OFFSETS
A. Opening Failure Analysis Using Poisson Function
As described in the previous section, ACF assemblies are
liable to two different types of failure, namely, opening failures

F. Analysis of Global Failure Probability
Considering all the pads in the IC/substrate assembly, the
global probabilities of opening and bridging failures are given,
respectively, by
PGopening [O(1, 1) ∪O(1, 2) ∪ · · ·
∪O(s1, t1 − 1) ∪O(s1, t1)]

(10)
where O(s1, t1) is the unitary opening event index and
B(s2, t2) is the unitary bridging event index. The overall global
failure probability can be computed using a numerical scheme
based on the inclusion–exclusion principle [16]. The right hand
side of (9) contains as many terms as there are pads within the
assembly. Consequently, an efficient numerical scheme is re-
quired to calculate (9) since IC/substrate assemblies especially
contain as many as 100 pads within each array in the proposed
cases. In practice, the probability of an opening failure at any
given pad is independent of that at any other pad in the array. As
a result, the global opening failure probability given in (9) can
be expressed in the form shown in (11). Similarly, the global
bridging failure probability given in (10) can be rewritten in the
form shown in (12)

III. FAILURE PROBABILITY ESTIMATION PROCEDURE
A. Misalignment Offset Parameters (Ex, Ey) and
Asymmetric Pad-Width Parameter Dp
This paper considers the failure probability of ACF packages
with both an asymmetric upper/lower pad width and misalign-
ment offsets. To facilitate the analysis, two parameters are de-
fined, namely, the pad-width difference parameter (Dp) and the
misalignment offset parameter (Ex or Ey). Note that, in order
to investigate the interactive effect between these parameters,
Dp, Ex, and Ey are all defined relative to the center line of
the ACF assembly in a perfectly aligned condition. As shown
in Fig. 5, the pad-width difference parameter is defined as
Dp = ((l′ − l)/2l)× 100%, where l′ is the side length of the
upper pad and l is the side length of the lower pad. Fig. 6
presents a schematic illustration showing the effect of align-
ment errors on the opening failure probability in the asymmetric
ACF package. The present analyses consider three alignment
conditions, namely: 1) (Ex = Ey = 0), i.e., the upper and
lower pads are centrally aligned; 2) (0 < (Ex,Ey) ≤Dp),
i.e., the lower pad is offset from the centrally aligned position
but still falls within the boundaries of the upper pad (denoted
as Misalignment I); and 3) (0 <Dp < (Ex,Ey)), i.e., the
lower pad is offset from the centrally aligned position and
extends beyond the boundaries of the upper pad (denoted as
Misalignment II).
LIN et al.: FAILURE PROBABILITY ESTIMATION OF ACF PACKAGES 373
h = 8 μm and l = 60 μm, respectively, and the pad separation
distance is specified as d = 80 μm. Moreover, the particle size
is assumed to be r = 2 μm, and the pad array is assumed to
have dimensions of n× n = 10× 10. In addition, in investi-
gating the respective effects of an asymmetric pad size and
misalignment offsets, Dp is assigned values in the range of
0 ≤ Dp ≤ 10%, while Ex and Ey are specified in the range of
0 ≤ Ex = Ey ≤ 20%. It should be noted that the misalignment
offsets are deliberately assigned a far higher value than that
observed in real-world ACF packages in order to more easily
identify their effects on the failure probability.
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
A. Effects of Misalignment Offsets on Opening Failure
Probability in Symmetric and Asymmetric ACF Packages
For an ACF package with a symmetric pad size [see
Fig. 4(a)], the opening failure probability increases monoto-
nously with an increasing misalignment offset since the ef-
fective conductive area is immediately reduced as soon as
any misalignment occurs. In other words, the opening failure
probability is highly sensitive to the alignment of the upper and
lower pads. By contrast, in an ACF package with an asymmetric
pad size [see Fig. 4(b)], the lower pad is smaller than the upper
pad and remains within the shadow of the upper pad for small
misalignment offsets. Thus, for small values of Ex = Ey , the
opening failure probability remains constant. However, when
the misalignment offset is sufficient to cause the lower pad
to extend beyond the border of the upper pad (see Fig. 6), a
reduction in the effective conductive area occurs, and thus, the
opening failure probability increases.
B. Effects of Misalignment Offsets on Bridging Failure
Probability in Symmetric and Asymmetric ACF Packages
For both symmetric and asymmetric ACF packages, a mis-
alignment of the upper and lower pad arrays results in a change
in the lengths of the bridging paths between the neighboring
pad pairs. As shown in Fig. 7 for an asymmetric package, four
possible bridging paths exist between neighboring pad pairs,
namely, Path II (the shortest path), Path III (the longest path),
and Paths I and IV (fixed distance paths). Intuitively, the bridg-
ing probability is highest along the shortest path and lowest
along the longest path. In addition, the bridging probability in
the x-direction is equal to that in the y-direction provided that
Ex = Ey due to the symmetric arrangement of the pads in the
pad array. In the asymmetric ACF package, the larger width
of the upper pads shortens the lengths of Paths I, II, and III
relative to the lengths of the equivalent paths in a symmetric
ACF package. As a result, the bridging failure probability is
higher in the asymmetric ACF package than in the symmetric
ACF package.
C. Effect of Pad-Width Difference on Failure Probability for
Different Misalignment Offsets
Figs. 9–12 present the V-shaped curves obtained when the
pad-width difference is specified as Dp = 0%, 2%, 4%, and
Fig. 9. V-shaped curves for various x- and y-direction misalignment offsets
(Ex, Ey) and Dp = 0%.

8%, respectively, and the misalignment offset conditions are
specified as (Ex, Ey) = (0%, 0%), (4%, 4%), (8%, 8%), (12%,
12%), (16%, 16%), and (20%, 20%). Fig. 9 shows that, for a
symmetric ACF package, the failure probability increases as
soon as any misalignment between the upper and lower pads
occurs due to the reduction in the effective conductive area
and the shortening of the bridging paths between neighboring
pad pairs. In addition, it is observed that the V-shaped curves
not only move in the upward direction with an increasing
misalignment (indicating a greater failure probability) but also
move to the right. This suggests that a misalignment of the
upper and lower pads has a greater effect on the opening failure

probability increases monotonously with increasing Dp. From
inspection, the minimum failure probability is equal to 1.6×
10−9 and is obtained when the pad-width difference is specified
as Dp = 4%. The corresponding volume fraction (i.e., the
optimal volume fraction for the ACF package) is found to be
0.09 (i.e., 9%). Fig. 15, corresponding to a misalignment offset
condition of Ex = Ey = 8%, shows that the tip value trend of
the family curves (see the dashed arrow) like a parabola, and
the user can find the optimal designed point as well. The value
of the tip of the V-shaped curve presents the lowest failure
probability under specified geometry parameters, difference

parameter, and misalignment offset. Hence, the user can choose
the lowest tip of the dashed arrow with related packaging
conditions to obtain the optimal yield. Overall, the results
presented in Figs. 14 and 15 show that the optimal design
point is located at the minimum position of the dashed arrow
(connecting the tip points of the individual curves) given the
condition Dp(minimum) < Ex = Ey < Dp(maximum). Fig. 16
considers the case where the misalignment offset is greater
than the pad-width difference. In general, the results show that,
for the condition Ex = Ey > Dp, both the failure probability
and the optimal volume fraction can be reduced by increasing
the size of the upper pad. From inspection, the optimal design
point is found to be a volume fraction of 0.09 and a pad-width
difference of Dp = 10%. Under these conditions, the failure
probability is about equal to 8× 10−8.
E. Effects of Misalignment and Pad-Width Difference on
Minimum Failure Probability
The tip failure probabilities (difference percentage Dp ver-
sus the lowest failure probability) of the V-shaped curves are
shown in Fig. 17. This diagram can be divided into two regions
(Ex = Ey >Dp, with the upper region representing that the
lowest failure probability is decreasing with the Dp increas-
ing, and Ex = Ey <Dp, with the lower region representing
that the lowest failure probability is increasing with the Dp
increasing) by the dashed line (Ex = Ey =Dp). Generally
speaking, the failure probability of the optimal designed point
should increase with misalignment increasing under a specified
difference percentageDp. However, the tip failure probabilities
of V-shaped curves are decreasing with the Dp increasing
in the upper region, and the major factor is the effective
conductive area increasing as the Dp is increasing under the
condition Ex = Ey >Dp even though the bridging paths are
shortened (see Paths I–III in Fig. 7). In the lower region, the

Failure Theory considering Multilayered ACF 
Poisson function with average concept is applied in the opening analysis. For a given 
assembly geometry with s layers, the probability of maintaining an effective contact between the 
upper and low pad arrays in the IC / substrate assembly can be ensured by designing the volume 
fraction of the ACF compound such that the following condition is satisfied [3] and the opening 
analysis in the multilayered ACF packaging can be expressed as:

the pads in the vertical direction; f is the volume fraction of particles within the ACF resin; l is the

Bridging model is applied in the bridging analysis. A 
bridging failure occurs when a continuous chain of conductive 
particles is formed between neighboring pads. Lin et al. [2]

bridging in multiple directions. The bridging model was 
further enhanced by Lin et al. [4]. According to this enhanced 
model, the bridging failure probability is given by

Eq. (1).  In the bridging analysis, the various layers ACFs (from 1 layer to 6 layers) shown in Fig. 
2 are arranged and graphed by considering to space-in between ACF and NCA.  Every layered 
ACF contains the conductive particles with the volume fraction f, and the total thickness of the 
multilayer ACF is fixed in 120 microns. Hence, the thickness of the sub-layered ACF can be listed 
as (1-layer, 120 microns; 2-layers, 60 microns; 3-layers, 40 microns; 4-layers, 30 microns; 5-layers, 
24 microns; 6-layers, 20 microns). 
Results and Discussions 
Multilayered ACF patterns are designed and tested by numerical method developed in this 
study.  The volume fraction f is the major parameter in material characteristic, and the analyzed 
IC/Substrate assembly includes the parameters (l, d, h, r) which are used to define the geometry 
conditions.  In fact, the multilayered ACF can present many patterns by their different combination, 
and even the complex composition including the different conductive particle radius, the variation 
thickness, the composite material, and the heterogeneous compound matrix, etc.  To reduce the 
bridging effects, the ACF and NCA are stacked layers by layers and spaced with each other.  The 
major function of the added NCA is to block the particles chain of the bridging path and to reduce 
the number of the bridging chain.  However, the NCA layers increasing will lead to decrease the 
particles between the pads of the IC/ Substrate and increase the opening failure probability.  In the 
Figs. 3-5, the V-shaped curves in the 1-6 layers present the effects which is the volume fraction can 
be designed in the curves’ tips, and these tips are the optimal designed points for obtaining the 
lowest failure probability in some specified geometry parameters.  In this case, the V-shaped 
curves of the 1, 3, and 5 layers are shifted to the right (higher volume fraction), and the results are 1, 
5, and 3 layers in sequences.  The above description is the 5 layered ACF presents smaller average 
volume fraction than the 3 layered ACF in the opening analysis, and conversely the 5 layered ACF 
presents larger total volume fraction than the 3 layered ACF in the bridging analysis.  In addition, 
the V-shaped curves of the 2, 4, and 6 layers present the original tendency in the opening analysis, 
and the failure probability decreases with the layers increasing.  Refer to the geometry parameters 
(l, d, h, and r) in the Figs. 3-5, the pad length and the pads distance (l, d) are assigned as (125, 125), 
(250, 250), and (500, 500) microns.  Hence, the optimal designed point show the magnitudes of 
order in the Figs.3-5 are about -4, -20, and -40 in sequences.  The results show the failure 
probability decreasing with the dimensional parameters l or d increasing.  An important result is 
the tips’ values of the V-shaped curves will present a significant difference under the smaller 
geometry parameters (l, d)=(125, 125) microns, and the larger geometry parameters (l, d)=(125, 125) 
microns will present as the smaller differences.  Because the dimensional limitation of the 
multilayered ACF is constrained in a film grade (about 100 microns or above), so the layer’s 
number will be limited in a range of reasonable value.  In general, the layer’s number is decided by 
designer for the purpose to consider the lower failure probability and better mechanical 
performance, even so the user is still necessary to balance the benefits between the electrics and 
mechanics properties.  For the commercial potential, the users must consider the prime cost for 
seeking the lowest failure probability.  Significantly, the results presented in this study have shown 
that the effects on the failure probability are reduced as the value of the volume fraction approaches 
the value corresponding to the tip of the V-shaped curve. Hence, when specifying the composition 
of the multilayered ACF, the volume fraction f should be assigned the tip value in order to minimize 
the failure probability estimates obtained using the V-shaped curve method. 
Conclusion 
In this paper, the authors masterly develop a computational method to analyze the failure 
probability of the multilayered ACF in the IC/Substrate of the upper/lower pads.  The overall 
failure probability of the IC/substrate assembly can be obtained by using the probability theory to 
analyze the local and global failure probabilities considering the combining effects of the 
multilayered ACF & NCA. The major findings and contributions of this paper can be summarized

Failure Theory considering Multilayered ACF 
Poisson function with average concept is applied in the opening analysis. For a given 
assembly geometry with s layers, the probability of maintaining an effective contact between the 
upper and low pad arrays in the IC / substrate assembly can be ensured by designing the volume 
fraction of the ACF compound such that the following condition is satisfied [3] and the opening 
analysis in the multilayered ACF packaging can be expressed as:

where Po is the failure probability of the single pads; µo is the average number of particles between 
the pads in the vertical direction; f is the volume fraction of particles within the ACF resin; l is the 
side length of the square pads; r is the radius of the conductive particles; and l* is a dimensionless 
integer defined as l*=[l/2r] (where [ ] is a Gaussian operator). 
Bridging model is applied in the bridging analysis. A 
bridging failure occurs when a continuous chain of conductive 
particles is formed between neighboring pads. Lin et al. [2] 
modified this box model to take account of the possibility of 
bridging in multiple directions. The bridging model was 
further enhanced by Lin et al. [4]. According to this enhanced 
model, the bridging failure probability is given by

where O( 1s , 1t ) is the unitary opening event index and B( 2s , 2t ) is the unitary bridging event 
index. The overall global failure probability can be computed using a numerical scheme based on 
the Inclusion-Exclusion Principal [5]. The right hand side of Eq. (4) contains as many terms as there 
are pads within the assembly. The probability of an opening failure at any pad is independent of that 
at any other pad in the array, and hence the global opening failure probability given in Eq. (4) can 
be expressed in the form shown in Eq. (6). Similarly, the global bridging failure probability given in 
Eq. (5) can be rewritten in the form shown in Eq. (7).

Eq. (1).  In the bridging analysis, the various layers ACFs (from 1 layer to 6 layers) shown in Fig. 
2 are arranged and graphed by considering to space-in between ACF and NCA.  Every layered 
ACF contains the conductive particles with the volume fraction f, and the total thickness of the 
multilayer ACF is fixed in 120 microns. Hence, the thickness of the sub-layered ACF can be listed 
as (1-layer, 120 microns; 2-layers, 60 microns; 3-layers, 40 microns; 4-layers, 30 microns; 5-layers, 
24 microns; 6-layers, 20 microns). 
Results and Discussions 
Multilayered ACF patterns are designed and tested by numerical method developed in this 
study.  The volume fraction f is the major parameter in material characteristic, and the analyzed 
IC/Substrate assembly includes the parameters (l, d, h, r) which are used to define the geometry 
conditions.  In fact, the multilayered ACF can present many patterns by their different combination, 
and even the complex composition including the different conductive particle radius, the variation 
thickness, the composite material, and the heterogeneous compound matrix, etc.  To reduce the 
bridging effects, the ACF and NCA are stacked layers by layers and spaced with each other.  The 
major function of the added NCA is to block the particles chain of the bridging path and to reduce 
the number of the bridging chain.  However, the NCA layers increasing will lead to decrease the 
particles between the pads of the IC/ Substrate and increase the opening failure probability.  In the 
Figs. 3-5, the V-shaped curves in the 1-6 layers present the effects which is the volume fraction can 
be designed in the curves’ tips, and these tips are the optimal designed points for obtaining the 
lowest failure probability in some specified geometry parameters.  In this case, the V-shaped 
curves of the 1, 3, and 5 layers are shifted to the right (higher volume fraction), and the results are 1, 
5, and 3 layers in sequences.  The above description is the 5 layered ACF presents smaller average 
volume fraction than the 3 layered ACF in the opening analysis, and conversely the 5 layered ACF 
presents larger total volume fraction than the 3 layered ACF in the bridging analysis.  In addition, 
the V-shaped curves of the 2, 4, and 6 layers present the original tendency in the opening analysis, 
and the failure probability decreases with the layers increasing.  Refer to the geometry parameters 
(l, d, h, and r) in the Figs. 3-5, the pad length and the pads distance (l, d) are assigned as (125, 125), 
(250, 250), and (500, 500) microns.  Hence, the optimal designed point show the magnitudes of 
order in the Figs.3-5 are about -4, -20, and -40 in sequences.  The results show the failure 
probability decreasing with the dimensional parameters l or d increasing.  An important result is 
the tips’ values of the V-shaped curves will present a significant difference under the smaller 
geometry parameters (l, d)=(125, 125) microns, and the larger geometry parameters (l, d)=(125, 125) 
microns will present as the smaller differences.  Because the dimensional limitation of the 
multilayered ACF is constrained in a film grade (about 100 microns or above), so the layer’s 
number will be limited in a range of reasonable value.  In general, the layer’s number is decided by 
designer for the purpose to consider the lower failure probability and better mechanical 
performance, even so the user is still necessary to balance the benefits between the electrics and 
mechanics properties.  For the commercial potential, the users must consider the prime cost for 
seeking the lowest failure probability.  Significantly, the results presented in this study have shown 
that the effects on the failure probability are reduced as the value of the volume fraction approaches 
the value corresponding to the tip of the V-shaped curve. Hence, when specifying the composition 
of the multilayered ACF, the volume fraction f should be assigned the tip value in order to minimize 
the failure probability estimates obtained using the V-shaped curve method. 
Conclusion 
In this paper, the authors masterly develop a computational method to analyze the failure 
probability of the multilayered ACF in the IC/Substrate of the upper/lower pads.  The overall 
failure probability of the IC/substrate assembly can be obtained by using the probability theory to 
analyze the local and global failure probabilities considering the combining effects of the 
multilayered ACF & NCA. The major findings and contributions of this paper can be summarized
