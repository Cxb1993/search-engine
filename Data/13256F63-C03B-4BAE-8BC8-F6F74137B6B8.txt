Abstract   
 
The strengthening mechanisms and bending toughness of the AZ61 Mg based composites reinforced by nano SiO2 
particles are examined. The composites were prepared either by spray forming, ingot metallurgy, or powder metallurgy, 
followed by severe hot extrusion. The spray formed composites exhibit the best nano particle distribution and toughness, 
but the volume fraction of the nano particles that can be inserted is limited. The nano composites fabricated through the 
powder metallurgy method possess the highest strength due to the extra strengthening effect from the MgO phase. 
Strengthening analysis based on the Orowan strengthening mechanism can predict well the composite strength provided 
that the nano particles are in reasonably uniform dispersion. For composites containing higher nano particle volume 
fractions greater than 3%, the experimental strength data fall well below the theoretical predictions, suggesting poor 
dispersion of the reinforcement. 
 
Keywords: Mg alloy, nano particles, composites, strengthening, toughness  
  
1.  Introduction 
 
The success in fabricating various nano-sized 
powders, wires or tubes has provided the new possibility 
in modifying the existing commercial materials in terms 
of their functional or structural characteristics. Inorganic 
nano oxide, nitride, refractory or highly electrically 
conductive metallic powders may be inserted in 
polymers, ceramics, metals, or semiconductors by 
various means. Except for few reports, the major 
achievements were focused on the polymer matrix 
modified by ceramic nano particles so as to significantly 
improve its mechanical or physical properties. The 
addition of nano powders in metallic alloys has been 
relatively much less addressed.1) 
The uniform dispersion of the nano reinforcements 
has always been a critical and difficult task. Due to the 
high surface area ratio, nano powders tend to cluster 
together, sometimes forming micro-sized aggregates. 
The performance of the modified alloys would 
sensitively depend on the filler dispersion. Based on 
previous experience,1) secondary severe deformation 
processing such as rolling or extrusion might be 
promising routes to disperse the reinforcements. In this 
study, the AZ61 Mg alloys with nano-sized SiO2 
particles are prepared by spray forming (SF), ingot 
metallurgy (IM), and powder metallurgy (PM), followed 
by severe hot extrusion.  
Spray forming is recently considered to be a 
potential tool to produce advanced materials. It applies 
inert gas atomization of the liquid stream into variously 
sized droplets which are then propelled away form the 
region of atomization by fast flowing atomizing gas.2-6) 
Droplets are subsequently deposited and collected by a 
substrate on which solidification takes place. Finally a 
coherent and near fully dense preform is produced. The 
by-product micro-sized Mg powders produced during 
spray forming can also be utilized for the PM route.  
 
2. Experimental methods 
 
The AZ61 (Mg-5.88mass%Al-0.74mass%Zn) alloy, 
purchased from the CDN Company, Deltabc, Canada, 
was fabricated through semi-continuous casting. 
Amorphous SiO2 powders measuring ~20 nm and 
irregular in shape (Fig. 1(a)), with a density of 2.65 
Mg/m3, are introduced into AZ61 Mg alloys via spray 
forming, ingot or powder metallurgy routes, all followed 
by extrusion.   
Spray forming was conducted with the SiO2 nano 
particles pre-mixed in the AZ61 billet. Figure 2 shows 
the simplified schematic illustration of the SF facility. 
Then the billet with nano particles was spray formed 
under special control. An example is inserted in Fig. 2, 
with the dimension of 180 mm in diameter and 280 mm 
in height, the weight of 11.7 kg, and the density of 93% 
with respect to the theoretical density (or around 7 
volume percent in porosity). Short heating time before 
spray forming was to reduce the condensation of the 
nano particles during melting of the Mg alloys.  
While spray forming technique appears to be a 
promising fabrication method, it is difficult to insert a 
high amount of nano particles through the spray nozzle. 
Excessive nano particles would condense near the nozzle 
and block the spraying Mg melt. It follows that the ingot 
metallurgy (IM) and powder metallurgy (PM) methods 
are applied to fabricate composites with nano fillers 
greater than 1% in volume fraction (1 vol%).

extrusion to 100:1 at 300oC. The dark and larger particles 
in Fig. 5(a) are identified by EDS to be the Al4Mn 
particles, measuring from 0.1-0.8 µm and with an 
average size of ~0.2 µm. Few needle shaped particles are 
the Mg2Si phase, as a result of the phase transformation 
of SiO2 + 2Mg → 2MgO + Si, followed by 2Mg + Si → 
Mg2Si. The length of Mg2Si is typically around 0.3 µm 
(Table 2). In the background, there are some smaller and 
spherical particles in weak contrast. These are identified 
to be the individual or clustered amorphous SiO2 
particles. The amorphous nature of SiO2 makes the bright 
field image in weak contrast. The distribution of such 
nano SiO2 particles varies in different locations. But in 
most cases, they are in reasonably uniform dispersion, 
measuring from 20 to 100 nm in this SF composite 
(Table 2).  
In contrast, the second-phase particles in the IM 
and PM composites, particularly with higher SiO2 
volume fractions, are seen to disperse much less 
homogeneously. For example, Fig. 5(b) presents a severe 
cluster of the nano particles measuring around 500-1000 
nm in the 1% PM composite. By close examination of 
the enlarged TEM bright field image in Fig. 5(c), the 
black and strongly contrasted particles are identified to 
be the MgO phase, with a size for each individual fine 
particle of 5-10 nm. The grey and weakly contrasted 
particles measuring around 20-30 nm are the remaining 
amorphous SiO2. The associated diffraction pattern in 
Fig. 5(d) shows the strong rings originated from MgO 
with the weak halo background around the (000) center 
originated from the amorphous SiO2. Overall, around 
20% of the amorphous SiO2 in volume fraction has been 
transformed into crystalline MgO nano particles. In the 
PM composites, there are extra amounts of MgO formed 
on the AZ61 powder surfaces during spray forming.  
Based on the SEM and TEM phase analyses and 
quantitative measurements, there are various amounts of 
different phases, such as amorphous SiO2 (~20 nm in 
size and 100-1000 nm in cluster size), MgO (~5-10 nm), 
Mg2Si (~0.3 µm), and Al4Mn (~0.2 µm) in the processed 
composites. Due to the different working temperatures 
applied during the SF, IM and PM processes, the 
resulting sizes and volume fractions of such phases in 
these composites also vary accordingly. Table 2 
summarizes the average measured values. 
  
3.2 Mechancal properties 
 
The hardness and tensile results are summarized in 
Tables 1 and 3, respectively. The Hv Vicker’s hardness, 
yield stress (YS), and ultimate tensile stress (UTS) data 
on the processed composites all show different levels of 
strengthening with the addition of nano reinforcements, 
as compared with the as-received AZ61 billet. The 
strengthening is a result of both grain refinement and 
dispersion hardening, as analyzed in the next section. 
The PM composite with 1 vol% SiO2 possesses the 
highest YS (330 MPa) and UTS (379 MPa), due to the 
additional MgO oxides formed on the surface of AZ61 
Mg powders during spray forming. However, with higher 
SiO2 fillers to 3 and 5 vol%, even with continuous 
increment in hardness, the tensile YS and UTS start to 
decline appreciably as a result of more severe filler 
clustering.  
The tensile elongation of the SF composites (over 
30%) is higher than those of the AZ61 billet and all 
composites made by other routes, suggesting more 
uniform particle distribution. In contrast, the PM 
composites with 1 and 5 vol% SiO2 tend to exhibit low 
elongations of 4-7%, presumably also due to the ill 
bonding of the Mg powders which usually contain thin 
MgO layers on the powder surface formed during spray 
forming.

values can be compared with the experimentally 
measured YS, σexp, as listed in the last column of Table 5. 
It can be seen that for the AZ61 billet and the composites 
containing lower nano particle contents, the agreement 
between σtheo and σexp is reasonably good. However, for 
higher filler contents, especially for the 3% and 5% 
composites, the experimental data are significantly lower 
than the theoretical predictions. The comparison can be 
more readily seen from the plot in Fig. 6. The largest 
discrepancy occurs for the IM 3% and PM 5% 
composites, where σexp is lower than σtheo by 194 and 
181 MPa, respectively. The experimental observed yield 
strengths for these latter specimens are largely 
contributed by the grain size strengthening. The 
inclusion of 3-5 vol% nano particles into the AZ61 alloy 
did not lead to the effective hardening, obviously a result 
of more severe particle clustering.  
Since the Hall-Petch relationship is most likely to 
be obeyed in the AZ61 alloy and composites, it is 
meaningful to plot the experimental data on YS obtained 
from the AZ61 as-received billet, the SF, IM and PM 
composites against the d-1/2, as shown in Fig. 7(a). 
Although most of the composite yield stresses are above 
the theoretical prediction based on the AZ61 alloy matrix, 
there are still few data fall close or even lower than the 
predicted Hall-Petch line. The strengthening contribution 
from the nano second phases in various composites can 
be more readily seen from the net stress increment 
excluding the Hall-Petch contribution. This is done by 
linearly extracting the σHP from the experimental data 
σexp, and by plotting (σexp - σHP) against the SiO2 volume 
fraction, as presented in Fig. 7(b). This plot would reflect 
the net contribution from nano SiO2 and other resulting 
second phases as a function of the inserted SiO2 volume 
fraction. From Fig. 7(b), it can be seen that for the 0.2 
and 1 vol% specimens, the experimental data lie mostly 
close to or even above the theoretical prediction (the 
fitted solid line). However, the cases for the 3 and 5 
vol% are reversed. This means that the Orowan 
strengthening in the 3 and 5 vol% composites are not 
fully revealed, due to most likely the local clustering of 
nano SiO2 particles.  
In past, the metal matrix composites usually insert 
15-25 vol% micro-sized (1-20 µm) particulate 
reinforcements. The particle distribution with or without 
secondary rolling or extrusion are mostly satisfactory. 
However, the composites reinforced by the nano particles 
(5-30 nm) are subject to serious clustering problem when 
the volume fraction exceeding 3%. This ease in 
condensation of the nano particles during melting, 
coupled with the difficulty in flowing into uniform 
dispersion during solid-state plastic deformation, both 
lead to the cluster defect. For polymer matrix nano 
composites, the filler content can be added up to 10 
vol%,17) taking advantage of the viscous flow behavior 
above the glass transition temperature. Without such a 
characteristic in metals, it seems that a more rigorous 
plastic flow is needed. The current extrusion to an 
extrusion ratio of 100:1 did not seem to be sufficient. 
Other severe plastic deformation means such as equal 
channel angular extrusion or friction stir processing 
might be feasible. Recent trial of the same AZ61/SiO2 
composites prepared by four-pass friction stir processing 
has demonstrated the more promising results.18)
