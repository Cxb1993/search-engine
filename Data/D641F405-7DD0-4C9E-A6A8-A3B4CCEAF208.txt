Abstract—The nonlinear effects, known as transition shift and
partial erasure, arise and limit the performance of the detector in
a high-density magnetic recording channel. Although the partial
response maximum likelihood (PRML) sequence detector can
achieve an acceptable performance in a reasonable realization
complexity, the given target response is not optimal. In this
article, we jointly optimize the coefficients of the partial equalizer
and target response for a equalized maximum likelihood sequence
receiver such that the mean square error between the outputs
of the partial equalizer and target response is minimized in
the presence of the partial erasure effect, and evaluate the bit
error rates (BER’s) of the extended partial response class VI
(EPR4) equalized channel. In addition, the mean squared error
and bit error rate are simulated to verify the proposed method
for a EPR4-equalized channel; the results indicate both the mean
squared error and bit error rate for the proposed method are
improved as compared with those of the conventional design.

I. INTRODUCTION
As magnetic recording densities grow, the nonlinear ef-
fects, known as transition shift and partial erasure, arise
and limit the performance of the detector [1]-[4]; several
models have been presented to characterize the nonlinear
distortions [5]-[8]. It is known that if the channel model is
more complicated, the complexity of detector for the model
may be prohibitively higher [9]-[11]. Recently, the channel
is first equalized to a proper target response with a shorter
length, and the maximum likelihood sequence detector, often
realized by a Viterbi decoder (VD), is applied for retrieving
the storage data [12]-[15]. This approach is classified as
the partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) sequence
detection which can achieve an acceptable performance in a
reasonable realization complexity. Conventionally, the target
response is given, however, this is not optimal. The equalized
maximum likelihood sequence receiver is proposed [16], [17];
it jointly optimizes the coefficients of the partial equalizer
and target response, and then a Viterbi decoder is applied for
data detection. However, it ignores the nonlinearity. A partial
equalizer is required in designing a PRML detector, and the
design of the equalizer will directly affect the performance of
the corresponding Viterbi decoder. However, few researchers
have studied the design of the equalizer in the presence of
channel non-linearities. These nonlinear effects complicate the
statistics of the storage data, which makes the design of the
equalizer non-trivial and difficult. Fortunately, some primitive
results for the statistics of the storage data have been presented
[18], [19] with the assumption that the transition shift has been
eliminated by the write current precompensation [20], [21],
and the results can be extended to design a partial response
equalizer. In this article, we jointly optimize the coefficients
of the partial equalizer and target response such that the mean
square error between the outputs of the partial equalizer and
target response is minimized in the presence of the partial
erasure effect, and evaluate the bit error rates (BER’s) of the
extended partial response class VI (EPR4) equalized channel.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The simple
partial erasure model and classes of partial response are first
reviewed in section II. The design of equalized maximum
likelihood sequence receiver is given in section III. The
implementation of the Viterbi decoder is described in section
IV. Computer simulations are provided to verify the proposed
method in section V. Finally, conclusion is given in section
VI.
II. CHANNEL MODEL AND PARTIAL RESPONSES
Several channel models have been proposed to describe the
nonlinear effects of the magnetic recording channel; the simple
partial erasure channel is adopted in this article. Assume
that the nonlinear transition shift has been eliminated by the
precompensation technique. In terms of the simple partial
erasure model, the playback signal of a high-density recording
channel can be expressed as
y(t) =
∑
k
rkbkh(t− kT ) (1)
31) × (N − 1), respectively, and the (i, j) elements of Q¯ and
B¯ are
Q¯(i, j) =

1
2 + γ1 +
1
2γ2 , if |i− j + (N1 + L1 + 1)| = 0− 12γ1 − 12γ2 , if |i− j + (N1 + L1 + 1)| = 1− 14 + 14γ2 , if |i− j + (N1 + L1 + 1)| = 2
0 , else
(16)
and
B¯(i, j) =
 2 , if |i− j| = 0−1 , if |i− j| = 10 , else (17)
The matrix representation of the minimum mean square
error J(p¯, q) is given by
J(p¯, q) = E[(bm + p¯T b¯m − qTHrm − qTnm)2]
= E[b2m] + p¯T b¯
′
m − qTHr′m + b¯′m
T
p¯
+ p¯T B¯p¯− p¯T Q¯HTq − qTHr′m + qTHQ¯T p¯
− qTHRHTq + qTNq (18)
where the noise nm is assumed identically independently
distributed (IID) with standard deviation σ, and the noise
matrix N is defined by E[nmnTm]. The (i, j) element of the
matrix N is denoted by N(i, j) and given by
N(i, j) = E[nm(i)nm(j)]
= E[nm+N1+1−inm+N1+1−j ]
=
{
σ2 , i = j
0 , i 6= j (19)
To minimize the cost function (18), let the gradients of J(p¯, q)
with respect to p¯ and q equal zero. The gradients of J(p¯, q)
are given by{
∇p¯J(q, p¯) = 2b¯′m + 2B¯p¯− 2Q¯HTq
∇qJ(q, p¯) = −2Hr′m − 2HQ¯T p¯+ 2HRHTq + 2Nq
(20)
Define the augmented vector z and u and matrix G as
z =
[
p¯
q
]
(21)
and
u =
[
−b¯′m
Hr′m
]
(22)
and
G =
[
B¯ −Q¯HT
−HQ¯T HRHT +N
]
(23)
Then, the optimum solution is given by
z = G−1u (24)
IV. VITERBI DECODER MATCHED TO THE EQUALIZED
TARGET RESPONSE
A maximum likelihood sequence detector, often realized by
the Viterbi decoder (VD), is applied for retrieving the storage
data in this article. As recording density increases, a higher
order partial response is adopted. In this section, we examine
the Viterbi detector for the EPR4-equalized channel. The trellis
diagram that is matched to the EPR4 target response is shown
in Fig. 2, and its detailed values are also given in Table I.
The present state is defined as {bm−2, bm−1}, bm represents
the input, and thus the next state is {bm−1, bm}. For example,
when the present state {bm−2, bm−1} is {0, 2}, and the input
bm = −2, the corresponding output is evaluated by ym =
p0bm + p1bm−1 + p2bm−2 = −2 + 2p1 and the next state
{bm−1, bm} is translated to be {2,−2}. Note that p0 = 1 and
there are 7 state for the EPR4-equalized channel.
