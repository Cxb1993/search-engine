substrate-mediated viral vector delivery. We conjugated rAAV2 to an epoxy-crosslinked 
heparin cellulose membrane, which led to vector transduction upon cellular adhesion. When 
adhered, human fibroblasts exhibited proliferation kinetics similar to those on the standard 
polystyrene tissue-culture surface. Using fluorescent proteins as the reporter, we showed that 
the heparin-bound rAAV2 particles remained active and that the rAAV2-heparin binding was 
reversible and capable of mediating transgene delivery in cell culture. In addition, we applied 
the affinity membrane to adsorb unpurified rAAV2 from the crude lysate of packaging cells 
via the ligand-receptor binding, avoiding the use of conventional ultracentrifugation or 
chromatography in preparation of infectious rAAV2 for transduction. Our work explores a 
new application of affinity cellulose membranes in substrate-mediated viral vector delivery, 
which can be a useful tool in developing protocols for localized gene transfer.  
 
 
 
Topic Two Abstract: 
 
We investigated the use of heparinized cellulose matrices (H-CM) as affinity substrates 
for binding of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a heparin-binding peptide, to facilitate 
cellular proliferation and substrate-mediated transgene delivery. Using human HT-1080 
fibroblasts and Saos-2 osteoblasts as cellular models, we showed that H-CM was a friendly 
substrate for cellular adhesion. Once adhered, cells received stimulation from the bound 
bFGF, leading to enhanced proliferation. Furthermore, taking advantage of the negative zeta 
potential of H-CM, we applied electrostatic adsorption to immobilize cationic 
poly-ethylenimine/DNA polyplexes onto the surface for transgene delivery upon cellular 
adhesion. Because bFGF stimulated cellular proliferation, we observed a significant increase 
in transfection efficiency in comparison to transfection on H-CM without the bFGF binding. 
We showed that H-CM was capable of mediating both bFGF peptide and bFGF transgene 
delivery to induce a synergistic stimulation of cellular proliferation, thus offering a useful 
device for fabrication of tissue scaffolds.

have incorporated growth factors with scaffolds to
design devices to enhance tissue regeneration. Two
major approaches have been implemented to associ-
ate growth factors with the tissue scaffold. First,
growth factors were bound with scaffolds to stimulate
cellular proliferation (Silva et al. 2009; Wang et al.
2008b; Edlund et al. 2008; Yao et al. 2006).
Heparinized collagen scaffolds and small intestinal
submucosa (Brown-Etris et al. 2002), for example,
have affinity toward growth factors such as basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endo-
thelial growth factor (VEGF) to stimulate cellular
proliferation and vascular development upon cellular
adhesion. Second, growth factors were produced
from the genetically modified cells on the scaffolds.
In this approach, viral (Ito et al. 2005; Yue et al.
2007) or non-viral (Pannier and Shea 2004; Tseng
et al. 2008; Lim et al. 2006) vectors carrying the
growth factor-encoding gene were immobilized on
the tissue substrate, where, upon adhesion/infiltration,
cells were transduced or transfected to produce
growth factors. However, to the best of authors’
knowledge, neither of the two approaches has been
applied simultaneously to stimulate cellular prolifer-
ation on the cellulose scaffold.
In the present study, we intend to associate the
growth factor bFGF with cellulose matrices using
both of the above mentioned approaches. Taking
advantage of the well-developed fabrication tech-
niques of cellulose in the filtration industry, we
applied affinity cellulose membranes for binding of
growth factors onto the matrices. Affinity membranes
offer an efficient and reliable method to purify
biomolecules of interest (Klein 2000; van Reis and
Zydney 2007; Wang et al. 2008a). We, however,
explored a different application of the growth factor-
bound affinity membrane as a substrate for cellular
adhesion and proliferation. In addition, we used the
negatively charged cellulose membrane to adsorb the
cationic polymer-DNA polyplexes, which carry the
growth factor-encoding gene, for substrate-mediated
transfection (Lim et al. 2006; Bengali et al. 2009).
We showed that the affinity cellulose matrices were
capable of mediating both the peptide and transgene
delivery of the growth factor. In this study, we
present and discuss the results using heparinized
cellulose matrices (H-CM) as the affinity substrate for
binding of bFGF, a heparin-binding peptide, to
facilitate cellular proliferation and bFGF transfection.
Materials and methods
Materials and chemicals
The epoxy-crosslinked H-CM and blank cellulose
matrices were supplied by Sartorius AG (Go¨ttingen,
Germany; membrane of regenerated cellulose acetate).
The human recombinant bFGF (16 kDa) and the
bFGF immunoassay kit (Quantikine) were purchased
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The
CellTiter 96 AQueous one solution (MTS assay) and
the luciferase assay system were purchased from
Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Branched poly-ethy-
lenimine (PEI, 25 kDa) was purchased from Aldrich
(Milwaukee, WI, USA). Phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were
purchased from Sigma Co. (St Louis, MO, USA).
Cell culture
Human HT-1080 fibroblasts (ATCC, cell line number
CCL-121, Manassas, VA, USA) and human Saos-2
osteoblasts (ATCC, cell line number HTB-85) were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/mL streptomycin.
Cell cultures were maintained at 37 C in a 5% CO2
and 95% air humidified atmosphere.
Imaging of cellular adhesion
Cells were examined by scanning electron micros-
copy (SEM) to assess cellular adhesion 1 day after
the HT-1080 fibroblasts and Saos-2 osteoblasts
(2 9 105) were seeded onto the H-CM or blank
cellulose membrane (1 cm 9 1 cm). In this analysis,
cellulose membranes with cells were washed with
PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
20 min. Afterwards, samples were dehydrated in 50,
70, 90, and 100% ethanol solutions for 15 min twice
at each concentration. Samples were then vacuum-
dried and coated with gold by ion sputtering prior to
being examined by a JEOL, JSM-5600 (Tokyo,
Japan) scanning electron microscope.
Assessment of bFGF binding to H-CM
The binding test was conducted by incubating 1 ng/lL
of bFGF (in PBS with 0.1% BSA) with one piece
Cellulose
123
(Tseng et al. 2008). The amount of DNA adsorbed
onto the membrane was determined from the differ-
ence between the feed DNA and the residual DNA in
solution.
In addition, the PEI/DNA polyplexes formed by a
CyTM3-labeled plasmid DNA (Mirus Bio, Madison,
WI, USA) were used to visualize the adsorption
process. The binding of the PEI/DNA-CyTM3 fluo-
rescent dye to the membrane was examined by a
Nikon TS100 microscope equipped with an epifluo-
rescence attachment. A Nikon G-2A filter set (EX
510-560, DM 575, BA 590) was applied for fluores-
cence detection.
Substrate-mediated transfection of PEI/DNA
polyplexes
After the PEI/DNA polyplexes were adsorbed onto
the matrices, the devices were placed in the wells of a
24-well tissue-culture plate and subsequently seeded
with human HT-1080 fibroblasts (2 9 105) for cel-
lular adhesion and transfection. Reporter plasmids
pGL3-Control (a luciferase expression plasmid) and
pCMV-EGFP were used, and reporter analysis was
performed 48 h post transfection to assess the
efficiency. The activity of luciferase was measured
with the luciferase assay system (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s protocols and with a 20/20n
Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). Confocal microscopy of cells on the cellulose
membrane followed the tissue imaging method
previously described (Fu et al. 2009). Briefly,
reporter EGFP expression was visualized using a
Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
GmbH Jena, Germany) with an argon laser at 488 nm
excitation and a band-pass, 505–530-nm filter. The
cells transfected with PEI/pCMV-EGFP polyplexes
were stained by propidium iodide (PI, 62.5 (g/mL,
Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) overnight to
label the nuclei.
In addition, we applied PEI/pCMV-bFGF poly-
plexes in substrate-mediated transfection to test the
influence of bFGF transgene expression on cellular
proliferation. The PEI/pAAV-LacZ. (Stratagene, La

We next applied immunogold-silver staining to
confirm the adsorption of bFGF on H-CM. Figure 2b
shows that the bFGF-bound H-CM exhibited diffuse
gold-silver deposits after staining. By contrast, only
sparse signals from the nonspecific binding between
bFGF and the blank cellulose matrices were observed
(Fig. 2c). In another control staining, we observed
only background signals from H-CM in the absence
of bFGF.
Bound bFGF on H-CM stimulates cellular
proliferation
To study the influence of bound bFGF on cellular
proliferation, we applied an MTS cell proliferation
assay to compare the proliferation kinetics of human
HT-1080 fibroblasts and Saos-2 osteoblasts on the
bFGF-bound H-CM to those on the H-CM without
bFGF binding (control), blank cellulose matrices
(control), and tissue-culture polystyrene surfaces
(control). Figure 3 shows that for both HT-1080
fibroblasts and Saos-2 osteoblasts, when H-CM was
used without the bFGF binding, cells on the matrices
exhibited similar proliferation kinetics as those on the
tissue-culture polystyrene surface. Also, among the
test conditions, the fastest proliferation rates were
from the cells grown on the bFGF-bound H-CM for
both cell types. This result indicated that the bound
bFGF was active on H-CM to stimulate proliferation.
Electrostatic adsorption of polyplexes onto H-CM
In addition to the affinity bFGF binding with H-CM,
we next sought to apply electrostatic adsorption to
immobilize bFGF transgene onto H-CM for de novo
bFGF production from the transfected cells. We first
measured the surface zeta potential of H-CM using a
streaming potential method (Tseng et al. 2008; Fievet
et al. 2003; Hunter 1981) and obtained a negative
surface charge at -17 mV at neutral pH. We then
applied the cationic poly-ethylenimine (PEI)/DNA
polyplexes (zeta potential at ?20 mV) as the gene-
transfer vectors and studied their adsorption onto
H-CM. Figure 4a compares the adsorption kinetics
between the bFGF-bound H-CM and the H-CM
without bFGF binding. The result showed that the

staining was used to reveal the nuclei. Because PI
carries a positive charge at neutral pH, the PI staining
also served as a counterstain to visualize the nega-
tively charged cellulose matrices in the background.
Figure 5b shows a representative view of the genet-
ically modified cells on the bFGF-bound H-CM. The
results of PI staining and the diffuse EGFP expression
are shown in the left and middle sections of Fig. 5b,
respectively, indicating a successful transfection of
the target cells. The merged image of PI staining and
EGFP expression (Fig. 5b, right) shows that the
transfection efficiency was in the 60–70% range.
These results demonstrated that the adsorbed PEI/
DNA polyplexes were active on H-CM and the
efficiency of polyplexes-mediated transfection was
largely improved in the presence of bFGF.
Joint stimulation of bFGF peptide and bFGF
transgene expression on cellular proliferation
We next used the bFGF transgene to replace the
reporter gene in the transfection study and measured
the production of bFGF from the transfected
HT-1080 cells. In this test, transfection was carried
out on the standard tissue-culture polystyrene wells,
instead of H-CM, to minimize the association of the

In this research we applied the Sartobind heparin cellulose
membrane (Sartorius AG, Go¨ttingen, Germany) as the affinity
substrate for rAAV2 binding. The microporous cellulose mem-
brane provides large internal surfaces for rAAV2 binding and
cellular adhesion/infiltration. In addition, the biocompatibility
of cellulose and its derivatives has long been recognized
[16–19]. Because the mechanical properties of cellulose can
be engineered to match those of hard and soft tissues, studies
have focused on using cellulose as the scaffold for bone and
cartilage tissue engineering, connective tissue regeneration, and
cultivation of functional cardiac cell constructs [17,18,20–23].
This report presents and discusses the results of using H-CM
to initiate rAAV2 binding and transgene delivery upon cellular
adhesion.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture
Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293, ATCC, Manas-
sas, VA, USA) cells were used for rAAV2 production. Human
HT-1080 fibroblasts (ATCC) and human Saos-2 osteoblasts
(ATCC) were used as targets for rAAV2 transduction. These
cell lines were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100g/ml streptomycin. Cell cultures were
maintained at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified
atmosphere.
2.2. Cellular adhesion and kinetics of cell proliferation on
H-CM
One day after HT-1080 fibroblasts were seeded onto H-CM
(Sartorius AG, Go¨ttingen, Germany, heparinized membrane
of regenerated cellulose acetate, Cat# 94HEP-00-001) and the
standard polystyrene tissue-culture surface (control, Corning
Inc., Acton, MA, USA), a staining kit of actin filaments
(Chemicon, Cat# FAK100, Temecula, CA, USA) consisting
of tetramethylrhodamine-isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated
phalloidin was used to reveal the actin cytoskeleton in cells.
The stained actin filaments were imaged by a Nikon TS100
microscope configured with an epifluorescence attachment
and a Nikon G-2A filter set (EX 510-560, DM 575, BA 590).
Cells on H-CM were also examined by the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). In this analysis, H-CM with cells was
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M, pH 7.4,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde
for 20 min. After the fixation, the sample was washed twice
with PBS, and then dehydrated in 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%
ethanol solutions for 15 min twice at each concentration.
Afterwards, the sample was vacuum-dried and coated with gold
by ion sputtering prior to examination by SEM using a JEOL
(Tokyo, Japan) JSM-5600 model.
The mitochondrial activity in fibroblasts seeded onto H-CM
was measured over time by the CellTiter 96 AQueous one solu-
tion cell proliferation assay system (an MTS assay, Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) [24]. Cells seeded onto the blank cellu-
lose membrane, i.e., cellulose without the crosslinked heparin
molecules, and the standard polystyrene tissue-culture sur-
face were used as controls. In this cell viability/proliferation
assay, the methoxyphenyl-tetrazolium salt (MTS) compound
was reduced by viable cells to form a colored formazan prod-
uct, which was quantified colorimetrically at 490 nm using a
spectrofluorometer to determine the optical density. Parallel cell
cultures were sacrificed at time = 0.25, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days to mea-
sure the mitochondrial activity. A calibration curve of known cell
number versus optical density was prepared to determine the cell
number of the sample.
2.3. Viral vector preparation
Plasmid pAAV-LacZ (Supplementary Fig. 1A), carrying the
expression cassette of -galactosidase flanked by AAV2 ITRs
(inverted terminal repeats), was purchased from Stratagene (La
Jolla, CA, USA). Plasmid pAAV-EGFP (Supplementary Fig.
1B) and pAAV-luciferase (Supplementary Fig. 1C) was con-
structed by cloning the 0.8-kb EGFP cDNA from pEGFP-N2
(Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) and the 1.7-kb firefly
luciferase cDNA from pGL3-control (Promega), respectively,
downstream from the CMV promoter in pAAV-MCS (Strata-
gene). Production, purification, and titration of rAAV2 were
performed as previously described using the AAV Helper-
Free System (Stratagene) [25]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were
co-transfected with the rAAV2 vector plasmid, along with
pAAV-RC (Stratagene) and pHelper (Stratagene). For each 100-
mm dish, HEK293 cells were transfected with 2.5 mg of each
of the three plasmids and 15 ml of FUGENE 6 reagent (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col. Transfected cells were harvested 3 days after transfection.
Purification of rAAV2 particles followed the protocol devel-
oped by Auricchio et al. using a single-step heparin column
chromatography [15]. Titration of infectious rAAV2 particles
(infectious units (IU)) was performed according to the protocol
of the AAV Helper-Free System (Stratagene) using HT-1080
cells as targets for transduction. The number of IU per micro-
liter of viral stock for each batch of virus production ranged
from 105 to 107. The purified rAAV2 particles were stored in the
−80 ◦C freezer until use in the H-CM binding and transduction
experiments.
Alternatively, the H-CM-mediated transduction was also car-
ried out using unpurified crude lysate of packaging cells. To
prepare the unpurified crude lysate, cells were scraped from
culture surfaces and suspended in DMEM. The suspension
then went through two rounds of freeze (−80 ◦C) and thaw
(37 ◦C), followed by the addition of DNase I and RNase A
(Roche) into the suspension and incubation at 37 ◦C for 30 min.
Large cellular debris and the lysate were separated by centrifu-
gation at 1000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred
into a 50-ml conical tube and incubated with 0.5% deoxy-
cholic acid (Sigma) at 37 ◦C for 30 min. Small cellular debris
was removed by filtering the lysate through a 5-mm pore
size filter and then through a 0.8-mm pore size filter. Per-
meates were collected and stored in the −80 ◦C freezer until
use.

HT-1080 monolayer (in one well of a six-well dish) to separate
the rAAV2-bound H-CM (donor compartment) and the permis-
sive HT-1080 cells (recipient compartment). Supplementary Fig.
2 shows a schematic of the arrangement.
The substrate-mediated transduction was also carried out
using unpurified crude lysate of packaging cells. To assess the
effect of pH on the binding of rAAV2 to H-CM, 40l of cleared
crude lysate were added into a phosphate buffer solution (4 ml)
at pH values of 5, 6, 7.4, 8, and 9 (through adjusting the relative
amounts of 0.2 M NaH2PO4 and 0.2 M Na2HPO4). The activ-
ity of the bound rAAV2 was evaluated by seeding the HT-1080
fibroblasts onto H-CM for rAAV2-luciferase transduction upon
cellular adhesion (at pH 7.4, in culture medium) as described in
the previous paragraph. The test was also conducted with differ-
ent volumes of cleared crude lysate at 0, 4, 10, 20, 40, 100l at
pH 7.4. Cells were cultured for 5 days before luciferase reporter
analysis.
2.7. Assays
Toluidine blue staining was used to reveal the crosslinked
heparin on the cellulose membrane matrices. In this test, H-
CM was immersed in a solution of toluidine blue (0.1 M HCl,
2 mg/ml NaCl, 0.4 mg/ml toluidine blue, Sigma) for 4 h to
develop toluidine blue precipitates on the membrane. Staining
of the blank cellulose membrane was used as control.
Activities of the reporters-galactosidase and luciferase were
measured with the Beta-Glo assay system (Promega) and the
luciferase assay system (Promega), respectively, according to
the manufacturer’s protocols and with a 20/20n Luminome-
ter (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The reporter
-galactosidase was also evaluated by X-gal staining. In this

that when adsorbed with rAAV2, the H-CM exhibited diffuse
gold–silver deposits after staining, relative to the sparse back-
ground signals from the control staining in the absence of
rAAV2. This result confirmed the affinity binding of rAAV2 with
H-CM, as shown in Fig. 3A. Microscopically, the immobilized
rAAV2 particles were not evenly distributed in H-CM as revealed
by the enlarged micrograph of the immunogold–silver staining
shown in Fig. 3C. Interestingly, a previous study using confocal
microscopy to map the distribution of lysozyme binding to the
negatively charged Sartorius S chromatography membrane also
displayed “clustered” signals in some areas, whereas the signals
in other areas were significantly lower [27].
3.4. Recombinant AAV2 transduction mediated by H-CM
Adsorption of rAAV2 particles onto H-CM did not necessar-
ily indicate that these viruses remained active and were available
for substrate-mediated vector delivery. To evaluate the activ-
ity of the bound rAAV2 particles, we seeded human HT-1080
fibroblasts onto H-CM for transgene delivery after rAAV2 con-

fluorescence-positive cells could be seen under the same view by adjusting the focus; these appear vaguely in the background. (B) X-gal staining of transduced HT-
1080 fibroblasts using -galactosidase as the reporter. Bar = 100m. (C) Adhesion and proliferation of human Saos-2 osteoblasts on H-CM. Osteoblasts were stained
with alkaline phosphatase activity using Sigma FastTM fast red TR/naphthol AS-MX as the substrate to produce intense red stains. Bar = 100m. (D) Expression
of EGFP in human Saos-2 osteoblasts after H-CM-mediated rAAV2 transduction. Bar = 100m. (E) Relative efficiency of transduction when the rAAV2-loaded
H-CM and HT-1080 fibroblasts were separated by a NetwellTM polyester membrane with 0.5-mm mesh size (indirect contact) or by direct seeding of cells onto the
membrane matrices (direct contact). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Bars indicate standard deviation.
