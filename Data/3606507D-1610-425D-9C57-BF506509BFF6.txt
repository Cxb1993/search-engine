Abstract—Let F denote the faulty vertices in an 
n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn. In this paper, we show 
that FQn contains a fault-free path with length of at least 2
n
  
2|F|  1 (respectively, 2n  2|F|  2) between two arbitrary 
vertices x and y of odd (respectively, even) Hamming distance in 
FQn  F if |F|  n  1, where n  3. Since FQn is (n + 1)-regular 
and is bipartite when n is odd, both the number of faults 
tolerated and the length of a longest fault-free path obtained are 
worst-case optimal.

I. INTRODUCTION 
he hypercube is one of the most versatile and efficient 
interconnection networks (networks for short) 
discovered to date for parallel computation. The hypercube 
is ideally suited to both special-purpose and 
general-purpose tasks, and can efficiently simulate many 
other same sized networks [15]. We usually use Qn to 
denote an n-dimensional hypercube. Many variants of the 
hypercube have been proposed. One variant is the folded 
hypercube [1]. An n-dimensional folded hypercube, 
denoted by FQn, is an extension of Qn, constructed by 
adding a link to every pair of nodes with complementary 
addresses. The folded hypercube is superior to the 
hypercube in many measurements, such as diameter, fault 
diameter, connectivity, and so on (see [1], [22]). Previous 
works relating to the folded hypercube can be found in [1], 
[4], [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [16], [17], [18], [19], [22], 
[24], [25], [26]. 
An embedding of one guest graph G into another host 
graph H is a one-to-one mapping f from the node set of G to 
the node set of H [15]. An edge of G corresponds to a path 
of H under f. Linear arrays and rings, which are two of the 
most fundamental networks for parallel and distributed 
computation, are suitable for designing simple algorithms 
with low communication costs. Numerous efficient 
algorithms designed on linear arrays and rings for solving 
various algebraic problems and graph problems can be 
found in [15]. Linear arrays and rings can also be used as 
control/data flow structures for distributed computation in 
arbitrary networks. All of these motivate the embedding of 
linear arrays and rings in networks. 
The fault-tolerant problem has been one of the most 
important studies on interconnection networks since faults

fault-tolerant embedding on Qn or FQn can be found in [2], 
[3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [12], [13], [14], [20], [21], 
[22], [23]. Let F denote the faulty vertices in an 
n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn. In this paper, we 
show that FQn contains a fault-free path with length of at 
least 2n  2|F|  1 (respectively, 2n  2|F|  2) between two 
arbitrary vertices x and y of odd (respectively, even) 
Hamming distance in FQn  F if |F|  n  1, where n  3. 
Since FQn is (n + 1)-regular and bipartite when n is odd [24], 
both the number of faults tolerated and the length of a 
longest fault-free path obtained are worst-case optimal.  
II. PRELIMINARIES. 
Let G be a graph and let u, v  V(G). We use (u, v) to 
denote an edge whose endpoints are u and v. A path P[x0, xt] 
= x0, x1, , xt is a sequence of nodes such that two 
consecutive nodes are adjacent. Moreover, a path x0, x1, , 
xt may contain other subpaths, denoted as x0, x1, , xi, P[xi, 
xj], xj, , xt, where P[xi, xj] = xi, xi+1, ,xj–1 , xj. A cycle is a 
path with x0 = xt and t  3. 
An n-cube is an undirected graph with 2n nodes each 
labeled with a distinct binary string b1b2…bn. Nodes 
b1…bi…bn and b1… ib …bn are joined by an edge along 
dimension i, where 1  i  n and 
ib  represents the one 
complement of bi. Moreover, suppose x = x1x2…xn and y = 
y1y2…yn. In the rest of the paper, x
(i) is used to denote the 
binary string x1…
ix …xn and dH(x, y) is used to denote the 
Hamming distance between x and y, namely, the number of 
different bits between x and y.  
An n-dimensional folded hypercube FQn is Qn 
augmented by adding more links among its nodes. More 
specifically, FQn is obtained by adding a link between two 
nodes whose addresses are complementary to each other in 
Qn; i.e., for a node whose address is b = b1b2…bn, it has one 
more link to connect to node 
nbbbb ...21 , in addition to its 
original n links. So FQn has 2
n–1 more links than a regular 
links. Fig. 1 illustrates a 2-dimensional and a 3-dimensional 
folded hypercubes.

Case 2: x  0
1nQ  , y 
1
1nQ  . Two cases are further 
considered: 
Case 2.1: |F0|  n – 3. It is not difficult to see that n  5; for 
otherwise |F0|  n  3  1 < (n  1)  (n  3) = 2 = |F1|, which 
contradicts to the assumption that |F1|  |F0|. Let u  
0
1nQ    
{x}  F0 such that dH(x, u) is odd and u
(j)  1
1nQ    F1  {y}
‡. 
By Lemma 1, there exists a path P[x, u] of length at least 
2n–1  2|F0|  1 in 
0
1nQ    F0. Moreover, By Lemma 1 there 
exists a path P[y, u(j)] of length at least 2n–1  2|F1|  1 
(respectively, 2n–1  2|F1|  2), if dH(y, u
(j)) is odd 
(respectively, even) in 1 1nQ    F1. Clearly, dH(x, y) is odd if 
and only if dH(y, u
(j)) is odd. Thus, x, P[x, u], u, u(j), P[u(j), 
y], y is a path with length of at least (2n–1  2|F0|  1) + 1 + 
(2n–1  2|F1|  1) = 2
n  2(|F0| + |F1|)  1 = 2
n  2|F|  1 
(respectively, 2n  2|F|  2) if dH(x, y) is odd (respectively, 
even) (see Fig. 3(a)).  
Case 2.2: |F0| = n – 2 (i.e., |F1| = 1). We have two scenarios 
as follows: 
Case 2.2.1: n = 3. We have |F0| = |F1| = 1. Without loss of 
generality, let x = 000. The desired path P[x, y] are listed 
below:

‡ Let V = {z | dH(x, z) is odd, z  V(
0
1nQ  )}. Note that |V| = 2
n–2. If none of 
the vertices in 
0
1nQ   meets the requirements of such a vertex u, then V = F0  
{w | w(j)  F1}  {y
(j)}. As a result, |V| = 2n–2 = | F0  {w | w
(j)  F1}  {y
(j)}| 
 |F0| + |{w | w
(j)  F1}| + |{y
(j)}| = |F0| + |F1| + |{y
(j)}| = (n – 1) + 1 = n, which 
is a contradiction. Therefore, we can always find such a vertex u.

Case 2.2.2: n  4. Remember that |F1| = 1. Assume that F1 = 
{g}. First, consider that only one neighbor of x in 0 1nQ   is 
not in F0; that is, n – 2 neighbors of x in 
0
1nQ   are in F0. By 
Lemma 2, there exist two path P[x, r] and P[x, w] with 
length at least 2n–1  2(n – 2) in 0 1nQ    F0 such that dH(x, r) 
= dH(x, w) = 2.  
If r(j)  w  and w(j)  r , then |{r(j), r , w(j), w }| = 4. 
We have {r(j), r }  {g, y} or {w(j), w }  {g, y}. Let z  {r, 
w} such that {z(j), z }  {g, y} and let z'  {z(j), z }  {g, y}. 
Note that dH(x, z) = 2 and dH(z, z') = 1. Thus, we have dH(x, 
z') is odd. Consequently, if dH(x, y) is even (respectively, 
odd), then dH(y, z') is odd (respectively, even). By Lemma 1, 
there exists a path P[y, z'] of length at least 2n–1  2  1  1 
(respectively, 2n  2  1  2) in 1 1nQ    F1. Thus, x, P[x, z], 
z, z', P[z', y], y is a path with length of at least (2n–1  2(n –
