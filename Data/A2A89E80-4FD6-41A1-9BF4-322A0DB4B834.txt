1. Introduction 
Sheet metal bending is one of the most important metalworking processes in many industries, particularly 
the automobile industry. However, major defects such as springback and failure can occur during sheet 
bending. Considerable efforts have been made to improve the understanding of this process such as [1-5]. 
Although much progress has been made, further theoretical development and experimentation is needed to 
enable practical applications of these findings. 
Because of its high strength and low cost compared to other conventional metals, HSS (high strength steel) 
is widely used in automotive body structures, especially to reduce weight, which then reduces energy use. 
The most important sheet bending process is V-die bending process in which flanges on each side are of 
unequal size is called asymmetric V-die bending. The practical industrial demands of assembly and 
multi-forming in precision devices have increased the use of asymmetric bending. However, two common 
defects that commonly occur in asymmetric bending are (1) an incorrectly positioned bending point in the 
center part of the punch causing a difference in contact friction force and contact area on both contact sides, 
i.e., position deviation, and (2) a difference in bent flange length producing a different bent angle after 
unloading on both sides for the different loading path and contact friction. Until now, practical solutions for 
these problems have not been reported. 
Moreover, asymmetric V-die bending process is a nonlinear problem of plasticity. The complexity results 
from the high nonlinearity of large deformations such as (1) complex geometric changes due to large 
displacements, rotations and strains, (2) nonlinear constitutive behaviors of materials due to the inelastic 
characteristics of large deformations and (3) variation in the nonlinear characteristics of 
deformation-dependent boundary conditions throughout the loading process. Because of these factors, 
simulating the deformation process is extremely difficult. The finite-element method is considered an 
essential tool because of its flexibility and accuracy. It overcomes the complexities of both geometric and 
material nonlinear problems, and it effectively models highly nonlinear contact boundary conditions. 
Therefore, this study attempts to clarify some basic characteristics of asymmetric V-die bending processes 
for HSS sheet by using finite element analysis and a series of experiments. To enable practical application, a 
major objective is to determine how to control the position of the bending point and how to modify both bent 
angles identically. The effect of process parameters on position deviation and springback is also studied. The 
experiments show that all these parameters affect position deviation and springback, but in different ways. 
This study proposes methods of minimizing these defects in order to obtain a precise asymmetric bent 
component. Accordingly, this study could be used as the tooling design guideline for stamping of HSS. 
 
2. Basic Analysis 
2.1 Variational principle 
The updated Lagrangian formulation (ULF) pioneered by McMeeking and Rice [6] is considered the best 
formulation for describing the incremental characteristics of plastic flow under deformation. At each time 
instant, the reference state is updated to coincide with the current deformation state. By using the Jaumann 
rate of Cauchy stress, the rate equation for virtual work can be expressed in updated Lagrangian form as

where )( kjikkjikij

)( jiij XvL ∂∂=  denotes the velocity gradient, iv  is the velocity, if&  is the rate of the nominal traction, 
V is the material volume and fS  is the surface on which the traction is prescribed. 
2.2 Constitutive model 
This work assumed the following elasto-plastic constitutive relations: (1) elastic behavior: isotropic and 
linear elasticity with small strain and (2) plastic behavior: rate independent, isotropic strain hardening, von 
Mises yield function and associative flow rule. The constitutive relation, which incorporates small

where nuΔ  is a prescribed displacement increment of the contact node in the normal direction of contact 
boundary ( θcos⋅ΔU ), i denotes the current incremental step and i-1 denotes the previous incremental step. 
In the solution scheme, the incremental change in friction force on the contact node is calculated iteratively. 
2.5 Weighting factor minr  for the increment of each loading step 
During each increment, the material is referred to its configuration at the beginning of the increment 
(updated Lagrangian scheme). The contact and separation conditions of nodes and the state of elements must 
remain constant during the increment. To meet this requirement and to ensure the accuracy of this explicit 
integration scheme (static explicit formulation), the weighting factor minr  proposed by Yamada et al. [8] is 
used in the elasto-plastic and contact-separation problems to calculate the size of the increment needed to 
maintain the linear relation. The size of each loading step is determined by the smallest value of minr = 
MIN{ 1r , 2r , 3r , 4r , 5r } in which 1r : to ascertain the equivalent stress of elastic elements that have just 
reached the current yield surface; 2r : to limit the largest equivalent strain increment to linear relation; 3r : 
to limit the rotation increment to linear relation; 4r : to enable a free node that only contacts the tools and 5r : 
to enable a contact node that only departs from the tool surface. The above is consistent with the first order 
theory. Detailed information about weighting factor minr  can be found in [9]. 
2.6 Unloading process 
To determine the final shape or the springback behavior, the unloading process is executed by assuming 
that the properties of all elements are reset to elastic. The force of the contact node is reversed so that it 
becomes the prescribed force boundary condition. All tools are removed for the elastic unloading procedure. 
2.7 FEM simulation of asymmetric V-die bending 
Figure 1 shows the asymmetric V-die bending model. The dimensions of the simulated tools are W = 36 
mm, Rd = 3 mm and Rp = 6 mm, and the simulated HSS material are adopted from [10]. The simulation 
assumes a friction coefficient of 1.0=μ . Figure 2 shows the simulation results for asymmetric V-die 
bending processes. The black area shows plastic deformation, and the arrows show the direction of material 
flow during bending. 
The area of plastic deformation (black area in Fig.2 (a)) is symmetrically distributed over the region under 
the punch during the early stage of bending. The deformation is then distributed towards the side with the 
short length during final stage. The extent of bending, however, is clearly greater in the long length than in 
the short length. In Fig.2 (a), checkpoint A, which was marked on the bottom of punch in the central line (U 
= 0.0 mm) before bending, has obviously moved to the side with the long length after bending (U = 15.6 
mm), which clearly shows the position deviation phenomenon in asymmetric bending. The position deviation 
e is defined as movement of point A. 
Accordingly, a springback phenomenon occurs during unloading. In the last line drawing in Fig.2 (b), the 
arrows on both sides of the node, i.e. the directions of displacement increment of node, point in an outward 
direction due to elastic recovery during unloading. Moreover, the deviation processes of asymmetric bending 
can be seen from the varying distribution of node displacement. In Fig.2 (b), the directions of arrows of 
nodes under the central part of punch from U = 8.0 mm to 15.6 mm show that the nodes gradually move to 
the side with the longest length as bending proceeds, and the most movement occurs in the last step of U = 
15.6 mm since the gap between the punch and die is equal to the sheet thickness. The FE simulation is a 
powerful tool for accurately depicting processes and variations in deviation during asymmetric bending.

4. Conclusions 
This work proposed a novel method of analyzing an asymmetric V-die bending process. This study yielded 
the following findings. 
1. The effect of process parameters on position deviation e is varied and complex. Generally, a small W, 
large Rd and small Rp effectively reduce bending deviation. Moreover, Rd produces more deviation-effect 
compared to Rp. However, under certain conditions, some process parameters, such as thickness, 
lubrication and strength, interact in a complex way that effectively suppresses deviation. Additionally, the 
effect of thickness apparently counteracts the effect of strength on deviation under certain conditions, and 
this interaction is complicated. Therefore, thickness apparently has an important role in deviation 
formation. Further work is inevitably needed.   
2. The effects of process parameters such as sheet thickness, contact friction, material strength and die 
opening, on springback angle are variable. Therefore, this study indicates that the interaction of process 
parameters is very complicated and irregular. The process parameters cannot be considered in isolation. 
3. Finite element simulation results agree well with the experimental results in analyses of the region 
between μ = 0.1 and μ = 0.15 in this work. Therefore, friction coefficient plays an important role in 
calculation because determining its precise value is a complicated problem when performing a simulation. 
The FE simulations show the region of plastic deformation, which indicates the overall process of 
deformation. They also show material flow through incremental changes in distribution of displacement, 
which indicates position deviation based on movement of the bending point. Accordingly, a springback 
phenomenon can be simulated to show the final shape of component as all tools are removed for elastic 
unloading. 
Using FE simulation to observe deviation processes is useful for designing an asymmetric bent component 
without bending deviation.
