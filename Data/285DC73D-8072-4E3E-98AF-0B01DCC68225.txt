Abstract. With modern lithographic technology, a compact spectrom-
eter is designed to include a blazed micro-grating with cylindrical con-
cave grating profile. In order to restrict the sagittal beam divergence and
to reduce the size of the spectrometer, the micro-grating is embedded
inside a pair of planar mirrors used as a slab waveguide. In the simula-
tions for the effect of the waveguide, we discover that the focal pattern
distortion introduced by the waveguide causes a blunted and side-tailed
peak in the spectrum. The distortion can be managed by allowing some
gap between the edge of the waveguide and the image sensor. Such a
configuration has greatly improved the resolving power of the micro-
grating in this compact system. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

1 Introduction
In the design of microspectrometer chips, a blazed grating
is usually chosen, due to its higher efficiency at the selected
diffraction order.1 In addition, a blazed grating can be made
on a concave surface to converge the diffracted beam. Such
a design can get rid of the lens system for focusing and
reduce the complexity when it is implemented in a spec-
trometer chip. Specifically, the concave reflective grating
uses the Rowland circle spectrometer configuration,2 where
the diffraction beams of different wavelengths are focused
onto different locations on the Rowland circle circumfer-
ence, as shown in Fig. 1.
The divergent half angle of the incident beam from the
fiber to the grating is typically 12 deg. Because the cylin-
drical concave grating in a Rowland circle configuration
can only focus the diffracted beam in the meridional direc-
tion, the diffracted beam remains divergent in the sagittal
plane, as depicted in Fig. 2. To collect as much diffracted
light on the sensor as possible, the micro-grating is placed
between a pair of planar mirrors as a slab waveguide,
which restricts the diffracted light within a finite range on
the sagittal plane, as shown in Fig. 2.
The design, the making, and the spectroscopic measure-
ment of the micro-grating system are described
elsewhere.3,4 Either the x-ray LIGA or the induced-
coupled-plasma reactive ion etcher ICP-RIE with a step-
per from I line 365 nm or G line 436 nm can be used to
fabricate the grating, according to our previous work with
deep x-ray lithography DXL.3 The fabrication procedures

waveguide. The simulated result is consistent with the
spectrum observed in the SWMG system in Ref. 3, where a
subsignal at the proximal wavelength beside the main
wavelength is detected as a side tail. We can now attribute
it to the distortion caused by the slab waveguide. This co-
matic distortion degrades the spectral resolution of the
SWMG spectral measurement system.3
In order to solve this problem of degradation in spectral
measurement introduced by the slab waveguide, we figure
out a systematic approach to restore the comatic distortion
of the spectrum to a normal Gaussian-shaped spectrum of
a single wavelength input. In this approach, two param-
eters are adjusted: 1 the gap G see Fig. 2 and 2 the
pixel height h the vertical size of the pixel of the linear
image sensor used to acquire the spectrum.
On adjusting the gap G between the waveguide edge and
the detector plane, the distortion becomes quite different.
The existence of this gap allows the beam to exit the wave-
guide with a divergence in the sagittal direction onto the
detector plane. Consequently, the wider gap yields an im-
age that is more divergent in the y direction, as shown in
Fig. 3 The simulated diffraction intensity m=−3 distribution on the detector region at the focal plane
Gaussian image plane. There is no gap G=0 mm between the waveguide edge and the detector.

though a gapless configuration retains most of the photon
energy on the detector, it is not a practical configuration,
because a typical linear image sensor used as a spectrum
detector always has a cover glass for protection, which
introduces certain gap G0 mm between the waveguide
edge and the photon sensing surface on the sensor.
4 Mechanism of Spectral Resolution Recovery
4.1 Step I: x-- Transformation
In the setup of a spectrometer, the incident beam of differ-
ent wavelengths is dispersed along the x axis in the Gauss-
ian image plane and forms a spectrum see Fig. 1. Usually,
a linear image sensor is positioned at the Gaussian image
plane to detect such a spectrum. The conversion of the x
position on the linear image sensor to the wavelength  is
carried out by using the grating equation 1 with the fol-
lowing procedure: The diffracted beam at position x on the
Gaussian image plane is converted to its corresponding dif-
fraction angle , which is related to a wavelength value 
by Eq. 1. The x coordinate on the detector is thus con-
verted to the  coordinate. Using this x-- transformation,
the spatial distribution of the impinging beam on the linear
image sensor along the x direction photon intensity versus
position x is converted to a spectrum photon intensity
versus wavelength .
4.2 Step II: G-h Adjustment
The vertical pixel size, which is denoted as h in Fig. 4, has
three values—50, 200, and 500 m—chosen for three
commercially available linear image sensors to demonstrate
the process of spectral resolution recovery. To collect more
light signal on the linear image sensor, a larger vertical
pixel size is used. However, the larger pixel includes more
portions of the crescent-shaped distortion image see Fig.
4 and results in an incorrect wavelength reading, as illus-
trated in Figs. 6–8. Here the integrated intensity within the
vertical pixel size range i.e., within the range of the two
dashed lines in Fig. 4 on the linear image sensor is plotted
as a function of the wavelength readout via the x--
transformation described in Sec. 4.1 for various gap widths
of G and vertical pixel sizes h, with the sagittal incident
divergent half angle at  /2=12 deg, which is the typical
divergent angle of the beam exiting from an optical fiber.
5 Discussion
The gapless configuration always gains the highest shoul-
der side tail on the long-wavelength side of the peak for
all three integration ranges h, because the comatic spread
observed in Fig. 3b is always within the integration range.
On the other hand, the existence of the gap reduces the
side-tail spread, because the vertical integration range h
only captures the central portions in the vertical direction
of the crescent-shaped image the region between the two
dashed lines in Fig. 4. The peak intensities and the full
width at half maximum FWHM spectral widths i.e., the
spectral resolution  of the spectral curves are listed in
Tables 1 and 2.
In order to improve the spectral resolution  i.e., to
reduce the FWHM spectral width, a wider gap G should be
