Abstract 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of organobromines compounds to widely exist in the 
environment and further to threat human health. Although European or North American countries have began to 
ban the use of PBDEs, the restriction of PBDEs use is still occurred in Taiwan. This research is a 3-year NSC 
project to carry out health issue for mothers and their offspring with PBDE exposures. The study design of the 
present project was as follows. Pregnant women were invited to join our study during routine prenatal health 
check-ups in an obstetrics clinic. Participants answered the detailed questionnaires. Cord blood was gathered 
from umbilical cord vein in labor. Breast milk was collected at participants‘ home within one month after 
delivery. Neurodevelopment of our participants‘ offspring was evaluated when they were 8 months old. Thyroid 
hormones, including Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), Thyroid simulating hormone (TSH), Free T3 (FT3), 
and Free T4, in cord blood were determined using an automated chemiluminescence analyzer. PBDEs (BDE-7, 
15, 17, 28, 47, 49, 66, 77, 85, 99, 100, 119, 126, 138, 139, 140, 153, 154, 156, 183, 184, 191, 196, 197, 203, 
206, 207, 208, 209) in cord blood or breast milk were analyzed by a high resolution gas chromatography with a 
high resolution mass spectrometer. Infant neurodevelopment was examined using Bayley Score Infants and 
Toddlers Development, third edition (Bayley-III). 
We collected 140 participants‘ breast-milk samples and 54 cord blood samples between April 2007 and 
December 2009 in four local hospitals from southern Taiwan. Levels of Σ30PBDEs in breast milk and cord 
blood were 5.46 (median (Md)=3.51) and 32.2 (Md=28.8) ng/g lipid, respectively. In comparison to European 
and East Asian, our Σ30PBDE values in breast milk and cord blood were not apparently high. Our values were 
20 times lower than those in America. According to our findings of the present study, we found that increased 
PBDE levels of breast milk were statistically linked to mothers with order age, lower pregnant body mass index 
(BMI), lower education level, occupational exposure, a prolonged menstruation period, and irregular menstrual 
cycle and lower birth outcomes of their offspring. Cord blood PBDEs was negatively correlated with T3 and 
FT3, respectively, but positively associated with maternal age. Future works will be further tested associations 
between PBDE exposures and infant neurodevelopment. 
PBDEs are widespread in the environment, with sources including manufacturing, waste disposal 
processes, and the inevitable release from products (Covaci et al., 2003; Hites, 2004). The residues of 
PBDEs have been found in home dust (Wu et al., 2007; Allen et al., 2008), fish (Ohta et al., 2002; Schecter 
et al., 2006), vegetables (Ohta et al., 2002), aquatic mammals (de Boer et al., 1998), domestic mammals 
(Dye et al., 2007), and humans (Noren and Meironyte, 2000; Bi et al., 2006; Schecter et al., 2007). Several 
reports have found PBDEs in soil, fly ash, fish, and breast milk in Taiwan (Peng et al., 2007; Chao et al., 
2007; Wang et al., 2008). In our previous report (Chao et al., 2007), PBDE concentrations in breast milk and 
the PBDE daily intake of a breastfed infant in Taiwan were comparable to those reported from other 
countries, except for the United States and Canada. 
This report investigates the levels of PBDEs in breast milk from mothers in southern Taiwan between 
2007 and 2008. It also discusses whether PBDE levels are associated with women‘s age, pre-pregnant BMI 
or other demographic parameters. Temporal changes of PBDEs in breast milk of Taiwanese mothers may 
have occurred between 2000 and 2008, despite the continuously decreased importation of PBDEs during this 
period. 
Material and Methods 
Recruitment of study participants 
This study is one part of the ongoing survey program that measures the exposure to PBDEs of mothers 
and their nursing infants. Our participants were healthy non-occupationally exposed pregnant women 
recruited from two local hospitals in the Pingtung area in southern Taiwan from April 2007 to February 2008. 
Participants were invited and interviewed by a well-trained research nurse at various obstetric clinics during 
routine health check-ups. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) of the Human Ethical Committee at Pingtung Christian Hospital, Taiwan, in 2007. Ethical standards 
formulated from the Helsinki Declarations of 1964, and revised in 2000, were followed. All participants gave 
informed consent after receiving detailed explanations of the study and potential consequences prior to 
enrollments.  
More than 200 pregnant women were invited, with 117 participants agreeing to join this program. The 
study participants were selected mainly based on compliance with the following criteria: minimum residence 
time of 3 years in southern Taiwan, ability to supply sufficient breast milk samples (>120 ml), and eagerness 
to strictly obey our protocol to prevent contamination prior to chemical analyses. Seventy four participants 
were enrolled based on healthy outcomes and voluntary donations of two specimens (cord blood and breast 
milk). We collected 56 breast milk samples until February, 2008. Thirty two milk samples were randomly 
selected from the 56 samples for further chemical and statistical analysis. No significant differences in values 
of age and pre-pregnant BMI between 32 mothers with milk PBDEs levels and 24 mothers without PBDE 
levels. 
The measurements of participants‘ demographic parameters included height, pre-pregnant weight, and 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The questionnaire included details on age, occupational and 
non-occupational exposure to PBDEs, reproductive history, socioeconomic status (e.g. annual household 
income, education level, and religion), smoking and dietary habits (e.g. the frequency and amount of 
consumption of fish, shellfish, meat, and vegetables), alcohol consumption, and medical and pregnancy 
history.  
Sample collection 
The procedure for collecting breast milk has been previously described in Chao et al., 2004. In brief, 
breast milk was collected in the period between the second and fourth week after delivery. Women collected 
lower pre-pregnant BMI group and higher pre-pregnant BMI group) were compared, Mann-Whitney U tests 
were used. Jonckheere-Terpstra and Kruskal Willis H tests were used for comparisons among the parity and 
ethnic groups, respectively. Analyses were carried out using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) 
version 12.0. 
Results 
Descriptive statistics of our participants are shown in Table 1. Medians of the women‘s ages, 
pre-pregnant BMIs, and lipid content were 30.5 years, 21.0 kg/m
2
, and 3.55%, respectively. Primipara and 
secondipara mothers made up 37.5 and 40.6%, respectively, of the total participants. Most participants were 
Southern Min (19/32), with 4 Hakkanese, and 5 Aborigine completing the sample. The ethnic groups of 
Southern Min, Hakkanese, and Mainland Chinese, indicate these peoples migrated from Mainland China. 
Genetic similarities between aboriginal Taiwanese and Oceanic peoples and Southeast Asians are closer in 
comparison than to those between aboriginal Taiwanese and Taiwanese who migrated from China (Trejaut et 
al., 2005). 
The mean and median of ΣPBDEs in breast milk were 3.54 and 3.31 ng/g lipid, respectively, with a 
standard deviation (SD) of 3.11 ng/g lipid (Table 2). If the concentration is presented as a mean value, the 
predominant congeners were BDE-47 (0.581 ng/g lipid), BDE-153 (0.955 ng/g lipid), and BDE-209 (0.483 
ng/g lipid), accounting approximately for 60% of the ΣPBDEs. Most of the results for BDE-7, BDE-17, 
BDE-71, BDE-77, BDE-119, BDE-126, BDE-156, BDE-184, and BDE-191 were below the LODs. BDE-15, 
BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, BDE-197, BDE-203, and BDE-207 were 
detectable in all 32 samples. 
In Table 3, good correlation coefficients (p<0.05) were found between tetraBDEs and decaBDE. The 
best coefficient (r=0.900, p<0.001) was between tetraBDEs and pentaBDEs. NonaBDEs were the best 
predictors (r=0.372~0.834, p<0.001~p=0.030) for the other PBDE homologues, except for the association of 
nonaBDEs and diBDEs (r=0.077, p=0.677). ΣPBDEs could be predicted by PBDE congeners from triBDEs 
to decaBDE, (r=0.537~0.834, p<0.001), except for the diBDEs (r=0.278, p=0.123). 
No significant correlations were observed between levels of PBDEs including Σ PBDEs in breast milk, 
maternal age , and pre-pregnant BMI using Pearson correlation tests. Older age was significantly correlated 
with increased hexaBDE levels (r=0.416, p=0.018), but pre-pregnant BMI was negatively associated with 
levels of nonaBDEs (r=-0.390, p=0.027) and decaBDE (r=-0.374, p=0.035), respectively, when we 
employed Spearman‘s rho correlation coefficient method (data not shown). No significant differences in 
ΣPBDEs were found among age, pre-pregnant BMI, parity, and ethnic groups, as shown in Table 4. We 
found that levels of triBDEs (p=0.040) and hexaBDEs (p=0.016) were significantly correlated with the older 
age (>29 yr). Although nonaBDEs and decaBDE showed statistically significant results for pre-pregnant 
BMI, women with BMI≤21 kg/m2 did not have significantly higher concentrations of nonaBDEs, decaBDE, 
and ΣPBDEs compared to those with BMI>21 kg/m2. We also offered the levels of PBDEs in 20 breast milk 
samples (12 individual PBDEs: BDE-17, 28, 47, 66, 85, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183, and 209) from our 
previous report (Chao et al., 2007), of which the sampling time and sampling area was 2000-2001 and 
central Taiwan, respectively. A higher mean of ΣPBDE concentration (3.92 ng/g lipid) was found in our 
previous study between 2000 and 2001 as compared to that (3.64 ng/g lipid, p=0.039) in the present study by 
a nonparametric Mann-Whiney U test. Concentrations of ΣPBDEs are only 7% lower in the present study 
than in the previous study. This difference might also be due to the different cohorts; however, geometric 
mean concentrations of BDE-17 (Taichung/Pingtung (T/P): 0.0050/0.0065 ng/g lipid, p=0.002), BDE-183 
(T/P: 0.063/0.123, p=0.012), and BDE-209 (T/P: 0.159/0.428, p<0.001) in 2000 and 2001 were significantly 
2007), levels of ΣPBDEs in breast milk were significantly lower in 2007-2008 (Figure 1), probably due to 
the decreasing amount of PBDEs released into the environment and the decrease in the environmental 
loading of PBDEs. The congeners of BDE-183 and 209 in the present study (2007-2008) were significantly 
greater that those in our previous study (2000-2001). Levels of PBDEs in breast milk increased in the two 
decades before PBDEs were restricted or banned (Costa and Giordano, 2007). Time trend studies pointed out 
that PBDE levels in serum seemed to have stabilized from 1999 to 2003 (Thomen et al., 2007) and that 
PBDE levels in breast milk appeared to have decreased between 1999 and 2001 (Lind et al., 2003). There is 
no convincing evidence that PBDE levels have stabilized in America, but this is true in Europe. A study from 
northern Russia (Polder et al., 2008) has indicated that ΣPBDEs without BDE-209 was slightly lower in 
breast milk collected in 2000 compared to 2002, but ΣPBDEs with BDE-209 was slightly higher in breast 
milk investigated in 2002. No data shows the decline of PBDEs in breast milk after the use of pentaBDEs 
and octaBDEs was banned. Although a Russian study showed these findings (Polder et al., 2008), we could 
not conclude the decline of PBDEs in Taiwanese breast milk during the short-term duration based on our 
results in Figure 1. A longitudinal time-trend study is needed in Taiwan. In addition, we also found that there 
is a dramatic shift in the congener pattern (Figure 1). 
No significant differences in PBDE homologue levels were found among the parity and ethnic groups 
(Table 4). In a previous study (Herbstman et al., 2007), no significant differences in BDE-47, BDE-100, and 
BDE-153 from cord blood samples between primiparous and multiparous mothers were found after the 
confounders of maternal age, weight gain during pregnancy, education, and BMI were controlled. According 
to our previous studies (Chao et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008), PBDE levels were not significantly different 
between primiparous and multiparous mothers. Similarly, our result also showed no significant differences in 
levels of PBDEs and ΣPBDEs between two groups of parity. Herbstman and her researchers revealed that 
Asians generally had lower PBDE levels in cord blood compared to Caucasians (Herbstman et al., 2007) 
when they lived in Baltimore, but our data indicated that PBDEs exposure was not associated with 
Taiwanese ethnic groups in southern Taiwan. It is probably due to the similar exposure routes and pathways 
in Taiwanese ethnic groups. 
Although ΣPBDE levels in breast milk were not significantly correlated with women‘s age, levels of 
triBDEs (p=0.040) and hexaBDEs (p=0.016) significantly increased with women‘s age. It was worthy of 
note that triBDEs might be rapidly eliminated. Few reports have shown that levels of certain PBDE 
congeners in breast milk increase with maternal age. A Japanese report showed that age-dependency was 
only observed for BDE-153 in 20 breast-milk samples (Haraguchi et al., 2009). There is a great deal of 
uncertainty due to the small number of mothers. Our statistical results that showed positive associations 
between women‘s ages and levels of triBDEs and hexaBDEs in breast milk is probably due to the reduction 
of commercial PBDEs use during the period from 2000 to 2007 in Taiwan, and PBDEs lipophilic 
bioaccumulation based on the past exposure. The age range from 20 to 41 for our participants is relatively 
narrow and our sampling size is small. If we infer that levels of triBDEs and hexaBDEs are positively 
dependent on age, this inference is so far speculative; therefore, a larger sampling size and the wider age 
range are needed. Currently, an American study was preformed where increased ΣPBDEs was correlated 
with lower maternal age (Herbstman et al., 2007). Most studies have shown no associations between the 
body burden of PBDEs and maternal age (Thomsen et al., 2002; Schecter et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007; Wang 
et al., 2008). Covaci et al. (2008) indicated that levels of PBDEs in human tissues were not associated with 
age, but rather probably due to recent exposure and that a steady-state has not been reached in human tissues. 
Women‘s pre-pregnant BMI was not significantly associated with decreased ΣPBDE levels in breast

epidemiological studies have been conducted on the association of PBDEs exposure with 
health; therefore, the harmful effects of PBDEs on human health are still unknown [13]. 
Fish, meat, and dairy consumption as well as dust ingestion may be the major routes 
of exposure to PBDEs, with air inhalation usually playing a small additional role [10, 
13-16,]. Owing to high lipid contents of breast milk, PBDE congeners of breast milk are 
easily detected by current analytical technologies. Breast milk is also a non-invasive 
specimen convenient for continuous biomonitoring of PBDEs in the general population. It 
is possible that a breastfed infant is postnatally exposed to PBDEs via breastfeeding. An 
assessment study indicated that infant consumption of PBDEs from breast milk was the 
largest contributor to lifetime exposure [17]. However, several reports indicate the 
opposite. For example, Fangström and co-workers concluded that PBDEs in children were 
most probably derived from environmental sources rather than maternal transfer [18]. A 
recent study of family members with non-occupational exposure to PBDEs suggested that 
toddlers and children had a higher risk of PBDEs exposure and faced higher risks of 
PBDE-related health effects than their parents [19].  
The use of most PBDEs, like pentaBDEs and octaBDEs, has been banned in Europe 
and voluntarily withdrawn from developing countries, including Taiwan. Temporal trends 
or changes of PBDEs in breast milk were evaluated in a few studies after the ban or 
restriction of PBDEs use [20-23], but no reports were evaluated in Taiwan. PBDEs 
environmental monitoring and biomonitoring data are limited in Taiwan. In our previous 
study [12], levels of ΣPBDEs in breast milk collected between 2000 and 2001 in central 
Taiwan were comparable to levels in breast milk collected during the same period in 
Europe or East-Asian countries, but 10-20 times lower than that measured in the United 
States. We also found that the ratios of PCB153/BDE-47, PCB153/BDE-153, and 
PCB153/ΣPBDEs were significantly correlated with frequent consumption of fish and 
shellfish, but not of meat or other foodstuffs [24]. In the present study, we determine the 
current levels of PBDEs in Taiwanese breast milk to calculate differences in PBDEs 
between the present survey and the past data investigated from 2000 to 2001. It is 
examined whether PBDEs in breast milk are associated with demographic characteristics 
(e.g. age), socioeconomic status (e.g. education level), and lifestyle factors (e.g. 
occupational exposure). The main influences of PBDEs exposure among the factors of 
demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle were also determined in 
the present study. 
Material and Methods 
Recruitment of study participants 
Breast milk was collected from women who delivered at local hospitals in southern 
Taiwan between 5 April 2007 and 30 April 2008. We obtained approval from the 
Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in four local hospitals and the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) of the Human Research Ethics Committee at Pingtung Christian 
Hospital, Taiwan, in 2007. All participants gave informed consent after receiving detailed 
explanations of the study and potential consequences prior to enrollment. 
Our participants were healthy pregnant women recruited from four local hospitals in 
congeners of BDE-15, 28, 47, and 99 (100 ng/mL), and 153, 154, 183, and 197 (200 
ng/mL), and 207 and 209 (500 ng/mL) were added into breast-milk samples before the 
extraction. A mixture of 45 mL of acetone and 15 mL of milk sample was extracted with 
15 mL of n-hexane, sonicated for 20 minutes, and centrifuged for 15 minutes (2000 rpm, 
20C). This step was repeated at least three times. The extract was pooled and then washed 
with distilled water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The lipid content of the 
breast milk was determined gravimetrically.  
The extract was cleaned up as follows. The first cleanup involved treatment with 
concentrated sulfuric acid. The next cleanup procedure involved a multi-layered silica 
column packed sequentially with a plug of glass wool, 0.3 mL of activated silica gel, 0.5 
mL of silver nitrate (AgNO3) silica gel (10%, w/w), 0.3 mL of activated silica gel, 0.5 mL 
of basic silica gel, 0.3 mL of activated silica gel, 6.2 mL of acid silica gel, and 2.0 mL of 
anhydrous granular sodium sulfate. The sample extract, dissolved in 5 mL of n-hexane, 
was added to the multi-layered silica column with two additional 5-mL rinses. The 
absorbed material on the column was eluted with 30 mL of dichloromethane/hexane 
(10/90, v/v) and the entire eluate was collected, concentrated to a volume of about 1 mL 
using a rotary evaporator, transferred to the top of an acid alumina column, and eluted 
with 15 mL of hexane followed by 20 mL dichloromethane/hexane (4/96, v/v). The eluate 
was discarded and the adsorbed material on the column was eluted again with 30 mL 
dichloromethane/hexane (40/60, v/v), collected, concentrated to near dryness by using a 
nitrogen stream, and then transferred to a vial. 50μl of 13C-labeled BDE-139 was added in 
a vial containing the eluate as an internal standard after the clean-up prior to injection. The 
final extract was reduced in volume to 1 mL under a stream of nitrogen. 
The 30 PBDEs were assayed using a high resolution gas chromatograph 
(Hewlett-Packard 6970, Palo Alto, United States) and a high resolution mass spectrometer 
(Micromass Autospec Ultima, Manchester, UK) with a DB-5HT column (L= 15 m, i.d.= 
0.25 mm, film thickness = 0.1 μm) (J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) with splitless injection. 
The two most abundant isotope masses were measured for each congener. Quantification 
was performed using internal/external standard mixtures via the isotope dilution method.  
Solvents and reagents were tested before each procedure. All glassware was washed 
with HPLC ultra-grade hexane or acetone (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) before use. The 
blank tests of solvents and glassware were regularly checked. Recovery measured for 10 
13
C12-labeled PBDE internal standards was added in breast milk before the extraction to 
ensure recovery in the whole process of chemical analysis. The recovery rates were 
calculated to be between 70 and 130%. The limits of detection (LODs) of 29 PBDEs were 
0.8–16 pg/ g lipid. For BDE-209, the LOD was 110 pg/ g lipid. For quality control, a 
laboratory blank and a QC pooled breast milk sample were included in each batch of 
approximately 10 samples. The result of a Shewhart control chart for QC pooled breast 
milk samples fully obeyed the control limit of mean ± 3SD and the warning limits of mean 
± 2SD, respectively.  
Statistical analysis 
Analytical measurements lower than the LODs were set to half of the LODs for 
significantly lower in non-native born women than in native-born ones before or after age 
and pre-pregnancy BMI is controlled.  
In Table 5, ΣPBDE levels are not differed in the binary groups of smoking habits, 
passive smokers, computer use, and occupational exposure. Levels of heptaBDEs and 
octaBDEs are significantly higher in women with occupational exposure than in the other 
women after controlling for age and pre-pregnancy BMI. No significant differences in 
concentrations of diBDEs to decaBDE are found between the binary groups of smoking 
habits, passive smoking, and computer use. 
The binary variables from Table 4 and 5 are used to predict levels of ΣPBDEs and 
PBDEs from diBDEs to decaBDE in Table 6. Log ΣPBDEs in breast milk are significantly 
predicted by the binary variables of age and education level using a multiple stepwise 
linear regression, but this relationship only explains 23.9% of the total variances. Log 
nonaBDEs and log triBDEs could be slightly explained by two binary variables (age and 
education level). Log octaBDEs and log hexaBDEs are slightly correlated with three 
binary variables including age, education level, and occupational exposure. Log 
hexaBDEs and log tetraBDEs have significant associations with one binary variable (age) 
and three binary variables (age, ethnicity, and education level), respectively. Log decaBDE 
and log diBDEs are not significantly related to the binary variables described in Table 4 
and 5. 
Discussion 
In our present study, a mean level of BDE-153 has the highest concentration among 
30 PBDE congeners. The dominant PBDE congener was BDE-47 in most studies [12, 36, 
37] and BDE-153 in some others [28, 30, 38]. The notable variation of PBDE levels in 
breast milk from different countries or regions is shown in Table 3. The differences in 
PBDE distribution are probably due to differences in dietary habits and PBDE 
contamination in the environment. PBDE concentrations in breast milk from northern 
China [33] were found to differ significantly from those in central China [32] and southern 
Taiwan [12]. A probable cause is that the dietary habits and levels of industrialization are 
different in these three geographic regions. The current sum of 12 PBDE congeners in 
breast milk (BDE-17, -28, -47, -66, -85, -99, -100, -138, -153, -154, -183, and -209), 
whose mean is 2.75 ng/g lipid, is lower than the previous value (3.93 ng/g lipid) in breast 
milk collected in 2000-2001 [24]. Our value in the current study is 0.7-fold lower than the 
past value in our previous report conducted in 2000-2002. 
Few reports show that increased ΣPBDEs in breast milk are significantly associated 
with increased age. In our report, higher age is correlated with higher levels of ΣPBDEs 
(p=0.021) (Table 4). A positive age-dependency for ΣPBDEs in the present study is shown 
for an exploratory relationship and the occurrence of this relation is still unknown. The 
mother‘s age was not significantly related to ΣPBDEs in human specimens from most 
previous studies [11, 12, 24, 36, 39-42]. In several studies, the absence of the 
age-dependency of ΣPBDEs was probably due to recent exposure; notably, steady-state 
concentrations are never achieved in human tissues, and accumulation in the environment 
is over a short time span [39, 43]. In a recent breast-milk study from Japan [23], 
Swedish studies [44, 45], serum levels of hexaBDEs to nonaBDEs and ΣPBDEs were 
higher in workers within the electronic-dismantling industry than in control workers 
without occupational exposure. Sjödin et al. (1999) [45] also indicated that serum levels of 
BDE-153, -154, and -183 were significantly higher in computer operators than in hospital 
cleaners. A report from Korea showed similar PBDE levels and congener profiles in 
incinerator workers and the general population [41]. A Japanese study showing the 
difference in age-dependency for BDE-153 between Kyoto and Sendai was probably 
influenced by their occupation (85% housewives in Kyoto and 85% workers in Sendai) 
[23]. Probably due to small sampling size, the present study only shows an exploratory 
relationship between occupational exposure and certain PBDEs.  
Table 6 shows the significant predictors of ΣPBDEs and certain PBDEs using the 
binary variables. The main factors that influenced ΣPBDEs and certain PBDEs in breast 
milk are age and education levels in this population. Occupational exposure is also related 
to women exposed to heptaBDEs and octaBDEs, while these organobromine compounds 
are associated with the binary variables of age and education level. The existence of higher 
ΣPBDE levels in relation to lower education level and order maternal age in the present 
study is thoroughly considered because small sample size limits the statistical power of 
our observations. Although our study‘s primary concern was young mothers and their 
offspring, PBDEs exposure impacts all human health, particularly aberrations in hormone 
secretion and neurobehavioural development. Larger studies on the associations between 
the PBDEs exposure and demographic parameters, socioeconomic status, neurotoxicity, 
and hormone secretions should be conducted in the future. 
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as polychlorinated-p-dioxins 
and furans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides 
(OCs), PBDEs are not restricted or banned for use in most countries. Most studies had 
found that higher levels of PCDD/Fs, PCBs, and OCs were strongly correlated with 
increased maternal age and primiparity, but only weakly correlated with decreased 
maternal BMI and education level [11, 46-49]. The difference in associations between 
PBDEs and chlorinated POPs may reflect different exposure pathways, toxico-kinetics, or 
the effects of restrictions and bans, and differences in bioavailability, bioaccumulation, 
biotransformation, and half-lives in biota. Future studies conducted to the associations 
between PBDEs exposure and influenced factors are needed.

 III. Impact of non-occupational exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers on 
menstruation characteristics of reproductive-age females 
Abstract 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) have documented effects on thyroid functions and rodent 
behavior in vivo. Epidemiological studies, however, have revealed only limited information about 
associations between PBDE exposure and menstruation characteristics. Our goal was to examine whether 
high breast-milk PBDE levels in reproductive-age females lead to interference with menstruation 
characteristics. We analyzed 15 PBDE congeners in 46 breast milk samples. Fifteen PBDE congeners 
(BDE-15, 28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 196, 197, 203, 207, 208, and 209) were analyzed using a gas 
chromatograph equipped with a high-resolution mass spectrometer. The mean sum of PBDEs (ΣPBDEs) in 
breast milk was 3.42 ng/g lipid. Women‘s age at menarche was not correlated with breast-milk PBDE 
levels. Increased BDE-208 and 209 levels were significantly associated with the prolonged length of 
average and the longest menstrual cycle independent of age, pre-pregnant BMI, and parity. Higher 
concentrations of ΣPBDEs and the higher brominated PBDEs from BDE-183 to 209, except 197, were 
significantly linked to women whose menstruation periods were still coming irregularly at the sampling 
time. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of BDE-153, 183, 207, 208, and ΣPBDEs were significantly higher in 
women with length of average menstrual cycle > 32 days, compared to the control. Women whose 
menstruation periods still came irregularly when they were 18 years old had higher age-adjusted ORs of 
BDE-207, 208, 209, and ΣPBDEs than those whose periods came regularly at the same age. Although 
ΣPBDEs and certain higher brominated PBDEs appear to have potential to prolong length of average 
menstrual cycle and delay the age when menstruation periods begin coming regularly, these findings are 
not conclusive because our sample size is small and more scientific evidence is needed. 
Introduction 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) — including pentaBDE, octaBDE, and decaBDE — are the 
brominated flame retardants (BFRs) used in electronic circuit boards and cases, cables, textiles, vehicles, 
synthetic building materials, and carpet lines. PBDEs, mixed into polymers as flame-retardant additives, 
are easily leached from BFR products and then released into the environment. PBDEs, structurally similar 
to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exhibit characteristics similar to those of PCBs, such as persistence 
and bioaccumulation (Darnerud et al., 2001). PBDEs are widespread in the environment and easily 
accumulated in biota (Darnerud et al., 2001); and they have been recognized as both lipophilic endocrine 
disruptors (Darnerud, 2009; Mercado-Feliciano and Bigsby, 2008) and as persistent organic pollutants (de 
Wit, 2002). PBDEs have been found in household dust (Schecter et al., 2005a; Wu et al., 2007; Stapleton et 
al., 2009), meat (Huwe and Larsen, 2005), foodstuffs in the supermarkets (Ohta et al., 2002; Bocio et al., 
2003; Schecter et al., 2006; Martí-Cid et al., 2008; Schecter et al., 2009), fish (Zhu and Hites, 2004; Hites 
et al., 2004), aquatic animals (Hermanussen et al., 2008), and human specimens, including breast milk, 
cord blood, and serum (Norén and Meironyté, 2000; Schecter et al., 2003; Mazdai et al., 2003; Sjodin et al., 
2004; Schecter et al., 2005b). Although the manufacture and use of PBDEs has been banned in the 
European Union since 2003, PBDEs are still imported into Taiwan. 
The endocrine-disrupting potential of several PBDE congeners has been demonstrated mostly in their 
adverse health effects on the functions of thyroid hormones (Julander et al., 2005). PBDEs may be able to 
interfere with thyroid homeostasis (Darnerud et al., 2007). Some predominant BDE congeners, i.e., 
 on healthy outcome and voluntary donation of two specimens (cord blood and breast milk). Of the 98 
participants, 35 women who did not offer breast milk were excluded. Until April 2008, 63 milk samples 
were obtained. Finally, 46 breast milk samples were randomly selected from the 63 milk samples for 
further chemical analysis. 
Breast-milk samples (120–360 ml) were collected in 3 n-hexane-washed glass-bottles and frozen at 
home (−4 °C) within one month after delivery. Participants telephoned us after they finished breast-milk 
collection. Our researchers went to the women‘s homes and immediately delivered milk samples to our 
laboratory in the Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, National Pingtung University of 
Science and Technology, where the samples were stored at −20 °C. Milk samples of 25 ml each were 
packaged in chemically clean containers and transported to the Supermicro Mass Research and Technology 
Center at Cheng Shiu University in southern Taiwan for chemical analysis. 
Chemical analysis 
Chemical analysis for PBDEs in breast milk has been described in our previous reports (Koh et al., 
2010; Chao et al., 2010). Fifteen PBDE standards (BDE-15, 28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 196, 197, 
203, 207, 208, and 209) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA, USA). 
13
C-labeled standard of 15 PBDEs was sourced from Wellington Laboratories (Guelph, Canada). The 
highest-quality sodium sulfate, alumina oxide, potassium oxalate, and silica gel were obtained from Merck 
(Darmstadt, Germany). 
Fifteen ml milk samples were extracted by sonication for 20 minutes with 15 ml of hexane after the 
addition of 45 ml of acetone; then the mixture was centrifuged. These steps were repeated three times. The 
extract was pooled and evaporated to dryness with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The milk lipid content was 
determined using a gravimetric method. 
13
C-labeled internal standards were spiked in 15 ml of breast milk 
before the extraction and the cleanup procedure for the following PBDEs analyses. The extract was cleaned 
up using a multi-layered silica column with a plug of glass wool, an activated silica gel, a silver nitrate 
silica gel (10%, w/w), and anhydrous granular sodium sulfate; the extract was then passed through an 
alumina oxide column. 50μl of 13C-labeled BDE-139 was added as a recovery standard after the cleanup 
and prior to injection. The final extract was concentrated in volume under a stream of nitrogen. 
Measurements of 15 PBDEs were performed using a high resolution gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 
6970) and a high resolution mass spectrometer (Micromass Autospec Ultima). Separation was performed 
by splitless injection onto a DB-5HT column (Koh et al., 2010; Chao et al., 2010). The two most abundant 
isotope masses were measured for each component. 
Solvents and reagents were tested before each procedure. All glassware was washed with HPLC 
ultra-grade hexane or acetone (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) before use. The blank tests of solvents and 
glassware were regularly checked. Recovery measured for 10 
13
C12-labeled PBDE internal standards was 
added in breast milk before the extraction to ensure recovery in the whole process of chemical analysis to 
be calculated the recovery rates between 70 and 130%. Limits of detection (LODs) were predetermined so 
that the signal to noise ratio for both ions of a specific congener should be above 3. For quality control, a 
laboratory blank and a QC pooled breast milk sample were included in each batch of approximately 10 
samples. The result of a Shewhart control chart for QC pooled breast milk samples fully obeyed the control 
limit of mean ± 3SD and the warning limits of mean ± 2SD, respectively. 
Statistical analysis 
 0.097/0.273 ng/g lipid, p = 0.007), BDE-196 (0.024/0.060 ng/g lipid, p = 0.002), BDE-197 (0.174/0.341 
ng/g lipid, p = 0.026), BDE-207 (0.112/0.248 ng/g lipid, p = 0.005), BDE-208 (0.047/0.091 ng/g lipid, p = 
0.029), BDE-209 (0.338/0.646 ng/g lipid, p = 0.027), and ΣPBDEs (3.04/4.97 ng/g lipid, p = 0.009) were 
significantly correlated with the longer duration of average length of menstrual cycle. Higher levels of 
BDE-100 (≤ 22 days / > 22 days: 0.134/0.187 ng/g lipid, p = 0.025), BDE-154 (0.049/0.082, p = 0.047), 
BDE-183 (0.057/0.134, p = 0.004), and BDE-196 (0.018/0.031, p = 0.042) were significantly associated 
with the prolonged length of the shortest menstrual cycle. We also found that women with the prolonged 
length of the longest menstrual cycle (> 40 days) had significantly higher levels of BDE-99 (0.218 ng/g 
lipid), BDE-208 (0.070 ng/g lipid), and BDE-209 (0.504 ng/g lipid), as compared with those with the 
longest menstrual cycle ≤ 40 days (BDE-99: 0.143 ng/g lipid, p = 0.003; BDE-208: 0.046 ng/g lipid, p = 
0.042; BDE-209: 0.031 ng/g lipid, p = 0.042). There was a significant difference in BDE-153 between 
duration of menstrual bleeding per cycle ≤ 5 days (0.748 ng/g lipid) and > 5 days (1.036 ng/g lipid, p = 
0.040). Women whose periods of menstruation were still irregular at the sampling time had significantly 
higher levels of BDE-47 (p = 0.044), BDE-153 (p = 0.015), BDE-183 (p = 0.011), BDE-196 (p < 0.001), 
BDE-203 (p = 0.042), BDE-207 (p < 0.001), BDE-208 (p < 0.001), BDE-209 (p = 0.007), and ΣPBDEs (p 
< 0.001), as compared with those whose periods came regularly when they were 18 yr. There were no 
significant differences in PBDE concentrations in lower and higher groups of age at menarche. These 
menstruation characteristics described previously did not display significant associations with BDE-15, 28, 
and 49. Moreover, there were no significant differences in levels of certain PBDEs and ΣPBDEs associated 
with two groups of dysmenorrheal, experience with hormone use, experience with obstetric or 
gynecological operation, dietary habit with Chinese medicine, and experience with contraception (data not 
shown). 
Levels of log-transformed PBDEs were significantly associated with the groups of menstruation 
characteristics by testing multiple linear stepwise regressions (Table 4). Log BDE-99 (β = 0.193, p = 0.028), 
BDE-100 (β = 0.249, p = 0.004), and BDE-154 (β = 0.326, p = 0.006) were positively correlated with the 
prolonged length of the longest menstrual cycle after adjusting for age, pre-pregnant BMI, and parity. After 
the confounders were adjusted, higher levels of logBDE-183 and logBDE-197 were significantly 
associated with longer length of average menstrual cycle (BDE-183: β = 0.488, p < 0.001; BDE-197: β = 
0.313, p = 0.009) and length of the shortest menstrual cycle (BDE-183: β = 0.481, p < 0.001; BDE-197: β 
= 0.248, p = 0.026). Higher levels of log BDE-203 (β = 0.149, p = 0.041), 207 (β = 0.221, p < 0.001), 208 
(β = 0.230, p < 0.001), and ΣPBDEs (β = 0.128, p = 0.001) had significantly positive correlations with 
women whose menstruation periods still came irregularly at the sampling time. Higher level of log 
BDE-196 was significantly correlated with women with their periods coming irregularly at the sampling 
time (β = 0.144, p = 0.032) and the prolonged length of the shortest (β = 0.269, p = 0.008) and average (β = 
0.271, p = 0.035) menstrual cycle. Increased log BDE-153 was significantly linked to the prolonged length 
of average menstrual cycle after the controllers were adjusted (β = 0.101, p = 0.048). Log BDE-209 was 
found to be positively correlated only with longer duration of menstrual bleeding cycle (β = 0.247, p = 
0.027). 
Tables 5 and 6 show ORs of PBDE levels in mothers with higher length of menstruation 
characteristics compared to the reference groups, using binary logistic regression models. As shown in 
Table 5, women with duration of menstrual bleeding cycle > 5 days had a slightly but significantly lower 
 in vivo study using DE-71 (PBDEs mixture) revealed that treatments of Wistar rats with DE-71 (60 mg/kg) 
caused no significant change in estrous cycle (Stoker et al., 2004). A new epidemiological study showed 
that increased levels of BDE-47, 99,100, and 153, as well as the sum of these 4 congeners, were correlated 
with the prolonged time to pregnancy, but not associated with menstrual cycle characteristics (Harley et al., 
2010). From our previous study (Chao et al., 2007a), higher levels of BDE-47, 99, 100, and 209 were not 
associated with menstruation characteristics. Although our present result is inconsistent with our previous 
report and Harley‘s study (Chao et al., 2007a; Harley et al., 2010), there is limited information about 
PBDEs‘ effect on characteristics of menstruation or estrous cycle in both in vivo and epidemiological 
studies. Other halogenated persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs) in structural similarity with PBDEs 
might alter menstruation. Our previous placental PCBs survey in the general population indicated that 
elevated dioxin-like and indicator PCBs might prolong the length of the longest menstrual cycle in women 
exposed to them (Chao et al., 2007b). In the same report, higher levels of indicator PCBs were significantly 
associated with women‘s age > 18 yr when menstruation periods began coming regularly (Chao et al., 
2007b). PBDEs, considered as weak estrogen disrupting chemicals, are similar to PCBs in both structure 
and persistence (Mercado-Feliciano and Bigsby, 2008). Although epidemiological evidence in 
PBDEs-induced impacts on reproductive functions remains limited, it is still unknown whether certain 
PBDE congeners are able to affect female reproductive effects. Therefore, a longitudinally epidemiological 
study to evaluate PBDEs‘ effects on female reproductive function is needed. 
There were no statistical differences in PBDE levels between the two age groups of menarche (Table 3). 
Few reports are discussed whether PBDEs exposure might alter women‘s age at menarche or early or 
delayed puberty onset of girls. Many factors — such as heredity, diet, and health condition — have 
potential to affect the age of menarche for women. Several in vivo rodent studies have been conducted to 
determine the association between PBDE exposure and female puberty onset of rats. For example, 
treatments of Wistar rats with DE-71 (60 mg/kg body weight) resulted in a significant delay in the age of 
vaginal opening (Stoker et al., 2004). Moreover, treatments of rats with BDE-99 (10 mg/kg body weight) 
significantly delayed the puberty onset of female offspring (Lilienthal et al., 2006). In contrast to those two 
animal studies, it has also been shown that the day of puberty onset (Long Evens rats) was not significantly 
different between the treated (1 and 10 mg BDE-99/kg/day) and control groups (Ceccatelli et al., 2006). 
The menstrual cycle may be divided into several stages under the control of hormone systems, 
particularly of progesterone and estrogen. Steroid and nonsteroid hormones mediate the effect of ovaries on 
the hypothalamic-pituitary system. Estradiol and progesterone are important regulators of 
follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone secretion (Messinis, 2006). A recent study indicated 
that male testosterone concentrations were positively associated with levels of BDE-47, BDE-99, and 
BDE-153 in serum of male adults with PBDE exposure from fish diet (Turyk et al., 2008). To our 
knowledge, no studies have examined the adverse effects of PBDEs exposure on human estrogen and their 
metabolites. An animal study revealed that treatments of rats with BDE-99 (1 and 10 mg/kg body weight) 
caused no significant change in the levels of serum estradiol in female offspring with postnatal days of 21 
(Lilienthal et al., 2006). On the other hand, decreased levels of serum estradiol and alterations in 
folliculogenesis were significant in the female offspring (Wistar rats) exposed to BDE-47 (700 μg/kg body 
weight) (Talsness et al., 2008). Moreover, Mercado-Feliciano‘s study demonstrated that DE-71 showed a 
weak estrogenic activity in both MCF-7 breast cancer cells and an ovariectomized adult mouse model

IV. Negative associations between PBDE levels and thyroid 
hormones in cord blood 
Abstract 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) causing thyroidal effects have been 
demonstrated in in-vivo and in-vitro studies. PBDEs with structural similarities to 
thyroid hormones have increased recently, but the health effects for thyroid hormones 
have not been well studied. The study aimed to determine PBDE levels in cord blood 
and further to explore associations between prenatal PBDE exposures and thyroid 
hormones in cord blood. Fifty-four cord blood samples were collected after delivery. 
Cord-blood levels of BDE-15, 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 183 were analyzed 
using a high resolution gas chromatograph with a high resolution mass spectrometer. 
Thyroid hormones were determined by an automated chemiluminescence analyzer. 
The mean, median, and standard deviation of ΣPBDEs were 4.72, 3.49, and 6.36 ng/g 
lipid, respectively. To adjust for confounding by maternal age, pre-pregnant BMI and 
gestational age, stepwise multiple linear regression was used after log(2) 
transformation of the exposure variables. A doubling of BDE-154 was associated 
with 0.043 ng/ml lower Triiodothyronine (T3) values (adjusted r=-0.245, p=0.043). 
Likewise a doubling of BDE-153 was associated with 0.143 ng/ml lower free T3 
(FT3) values and a doubling of BDE-183 with 0.084 ng/ml lower FT3 values 
(adjusted r=-0.487, p=0.023). In contrast, the T4 (thyroxine)/T3 ratio increased by 
4.93 (adjusted r=0.277, p=0.017) when doubling BDE-100 exposure. No significant 
associations with BDE-47 or any other of the PBDEs was found. Our findings of an 
inverse relationship between BDE-153, BDE-154 or BDE-184 and thyroid hormones 
confirm the results of animal experiments but are in contrast to most epidemiological 
studies. 
Introduction 
Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are a class of brominated 
flame retardants, are widely used in a number of commercial products, such as 
furniture, textiles, and household electronic equipment (de Wit, 2002). PBDEs are 
known to bioaccumulate due to their high lipophilicity and resistance to physical, 
chemical, and biological degradation (Darnerud et al., 2001). PBDEs with structural 
similarities to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exhibit characteristics similar to 
those of PCBs, including persistence and bioaccumulation in the environment. 
PBDEs have been found to be increasing in human breast milk and blood since the 
1970s (Meironyté et al., 1999; Sjödin et al., 2004). In contrast, PCB levels in these 
two specimens have been declining, mainly due to the ban of PCBs use (Norén and 
Meironyté, 2000; Sjödin et al., 2004). Although the manufacture and use of PBDEs 
 were followed. 
The participants were selected mainly based on the following criteria: a 
minimum of three years living in the sampling area, a supply of sufficient cord blood 
(> 40 ml), and a willingness to strictly obey our protocols to prevent contamination 
prior to chemical analyses. More than 160 pregnant women were invited to join this 
program; of these, 95 agreed to answer the detailed questionnaire. Questions 
included the women‘s age, pre-pregnant BMI, parity, socioeconomic status, 
frequency of vacuum cleaner use, reproductive and pregnancy histories, smoking and 
dietary habits, alcohol consumption, medical history, occupational and 
non-occupational exposure to PBDEs, possible exposure to PBDEs from electronics, 
and potential exposure to PBDEs in transportation. Eighty mothers were first 
enrolled based on healthy status and voluntary donation of cord blood. Of the 80 
participants, 26 women who did not offer sufficient cord blood were excluded. 
Finally, 54 cord blood samples were obtained for further chemical analysis. 
Sample collection 
Umbilical cord blood was obtained from our participants by the obstetricians 
after delivery. Cord blood was first drawn for two tubes to determine thyroid 
hormones. Subsequently, a large volume of blood was collected from the umbilical 
cord vein after delivery. Cord blood was separated by centrifugation in the relevant 
hospitals and then transferred to our laboratory at National Pingtung University of 
Science and Technology. Finally, serum samples were coded, frozen, and kept at -80 
o
C before chemical analysis. Cord-serum samples of 20-25 ml each were packaged in 
chemically clean containers and transported to the Supermicro Mass Research and 
Technology Center at Cheng Shiu University in southern Taiwan for chemical 
analyses. 
Chemical analyses of cord-blood samples 
Eight PBDEs in cord serum, including BDE-15, 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, and 
183, were determined in the present study. The PBDEs standards were purchased 
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA, USA). The 
13
C-labeled 
standard of PBDEs was sourced from Wellington Laboratories (Guelph, Canada). 
The highest-quality sodium sulfate, alumina oxide, potassium oxalate, and silica gel 
were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).  
The analytical method for cord-serum PBDE levels has been described in our 
previous reports, and was used here with minor modifications (Chao et al., 2010a; 
Chao et al., 2010b; Koh et al., 2010). In brief, serum samples of 15 ml were extracted 
by sonication with a mixture of 45-ml acetone and 15-ml n-hexane, and these were 
then centrifuged. 
13
C12-labeled PBDE congeners of BDE-15, 28, 47, and 99 (100 
ng/mL), and 153, 154, and 183 (200 ng/mL) were added into the serum samples 
 Hospital. T3, T4, TSH, FT3, and FT4 commercial kits were purchased from 
Diagnostic Products Corporation (Los Angeles, CA, USA). The concentrations of the 
five thyroid hormones were measured using an automated chemiluminescence 
analyzer (Architect i-2000) (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA) by following 
the protocol from the manufacture. 
Statistical analyses 
For measurements below the limit of detection (LOD), PBDE concentrations 
were recognized as half of the LODs. Spearmen‘s rank correlation coefficients were 
initially tested to examine the relations between cord-serum PBDEs and thyroid 
hormones. In addition, correlations between PBDEs and T4×TSH, Free T4×TSH, 
T4/T3, and Free T4/T3 were examined by Spearmen‘s rank correlation coefficients 
tests. PBDE concentrations were not normally distributed using the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov method, but thyroid hormone levels were fitted to normal 
distribution. PBDE levels are logarithmically transformed to an approximately 
normal distribution after using the binary logarithm scale (log2). Associations 
between log2 PBDEs and thyroid hormones in cord blood were examined using a 
multiple linear regression stepwise method independent of maternal age, 
pre-pregnant BMI, and gestational age. Analyses were carried out using the 
Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 12.0. 
Results 
The descriptive statistics of the participants are given in Table 1. The means and 
standard deviations (SD) of maternal age and pre-pregnant BMI were 30.6 ± 5.01 yr 
(median=31.0 yr) and 23.2 ± 4.53 kg/m
2
 (median=21.8 kg/m
2
), respectively. 
Gestational age of newborns ranged from 36 to 40 weeks, with the mean of 38.5 
weeks. Averaged concentrations of T3, T4, TSH, FT3, and FT4 in cord serum were 
0.387 ng/ml, 9.04 μg/dl, 5.30 μIU/ml, 1.42 pg/ml, and 1.31 ng/dl, respectively. Table 
2 shows the concentrations of the eight PBDE congeners in cord serum. The mean, 
median, and SD of ΣPBDEs were 4.72, 3.49, and 6.36 ng/g lipid, respectively. 
BDE-47 and BDE-153 were the predominant congeners among the eight PBDEs, 
accounting for 25.2% and 26.5% of the ΣPBDE concentrations. The measurements 
of BDE-99 and BDE-100 were 83.3% and 85.0% higher than LODs with the means 
of 0.758 and 0.377 ng/g lipid, respectively. Fifty percent of BDE-28 and BDE-183 
congeners in cord serum were detectable in the present study. 
The associations between PBDEs and thyroid hormones in cord serum are 
shown in Table 3. T3 concentrations were significantly correlated with BDE-99 
(r=-0.327, p=0.017), BDE-154 (r=-0.314, p=0.022), and BDE-183 (r=-0.271, 
p=0.049), respectively. FT3 was inversely related with BDE-99 (r=-0.384, p=0.005), 
BDE-154 (r=-0.305, p=0.026), BDE-183 (r=-0.271, p=0.049), and ΣPBDEs 
 birth outcomes, including stillbirth, low birth weight, and premature delivery (Wu et 
al., 2010). In addition, increased cord-blood PBDE levels are significantly associated 
with decreased scores with regard to mental and motor neurodevelopment at 1-4 
years old (Herbstman et al., 2010). Although significant negative associations of 
breast-milk PBDEs with lower birth outcomes were found in our previous study 
(Chao et al., 2007), associations between cord-blood PBDEs and birth outcomes, 
including birth length, head and chest circumference, and gestational age were not 
found in the present work. This result is consistent with those in two previous studies 
(Wu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010) that investigated subjects around electronic 
waste recycling sites in China, and which found no associations between cord-blood 
PBDEs and birth length or gestational age. 
In Table 4, the higher log2 BDE-154 had a significant correlation with the lower 
T3 and inverse associations of FT3 with the increased log2 BDE-153 and log2 
BDE-183 were also found, but the increased T4/T3 ratio was significantly related 
with the increased log2 BDE-100 level. Surprisingly, cord-blood BDE-47 did not 
have correlations with thyroid hormones in the present study. Recently, several 
human studies have reported associations between cord-blood PBDEs and thyroid 
hormones (Mazdai et al., 2003; Herbstman et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2009; Roze et al., 
2009; Zhang et al., 2010). Although prenatal or postnatal PBDEs exposure induced 
reduced thyroid hormones in animal studies (Darnerud et al., 2007; Lema et al., 2008; 
Kodavanti et al., 2010) and hydroxylated PBDE metabolites have been shown to bind 
to thyroid hormones receptors with low affinity in in-vitro studies (Kitamura et al., 
2008; Kojima et al., 2009), the results of these previous epidemiological 
investigations into prenatal PBDEs exposure contradict those of the present study. 
However, an American cord-blood study (Herstman et al., 2008) found a similar 
trend to the present study with regard to the finding that BDE-100 correlated with an 
increased OR of low total T4 (TT4), while BDE-153 was associated with increased 
ORs of low TT4 and FT4. In contrast, no correlations were found between thyroid 
hormones and PBDEs in cord blood in the previous three studies (Mazdai et al., 2003; 
Kim et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010). Specifically, Kim et al. (2009) found no 
apparent relationship between fetal T4 and cord-blood PBDEs in 108 Korean infants. 
Zhang et al. (2010) discovered non-significant correlations between PBDEs and 
levels of total T3 (TT3), TT4, and TSH in 50 cord blood samples from Chinese 
infants at an electronic waste recycling site in southeast China. Finally, Mazdai et al., 
(2003) found no apparent correlations between ΣPBDEs and TT4 and FT4 in 12 
sample pairs of maternal and cord blood from the United States. On the other hand, a 
study in the Netherland found that increased T3 concentrations in cord blood were 
significantly correlated with increased BDE-47 (r=0.322, p=0.021), BDE-99
