上，使材質能獲得新的應用，如光學器材或生醫感測器等【23-24】。由上可以知道，溶膠之
用途極為廣泛，因此奈米功能性材料如能以液體型態出現，則在加工過程中就越具方便性，
尤其是在天然纖維紡織品的應用加工中更能顯示出其重要性。 
 
2) 共混法 
共混法是首先合成出各種形態的奈米粒子，再透過各種方式將其與有機聚合物混合，因
此又可分為溶液共混法、乳液共混法、熔融共混法等，其中以熔融共混法最被業界所使用。
此法是將表面處理過之奈米材料與聚合物混合，經過塑化、分散等過程，使奈米材料能均勻
分散在聚合物相中，達到對聚合體改質之目的，該法的優點是與普通的聚合物共混改質相似，
且因奈米粉体均勻分散在聚合物中，因而耐久性，所予的功能性穩定好，因此易於實行工業
化生產。 
 
二、在材料方面： 
PVP 是一種水溶性高分子，有水溶性高分子化合物的一般性質，保護作用、粘結性、吸
濕性、增溶或凝聚作用，但最具特色的是優良的溶解性能、生物相容性及絡合性，加上 PVP
毒性很低，因此在醫學、食品、化妝品與人們相關健康的領域中被廣泛的應用【25】。 
而幾丁聚糖(Chitosan，CHI)是幾丁聚糖(Chitin)去乙醯化產物。由於其價格便宜、性質穩
定、無毒、具生物分解性和有一活性強之胺基【26】，故可以應用在許多領域上，如廢水處理、
食品、紡織、農業、及生醫上【27-29】。甚至於有研究報告指出其可應用在光學領域上【30】。 
然而幾丁聚糖 (Chitosan)一方面因其不好的水溶性；另一方面由於其分子相對較大，而使其
用途受到限制。因此，改善其水溶性及降低顆粒尺寸，使其奈米化及增加水溶性是提高其使
用效果和耐洗堅牢度的有效途徑。 
奈米微粒材料的粒徑小於 100nm。金屬和金屬氧化物在細化為奈米粒子時，其比表面積
比正常粗粉大 3〜4 個量級，處於顆粒表面的原子數越來越多，界面極化和多重散射成為重要
的吸波機制。因此像奈米氧化鐵、氧化鎳、氧化銅或摻雜銻之氧化錫等如透過適當的加工可
以使聚合物對電磁波具有良好的遮蔽性能。甚至於像竹炭粉不僅具有產生負離子效果亦具有
很好的電磁波遮蔽功能。 
奈米材料與奈米技術的發展為開發保健紡織品提供了新的途徑，將奈米微粒加入到纖維

(polyacrylic acid) exhibit cost-effectiveness, good solubility and strong complex action. PVP 
also features biological decomposition. PVP and PAA are easy to mix with inorganic 
nano-particles, such as SiO2 or TiO2, so they not only form a network structure for an 
improved strength of polymer, but also form a porous surface presenting excellent 
water-tightness and impermeability [16–22].  
Owing to the good chemical and physical properties of nano-sols, modified nano-sols 
could greatly improve the functionality of the processed substances. Meanwhile, 
nano-materials in the liquid state are easier to process. Thus, this study attempts to discuss 
“preparation and properties of PAA/PVP copolymer and hybrid materials”. Firstly, it plans to 
prepare the copolymer of AA and NVP of different weight ratios, then prepare 
PAA-PVP/GYPTMS-Ag complex sol and hybrid material through the sol-gel process, and 
discuss the influence of AA /NVP with different weight ratios upon complex sols.  
 
EXPERIMENTAL 
Materials 
Acrylic acid (AA), ammonium peroxdisulphate, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), hydrochloric 
acid, all of which are reagents, was supplied by Osaka Pharmaceutical Corp. (Japan). 
N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidnone (NVP), 3-glycidoxypropytrimethylsilane (GYPTMS), both of which 
are reagents, were supplied by ACROS (U.S.), silver nitrate (99.5%), a special reagent, was 
supplied by WAKO Corp. (Japan).  
 
Methods 
Preparation of PAA-PVP Copolymers 
We first neutralized 60g of AA with the NaOH solution (27.2g of NaOH resolved in 80g of 
water at pH = 7) and cooled to room temperature, then diluted the above solution with water 
to 50%. 5g of NVP, 20g of AA-Na, 0.2g of glycerin and 0.05g of ammonium persulphate 
were put into the reaction chamber one by one (except the initiator), stirred and injected with 
helium for 20min. This mixture was heated to 40°C; we then added the initiator and began 
polymerization for 2h under nitrogen gas. The temperature was gradually increased to 70C°, 
and the polymerization process was started for another 3h to produce the PAA-PVP 
copolymer.   
 
Preparation of PAA-PVP/GYPTMS-Ag complex sol and its hybrid materials 
GYPTMS was dissolved with 35ml IPA and 3.6ml 0.05N HNO3, and 10ml 0.01%AgNO3 
solution was stirred for 60 min. The above-specified copolymer was mixed and stirred with 
GYPTMS sol for 3h at room temperature, there by obtaining a mixed sol of water-soluble 
PAA-PVP/GYPTMS-Ag complex sol. Then the complex sol was heated to obtain the hybrid 
material.

An S value >2.2 suggests that the sample has a bacteriostatic effect. 
Bactericidal value (L) = log (Ma/Mc)                 (3) 
An L value >0 suggests that the sample has a bactericidal effect. 
Ma = bacterial number in the sample of pure PAA-Na polymer immediately after rinsing.  
Mb = bacterial number in the sample of pure PAA-Na polymer after culturing for 18–24h.  
Mc = bacterial number in the sample of copolymers or hybrid materials after culturing for 
18–24h. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
FT-IR  
Figure 1-A depicts the spectra of the PAA/PVP copolymer with a weight ratio of 4:1. It 
can thus be seen that the PAA/PVP copolymer has an obvious C=O group absorption peak of 
PAA at 1722cm-1, and an obvious C=O group absorption peak of PVP at 1652cm-1. In 
addition, the COONa group absorption peak of PAA is at 1401cm-1, and the C–OH absorption 
peak is at 1135cm-1. This is because some AA has not yet neutralized with NaOH during the 
processing of AANa. Figures 1-B and 1-C depict the spectra of the copolymer with two 
weight ratios (2.5/2.5, 1/4). The difference with Figure 1-A includes: 1) COONa a group 
absorption peak shifts from 1401cm-1 to 1362cm-1, 2) C–OH absorption peak weakens 
gradually, 3) COONa absorption peak around 1590cm-1 then shifts towards the 
high-frequency area with a decline in the weight ratio of AANa. This is caused by the 
decreasing PAA content in the copolymer. Additionally, Figure 1-D shows hybrid material 
with an addition of 2% GYPTMS-Ag. As compared with the copolymer, the largest difference 
is that the hybrid material has an obvious Si–O–C or Si–O–Si absorption peak of GYMTPS at 
1096cm-1, 911cm-1 and 845 cm-1, but also a C–O–C absorption peak of GYPTMS at 
1096cm-1.  
 
Molecular weight and elemental analysis of copolymers 
 From Table II, the molecular weight of the polymer is seen to increase due to 
copolymerization with NVP, but the polydispersity is reduced, indicating that the molecular 
weight of C3 and C4 were distributed more narrowly.  Secondly, an elemental analysis of 
copolymers reveals a greater carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen content of C3 and C4. 
 
NMR Analysis 
 Figure 2 depicts the 13C-NMR spectra of the copolymer and hybrid material. It can thus 
be seen that, the copolymer has C=O group absorption peaks separately at 176.58ppm, 
176.62ppm and 177.68ppm. Figure 2-C shows an absorption peak at 182.93ppm, which is 
caused by the C=O of the –COONa group in PAA. Figures 2-A and 2-B do not show such an 
absorption peak due to the shortage of PAA-Na. In addition to an absorption peak at 
183.15ppm, Figure 2-D has an absorption peak at 170.47ppm. This proves that the C=O of 
 6 
effectively punch through the cell wall and cell membrane, so that the protein of the microbial 
cell is modified, leading to failure of breathing, metabolism and breeding, until death occurs. 
Table IV shows that the copolymer presents no anti-bacterial effect; on the contrary, the 
hybrid materials have an excellent bacterial effect due to their silver content. The bacterial 
effect of the hybrid materials is not related to the weight ratio of individuals.  
 
CONCLUSIONS 
This article has explored the preparation and properties of PAA-PVP/GYPTMS-Ag 
complex sols and its hybrid materials. The following conclusions are drawn from this article: 
1) it has been learnt from the FT-IR and NMR analyses that, AA and NVP will generate 
copolymerization, and that the copolymer will generate hydrogen bonding with the –OH of 
R–Si(OH)3 from GYPTMS-Ag. 2) The crystalline structure of the PAA/PVP copolymer will 
improve the crystallinity with the growing weight of NVP. 3) With the addition of 
GYPTMS-Ag, the thermal resistance of the hybrid materials will improve with the weight 
ratio of NVP. 4) The copolymer has no anti-bacterial effect; however, all the hybrid materials 
have an excellent bacterial effect.

ABSTRACT 
 The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the processing of wool fabrics with 
Polyacrylic acid- Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidnone)/3-glycidoxypropytrimethylsilane-Ag 
(PAA-PVP/GYPTMS-Ag) complex sols by means of dipping, pad, predrying and curing. The 
effect of complex sols on the properties of treated fabrics was analyzed, while FTIR was used 
to determine bonding between the complex sols and fabrics. The experimental results show 
that bonding actually occurs between the sols and fibers, and that the fixing property of dyes 
could be improved by 4–15% with increasing NVP weight ratio, GYPTMS concentration or 
sol concentration. The shrink-proofing and anti-bacterial properties of treated fabrics also 
improved markedly, with the former increasing with the NVP weight ratio.

INTRODUCTION 
Today, there is a growing demand for clothing with improved properties, for example, 
aesthetically pleasing and multi-functional fabrics are now increasingly favored. In such cases, 
the combination of nano-technology and fabrics can not only improve the fabric functionality, 
but also bring about added value. Nano-technology techniques are currently applied to fabrics 
to help them withstand UV ray exposure, static electricity, electromagnetic waves, far-IR and 
bacteria, as well as moisture and oil splashing [1–7]. Another new approach to improve the 
functionality of fabrics is to prepare inorganic oxide nano-sols using sol–sol technology. 
Owing to their characteristics of easier chemical or physical modification, nano-sols can 
greatly improve the performance of fabrics of higher value [8]. The basic principle of sol–sol 
technology means that it is both feasible and useful to apply this technique to the processing 
of functional fabrics. 
   Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) are inexpensive and 
water-soluble polymers with high complexation capability. PVP also presents biological 
decomposition properties. As pointed out by previous studies, PVP and PAA are easy to 
combine with inorganic particles such as SiO2 and TiO2, making it possible to form a mesh 
structure that improves the strength of the polymer, which also leads to a porous polymer 
surface presenting excellent water-tightness [9–15]. Thus, the copolymer can be adhered onto 
fibers, but when combined with inorganic nano-particles so that a mesh structure is formed

solution and was soaked and padded twice at a pick up 85%, then predried for 5 min at 80°C 
and heat-treated for 2 min at different temperatures (90–120°C). The treated fabric was 
washed and dried (It was named finished fabric), then loaded into bags for storage before 
checking the physicochemical properties. The fabric was named finished fabric. 
 
Analysis and measurement 
FT-IR/ATR spectra of the finished fabrics were recorded with a Bio-Rad Digilab 
FTS-200 spectrometer using an MCT detector. A diamond crystal was used as internal 
reflectance element. Single beam spectra were the result of 64 scans. The spectral resolution 
was 4 cm-1. The surface morphologies of the samples were observed with a JEOL Model JSM 
6400 scanning electron microscopic. A gold coating was deposited on the samples to avoid 
charging the surface. The K/S of the finished fabrics were measured by a Nippon ND 300A 
color-difference meter. The softness of the finished fabrics were measured by a INTECO 
softness tester with a 45o tilted platform. 
The finished fabrics were analyzed separately for their shrink-proofing property 
according to the AATCC TM 187-2001 method, as described in Table I.

Anti-bacterial property of the same sample was tested according to method JIS1902-1998 of 
the Japanese Association for the Functional Evaluation of Textiles (JAFET), and the following 
equations were used to calculate bacterial growth, bacteriostatic and bactericidal value: 
             Bacterial growth (F) = log (Mb/Ma)          (1) 
 F value >1.5 indicates significance in the experiment. 
            Bacteriostatic value (S) = log (Mb/Mc)            (2) 
S value >2.2 suggests the sample has a bacteriostatic effect.

than for unfixed fabrics, with a fixing rate of approximately 82%. The fixing rate for the fixed 
dyes ranges from 86% to 97%, an increase of 4–15%. This is primarily because a film of sol 
is formed on the dyed fabric surface, and epoxy radicals in GYPTMS react with the –NH2 
groups of the dye or the –Si(OH)3 moieties of GYPTMS formed during hydrolysis reaction 
and bonded to the dye, leading to better washing fastness of the fixed fabrics. Moreover, the 
dyeing property improves with the GYPTMS and sol concentration. On the whole, the 
softness of the fixed fabrics is affected by the sol and GYPTMS concentrations. As shown in 
Figure 5, the softness property of finished fabrics is poorer for a greater amount of GYPTMS 
or higher sol concentration, owing to the fact that a film is formed and accumulates on the 
fabric surface after drying of the sol. 
 
Effects of different sol components on dyed fabric properties 
Table IV lists the properties of dyed fabrics after fixing with different sols and 20 washes. 
It is evident that unfixed fabrics show much poorer shrink-proofing performance compared to 
the fixed fabrics. This is because the mesh-structure generated by GYPTMS polymerization 
can fully fill the gaps between fibers and reduce the probability of friction; on the other hand, 
a film layer of sol formed on the fiber surface is difficult to remove. Since NVP film 
formation occurs more easily than for PAA, the shrink-proofing performance will improve 
with an increase in the NVP weight ratio. 
 The fixed fabrics also present good anti-bacterial performance, primarily owing to the 
silver content on the fabrics. EDS analysis indicated that the amount of copolymer in the sol 
has little influence on the anti-bacterial property of the fabrics. In addition, the fixing property 
of the fabrics improves with an increase in NVP weight ratio in the copolymer, primarily 
because NVP has stronger complexing capability for silver, imparting a dark color to the 
fabrics. Moreover, the outstanding film-forming property of NVP ensures little discoloration 
after washing. When the concentration of silver nitrate increases to 0.1%, the finished fabric 
has a darker color than the unfixed fabric. In contrast, the reverse is true for the softness. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 This paper analyzed the influence of PAA-PVP/GYTPMS-Ag complex sols on fabrics 
finished using dipping, pad, predrying and curing. The following conclusions can be drawn 
from the experimental results: FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated the bonding of 
PAA-PVP/GYPTMS-Ag to wool fabrics. The fixing property for finished fabrics was 
improved by 4–15% as a function of the GYPTMS and sol concentrations. Sol fixation 
offered good shrink-proofing and anti-bacterial performance for finished fabrics, with 
shrink-proofing improving with an increase in the NVP weight ratio. The fixing property for 
finished fabrics increased with NVP weight ratio in the copolymer, while the softness 
decreased.

polarity and fine grains, the ultrafine powder is difficult to disperse in nonpolar substances. In 
addition, because tourmaline powder and high molecular polymer have quite different surface 
properties, it is difficult to combine them firmly. Direct filling negatively impacts some 
properties of the material and causes embrittlement, adversely influencing integration of the 
overall properties of the base material. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the surface of the 
tourmaline powder in order to resolve problems such as agglomeration, dispersibility, and 
compatibility with nonpolar substances [2].  
As scientific technology and the electronics industry develop, the electromagnetic 
pollution caused by the wide use of various appliances and electrical equipment has become 
regarded as the fourth largest public nuisance following atmospheric pollution, water 
pollution, and noise pollution. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) resulting from 
electromagnetic waves not only disturbs electrical equipment, but also seriously threatens the 
health of the human body [3]. For this reason, researchers have focused on how to reduce the 
strength of electromagnetic irradiation, avoid pollution of electromagnetic irradiation, protect 
the environment, and protect the health of the human body [4].  
With high mechanical strength, good abrasion resistance, stable chemical characteristics, 
and fine self-lubrication, nylon 6 engineering plastic is widely used in automotive spare parts, 
electrical appliances, and the petrochemical industry. However, the application range of nylon 
6 is limited because it has poor thermal and acid resistance, as well as a low impact resistance, 
high absorption rate, low transparency, and low solubility in a low temperature environment. 
To meet the requirements of different application fields, the properties of nylon 6 can be 
improved through blocking, blend grafting, and filling. Industry and academia have focused 
on nylon 6 nanocomposites due to their high strength, thermal resistance, high barrier, 
flame-retardant properties, ease of processability, and excellent overall characteristics [5].  
Various inorganic conductive fillers are often added to the polymeric base material. The 
antistatic polymeric materials manufactured through this technology have a high application 
value and are mostly commercialized in foreign countries. Commonly used raw materials 
include: 1) the carbon black series, such as graphite, carbon black, and carbon fiber; 2) metals, 
such as metal powder and fragments, and fibers, such as metallized glass fibers and mica 
plated with nickel, copper, chrome, and stainless steel; and 3) other series, such as inorganic 
salts or metal oxides [6]. 
The most notable disadvantages of carbon black filler are the large filling amount and 
poor adjustability, which limit its application in many fields. Although the copper, iron, and 
aluminum included in metal fillers are easily oxidized and reduce the conductivity rate of the 
system with time, it is difficult to use them on a large scale because the price of gold and 
silver is high. In addition, the metal particle content must reach 70% to make any substantial 
reduction in the surface resistivity coefficient. Such a high content will influence the 
mechanical and spinning properties of the polymer [7]. Therefore, we selected carbon fiber as 
the conductive filler for this study.

the finished fabrics were recorded with a Bio-Rad Digilab FTS-200 spectrometer using a 
mercury–cadmium–tellurium (MCT) detector. A diamond crystal was used as the internal 
reflectance element. Single-beam spectra resulted from 64 scans. The spectral resolution was 
4 cm–1. The thermal resistance of the samples was measured by a DuPont 2200 weight-loss 
analyzer. The 5 – 10 mg samples were placed in alumina crucibles and tested at a thermal 
ramp over a temperature range of  
30 – 600ºC at a heating rate of 20ºC/min under a nitrogen flow speed of 20 cc/min, after 
which their initial decomposition temperature (IDT) was obtained. The surface morphologies 
of the films were observed with a JEOL Model JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope. A 
gold coating was deposited onto the samples to avoid surface charging. 
 
Air Anion Test 
First, a controlled-environment room was operated for more than 2 hours with the temperature 
controlled to 20 ± 5ºC and the relative humidity controlled to 65 ± 5%. Then, the anion-test 
sample was placed in the center of an airtight acryl box, and the box was placed into the room 
with an anion tester (Andes, ITC-201A). The fan switch was turned on to blow air over the 
test sample and the anion tester was started. Each test lasted for 10 min. The maximum, 
minimum, and average number of anions tested were recorded at regular intervals by the 
anion tester.  
 
Far Infrared Ray Thermal Image Temperature Test  
As shown in Figure 1, to test the composite membrane sample, it was first placed on the 
sample mount, and a 500-W halogen lamp was installed at an angle of 45o and a distance of 
100 cm. An infrared thermal imaging system (AGEMA, Thermovision 900) was placed over 
the test sample at a distance of 50 cm. During this period, pictures were taken at regular 
intervals to analyze the surface temperature of the sample, and the temperature difference 
before and after irradiation were compared to determine the incremental temperature of the 
sample. When the temperature difference of the test sample and of the raw sample for 0.5℃ 
above, we could assume that the composite membrane provided heat preservation and thermal 
insulation from the far infrared rays.

FTIR 
From Figure 2A, the main functional group of pure nylon 6 had an absorption peak at 1638 
cm–1, which corresponded to the stretching vibration absorption peak of >C=O.  There was 
also an absorption peak at 1541 cm–1, which corresponded to the vibration absorption peak of 
the inside of amide N-H. Figure 2B shows a graph of stearic acid. An absorption peak of 
>C=O at 1737cm–1 appeared on the main functional group. Figure 2C shows a plot for the 
composite material. Two absorption peaks appeared at 637 and 1544 cm–1 on the main 
functional group with no great difference from those of pure nylon 6, but there was an 
additional absorption peak at 1703 cm–1. According to the above plots, the absorption peak of 
>C=O was displaced because after stearic acid CH3(CH2)16COOH was decomposed to 
CH3(CH2)16COO-, CH3(CH2)16COO- combined with Ca2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, etc., ions at the surface 
activity center of tourmaline.  
Through an FTIR analysis, it was possible to fabricate an improved 
tourmaline powder that had a good interface for combination 
and could effectively infiltrate into the base material in 
order to improve its dispersibility.  
 
TGA 
From Figure 3, as the nylon 6/tourmaline/carbon fiber composite was heated to 500ºC, the 
residual and initial decomposition temperature of the composite increased with the tourmaline 
content while the decomposition rate decreased, indicating that increasing the tourmaline 
content could effectively improve the thermal resistance of nylon 6 and slow down the rate of 
decomposition.  
The TGA data of the composite is shown in Table 1. The initial decomposition 
temperature of nylon 6 was 394.83ºC, and the decomposition speed of –1.767%/ºC indicated 
quick decomposition. When the temperature reached 500ºC, 5.589% of the composite 
material still remained. The initial decomposition temperature in Figure 3 and Table 1 2-B, 
2-C, and 2-D were 404.95ºC, 406.76ºC, and 408.56ºC, and the decomposition speeds were 
–1.628%/ºC, –1.383%/ºC, and –1.342%/ºC, respectively. When heated to 500ºC, the residuals 
of the composite material were 23.731%, 24.124%, and 29.049%. From the above data, the 
initial decomposition temperature, decomposition speed, and residuals were all better than 
those for pure nylon 6, indicating that adding tourmaline could improve the thermal stability 
of nylon 6.  
When the tourmaline content was 16%, the thermal resistance, decomposition speed, and 
initial decomposition temperature reached optimal values because the improved tourmaline 
actually served as a crosslinking point for nylon 6 that was good for entwisting the nylon 6 
chains and physical crosslinking. A good interface for the combination of the filling particle 
and the base material was available such that it could serve as a chemical crosslinking point.

value, possibly due to saturation of the heat preservation effect.  
According to the irradiation principle of far infrared rays, after absorbing energy, the far 
infrared radioactive tourmaline powder emits far infrared rays and produces a thermal effect 
[14]. Therefore, the tourmaline powder in the composite material produced a thermal effect 
after absorbing the far infrared ray energy, and thus made the surface temperature of the 
composite material higher than the nylon 6 base material without tourmaline powder.  
A continuous increase in the amount of filling provided little help in improving the heat 
preservation thermal insulation effects. As the tourmaline powder content increased to 16%, 
there was no substantial change in the heat preservation effect, possibly due to the heat 
preservation reaching saturation, and the large specific surface area and high specific surface 
energy of nano-tourmaline powder causing the agglomeration phenomenon, thus influencing 
the heat preservation and thermal insulation effects.  
 
Surface resistance coefficient 
As shown in Figure 5, the surface resistance of pure nylon 6 was approximately 
1014 Ω/cm, and the surface resistance coefficient tended to decrease as the tourmaline content 
increased, mainly because a conductive net was formed as the content of the conductive fillers 
increased.  
When the tourmaline content increased by 2%, the surface resistance coefficient of the 
composite material decreased to 1.47×108 Ω/cm. When the tourmaline content increased to 4 
wt%, the surface resistance coefficient of the composite material decreased to 1.04×107 Ω/cm, 
forming a steep curve, which indicates that a sound and close conductive net with the carbon 
fiber in the nylon 6 material formed at this tourmaline content, i.e., the percolation region of 
percolation theory [15]. As the tourmaline content increased to 8% and 16%, the surface 
resistance coefficient of nylon 6 decreased to 2.50×107 and 2.47×107 Ω/cm, respectively, and 
the curvature tended to be mild. From this curve, the critical concentration of added 
tourmaline to nylon 6 was approximately 4 wt%; when the tourmaline content increased to 
8%, no dramatic change in the surface resistance coefficient was observed.  
 The resistance of electrostatic eliminating materials falls between the resistance values of 
conductive materials and insulating materials, approximately 106 – 1012 Ω/cm. Static is mainly 
caused by the accumulation of inflow charges, and thus a reduction of the surface resistance 
can effectively release the charge accumulated on the material surface. Like conductive 
materials, electrostatic eliminating materials can transmit electrons, but at a speed between 
conductive and insulating materials [16]. As indicated by the above results, the surface 
resistance of the tourmaline/carbon fiber/nylon 6 composite material prepared in this study 
had a minimum value of 107 Ω/cm. For this reason, it could be used as a material to eliminate 
static.  
 
Electromagnetic Wave Shielding Effect (SE)

caused decomposition speed to decrease.  
3) SEM showed that an appropriate amount of tourmaline could evenly disperse throughout 
the base material and mix with the carbon fiber, thus acting in a complementary manner 
with the conductive network of the composite material.  
4) From the results of the anion tester, the nylon/tourmaline/CF composite material with 
added tourmaline powder improved with stearic acid and had a good anion release 
performance. The number of dynamic anions tended to increase with the tourmaline content. 
When the tourmaline increased to 8%, the number of anions decreased.  
5) Testing the heat preservation and thermal insulation properties of the composite material 
with an infrared thermal imaging system indicated that the surface temperature of the nylon 
6 composite material with added tourmaline powder increased by 5.1ºC – 7.6ºC, and the 
incremental temperature tended to increase with the tourmaline content. When the 
tourmaline powder content increased to 8%, the increasing temperature reached a 
maximum value. Further increases in the filling content did not improve the heat 
preservation thermal insulation effects.  
6) The data from the four-point probe low-resistance tester and the electromagnetic wave 
shielding effect tester indicated that with the tourmaline appropriate content, the surface 
resistance coefficient could reach a maximum value of 1.04×107 Ω/cm when the percolation 
concentration was approximately 4%. This is within the range of 106 – 1012 Ω/cm for 
electrostatic eliminating materials. The maximum electromagnetic wave shielding effect 
was 30 dB/MHz.

ABSTRACT 
     Chitosan was degraded into low-molecular-weight chitosan (LWCS) using different 
concentrations of H2O2. Then different concentrations of tripolyphosphate (TPP) were 
incorporated to make nanochitosan. The effects of LWCS on nanochitosan particle size and 
the zeta potential are discussed. The cross-linking was best when the LWCS/TPP mass ratio 
was approximately 5:2, at which nanochitosan particles formed and the zeta potential 
measured at this moment was minimal. A lower molecular weight corresponded to a smaller 
nanoparticle size. 
 
Keywords:  Chitosan; degradation; tripolyphosphate, zeta potential, nanoparticle size. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
     Nanochitosan is a natural material with excellent physicochemical properties, making it 
a superior environmentally friendly material, and it possesses bioactivity that does not harm 
humans. It is frequently used as a controlled-release drug carrier for gene transfer in artificial 
organs and for immune prophylaxis. In addition, nanochitosan has been used to improve the 
strength and washability of textiles and to confer antibacterial effects [1]. Nanochitosan can 
be prepared by using coagulation or precipitation, covalent cross-linking, ionic cross-linking 
and emulsion droplet coalescence methods. Berthold et al. [2] initially prepared chitosan 
particles using sodium sulphate as the precipitation agent. This involves adding Tween 80 to 
chitosan acetic acid solution as the dispersant and then adding sodium sulphate solution to this 
solution dropwise whilst stirring, ultrasonicating the mixture and determining whether 
particles have formed from the solution turbidity. Tian and Groves [3] improved this 
technique and obtained 600–800-nm chitosan nanoparticles. In 1994, Ohya et al. [4] used 
glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent to cross-link the free amino groups of chitosan; this 
was emulsified using a water-in-oil (W/O) emulsifier, producing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
chitosan particles (average particle size: 0.8 ± 0.1 µm). In 1989, Bodmeier et al. [5] first 
applied the ionic cross-linking method to prepare chitosan nanoparticles. They added 
tripolyphosphate (TPP) cations to chitosan solution, which generated intermolecular

distribution and zeta potential of the chitosan nanoparticles were determined using a Zetasizer 
3000HSA (Malvern Instruments, Southborough, MA, USA). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Elemental analysis and viscosity and molecular weight measurements 
After H2O2 treatment, the molecular weight and viscosity of the chitosan decreased and 
continued to decrease as more H2O2 was added (Table 1). This was due to the degradation of 
the chitosan molecular chain by H2O2, which oxidizes the -OH and -NH2 groups into -COOH 
groups. Therefore, the N content of the LWCS decreased as the H2O2 volume increased, while 
the O content increased (Table 1). The C and H contents did not change significantly, except 
for C15. For C15, O had the largest percentage increase compared to the other elements, 
indicating that C15 degradation occurred. 
 
FT-IR 
 Figure 1 shows the IR absorption spectra of chitosan, Figure 1-A shows that of chitosan, 
1-B was that of C15 nanomized chitosan. It can be seen that, three spectra, A, B, had similar 
peaks, locations, and intensities [10]. In Figure 1-A, at 1598cm-1, there was an –NH2 
absorption peak. While in Figure 1-B, besides the same absorption peak found in Figure 1-A, 
it can be observed that an –NH2 stretch vibration absorption peak drifted to a low wave 
number in 1-B, this indicated that the phosphate group linked to the amino group and formed 
strong intermolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bond[11].  
 
Particle size 
     The concentrations of the LWCS and TPP solutions and ratio of LWCS to TPP by 
weight have an important effect on nanochitosan preparation [12-13]. As the TPP 
concentration was increased, the reactive product changed in three stages, clear liquid, 
opalescent fluid and precipitate, as shown in table 2 and fig.2. When the TPP concentration 
was too low (TPP ≤ 13.8 mg·ml–1), too few phosphate groups were present to produce 
effective electrostatic attraction with the chitosan amino groups; hence, the solution became 
clear or no nanometric LWCS-TPP sphere composite structure existed. As the TPP content 
was increased gradually, the solution became opalescent when the LWCS/TPP mass ratio was 
approximately 5:2, which was when nanochitosan particles could be obtained. Thereafter, as 
the TPP content was increased gradually, the emulsion became increasingly obvious, and a 
precipitate ultimately formed, probably due to coagulation of the excessive nanochitosan [14]. 
The size of the formed particles increased correspondingly. Table 2 shows the effect of the 
LWCS molecular weight on the nanometric LWCS-TPP particle size: the lower the LWCS 
molecular weight, the smaller the particles derived from the chitosan and TPP reaction [15]. 
This occurs because the charge stability of the chitosan nanoparticles is associated with the 
 50 
LWCS/TPP mass ratio was 5:2, at which the zeta potential was also minimal, indicating that 
the nanoparticles prepared from LWCS had a lower surface potential.

ABSTRACT 
     In this study, we used the low molecular weight chitosan (LWCS) to prepare 
nanochitosan (NCH) and apply to the wool fabric finishing treatment. The diameters and zeta 
potential of the nanochitosan decreased as the value of the molecular weight of chitosan 
decreased. Additionally, the wool fabric was treated with various types of chitosan. The 
anti-bacterial and shrink-proofing properties of the treated fabric are ranked as following: 
NCH>LWCS>chitosan. The former two properties also increased as the concentration of 
nanochitosan increased. In addition, the nanochitosan-treated wool fabric possesses better 
anti-bacterial and shrink-proofing properties after washed for 20 times.

INTRODUCTION 
           Chitosan is the deacetylated product of chitin. Next to cellulose, chitin is the 
second most  
abundant polysaccharide in nature (Rathke TDet al, 1994). Chitosan has been used in a very 
wide range of applications, such as prevention of water pollution by chelating heavy metals or 
radioactive isotopes; in membrane separation (Aiba S et al, 1986); in medicine and 
biotechnology; and in the food areas.  either as a food packaging material because of its 
antibacterial action (Wong DWS et al, 1992; Ghaouth A EI et al, 1991) or as dietary fiber and 
a potential medicine against 
 hypertension thanks to its scavenging action for chloride ions (Okuda H, 1995; Ishikura S, 
1993; Muzzarelli RAA, 1996). 
     Nanochitosan is a natural material with excellent physicochemical properties, making it 
a superior environmentally friendly material, and it possesses bioactivity that does not harm 
humans. It is frequently used as a controlled-release drug carrier for gene transfer in artificial 
organs and for immune prophylaxis. In addition, nanochitosan has been used to improve the 
strength and washability of textiles and to confer antibacterial effects (Ting DR et al.,2005). 
Nanochitosan can be prepared by using some methods. (Berthold et al.,1996) initially 
prepared chitosan particles using sodium sulphate as the precipitation agent. Tian and Groves 
(Tian XX et al.,1999) improved this technique and obtained 600–800nm chitosan 
nanoparticles. In 1994, Ohya et al. (Ohya Y et al.,1994) used glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking 
 60 
with distilled water, freeze-dried and analysed, denoted N-Cn (N-C5, N-C10 and N-C15), 
respectively. 
 Finishing process of wool fabric with nanochitosan 
The 0.5g〜2g N-Cn was dissolved into 200 ml (2%) acetic acid solution and stirred until 
complete dissolution..  Wool fabric were dipped into the N-Cn solution for 5 minutes by 2 
dips 2 nips process (to soak twice (5mins/each time), with a pressing step after each soaking), 
pick-up about 90%, under 80 ℃, pre-dry 5 minutes, and then curing for 3 minutes under 100 
℃.  Then the properties of the treated wool fabric were tested. 
 
Analysis of LWCS and nanochitosan 
     The particle size distribution and zeta potential of the chitosan nanoparticles were 
determined using a Zetasizer 3000HSA (Solvent：water, Malvern Instruments, Southborough, 
MA, USA). The treated fabrics were measured for their shrink-proofing property according to 
the AATCC TM 187-2001 method.    The anti-bacterial properties of the samples were 
tested according to method JIS1902-1998 of the Japanese Association for the Functional 
Evaluation of Textiles (JAFET). The following equations were used to calculate the bacterial 
growth, bacteriostatic and bactericidal values: 
 Bacterial growth (F) = log (Mb/Ma)          (1) 
An F value >1.5 indicated statistical significance in the experiment. 
 Bacteriostatic value (S) = log (Mb/Mc)          (2) 
An S value >2.2 suggested that the sample had a bacteriostatic effect. 
 Bactericidal value (L) = log (Ma/Mc)          (3) 
    An L value >0 suggested that the sample had a bactericidal effect. Ma was the 
bacterial number in the sample of un-pretreating fabrics immediately after rinsing. Mb was the 
bacterial number in the sample of un-pretreating fabrics after culturing for 18–24 hours. Mc 
was the bacterial number in the sample of the pretreatment fabrics after culturing for 18–24 
hours. 
 Investigations on the leaching behaviour were performed at 40  using a Rapid H℃ -type 
dyeing machine. As washing solution an 1% aqueous solution of sodium lauryl sulfate SDS 
with pH 7 was used. After a leaching 20 minutes the textile samples were rinsed intensively 
with water, dried at room temperature and physical properties again investigated after 20 
times wash. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 Particle size 
     Some experts pointed out that the concentrations of the LWCS and TPP solutions and 
the ratio of LWCS to TPP by weight have important effects on nanochitosan preparation 
(Bodmeier R et al.,1989).  Table Ⅰ shows the effect of the LWCS molecular weight on the 
 62 
2 g/L and TPP concentration 1.5 g/L, the fabric shrink-proof rate approximately was 3%-10%, 
to bacteriostasis of rate the E.coli was 74.7% [Guo FZ et al., 2008]. The results showed that 
the nanoparticles size of finishing agent can enchance the effect of the wool fabric.  
 The shrinkage of the untreated fabrics in both the warp and the weft direction is larger 
than that of the treated fabrics, as shown in TableⅡ. This result is because the yarn of the 
untreated fabrics is stretched taut during weaving, whereas the treated fabrics have reactive 
polymers completely covering the fiber scales or an even layer of protective thin membrane 
formed over the surface. In turn, the latter would make the tightness of the yarn, the structure 
of the fabric, and weaving density more restrictive to the movement of individual fibers. 
Under such circumstances, the fibers in the treated fabric would, of course, become much 
more resistant to outside forces and not glide against each other; that is, the fabric would 
become more shrink-proof (Liu CT et al.,1997). Therefore, when the osmosis of chitosan in 
fabric is better, the area covered by chitosan on the surface of the fiber becomes larger. 
Nanochitosan-treated fabric has better shrink-proofing properties. It was noticed also that 
shrinkage in the warp direction was always greater than that in the weft direction. This 
difference is because the warp yarn is stretched more tightly than the weft yarn during 
weaving, which is also the main reason why woollen fabrics are prone to shrink when heated. 
The shrink-proofing of treated fabrics is improved with the reduction of the molecular weight 
of LWCS and with increase of the concentration of N-Cn. 
 
Wash fastness 
 Tabe Ⅲ shows the antibacterial and shrink-proof properties fastness of treated fabrics 
after they had been washed 20 times. The fastness of the untreated fabric was very poor. The 
treated fabric with the chitosan is worse than N-C10 on the antibacterial and shrink-proofing 
properties. This shows that the particle size of the nanochitosan is smaller and its osmosis is 
higher the nanochitosan is smaller and its osmosis is higher leading to the difficulty to be 
washed out. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
     In this study, we degraded chitosan into LWCS, then nanomised it and produced 
nanochitosan (NCH). Then, wool fabric was treated by various types of chitosan again. The 
anti-bacterial and shrink-proofing properties of the treated fabric are ranked as following: 
NCH>LWCS>chitosan. The former two properties also increased as the concentration of 
nanochitosan increased. In addition, the nanochitosan-treated wool fabric is able to provide 
better anti-bacterial and shrink-proofing properties after washed 20 times.

肆、自評 
 
(一) 與原計畫相符程度 
本計畫與當初申請時之進度及內容相似度約在 90%，不同點為 1)第一年所
製備之複合溶膠原先規劃是利用 AA, NVP, TEOS 及 AgNO3 等製成，後來
考 慮 到 會 合 溶 膠 之 穩 定 性 及 反 應 性 ， 乃 利 用
GYPTES(3-glycidoxypropytrimethylsilane)取代 TEOS(Tetraethoxysilane).2)第
三年原先規劃將 Chitosan 改質成水溶性再製成奈米幾丁聚醣，然因本實驗
為連續性關係，在先前已完成低分子量 chitosan 之製作，因低分子量 chitosan
是水溶性，故本計劃乃直接利用低分子量 chitosan 製成奈米 chitosan。 
  
(二) 達成預期目標情況與學術成果及應用價值 
本計畫總共完成 5 篇文章，8 位學生之訓練培養，訊練過程中能讓這些學生
從實驗之規劃、執行及報告之撰寫等都能有計畫的完成，透過如此的訓練
不但可以讓學生在研究所之推甄得以順利，而且可以順利找到工作。其中
有 6 位學生因而順利錄取研究所 (國立 3 位，私立 3 位)；另 2 位目前在工
作。除此之外，透過本計畫之執行可以找到以溶凝膠的技術合成出各種多
功能性的整理加工劑及多功能性複合材之製備，對於綠色特用化學品及多
功能性纖維之製備具有重要之參考價值。 
     
(三) 本計劃總共完成 5 篇文章，已投稿 3 篇，其中 2 篇已接受 (皆為第三年之
計畫，投稿於 Carbohydrate Polymer)；另一篇 (第二年計畫)投 Polymer 
Composites 中，第一年之兩篇已完成投稿準備，最近可以實行且準備投到
Materials Manufacturing Process 或 Journal of Applied Polymer Science. 未來
本計畫擬提出兩項之發明專利，分別是奈米複合溶膠之製備及應用和多功
