2Abstract
In this study, performance of heat sinks using the copper foams as heat-sinking material is
investigated experimentally. The copper foam is fabricated by electroplating technique using
polymer foam with pre-coated silver film as the precursors. The manufactured copper foams have
the porosity, pore density (pore per inch, PPI), permeability and inertial coefficient in the ranges
of 0.5~0.8, 10~40, 0.6~ 29102 m and 1.5~3, respectively. Besides the copper-foam heat sink,
performances of single-channel, plate-fin and pin-fin heat sinks are also investigated and
compared with copper-foam heat sinks.
The experimentally measured results show that the thermal resistances of copper-foam heat sinks
are better than the single-channel, plate-fin and pin-fin heat sinks because of special flow features
inside the porous media, enlarged heat-transfer area and enhanced heat transfer coefficient. Detail
comparisons between the results of copper-foam heat sinks indicate that the thermal resistance of
copper-foam heat sink decreases with the decrease in porosity and increase in pore density. The
pressure drop crossing the copper-foam heat sink increases with the increase in pore density and
decrease in the porosity.
Keywords: copper-foam heat sink, permeability, inertial coefficient, and thermal resistance.

異，電子元件朝微小化及高功率發展，元件散熱更成為一具挑戰性之要求。在散熱裝置中，
微流道熱沉為一可達到高散熱量之散熱裝置。尤其當沸騰熱傳使用於微流道熱沉 (兩相微

42.1 Basic heat sink configuration
The metal foam heat sink to be studied is schematically shown in Fig. 1. At the center of a
copper block with bulk size of 58mm36mm3.5mm, a rectangular cavity is cut with the
dimension of 38mm20mm2mm. The metal foam with the dimension of 20mm20mm2mm
is placed at the center of the cavity. The remained volume of the cavity is designed as the inlet
and outlet plenums that distributing and collecting the fluid passing through the heat sink. At the
top of the heat sink, a cover plate also made by copper with pre-drilled holes is screwed onto the
heat sink to form the closed flow passage. For the plate-fin and pin-fin heat sink, the volume
where the copper foam occupied is replaced by plate-fin and pin-fin arrays. The detail
arrangement and dimension of the plate fin and pin fin arrays are shown in Fig. 2.
2.2 Copper foam fabrication
In fabricating the copper foam using the electroforming technique, a precursor is needed. As
shown in Fig. 3(a), three polymer foams with different porosities and PPI=10, 20, and 40 are used
as the precursors in this study. The PPI of foam is measured by counting the number of pores in
one inch. Because the polymer is electrically non-conductive, electrically conductive layer must
be coated onto the polymer surfaces before the electroforming can be started. Using HCOOH and
AgNO3 as the reduction and oxidation agents, a silver (Ag) film can be coated onto the polymer
foam surface and serves as the seed layer for electroforming. The electroforming process is
performed at room temperature and the copper sulfite is used as the electrolyte. During the
electroforming, the electrolyte is stirred by air in order to have uniform electroforming inside the
polymer foam. The electroforming thickness is controlled by the applied electric current density
and time duration. To prevent failure during the electroforming process, low current density of
600mA/cm2 is employed. By controlling the electroforming time duration, we are able to obtain
the copper foam with various porosity for a given polymer foam. Fig. 3(b) shows some typical
fabricated copper foams with porosity and PPI (, PPI) = (0.868, 10), (0.721, 20) and (0.615, 40)
are shown. The porosity is measured by the volume displaced by the copper foam. The bulk size
of each foam has the dimension of 20mmX20mmX2mm. In this study, 9 different copper foams
are fabricated as listed in Table 1. As indicated in Table 1, for PPI=10, 20, and 40, copper foams
with  in the range of 0.595 to 0.868 are fabricated. For convenience in discussion, these
copper foams are divided into three groups according to their PPI value.
3. Experimental setup
Schematic diagram of the experimental setup for testing the performance of heat sink is shown in
Fig 4(a). The main components of the test apparatus are an open-loop fluid handling system, heat
sink test module and data acquisition system. In the fluid handling system, a
positive-displacement pump (P151-391TI, Milton Roy, Ivyland, PA, USA) was used to pump the
fluid from a reservoir. It can be operated at a variable rotation speed to supply various flow rates.
6The permeability K and inertial factor FC are two important factors in describing the fluid flow
across the porous medium. These two factors can be related to pressure drop by the modified
Darcy equation expressed as,
2V
K
C
V
KL
p F  (1)
where p is the pressure drop across the copper foam, L is the length of copper foam in the flow
direction,  is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid,  is the density of fluid and V is the
Darcian velocity defined as,
cA
Q
V  (2)
WhereQ is the volumetric flow rate in the heat sink and cA is the cross-sectional area of the
heat sink in the flow direction. Using the heat sink test module, p appeared in Eq. (1) can be
determined as,
clearfill ppp  (3)
where fillp and clearp are the measured pressure drops with and without the copper foam in
the heat sink. In Fig. 5, the measured Lp / for all the copper foam heat sinks studied are
presented for the flow rate varies from 30 to 100ml/min. As shown in Fig. 5, the pressure drop
increases with the increase in PPI and decrease in porosity. Using the measured Lp / shown
in Fig. 5, the permeability and inertial factor can be obtained directly from curve fitting by
quadratic polynomial and listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the permeability and inertial
coefficient of the copper foam studied in the present study are in the ranges of 0.6 to
29102 m and 1.5 to 3, respectively.
4.2 Heat transfer characteristics of copper foam
8The heat sink performance is usually represented by its thermal resistance which can be defined
as,
"
max
q
TT
R finwth

 (8)
where maxwT is the maximum temperature of the heat sink at the wall. In order to represent the
average heat sink performance, we use wT to evaluate thR instead of maxwT . The calculated
thR as function of flow rate for each heat sink studied are presented in Fig. 7. As shown in Fg. 7,
thR is reduced when the flow rate increases. A detail comparison from Fig. 7 indicates that Rth
can be reduced when the copper foam has low porosity and high PPI value.
Finally, we compare the performance of copper-foam heat sink with those of single-channel,
plate-fin and pin-fin heat sinks under the same operation conditions. As shown in Figure 8, it is
clearly seen that the copper-foam heat sink produces lower thermal resistance as compared with
those of single-channel, plate-fin and pin-fin heat sinks. By using the plate-fin heat sink as
reference, the copper-foam heat sink can reduces the thermal resistance up to approximately 20%.
5. Conclusion
In this study, copper foam fabricated using the electroplating technique was employed as the
heat-sinking material. Because of the special flow characteristic of fluid flow in the copper foam
and enlarged heat transfer area, the copper-heat sink has better performance as compared with
those of single-channel, plate-fin and pin-fin heat sinks. The measured results also indicated that
the thermal resistance of copper-foam heat sink decreases with the increase of porosity which is
controlled by the electroplating time.
