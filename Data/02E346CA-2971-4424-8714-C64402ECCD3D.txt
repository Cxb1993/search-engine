Abstract 
Many functional RNAs have evolutionarily 
conserved secondary structures in order to 
fulfill their roles in a cell. A lot of works have 
been done for single RNA structure prediction; 
however, as more RNA sequence data have 
been produced, finding characteristic 
structure motifs within RNA families becomes 
very important. Unlike some methods that find 
consensus structures from a multiple sequence 
alignment if available or others that align 
sequences and structures simultaneously, our 
approach separates consensus motif finding 
from sequence folding. After applying RNA 
folding algorithms to each sequence of given 
RNAs as a preprocess, we then combine 
structure decomposition and Gibbs sampling 
techniques to identify common structure 
motifs in unaligned RNA sequences. To 
demonstrate the performance, we tested it on 
several RNA families in Rfam. The 
experimental results show our new approach 
is competitive with other current prediction 
systems. 
Keywords: RNA, secondary structure,

Introduction 
 
Most of the current structural 
bioinformatics research is focused on proteins, 
and yet thousands of genes produce transcripts 
exerting their functions without ever 
producing protein products [1-3]. We can 
easily argue that the comprehensive 
understanding of the biology of a cell requires, 
besides proteins, the knowledge of the 
identities of all functional RNAs (both 
noncoding and protein-coding) and their 
molecular structures. 
A fundamental principle of biology is that 
a stable 3D structure is essential for biological 
functions. Many functional RNAs have 
evolutionarily conserved structures in order to 
fulfill their roles in a cell. Some of the 
functions can be presented by functional 
motifs, such as several well-understood 
structurally conserved RNA motifs in viral 
RNAs, e.g. the TAR and RRE structures in 
HIV and the IRES regions in Picornaviridae 
[4]. Although experimental assays for 
basepairing in RNAs constitute the most 
reliable method for secondary structure 
determination, yet it is often difficult and 
expensive to acquire the 3D spectrum data of 
RNA molecules [5].  
Various computational methods for the 
prediction of RNA secondary structures have 
been developed. According to the search 
strategies applied and the structure 
representations used, they can be roughly 
 4 
seqalign(si,sj) and structalign(si,sj) are 
normalized between zero and one. Note that 
we assign zero to sim(si,sj) directly when 
RLD(si,sj) is greater than θL to save the time 
for the computation-intensive alignment 
procedures. The motivation behind this is our 
observation of most families in Rfam shows 
that the relative length difference between 
family members is usually insignificant, 
which makes it an effective filter. In eq.(2), 
sim(si,sj) is computed as the weighted sum of 
the sequence and structure alignment scores, 
where w1+w2=1.  
The Gibbs sampling process in our system 
starts with an initial state of a consensus motif 
represented by a set of seeds, SEED, each of 
which is a possible occurrence of the motif in 
a particular RNA sequence. In each iteration, 
we sample the motif patterns for one RNA, e.g. 
R, conditioned on the currently selected motif 
occurrences in the others, and a structure 
pattern pi ∈ R will be chosen as a new seed 
(i.e. a new motif occurrence) if it satisfies 
either of the following conditions. 
 
If R does not currently have a seed in SEED, then  
∑ ∈⋅= SEEDs kjpi kj spsimSEEDp (4)                               ),(/1maxarg 
under the constraint that

If R already has a seed in SEED, then 
∑ ∉∈⋅−= RsSEEDs kjpi kkj spsimSEEDp , (5)              ),()1/(1maxarg  under the constraint that  
sRsSEEDs kikk
spsimSEED θ>⋅− ∑ ∉∈ , ),()1/(1  
 
As we iterate over every RNA, we can either 
add new patterns as new motif occurrences 
when the above condition is satisfied, or 
delete old seeds from the seed set if they no 
longer meet the constraint. We update the set 
SEED with the aim to increase the total 
pairwise pattern similarity simtotal(SEED) 
defined below. We repeat the same sampling 
process until no change of motif occurrences 
can be made to improve simtotal(SEED).

The initial seeds determine where and how 
fast Gibbs sampling converges, and the size of 
the initial seed set does not need to be equal to 
the total number of the RNAs given. Since we 
can start Gibbs sampling with different initial 
seeds, it can terminate at various sets of final 
seeds. When Gibbs sampling stops after it 
converges, the size of converged SEED will 
ideally be equal or approximate to that of the 
given RNA family, and the seeds per se are 
the predicted occurrences of a consensus motif. 
According to simtotal, we rank all the motifs to 
which Gibbs sampling converges, and report 
them in a sorted list after the user specifies the 
number of top-ranked motifs required in the 
output. 
 
Experimental Results 
Several recent tools were selected for 
comparison, including MARNA [21], 
CMfinder [22], and RNAshapes [33]. As these 
algorithms were derived from different design 
philosophies, we followed Yao et al. [22] to 
test each algorithm on the same input data 
using default parameter settings to conduct a 
reasonably fair and consistent comparative 
study. 
We picked 7 families of different sizes 
from the Rfam database as the test data. The 
seed alignment for each family is considered 
the consensus motif, whose number of 
hairpins varies from one to three among 
different families. Unlike Yao et al. [22], who 
included a fixed number of genomic sequence 
bases (e.g. 200 bases), we instead included 
genomic sequence flanking the motif such that 
the ratio of the motif length to the sequence 
total length is set between 0.1 and 0.6 at 
random, to reflect the reality that motif 
positions are usually unknown. The smaller 
the ratio, the larger the length difference 
between motifs and sequences. The average 
flanking genomic sequence length can then 
vary from 50 to more than 250 bases for 
different families. As the length of genomic 
flanking sequences has a larger deviation by 
our setting, the test data are more challenging 
than Yao et al.’s, and these test datasets are 
summarized in Table 1. 
The performance was measured at the base 
pair level relative to the Rfam annotation. We 
compared the predicted motif against the 
annotated seed alignment provided in Rfam. 
Let Pt (true positive) denote the number of 
base pairs that exist in annotated seed 
alignments and are correctly predicted, Pf 
(false positives) denote the number of base 
pairs that do not exist in annotated alignments 
but are predicted, and Nf (false negatives) 
denote the number of base pairs that exist in 
seed alignments but are not predicted. The 
overall accuracy of a prediction is computed

目前國內已有許多研究單位的多位學者及專家致力於核糖核酸之相關研究，其中包含
RNAi 的研究居多，成果也大多局限於資料庫的開發。國內學術研究的重點多以論文發表
為主軸，除了強調引用次數以提升國內在國際的學術地位外，與國外研究方向相較，鮮少

ABSTRACT 
Appropriate postoperative pain management contributes to earlier mobilization, shorter hospitalization, and reduced cost. Undertreatment of pain 
may impede short-term recovery, and may even have a detrimental long-tern effect on health. Despite the advancement in postoperative pain 
management, pain relief and patient satisfaction still does not meet some patients’ requirement. By applying data mining techniques, this study 
aimed to identify the predictive factors for anesthetic dosage and PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) demands. With the assistance of Changhua 
Christian Hospital, we collected 1655 PCA patient records. We analyzed patient PCA usage profiles. We concentrated on two prediction tasks in 
this study: (a) postoperative analgesic consumption, and (2) PCA setting readjustment.

Intramuscular (IM), Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA), decision trees, bagging, clustering 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Pain is one of the most commonly reported postoperative symptoms (Chung, et al., 1996). It is a highly personal experience 
influenced by multiple factors, including sensitivity to pain, age, genetics, physical status, and psychological factors (Turk and 
Okifuji, 1999; Bisgaard, et al., 2001). Along with the progress of medical science, people gradually become aware of the importance 
of pain management. 
Intramuscular (IM) opioid injection is the most commonly used treatment for postoperative pain relief. However, different 
surgeries cause different degrees of pain, and pain endurance varies among people. IM opioid injection does not take effect until 
several tens of minutes, and it is hard to know beforehand the correct analgesic dosage to meet the patient’s need. On the other hand, 
PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) is a delivery system for pain medication that makes effective and flexible pain treatments 
possible by allowing patients to adjust the dosage of anesthetics themselves. From previous research (Walder, et al., 2001; Dolin, et 
al., 2002), PCA has become one of the most effective techniques for postoperative analgesia. It is widely used in hospitals for the 
management of postoperative pain, especially for major surgeries. In this paper, we concentrate on the study of PCA. 
There are two objectives in this paper. First, we investigate the correlation between PCA demand profiles and patient physical 
states. The motivation is that with better knowledge of the correlations, anesthesiologists can prescribe appropriate PCA settings for 
 6 
the correlation between cluster membership and each single attribute, we measured the associations between cluster membership 
and a set of attributes based on mutual information, as defined below.

where I(C;A) is the mutual information used to measure the association between the cluster membership C and the attribute set A. 
H(C) is the marginal entropy of C, and H(C|A) is the entropy of C conditional on A. The cluster membership presents all the legal 
clusters, i.e. p(Ci ) =1! , and the attribute set specifies the attributes selected to reduce uncertainty, which satisfies p(Ai ) =1! , and 
each Ai represents a possible attribute value combination. Mutual information, which is a symmetric measure to quantify the 
statistical information shared between two distributions (Cover and Thomas, 1991), provides a sound indication of the shared 
information between a pair of variables. The motivation is to remove the uncertainty about cluster membership as much as possible 
by knowing about some subset of attributes. We normalized mutual information to avoid the natural bias in mutual information that 
favors attributes with many values (Quinlan, 1993), or a set of attributes with many value combinations. Several normalizations are 
possible based on the observation that I(C;A) ≤ min(H(C);H(A)). They include normalization using the arithmetic or geometric 
mean of H(C) and H(A). Since H(X) = I(X;X), we adopted the geometric mean because of the analogy with a normalized inner 
product in Hilbert space (Strehl and Ghosh, 2002). We define the normalized mutual information as: 
 
I(C;A)norm =
I(C;A)
H (A)H (C)
 
 
We consider a set of patient attributes with higher normalized mutual information is more related to the PCA demand profiles, and 
thus worth further medical analysis. 
Since A is any subset, except the empty set, of the total attributes A, there are 2|A|-1 possibilities of A. Currently we have only 15 
attributes other than PCA setting and demand related attributes. They can produce 215-1 different attribute subsets. We computed the 
normalized mutual information of every attribute subset to evaluate the correlation between the patient's behavior in using PCA and 
his (or her) physical states or surgery-related attributes. 
2.2 PCA Dosage and Control Prediction 
Given the physical states of patients and their early-hour PCA demand profiles, we first wish to predict the total anesthetic dose 
taken in later hours. In this work, we focused on longer early-hour PCA usage profiles than those in (Hu, et al., 2010). As in 
previous works, we tried to predict the symbolic value of anesthetic dose as we noticed that the dose could generally fall in several 
distinct ranges. We divided the numeric value of dosage into several intervals. This was done by an iterative optimization procedure 
that identified the cut-points such that the dose deviation in each interval was minimal. We then discretized the numeric value of 
anesthetic dose into a number of symbolic values, e.g. “low”, “medium” and “high.”  
We can compare and evaluate prediction methods according to their accuracy and comprehensibility. The accuracy of a 
predictor refers to its ability to correctly predict the target value, e.g. total anesthetic dosage, for previously unseen data; the 
comprehensibility of a predictor refers to the level of ease with which humans can interpret the predictions. A predictor that is able 
to make both accurate and comprehensible predictions is most desirable, but unfortunately, for any prediction method available,

pattern, and presented them in Figure 2. For clarity, we also presented an enlarged version of the representative pattern in clusters 
two and three in Figure 3.  
 
 
Figure 2. Representative PCA Demand Patterns in three clusters 
For all possible attribute subsets of the 15 patient physical states, and surgery-related factors, we calculated the normalized 
mutual information to evaluate their association with the PCA demand patterns. The top two attribute subsets were listed in Table 1, 
and a random small attribute subset was included for comparison. The results showed that more than half of the attributes related to 
PCA demand, and they interacted. Also note that the normalized mutual information is small as H(A) in the denominator is large 
due to the large number of attribute value combinations. To verify if the difference in normalized mutual information between the 
top and the second attribute subsets is merely by chance, we performed a bootstrap test for estimating the confidence interval. It 
showed that the difference was not random but rather significant at the level of p-val < 0.05. Despite the low normalized mutual 
information, our experimental results demonstrated that these 15 attributes contributed to a patient’s PCA demand behavior 
differently. It encouraged us to identify more factors and different interactions to better characterize PCA demand behaviors.

We first compared bagging with AdaBoost when classes were imbalanced, and then applied either under-sampling or 
over-sampling to balance classes. The goal of PCA readjustment prediction is to predict correctly the patient whose initial PCA 
settings require modification. Appropriate performance measures proposed include the F-score (Lewis and Gale, 1994) of positive 
examples, and the geometric mean of positive accuracy and negative accuracy (Kubat and Matwin, 1997). The other measures, e.g. 
overall accuracy, were included for reference. We showed the results in Table 3. All the values were averaged over the 10 runs in a 
10-fold cv. We found that without removing “dirty” data, Bagging combined with under-sampling performed the best in both 
measures of positive F-score and geometric accuracy. Nevertheless, without under-sampling to balance the classes, bagging had 
very poor performance, even worse than the baseline original C4.5. These experimental results indicated that class imbalance had a 
stronger impact on bagging than on boosting. Class imbalance in our PCA data misled bagging toward the majority class. Like in 
Table 2, we used an asterisk to indicate the significantly better performance of bagging combined with under-sampling technique in 
a paired t-test, e.g. the positive F-score of bagging with under-sampling outperformed all the others significantly. The results also 
showed that ANN and SVM were severely biased by the majority class.

We next tested our strategy for data cleaning and class balancing. After removing “dirty” negative examples, we reduced the 
ratio of negative to positive from 81:19 to 65:35. We presented the results in Table 4. Compared against Table 3, our data cleaning 
strategy improved all the classifiers in positive F-score and geometric accuracy except ANN and AdaBoost with undersampling. 
The classifier that gained the most from data cleaning was bagging. 
4. CONCLUSION 
 
We introduced a real-world application of data mining to anesthesiology. To increase patient satisfaction, we have analyzed PCA 
patient data, and run several experiments to evaluate the potential of applying data mining algorithms to assist anesthesiologists in 
PCA control. The results demonstrated the feasibility of our combinatorial approach to medical applications.  
Previous research (Walder, et al., 2001; Dolin, et al., 2002) has shown PCA is one of the most effective techniques for 
postoperative analgesia and widely used in hospitals for the management of postoperative pain. Though PCA provides the medical 
staff with a convenient way to control pain, it requires constant attention, e.g. manually collecting each patient’s PCA data, printing 
out analgesia usage data, entering readings into appropriate databases, etc.
