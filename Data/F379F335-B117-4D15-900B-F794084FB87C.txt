隨著無線通訊技術與寬頻網際網路的發
展日趨成熟，隨時隨地無線上網的願景即
將實現。在過去幾年當中，傳輸分集技術
有相當深入地研究以改善無線系統的錯
誤性能，許多新的時空碼不斷地被發明出
來。時空區段碼可使用簡單的解碼架構達
到完全分集，但無法提供額外的編碼增
益。時空籬柵碼能夠獲得最佳分集增益與
一些編碼增益，但其編碼增益仍然不夠
好。將一個外部碼與時空區段碼作聯結可
以獲得更高的編碼增益，然而外部碼的保
護位元會造成聯結碼的傳輸率下降。為了
改善這項缺點，若以時空區段碼的擴展集
合作為聯結碼的內碼，將不會有傳輸率下
降的問題。在本計畫中，我們首先建構時
空區段碼的集合分割，配合多階層區段碼
設計出多階層時空碼。之後我們將藉由結
合迴旋碼與多階層時空碼的擴展集合，提
出一項時空籬柵碼的新設計。預期此項新
技術可以有效改善傳輸率下降的問題，同
時會有相當不錯的性能與低複雜度。
關鍵詞：時空區段碼、籬柵碼、多階層時

Abstract
Over the past several years, transmit
diversity has been studied extensively to
provide improved error performance for
wireless systems. Many space-time coding
schemes, including space-time block codes
and space-time trellis codes, have been
proposed. Space-time block codes provide
full diversity and a very simple decoding
scheme. However, they do not provide the
additional coding gain. Space-time trellis
codes can provide full diversity gain as well
as additional coding gain at the price of
higher decoding complexity. By
concatenating an outer trellis encoder and an
inner space-time block code, the
concatenated scheme can achieve full
diversity gain and improved coding gain.
However, the outer code has redundancy
and the overall transmission rate of the
concatenated scheme is reduced. Hence, the
set of inner space-time block code needs to
be expanded to achieve a higher coding rate.
For our new scheme, a multi-level
space-time code is first constructed by
concatenating several block codes and the
set partitioning of a space-time block code.
Then, a new space-time trellis code by
combining a convolutional code and the set
partitioning of an expanded set of
multi-level space-time codes is presented. It
is expected that the new space-time trellis
code has good error performance and low
decoding complexity.
Keywords: Space-time block codes, trellis
codes, multilevel space-time codes.

Example 2: Let ,,, 210 CCC and 3C denote
the (4,4,1), (4,3,2), (4,2,2), and (4,1,4)
binary linear block codes, respectively. We

Note that 5V is in fact STC-1. The partition
chain 510 /// VVV  has increasing intraset
CGD of 4, 16, 16, 16, 16, and 64,
respectively.
The encoding for the proposed scheme is
shown in Figure 1, which is similar to that
for a coset code [11]. An ),,( ccc mkn
convolutional code encoder of memory
order cm uses ck message bits as input
and generates an output branch consisting of
cn bits, which are used to select one of the
cn2 cosets of the multilevel space-time code,

transmitted from the STBC encoder. In the
trellis for the ),,( ccc mkn convolutional
code, each branch corresponds to a coset of
the multilevel space-time code. Suppose that
the partition chain zz VVV /// 10  has
increasing intraset CGD of ,, 10  z
and ,z respectively. We choose a
convolutional code such that the coset of zV
represented by the branches emanating from
a given state are all in the same coset of
1zV and the coset of zV represented by
the branches entering a given state are all in
the same coset of .1zV Hence, it can be
calculated that the free CGD between any
two distinct code paths is

that ,4 1 zz   where z is the

code, we can gain ck additional information

between any two distinct code paths
