2I. INTRODUCTION
Due to its theoretical as well as application importance in
the fields such as multi-dimensional digital filtering, linear
image processing, signal processing, process control, and
so on [1]–[3], the two-dimensional (2-D) systems have at-
tracted increasing attentions. As is known, when the 2-D
systems is implemented by a state-space model with the finite
wordlength format, the saturation nonlinearities may appear in
2-D systems. The presence of such nonlinearities may result in
instability and may oc,fmsys1curs the zero-input limit cycles.
Therefore, the stability problem of 2-D systems with saturation
nonlinearities has drawn much attention from researchers. See,
e.g., [4]–[14], and references cited therein.
On the other hand, time-delays are frequently encountered
in engineering and biological systems, and are often a source
of instability and poor performance. For 1-D state-delayed
systems, a great number of results on the stability analysis
have been obtained [15]–[17]. In practical implementations of
2-D systems, however, time delay may occur due to finite
numerical computation time and the saturation nonlinearities
may produced due to finite wordlength format, that can
be represented as 2-D state-delayed systems with saturation
nonlinearities. Therefore, the study of 2-D systems with time
delays has received much attention in recent years; see, for
example [18]–[23], and the references therein. Recently, the
problem of stability analysis for discrete-time systems with
constant delays subject to saturation nonlinearities has been
addressed [24], [25]. However, the proposed condition in [24],
[25] was 1-D state-delayed systems, rather than 2-D state-
delayed systems. Therefore, it is natural to try to derive similar
results on the same problems of 2-D state-delayed systems
with saturation nonlinearities.
This Project is concerned with the asymptotic stability of
2-D systems described by the Fornasini-Marchesini second
local state-space model [26] and the Roesser model [27]
under interval time-varying delays and saturation nonlinear-
ities. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, both the delay-
independent and delay-dependent conditions are derived to
ensure the asymptotic stability for the addressed system.
Furthermore, the conditions are expressed in terms of the linear
matrix inequalities [28]. Some illustrative example are given
to show the effectiveness and applicability.
The notation used throughout the paper is quite standard.
Z is the set of non-negative integers, Rn is the n-dimensional
Euclidean space, and Rn×m is the set of n×m real matrices.
PT stands for the transpose of a matrix P , and P > 0 (< 0)
means that P = PT is positive definite (negative definite).
The boldface characters represent matrix variables. In block
matrices, ? is used as an ellipsis for the transpose of the block
at the symmetric position.
II. FORNASINI-MARCHESINI SECOND LOCAL
STATE-SPACE MODEL
A. Delay-independent Conditions
1) System description: Consider the 2-D state-delayed
systems described by Fornasini-Marchesini second local state-
space model with saturation nonlinearities
x(i+ 1, j + 1) =φ(ξ(i, j))
=
[
φ1(ξ1(i, j)) · · · φn(ξn(i, j))
]T
ξ(i, j) =
[
ξ1(i, j) · · · ξn(i, j)
]T
=A1x(i+ 1, j) +A2x(i, j + 1)
+Ad1x(i+ 1, j − d1) +Ad2x(i− d2, j + 1)
(1)
where x ∈ Rn is the state vectors, A,Ad ∈ Rn×n are system
matrix with compatible dimensions. d1 and d2 are positive in-
tegers denoting delays along vertical and horizontal directions,
respectively. φk(ξk(i, j)) is saturation nonlinearities given by
φk(ξk(i, j)) =
 1, ξk(i, j) > 1ξk(i, j), −1 ≤ ξk(i, j) ≤ 1−1, ξk(i, j) < −1
 , (2)
where k = 1, 2, · · · , n. The boundary conditions are defined
by
{x(i, j) = sij , ∀ i ∈ Z and j = −d1,−d1 + 1, . . . , 0},
{x(i, j) = tij , ∀ j ∈ Z and i = −d2,−d2 + 1, . . . , 0},
s00 = t00, (3)
where sij and tij are given vectors. The following definition
and lemma will be used later.
Definition 1: [22] The system (1) is asymptotically stable
if lim`→∞ χ` = 0 for all bounded boundary conditions in (3),
where
χ` = sup {‖x(i, j)‖ : i+ j = `, i, j ≥ 1} .
Definition 2: [29], [30] A square matrix Z = [zij ] ∈
Rn×m is called diagonally dominant matrix if
zii ≥
n∑
j 6=i
|zij |, ∀ i = 1, 2, · · · , n.
2) Stability analysis: In this section, a sufficient condition
for the asymptotic stability of systems (1)-(2) is presented.
Theorem 1: If there exist positive definite symmetric ma-
trices P1 ∈ Rn×n, P2 ∈ Rn×n, Q1 ∈ Rn×n, Q2 ∈ Rn×n,
and matrix N = (nij) ∈ Rn×n such that
Ξ =

n∑
j=1
|nij |, i = 1, 2, · · · , n, (5)
where
Ψ = N+NT − (P1 +P2 +Q1 +Q2), (6)
then system (1)-(3) is asymptotically stable.
Proof: To discuss the stability, choose the following
Lyapunov functional candidate as
ν(i+ θ, j + τ) = νh(i+ θ, j + τ) + νv(i+ θ, j + τ)(7)
4whereΨ is defined in (6), then system (16) is asymptotically
stable.
4) Example: Consider the system (1) with
A1 =
[
0.9 −2.1
0.1 0.2
]
, A2 =
[
0.1 −0.05
0.06 0.02
]
Ad1 =
[ −0.1 0.05
−0.01 −0.1
]
, Ad2 =
[ −0.03 0
−0.01 0.1
]
.
By using the LMI Control Toolbox [31] to solve Theorem 1
as follows:
P1 =
[
1.5558 −3.6420
−3.6420 18.5654
]
,
P2 =
[
0.2979 0.0165
0.0165 1.3876
]
,
Q1 =
[
0.2179 −0.3014
−0.3014 3.0117
]
,
Q2 =
[
0.0998 −0.1009
−0.1009 2.8209
]
,
N =
[
2.1548 −1.8508
−3.7856 21.7927
]
.
Therefore, according to Theorem 1, the present system is
asymptotically stable.
B. Delay-dependent Conditions
1) System description: Consider the 2-D discrete-time
systems with time-varying delays and saturation nonlineari-
ties described by the Fornasini-Marchesini second state-space
model [26]
x(i+ 1, j + 1) = φ(ξ(i, j))
=
[
φ1(ξ1(i, j)) · · · φn(ξn(i, j))
]T
(21)
where
ξ(i, j) =
[
ξ1(i, j) · · · ξn(i, j)
]T
= A
[
x(i+ 1, j)
x(i, j + 1)
]
+Ad
[
x(i+ 1, j − d1(j))
x(i− d2(i), j + 1)
]
,
(22)
where x ∈ Rn is the state vector. The matrices
A =
[
A1 A2
]
, Ad =
[
Ad1 Ad2
]
,
where A1, A1, Ad1 and Ad2 are known constant matrices
with compatible dimensions. d1(j) and d2(i) are time-varying
delay along vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. We
assume d1(j) and d2(i) satisfying
d1L ≤ d1(j) ≤ d1H , d2L ≤ d2(i) ≤ d2H , (23)
where d1L, d1H , d2L, and d2H are constant positive scalars
representing the lower and upper delay bounds along vertical
and horizontal directions, respectively. φk(ξk(i, j)) is satura-
tion nonlinearities given by in (2). The boundary conditions
associated with system (21) are defined in (3).
Lemma 1: [32] For any vectors δ(t) ∈ Rn, two positive
integers κ0, κ1, and matrix 0 < R ∈ Rn×n, the following
inequality holds
−(κ1 − κ0 + 1)

.
2) Stability analysis: The delay-range-dependent condi-
tions for ensuring the stability of systems (21) is presented in
the following theorem.
Theorem 3: Given positive integers d1L, d2L, d1H and d2H ,
if there exist matrices 0 < P1 ∈ Rn×n, 0 < P2 ∈ Rn×n,

6For presentation convenience, we give the definitions and
identities in (36), shown at the bottom of the next page, where
X and Y are symmetric diagonally dominant matrix and N is
a diagonally dominant matrix. Substituting (34)-(35) into (33),
one has

= θT(i, j)Ξθ(i, j)− ρ− ε1 − γ1, (37)
where ρ, ε, ε1, ε2, γ, γ1 and γ2 are defined in (36),
θ(i, j) = [xT(i + 1, j), xT(i, j + 1), xT(i + 1, j −
d1(j)), xT(i−d2(i), j+1), xT(i+1, j−d1H), xT(i−d2H , j+

Υ13 = −W1 −R13,
Υ14 = −W2 −R23,
Υ21 = (P1 +P2 +Q1 +Q2). (38)
Note that α1, β1, and γ1 can be expressed as follows:
α1 =
n∑
k=1
{2[ξk(i, j)− φk(ξk(i, j))][nkkφk(ξk(i, j))
+
n∑
l=1,l 6=k

 ,
β1 =

{2[ξk(i, j)− φk(ξk(i, j))][xkkφk(ξk(i, j))

+
n∑
l=1,l 6=k
yklφl(ξl(i, j))]
 . (39)
By conditions (25)-(27) and the saturation nonlinearities (2),
α1, β1, and γ1 are nonnegative. Therefore, it can be established
that ∆ν(i, j) < 0 for all θ(i, j) 6= 0 if conditions (24)-(27)
are satisfied. It follow from (29)-(32) and ∆ν(i, j) ≤ 0 that∑
i+j=N+1
ν(i, j) ≤
∑
i+j=N
ν(i, j). (40)
Obviously, the sum of the Lyapunov functional value is
decreasing along the state trajectories. Then, from [10], we
can conclude that
lim
i→∞and/orj→∞
x(i, j) = lim
i+j→∞
x(i, j)→ 0 (41)
which implies that system (21) is asymptotically stable. This
completes the proof of the Theorem 3.
Remark 1: By defining 2-D Lyapunov functions and by us-
ing diagonally dominant matrices, a delay-dependent stability
condition has been obtained for 2-D systems with time-varying
delay subject to saturation nonlinearities. Moreover, Theorem
7 is a standard LMI form, which can be easily solved by
Matlab LMI toolbox [31].
3) Uncertain systems: Consider the uncertain 2-D state-
delayed systems described by Fornasini-Marchesini second
local state-space model with saturation nonlinearities
x(i+ 1, j + 1) =φ(ξ(i, j))
=
[
φ1(ξ1(i, j)) · · · φn(ξn(i, j))
]T
ξ(i, j) =
[
ξ1(i, j) · · · ξn(i, j)
]T
=(A1 +∆A1)x(i+ 1, j)
+(A2 +∆A2)x(i, j + 1)
+(Ad1 +∆Ad1)x(i+ 1, j − d1(j))
+(Ad2 +∆Ad2)x(i− d2(i), j + 1) (42)
The saturation nonlinearities φ(·) are defined in (2). The norm-
bounded parametric uncertainties are defined in (17)-(18).
Then we have the following Theorem.
Theorem 4: Given positive integers d1L, d2L, d1H and d2H ,
if there exist a scalar ² > 0 and matrices 0 < P1 ∈ Rn×n,
0 < P2 ∈ Rn×n, 0 < Q1 ∈ Rn×n, 0 < Q2 ∈ Rn×n, 0 <

then system (42) is asymptotically stable for any time varying

time-varying delay and saturation nonlinearities (21), where

We assume that the lower and upper delay bound along vertical
direction are given d1L = 3, d1H = 5. Our purpose is to
determine the lower and upper delay bound along horizontal
direction such that the system (21) is asymptotically stable
for any time varying delay d1(j) ∈ [d1L, d1H ] and d2(i) ∈
[d2L, d2H ]. For this example, if we assume d2L = 2, then by

The saturation nonlinearities ϕhk(ϑhk(i, j)) and ϕvl (ϑvl (i, j)) are
defined in (50)-(51), respectively. The norm-bounded paramet-

where H,Ea, and Ed are known real constant matrices with
appropriate dimensions, and F (i, j) is an unknown real and
time-varying matrix satisfying
FT(i, j)F (i, j) ≤ I (65)
Then we have the following Theorem.
Theorem 6: If there exist a scalar ² > 0 and positive definite
symmetric matrices Ph ∈ Rm×m, Pv ∈ Rn×n, Qh ∈ Rm×m,
Qv ∈ Rn×n, and matrix M = [mij ] ∈ R(m+n)×(m+n) such

then system (63)is asymptotically stable.

where state dimensions m = 2 and n = 1. By using the LMI

 .
Thus, according to Theorem 5, the present system is asymp-
totically stable.
B. Delay-dependent condition
1) System description: Consider the 2-D discrete-time
systems with time-varying delay subject to saturation nonlin-
earities described by
xh(i+ 1, j)
xv(i, j + 1)
= ϕ(ϑ(i, j)) =
ϕh(ϑh(i, j))
ϕv(ϑv(i, j))
ϑ(i, j) =
ϑh(i, j)
ϑv(i, j)
= A
xh(i, j)
xv(i, j)
+Ad
xh(i− dh(i), j)
xv(i, j − dv(j)) (69)
where xh ∈ Rm is the horizontal state vectors, xv ∈ Rn is
the vertical state vectors, A,Ad ∈ R(m+n)×(m+n) are system
matrix with compatible dimensions. The matrices
A =
[
A11 A12
A21 A22
]
, Ad =
[
Ad11 Ad12
Ad21 Ad22
]
, (70)
dh(i) and dv(j) are time-varying delay along vertical and
horizontal directions, respectively. We assume dh(i) and dv(j)
satisfying
d1L ≤ dh(i) ≤ d1H , d2L ≤ dv(j) ≤ d2H , (71)
where d1L, d1H and d2L, d2H denote the lower and upper
delay bounds along vertical and horizontal directions, respec-
tively. ϕhk(ϑhk(i, j)) and ϕvl (ϑvl (i, j)) are saturation nonlin-
earities given by (50) and (51), respectively. The boundary
conditions are defined by (52).
2) Stability analysis: In this section, a delay-dependent
sufficient condition for the asymptotic stability of systems (69)
is presented.

d2H , if there exist matrices 0 < P =

IV. CONCLUSIONS
The problem of delay-dependent stability for 2-D sys-
tems described by the Fornasini-Marchesini second state-
space model with interval time-varying delays and saturation
nonlinearities is addressed in this paper. With a 2-D Lya-
punov functional proposed and diagonally dominant matrices
introduced to the derivative of it, a linear matrix inequality
approach is developed to derived sufficient conditions for the
systems to be asymptotically stable. An example is given to
illustrate the usage of the proposed approach.

Stability Analysis of 2-D State-Delayed Systems with Saturation
Nonlinearities
Shyh-Feng Chen
Abstract— This paper addresses the stability problem of 2-
D state-delayed systems described by the Fornasini-Marchesini
second local state-space and the Roesser models under sat-
uration nonlinearities. In terms of linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs), a sufficient condition is derived to ensure the asymptotic
stability of the systems. Two numerical examples are given to
demonstrate the theoretical results.
I. INTRODUCTION
Due to its theoretical as well as application importance in
the fields such as multi-dimensional digital filtering, linear
image processing, signal processing, process control, and so
on [2], [6], [16], the two-dimensional (2-D) systems have
attracted increasing attentions. As is known, when the 2-
D systems is implemented by a state-space model with the
finite wordlength format, the saturation nonlinearities may
appear in 2-D systems. The presence of such nonlinearities
may result in instability and may occurs the zero-input
limit cycles. Therefore, the stability problem of 2-D systems
with saturation nonlinearities has drawn much attention from
researchers. See, e.g.,[7], [8], [9], [10], [13], [14], [15], [18],
[19], [20], [21], and references cited therein.
On the other hand, time-delays are frequently encountered
in engineering and biological systems, and are often a source
of instability and poor performance. For 1-D state-delayed
systems, a great number of results on the stability analysis
have been obtained [3], [5], [17]. In practical implemen-
tations of 2-D systems, however, time delay may occur
due to finite numerical computation time and the saturation
nonlinearities may produced due to finite wordlength format,
that can be represented as 2-D state-delayed systems with
saturation nonlinearities. Recently, the problem of stabil-
ity analysis for discrete-time systems with constant delays
subject to saturation nonlinearities has been addressed [11],
[12]. However, the proposed condition in [11], [12] was 1-D
state-delayed systems, rather than 2-D state-delayed systems.
Therefore, it is natural to try to derive similar results on the
same problems of 2-D state-delayed systems with saturation
nonlinearities.
This paper deals with the asymptotic stability of 2-D
state-delayed systems described by the Fornasini-Marchesini
second local state-space and the Roesser models under
saturation nonlinearities. A computationally tractable LMI-
based [1], [4] sufficient criterion will be derived.

The notation used throughout the paper is quite standard.
Z is the set of non-negative integers, Rn is the n-dimensional
Euclidean space, and Rn×m is the set of n×m real matrices.
PT stands for the transpose of a matrix P, and P > 0 (< 0)
means that P = PT is positive definite (negative definite).
The boldface characters represent matrix variables. In block
matrices, ⋆ is used as an ellipsis for the transpose of the
block at the symmetric position.
II. FORNASINI-MARCHESINI SECOND LOCAL
STATE-SPACE MODEL
A. System description
Consider the 2-D state-delayed systems described by
Fornasini-Marchesini second local state-space model with
saturation nonlinearities
x(i+1, j +1) = φ(ξ (i, j))
=
[ φ1(ξ1(i, j)) · · · φn(ξn(i, j)) ]T
ξ (i, j) = [ ξ1(i, j) · · · ξn(i, j) ]T
= A1x(i+1, j)+A2x(i, j +1)
+Ad1x(i+1, j−d1)+Ad2x(i−d2, j +1)
(1)
where x ∈ Rn is the state vectors, A,Ad ∈ Rn×n are system
matrix with compatible dimensions. d1 and d2 are positive
integers denoting delays along vertical and horizontal di-
rections, respectively. φk(ξk(i, j)) is saturation nonlinearities
given by
φk(ξk(i, j)) =


1, ξk(i, j) > 1
ξk(i, j), −1 ≤ ξk(i, j)≤ 1
−1, ξk(i, j) <−1

 , (2)
where k = 1,2, · · · ,n. The boundary conditions are defined
by
{x(i, j) = si j, ∀ i ∈ Z and j =−d1,−d1 +1, . . . , 0},
{x(i, j) = ti j, ∀ j ∈ Z and i =−d2,−d2 +1, . . . , 0},
s00 = t00, (3)
where si j and ti j are given vectors.
B. Stability analysis
In this section, a sufficient condition for the asymptotic
stability of systems (1)-(2) is presented.

Summing up both sides of (20) from q to 0 with respect to
i and 0 to q with respect to j, one gets

It is clear that the sum of the Lyapunov functional value is
decreasing along the state trajectories. Then from [15], we
can conclude that
lim
i+ j→∞
x(i, j)→ 0 (22)
which implies that system (1)-(3) is asymptotically stable.
This completes the proof of the Theorem 1.
With Ad1 = Ad2 = 0 in (1), the system (1) is reduced to
the following system
x(i+1, j +1) = φ(ξ (i, j))
=
[ φ1(ξ1(i, j)) · · · φn(ξn(i, j)) ]T
ξ (i, j) = [ ξ1(i, j) · · · ξn(i, j) ]T
= A1x(i+1, j)+A2x(i, j +1) (23)
The saturation nonlinearities φ(·) are defined in (2). Then
we have the following Corollary.
Corollary 1: If there exist positive definite symmetric
matrices P1 ∈Rn×n, P2 ∈Rn×n, and matrix N = (ni j)∈Rn×n
such that

∑
j=1
|ni j|, i = 1,2, · · · ,n, (25)
then system (23) is asymptotically stable.
Example 1: Consider the system (1) with
A1 =
[
0.9 −2.1
0.1 0.2
]
, A2 =
[
0.1 −0.05
0.06 0.02
]
Ad1 =

−0.01 −0.1
]
, Ad2 =
[
−0.03 0
−0.01 0.1
]
.
By using the LMI Control Toolbox to solve Theorem 1 as
follows:
P1 =
[
1.5558 −3.6420
−3.6420 18.5654
]
,
P2 =
[
0.2979 0.0165

,
Q1 =
[
0.2179 −0.3014

,
Q2 =
[

]
,
N =
[
2.1548 −1.8508
−3.7856 21.7927
]
.
Therefore, according to Theorem 1, the present system is
asymptotically stable.
III. ROESSER MODEL
A. System description
Consider the 2-D state-delayed systems described by
Roesser model with saturation nonlinearities[
xh(i+1, j)
xv(i, j +1)
]
= ϕ(ϑ(i, j)) =
[
ϕh(ϑ h(i, j))
ϕv(ϑ v(i, j))
]
ϑ(i, j) =
[
ϑ h(i, j)
ϑ v(i, j)
]
= A
[
xh(i, j)
xv(i, j)
]
+Ad
[
xh(i−dh, j)
xv(i, j−dv)
]
(26)
where xh ∈ Rnh is the horizontal state vectors, xv ∈ Rnv is
the vertical state vectors, A,Ad ∈R(nh+nv)×(nh+nv) are system
matrix with compatible dimensions. dh and dv are positive
integers denoting delays along horizontal and vertical direc-
tions, respectively. The matrices
A =
[
A11 A12
A21 A22
]
, Ad =
[

, (27)
ϕhk (ϑ hk (i, j)) and ϕvl (ϑ vl (i, j)) are saturation nonlinearities
given by
ϕhk (ϑ hk (i, j)) =


1, ϑ hk (i, j) > 1

(39)
Observe that the sum of the Lyapunov functional value is
decreasing along the state trajectories. From [14], we can
conclude that
lim
i+ j→∞
x(i, j)→ 0 (40)
which implies that system (26)-(30) is asymptotically stable.
This completes the proof of the Theorem 2.
With Ad = 0 in (26), the system (26) is reduced to the
following system
[
xh(i+1, j)
xv(i, j +1)
]
= ϕ(ϑ(i, j)) =
[
ϕh(ϑ h(i, j))
ϕv(ϑ v(i, j))
]
ϑ(i, j) =
[
ϑ h(i, j)
ϑ v(i, j)
]
= A
[
xh(i, j)
xv(i, j)
]
(41)
The saturation nonlinearities ϕh(·) and ϕv(·) are defined in
(28) and (29). Then we have the following Corollary.
Corollary 2: If there exist positive definite symmetric
matrices Ph ∈ Rnh×nh , Pv ∈ Rnv×nv , and matrix M = [ni j] ∈
R
(nh+nv)×(nh+nv) such that

mkk ≥
nh+nv∑
l=1
|mkl |, k = 1,2, · · · ,(nh +nv), (43)
where P is defined in (33), then system (41) is asymptotically
stable.
Example 2: Consider the system (26) with
A =

 0.9 −0.5 .020.1 0.3 0.6
0.02 0 0.18

 ,
Ad =

 0.1 0 0.050.1 0.02 0
0.031 0.12 0

 .
where state dimensions nh = 2 and nv = 1. By using the LMI
Control Toolbox to solve Theorem 2 as follows:
P =

 253.7368 −153.6648 0−153.6648 344.7977 0
0 0 510.6340


 .
Thus, according to Theorem 2, the present system is asymp-
totically stable.
IV. CONCLUSION
This paper deals with the stability analysis for 2-D state-
delayed systems described by the Fornasini-Marchesini sec-
ond local state-space and the Roesser models under satura-
tion nonlinearities. Sufficient conditions in term of LMIs are
established. Two examples are given to illustrate the usage
of the proposed approach.
