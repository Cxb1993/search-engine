Abstract 
    In this paper, a physical model of a 3-DOF LCD glass-handling robot driven by using three 
permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) is established. The completely mathematical 
model includes two parts: the electrical equations of three PMSMs and mechanical equations of the 
system in three directions. In numerical simulations, MATLAB software is employed to solve the 
mathematical models and the real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) is used to identify the system 
parameters, which include those are not easily measured from experiments. Numerical simulations 
and experimental results are compared to show the identified parameters of the mechatronic system. 
In the adaptive control design, Lyapunov function is employed and the external loading and 
unknown disturbances are considered. Two different commands of angular-displacement curve of 
the trapezoidal and double S speed profiles are used as the tracking trajectories for comparisons. It 
is concluded that the double S speed profile has smaller tracking errors than those of the trapezoidal 
speed profile. 
Keywords:  3-DOF LCD Glass-handling robot, double S speed profile, Lyapunov function, 
permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), real-coded genetic algorithm 
(RGA).

For the motion trajectory control, Hsu et al. [5] designed the trapezoidal and double S 
trajectory profiles for the electric injection molding machine during the closing operation, and the 
effectiveness of the adaptive tracking control (ATC) was demonstrated by numerical simulations 
and experiments. Biagiotti and Melchiorri [6] developed the trajectory planning for automatic 
machines and robots. In the plant model, the system performance will be easily deteriorated by 
external disturbances, nonlinearities, and some parametric uncertainties due to unavoidable 
modeling errors, thus the adaptive control is able to eliminate these external disturbances and 
nonlinearities [7-13]. In these studies, Hu et al. [7] designed a modified version of the controller 
based on adaptive variable structure output feedback control, which satisfies the global reaching 
condition of sliding mode and adapts the unknown upper bounds of the lumped uncertainties and 
perturbations. Shanhnazi and Akbarzadeh-T [8] developed the PI-adaptive fuzzy control 
architecture for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems to provide robustness in the presence of large 
and fast but bounded uncertainties and disturbances. Chuang et al. [9] used the inertia-related 
Lyapunov function to design an adaptive controller for the motor-toggle servo mechanism. Lin et al. 
[10] formulated a robust controller with the adaptive uncertainty observer to increase the robustness 
of the motor drive system. Lee et al. [11] studied an adaptive control scheme with a pre-specified 
HN property for the tracking control of the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. 
Fung and Lin [12] based on the state-space model; the adaptive backstepping control was proposed 
to track contour trajectories. Fung et al. [13] developed the adaptive backstepping fuzzy control 
method to compensate the piezoelectric hysteresis and achieve motion tracking control. 
In this paper, we follow the mathematical modelling of the dynamic equations [1, 2], which 
include the electrical and mechanical equations, and extend the 1-DOF system [1] to the 3-DOF one 
by adding the yaw and vertical directions for real industry applications. Kinematic equations are 
used to describe the end point of the arm of the 3-DOF LCD glass-handling robot. The parameters 
are identified by the RGA method. In controller design, two tracking curves of trapezoidal and

where

the subscripts d and q represent the parameters in the d - and q -axis, and the subscript 
1,  2 and 3i = represent the parameter in PMSM1, 2 and 3, respectively. diV  and qiV  are the stator 
voltages, dii  and qii  are the stator currents, diL  and qiL  are inductances, diλ  and qiλ  are the 
stator flux linkages, siR  and siω  are the stator resistances and inverter frequencies, respectively. 
In Eqs. (3, 4), fdi I  and mdi L are the equivalent d-axis magnetizing currents and inductances, 
respectively. 
   The electromagnetic torques are 
( )p   ei mdi fdi qi di qi di qi3τ = L I i + L - L i i2 ,                     (5) 
where p  is the number of pole pairs. Equations for the motor dynamics are

where miτ , miB , riω ,  riω   and miJ are the load torques, damping coefficients, angular speeds, 
angular accelerations, moments of inertia of the rotors, respectively. In addition, the relations 
between the inverter frequencies ( siω ) and rotor angular speeds ( riω ) can be expressed as 
si riω = pω .                                  (7) 
The basic principle in controlling the PMSM drive is based on the field orientation. The flux 
position in the d-q coordinate can be determined by the shaft-position sensor because the magnetic

The electrical equations (1) for the three PMSMs and the dynamic equations (11-13) for the 
mechanical system for the 3-DOF LCD glass-handling robot can be combined into a matrix form as 
follows:  
 2 LEx(t) = Ax(t) - f(t;θ )+ Bu(t) - D ,                    (15) 
y(t) = Cx(t) ,                                (16) 
where andE, A, B,  C are the constant matrices of the system parameters and can be seen in

the errors of the angular displacements for PMSMs. 
   The fitness function (17) converges about 20 generations (not shown here) for the mechatronic 
system, and the 24 parameters are identified and shown in Table 1.  
 
Chapter 4 Motion Profile Design 
4.1 Kinematic equation 
In order to describe the kinematic equation of the 3-DOF LCD glass-handling robot, the 
position vector 3r

 of the arm 3 in Fig. 5(a) should be defined. This position vector indicates the 
end point of the robot, and is the resultant position due to three angular departments ( , 1,  2,  3i iθ = ), 
which rotate by three PMSMs.  
4.2 Trapezoidal speed profile 
A very common method [4, 5] to obtain trajectories with a continuous speed profile is to use 
linear motions with parabolic blends, and the trajectories can be characterized by the typical 
trapezoidal speed profiles. In this case, a motion is defined by assigning the initial and final time 
instants as 0t and 1t  and their conditions on displacement and speed at 0t  and 1t . From a 
mathematical point of view, the problem is then to find a function [ ]0 1, t t , t ,∈θ = θ(t)  where θ(t)  
is the profile of angular displacements such that the given conditions are satisfied. 
The trapezoidal trajectories are divided into three parts: acceleration phase, constant speed 
phase and deceleration phase. The detailed mathematical descriptions of displacements and speeds 
can be seen in [5, 6].  
4.3 Double S speed profile 
A trapezoidal speed profile presents a discontinuous acceleration. For this reason, this kind 
trajectory may generate efforts and stresses on mechanical systems and may result in detrimental or

where 3 1R ×∈p I Dd , d , d  are constant vectors. 
5.1 Adaptive controller 
The method proposed in this paper is motivated by the adaptive control, which is defined by 
the adaptive law via Lyapunov function. Let us first follow Refs. [9-13] and consider the first-order 
liner time-invariant plant as shown in Eq. (34). 
We design the adaptive controller as follows: 
1 2 3u(t) = u (t)+ u (t)+ u (t) ,                        (25) 
where 1u (t)  is used to control the system state, 2u (t)  is used to eliminate the nonlinear part of 
PMSM2 and 3u (t)  is used to eliminate the external loading and unknown disturbance.  
The controllers are defined as follows: 
ˆ 

1 α iu (t) = -b I α z(t) + b G (λ e + ω ) ,                 (26)

Chapter 6 Numerical Simulations and Experimental Results 
6.1 Numerical simulations  
In numerical simulations, Runge–Kutta method [1] with tolerance error 610− is employed to 
simulate the variations of angular displacements 1 2 3 ,  ,  and θ θ θ . In order to design the controller we 
use the RGA to identify system parameters as shown in Table 1. Substituting the assigned and 
identified parameters into dynamic equations (15, 16), and simulating by MATLAB software, we 
obtain the compared numerical simulations (not shown here). It is found that the response errors are 
below ± 0.5 %, ± 1.5 %, and ± 1.0 % for PMSM1, PMSM2 and PMSM3, respectively. It is 
validated that the RGA method is feasible for parameter identification of the 3-DOF LCD 
glass-handling robot. 
By using these identified parameters as shown in Table 1, we are able to obtain the dynamic 
responses by numerical simulations. The comparisons between the experimental and identified 
results of the angular displacements are shown in Fig. 2. The input voltage as shown in Fig. 2(a) is 
0.25sin 0.5 0.05sin 5t t+  with two different frequencies to drive the PMSMs. For the PMSM drive, 
we set dii =0, 1,  2 ,  3i =  thus the d-axis flux linkages diλ , 1,  2 ,  3i = are fixed, the rotor flux is 
produced in the d-axis only and the current vector is generated in the q-axis for the field-oriented 
control.  
In numerical simulations of the proposed adaptive controllers, Runge–Kutta method [1] with 
tolerance error 610− is also employed by MATLAB software. From Eq. (25), it is known that the 
adaptive control needs 17 gain values of [ ]ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ11 12 13= α α αTα , [ ]1 2 3= diag h h hh ,

PMSM 2 rotating the three arms and the position vector 3r

moves in the X axis. There are eight 
steps included in Fig. 5(a). The second and third ones of Fig. 5(b) are for the PMSMs rotating in the 
yaw direction and translating in the vertical direction, respectively. 
6.3 Comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental results 
In order for comparisons, the results are performed for two working cycles, and each cycle 
takes 9 sec. In numerical simulations, Figure 6 shows the external loading and unknown 
disturbances added to the system. Figure 6(a) shows the external loading resulting in the jumping 
for the PMSM1 and PMSM2. Figure 6(b) shows the affection of external loading in the step of the 
PMSM3. Two examples of jumping torques are shown in the PMSM1 and PMSM2, but their time 
durations are very shorter than PMSM3.  
Figure 7 shows the comparison results of numerical simulations between the trapezoidal and 
double S speed profiles. Figures 7(a-c) shows the control voltages of the three PMSMs, and it is 
seen that the trapezoidal speed profile has more jumping phenomenon than that of the double S 
speed profile. Figures 7(d-f) show the angular displacements of the three PMSMs, and Figures 7(g-i) 
show their angular speeds. In these figures it is seen that the designed controller can be used to 
control the robot system, and the response results of 1 θ , 2θ  and 3θ  are well in agreement with the 
commends in the first working cycle, and they are well convergent in second working cycle. 
Moreover, Figure 8 shows the comparison of response errors between the trapezoidal and double S 
speed profiles. Figures 8(a-c) show the angular-displacement errors of the three PMSMs, and it is 
seen that the double S speed profile is more suitable than the trapezoidal speed profile. Figures 8(d-f) 
show the angular-speed errors of the PMSMs, while Figures 8(g-i) show the position error s in the 
x-, y- and z- axis for the Arm3.  
Figures 9(a-o) show comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental results of 
the proposed adaptive controller in controlling the 3-DOF LCD glass-handling robot system. In this 
case, external loading and unknown disturbance are not considered in the numerical simulations,
