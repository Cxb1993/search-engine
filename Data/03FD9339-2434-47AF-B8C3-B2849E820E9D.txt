paper is to set up an oblique cutting stainless steel model to study three-dimensional cutting temperature for a sharp tool 
with a chamfered main cutting edge.  
 
2.   Theoretical Analysis 
For the past 50 years, metal cutting researchers have developed many modeling techniques including analytical 
techniques, slip line solutions, empirical approaches and finite element techniques.  In recent years, the finite element 
method has particularly become the main tool for simulating metal cutting processes [9].   Finite element models are 
widely used for calculating the stress, strain, strain rate, and temperature distributions in the primary, secondary, and 
tertiary sub-cutting zones.  FEM simulation is found to be useful to study the cutting process and chip formation.   However, 
a recent application of using an infrared sensor to measure the temperature of the machined surface during cutting has been 
published [10].  The aim of this paper is to clarify the metal cutting temperature with the chamfered main cutting edge 
sharp tool of three-dimensional deformation.  A coupled model with FEM and inverse method of thermo-elastic-plastic 
material under large deformation for oblique cutting is presented. 
                    A three dimensional cutting model with a single-point tool is the simplest case including main and front cutting edges.  
The simplest case including these two factors is shown in Fig 1.  According to Chang and Fuh [8], a force model for turning 
of stainless steel with a chamfered main cutting edge, which can accurately predict the formations of shear planes for the 
case of chamfered main cutting edge, must have nose radius R, cutting depthd , feed rate f , cutting speed V , and parallel 
back rake angle αb , SC  is the side cutting edge angle, Ce  is the end cutting edge angle, 1Sα  is the first side rake angle, and 
2Sα  is the second side rake angle. 1Sα  and αS 2  are used as shown in Table 1.

(i) The shear areas in the cutting process for sharp tool 
       The calculations of shear area A  and projected area Q  fall into one of the following equations (1-4) and equations 
(5-7).  The shear plane area A  includes the area of the triangle 1A , trapezoid area of 2A , and secondary chip's SA , Fig. 1   
6 
According to this equation, the shear plane can be verified by changing cη over a small number of values cη∆ , and 
       1 2sin sin (sin cos cos sin sin )e S b c c bα α α η η α−= +                                                                                                               (15)  
where the symbol eα represents the effective rake angle (rad), bα  denotes the back rake angle (rad), eϕ  is the 
effective shear angle and equals 0.581 1.139eα − (rad), β  is the friction angle (rad) which equals exp (0.848 0.416)eα −  [5], 
Sτ  is the shear stress which equals 2571 19.9 ( / )e MN mα−  [8], and SC  is the chip flow angle which is determined by 
minimizing the total cutting energy U . 
If the Brinell hardness of the workpiece, HB , is given, the expression of yσ  and yτ , is given by Cook [12] 
/ 2s yτ σ= , /y HBσ π=   
The constitution of the shear plane area, A, and the friction area, Q, is plotted in Fig. 1, and they will be obtained from 
the following equations:

and HF  is the cutting force, and V is the cutting speed. Therefore,

In equation (19) ( )t HR  is the horizontal cutting force in the horizontal plane and TN  is the normal force at the tip 
surface with minimum energy.  Therefore, transverse cutting force,
 T
F , and vertical cutting force, VF , can be expressed by

 Based on the cutting data, the friction force and friction heat generation can be solved. A heat partion factor is 
required to find the amount of heat transferred to the tip for thermal finite element analysis.  This heat partion between the 
tip and chip is recognized as a difficult parameter to determine.   The inverse heat transfer method is developed in this study 
to overcome this problem. 
(iii) Carbide tip’s solid modeling 
The chamfered main cutting edge tool has more special geometry.  To develop a 3D finite element mesh for thermal 
analysis, the solid model of the tip can be established in two steps.  First, CAD software, SolidWorksTM, was used to 
generate the tip body.  Then the tip’s main cutting edge was simulated to remove unwanted material and create the solid 
model of turning tip geometry, as shown in Fig. 3(a). 
(iv) Finite element thermal model 
       The carbide tip’s solid model is exported to AbaqusTM, the finite element analysis software used in this study. For 
mesh generation, Fig. 3(b) shows the finite mesh of the carbide tip, which is modeled by 58,000 four-node tetrahedral 
elements.  As shown in the top view of Fig. 3(b), 8*6 nodes are located on the projected contact length between the tool and 
the workpiece, 3 * 6 nodes are located on chamfered width of main cutting edge, and 1*6 nodes are placed on flank wear.  
These should achieve reasonable resolution in the analysis of tip temperature distribution in turning.  The initial condition 
of finite element analysis has uniform temperature of 25℃ in the tip.  Because the tip does not rotate in the experiment, free 
convection boundary condition is applied for the surface of tip contact with the workpiece.

       The experimental tests are maintained at the same conditions as follows: dry cutting; cutting velocity equals to 
140-148 m/min; cutting depth equals to 1 and 2 mm; feedrate equals to 0.33 mm/rev; the tool holder is vertical to the 
workpiece; and  protrusion of tool tip from the dynamometer is 30 mm.  For each tool configuration, the workpiece is 
turned to be a length of  240 mm in the feed direction.  The data are recorded three times at different sections.  The average 
values will be taken.  The shapes of  the main and the secondary tips are observed.  Block diagrams of performance are 
drawn as shown in Fig.2.

4.     RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
4.1 The Cutting Forces 
     According to Eqs. (1)- (7), the shear area A  and projected  area Q  of cutting cross section of the tool face with a 
chamfered main cutting edge nose radius tool considering wear can be calculated.  After obtaining the values of the shear 
area A  and friction area Q , the shear energy per unit time SU  and the friction energy per unit time fU  can be calculated 
from Equations (8) to (10).  The theoretical principal component of the cutting force FH  can be obtained from Eqs. (17) 
and (18).  Then the transverse theoretical cutting force TF  and the vertical theoretical cutting force VF can be calculated 
from Eqs. (19)- (23).  The computational flow chart is illustrated in Fig. 2.  The results shown in the figures imply the 
following conclusion: 
(1) According to the investigations under a constant side cutting edge angle SC ,  Chang and Fuh [8] calculated that the 
increase of the side rake angles 1Sα  and 2Sα  results in the decrease of cutting force FH  and VF .  The reason is that the 
areas of shear and friction are decreased, and the contact length between the cutting edge of tool and the workpiece are 
decreased, whereas the effective rake angle and effective shear angle are decreased.  However, for SC  equals 20
° , an 
increase of 1Sα  and 2Sα , increased the cutting force TF . The reason was that the contact length between the cutting edge of 
tool and the workpiece were increased. 
4.2 Temperature of tips 
Inverse heat transfer utilizes the temperature measured by infrared on the surface of tip as the input to predict the heat 
flux on the chamfered main cutting edge tools.  This method determines the heat partition factor using the optimization 
method.  An infrared (IR) pyrometer system with an optical fiber was developed for measuring the temperature of a 
chamfered main cutting edge tool during turning.  Knowing the temperature of cutting tools and how this chamfered main 
cutting edge tools decrease the temperature of the tool tip surface, as indicated in the following Figures: 
(1) Based on Lin et al. [15], a finite element method with an inverse scheme and an experimental measurement using 
infrared detector was used to monitor the temperature at the tool-chip interface, and the temperature was also recorded by 
the computer.  The measured temperatures of chamfered main cutting edge tool are as shown in Fig. 6, one dimensional 
ellipsoid model used in the inverse estimation of cutting interface temperature are as shown in Fig. 6(a) [15] and the 
inverse solution of the cutting interface temperatures for new chamfered main cutting edge tool are as shown in Fig. 6(b).
