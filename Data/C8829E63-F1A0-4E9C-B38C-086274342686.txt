Abstract 
The ceramics with the composition of（Bi0.5Na0.5）0.94Ba0.06ZryTi1-yO3 (BNBZ100yT;y=0, 
0.01, 0.02, 0.04) were prepared by the solid state reaction method. The BNBZ100yT ceramics 
were sintered at 1170  for ℃ 2 h in air exhibit perovskite structure based on X-ray diffraction. The 
densities of the sintered ceramics were around 5.827~5.939 g/cm3 (relative density 97~99%). The 
temperature dependent dielectric constant of BNB6T and BNB6Z4T showed relaxor-like 
behavior, and three phases of ferroelectric, anti-ferroelectric and paraelectric exists in different 
temperature ranges. When 2 mole% and 4 mole% Zr4+ components substituted for Ti4+, the 
remanent polarization (Pr) and coercive field (Ec) of the ceramics decreased rapidly and the 
piezoelectric property disappeareed. On the basis of TEM diffraction patterns, the crystal 
structure of BNB6Z4T was cubic phase leading to the disappearance of piezoelectric properties. 
 
Introduction 
Lead-containing ferroelectrics materials such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (abbreviated PZT) and 
PZT-based1,2 multicomponent ceramics have been widely used as sensors, actuators and 
ultrasonic transducers in various electronic devices because of their excellent piezoelectric 
properties. However, PbO vaporization during the sintering process and waste of products 
containing Pb cause a crucial environmental pollution. Recently, more and more attention has 
been paid to the investigation of leas-free piezoelectric materials to replace the lead-containing 
ferroelectrics3. 
(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3 ceramics (abbreviated BNT)4 with a rhombohedral perovskite structure have 
been considered to be a good candidate for lead-free piezoelectric ceramics because of their good 
ferroelectric properties at room temperature, high Curie temperature Tc=320℃, relatively larger 
remanent polarization of Pr=38µC/cm2 and a coercive field of Ec=73kV/cm at room temperature5. 
However, the high conductivity of pure BNT ceramics cause difficulty in the poling process. 
Furthermore, the piezoelectrics properties of BNT ceramics are too low for practical use. In order 
to improve the poling process and the electrical properties, some modification or doping of the 
BNT system has been carried out. It has been reported that BNT based compositions modified 
with BaTiO36, BiFeO37, NaNbO38, Ba(Cu0.5W0.5)O39,CeO29, MnO210, showed improved 
piezoelectrics properties and were easier to be poled compared with pure BNT ceramics. Among 
them, (Bi0.5Na0.5)1-xBaxTiO3(abbreviated BNB100xT) is more interesting because there is a 
rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundary(MPB) existed for the compositions 
between 6-7% BaTiO3. It has been reported that (Bi0.5Na0.5)0.94Ba0.06TiO3(abbreviated BNB6T) 
has relatively larger piezoelectric properties.  
In this work, we add ZrO2 into BNBT ceramics to enhance the piezoelectric properties. The 
effect of ZrO2 addition on the electrical properties, phase transition and microstructure of the 
BNB6T ceramics are examined. The dielectric properties of the samples are also measured as a 
function of temperature. 
 
Experimtal 
The conventional mixed oxide technique was used to prepare the different ZrO2 containing 
ceramics, BNB6Z100xT (x=0,0.01,0.02,0.04). Commercially available chemicals of Bi2O3, 
Na2CO3, BaCO3, ZrO2 andTiO2 with purities higher than 99.0% were used as the starting

The SEM microstructures of the sintered ceramics of BNT, BNB6T, BNB6Z1T, BNB6Z2T 
and BNB6Z4T are shown in Fig.2 indicating that all these samples are very dense. Based on the 
measurement of Archimeds method, the relative densities of BNT, BNB6T, BNB6Z1T, 
BNB6Z2T and BNB6Z4T are above 97%. It is also indicated that the grain sizes of BNBT based 
ceramics were decrease with increasing  ZrO2 content. The grain size are 12µm, 4.2µm, 2.6µm, 
2.8µm and 3.4µm  for BNT, BNB6T, BNB6Z1T, BNB6Z2T and BNB6Z4T, respectively, 
according to intercept method. Therefore, the ZrO2 is grain growth inhibitor for BNB6T.

Fig 5 show the P-E hysteresis loops of BNT-based ceramics with different ZrO2 content at 
room temperature. It reveals that both the remanent polarization(Pr) and the coercive field(Ec) 
decrease with increasing ZrO2 in BNT-based ceramics. When 2 mole% Zr4+ substitutes for Ti4+ , 
the Pr from 31.9 µC/cm2 sudden decreases to 9.5 µC/cm2 and the Ec from 21.23kV/cm decreases 
to 11.9kV/cm. The P-E hysteresis loops of BNB6Z2T and BNB6Z4T have small Pr and Ec values, 
which are close to paraelectric properties.

Fig.6 show response-anti-respone frequency and phase angle of BNT-based ceramics with 
different ZrO2 content at room temperature. It reveals that both BNB6Z2T and BNB6Z4T 
ceramics didn’t have any response-anti-respone frequency and phase angle in the same frequency 
range.  
Conclusions 
    The crystalline phase, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of BNB6Z100xT 
(x=0,0.01,0.02,0.04) ceramics were investigated in this study. When 2mole% Zr4+ substitutes for 
Ti4+ it leads to phase transition, and a decrease in grain size. The temperature dependent dielectric 
constant of BNB6T and BNB6Z4T show relaxor-like behavior, and three phases of ferroelectric, 
anti-ferroelectric and paraelectric sites exists in different temperature ranges. When used 2mole% 
Zr4+ substitutes for Ti4+, the Pr and Ec decrease rapidly.  From the results of TEM diffraction 
patterns, BNB6Z4T ceramic is cubic phase and its piezoelectrics properties disappear due to the 
existence of Zr4+.
