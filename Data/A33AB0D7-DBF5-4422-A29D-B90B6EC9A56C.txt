ABSTRACT -  In this project, we propose equalizer design methods for the problem of  a  robust 
mean-square-error (MSE) equalizer design for wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) 
communication systems subject to channel matrix uncertainties. As we show, the optimal minimax 
MSE equalizer can be formulated as a solution to a semidefinite programming problem (SDP). In 
addition, we derive a suboptimal solution for the problem, which may save computational cost as 
well as have comparable MSE performance, since the amount of computations in the SDP may 
grow rapidly as the MIMO dimension increases.  We further partition the MIMO channel 
uncertainty range into finite Markov-transitioned channel uncertain states. On this basis, a feasible 
equalizer can be obtained from a weighted combination of either multiple quasi-optimal minimax 
MSE equalizers or multiple quasi-suboptimal minimax MSE equalizers, each of which is designed 
with respect to a channel uncertain state.  Simulation results show that a weighted combination of a 
moderate number of quasi-suboptimal minimax MSE equalizers can achieve robust equalization 
with satisfactory MSE performance as well as with superior bit-error-rate  performance.

[10], we adopt the minimax approach. Our objective is to find the equalizer minimizing the MSE of 
the error symbol vectors under the worst channel uncertainty. The equalization problem 
formulation herein is different from that in [10].   
The contribution of this paper is that we present three types of solutions which may achieve 
similarly superior MSE performance to the targeted problem. Moreover, we demonstrate that among 
those three solutions, a weighted combination of minimax mse equalizers can yield better BER 
performance.     First, we show that the optimal minimax MSE equalizer for the targeted problem 
can be formulated as a solution to a semidefinite programming problem (SDP). Though a SDP is 
efficiently solvable [11]-[12], the amount of computations may grow rapidly as the MIMO 
dimension increases. Next, to improve computational efficiency, we derive a suboptimal solution 
based on the application of the minimax scheme to a modified MSE cost function of the targeted 
problem. In general, the worst channel uncertainty for a moving mobile station (MS) is dominated 
by the highest allowable speed of the MS.  For a robust design adopting the worst channel 
uncertainty, the resultant equalizer may perform quite conservatively when an MS is at rest or 
slowly roaming.  To overcome  the  shortcoming,  
we partition the overall channel uncertainty range into some channel uncertain states whose state 
transitions are characterized by a Markov process akin to that in [13]-[14]. As a result, we  obtain 
multiple optimal MSE equalizers or multiple suboptimal equalizers, each of which is designed with 
respect to a channel uncertain state. On this basis, a feasible equalizer can be derived from a 
weighted combination of either multiple optimal equalizers or multiple suboptimal equalizers.  The 
performance of each equalizer proposed herein is evaluated. Simulations show that an equalizer 
obtained from a weighted combination of a moderate number of suboptimal equalizers can yield

an equalizer design has to incorporate the time-varying behavior of channel uncertainties. In this 
regard, it seems more plausible to partition the overall channel uncertainty range into M  distinct 
channel uncertain states whose state transitions follow an Markov process where for each state i ,

intermediate uncertain states in order to reach uncertain states m . Assume the distance between any 
two neighboring channel uncertain states is equally distanced. Thus, the channel uncertainty matrix 
 at the i th channel uncertain state forms a ball centering at the zero matrix with radius , i.e.,

centralized/partially decentralized control plays a key role in the emerging wireless distributed 
network as well as some solutions.  I also attended two interesting keynote speeches. One is about 
the Emerging Wireless Technologies and the Future Internet. The other is about Radio Technical 
Innovation and Spectrum Policy. Both speeches were delivered in a fairly knowledgeable and 
entertaining fashion. In addition, I attended several presentation sessions related to the applications 
of game theory to communication systems and had some discussions with several authors.  The 
PIMRC’09 was well organized and well attended.  
二、 與會心得 
It is important to attend conferences in which I can interact and discuss with other authors interested 
in my work and ideas. I think I achieved the foregoing goal in the PIMRC’09. Many researchers are 
working very actively in the areas of communications---particularly, wireless communications. 
Researchers in the field of communications should actively disseminate their results in the PIMRC 
and other premium communication conferences. I would like to thank the National Science Council 
of Taiwan for partial financial support so that I can attend the IEEE PIMRC’09 held in Tokyo. To 
interact with international researchers in a conference is nice.     
we partition the overall channel uncertainty range into some 
channel uncertain states whose state transitions are characterized 
by a Markov process akin to that in [13]-[14]. As a result, we  
obtain multiple optimal MSE equalizers or multiple suboptimal 
equalizers, each of which is designed with respect to a channel 
uncertain state. On this basis, a feasible equalizer can be derived 
from a weighted combination of either multiple optimal 
equalizers or multiple suboptimal equalizers.  The performance 
of each equalizer proposed herein is evaluated. Simulations show 
that an equalizer obtained from a weighted combination of a 
moderate number of suboptimal equalizers can yield superior 
BER performance with great speed and maintain satisfactory 
MSE performance.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The 
system model is given in Section II. In Section III, the problem is 
formulated and various solutions to the targeted problem are 
provided. Simulation results are presented in Section IV. Finally, 
a summary is given in Section V.

II. SYSTEM   MODEL 
We consider an MIMO flat-fading channel with tN  inputs 
and rN  outputs, which is characterized by the following 
measurement equation 
          )()()()( kkkk nGxHy +=                                                 (1) 
where 1)( ×∈ rNCky  is the received vector; 1)( ×∈ tNCkx ; 
tt NNC ×∈G  is  a fixed and known precoder matrix; 
tNrNCk ×∈)(H  is the channel gain matrix at time step k ,  
1)( ×∈ rNCkn  is the additive noise at the receiving end.  
Without loss of generality, we assume that the transmitted 
symbol vector )(kx  is zero-mean and spatially white with unit 
variance; moreover, )(kx and )(kn are statistically independent. 
Therefore,  the covariance matrices are

where )(kF  is the equalizer.  
 
III. ROBUST   EQUALIZER  DESIGN  
We are concerned with how to design a linear equalizer 
)(kF  based on the received signal vector )(ky  and a given 
precoder matrix G  satisfying the constraint (3) for robustly 
estimating the transmitted symbol vector )(kx  under channel 
uncertainties. We assume that for each time step k , the nominal 
channel gain matrix )(ˆ kH  is known, and may not equal the real 
channel gain matrix )(kH . We define the channel uncertainty 
matrix )(kΔH  as     
    )(ˆ)()( kkk HHH −=Δ                                                   (5)             
Then the channel gain uncertainty matrix )(kΔH  forms a ball 
centering at  the zero  matrix  with  radius )(kr , i.e.,

 Channel uncertainty of a quasi-static channel can only 
reside at a channel uncertain state j  for most of the time. Hence, 
more weighting is likely to be given to the thj equalizer )(kjF  
according to (23). Accordingly, for a quasi-static channel, the 
equalization performance loss is negligible using a combined 
equalizer based on M -state ( 1>M ) Markov-transitioned 
channel uncertainty bounds in comparison with using )(kjF  
only.  
IV.  NUMERICAL  EXAMPLE  
Suppose a mobile communication system operates with a 
carrier frequency 1.8GHz. The system should support various 
data bit rates and large transmission ranges. Thus the 
transmission rate of 40kb/s is used even though it is very slow 
for MIMO wireless communications. We consider a 2-input-4-
output flat-fading channel and a precoder of the direct 
transmission scheme (i.e.,  tNtN
p
IG 0= )  with the power 
constraint 10 =p . The symbol vector in eq. (1) is generated 
using an uncoded quadrature amplitude modulation strategy 
with 2 bits per symbol.  For each fixed  input  signal-to-noise

We consider the actual channel gain matrices )(kH  due to  
time-varying relative velocities of  the mobile station (MS) 
which take place in the following order: 20, 40,  60, 80, 110 
( hr
km ).  For each given velocity, 1200 symbols are sent as the 
information data.  The actual channel gain matrices are 
generated by the Jakes' model.  The corresponding nominal 
channel gain matrices )(ˆ kH  are obtained using the sample-and-
hold actions. The actual channel gain matrices  are sampled  
every  12 time steps and the sampled results are hold constant 
for 11 time steps. For simplicity, channel uncertainties are 
partitioned into three states based on the highest relative velocity 
of the MS, i.e., 110 hr
km .  So,  the radius of each channel 
uncertain state region is obtained as follows: 05.01 =r , 
4.02 =r and  8.03 =r .  The transition probability matrix ][ ijp  
of the channel states is given as

The SDP is solved using the well-developed LMI toolbox  in [12] 
in the MATLAB environment.  All performance curves in  Figs. 
1 and  2 are the average results of 200 Monte Carlo simulation 
runs.  In Figs. 1-2, the conventional MMSE equalizer is marked 
as ‘mmse’. Both equalizers (marked as ‘quasi-opt minimax 
MSE’ and ‘quasi-subopt minimax MSE’) are obtained from the 
optimal minimax MSE and the suboptimal minimax MSE 
equalizers (marked as ‘opt minimax MSE’ and ‘subopt minimax 
MSE’ respectively) with time-varying channel uncertainty 
bound replaced by 8.03 =r . The combined quasi-optimal 
minimax MSE equalizer (marked as combined quasi-opt 
minimax MSE) is obtained from the weighted combination of 
three optimal minimax MSE equalizers, each of whose time-
varying channel bounds is replaced by 05.01 =r , 4.02 =r and  
8.03 =r . The combined quasi-subopt  minimax MSE equalizer 
(marked as ‘quasi-subopt minimax MSE’) is obtained in a 
similar fashion.  
       Fig.1 show that the MSE performance of the ‘mmse’ is 
superior to both the ‘quasi-opt minimax mse’ and the ‘quasi-
subopt minimax mse’, which were developed quite 
conservatively.   The ‘opt minimax mse’, the ‘subopt minimax 
mse’, the ‘combined quasi-opt minimax mse’  and the 
‘combined quasi-subopt minimax mse’ perform similarly; 
meanwhile they  perform better than the ‘mmse’.   
       Fig. 2  show that the ‘opt minimax mse’ and  the ‘mmse’ 
have a similar BER performance.  The ‘subopt minimax mse’, 
the ‘combined quasi-subopt minimax mse’ and the ‘combined 
quasi-opt minimax mse’  have a similar performance and  
outperform the ‘mmse’; however, only the combined minimax 
equalizers are feasible in practice.   
Though the combined minimax equalizers have superior 
MSE and BER performance consistently, the ‘combined quasi-
subopt minimax MSE’ is far more efficient than the ‘combined 
quasi-opt minimax MSE’.  This together with the results of Figs. 
1-2 indicate that the ‘combined quasi-subopt minimax mse’ is a 
viable choice for robust MIMO equalization.
