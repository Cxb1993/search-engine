representations to control the PAPR, such as 
selective mapping (SLM)[3],[4],[5] and 
partial transmit sequences (PTS) [6],[7],[8]. 
The  PTS and SLM are probabilistic methods 
which improve the PAPR statistics 
significantly with only a small data rate loss.

  The conventional PTS technique divides 
the input data block into disjoint sub-blocks 
of the same length as input block. Then 
partial transmit sequences are formed by 
taking the Fourier transform of these 
sub-blocks, and a number of OFDM 
candidates are generated by linear 
combination of these PTS with different 
weighting factors. The one with the minimum 
PAPR is selected for transmission to represent 
the input block. A recent study investigates a 
modified PTS by applying non-uniform phase 
factors [9], which achieves good PAPR 
reduction than the the conventional PTS with 
uniform phase factors. 
 
  In this paper, we propose a modified PTS 
algorithm for PAPR reduction of M-QAM 
OFDM signals by partitioning an M-QAM 
OFDM block into non-disjoint OFDM 
sub-blocks. The principle of this algorithm is 
to employ different disjoint partitions on the 
QPSK or BPSK OFDM blocks, which result 
in an equivalent non-disjoint partition on this 
M-QAM OFDM block. Simulation results 
show that the modified PTS with a 
non-disjoint partition outperforms the 
conventional PTS in PAPR reduction for 
interleaved, adjacent, and random partitioning 
schemes. 
 
CONVENTIONAL DISJOINT PTS 
 
Let X  denote the input 
OFDM block from an M-QAM constellation 
in an OFDM system of N subcarriers. Each 
symbol in X modulates one of orthogonal 
sinusoidal subcarriers,
1 2( , ,..., )NX X X=
{ }2 ,1kj f te tπ ≤ ≤ N , 
where ( 1) /kf k= − T  and T  is the duration 
of an OFDM symbol. The OFDM baseband 
signal due to the data block X can be 
expressed as

Since the orthogonality holds between the 
distinct subcarrier signals, the average power 
of X, 2X , is thus equal to

collection of all possible transmitted OFDM

The continuous PAPR of x(t) is 
approximated by its discrete LN samples

from the LN-point IDFT of  
with (L-1)N zero-padding. Here, we use L=4 
for numerical simulation and it is enough to 
estimate the continuous PAPR, as is 
observed in [10].

In the conventional PTS technique, the 
input data block X of length N is partitioned

PTS, each  is chosen to be an 
uniform weight equal to N/M. There are 
in general three possible partitioning 
schemes on the OFDM block X, including 
interleaved, adjacent, and random 
partitions, shown in Fig. 1 with N=8 
and M=4.

can also write a -QAM OFDM block as 
the vector sum of m QPSK OFDM blocks or 
of 2m BPSK OFDM blocks. As follows, the 
16-QAM OFDM block as a vector sum of 
two QPSK OFDM blocks is used to 
demonstrate the modified PTS algorithm.

Let 1π  and 2π  be two partitioning 
schemes for QPSK OFDM blocks 1QX  and 
2QX  respectively, i.e.,

The block diagram of this modified PTS, 
called MPTS, is shown in Fig. 3.

Since 1π  and 2π  are two distinct 
partitions, it is very likely that there are only

iX Mi ≤≤1 . This implies that 
the weight of  in (10) is at least N/M and 
at most 2 N/M, and these M 16-QAM OFDM 
sub-blocks are no longer pairwise disjoint. 
The MPTS is equivalent to the conventional 
PTS when these two partitions are chosen to 
be the same, i.e., 
iX

the support of  and the support of

to choose 2π  as the cyclic shift of 1π  to the

and the support of these four non-disjoint 
16-QAM OFDM sub-blocks in MPTS are 
{1,2,3,4},{3,4,5,6},{5,6,7,8}, and {7,8,1,2} 
respectively, where the supports of four 
disjoint sub-blocks in conventional PTS are 
{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}, and {7,8}. Fig. 4 shows 
the adjacent partitions for the disjoint PTS and 
non-disjoint PTS. 
 
 
 
where A(t) is the amplitude of the input signal, 
 is the maximum output amplitude and p 
is the parameter, controlling the smoothness 
of SSPA. Here, we choose p=2 and assume 
that the transmission of the side information is 
perfectly received.

Let R be the output after the FFT transform 
of the received vector 
 
r=s+n, 
 
where s is the output vector from the SSPA 
and n is a complex Gaussian noise vector with 
variance . As with the conventional 
PTS, the MPTS can recover the OFDM block 
by mapping each component in R to the closet 
signal point and form the vector . We then  
decompose  into two QPSK OFDM 
blocks and form $M$ sub-blocks by (10), and  
multiply these sub-blocks by the side 
information. Fig. 8 shows the BER 
performance for the conventional PTS and 
MPTS in adjacent partitioning scheme with 
SSPA model through the AWGN channel.
