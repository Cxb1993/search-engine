 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Recently, significant investigations have 
focused on nanoparticles (NPs) such as Si, Ge, 
Au, Pt, NiSi2, W, TiN, Ni and Al2O3 NPs, to 
meet the urgent need for charge trapping 
nodes (CTNs) with nanoscale dimensions for 
advanced nonvolatile memory (NVM) device 
applications [1-9].  Self-organized Ge NPs 
embedded in hafnium aluminum oxide 
(HfAlO) fabricated by pulsed deposition 
exhibits a flatband voltage shift (∆Vfb) of 600 
mV [2].  The average size and the density of 
the NiSi2 NPs are measured to be around 7.6 
nm and 3.3 x 1011 cm-2, respectively [5].  
Well-isolated tungsten NPs with a mean 
diameter of 5 nm and a surface density of 5 x 
1011 cm-2 are also obtained by the embedding 
of tungsten NPs in HfAlO high-k dielectrics 
[6].  Thus, NPs have been extensively 
employed, superseding conventional thin 
films as CTNs in 
silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) 
devices to reduce charge loss due to a local 
leakage path [1].  Additionally, the metal 
gate and the high-dielectric-constant (high-k) 
gate oxides with identical equivalent-oxide 
thickness (EOT) are promising for reducing 
the gate tunneling leakage current in advanced 
metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) devices 
applications [10-13].  Therefore, NPs 
embedded in the high-k gate dielectric are an 
attractive technological option for NVM 
device applications [2].  However, the loss of 
trapped charges was related to the conduction 
band offset and trap energy levels [14-15].  
Since the conduction band offset (CBO) or the 
valance band offset (VBO) can be tuned using 
the alloying metal oxide as the charge 
trapping layer in SONOS devices [16], the 
characteristics of the alloying metal oxide 
nanoparticles (AMONs) are worthy of 
investigation.  In this work, reduced 
CoxMoyO, CoxFeyO and FexMoyO AMONs, 
individually embedded in hafnium oxynitride 
(HfON) high-k dielectrics were compared.  
They were formed by chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD).  
 
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
Al/HfON/AMONs/HfON (AMONs= 
CoxMoyO, CoxFeyO or FexMoyO) stack 
structures were formed on (100)-oriented 
p-type silicon substrates to fabricate MOS 
capacitors.  Prior to HfON growth, all wafers 
were cleaned by a wet cleaning process 
(APM/HPM/DHF).  The process used an 
NH4OH/H2O2/H2O mixture (APM) in a ratio 
of 1:4:20 (volume) at 75 °C and an 
HCl/H2O2/H2O mixture (HPM) in a ratio of 
1:1:6 (volume) at 75 °C to remove residues 
and contaminants.  The dipping time in all 
processes was 10 min.  Diluted HF (DHF) 
with HF and H2O in a ratio of 1:100 (volume) 
was used to remove native oxide.  Following 
the wet processes, all wafers were rinsed with 
deionized water for 10 min.  Then, Hf layers, 
with a thickness of 4.0 nm, measured by 
spectroscopic ellipsometry, were thermally 
evaporated on the cleaned wafers.  
Post-deposition annealing (PDA) using a 
furnace was then carried out at 600 ℃ in N2 
gas for 5 min to form HfOxNy.  An EOT of 
1.8 nm was extracted by comparing the 
measured data at 1 MHz with the simulated 
low-frequency capacitance-voltage (C-V) data 
[17].  Notably, some oxygen in the form of 
HfOxNy may already be present during Hf 
evaporation.  To prevent excessive oxidation 
that might cause the formation of a thick 
interfacial layer between the Si and the high-k 
dielectric, PDA was performed only in N2 
origin of the hysteresis is associated with 
charge trapping at the AMONs embedded in 
the HfOxNy dielectric bulk. 
 
 
FIG. 1.  Typical capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
hysteresis characteristics of memory devices 
for (a) HfOxNy high-k dielectric without and 
with APM/HPM treatments (b) dip-coated 
Co/Mo catalysts without and with calcination 
and reduction (C/R).  C-V sweep loops were 
performed at ±5 V. 
 
To investigate the charge trapping 
characteristics of the MOS devices due to the 
various AMONs, the C-V HSs of the MOS 
devices without and with the various AMONs 
were investigated, as presented in Fig. 3.  
The sample without AMONs exhibits no clear 
hysteresis shift between the forward (from 
inversion to accumulation) and the reverse 
(from accumulation to inversion) C-V curve, 
as shown in Fig. 3(a), indicating that the 
electrons or the holes are not easily trapped in 
the HfOxNy layer.   
 
 
FIG. 2.  (a) Typical capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
hysteresis characteristics of the memory 
devices with various weight percentages 
(wt.%) for the CoxMoyO AMONs.  The C-V 
sweep loops were performed at ±5 V.  (b) 
Flatband voltage shifts as function of the 
various sweep loops for various wt.% of 
CoxMoyO AMONs 
 
 
CoxFeyO and FexMoyO AMONs had 
diameters of ~4-20, ~10-60 and 30-80 nm and 
surface densities of ~1 x 1011, ~5 x 1010, and 
~3 x 1010 cm-2, respectively.  Devices with 
CoxMoyO AMONs had the highest surface 
density and smallest diameter.  CoO NPs 
attach to the CoMoOx AMONs boundaries 
after reduction in Ar/H2 for CoO, MoO3 and 
CoMoOx agglomeration [18].   
 
FIG. 4.  Morphology and the composition in 
various AMONs were detected by SEM and 
EDS of TEM, respectively.  Inset in figure (d) 
presents cross section of 
SiO2/PdPt/CoxMoyOz/HfON structure.  
SiO2/PdPt capping layers were used to prevent 
various AMONs from peeling off HfON 
surface.  The cross-section sample was 
prepared using focus ion beam.  SiO2/PdPt 
capping layer yielded Si, Pd and Pt peaks. 
 
In this work, larger diameter AMONs 
consist of AOx (A= Co, or Mo, or Fe) and 
AxByO (A, B=Co, or Mo, or Fe) 
agglomeration reduced in an Ar/NH3 ambient.  
According to the CTD measured at ±5 V HSs, 
the mean charge collection in the CoxMoyO, 
CoxFeyO and FexMoyO AMONs can be 
estimated to be around 11, 15 and 21 electrons 
or equivalent holes charges, respectively.  
The smaller average collected charges in each 
AMON indicate that the CoxMoyO AMONs 
have good charge retention because little 
charge loss associated with a local leakage 
path.  Additionally, the EDS results obtained 
using a TEM instrument show that the 
compositions in the various AMONs are 
around Co0.40Mo0.45O0.15, Co0.5Fe0.2O0.3 and 
Fe0.1Mo0.6O0.3. 
 
FIG. 5. (a) Charge retention properties of the 
MOS devices with various AMONs using the 
programming voltages (PVs) of ±5 V and 
programming times (PTs) of 1s performed at 
room temperature.  When a +5 V bias was 
applied to the control gate, electrons directly 
tunneled from the Si substrate through the 
HfON tunnel oxide, to be trapped in the 
various AMONs.  When a -5 V bias was 
applied to the control gate, holes were injected 
into the various AMONs or the electrons 
erased back to the Si substrate. (b) Memory 
windows as a function of PVs in various 
AMONs. 
indicating that the electrons are not easily 
trapped into the various AMONs as shown in 
Fig. 7(a).  In contrast, as the PTs increase, a 
clear shift (~500 mV) to the left is observed 
for a PV of -5 V, suggesting that the holes are 
much more easily trapped in the various 
AMONs.  The hole trapping mechanism is 
consistent with the results presented in Fig. 3.  
Furthermore, a comparison to CoxFeyO and 
FexMoyO AMONs indicates that the device 
with the CoxMoyO AMONs has better 
programming characteristic as presented in 
Fig. 7(b).  Thus, the embedding of CoxMoyO 
AMONs in the HfON high-k dielectric as the 
CTNs of the memory devices based on the 
holes trapping mechanism has potential for the 
advanced NVM devices applications.

MOS devices with CoxMoyOz AMONs under 
various PTs and PVs of ±5 V.  (b) Flatband 
voltage as function of PTs for MOS devices

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
CoxMoyO, CoxFeyO and FexMoyO 
alloying metal oxide nanoparticles (AMONs) 
individually embedded in HfON high-k 
dielectric were compared.  They were 
formed by calcining and reducing Co/Mo, 
Co/Fe and Fe/Mo acetate in Ar/NH3 ambient, 
respectively.  HfOxNy high-k dielectric 
without APM/HPM treatment, dip-coated 
Co/Mo catalysts with calcinations and 
reduction, as well as Co/Mo, Co/Fe and 
Fe/Mo acetate using the 0.01:0.01 wt.% were 
used to prepare CoxMoyO, CoxFeyO and 
FexMoyO AMONs.  The results show that the 
larger charge trap states density, the larger 
memory window and the better programming 
characteristics are associated with the higher 
surface density and the smaller diameter in 
device with CoxMoyO AMONs.  The smaller 
average collected charge in each AMON 
indicates that the CoxMoyO AMONs has good 
charge retention because relatively little 
charge loss is associated with a local leakage 
path.  The measurements of programming 
characteristics demonstrate that the memory 
effects are mainly related to the trapping of 
holes.

2. EXPERIMENTS 
   Fig. 1 displays a schematic device structure of the silicon nanorods (SNRs) solar cells with 
an area of 3 cm2. The SNRs (diameter ~100-200 nm, length ~1-2 µm) were formed on the 
Au/polycrystalline (pc)-Si/p-Si(100) stack structures with an Au catalyst thickness of 10 nm as 
shown in Fig. 2. The growth conditions were carried out at 620 oC in SiH4 of 100 sccm 
ambient and with a partial pressure of 350 mtorr for 5 min [3]. Then, the SNR/pc-Si/p-Si(100) 
and the pc-Si/p-Si(100) structures were formed by phosphorus diffusion at 950 oC for 4 hrs, 
respectively, resulting in an emitter with a depth of around 70 nm. Finally, the front and rear Al 
contacts were formed by sputtering. To investigate the effects of the SNR on the reflectance 
characteristics, the SNR formed on the Au/pc-Si/SiO2/Si(100) substrate were performed by the 
reflectance spectra. The reflectance spectra confirm that the reflections of the SNR with 
crisscrossed microstructure was lower than <1% for the wavelength range of 200–1100 nm as 
shown in Fig. 3. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the reflectance spectra of the pc-Si/p-Si(100) 
structure. It can be seen that the larger reflections in the pc-Si/p-Si(100) substrate were 
detected. Therefore, the reflection can be dramatically reduced by the SNR. A conversion 
efficiency of around 1.34 % with a 4.75 mA/cm2 photocurrent, open circuit voltage of 400 mV, 
and fill factor of 70.37 %, for SNR solar cells were obtained as shown in Fig. 4(a). Compare to 
the planar n+-pc-Si/pc-Si/p-Si(100) structure solar cell as shown in Fig 4(b), the SNR solar cell 
has an conversion efficiency improvement of 34 %. External quantum efficiency of the SNR 
solar cell was measured with a maximum value of 7 % at 750 nm as shown Fig. 5.   
3. SUMMARY 
A silicon nanorod solar cell fabricated with vapor–liquid–solid reaction using gold as the 
mediating catalyst and silane as the Si source ambient was demonstrated. The reflections (<1 
%) of the SNR were much lower than planar cells for the wavelength range of 200–1100 nm. A 
conversion efficiency of around 1.34 % and external quantum efficiency of ~7 % at 750 nm 
were obtained. Experimental results indicate that silicon nanorod solar cell is a promising 
candidate for integration with nanoelectronic devices.
