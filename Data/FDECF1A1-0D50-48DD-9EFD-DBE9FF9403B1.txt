Abstract—On-demand printing has recently become a 
competitive worldwide industry. For high-speed on-demand 
printing, electrophotography or xerography is the technology 
of choice. From the perspectives of fundamental science or 
engineering application, there are still lots of research subjects 
to be explored and problems waited to be solved. This project 
will conduct application-oriented research for a class of 
electrophotographic printing systems, focusing on topics 
relevant to spatial image rendition. Accurate spatial image 
rendition is one of the three fundamental problems which will 
be encountered when performing process level control of print 
quality. To achieve accurate spatial image rendition, we 
propose the following three research subjects: 1) Determine a 
suitable model structure to describe the spatial response 
function (SRF); 2) Develop methods to identify the SRF from 
test images; 3) Incorporate the identified model into image path 
to improve imaging performance. The proposed research will 
significantly improve the spatial image quality of 
electrophotographic printers and also help industry upgrade 
existing design and development techniques. The proposed 
control strategy and design methodology are not limited to 
electrophotographic product. Similar techniques, such as 
system identification, control algorithm, and halftoning 
algorithm, can be modified and extended to inkjet systems and 
many other image capturing systems. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
LECTROPHOTOGRAPHY was first incorporated 
into a commercial product in 1959. At that time Xerox 
Corporation launched the sale of their first automatic copier 
machine (known as Xerox 915). In recent years, electronic 
document quickly gained popularity and made people 
predict that the market of printing products will gradually 
decline. Emergence of electronic document defines a new 
form of portable document, and also changes people’s 
reading habits. Many publishers or vendors now provide

where “FFT Mag of Test Image (ω )” is the FFT magnitude 
extracted from the test image, and “FFT Mag of Printed 
Image ( ω )” is the FFT magnitude of the printed and 
scanned image. The gamma correction curve of the scanner 
(See Figure 2) is used as “Scanner MTF” under a common 
practical assumption the scanner has much larger bandwidth 
than the printer does for all operating points. 
A. Determination of the MTF in Print Direction 
For the following two experiments, we consider only the 
MTF of the printer in the print direction. 
1) Using Test Image with Edge Rise Pattern 
The experimental procedure is split into five steps: 
Step 1 Create a grayscale test image (see Figure 3(a)) and 
obtain a binary image (see Figure 3(b)) using typical 
halftone algorithm, i.e., error diffusion. 
Step 2 Print the binary image using the experimental 
platform under a resolution of 600 dpi. Scan the printed 
image using a calibrated scanner under a resolution of 3000 
dpi (Figure 4(a)). 
Step 3 Obtain the ESF’s of the binary and printed images by 
averaging the images across the scan direction. A low pass 
differentiator (LPD) is applied to the ESF’s and produces the 
LSF’s (Figure 3(c) and Figure 4(b)).  
Step 4 Calculate and plot the FFT’s of the LSF’s (Figure 3(d) 
and Figure 4(c)). 
Step 5 Calculate and plot the MTF according to (1). 
A LPD [13][14] is implemented to reduce the effect of the 
noise when taking derivative, which has a desired frequency

where cω  is cutoff frequency. For this experiment, the 
cutoff frequency and the order of the LPD are set to 300 
cycles/inch and 95, respectively. Effect of the LPD on the 
MTF is explored in details and omitted for brevity. The 
MTF’s for four different operating points (or background 
grayscale levels) are provided in Figure 5. Note that edge 
visibility and uniformity of the printed image will greatly 
affect the results. As shown in Figure 4(a), the printed image 
of the experimental platform definitely has poor uniformity. 
2) Using Test Image with Square Wave Pattern 
The experimental procedure is split into five steps: 
Step 1 Two approaches may be considered to create a test 
image. One is to generate a grayscale image and then obtain 
the corresponding binary image using error diffusion 
(top-left image in Figure 6). The other is to create a binary 
image directly using pre-specified halftone patterns 
(top-middle image in Figure 6). 
Step 2 Perform FFT of the binary image (top-right plot in 
Figure 6). 
Step 3 Print the binary image using the experimental 
platform under a resolution of 600 dpi. Scan the printed 
image using a calibrated scanner under a resolution of 3000 
dpi (bottom-left and bottom-middle images in Figure 6).  
Step 4 Perform FFT of the printed and scanned image 
(bottom-right plot in Figure 6). 
Step 5 Using the two FFT plots and data, we may calculate 
and plot the MTF according to (1). 
The MTF’s corresponding to different background 
grayscale levels are provided in Figure 7. We notice of 
significantly lower MTF’s for low background tones, which 
is due to the fact that the printer has limited capability in 
rendering distinguishable gray of low intensity. For this 
experiment, we also discover that the MTF will depend on 
the image area cropped for analysis. The details are omitted 
for brevity. 
B. Determination of the MTF in Both Print and Scan 
Directions 
For the following two experiments, we consider the MTF 
of the printer in both the print and scan directions. 
1) Test Image with Edge Rise Pattern 
The experimental procedure is split into five steps: 
Step 1 Generate a grayscale image (Figure 8(a)) and obtain 
the corresponding binary image using error diffusion (Figure 
8(b)). 
Step 2 Print the binary image using the experimental 
platform under a resolution of 600 dpi. Scan the printed 
image using a calibrated scanner under a resolution of 3000 
dpi (Figure 9(a)).  
Step 3 Design a low pass filter with cutoff frequency of 150 
cycles/inch (see Figure 8(c) and Figure 9(b)) to filter out 
high frequency components of the image (Figure 8(d) and 
Figure 9(c)). A Prewitt filter (2D Differentiator) is then 
applied to obtain the ESF’s (Figure 8(e) and Figure 9(d)). 
Step 4 Perform and plot FFT of the ESF’s (Figure 8(f) and 
Figure 9(e)). 
Step 5 Calculate and plot the MTF according to (1). 
The MTF’s for three different background levels are 
provided in Figure 10. Note that halftone pattern in a binary 
image could introduce noise into the ESF after applying the 
differentiator. The effect on the MTF is explored and the 
details are omitted for brevity. Note that the cutoff frequency 
of the low pass filter also affects the obtained MTF. 
2) Using Test Image with Sinusoid Pattern 
The experimental procedure is split into five steps: 
Step 1 Produce a grayscale test image (Figure 11(a)) and 
obtain the binary image using error diffusion (Figure 11(b)). 
Step 2 Perform FFT of the binary image (see Figure 11(c)). 
The fundamental frequency component and the 
corresponding harmonics can be seen when zooming in the 
plot (see Figure 11(d)(e)(f)). 
Step 3 Print the binary image using the experimental 
platform under a resolution of 600 dpi. Scan the printed 
image using a calibrated scanner under a resolution of 3000 
dpi (see Figure 12(a)). 
Step 4 Perform FFT of the printed and scanned image (see 
Figure 12(b)). The fundamental frequency component and

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new design of spatial-based repetitive control for rotational motion 
systems required to operate at varying speeds and subject to spatially periodic disturbances. The system 
has known model structure with uncertain parameters. To synthesize a repetitive controller in spatial 
domain, a linear time-invariant system is reformulated with respect to a spatial coordinate (e.g., angular 
displacement), which results in a nonlinear system. A nonlinear state observer is then established for the 
system. Adaptive feedback linearization is applied to the system with the state observer so as to minimize 
the tacking error. Moreover, a spatial-based repetitive controller is added and operates in parallel with the 
adaptively feedback linearized system, which not only further reduces the tracking error but also improves 
parameter adaptation. The overall output feedback adaptive feedback linearization repetitive control 
system is robust to structured parameter uncertainty, capable of rejecting spatially periodic disturbances 
under varying process speeds, and can be proved to be stable and produce bounded tracking error. Finally, 
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Rotational motion systems have found their application in 
many industry products. For most application, the systems 
are required to operate at varying speeds while following 
repetitive trajectories and/or rejecting disturbances with 
sinusoidal/periodic components. For example, the brushless 
dc motor in a typical laser printer may need to operate at 
different speed when driving the photosensitive drum for 
printing tasks of different media or resolution. Also, laser 
printing systems often suffer from a type of print artifacts 
(known as banding), which is mostly due to periodic 
disturbances affecting the angular velocity of the 
photosensitive drum (see e.g., Chen et al., 2003). Repetitive 
control systems have been shown to work well for tracking 
periodic reference commands or for rejecting periodic 
disturbances in regulation applications. Typical repetitive 
controllers are time-based controllers since they are 
synthesized and operate in temporal or time domain. For 
example, to synthesize the repetitive controller proposed by 
Hara et al. (1988), one of the key steps is to determine the 
temporal period or frequency of the tracking or disturbance 
signal. To ensure effectiveness of the design, an underlying 
assumption is that the tracking or disturbance signal is 
stationary, i.e., the frequency/period of the tracking or 
disturbance signal does not vary with time. This assumption 
can easily be satisfied for many cases where the objective of 
the design is to track pre-specified repetitive trajectory.  
However, it might be violated for disturbance rejection 
problems where periods or frequencies of the disturbances 
are mostly time-varying. 
Recent researches started studying control problems of 
rejecting/tracking spatially periodic disturbances/references 
for rotational motion systems using spatial-based repetitive 
controllers. A spatial-based repetitive controller has its 
repetitive kernel (i.e. Lse−  with positive feedback) 
synthesized and operate with respect to a spatial coordinate, 
e.g., angular position or displacement. Hence its capability 
for rejecting or tracking spatially periodic disturbances or 
references will not degrade when the controlled system 
operates at varying speed. Note that a typical repetitive 
controller consists of repetitive (i.e., a repetitive kernel) and 
non-repetitive (e.g., a stabilizing controller) portions. With 
the repetitive kernel synthesized in spatial domain and given 
a time-domain open-loop system, design of the non-repetitive 
portion that properly interfaces the repetitive kernel and the 
open-loop system actually poses a challenge. For rejection of 
spatially periodic disturbances, Nakano et al. (1996) 
reformulated a given open-loop linear time-invariant (LTI)  
system with respect to angular position, and linearized the 
resulting nonlinear system with respect to a constant 
operating speed. A stabilizing controller with built-in 
repetitive kernel was then synthesized for the obtained linear 
model using coprime factorization. A more recent and 
advanced design based on linearization using   robust control 
was proposed in (Chen et al., 2006). Although design 
methods for the linearized system are simple and 
straightforward, it is unclear whether the overall control 
system (which is nonlinear) will operate at varying speed or 
could sustain large velocity fluctuation without stability 
concern. For tracking of spatially periodic references, 
Mahawan and Luo (2000) proposed and proved the feasibility

Define [ ]0T vΩ = Ξ , i.e., the first column

With the definition of the state estimated error ε , the output 
equation in (4) can be expressed as 
 
1ˆ1 1

Substituting the first equation of (11) into (12), we have 
 
1ˆ11 01 0 1

To apply adaptive feedback linearization, differentiate the 
output yˆ  until the term involving the input uˆ  appears,

Define [ ]1 0 Ta a a=   , where 1a  and 0a  are the estimates of 
1a  and 0a , and 0b  is the estimate of 0b . The control law 
using the estimated parameters and states can be specified as

where ˆdv  is the estimate of a designable input ˆdv , ˆˆRu  is 
another designable input which will be used to target 
rejection of the periodic disturbances. Choose ˆdv  as 
 1 2ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ( ) ( )d m m mv y y y y yα α= + − + −    , (15) 
where 1α  and 2α  are adjustable parameters, ˆmy  is the

yˆ  cannot be measured directly because of parameter 
uncertainties. Let 0

A simple lead compensator

is sufficient to stabilize the overall output feedback AFLRC 
system. Suppose a motion control task demands the system to 
initially run at 60 rev/s and then speed up to 65 rev/s and 
finally speed down to 55 rev/s. To avoid getting infinite value 
when taking derivative, the reference command is specified 
to have smooth (instead of instant) change. Figure 2 
compares the frequency responses of 2 1( )( )M s s sα+    or

1( )( )M s s sα+    corresponding to three different designs. The 
dashed line labeled ‘w/o RC#1’ is the design with ˆˆ 0Ru =  
and ( )2( ) 1 1200 90000M s s s= + +    (i.e., without repetitive 
control); the solid line labeled ‘with RC’ is the proposed 
output feedback AFLRC design; the dash-dot line labeled 
‘w/o RC#2’ is the design with ˆˆ 0Ru =  but having a different 
( )2 9( ) 1 108000 8.1 10M s s s= + + ×    to produce 
approximately the same magnitude reduction at the four 
frequencies as specified in the case with repetitive control 
(the solid line). Figure 3 compares the tracking performance 
and control input for the three designs. The tracking error and 
the dead zone for the parameter update law, i.e., 
0
ˆ
Md  in (24), 
are significantly reduced for the output feedback AFLRC 
design when compared to those for the design labeled ‘w/o 
RC#1’. The design labeled ‘w/o RC#2’ has even better 
tracking performance, but the corresponding control input 
becomes large and goes negative most of the time, which will 
cause problems if the actuator has saturation limits. 
6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
This paper presents the design of a new spatial-based 
repetitive control system, which can be applied to rotational 
motion systems with uncertain parameters operating at 
varying speeds and subject to spatially periodic disturbances. 
The proposed design combines two control paradigms, i.e., 
adaptive feedback linearization and repetitive control. The 
overall output feedback AFLRC system can be proved to be 
stable and have bounded tracking error. Feasibility and 
effectiveness of the proposed design are further justified by 
simulation. Although this paper only presents the design 
method for a 2nd order system, the proposed design may be 
extended to higher order systems, which is currently under 
our investigation.
