本計畫針對 DNA 在流場中特別是自然對流流場中受流體影響而造成的拉伸現象進行
數值模擬。我們成功建立一個數值模式可以在連體力學的基礎上模擬 DNA 拉伸情形，
並計算相關的物理量。藉此可瞭解 DNA 在對流型聚合酵素連鎖反應器內，DNA 隨流
場內的應力變化而造成的變形與拉伸。這些資訊是過去研究對流型聚合酵素反應器的
研究人員極想瞭解的資訊。而目前一般 DNA 的拉伸是以分子模擬來進行，要模擬在
此種較大尺度的流場的變形，有計算時間過長的困難。因此此模式可在合理的時間內
提供研究人員想知道的資訊，進一步設計最佳化的反應器。此模式目前只有二維模式，
而且只測試單條 DNA 在流場內之運動。將來應朝三維及多條 DNA 之模式發展，以
提供更多更真實之 DNA 運動資訊。

INTRODUCTION
end remained free. Subsequently, DNA chain was stretched under uniform flows at a
variety of speeds. They compared the extension results with Smith et al.’s [5] and Bus-
tamante et al.’s [6] and found that the relationship between the extension of DNA chain
and the resultant force is exponential. Nevertheless, Perkins et al. [1] reported that DNA
chain is not free-draining even extended to its fully extended length.
In addition to experiments, numerical simulations of extension of DNA chain in a
uniform flow have been receiving attentions in several studies (Mohan and Doyle [8] and
Yang et al. [9]). For example, Cheon et al. [10] investigated the extension of DNA chain
in a uniform flow using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. They utilized a repulsive
Lennard-Jones potential and FENE potential to predict the interaction among monomers
along a sequence of the DNA chain. As a result, the predicted curve of extension of
DNA chain versus flow velocity is similar to Perkins et al.’s [1] experimental results.
Furthermore, they mentioned that DNA chain is not free-draining especially in a fast
uniform flow.
However, molecular dynamic simulation is very costly because of the limitation of
time increment and enormous numbers of monomers. The simplest theory of polymer
dynamics introduced by Kuhn [11] regards DNA chain as an elastic dumbbell in which
a spring connects two beads. Larson et al. [2] used a dumbbell model to simulate DNA
chain stretching in a uniform flow. They explained that when the drag coefficient of the
free end bead is equal to 0.73 times the drag coefficient of the undeformed DNA coil was
calculated by Doi et al. [12], the extension results show good agreements with Perkins et
al. [1].
The dumbbell model which considers polymer-solvent interaction only at two points
is oversimplified. An alternative approach called the coarse-grained bead-spring model
can also be used to predict the extension of DNA chain. The physical basis of the bead-

concept which transfers a continuous real DNA chain into a sectional freely jointed chain.
The excluded volume force among all DNA molecules can be ignored for a freely jointed
chain immersed in a theta solvent. In addition, the DNA molecular movement is regarded
as a random walk. In particular, a real DNA chain and a freely jointed chain have the
same equilibrium mean-square end-to-end distance < R2 >0 and fully extended length
L. Fig. 1 represents the coarse-graining method which obtains a freely jointed bead-rod
model at the first scaling process, producing a freely jointed bead-spring model at the
second scaling process.
The relations among the number of backbone bonds called base number n, length of
backbone bond ℓ, < R2 >0 and L for a real DNA chain were given by Larson [14] and
denoted as
< R2 >0= C∞nℓ

and
L = nℓ , (2.2)
where ℓ is a constant equal to 3.4 A˙ and C

is defined as the ratio of < R2 >0 of a real
DNA chain to < R2 >0 of a freely jointed chain. L can be measured by a experiment
such as Perkins et al. [1]. Furthermore, < R2 >0 of a real DNA chain is determined by

NK,S=NK/NS. Subsequently, the original length of a spring RS in the bead-spring model
is obtained by RS = bK(NK,S)
1/2.
In this study, the motion of the beads are governed by the Langevin equation in
the bead-spring model. The Langevin equation based on the Newton’s second law is a
dynamic model of molecules. Given that inertial force, spring force, hydrodynamic drag
and Brownian force are exerted on a bead, the bead motion can be described by

where ri is the displacement vector of the ith bead and m is mass of each bead. m is
derived by the formula Mn/ (NA (NS + 1)) where NA is the Avogadro constant equal to
6.02×1023 mol−1 and M is molecular mass of a base equal to 0.331 kg/mol proposed by
Lucien [18].
The spring force exerted on a bead follows the non-linear worm-like chain (WLC)
force law which was proposed by Bustamante et al. [6] and Vologodskii et al. [7] and

2.2 Numerical procedure of bead-spring model
The displacement of a bead is derived from the semi-implicit Euler method which integrate
the inertial force of a bead with a time increment. The semi-implicit Euler method are

where dtsub is the time increment utilized in a prediction of the extension of the bead-
spring model.
To determine dtsub, we consider an estimation for investigating the relations among
dtsub and the physical parameters, m, ξ and H . The simplify bead-spring model includes
two beads is used. The first bead is fixed at the original point and the Hookean spring
force of the bead-spring model replaces the WLC force. The Langevin equation becomes
mr¨i = ξ (u− r˙i) +Hri . (2.14)
Eq. 2.14 is the second order linear O.D.E.. As a result, the solution is denoted as

where c1 and c2 are constants. In the order magnitude analysis, the DNA chains in
the present study are considered where m ≈ O(10−21) kg, H ≈ O(10−10) kg/s2 and
ξ ≈ O(10−10) kg/s as shown in Table 1. Therefore,
√
ξ2 − 4mH approximates to ξ and
Eq. 2.15 becomes
rh ≈ e(−ξ)t/m . (2.16)
Because the velocity of the bead should not be larger than the ambient fluids after the
first time integration, the relation between the velocity of the bead and the inlet velocity

where u represents a velocity vector of flow, ρ is density of the fluid, P is pressure, ν
is kinematic viscosity, α is thermal diffusivity, SB is the buoyancy term and f is the
influence term generated by the beads. In particular, the momentum equation becomes
more complicated when ρ varies with respect to T in natural convection. To simplify the
problem, we utilize the Bossinesq approximation which regards ρ as a constant and only
applies a source term to the momentum equation to include the buoyancy effect. The
buoyancy term is denoted as
SB = gβ(T − Tref) , (2.21)
where g is gravity, β is thermal expansion coefficient and Tref is reference temperature.
Furthermore, Wu et al. [21] suggested that the Boussinesq approximation can be used
when the Rayleigh number is under 105. In our simulation for natural convection at
a RB-PCR reactor, the Rayleigh number is less than 100. Therefore, the Boussinesq
approximation can be used in the present numerical model. In order to investigate the
interaction between the ambient fluid and the DNA chain, the macroparticle module
included in CFD-ACE+ is used. The macroparticle module uses the surface marker point
approach which is similar to the immersed boundary method proposed by Peskin [22].
In the surface marker point approach, the fluid is represented in an Eulerian coordinate

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
α and β do not consider in the uniform flow field. Since the DNA chain is immersed in
the shallow flow cell as shown in Fig. 3, the motion of fluids in the z -direction is ignored.
Therefore, the simulation of the DNA chain stretched in the uniform flow is performed
in the 2D computational domain. In addition, dimensions of computational domains
and boundary conditions of the benchmark test are shown in Fig. 4. The length of the
computational domain varies from 26 to 46 µm for different DNA chains. Meanwhile,
the computational domains are 12 µm wide so the flow is not affected by the lateral
boundaries. For the boundary conditions, two lateral boundaries are defined as ∂u/∂y=0
and a constant pressure, 101325 Pa, is imposed at the outlet boundary. In particular,
the inlet velocity used in Perkins et al.’s [1] experiment is imposed at the inlet boundary.
Moreover, in our in-house code, the bead at the left end of the DNA chain is regarded
as being stationary since it was trapped by the optical tweezers in Perkins et al.’s [1]
experiment.
While the DNA chain is extended due to the moving fluids and almost reach the
maximum length due to the specific inlet velocity, the DNA chain oscillates and becomes
difficult to determine the maximum extended length. So long as the DNA chain oscillates
within 1 % of the fully extended length in the x -direction, we can say that the DNA chain
is well extended under the specific inlet velocity and the maximum extended length of the
DNA chain LD is then determined. Fig. 5 shows the DNA chain of L=44.0 µm stretched
in the uniform flow at the inlet velocity of 5.96E-6 m/s. Fig. 5(a) represents the initial
positions of beads and the flow pattern in the beginning of simulations. Subsequently,
the DNA chain is extended gradually due to the moving fluids. Fig. 5(b) revels the
flow pattern and positions of beads at 3.5 s of the simulation. We can observe that the
extensions of the DNA chain are started from the fixed end of the chain. Fig. 5(c) shows

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
annealing and extension and performed at T = 367, 328 and 345 K, respectively. In order
to generate those three thermal environments, a Rayleigh-Be´nard flow is performed at an
enclosed reactor with the top thermal boundary at 298 K and bottom boundary at 383 K.
While a DNA chain is at the reactor, it passes through those three thermal environments
continuously. Consequently, the DNA replication can be implemented at the RB-PCR
reactor. The quantity and preciseness of the replicated DNA chain are investigated using
the gel electrophoresis. However, the investigation of the extension and movement of the
DNA chain at the RB-PCR reactor are unknown. In order to predict the behavior of the
DNA chain in the RB-PCR, a simulation of the DNA chain of L=44.0 µm contained at the
RB-PCR reactor is performed using the proposed numerical model. The fluid properties
of the simulation are shown in Table 2 and 3 where ν are varied with T . The dimensions
of the computational domain and boundary conditions of the simulation are shown in
Fig. 11. In the present study, the computational domain is a square enclosure with the
dimension of 300 µm and can be regarded as a microreactor in a lab-on-chip. Since the
dimension of the computational domain is very small, the convectional intensity of the
fluid flow in the RB-PCR reactor is not strong enough to induce the Rayleigh-Be´nard
flow. So long as the RB-PCR reactor is 5o inclined to the vertical direction, a buoyancy-
driven flow is generated in the reactor. The buoyancy-driven flow which is similar to
the Rayleigh-Be´nard flow can drive the DNA chain to pass through the three thermal
environments in the RB-PCR reactor. In practice, the microreactor is manufactured by
etching processes producing a shallow channel for the DNA replication. Therefore, the
simulation is performed in the 2D computational domain. Moreover, all the boundaries
are defined as stationary solid walls. Subsequently, the left and right boundaries are set
as adiabatic walls. At the beginning of the simulation, a steady buoyancy-driven flow
without the DNA chain is obtained. Fig. 12 displays the velocity magnitude contours

than the beginning of the simulation. The direction of the DNA chain is reversed and
not parallel to the flow direction due to the velocity gradient along the y-direction at the
bottom.
Fig. 14 revels the time history of the extension of the DNA chain at the RB-PCR
reactor. We can observe that the extension of the DNA chain is greatly reduced from 0
to 4 s. Meanwhile, the DNA chain passes through the thermal environment at 368 K.
The DNA chain is accelerated by the ambient fluids from a rest state. Subsequently, the
extension of the DNA chain is slowly decreased from 6 to 12.5 s. It is because the DNA
chain at the top area of the RB-PCR reactor is driven by the fluid flow with the stable
velocity at 3.00E-5 m/s. After 12.5 s, the DNA chain is moved into the right high-speed
area of the fluid flow and the extension is greatly decreased. However, the retraction of
the DNA chain is not stronger than the beginning of the simulation. As shown in the
inset figure, the extension of the DNA chain is reduced to 1.5 % of L at the end of the
simulation. It is found that the DNA chain is retracted in the entire simulation and the
extension of the DNA chain can be regarded as with three stages.
Fig. 15 revels the time history of the rotating angle θ between the tangential direction
at the middle point B5 of the DNA chain. In the beginning, θ is equal to 0
o while the DNA
chain is placed horizontally. Subsequently, the DNA chain is transported and clockwise
rotated by the fluid flow. From t = 0 to 7.8 s, θ varies from 0 to 45o while the DNA chain
moves from the left side to the top side of the RB-PCR reactor. From 7.8 to 12.5 s, θ is
greatly increased while the DNA chain moves from the top to the right side of the reactor.
θ is almost 90o at t = 12.5 s. After 12.5 s, θ is greatly increased to 150o while the DNA
chain moves from the right side to the bottom. It should be noted that the DNA chain is
reversed but θ does not reach 180o.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
semi-implicit Euler method is performed. Since the semi-implicit Euler method is used
to calculate the Langevin equation with dtsub, r˙i and ri can be obtained. To improve the
efficiency of the simulation, the flow field is regarded as being ”frozen” during dt and the
bead-spring model is implemented by increasing dtsub.
In order to verify the bead-spring model, a benchmark test using the proposed bead-
spring model to predict the extension of the DNA chain in a uniform flow is performed.
Subsequently, the predicted extensions of the DNA chains are compared with Perkins et
al.’s [1] experimental results and show good agreements. So long as the inlet velocities
are faster than 2.00E-5 m/s, the difference percentage between the predicted results and
Perkins et al.’s results are less than 10 %. Moreover, we can observe that when the DNA
chain is stretched by the fast uniform flow, the DNA chain can be well extended very soon.
Also, a short DNA chain can be well extended sooner than a long DNA chain at the same
inlet flow. In terms of the benchmark test, it turns out that the proposed bead-spring
model is able to predict the extension of the DNA chain in the flow field. Furthermore, the
proposed bead-spring model is used to predict the behavior of the DNA chain of L=44.0
µm at the micro RB-PCR reactor which is used to replicate DNA in natural convection.
The predicted DNA chain can move freely with the ambient fluids at the RB-PCR reactor.
As a result, the extension and rotating angle of the DNA chain can be determined by the
proposed model. Also, the length of the springs, hydrodynamic drag exerted on the beads
and magnitude of the velocity of the beads of the bead-spring model are investigated. It
is observed that the DNA chain rotates, shrinks and is deformed while it moves. The
extension of the DNA chain is reduced to 1.5 % of L in the end of the simulation. In
addition, the DNA chain is clockwise rotated from 0 to 150o by the fluid flow. Therefore,
the DNA chain is almost reversed after one cycle. All |Si| are reduced which are less than
15 % of the RS in the end of the simulation. Meanwhile, it is observed that the reduction

二、與會心得 
本次會議參與人數眾多，約有兩百多位來自學界與產業界。顯見各界對海洋能源發
展之關心，台灣雖四面環海，但明顯的在海洋能源的開發與應用基本上是不足。而
海洋能源發展不僅是技術問題，其實還包括生態與經濟議題。因此各國目前開發海
洋能源不僅僅從技術上是否可以從海洋取得能源來探討而是包含對環境的影響及是
否能夠普及來研究。因此台灣若要發展海洋方面的能源工業，這些經驗都可用來借
鏡參考。

Session Name: 2-3: Fluid-Structure Interaction in Ocean Engineering_ 
 
Title: Numerical modeling of unprescribed solid motion in fluids 
 
Dr. Ming-Jyh Chern*, Dedy Zulhidayat Noor and Tzyy-Leng Horng 
 
Abstract 
 
An immersed boundary method with both virtual force and virtual heat is developed to solve the Navier-Stokes and the energy 
transport equations to study convection problems caused by a moving rigid solid object in an enclosure.  The key point of this 
novel numerical method is that the solid object, stationary or moving, is first treated as fluids governed by the Navier-Stokes 
equations for velocity and pressure, and by the energy transport equation at each time step.  Subsequently, an additional virtual 
force term is then compensated to the right hand side of momentum equations at the solid object region to make it acting 
mechanically like a solid rigid body immersed in fluid exactly.  Likewise, an additional virtual heat source term is applied to the 
right hand side of energy equation at the solid object region to maintain the solid object at the prescribed temperature all the time.  
The proposed method is validated by a group of benchmark forced and natural convection problems such as a uniform flow past a 
heated circular cylinder and a heated circular cylinder inside a square enclosure.  We further demonstrate this method by studying a 
mixed convection problem involving a heated circular cylinder moving inside a square enclosure.  The established method avoids 
the requested grid generation in the body-fitted method at each time step and shows great efficiency in the computation of thermal 
and flow fields caused by fluid-structure interactions. 
 
 Biography 
 
Ming-Jyh Chern received his first and master degrees from Department of Naval Architecture Engineering., National Taiwan 
University.  Subsequently, he was awarded a government scholarship for studying abroad.  He went to University of Oxford to 
pursue his PhD.  He was supervised by Prof. Eatock Taylor and Prof. Borthwick.  During his study at University Oxford, he 
developed a pseudospectral model to simulate the interaction of steep waves with offshore structures.  After he finished his PhD study, 
he returned to Taiwan and initiated research academic activity at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology to study free 
surface flows, industrial ventilation, biofluid dynamics, energy saving in buildings and advanced numerical methods for 
computational fluid dynamics.  His research results have been published in several international journals, such as Journal of Fluids 
Engineering, Journal of Biomechanics, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer and etc.
