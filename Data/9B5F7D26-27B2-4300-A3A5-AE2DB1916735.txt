The switching characteristics of a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3–bBaTiO3–c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 
(abbreviated BNBK 100a/100b/100c) lead-free ferroelectric ceramics are investigated.  
The total induced electrostrain (ε33,total) and apparent piezoelectric coefficient (d33) 
first increase dramatically and then decrease gradually as the BNBK composition 
moves from the tetragonal phase to the MPB and then to the rhombohedral phase.  
BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, a composition well within the MPB, exhibits a ε33,total of about 
0.14%, an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1, and a Pr of 22.5 µCcm-2.  These property 
values suggest a candidate material for lead-free actuator applications.

1. Introduction 
 
There has been a determined effort to develop lead-free ferroelectric ceramics of 
high piezoelectric properties by various doping and alloying routes, but no effective 
alternative to the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) system has yet been found [1].  
Nevertheless, several lead-free ceramic systems have shown great potentials.  Saito 
et al. [2] have developed a highly <001> textured alkaline niobate-based perovskite 
polycrystals with a piezoelectric charge coefficient d33 of 416 pCN-1, which is widely 
regarded as the closest lead-free system to the actuator-grade hard and semi-hard PZT 
ceramics to date.  A considerable literature also exists concerning the dielectric and 
piezoelectric properties of (1-x)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-xBaTiO3 (abbreviated BNBT-100x) 
and (1-y)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-y(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated BNKT-100y) solid solutions 
[3-9].  These two bismuth sodium titanate (BNT)-based ceramic solid solutions have 
rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) compositions existed 
on x = 0.06-0.07 for BNBT-100x and y = 0.16-0.20 for BNKT-100y [8-10].  From 
these two solutions, a ternary system, a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-bBaTiO3-c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 
(abbreviated BNBK 100a/100b/100c), can be developed [10].  In comparison with 
BNBT and BNKT, compositions of the BNBK ternary system typically exhibit higher 
depolarization and Curie temperatures [10].  So far the dielectric and piezoelectric 
properties of the BNBK system have received some limited attention [10-12].  
However, there is no systematic data available on its polarization and strain hystereses.  
This insufficiency is addressed in the present study.  The aim of this study is to 
investigate the switching characteristics of the BNBK family of lead-free ferroelectric 
ceramics, focusing on the MPB compositions.  This is achieved through examining 
their hystereses in the electric polarization (D) vs. electric field (E) and strain (ε) vs. 
 1
be calculated from the slope gradient of the D-E hysteresis curve at zero electric field. 
 
The stable strain ε-E hysteresis curves (i.e. butterfly curves) for the BNBK 
compositions inside and outside the MPB, measured at a cyclic electric field of 
amplitude ±5.0-5.5 MVm-1, frequency of 0.2 Hz, and sinusoidal waveform, are shown 
in Fig. 3.  It is evident that the tetragonal BNBK produces relatively the smallest 
strain under cyclic electrical loading.  The remanent strain (εr) and total electrostrain 
in the 33 direction (ε33,total) increase significantly when the BNBK composition moves 
from the tetragonal phase into the MPB, peaking at BNBK 6.5-20.  While εr remains 
relatively unchanged, ε33,total decreases progressively as the composition shifts away 
from the MPB BNBK 6.5-20 into the rhombohedral phase, which is achieved by 
increasing the BNT amount in the BNBK system.  The apparent d33 of BNBK 6.5-20 
is 295 pCN-1, an impressive number for a lead-free ferroelectric ceramic. 
 
The stable polarization and strain hysteresis curves for BNBK 90/5/5 and BNBK 
75/5/20 are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively.  Apart from the actuating 
properties such as ε33,total and d33, the heavily BNT-based rhombohedral BNBK 90/5/5 
also displays a much higher remanent polarization than the tetragonal BNBK 75/5/20.  
This is most likely due to the higher number of equivalent crystallographic directions 
which the spontaneous polarization could take up in a rhombohedral structure (i.e. 
eight [111] directions).  Nevertheless, the magnitude of strain produced by BNBK 
90/5/5 is still no match for those by the compositions well within the MPB. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In summary, the switching characteristics of the MPB compositions of the 
(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-BaTiO3-(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 lead-free system have been investigated.  
This is achieved through examining their polarization and strain hystereses.  The 
total induced electrostrain and apparent d33 increase dramatically when the BNBK 
composition moves from the tetragonal phase into the MPB.  They then decrease 
gradually as the composition shifts away from the MPB into the rhombohedral phase.  
Under an alternating electric field of ±5.0 MVm-1, BNBK 6.5-20 (a.k.a. BNBK 
85.4/2.6/12) exhibits a ε33,total of about 0.14%, an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1, an Ec of 
2.5 MVm-1, and a Pr of 22.5 µCcm-2.  These notable property values indicate that the 
BNBK 6.5-20 ceramic is a candidate material for lead-free actuator applications.

Abstract 
 
The polarization switching characteristics of lead-free a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3– 
bBaTiO3–c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbreviated BNBK 100a/100b/100c) ferroelectric 
ceramics are investigated.  The total induced electrostrain (ε33,total) and apparent 
piezoelectric coefficient (d33) first increase dramatically and then decrease gradually 
as the BNBK composition moves from the tetragonal phase to the MPB and then to 
the rhombohedral phase.  The measured polarization hystereses indicate that the 
BNBK compositions situated near the rhombohedral side of the MPB typically 
possess higher coercive field (Ec) and remanent polarization (Pr).  While the 
compositions situated near the tetragonal side of the MPB possess higher apparent 
permittivity.  BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, a composition well within the MPB, exhibits a 
ε33,total of about 0.14%, an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1, and a Pr of 22.5 µCcm-2.  
These property values suggest a candidate material for lead-free actuator applications.

ceramic powders were oven-dried (120°C, 24 h) and then pressed into sample discs.  
After debinding (600°C, 1 h), these sample discs were sintered at 1170°C for 2 h in air.  
In total 11 types of BNBK composition samples were prepared, and Fig. 1 shows their 
relative positions on the room temperature phase diagram of the (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3- 
BaTiO3-(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 ternary system.  Samples 1 to 9 situate within the MPB of 
BNBK and consist of 40 mol% BNBT and 60 mol% BNKT.  The exact constitutions 
of the BNBT and BNKT components of a BNBK sample are expressed by the number 
affixed; e.g. Sample 8, BNBK 6.5-20, consists of 40 mol% (Bi0.5Na0.5)0.935Ba0.065TiO3 
+ 60 mol% Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3.  Note that Sample 8, BNBK 6.5-20, can also be 
denoted as BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 by working out the exact percentages of the three 
constituents, (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3, BaTiO3 and (Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3.  Sample 10 (i.e. BNBK 
75/5/20) and Sample 11 (i.e. BNBK 90/5/5) are two compositions outside the MPB 
and situate at the tetragonal and rhombohedral regions, respectively.  They do not lie 
on the 40 mol%-BNBT-60 mol%-BNKT composition line.  For polarization and 
strain hysteresis measurements, sample discs were cut into cuboidal specimens 
measuring 10mm×10mm×3mm, and silver-based paints were applied onto the 
10mm×10mm faces to form electrodes for electric field excitation.  Electric field 
loading was applied using a high-voltage amplifier (Trek 20/20C), driven by a 
ferroelectric analyzer (aixACCT TF2000).  The polarization and strain of the 
specimen during electrical loading were measured by the ferroelectric analyzer and 
miniature strain gauges (TML FBX-04-11-005LE) attached onto the 10mm×3mm 
faces of the specimen, respectively.  All hysteresis measurements were carried out at 
room temperature (~ 25°C) with the specimen contained within a silicon oil bath to 
prevent electrical breakdown. 
 
3. Measurements and discussion 
 
3.1 Polarization hysteresis 
 
The stable polarization D-E hysteresis curves for the BNBK, BNBT and BNKT 
specimens, measured at a cyclic electric field of amplitude ±5.0 MVm-1, frequency of 
0.2 Hz, and sinusoidal waveform, are shown in Fig. 2.  It is evident that BNBT is the 
“softest” among the three ferroelectric systems with its specimens showing the 
highest average Pr and lowest average Ec.  In contrast, the BNKT specimens exhibit 
the lowest average Pr and a less sharp polarization transition at the coercive field (i.e. 
switching is completed over a wider range of electric field) – both are indications of a 
“hard” ferroelectric system.  The switching behavior of BNBK in terms of 
hardness/softness falls in between the BNBT and BNKT systems and is strongly 
 3
electric field of ±5.0 MVm-1, BNBK 6.5-20 (a.k.a. BNBK 85.4/2.6/12) exhibits a 
ε33,total of about 0.14%, an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1, an Ec of 2.5 MVm-1, and a Pr of 
22.5 µCcm-2.  These notable ferroelectric property values indicate that the BNBK 
6.5-20 ceramic is a candidate material for lead-free actuator applications.
