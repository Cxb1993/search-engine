2fluid analysis. In conclusion,
ibuprofen-loaded PCL film provides good
anti-adhesion effect and improves the
bio-adhesive ability.

Introduction
Adhesions are the main causes of
intestinal obstruction in developed countries.
They are responsible for 15-20% of
infertility cases and are associated with
chronic abdominal and pelvic pain.(1,2)
Various anti-adhesion devices have been
presented in literature, the most common of
which is the polymeric membrane(3,4),
which separates and isolates the wounded
tissue after surgery.
Polycaprolactone (PCL) is biodegrade
type of biodegradable polyester with
potential applications for bone and cartilage
repair, with advantages over other polymers
like PLA (poly lactic acid). Its advantages
include being more stable in ambient
conditions, significantly less expensive, and
readily available in large quantities (5).
Previously, a novel anti-adhesion film made
of polycaprolactone has been introduced
that led to better prevention of peritoneal
adhesion in an animal study (6,7). The PCL
film must be fixed by two sutures for
security because PCL is hydrophobic.
However, this fixation stitches, which are
foreign bodies, can create adhesion
formation problems. To solve this,
increasing bioadhesion is an essential issue.
Ibuprofen (Ibu), a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is used
for relief of rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis. However, its use is limited by
side effects, which are often due to high
plasma levels following administration of
conventional formulations (8). Local
application may alleviate the systemic side
effects, while the hydrophilic capacity of the
biomaterials can be increased by some
modifications (9).
In this study, ibuprofen-loaded PCL was
developed to facilitate a controlled-release
of the drug. The synthesized film was
characterized and its performance evaluated
and compared with SeprafilmTM, and PCL
film. The contact angles of PCL and
PCL-Ibuprofen film with different
ibuprofen-to–PCL fractions were also
conducted. An animal study was performed
to find the efficacy of different films for
anti-adhesion.
Materials and methods
Preparation of PCL and PCL-ibuprofen
film: A 3 % (W/W) PCL (Sigma, Aldrich,
Germany, MW 80,00) was prepared by
dissolving the PCL in ethyl acetate (Walko,
Osaka, Japan), stirring it with an electric
magnetic bar, and heating to 50 0C. After
completely dissolving the PCL, the solution
(600  l) was poured onto the surface of a
2.2 X 2.2 cm cover glass and evaporated at
45 0C, 1 atm for three days to obtain the dry
film. The films were then sterilized by UV
radiation 8 hours before use. Fabricating the
PCL-ibuprofen film was similar except that
ibuprofen was added (Sigma, Aldrich,
Germany) at a ratio of 1:10 to PCL.
4analyzed by UV-Vis spectrophotometer at
220 nm. The aliquot from the pristine PCL
film was used as the control (100%). All of
the experiments were done in triplicate and
mean values were reported.
Animal experiments :Forty (40) Wister rats
(200–250 g) were divided into three groups.
The animals were anesthetized with
Zoletil-50 (Vibrac Lab, France) (1 mg/100 g)
and the abdomen were swabbed with 70%
alcohol and iodine. A 3-cm-long vertical
midline incision was made, and the distal 3
cm of the cecum and opposing abdominal
wall were scraped with a scalpel blade
carefully until the serosal surface was
disrupted and hemorrhaged but not
perforated. The denuded peritoneal wall was
then covered with one of the following:
SeprafilmTM (1.5 cm x 1.5 cm),
Polycaprolactone (1.5 cm x 1.5 cm), or
PCL-ibuprofen film (1.5 cm x 1.5 cm). The
PCL film was fixed to the serosa with two
4/0 Vicryl stitches.
Rats of the control group were not
covered with any anti-adhesion film. The
denuded cecum and opposing peritoneal
wall were maintained in all animal groups
with two non-occluding loops of 4/0
polypropylene suture placed 2 cm apart. The
purpose of the sutures was to approximate
the abraded areas and to fix the floppy rat
cecum. Care was taken to prevent puncture
of the cecal wall. After completion of the
procedure, the abdomen was closed in a
double layer using 4/0 polypropylene in a
continuous fashion.
Assessment of adhesions: Evaluation was
carried out in a blinded fashion. After 1
week, the rats were sacrificed by carbon
dioxide asphyxiation. The peritoneal cavity
was opened via a U-shaped incision, with
the base at the lower abdomen for complete
exploration. Adhesions were examined and
noted. Peritoneal adhesions were
meticulously dissected and the intestine was
opened along the mesenteric attachment for
measurement. The specimens were placed
without tension on a plain surface for
transfer of the adhesion areas to a
translucent film. The latter was scanned
together with a reference of scale. Images
were then analysed (10) and areas were
computed (mm2) using DP-Soft 3.0
(Olympus, Hamburg, Germany).
Adhesions were scored in two ways.
One, the quality of adhesions was scored
using a modification of a reported method
(11). Score 0 meant no adhesion, score 1
was for tissue adherence separable by
gravity, score 2 was tissue adhesion
separable by blunt dissection and score 3
was adhesions requiring sharp dissection. If
there were multiple adhesions of different
scores, the higher one was selected. Two,
the total area of score 2 or 3 adhesions was
measured for quantitative evaluation of the
extent of adhesions.10 The evaluator was
not aware of the experimental group to
which individual animals belonged.
Peritoneal fluid analysis: Peritoneal fluid
was collected before the operated animals
were incised on the 7th day post-surgery.
The peritoneal fluid was aspirated through a
pipette with a bulb tip after 10ml of
6was placed between the injured sites, four of
the total 10 rats showed tissue adhesion. In
the PCL group, two of 10 rats demonstrated
adhesion to a lesser degree. In addition,
there was adhesion in three of 10 rats in the
PCL-Ibu film group.
Compared to the control group, the
Seprafilm, PCL, and PCL-Ibu groups
significantly prevented adhesions. There
was no statistically significant difference
among the Seprafilm, PCL, and PCL-Ibu
groups.
After more objective evaluation for
areas of adhesion, the control group had
bigger areas of adhesion (50.4±25.3 mm2)
(Table 2, and Fig. 6). This was statistically
and significantly higher than that of the
Seprafilm (11.2±20.8 mm2), PCL (2.2±6.96
mm2), and PCL-Ibu (3.6±11.4 mm2) groups.
There were also no statistically significant
differences in the Seprafilm, PCL, and
PCL-Ibu groups.
Discussion
Post-surgical adhesions are abnormal
tissue attachments that result from cuts or
tissue abrasions during surgery. These
adhesions develop as part of normal wound
healing as tissue response to the trauma. The
process of adhesion formation initially
involves the establishment of a fibrin
framework and normal tissue repair. The
normal repair process allows for fibrinolysis
alongside a mesothelial repair. However, in
surgical adhesion formation, the fibrin
matrix matures as fibroblasts proliferate into
the network. Angiogenesis occurs and
results in the establishment of organized
adhesion within 3-5 days. The first 2-3
post-operative days are critical for adhesion
formation (12).
When the serosa on the surface of an
intra-peritoneal organ is damaged,
post-operative adhesions can occur if that
serosa becomes fused to other peritoneal
tissues during healing. It is known that
peritoneal restoration begins with the
invasion of multi-nuclear leukocytes
through the surface of the damaged
peritoneum, and that by day 7, the damaged
part is almost completely covered with
mesothelial cells (13). This is the rationale
for observing the results 7 days after
surgery.
Following major abdominal surgery,
60–95% of patients develop adhesions (14).
Post-surgical adhesions severely affect the
quality of life of millions of people
worldwide, causing small-bowel obstruction
(15), difficult re-operative surgery (16),
chronic abdominal and pelvic pain (17), and
female infertility (18,19).
Barrier devices have been widely used
to prevent contact between injured surfaces
(20). Hyaluronic acid-carboxymethy
lcellulose (HA-CMC; Seprafilm Genzyme,
Cambridge, MA, USA) is a non-toxic,
biocompatible material that turns into a
hydrophilic gel approximately 24 h after
placement. It provides a protective coat
around the traumatized tissue. HA-CMC has
been evaluated in several animal
experiments and its efficacy has been
demonstrated in two clinical studies of
gynecological and visceral surgery (21, 22).
However, in clinical use, Seprafilm falls
8non-interconnected pores on both surfaces,
while the PCL-Ibu film has many rough pits.
Such roughness allows the film to reduce
the water tension and lessen its contact
angle, and increase its hydrophilic capacity
and bioadhesive ability.
LDH cytotoxicity testing shows that the
Seprafilm, PCL and PCL-Ibu films are all
biocompatible in this study. They are all
suitable to be placed in the tissues.
Water can be conducted to the film layer
and allow the release of the drug. The
thickness of the PCL-Ibu film in this study
is around 45±3 μm, which wil make most 
of the ibuprofen rest on the surface, leading
to the burst release effect.
The peritoneal fluid neutrophil and
monocyte populations also show no
statistically significant difference. This
determination of leucocyte population in
peritoneal fluid provides information on the
degree of inflammatory response
surrounding an implant.
To evaluate adhesions, the scoring
system is rather subjective, even though the
blinded fashion may help provide more
objectivity. Measuring adhesion areas is
another objective method. In this study, PCL
and PCL-Ibu films achieve significant
results compared to the control group not
only in scoring system but also in
measurement of adhesion area.
Conclusions
Ibuprofen-loaded polycaprolactone
film can satisfactorily prevent post-surgical
adhesion. It also enhances the hydrophilic
capacity and bioadhesive ability, which can
alleviate the problem posed by stitches fixed
to the serosa in PCL films. Because
polycaprolactone is rather cheap, and
ibuprofen is widely used, this composite
achieves promising results.

一、 參加會議經過
二○○九年 第十七屆 ICCE-17 國際複合材料與奈米工程研討會，於民國
九十八年七月二十六日至八月一日，在美國夏威夷州之檀香山市(Honolulu,
Hawaii, USA)歐胡島的希爾頓王子飯店舉行，由國際複合材料與奈米工程學會與
美國紐澳良大學共同舉辦。ICCE總會(總部在美國紐澳良大學)每年舉辦一次例行
的國際性研討會，第一屆到第十一屆都在美國境內舉行，第十二屆以後則輪流在
全世界各大城市舉行，主要探討複合材料與奈米材料與工程相關的最新進展，尤
其是與複合材料、奈米科技、生物晶片、診斷治療之新儀器等相關議題。去年在
中國大陸的昆明市舉行，今年是第十七屆，為複合材料與奈米工程相關之最重要
的研討會之一，每年大約有將近壹千人參加這個盛會。個人受研討會主席
Professor. David Hui(美國紐澳良大學的教授)的邀請參與盛會並發表論文。
本次會議共計有將近一千篇的研究論文發表，約有上千位來自世界各地的研
究學者參與，是屬於一個領域相當廣泛的會議。本次會議的主題包含有奈米材
料、數學模擬、磁性材料、一般性材料、金屬材料、紡織材料、及奈米生物醫學
材料等等。大會也有安排許多專題演講，講題包括
關，這是一項非常新穎而精密的技術。
而我們本次的口頭報告還算順利，雖然中間因為大會提供的電腦軟體是 office
2007與我的檔案模式 office 2003略有不同，造成部分圖檔有所異動，與我們原
先設定的內容有所差異，其他部分大致上都還算是不錯。我們所報告的論文題目
是以硬脂酸(Stearic Acid)接枝聚乙烯亞胺 (Polyethyleneimine)之奈米微胞作為基
因治療载體的研究，這是一種新的基因載體材料，所以報告的時候，引起現場許
多迴響。本次報告結束後，有許多研究學者提出問題，其中一位是波蘭的女教授
WANDELT提出，由於這位教授本身的對 chitosan (幾丁聚醣)有很深入的研究，
因此詢問：「是否有試過幾丁聚醣當材料，做為非病毒性的基因載體？」由於幾
丁聚醣亦屬於帶正電性的可分解性聚合物，我們在之前也曾經做過實驗測試，幾
丁聚醣所造成的細胞毒性相對較小，但是它的轉染效率仍低於 PEI
(polyethyleneimine)。 此外，我們所製備的奈米顆粒具有雙極性，可用於包覆疏
水性的藥物。因此我們所製備的奈米載體，不止可以用在攜帶基因，並可用來包
覆疏水性的抗癌藥物，形成多功能的藥物釋放系統。再經由特定抗體的標定，可
以增加藥物傳輸的專一性，提高治療效率。
另一位提出問題的學者是日本的 ASANUMA教授，主要是詢問「是否有與
其他已商業化帶正電性的聚合物比較過？」目前我們所比較過的聚合物主要有
PEI本身以及 lipofectamine，目前已商業化的產品中，以 lipofectamine最為被廣
泛使用，但是其本身由於對細胞的毒性較高，且易受到血清蛋白的影響而降低轉
染效率，因此相對下，在同時具有血清蛋白的環境下，與我們所製備的基因載體
的轉染效能差異不大，此外我們的載體主要能提供多功能性的條件，這是一般市
面上所販賣的基因載體所無法提供的。
二、與會心得
本次能有機會帶學生一起參與這次會議，觀摩學習，讓柏士班學生有機會與
世界各國的研究學者討論，實屬一次非常難得的機會。 這次會議舉行的地點是
在夏威夷，是各大家公認最適合度假的勝地之一，會議在此舉辦，除了可以和世
界各國的複合材料、奈米科技、生物晶片等專家學者一起討論外，也可以藉此機
會放鬆心情，去感受到夏威夷的美與優閒，以及宜人清爽的天氣與亮藍的海灘。
檀香山市是一個國際化的都市，最近發展得相當快速，是一個風景相當漂亮的城
市，展現出全新的風貌，是一塊天然的瑰竇。在軟体設施万面，許多訓練有素的
導遊，可以詳細為你介紹每個建築物的特點。
夏威夷景致
路上的行人都是非常健康的在享受陽光，反倒是陽傘及防曬設備的出現顯得
突兀。威基基海灘果然名不虛傳，金黃色的沙灘上有著來自世界各地的遊客，各
個不吝嗇與陽光交涉，享受大自然的擁抱，衝浪客們也各自施展好身手，徜徉在
大海之上。在夕陽照應下的海灘更顯得迷人，海岸旁的椰子樹更添意境，這就是
著名的威基基海灘。沿著海岸線附近，隔著一條馬路，有著許多商店及各大飯店，
越接近夜晚，路上的街頭藝人紛紛出現，好不熱鬧。夏季時節，夏威夷仍有著清
涼的微風，舒爽宜人的天氣，難怪吸引了世界各地的遊客。
