Abstract 
The purposes of this research are to develop the modules of process, models, and 
peripheral circuit design of low-temperature poly-Si thin film transistors (LTPS TFTs), which are 
suitable for the applications of system on panel. . In this project, a novel method of crystallization, 
continuous wave laser crystallization, is proposed to produce lateral grain growth via controlling 
the laser scanning speed and laser power. LTPS TFTs with ultra-high performance and excellent 
uniformity will be fabricated by using the novel continuous-wave (CW) laser crystallization 
method (field-effect mobility exceeding 504 cm2/V-s for n-channel devices and 220 cm2/V-s for 
p-channel devices, respectively). It is also found that CW laser annealing is a low-thermal-budget 
and high-efficiency dopant activation method attributed to the low sheet resistance and uniformly 
redistributed dopant profiles after CW laser annealing. In addition, we will also utilize the dynamic 
stress, UV light illuminating, constant current stress, static stress, and bias-temperature stress (BTS) 
methods to measure the reliability of poly-Si TFT fabricated by CW laser lateral crystallization. 
The various aspects of the degradation seen in the poly-Si TFTs will be discussed quantitatively. 
Moreover, the model of the degradation mechanism will be built-up and to estimate the lifetime of 
TFT devices. On the other hand, we will begin our development from process simulation to set up 
the models and simulation tools for TFT technology using CW laser recrystallization.  We 
performed process simulation for CW laser recrystallization including heat transfer, laser energy 
adsorption and latent heat during melting and solidification.  Because of the reduction of grain 
boundaries in TFTs fabricated by CW laser annealing, we developed device simulation tools.  The 
influence of grain boundary orientation on TFT characteristics is numerically simulated in three 
dimensions.  In order to evaluate the impact of grain boundary reduction on the uniformity of 
TFT performance, this project developed the methodology for extracting statistical device 
parameters of polycrystalline silicon TFTs. Finally, many peripheral driving circuits, including the 
driver circuits: digital to analog converter (DAC), output buffer for source drivers and level shifter 
for source/scan drivers with CW-laser crystallized LTPS TFT device for TFT-LCDs. We have 
designed, simulated, and manufactured the data drivers, then recorded the measurement results. 
We can see the measurement results, the INL/DNL of the novel DAC is within 1 LSB. The offset 
voltage of novel output buffer is limited in 0.064 mV in middle gray-level. By utilizing 
diode-connected active loads, the power consumption of the proposed level shifter had been 
diminished successfully. Meanwhile, these driving circuits, which are with the advantages of small 
area, low power consumption, and high speed, can be integrated onto the TFT-LCD array substrate 
to meet the requirement of system on panel. 
Keywords: low-temperature poly-Si thin film transistors, continuous wave laser

fluctuation of pulse-to-pulse laser energy density, non-uniform laser beam profile, and 
non-uniformity of a-Si thin film thickness make laser energy density hard to hit the super lateral 
growth (SLG) regime everywhere [6] – [7]. Non-uniform and randomly distributed poly-Si grains 
will result in large variation of TFT performance when the laser energy density is controlled in the 
SLG regime, especially for small geometry TFTs [8]-[10]. Increasing laser shot density per area 
may improve the crystallization uniformity and promote the secondary grain growth [11], however, 
the mass production throughput will decrease. Besides, excimer laser annealing has some essential 
drawbacks such as complex optical system, high facility cost, troublesome maintenance, and poor 
output energy stability. As a result, novel crystallization methods are strong demanded to enhance 
both the device performance and uniformity for next generation LTPS TFTs. 
Large-grained poly-Si thin films always result in high-performance LTPS TFTs by reducing 
the defect traps in the grain boundaries and the interior grains. Hence, recently, solid-state laser 
crystallizations of amorphous silicon, including pulsed YAG2ω green laser, selectively enlarging 
laser crystallization (SELAX), green laser annealing double layer x’tallization (GLADLAX), visible 
laser induced lateral crystallization (VILC), double–pulsed laser annealing, and the diode-pumped 
solid-state (DPSS) continuous wave laser lateral crystallization (CLC), have been widely studied by 
effectively enlarging the poly silicon grain size for high-performance TFTs as compared with 
conventional excimer laser crystallization [12] – [43]. Among these crystallization methods, 
diode-pumped solid-state continuous wave laser lateral crystallization proposed by Hara et al. has 
been demonstrated to fabricate high-performance poly-Silicon TFTs on non-alkali glass substrate 
because of the large directional silicon grains. In addition, CW laser lateral crystallization has the 
advantages of simple process, superior power stability, wide laser process window for large grains, 
high throughput, and easy maintenance. The comparisons of excimer laser and DPSS continuous 
wave laser are listed in Table I. In the previous work, although single-grain TFT has been 
demonstrated to exhibit high device performance and good uniformity, the grain size is limited to 2

 2 Experiments 
 
   Figure 7-1 shows the key processes for the fabrication of LTPS TFTs crystallized by using 
frequency doubled diode-pumped solid-state continuous-wave laser irradiation. At first, a 500 
Å-thick a-Si layer was deposited by pyrolysis of pure silane (SiH4) by LPCVD at 550°C. Laser 
crystallization was performed by diode-pumped solid-state continuous-wave laser (λ=532nm). 
During the laser irradiation, the samples were located on a substrate in air and substrate was 
maintained at room temperature. The power of laser energy density and the speed of substrate were 
varied. Several material analysis techniques were used to investigate the relation between the 
morphology of crystallized poly-Si thin films and laser process conditions. They include optical 
microscopy (OM), Raman spectroscopy analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. In 
order to facilitate the SEM observation, some samples were processed by Secco-etch before 
analysis. After defining the device active region, a 1000 Å-thick TEOS gate oxide was deposited by 
PECVD at 385°C. Then, a 2000 Å-thick a-Si thin film was then deposited by LPCVD at 550 °C for 
gate electrode. The a-Si thin film and gate oxide were etched by RIE and BOE to form the gate 
electrode. A self-aligned boron or phosphorous ion implantation with dose of 5×1015cm-2 was 
carried out to form source and drain regions. Next, a 3000 Å-thick TEOS passivation oxide was 
deposited by PECVD at 350°C and the implanted dopants were activated by thermal annealing at 
600°C for 12 hours in the N2 ambient . Finally, contact hole opening and metallization were carried 
out to complete the fabrication of CW laser annealed LTPS TFTs. Finally, LTPS TFTs were 
passivated by 2-h NH3 plasma treatment to further improve the device performance. For the sake of 
comparison, the conventional excimer-laser-crystallized LTPS TFTs with a channel thickness of 
500Å were also fabricated. In addition, the doped polycrystalline silicon thin films via various 
 8
thermal-budget and high efficiency method.  
Figure 7 (a) shows a SEM picture of continuous-wave laser crystallized poly-Si with laser 
power of 8W and laser scanning speed of 1cm/s after Secco etching. In this case, the laser energy 
fluence is sufficient to induce melting of amorphous or crystalline silicon thin films but laser energy 
density is low. The laser fluence is larger than the threshold energy of crystallization but is low 
enough that a continuous layer of solid Si remains (i.e., melt-depth < film thickness). Therefore, the 
grain size is limited by high quenching rate. As a result, laser power increases, larger poly-Si grains 
are produced. Figure 7 (b) displays a SEM picture of continuous-wave laser crystallized poly-Si 
with laser power of 10W and laser scanning speed of 1cm/s after Secco etching. The grain size is 
about 0.3um and is larger than that of 8W. As laser power increases to 12W, the a-Si thin film is 
completely melting due to high laser energy. In this situation, a lateral grain growth can be 
stimulated by continuous-wave laser crystallization. Figure 7 (c) displays a SEM picture of 
continuous-wave laser crystallized poly-Si with laser power of 12W and laser scanning speed of 
5cm/s after Secco etching. A directional grain growth with size of 15 µm in length can be 
stimulated by continuous-wave laser crystallization. According to SLG model, the lateral grain 
growth is resulted from a thermal gradient in solid/liquid interface. The SLG distance is determined 
by the quenching rate of liquid silicon and the lateral growth velocity which is a function of lateral 
thermal gradient. Therefore, the SLG distance can be increased by enlarging the lateral thermal 
gradient. Figure 7 (d) shows the damaged poly-Si thin films after CW laser irradiation due to the 
too high laser energy density. Figure 8 displays the SEM picture of continuous-wave laser 
crystallized poly-Si with laser power of 12W and laser scanning speed of 5 cm/s after Secco etching. 
It can be obviously distinguished that there are four different kinds of polycrystalline silicon grain 
structure in the CW-laser crystallized poly-Si thin films. 
Raman spectroscopy is a standard characterization method in field of thin film silicon. By 
measuring the Raman spectra in the range of 100 ~ 900 cm-1, information on the crystallinity was 
obtained. Figure 9 display the Raman peak intensity of the crystallized poly-Si thin films with laser 
 10
Figure 14 shows the plane-view TEM picture of continuous-wave laser crystallized poly-Si 
thin films. The plane-view TEM image displays a directional river-like lateral Si grain growth with 
tens of micron. The selected-area electron diffraction pattern reveals that the crystallite exhibits 
<111> orientation with excellent quality. The diffraction pattern from the CW laser crystallite is 
made up of simple spots, and this means a single-crystal silicon region is formed by this novel CW 
laser crystallization.  Figure 15 shows the cross-sectional TEM picture of continuous-wave laser 
crystallized poly-Si films. The cross-sectional TEM displays a rough surface morphology and ridge 
in the grain. Figure 16 (a) and 16 (b) show the high-magnification TEM image and electron 
diffraction pattern of a CW laser crystallite, respectively.  
Figure 17 exhibits the mechanism of continuous-wave laser lateral grain growth to explain the 
directional-controlled poly-Si thin films. In the SLG regime of ELC, the maximum point of melting 
the un-melted portion of the underlying Si no longer forms a continuous layer but instead consists 
of islands of solid that are separated by small local regions of completely molten silicon. The 
un-melted islands act as solidification seeds, from which a lateral grain growth commences. 
However, in the CW laser crystallization, a lateral temperature gradient can be created between the 
adjacent areas and there must be un-melting solid Si to act as the seeds for lateral crystallization. By 
completely melting the a-Si thin film in a certain region using CW laser and the solidified poly-Si 
films at the adjacent area, a large lateral temperature gradient will exist between the complete 
melting liquid-phase region and un-melting solid-phase seeds, and grains will grow laterally 
towards the complete melting region from the un-melting solid seeds. The lateral grain growth will 
eventually be arrested by lateral grains grown from the other side.  
Figure 18 (a) and 18 (b) compare the transfer and output characteristics of the n-channel LTPS 
TFTs using CW laser crystallization with those by ELC, respectively. Figure 19 displays the 
electrical characteristics of the p-channel LTPS TFTs using CW laser crystallization. Some 
important electrical characteristics of LTPS TFTs are also listed in Table III. Owing to large 
longitudinal grains growth in the channel regions, LTPS TFTs crystallized using CW laser exhibited 
 12
cross-sectional TEM picture, a flat surface morphology is formed in the grain boundary which is 
suitable for gate oxide scale down. According to the experimental results, ultra high-performance 
CW laser-crystallized LTPS TFTs have been demonstrated with field-effect mobility of 505 
cm2/V-s for n-channel devices and 220 cm2/V-s for p-channel devices, respectively. Besides, dopant 
activation by CW laser annealing is also studied. A comparison of the efficiency of dopant 
activation among various activation methods is studied in detail. It can be found that CW laser 
annealing is a low-thermal budget and high-efficiency activation method attributed to the low sheet 
resistance of 50 Ω/□ and uniformly redistributed dopant profiles after CW laser annealing. CW 
laser-annealed LTPS TFTs are, therefore, very promising for the future system-on-panel (SOP) and 
3D-ICs applications because of the simple process.

們考慮到 UV 光是種高能量的光，紫外光的波長大致介於 200nm~400nm，相當於 6.2ev~3.1ev 
[1]，而 TFT 中的 Si 成分， 其能帶為 1.12ev，所以 UV 光的強度足以產生電子電洞對，甚
至破壞 Si-H 鍵（Si-H 鍵會經由氫電漿鈍化過程中產生）或產生不必要的缺陷，這些可能會
出現的不良結果足以影響 TFT 的電性。   
    另外我們在太陽能電池的壽命測試中，也發現到長久時間的照光使得元件特性衰退，也
在一些期刊上發現到也有人用 UV 光來照射太陽能電池，使其老化[2]，或是測其穩定度[3]。
因為這些原因促使我們想研究 UV 光是否會造

測UV光造成的TFT元件電性衰退，可能是UV光的照射造成介電層和通道層的介面處有Trap

crystal.  Most of TFTs 
(LTPS) have been demonstrated to have carrier mobility higher than 300cm2/Vs [1].  These 
high-performance TFTs can be used not only for switching but also in support circuits for LCD.  
Therefore, system on panel (SOP) can be realized by using TFTs with LTPS.  In addition, LTPS 
TFTs are suitable for driving organic light emission diode (OLED) because they are reliable under 
high current stress.  However, the uniformity of LTPS TFTs needs to be improved.  Conventional 
LTPS technology adapts excimer laser annealing (ELA) to recrystallize amorphous silicon [2].  To 
obtain large grains, recrystallization must proceed under super lateral growth (SLG).  Unfortunately, 
SLG can be obtained only in narrow process conditions.  This degrades TFT uniformity. 
Continuous wave (CW) laser recrystallization has been developed to control the growth direction. 
CW laser recrystallization can reduce the number of grain boundaries in the channel region of TFTs.  
However, the performance of TFT is dominated by the distribution of few grain boundaries.  It is 
essential to establish the theory and models related to CW laser technology.   
Wood and Giles [3] investigated heat transfer and laser energy adsorption during pulse laser 
annealing.  In 1991, Kuriyama et al. [4] studied excimer laser annealing and TFTs with LTPS. 
The recrystallization mechanism with excimer laser was reported by Im et al
1 
was developed [6].  In 2000, simulation of heat transfer in conjunction with recrystallization was 
developed for excimer laser crystallization [7].  There is no simulation tool developed for CW laser 
recrystallization.  Device simulation for polycrystalline silicon TFTs has been developed for 
qualitative analysis [8-11].  The critical issue is three-dimensional distribution of grain boundaries 
in TFT.  Because the distribution is complex, a large number of mesh points are needed for device 
simulation.  This limits the development of TFT device simulation.  However, CW laser 
recrystallization reduces the number of grain boundaries are able to control the orientation.  It is a 
good opportunity to develop TFT device simulation based on CW laser technology.  In the 
development of TFT compact models for circuit simulation, conventional modeling is based on TFT 
with small grains [12-15] formed by solid phase crystallization.  Although there are models 
considering grain boundaries [16,17], modeling for laser annealing technology with very few grain 
boundaries is still not ready.  With the development of new recrystallization techniques, statistical 
modeling provides more information on the device uniformity.  As a result, this project works on 
process and device simulation for TFT fabricated by CW laser annealing.  Statistical modeling is 
developed for device uniformity.

However, the laser beam scans through the simulation region for CW laser annealing.  The scan 
speed is too small in comparison with the distance between mesh points.  This means that the laser 
beam must stay in one position for a long period and then move to the next mesh point.  In this 
case the simulation fails to describe the scanning feature of CW laser annealing.  Such simulation 
is close to the pulse laser process like excimer laser recrystallization.  During excimer laser 
recrystallization, the heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the substrate.  The heat 
transfer can only be modulated by the structure of the substrate or the substrate heating.

4 STATISITCAL MODELING 
 
CW laser recrystallization increases grain size and therefore enhances TFT performance.  However, 
high performance TFTs have the potential to be integrated into circuits to generate more functions.  
Statistic analysis of TFT performance is important because the speed of circuits is usually limited 
by worse devices.  To perform statistic analysis, randomness from grain boundary distribution 
should be taken into consideration.  We adapted Monte Carlo method to generate random 
distributed grain boundaries.  The Monte Carlo simulation is based on recrystallization physics, in 
order to integrate process simulation with statistic analysis.  The simulation flow chart is shown in 
Fig. 9.  The simulation domain is represented by several elements in two dimensions.  Then the 
position of nucleation and growth is chosen by random number.  Another random number is 
chosen afterward to determine the occurrence of nucleation or growth.  The occurrence probability 
depends on the nucleation and growth rates based on classical phase transformation theory.

The grain distribution from Monte-Carlo simulation based classical recrystallization theory is 
shown in Fig. 10.  In order to get the statistical characteristics of TFTs fabricated on the 
polycrystalline layer after recrystallization, a program was developed to calculate the number of 
grain boundaries.  The device regions are randomly selected on the recrystallization, as shown in 
Fig. 10.

The distributions of grain boundary number in a device region are plotted in Figs. 11 and 12.  
Figure 11 demonstrates the size effect on grain boundary number variation. The variation is 
increased with smaller device geometry.  Figure 12 shows variations due to different length/width 
ratios of TFTs.  It is demonstrated that the variation is similar but the distribution is changed with 
the length/width ratios.

 圖二十八所示為電壓位準轉換器，本電路利用二極體-連結負載(Diode-Connected Load)的方
式。一方面將電晶體的閘極與汲極短路，這個電晶體便等效成一電阻，在串聯數個等效成電
阻的電晶體後，使輸出端的貫穿電流(penetrating current)降低。另一方面，這又是個箝位電路，
它使VDD在經過數個VT的壓降之後，驅動電壓也減少了許多。綜合以上兩點，功率消耗便被
大幅的縮小了。 
 
圖二十九為電壓範圍之模擬圖。輸入之波形為 100 kHz 0-3 V 的方波，負載電容為 0.5 pF。電
壓源為 12 V。圖三十為輸入一 100 kHz 0-5 V 的方波，供應電壓 15 V，由圖三十可看出，輸
出範圍由原本的 0-5 V 加大為 0-15 V。
