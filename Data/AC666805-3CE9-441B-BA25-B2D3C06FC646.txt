Keywords: ultrafast optics, nonlinear optics, pulse measurement, quasi-phase matching, nonlinear 
laser dynamics 
 
Determination of spectral phase of ultrafast signal is essential in a variety of applications, 
such as coherent control, nonlinear spectroscopy, and adaptive pulse compression. For lack of 
electronic response in the femtosecond regime, nonlinear optical techniques are usually employed 
to perform “temporal gating” or “spectral shearing” to retrieve the signal waveform. As a result, 
the existing characterization schemes are subject to three key issues: (1) poor sensitivity due to 
low nonlinear conversion efficiency; (2) complexity to phase-match a broad spectrum by thick 
nonlinear crystals; (3) slow update speed due to time-consuming data acquisition and/or 
post-processing. We intend to develop new methods of ultrafast signal phase characterization to 
overcome these limitations. To be specific, we propose to: (1) measure the spectral phase 
analytically by using thick nonlinear crystals, which was supposed to be impossible; (2) measure 
the spectral phase in real-time by nonlinear interferometry, where nonlinear optical and RF 
photonics approach is used to generate the interferogram; (3) simplify the system and 
substantially relax the demands on resolution of the spectrometer encountered in (2) by spectral 
shearing interferometry. The development of these new schemes will rely on (as well as facilitate) 
integration and advancement of ultrafast signal characterization, ultrafast nonlinear conversion, 
integrated optical devices, RF photonics, nonlinear laser dynamics, and signal processing. We 
expect to push the frontier or even redefine the classic methodology of ultrafast signal 
characterization, which will be the backbone of the future “optical oscilloscope”.

is the normalized IA function [I(t)|a(t)|2]. For well-behaved pulse shapes, the pulse width t can 
be roughly estimated (with an uncertainty of ~10%) by deconvolution of the correlation width  
of G2(). Nevertheless, G2() only delivers very limited pulse information for lack of information 
about temporal phase of a(t) and spectral phase of intensity I(t).

2) Frequency resolved optical gating (FROG): 
FROG [3] is a time-frequency technique to derive complete amplitude and phase 
information. It applies the strategy of: (a) using the unknown pulse itself for ultrafast gating; (b) 
recording data points more than the degrees of freedom (data redundancy), then retrieving the 
complex field by iteration. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of conventional second-harmonic 
generation (SHG) FROG. The noncollinear SHG geometry can spatially separate the field product 
term a(t)a(t−) from the remaining self-squared terms a2(t), a2(t−). By measuring the SH 
power spectrum for each delay , we obtain the FROG trace: 
phase () (with a resolution of ) can be derived by concatenation. 
 
Fig. 3. Schematic diagram of SPIDER. 
SPIDER is very attractive in many aspects: (a) It requires no iteration and can be 
performed in real time (~10 Hz) [8]. (b) The setup is directly applicable for single-shot 
measurement. (c) The delay  is fixed, therefore, no moving part in the apparatus. This is 
especially important in constructing a reliable integrated system. (d) The useful information is 
preserved in the fringe density variation of interferogram [see eq. (3)], therefore, is less sensitive 
to phase-matching bandwidth and detector spectral response. (e) There is no ambiguity in the 
phase retrieval. SPIDER has been successfully used to measure 2.8-fs pulse [9]. 
 
四、研究方法 
We propose new femtosecond pulse measurement schemes in order to: (1) extract complete 
spectral phase by using a simple and highly efficient thick nonlinear crystal, which was supposed 
impossible; (2) measure complete spectral phase by SPIDER [7], where two phase-locked 
monochromatic beams arising from cost-effective optically injected semiconductor lasers [10] 
provide the spectral shearing; (3) simplify the system complexity and relax the demands on 
resolution of the spectrometer encountered in (2) by spectral shearing interferometry. 
 
1) Complete even- and odd-order spectral phase retrieval by thick nonlinear crystals: 
It has been widely recognized that insufficient phase-matching (PM) bandwidth causes 
distortion in measuring intensity autocorrelation (IA) function [11]. As a result, researchers have 
in Tab. 1, field autocorrelation function G1() gives “half” the complex field information 
(power spectrum |A()|2). Intensity autocorrelation function G2() only provides a “quarter” 
of the complex field information (power spectrum of intensity 
2
)(~ I ). Single MIFA trace 
provides a “quarter” of the complex field information [even-order spectral phase e()]. 
Fortunately, power spectrum [mutually exclusive to e()] is easily measurable, and the 
second MIFA trace unravels the remaining quarter of complex field information [odd-order 
spectral phase o()]. In this perspective, MIFA scheme makes use of the recorded data more 
efficient (targeting at the spectral phase that is difficult to be measured) than existing 
autocorrelation techniques.

(b) Since the MIFA scheme employs thick nonlinear crystal to get sufficiently narrow PM 
bandwidth, the sensitivity can be considerably enhanced (roughly proportional to the crystal 
thickness L). 
(c) The measurement apparatus (Fig. 4) does not need spectrometer, detector array, iterative 
algorithm, thus far more cost-effective than existing complete pulse measurement schemes.  
(d) If the frequency doubling is achieved by QPM technique, MIFA measurement does not need 
to chirp the QPM period of thick nonlinear crystal for PM bandwidth broadening, further 
simplifying the design and fabrication process. 
2) Optically injected semiconductor lasers (OISL) for spectral shearing in SPIDER: 
As pointed out earlier, SPIDER normally relies on nonlinear mixing (e.g. SFG) between the 
normalized injection strength   between the master and slave lasers. With proper adjustment, 
the slave laser can be operated in a period-1 oscillation state (P1) [13]. In the P1 state, the slave 
laser is frequency-locked to the master laser with a frequency detuning that can be controlled by 
adjusting the injection strength and the frequency detuning between the master and the slave 
lasers. A frequency detuning of 100 GHz has been examined experimentally. 
Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of OISL SPIDER. 
The proposed OISL SPIDER scheme is shown in Fig. 6, where an optically injected 
semiconductor lasers system provides two phase-locked, monochromatic optical beams with tens 
of gigahertz frequency separation for spectral shearing. Compared with standard SPIDER (Fig. 3), 
the proposed OISL SPIDER has many attractive advantages: 
(a) Improved sensitivity because of: (i) no waste of optical power in chirped pulse generation 
and nonlinear mixing, (ii) the power of spectrogram signal can be enhanced by increasing the 
power of monochromatic beams. 
(b) Since the test pulse and the monochromatic waves from OISL are centered at different 
wavelengths (say 1550 nm vs. 1310 nm), SHG due to the test pulse or OISL waves is either 
absent (not phase-matched) or spectrally separated from the SFG signal. This will permit 
using collinear type-1 SFG (thus QPM PE LiNbO3 waveguide) in SPIDER. 
(c) Decoupling between spectral shearing  and temporal delay , thus relaxing the 
determination of system parameters and eliminating recalibration for different 
measurements. 
(d) Much narrower monochromatic line width (in the order of megahertz) improves the capability 
of measuring fine spectral structure and long pulse. 
OISL SPIDER could be limited in two aspects. First, the cost could be somewhat increased 
for it requires two nonlinear crystals for frequency conversion (will be improved in topic 3). 
Second, the attainable spectral shearing (i.e. spectral resolution of the measurement) is less than

In addition to the advantages enjoyed by OISL SPIDER, the OISL spectral shearing 
interferometry improves on: 
(a) The demands on resolution of spectrometer (thus system cost) are substantially relaxed for 
lack of “excessive” fringes caused by large delay .  
(b) Only one nonlinear crystal is required. This results in lower cost, less complexity, and better 
stability (does not need to align two paths simultaneously) of the system. 
In summary, the proposed schemes will substantially improve on the methodology of 
femtosecond pulse characterizations. The development of these schemes requires integration of a 
couple of important areas, including ultrafast optics, radio-frequency photonics, nonlinear optics, 
integrated optical devices, and signal processing. The accomplished results will be a significant 
milestone toward ultrasensitive, real-time, optical oscilloscope. It will contribute to scientific 
instrumentations, coherent control, ultrafast spectroscopy, as well as ultrafast signal generation 
and processing. 
 
五、結果與討論 
We have successfully achieved complete even- and odd-order spectral phase retrieval by thick 
nonlinear crystals, resulting in four prestigious journal publications (Optics Letters 2, Optics 
Express 2). The OISL SPIDER and spectral shearing interferometry schemes are subject to low 
coherence problem of the OISL source. We are still looking for gated detection system to carry 
out the experiments in the presence of low coherence. Here is the summary. 
 
1) MIFA measurement with record high sensitivity: 
We proposed and experimentally demonstrated analytic (iteration-free) complex field retrieval of 
femtosecond pulses by using modified interferometric field autocorrelation (MIFA) method [16]. 
The setup is simply a standard collinear autocorrelator except that a thick (thus highly efficient) 
nonlinear crystal replaces the conventional thin crystal for SHG. In contrast to existing thick 
crystal-based pulse measurement techniques, MIFA does not need to tightly focus the input beam 
thickness of nonlinear crystal is limited by ~10 m to provide sufficiently broad phase-matching 
bandwidth, resulting in very low conversion efficiency. (2) The phase-matching spectrum of 
10-m-thick BBO crystal remains significantly uneven, and (3) the silicon detector has strong 
frequency dependence over such a broad (>100 THz) bandwidth. In collaboration with Prof. 
Takayoshi Kobayashi at NCTU, we used MIFA method with 300-m-thick LBO crystals 
(phase-matching bandwidth is only 12 THz, ~10% of the input pulse bandwidth) to successfully 
retrieve 8-fs pulse produced by noncollinear optical parametric amplification (NOPA) process. 
The corresponding experimental setup and the measurement results of MIFA and FROG are 
shown in Fig. 9.

BS: Beam splitter. (b) Spectral phase curves retrieved by MIFA at 1.1 nJ (solid), and FROG at 28 nJ 
(dashed-dotted), respectively. The inset shows the temporal intensity. (From [19].) 
 
3) Spectral phase retrieval by interferometric spectrogram: 
In another work [20], we investigated spectral phase retrieval by processing interferometric 
spectrogram (also known as iFROG trace) with three different methods: FROG, MEFISTO [21], 
and MIFA. Our experiments showed that: (1) Analytic solutions of spectral phase derived by 
MIFA and MEFISTO are consistent with the iterative solution derived by FROG, providing a 
reliable way to check the measurement integrity. (2) In the event of low signal-to-noise ratio, 
MEFISTO suffers from higher error, while MIFA can achieve the same accuracy as FROG by 
weighted average of multiple solutions derived by single interferometric spectrogram. An 
example of the experimental results is shown in Fig. 3. 
during the measurement of four (can be reduced to three) interferograms (  0 , 2 ,  , 
23 ) such that phase reconstruction from Eq. (8) can succeed. Unfortunately, the shortest 
integration time of our CCD array (Jobin Yvon, Sygnature) is 10 ms, which is supposed to be 
much longer than the mutual coherence time of OISL source. As a result, we could not acquire 
stable interferogram for phase measurement. Detector array with fast (~10 ns) electronic gating 
costs dearly and will compromise the advantage of using OISL source (cost effective). 
 
Fig. 12. The power spectrum of an OISL source operated at P1 state.  
We theoretically analyzed the impact of mutual phase incoherence between the master and 
slave lasers upon the error of spectral phase reconstructed by spectral shearing interferometry. Fig. 
12 illustrates the contour of rms phase error rms  due to the two normalized relative phase errors 
1 , 2  in the measurement of three SFG interferograms, where   NNi iirms   1 2ˆ , i  
and iˆ  represent the measured and actual spectral phase at the ith sampled frequency. It is 
evident that the mutual phase coherence of the OISL source places a stringent restriction on the 
phase reconstruction.

where γ represents the carrier frequency reduction factor (γ = 0.038 in our experiments). The signal pulse pair was
coupled into a 5-cm-long fiber-pigtailed periodically poled LiNbO 3 (PPLN) waveguide for second-harmonic genera-
tion (SHG). The PM tuning curve of the PPLN waveguide has a sinc 2-shape with an FWHM of ≈ 0.24 nm (50 GHz),
and the peak wavelengths were set to 1560.2 nm (45 ◦C) and 1561.2 nm (51.5◦C) when acquiring the two MIFA traces,
respectively. The average SH power at each delay is detected by a photomultiplier tube and a lock-in amplifier.

Fig. 2 illustrates the retrieved spectral phase profiles at coupled average powers of 0.26 nW (open circles) and 0.8
μW (solid), respectively. Fitting the phase profile ψ( f ) measured at low (high) input power over a frequency range of
≈ 1 THz gives rise to quadratic and cubic coefficients of c2= 1.12 ps2 (c2= 1.12 ps2), c3= -0.49 ps3 (c3= -0.48 ps3),
where ψ( f ) ≡ c2 f 2 + c3 f 3. The 0.26 nW average power is equivalent to 10 μW peak power, 5.2 aJ pulse energy,
and 40 photons per pulse. These numbers correspond to an unprecedented sensitivity (the product of peak power and
average power of minimum detectable signal) of 2.7×10−9mW2, improving on the previous records of FROG [11] and
MI-based MIFA [9] by 1,000 and 40 times, respectively. The improvement of sensitivity mainly comes from the longer
lock-in time-constant (50 ms, vs. 0.64 ms in [9]), which is made possible by the reduced equivalent carrier frequency
(0.038 f0) due to the shaper-assisted CEP control. The high stability of the current experimental configuration was
verified by measuring the quadratic spectral phase at 15 nW average power for 30 times (lasting about 150 minutes).
As shown in Fig. 3, the standard deviation is only 0.017 ps2, equals to the dispersion of 3.9-cm-long single mode fiber.
3. Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the shaper-assisted MIFA method using long PPLN waveguides can retrieve the spectral
phase of ultraweak ultrashort pulse with extremely high accuracy and stability. The achieved sensitivity is 2.7×
10−9mW2, improving on the previous record by a factor of 41. This work is supported by the National Science Council
of Taiwan under grant NSC 97-2221-E-007-028-MY3 and NSC 97-2112-M-007-025-MY3.

3.  Results 
In all of our simulations, we used L=1.89 cm, p=16 [Eq. (4)], and restricted all the domains longer than 4 µm. When 
there is only one target PM peak at 1550 nm, HAOS+ID gives a periodic QPM grating of period 18.9 µm as 
expectation. In designing five PM peaks distributed in V-shape as in [5], HAOS+ID with unit block length dx=0.1 
µm and N=189,000 (Fig. 1, solid) achieves both unprecedented overall efficiency (ηtot=94%) and nearly perfect 
spectral fidelity (∆η=5×10-5). The overall efficiency is 25% and 9% higher than those of AOS (dotted, ηtot=75%) 
and NOS (dashed, ηtot=86%), respectively. The minimum domain length is 8.9 µm, well above the limit of poling 
techniques [6,7]. In this design, the ID algorithm continues for 1,586 iterations, taking ~30 minutes by a typical PC 
(~14 times faster than NOS+GA). To demonstrate the uniqueness of HAOS+ID, we designed a grid of 101 PM 
peaks uniformly distributed within λ=1547-1572 nm by using dx=0.2 µm and N=94,500. Such a high complexity is 
intractable for the previous schemes. Fig. 2 (solid) shows that the resulting PM tuning curve is continuous, for the 
peak spacing (0.25 nm) is smaller than the width of individual peak (0.6 nm). The passband ripple ∆ηrip, defined as 
±0.5[max(η)−min(η)]/mean(η) for λ∈[1547,1572] nm, is only ±3.4%, smaller than that obtained by apodization 
(~±8%) [6]. ∆ηrip <±0.5% is feasible (Fig. 2, dashed) if using the state-of-the-art poling technique [7].

4.  Conclusions  
We demonstrated that HAOS+ID can achieve arbitrary discrete PM peaks and continuous PM power spectra with 
unprecedented conversion efficiency and target complexity. The algorithm has high computation efficiency and can 
converge to a quasi-optimal solution. Experiment is ongoing and promising for each domain is longer than the limit 
of our poling technique [5]. This work is supported by NSC-Taiwan under grant 97-2221-E-007-028-MY3.

produce three and four isolated pulses with unequal and equal temporal spacing, respectively. The DL with Z0=150 
mm (β=111 fs/mm2) was supported by the ONT team of the Fern Universität Hagen in Germany by means of a 
lithography procedure. The home-made SHG FROG system consists of a non-collinear Michelson interferometer, a 
10-μm-thick BBO crystal, and a spectrometer (USB 2000+, Ocean Optics). The FROG traces were obtained by 
recording a series of second-harmonic (SH) power spectra at different delays, then processed by a commercial 
software (FROG3, Femtosoft) to retrieve the complex fields. 
Fig. 1a and 1b illustrate the measured and retrieved FROG traces with a FROG error of 1.37%, respectively; 
when mask M4 and a pinhole of 50 μm in diameter were used. The traces exhibit clear modulation along delay and 
wavelength axes, which is the signature of pulse sequences. The retrieved temporal intensity (Fig. 1c, solid) exhibits 
four pulses centered at [0, 298, 490, 723] (fs), consistent with the simulated result (Fig. 1c, dashed). The stronger 
decay of the retrieved pulse amplitudes is mainly attributed to the spatially nonuniform irradiance across the mask. 
The retrieved power spectrum (Fig. 1d, solid) also agrees well with the simulation (Fig. 1d, dashed) in terms of the 
positions of the spectral peaks. The retrieved phases (Fig. 1c and 1d, dash-dot) are subject to higher error, for SHG 
FROG is unable to uniquely determine the relative phases of well-separated pulses [8]. The measurement results of 
another pulse sequence produced by mask M3 and a pinhole of 20 μm in diameter are shown in Fig. 2. The retrieved 
temporal intensity (Fig. 2a, solid) correctly shows three isolated pulses, while the unequal spacing between adjacent 
pulses results in more complicated spectrum and higher measurement error.

4.  Conclusions  
We experimentally measured the complex fields of pulse sequences generated by an all-diffractive DQST pulse 
shaper for the first time. This technique is promising in generating user-defined temporal waveforms in XUV and x-
ray ranges. This work was supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (MEC) through Consolider 
Programme SAUUL CSD2007-00013 and the project FIS2010-15746. It was also supported by “Convenio UJI-
Bancaixa” under grant INV-2010-42 and National Science Council of Taiwan under grant 97-2221-E-007-028-MY3.
