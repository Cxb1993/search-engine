 promote the one-stage synthesis of ionic liquids, given that it can reduce the reaction time and increase 
productivity. 
In the ultrasound-assisted two-stage synthesis of RTILs the reaction time and temperature can be 
controlled so as to result in higher yield, more energy is conserved and the need for excess solvent is 
eliminated [12]. Two stage synthesis can also change the ionic liquid’s characteristics and viscosity by 
replacing the anion in the hydrocarbon chain which can lead to the formation of new and more task 
specific ionic liquids [13][14][15], while reducing the period of alkylation of halogen hydrocarbons 
and organic solvents. 
Therefore this study is based on the two-stage ultrasound assisted synthesis of [bmim]PF6 and its 
application as an extracting agent for Cu
2+
 ions from industrial electroplating wastewater with the 
objective to test RTILs/chelating agent mixture as a suitable and efficient extracting agent for the 
general treatment of wastewater.   
 
2. Methods and Materials 
2.1 Experimental Equipment 
Ultrasonic reactor (mixsonic Sonicator S-4000), vacuum filters (GELMAN SA55JXDTD-4144), 
freeze-dryingmachine. 
 
2.2 Experimental Methods 
In The first stage of synthesis reactions, 0.3 mol of N-methlimidazole and 0.3 mole of  1-bromo-
butane were placed in a heating reflux device where the temperature was controlled at 40℃. The 
mixture was then subjected to ultrasonic irradiation for 1-3 hours.After irradiation the mixture was 
washed with ether until all the unreacted material was removed. Vaccum distillation was the used 
and the dry weight after 24 hours was determined, this first stage resulted in the synthesis of RTIL 
[bmim]Br. 
In The second stage of synthesis reactions,A mixture of acetone and KPF6 of known proportion 
was made. The RTIL [bmim]Br made in the first stage synthesis was obtained and mixed with the 
acetone/KPF6 solution. The resulting mixture was placed in a tree hole glass reactor. The mixture was 
then subjected to ultrasonic irradiation for 20-50 minutes.Vacuum distillation was used and the dry 
weight after 24 hours was determined, this second- stage resulted in the synthesis of RTIL [bmim]PF6.  
 
2.2.1 Metal ion extraction steps 
9.5mL of wastewater containing heavy metals of 250ppm was obtained. 0.5ml of EDTA 
(Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) chelating solvent was measured and added to the 9.5mL of heavy 
metal wastewater. 1mL of ionic liquid was measured and added to the 10mL mixture of heavy metal 
wastewater/ chelating agent (ionic liquid volume: heavy metal waste volume = 1:10). At a constant 
temperature of 25 ± 1 ℃, the mixture was shaken thoroughly for 1 minute to ensure uniform mixing. 
It was then placed in a centrifuge for 5 minutes at a speed of 3000rpm. After centrifugation the upper 
solution was then taken and placed in a Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AA) to detect the 
concentration of heavy metal ions in the upper solution and to be able to calculate the efficiency of 
ionic liquids in extracting heavy metal ions from wastewater. The experiment was repeated again but 
with no chelating agent being added; the heavy metal extraction efficiency of the ionic liquid was 
calculated. The experiment was repeated a few more times but with varying pH conditions; the heavy 
metal extraction efficiency of the ionic liquid was calculated in each case.  
 
2.3Experimental Analysis 
Analysis of heavy metal ions was based on the flame atomic absorption spectra (Atomic 
Absorption Spectrophotometer, AA) and the analysis of the RTIL was based on the FTIR ( Fourier 
Transform Infrared Reflection).

Fig. 1  Ultrasonic-assisted synthesis of [bmim]Br ionic liquids impact on yield at different times 
 
From 30-90 minutes the yield increased significantly as the mixture of 1-bromobutane and 1-
methylimidazole gradually changed from the original clear solution to a turbid solution, which 
corresponds with the findings by Varma (2002). However, when the reaction time exceeds 120 minutes, 
the percentage yield falls to a lower rate, this might be due to the fact that continuous exposure to 
ultrasonic waves and the resulting imploding cavitation bubbles can lead to an increase in the bulk 
temperature of the reactants to about 80-90℃. This increase in temperature may have resulted in 
higher losses of the reactants by volatilization leading to a slight decrease in percentage yield [20]. 
Fig. 2 shows the effect of different reaction temperatures on the yield of [bmim]Br, which can 
reach up to a percentage yield of 83% with the assistance of ultrasonic irradiation. However, even 
though ultrasound irradiation is a key element in rapid synthesis reactions, its effect will still be 
limited by the reaction temperature which makes it a very important factor as well. When the 
temperature is set at 30℃, the reaction between 1-bromobutane and 1-methylimidazole does not 
completely occur for the given reaction time. This is because even with the added phenomenon of high 
temperatures and pressures given by collapsing bubbles produced by ultrasound; these effects are only 
localized to the microenvironment of the molecule. So after the bonds are broken in the molecule, 
energy still needs to be provided to allow the molecules to rotate and translate in the medium to 
increase the chances of random collisions and thus reactions. This intermolecular energy can only be 
obtained from the heat energy being provided; therefore the higher the temperature the higher the 
percentage yield of RTILs. However, with higher temperatures also come more complications and at a 
temperature of 60℃ the percentage yield is shown to decrease significantly. According to Poole (2004) 
at elevated temperatures chemical transformations can take place in the ionic liquids due to the 
reactivity of the cations and anions; some of these reactions involve nucleophilic displacement of 
halogens from saturated carbon atoms, degradation of alkanethiols, proton transfer and more [21].

Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the molar ratio of 1-bromobutane and 1-methylimidazole 
and the percentage yield of ionic liquid [bmim]Br, with the best yield of 83% [bmim]Br being 
obtained with a molar ratio of 10:13. When the molar ratio was 10:10 the percentage yield was of only 
72%. Therefore increasing the molar ratio showed an increase in yield of ionic liquid since the higher 
concentrations of reactants lead to a higher reaction rate and more products being produced. However 
this increase was found to be limited at a ratio of 10:13 since any ratio higher than that was found to 
cause a decrease in the percentage yield; a ratio of 10:14 was found to give a yield of 76%.

Fig. 6 Ultrasound-assisted synthesis in [C4mim]PF6 ionic liquid at different amplitude power of the 
impact on yield 
Fig. 7 shows the relation between the reaction temperature and the yield of ionic liquid. When the 
temperature was set at 65℃, the best yield of 93% was obtained, this was because the temperature 
provided enough heat energy for effective collisions between reactive species. However, when the 
temperature exceeds 65℃, the percentage yield decreases dramatically, this might be caused by other 
side reactions such as proton transfer, oxidation, degradiation of alkanethiols, etc. which are a result of 
high temperatures [22].

Fig. 10 shows the relationship between pH value and extraction rate of Cu
2+
 ions. With a reaction 
time of 3 minutes and the addition of a chelating agent to the ionic liquid the best result of 98% was 
obtained with a pH value above 8. As far Cu
2+
 ions are concerned, a change in pH has a large effect on 
their fate of being removed from the wastewater. If the pH is low and the wastewater is acidic, the 
copper compounds remain in soluble ion form and present a real challenge to remove. However, if the 
pH is raised and the wastewater turns more basic, the Cu
2+
 ions react to form insoluble hydroxide 
compounds and precipitate; thus being easily removed. With respect to EDTA, however, a change in 
pH does not significantly affect their ability to form copper complexes, but do appear to work more 
efficiently in basic environments.

In the today＇s modern industries, the over use of volatile organic solvents in 
extraction processes and chemical reactions is becoming a problem and concern for 
many people. As environmental awareness continue to rise due to rapid industrial 
development and excessive resource consumption, more research is being done on 
RTILs and in verifying their suitability as an alternative to traditional solvents. 
Early synthesis of RTILs proved to use very long synthesis times and the loss of 
starting materials was great. Recently ultrasound has found useful applications 
in many areas of chemistry and other sciences, mainly due to its ability of 
producing cavitation bubbles. In this experiment ultrasound will be used for the 
rapid two-stage synthesis of [bmim]PF6 and the various parameters that provide 
the best conditions will be explored, also the ionic liquid will then be used as 
an extracting agent for the liquid-liquid extraction of Cu2+ ions from industrial 
wastewater. The results showed that for the ultrasound-assisted rapid two-stage 
synthesis of [bmim]PF6 the best yield was of 75% and the optimum reaction conditions 
were: (1) reaction time of 150 minutes； (2) molar ratio of 10:11； (3) reaction 
temperature of 85 ℃  and (4) Amplitude of 60%, indicating that ultrasound 
application was very effective. Studies have shown that ultrasound application 
can drastically reduce the synthesis time of RTILs, compared to the traditional
