Abstract 
Taiwan is an important research and manufacture center of thin film transistor liquid crystal 
display (TFT-LCD). Most of the organic pollutants in the TFT-LCD wastewater are resulted 
from the production and cleaning processes. Due to limited water resources and increasing 
stringent environmental regulations in Taiwan, the TFT-LCD wastewater must be treated 
properly and recovered for process reuse. Therefore, this study compared the performance of 
various advanced oxidation process (AOP), Fenton method, UV/TiO2, UV/H2O2, and O3, for 
TFT-LCD organic wastewater treatment. The AOP processes evaluated the COD removal 
performance by batch experiment.  The results show ozonation is the most efficient AOP to 
degrade COD.

Introduction 
TFT-LCD industry is one of important 
industries in Taiwan.  However, the 
processes of TFT-LCD use a huge amount 
of water and organic solvents.  Due to 
limited water resources and increasing 
stringent environmental regulations, the 
TFT-LCD wastewater must be treated 
properly and recovered for process reuse.  
AOPs have been shown to be effective for 
the elimination of organic and inorganic 
pollutants from water and wastewater [1-2]. 
Therefore, the objective of this study is to 
evaluate various AOPs including Fenton 
method, UV/TiO2, UV/H2O2, O3, for the 
COD reduction in the TFT-LCD organic 
wastewater. 
 
Materials and Methods 
In this study, four AOPs were 
evaluated and the experimental apparatus 
are shown in Figure 1 to Figure 4.  For 
each process, the wastewater at desired pH 
was treated in the jacket reactor with 
temperature controlled by a thermostatic 
bath (Water bath D-630, Deng Yng, 
Taiwan). The maximum treatment time was 
2 hours and the COD was analyzed by the
