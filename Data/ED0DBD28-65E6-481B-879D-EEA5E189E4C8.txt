英文摘要： In this 3-year project, an aerobic membrane bioreactor 
(MBR), an in-line flocculation MBR system and a 
sponge-MBR were conducted to evaluate their 
feasibility and characteristics for treating septic 
tank effluent. The comparative results of three 
different systems based on various parameters are 
summarized as follows: 
1. For aerobic membrane bioreactor, the removals of 
TCOD, SCOD and NH4+–N varied between 86-94%, 71-86%, 
and 70-94%, respectively. For in-line flocculation 
MBR, the removals of TCOD, SCOD, TKN and TN varied 
between 94-96%, 85-91%, 99-100% and 65-85% 
respectively. For sponge-MBR, the removals of TCOD, 
SCOD, TKN and TN varied between 75-97%, 65-96%, 98-
100% and 15-82%, respectively. It is obvious that in-
line flocculation MBR system achieved the highest and 
much stable removal for the target pollutants. 
2. For aerobic membrane bioreactor, irreversible 
membrane fouling occurred fast and water cleaning for 
the improvement of filtration capacity was 
ineffective. The addition of C-PAM can reduce membrane 
fouling in the in-line flocculation MBR system. The 
improvement of membrane fouling in anoxic-MBR system 
by adding sponge was significant, a slow increase of 
TMP was observed and the system could be run without 
membrane replacement and chemical cleaning for around 
110 days.

台灣地區家庭廢水污染河川情形嚴重，其中又以化糞池放流水污染量之比例為最大，佔百
分之四十五以上。另外，台灣地區每人每日生活用水中僅約21%為飲用水和炊煮用水，且
有將近40%是不直接與人體皮膚接觸之用水，因此實行按質供水將可大量節約自來水，是
極富經濟效益的用水模式。對於建築物雜排水再利用而言，選擇雜排水再生處理設備，除
了能達到再生水水質標準外，應以高效率、低成本、佔地小與簡易操作技術為原則。傳統
化糞池在處理負荷方面，由於設計不良或因管理不當，往往無法有效處理，放流水中氨氮
成份仍然偏高，對承受水體之污染不可言喻，對下水道尚未普及之地區，應可提供替代方
案，以提升及補強化糞池系統之效能。
本計畫為 3 年期專題研究計畫，主要為利用薄膜生物反應槽及其複合系統處理化糞池出流
水。計畫成果摘要簡述如下：
第一年: 本年度研究係建構ㄧ實驗室級沉浸式好氧薄膜生物反應槽處理系統(Submerged
Aerated Membrane Bioreactor, SAMBR)，處理化糞池出流水。本研究共分為 5 個實驗階段進
行，研究之變數主要包括 NaHCO3 添加濃度變化（0、250、500 mg/L）與不同之污泥停留
時間(SRT)（不排泥操作、SRT=10 天、SRT=20 天），研究薄膜生物反應槽系統淨化化糞池
出流水，瞭解碳與氮系列污染物之降解變化、薄膜流通量與阻塞特性、胞外聚合物之產生
及其它水質因子與系統操控反應之關係。研究結果顯示，TCOD、SCOD 與氨氮之去除率範
圍分別為 86-94%, 71-86% 與 70-94%。適量的鹼度添加與 SRT 控制明顯有助於 COD 去除
並促進硝化作用，但薄膜不可逆阻塞極易產生且清水清洗無法有效改善薄膜流通量。研究
結果亦顯示，無法通過薄膜而附著於薄膜表面之胞外聚合物質，雖會增加過膜壓力，但卻
可提升污染物之去除率。
第二年 : 本年度研究係建構ㄧ實驗室級連續式線上膠凝薄膜生物反應槽處理系統
(Continuous In-line Flocculation MBR)，處理化糞池出流水。本研究採用陽離子型聚丙烯醯
胺 (C-PAM) 為混凝劑進行測試。針對化糞池出流水，以聚丙烯醯胺濃度 0.1-10 mg/L 進行
瓶杯試驗，結果顯示濁度去除率由 37% 至 90%, TCOD 去除率由 29% 至 78%, SCOD 去除
率由 2% 至 72.4%；針對MBR槽中混合液，結果顯示濁度去除率由 32% 至 92%, TCOD 去
除率由 15% 至 76%, SCOD 去除率由 22% 至 84%。利用不同 C-PAM 濃度 (0 mg/L, 0.1
mg/L 及 2 mg/L)，進行連續式線上膠凝實驗，結果顯示，TCOD, SCOD, 總氮(TN) 以及胞
外聚合物質(EPS)之去除率皆隨 C-PAM 劑量增加而增加，薄膜阻塞也因 C-PAM 的添加而
大幅改善。
第三年: 本年度研究係建構ㄧ實驗室級海綿擔體-薄膜生物反應槽處理系統，處理化糞池出
流水。實驗結果顯示，系統對 TCOD 與 SCOD 分別有 75-97% 與 71-90%之去除率，系
統硝化效果極佳且對 TKN 有 98%以上之去除率。總氮去除率介於 50% 至 83%間。本研究
發現，添加海綿對於降低薄膜阻塞效果極佳，薄膜可維持約 110 天不進行化學清洗。SEM
研究顯示，薄膜可有效截留大腸菌，未來若進行水回收，可降低消毒劑的使用。

3addition, a slow increase of TMP was observed and the system could be run without
membrane replacement and chemical cleaning for around 110 days. The SEM result showed
that high density rod-shaped microorganism was found on the fouled membrane surface.
Based on the shape and length of the microorganisms, it was suggested that the
microorganisms are probably Escherichia coli. It means that the application of MBR system
for treating septic tank effluent can have a partial or almost complete rejection of pathogen
thereby resulting in a reduction of chemical disinfectant.

91. Introduction
1.1 Introduction
A lack of proper sanitation system is a common problem in developing countries, especially those
with rapid urbanization. Septic tanks are a typical wastewater treatment system largely found in
the developing countries owing to their simplicity, ease of operation, low costs. However, it is
found that the septic tank effluents often fail to meet the effluent standard and, when released to
the environment, cause contamination problems with surface and underground water. Therefore,
septic tank effluent post-treatment is highly recommended(1). The septic tank effluent polishing
can be conducted using membrane bioreactors (MBRs) which are reported to have small footprint
and reactor requirements, high effluent quality, good disinfection capability, higher volumetric
loading and less sludge production comparing to traditional processes(2).
However, membrane bioreactors have some problems, in particular membrane fouling and
concentration polarization. Operational and maintenance costs of the membrane bioreactor are
high, due to membrane fouling. Membrane fouling deteriorates the permeability of the membrane
and consequently increases energy consumption in a membrane bioreactor(3). Microfiltration (MF)
or Ultrafiltration (UF) has limited ability to remove small colloidal particles and dissolved
pollutants from water. In drinking water production, the presence of natural organic matter (NOM)
leads to disinfection by-product (DBP) formation, which is a public health concern. Similarly, the
effective removal of organic matter is essential in high-grade wastewater reuse applications.
Another shortcoming is membrane fouling, which is the transient or irreversible loss of
membrane productivity in terms of transmembrane pressure (TMP) and permeability(4).
Our intention is to add a more systematic collection of hybrid MBR performance data for septic
tank system to the existing literatures by performing a series of well-done experiment under
various operating conditions. We also hope to develop an alternative for the improving of
household wastewater treatment and water reuse in Taiwan.

A septic tank system consists of the tank itself and if it discharges to land, a drainage field. The
septic tank is a type of settlement tank intended to provide quiescent conditions for settlement of
sludge and the development of anaerobic conditions for decomposition of organic matter. Raw
sewage is fed to the tank, and settled sewage is discharged to the drainage field through the tank
outlet. Sludge accumulates at the bottom of the tank and has to be removed periodically(13).
However, septic tank effluent often fails to meet the effluent standard. Failure of conventional
septic tank occurs due to several reasons, including lack of regular maintenance, unfavorable site
topography and soil characteristics, poor design and construction, and inadequate capacity(10).
Such failures can result in nuisance odor and vector problems, as well as contaminate to surface
water and groundwater causing serious environmental and health impacts. Because of septic tank
effluent contains high concentrations of COD, ammonia, phosphorous, TSS, presence of number
and type of bacteria (E. Coli)(14).
2.3 Fundamental of Membrane Filtration
Membrane is defined as a thin film separation of two or more components from a fluid flow. The
advantage of membrane techniques include continuous separation, low energy consumption, easy
combination with other existing technique, easy up-scaling, and no additives used. The membrane
filtration is divided into three narrower ranges based on particle size as follows,
Microfiltration is the coarsest size of the membrane filtration classes. Its applications are
to separate suspended particles from dissolved substances. Microfiltration membranes are
classified by pore diameter cut-off (PDCO) which has the diameter of the particles in the range of
0.1 to 10 μm(15).
Ultrafiltration is used for separation of large macromolecules such as proteins and
starches and all types of microorganism, such as bacteria and virus. Ultrafiltration membranes are
classified by molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) which is defined as the molecular weight of the
smallest molecules. Ultrafiltration covers particle and molecules that range from 1,000 to 500,000
daltons in molecular weight(15).
Nanofiltration membrane retains solute molecules ranging from 100 to 1,000 daltons in
molecular weight. Nanofiltration membranes are classified by molecular weight cut-off like
ultrafiltration membranes or by percentage sodium chloride rejection like reverse osmosis
membranes. It can also reject contaminants as smal as 0.001 μm(16).
Membranes can be manufactured by a wide variety of materials which include inorganic
membranes (sintered metals and ceramics) and organic membranes (polymers). The inorganic
membranes have better chemical, mechanical and thermal stabilities, but have disadvantages of
being very fragile and more expensive than the organic membranes. The organic membranes are
widely used in water and wastewater applications because they are more flexible and can be put
into a compact module with very high surface area. The organic membranes can be made from
cellulose, and all synthetic polymers which have relatively good chemical, mechanical and thermal
stability tendencies, and also provide the membranes with better antifouling properties through the
13
However, the resistances are dependent on a number of experimental conditions, such as biomass
characteristic, membrane material and temperature.
Judd(2) concluded that the membrane resistance is governed by the membrane material itself, and
mainly the pore size, the surface porosity (percentage of the surface area covered by the pores)
and the membrane thickness. The fouling layer resistance is associated with the filtration
mechanism, which is then dependent on the membrane and filtered solids characteristics.
For low concentrations and at modest operating pressure, the flux variation shows a linear
relation with pressure. At higher operating pressures, the flux starts proportionally decreasing and
finally the relationship level off. This leveling off is due to the compaction of deposition layer
and densification of the membrane at higher pressures(9). Figure 2-2 shows a relationship between
transmembrane pressure and flux. It is observed that the higher the transmembrane pressure and
the flux, the faster the particles deposit on the membrane surface and to form a cake, then the flux
is independent of the transmembrane pressure and remains constant.
Figure 2-2 Relationship between transmembrane pressure and flux.(17)
2.5 Membrane Bioreactor
2.5.1 Definition of MBRs
A membrane bioreactor is a technology which combines the activated sludge process (bioreactor)
with a membrane separation step. So it replaces and in some cases complements the solids
separation function of secondary clarification and effluent filtration(9). Basically, a membrane is a
material that allows some physical or chemical components to pass through more readily than
others. It is perm-selective, which means that it is more permeable to those constituents passing
through it (which then became permeate) than those which are rejected by it (which form the
concentrate)(2).
The membrane support facility require equipment, such as pumps, for activated sludge circulation
and permeate extraction for constant flux filtrations, chemical storage tanks, chemical feed pumps,
air-scour systems and a back-pulse water flushing system. The constituents in the feed-water tend
to accumulate on the membranes increasing the inside pressure. Thus, the membrane flux starts to
decrease and the transmembrane pressure increases. At a certain level of decreasing performance,
the membranes must be backwashed and/or chemically cleaned(9).
2.5.2 Configuration of MBRs
The first general operation of MBR can be either configured in side-stream operation (as external)
or submerged in the bioreactor (as internal) (Figure 2-3). In the case of side-stream system, the
membrane is independent of the bioreactor. Feed wastewater enters the bioreactor where it contacts
with biomass. The mixture of feed wastewater and biomass is then pumped around a re-circulation
loop containing a membrane unit where the permeate is discharged and the retentate is returned to
15
wastewater treatment are as follows,
• Plate and Frame –The plate and frame membranes consist of two flat sheets of
membrane material, usually an organic polymer, stretched across a thin frame. The space between
the membrane sheets is placed under vacuum in order to provide the driving force for filtration.
Several plates are arranged in a cassette to allow for increased surface area and convenient modular
design. The membrane cassette is immersed in the mixed liquor and the separation flow is from
outside-in. For example, Kubota membranes have air induced liquid cross-flow along the plates.
This creates turbulence and hinders cake formation and subsequent fouling. The organic polymer,
polyethylene for example, has the required flexibility to move slightly in the cross-flow to allow
three-dimensional dynamic forces to reduce cake formation. The cross-flow of air also acts to
dissolve oxygen to and mix the contents of the reactor.
• Hollow fiber –Hollow fiber membranes consist of long strands, or fibers, of hollow
extruded membrane. They are most often of organic polymer construction and are applied much the
same as plate and frame membranes. The fibers are mounted to a supporting structure that serves as
a manifold for permeate transport as well as an air delivery system. Similar to the plate and frame
modules, air induced liquid cross-flow prevents excessive cake formation and increases the
lifespan of the membrane. The fibers are most often employed in the outside-in arrangement. A
vacuum is applied to the permeate manifold and this draws water from the reactor-side to the inside
of the fiber and out of the system. As with the plate and frame membrane, hollow fiber membranes
are also constructed in a cassette format to allow for the convenience of modular design.
• Tubular–As the name implies, tubular membranes are hollow tubes with the membrane
placed on the surface of the tube. Below the membrane surface is a supporting structure with high
porosity. In most cases, tubular membranes are made of inorganic material such as ceramic and
have a metal oxide membrane surface to provide a small nominal pore size. Tubular membranes
have a different separation driving force than the previous two. Rather than vacuum pressure, the
material to be separated flows along the membrane at high velocity under pressure. The velocity
provides a transverse force to drive the water through the membrane while leaving the larger
diameter particles behind. A tubular membrane could be used in the outside-in arrangement with
the feed water flowing along the centre of the tube and the permeate passing to the outside walls, or
the inside-out arrangement where the influent travels along the centre of the tube and travels axially
outward.
2.5.4 Advantages of MBRs
One of the major advantages of replacing a conventional settler with a membrane is its capability of
producing high quality effluent with a smaller treatment process footprint. In addition the MBR has
many other advantages over the conventional activated sludge (CAS) system. These include good
disinfection capability, higher volumetric loadings and high mixed liquor concentration (or low
F/M), independent control of solids and hydraulic retention times (SRT and HRT), which offers
better protection against shock loading, and less mixed liquor production(9). Considering these
advantages, MBR technology is becoming increasingly popular for wastewater treatment. The
advantages of MBR are presented in Table 2-3. However, the high operating cost associated with
the high energy demand and membrane replacement, is still a controlling factor for application of
MBRs(2).
Table 2-3 Advantages of MBR(21)
Advantages Details
High rate decomposition -Treatment efficiency is improved by preventing
leakage of undecomposed polymeric substances. If
these polymers are biodegradable, they can be
broken down with a reduction in the accumulation of
substances within MBR.

• Gel or cake layer formation is an extreme case of concentration polarization where a large
amount of matter has accumulated on the membrane surface due to size exclusion from pores.
• Pore plugging is caused by insertion of organic macromolecules (or extracelular 
polymeric substances, EPS) into membrane pores and some metal ions might function as a fastener.
Smaller bacteria can also be a contributor to pore plugging.
• Some foulants, particularly smal bacteria and soluble EPS (or soluble microbial product, 
SMP) enter the membrane pores and further build up on the pore wall, leading to a reduction of
total section area of membrane pore and eventually an increase of filtration resistance. This
mechanism is called pore narrowing. It has been hypothesized that once the pore size is reduced the
concentration polarization is amplified further, this causing an increase in fouling(22).
Figure 2-4 Mechanisms of membrane fouling (a) gel/cake formation (b) pore plugging and (c) pore
narrowing.(22)
Factors that can affect membrane fouling can be categorized and summarized into three different
groups including the membrane, MLSS constituents (and their concentrations) and operating
conditions. Figure 2-5 shows the connection between each of these factors and membrane fouling
and their interrelations.
2.6.2 Foulants
The composition of the MLSS with respect to constituents and concentrations is known to have a
significant effect on membrane fouling propensity and is correlated with design of MBR and
operational conditions. All MLSS constituents contribute to membrane fouling in different forms,
however, the extent of their effect depends on their presence in the MLSS(24). Membrane fouling
by inorganic constituents has not so far been adequately investigated; however, they may cause
severe fouling especially for industrial wastewater treatment. Inorganic fouling is usually due to
substances such as calcium carbonate that can cause scaling(2). Other constituents of MLSS
include suspended solids and dissolved organic matter (DOC). From largest to smallest, the DOC
of MLSS mainly includes biopolymers such as EPS which are bacterial products mainly made of
protein and polysaccharides, humic substances, low-molecular weight acids and low molecular
weight neutrals. MLSS also includes residual DOC from the feed water(25). During batch

irreversible fouling. Colloidal matter contributes the least to membrane fouling at this point due
to their lower fraction/concentration in MLSS as compared to the suspended solids and also
because some of the deposited colloids are removed by cross flow. At this stage membrane flux
decreases rapidly since all the MLSS components contribute to membrane fouling(27).
During the second phase, the flux decreases at a lower rate as compared to phase one since the
fouling in the first phase has decreased the flux and hence the drag permeation forces. The
irreversible resistance due to soluble matter reaches steady state at the beginning of this stage
since back transport and permeation drag of this fraction become equal. The fouling rate by
colloidal matter decreases at this stage until its resistance also reaches steady state at the end of
this stage. However, solids continue to deposit on the membrane surface and as a result, the
fouling formed at this stage is mainly reversible(27).
During the third stage, the flux decline rate decreases further until a sustainable flux is obtained.
Fouling is caused by two mechanisms: deposition of larger particles which occurs in the
beginning of this stage until permeation forces and back transport forces reach equilibrium; the
second fouling mechanism is the compaction of the cake layer due to the transmembrane pressure
which increases the resistance of the cake layer. This mechanism becomes more significant at this
stage since the cake layer has a greater particle concentration as compared to the previous
phases(24). Juang(27) reported that in the first 10 minutes of filtration in UF membranes the
dominant fouling mechanism is pore blockage by the colloidal matter which is slightly different
from Tak and Bae(24) who stated that in the first stage all fractions contribute to membrane
fouling with the soluble fraction having the highest contribution. However, both of these studies
found that during the final stage suspended solids are the main contributor to membrane fouling.
A number of studies have fractionated the MLSS into three different fractions including
suspended solids, colloidal matter, and soluble matter(28). In these studies, the fractions were
separated and filtered individually to quantify the contribution of each fraction to membrane
fouling. The results indicated which fraction contributed the most to membrane fouling, and
consequently the dominant fouling mechanism was determined.
Tak and Bae(24) found that suspended solids contributed the most to membrane fouling (72-83%)
due to their high fraction in MLSS. Cake formation represented 90% of total fouling and was
identified as the dominate mechanism. It is worth noting that these results were obtained from a
bench scale dead-end cell operated at a relatively low cross flow velocity (1.2 m/s) and high TMP
(100 kPa). Therefore, the permeation drag forces were higher and back transport velocity was
lower than in what would be found in commercial membrane configurations and therefore, the
contribution of each MLSS fraction to membrane fouling and correspondingly their fouling
mechanisms may differ from full scale installations. Tak and Bae(24) performed another dead-end
filtration trial with a lower TMP (20 kPa) and higher cross flow velocity obtained using a high
mixing speed (600 rpm) to assess the effect of TMP and cross flow velocity on the fouling
mechanisms. The cake layer formation and its resistance decreased allowing for higher solute
deposition on the membrane. As a result solutes became the main contributors to membrane
fouling and contributed 67% of the total fouling resistance while suspended solids and colloidal
matter contributed only 24% and 6% of total resistances, respectively. These results show the
effect of different operating conditions and the importance of hydrodynamics of the filtration on
the fouling mechanism.
Defrance(28) found that suspended solids had the highest contribution to membrane fouling.
Suspended solids, colloids and solutes contributed 65%, 30% and 5% of the total membrane
fouling resistance, respectively. They also observed that the sum of resistances found from
filtration of each MLSS fraction was higher than the total resistance due to the filtration of MLSS
compliment. Filtration of colloidal and suspended solids separately caused individual cake layer
resistances whereas in MLSS these fractions were mixed and the cake layer was made of their
combination which decreased their individual contribution to cake resistance. Defrance(28)
concluded the ratios obtained by this method were not perfectly representative of each the
components contribution to fouling. A more general explanation is that the effect of each of these
components on membrane fouling are interrelated and correlated, illustrating a drawback to these
21
higher concentration of EPS may increase the membrane fouling due to its higher attachment to
the membrane surface. However, the EPS composition may be more important than its
concentration with regards to fouling as the protein to carbohydrate ratio affects the degree of
sludge hydrophobicity and flocculation. SMP has two major components (carbohydrate and
proteins) with the former having a higher contribution to membrane fouling by pore blocking(26).
Leiknes(34) observed that with municipal wastewater when the colloidal concentration decreased
in the membrane reactor (due to operation of an MBR at higher HRTs), membrane fouling
decreased correspondingly. Their results indicate a correlation between the concentration of the
colloidal fraction and membrane fouling suggesting that decreasing the colloidal fraction may
decrease membrane fouling.
2.7 Controlling of Membrane Fouling
From the study of factors influencing the membrane fouling in MBR, there are several ways to
solve the problem respectively. Generally, there are three ways, process improvement, chemical
method and operation condition control. Bubbling wash, backwash and intermediate operation are
the most widely used technique to improve the MBRs process. Bubbling wash for submerged mode
and control cross-flow velocity for side stream mode already became necessary for the MBR
process. Backwash is a another widely used technique for membrane clean especially for hollow
fibers, which is pumping the effluent or air through the filtration pipeline opposite(35). Backwash is
demonstrated that it can recover some of the membrane permeation in MBR by getting rid of the
pore blockage and loosing the cake layer. Intermittent operation is to turn on and off the effluent
suction pump intermediately upon different systems, which could keep the system continuously
running for a longer time than constantly turning on the pump. This technique allows long-term
sustainability even when operating above the critical flux. Because when the TMP is during the
suspension of permeation, the force that holds the particles is negated, the particles deposited on
the membrane will be removed by the cross-flow(36). Sometimes, intermittent operation can
combined with backwash. The operation conditions of MBR, like HRT, SRT, MLSS and F/M
influence bunch of factors related to membrane fouling. Lots of studies are carried out, but there are
still only few consistent conclusions on how to optimize the operation condition and get a less
fouling system operation due to the complexity of the system.
Application of flocculants was accepted as an efficient way for solid-liquid separation in
wastewater treatment processing due to economic and environmental considerations(37). Adding
flocculants into the clarifier is an efficient way to improve the sludge settleability and effluent
quantities in conventional activated sludge processes. Flocculants could help the small particles
and colloidal in liquid to coagulation or flocculation into large particles, which can get rid of the
free particles in supernatant and make the sludge have a faster settle speed. Since the particle size
and organic solute are the significant reasons leading the membrane fouling, more and more
researchers are interested in studying the effect of flocculation on MBR performance(38).
2.7.1 Flocculants in MBR System
It is well known that the cake layer formatted on the surface of the membrane during the MF
process mostly limits the permeate flux. At the beginning, the membrane retains the particles, but
later the cake layer retains the particles. This bond layer provides additional resistance to the
permeate flow(39). Thus, the porosity of the cake layer is critical to the membrane fouling.
Flocculated particles can form a highly porous filtration cake. In crossflow filtration the
flocculation somehow prevent the deposition of particles on the membrane, which would enable a
higher permeate flux (40). Some researchers also find out that effect of flocculants on the filtration
process can be positive or negative, and a critical dosage does exist for certain system(41). The
adding flocculant may also adsorb on the surface of the membrane and wall of membrane pores
as well as flocculate the fine particles. The previous activity can lead to an increase in hydraulic
resistance(40). Various attempts have been done to achieve better membrane permeability by
addition of different kind of flocculant or coagulant into MBR for both industrial and municipal
23
positively charged units in the polymer.
Cationic PAM is used mainly as a flocculant for sewage sludge and various industrial wastes(52).
Nonionic PAM is used as a flocculant in solid-liquid separations, usually as an aid to primary
coagulants such as aluminum and iron salts. Nonionic PAM is also used in erosion control,
although in limited applications(52). Nonionic PAM is actually slightly anionic (1-2% charge
density) due to the hydrolysis of acrylamide units during the manufacturing process(52).
The majority of anionic PAM is used in water treatment and industrial wastewater treatment(52).
Since the 1970s there has been increased use of anionic PAM as a soil amendment for erosion
control(54). However, erosion control (agriculture) applications only account for 2% of all PAM
produced. High molecular weight (MW) anionic PAM (12-18 Mg.mol-1), with a charge density
ranging from 7 to 50 is typically used in erosion control(54). Anionic PAM is commonly produced
by copolymerization of acrylamide and acrylic acid (or a salt of acrylic acid)(52).
PAM is typically purchased as a dry powder. Dry PAM has active polymer concentrations of 75 to
90%, the remainder being water, processing aids, and buffers(52). PAM is most efficient and
effective if dissolved in water before application to soil(55). When mixing PAM solutions, PAM
should always be added to water that is stirred or agitated (water should never be added to PAM)(55).
The polymer solution must be rapidly agitated for at least 30-60 minutes for dry granular PAM to
be thoroughly dissolved(52). Higher molecular weight PAMs require more time to dissolve and the
solutions are more viscous(56). Anionic PAM with a molecular weight between 15-20 Mg.mole-1
forms extremely viscous solutions above 1-2% PAM concentrations(52). PAM is soluble in cold
water, and heating does not increase the rate of dissolution(57). Pumping liquid PAM solutions may
shear PAM molecules, reducing its viscosity and reducing its effectiveness to bridge particles in
suspension(54).

Figure 3-2 shows the schematic diagram of the laboratory scale immersed membrane-flocculation
hybrid system with septic tank effluent feed used for the second year project. The septic tank
effluent was pumped into the membrane tank (12 L active volume) at a constant flow rate of 40
ml/min and provided 6 hours hydraulic retention time. A tee fitting connected the feed and the
flocculant dosing tubes, and a small diameter tube section of variable length ensured adjustable
mixing times for flocculation. Compressed air was introduced for aeration via a soaker hose
placed at the bottom of the membrane tank. In continuous operation the suction pump was
stopped for 1 minute to allow membrane relaxation after each 5 minutes of filtration.

Figure 3-3 shows the schematic diagram of the laboratory scale anoxic-aerobic MBR system with
septic tank effluent feed used for the third year project. The experimental system has two
compartments with a total volume of 9 L, consisting of an anoxic bioreactor (3 L) and an
aerobic membrane bioreactor. The influent pump was controlled by water level sensor in oxic
tank to maintain the water level. The suction pump which connected to membrane module was
operated intermittently and the flux was adjusted about 19.67 L/m2.hr according to the designed
HRT of 6 hours. The hollow fiber membrane (Mitsubishi) is made of polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) with a nominal pore diameter of 0.1 µm and a 0.0915 m2 total surface area. Cubic shape
of commercial sponge with a dimension of 1.0x1.0x1.0 cm3 was employed into the anoxic tank as
a bio- carrier to approach the organic removal and denitrification. Sludge was withdrawn from
MBR tank to maintain sludge retention time at 20 days. Air pump was introduced for aeration via
diffusers at the bottom of the reactors. The air bubbles provided oxygen for biological needs and
hydrodynamic scouring effect to reduce membrane fouling. In addition, the suction cycle of 5
minutes followed by 1 minute relaxation was operated and the flux was adjusted according to

3.5 Fouling Index Measurement
The MFI of mixing liquid from MBR tank was determined with a test membrane (pore size 0.1
and 0.45 m) placed in a dead-end filter holder (membrane cell). The feed was conveyed from a
2.5 L vessel to the membrane at constant pressure (2 bars) provided from compressed air and
measured by a pressure gauge. Permeate flow was measured with an analytical balance (AND
GF6000) which is connected to the computer (PC) for data collection. Index values were
determined from post-processed data, and corrected to reference conditions. Figure 3-5 illustrates
the MFI equipment.

membrane cleaning was commenced by disconnecting the suction lines from the membrane
modules, and then the membranes were taken out from the reactor in order to remove the cake layer
on membrane surface by shaking in a 5 L plastic cylinder which contains tap water. After that the
membranes were immersed in a chemical cleaning tank for 6 hours. The cleaning solution was
prepared by mixing 10% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 50 mL with 5 L of distilled water. After 6
hours the membrane module was taken to remove cleaning solution by rinsing with tab water.

to Table 4-1, the average NH4+–N removals varied between 70% and 94% and the nitrogen
compounds in the effluent appeared mostly nitrate nitrogen at stage 5, indicating that nitrification
occurred almost completely. The results also showed that NO2− concentration in the effluent
remained below 0.5 mg N L-1.
Figure 4-1 Variation of COD.
Figure 4-2 Variation of MLSS and MLVSS
Figure 4-3 presents the variations of ammonium nitrogen in influent and effluent during the five
experimental stages. When compared stage 5 with other stages, stage 5 showed stable levels of
effluent NH4+–N with a relatively small range of fluctuation. Figure 4-4 illustrates NH4+–N
removal performance in MBR system. As shown in Figure 4-4, the overall removal efficiency of
TN was 76% with r2 of 0.89 in the linear regression and the highest ammonia removal efficiency
reached 98% when the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) was 0.41 kg NH4+–N m-3 day. Comparing the
NLR value with other researches, the NLR value of 0.41 kg NH4+–N m-3 day can be shown some
high since such a NLR value was attained by low biomass concentration about 4700 mg
MLSSL-1 at the 5th stage of this study.
33
this study, pH underwent a big drop from 8.5 in influent to 3.5 in effluent. It meant that the total
ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in MBR tank existed in the form of NH4+ which would not inhibit the
growth of NOB. Meanwhile, excess alkalinity with a range of 3-7 mg CaCO3 L-1 in the effluent
was measured at stages 3, 4 and 5, whereas no residual alkalinity in the effluent was detected at
stage 2. It indicated that the addition of 500 mg NaHCO3 L-1 could provide the alkalinity
supplement to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) for nitrification.
Figure 4-4 NH4+–N loading rate vs. NH4+–N removal rate
A series of screening tests were carried out to estimate the suction on-off operation mode and
eventually the on-off mode of 5-1 min was adopted. An important finding was that the water
cleaning operation could not recover the filtration capacity of the membrane fully, which
indicated the occurrence of irreversible membrane fouling even after physical cleaning in this
study. The membrane cleaning frequency is shown in Table 4-2. As shown in Table 4-2, the
cleaning cycle of stage 3 was 6.8 days, shorter than that of other stages.
Figures 4-5 and 4-6 showed the concentration variations of soluble EPS. Both protein and
polysaccharide concentrations in the MBR were much higher than the original contents and
similar to the trend of biomass variation. Moreover, the results obtained from Figures 4-5 and 4-6
apparently showed that MBR rejected mostly of EPS in this study.
Figure 4-5 Variation of protein
In this study, the fouling phenomena happened during the experimental period showed the
35
SCOD increased with PAM dosage, when the C-PAM was used as flocculant. Moreover, the
removal trends of the TCOD and SCOD are also similar to the turbidity removal for both A-PAM
and Non-PAM. These results indicate that the effect of various PAMs on sludge in MBR tank is
influenced by using C-PAM. In case of A-PAM and Non-PAM, the efficiency is not increase with
PAM dosage increase. This behavior suggests that floc breakup occurs due to charge reversal and
dispersion when there excessive or overdosing of flocculant.

Figure 4-11 The effect of PAMs on TCOD removal of raw septic tank effluent.
An important observation from Figures 4-13 and 4-14 is the linearity in t/V vs. V plots for the
mixing liquid flocculated with C-PAM of all dosages. A linear plot of t/V vs. V suggests that cake
filtration was the dominant filtration mechanism during the filtration test. However, a wide range
of particle sizes exist in mixed liquid, and therefore small particles which close to membrane pore
size are expected to block/plug the membrane at the filtration period (complete and/or standard
blocking) resulting in a sharp increase in the slope of t/V vs. V at the beginning of filtration.
Eventually a cake is produced on the membrane surface and a linear increase in t/V vs. V is
expected during the cake filtration period. However, no blocking filtration was observed in the
t/V vs. V plots for flocculated mixing liquid induction. The absence of blocking filtration may be
due to all particles in the flocculated mixing liquid were larger than 0.45m (membrane pore size
of this study), and thus standard/complete blocking did not occur.

Figure 4-15 Effect of C-PAM with dosage on MFI value.
Figure 4-16 Particle size distribution of supernatant fraction of flocculated sludge after settling.
From Figure 4-15, the results show that the values of MFI0.1 were lower than the values of
MFI0.45 except the values of without flocculation and flocculation with 10 mg/L of C-PAM,
respectively. Theoretically, the MFI0.1 should be higher than MFI0.45 since the membrane 0.45m
does not take into account the fouling effect of colloids(64). In the other hand, the membrane pore
size 0.1 m is able to retain all the components responsible for fouling including small molecule
(colloids and solutes) that are involved in membrane fouling. Therefore, the value of MFI0.1
should be higher than the value of MFI0.45. However, the opposite result was obtained from this
study. The results can be suggested that the higher MFI0.45 may be due to the size of particles in
mixing liquid after flocculation were narrowed to the pore size of membrane used in this study,
such particles are easier to be brought to the membrane surface and can plug to the membrane
pore. Therefore, this effect resulted in flux decay and higher MFI values for 0.45 m membrane.
In case of the membrane pore size of 0.1m, particle sizes after flocculation were larger than the
membrane pore size. Hence, the particles deposited on membrane surface could form a denser
cake layer than particle plugging. Javeed(62) suggested that the cake on membrane surface acts as
a second membrane for filtration. It is commonly accepted that particles smaller or larger than the
pore size can be retained by membrane to form a cake layer on the surface. This would explain
why filtration had continued for a sufficiently long period of time. In addition, these explanations

Figure 4-18 Effect of dosages on TCOD and SCOD removal efficiencies.
Table 4-3 shows the removal efficiencies of NH4-N, TKN and TN of the in-line flocculation
MBR system. It can be seen that the average removal of NH4-N was 95% at the first stage
(without C-PAM) and up to 99% at the second stage and kept the same removal of 99% at the
third stage. However, the effect of flocculant addition on TKN removal was not significant, all
the removal efficiencies were higher than 99%. In case of TN removal, it can be seen that the
removal efficiencies increased with dosage increased. The removal efficiency of TN at each stage
was 46%, 59% and 75%, respectively. It should be noted that there was no anoxic tank design for
this study to facilitate denitrification process. Normally, a possible route for TN removal can be
through bacteria assimilation by nitrification-denitrification procedure. The improvement in the
removal of TN through flocculant might be due to larger flocs were promoted by polymer
bridging which allows for anoxic conditions inside the floc then led to increase in denitrification.

In this study, the main components of EPS to be considered were protein and carbohydrate, and
the results of EPS in the suspended biomass are presented in Figure 4-19. It can be seen that, for
an in-line flocculation MBR operated at different flocculant dosages, the concentrations of total
EPS components decreased with increased dosage. It seems that the total EPS reduction was
mainly caused by the protein reduction, the carbohydrate content tended to slightly decrease. This
statement implied that there was a protein related biological nitrogen removal in the MBR system.
The principal mechanism for the nitrogen removal was assimilation and

Figure 4-21 Permeate flux of in-line flocculation MBR system during operation.
SEM images were taken to determine the morphology of the fouling layer on the membrane
surface. In comparison with the flat and smooth surface of new membrane (Figure 4-22), it can be
seen that the fouled membrane of the first stage (Figure 4-23), the second stage (Figure 4-24) and
the third stage (Figure 4-25) were covered with a fouling layer, which seemed rather irregular and
rough. The fouling layer that could be seen in the images of the first stage was mostly
compressed of the cake layer. Such surface of fouled membrane it could be formed by deposition
and pore blockage of complex materials present in the mixing liquid, which significantly decrease
the permeate flux or increase the TMP. In case of the fouled membrane of the second stage and
the third stage, it can be seen that the fouling layer on the membrane surface were seemed to be
loosely. From the results it can be indicated that the loose layer could be affected by C-PAM
addition, which can effectively flocculate or absorb small particles in mixing liquid by polymer
bridging. Moreover, the flocculated particles can form a highly porous cake layer and prevent the
deposition of particles on the membrane surface, which would enable a constant permeate flux.

4.3 Septic Tank Effluent Treatment by an Anoxic-Aerobic MBR Process
In this study, the system was operated at a total HRT of 6 hrs without sponge in anoxic tank for
stage 1. For stage 2, the system was operated at a total HRT of 6 hrs with sponge in anoxic tank
(150 pieces of sponge). The operating condition of stage 3 was same as stage 2 except the total
HRT of 3 hrs. Figure 4-30 shows the MLSS concentration during the operation period. The
results showed that the ratio of MLVSS/MLSS of anoxic tank and MBR tank is 0.71-0.94 and
0.84-0.97, respectively. As shown in Figure 4-30, the biomass concentration during stage 2 is
most stable among those 3 stages. An increase tendency of biomass with time was observed
during stage 3 might be due to the reduction of HRT.

Figure 4-33 Removal of TN
Figure 4-34 shown the relationship between the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and permeate
flux during the experimental period. It is apparent that the flux declined fast in the beginning and
eventually two times of chemical cleaning were carried out during stage 1. After sponge addition
at stage 2, a slow increase of TMP was observed and the system could be run without membrane
replacement and chemical cleaning for around 110 days. As for stage 3, similar result was
obtained as stage 2 that TMP increased slowly and a small change of flux was obtained during the
operation. It is obvious that the addition of sponge could reduce the membrane fouling. It is
speculated that the suspended biomass which adhered to sponge surface to reduce the
concentration of SS resulted in the reduction of membrane fouling. Basically, the matters cause
membrane fouling is not only suspended solid but also extracellular polymer substance (EPS)
existed in MBR tank and even the contribution from EPS to membrane fouling is much
significant in many cases. Unfortunately, the levels of EPS were not measured in the system for
the third year. However, the overall performance of the system showed that the membrane fouling
during the periods with sponge addition was not serious. Another aspect could be considered is
51
5. Conclusions
In this 3-year project, an aerobic membrane bioreactor (MBR), an in-line flocculation MBR
system and a sponge-MBR were conducted to evaluate their feasibility and characteristics for
treating septic tank effluent. The comparative results of three different systems based on various
parameters are summarized as follows:
1. For aerobic membrane bioreactor, the removals of TCOD, SCOD and NH4+–N varied
between 86-94%, 71-86%, and 70-94%, respectively. For in-line flocculation MBR, the
removals of TCOD, SCOD, TKN and TN varied between 94-96%, 85-91%, 99-100% and
65-85% respectively. For sponge-MBR, the removals of TCOD, SCOD, TKN and TN varied
between 75-97%, 65-96%, 98-100% and 15-82%, respectively. It is obvious that in-line
flocculation MBR system achieved the highest and much stable removal for the target
pollutants.
2. For aerobic membrane bioreactor, irreversible membrane fouling occurred fast and water
cleaning for the improvement of filtration capacity was ineffective. The addition of C-PAM
can reduce membrane fouling in the in-line flocculation MBR system. The improvement of
membrane fouling in anoxic-MBR system by adding sponge was significant, a slow increase
of TMP was observed and the system could be run without membrane replacement and
chemical cleaning for around 110 days.
