Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to clarify the 
friction characteristics in asymmetrical V and 
U die bending process. 
In the first year: A hard ball-soft plane 
contact model is proposed to model the static 
and sliding friction mechanism. The friction 
force can be defined as the composition of 
shear (shearing effect) and plough 
(ploughing effect) forces. The real contact 
area ratio is based on the indentation of 
hardness test. The lateral contact area ratio 
can be described as a function of real contact 
area ratio. Based on Meyer’s law and Hertz 
contact problems, the maximum contact area 
ratio can be described as a function of strain 
hardening exponent. Moreover, a limited 
condition is found that the strain hardening 
exponent must be less than 0.64 in the 
present model. Finally, the present friction 
model shows that the friction coefficient is a 
function of strain hardening exponent, real 
contact area ratio and maximum contact area 
ratio. The static friction coefficient would be 
always greater than the sliding friction 
coefficient in practical applications. 
Keywords: contact area ratio, friction, 
shearing, ploughing.  
 
二、緣由與目的 
The importance and complexity of 
tribology in metal forming has been 
extensively outlined by Kalpakjian [1]. Since 
metal forming causes severe contact 
interaction between tool and workpiece, the 
raising friction seems to be inevitable for 
affecting the forming process. Therefore, any 
understanding of friction must be based on 
an understanding of the contact mechanics. 
In contact, asperity interactions, together 
with adhesion, will always exist and will 
often be the major cause of friction. In this 
study, a simple contact model is proposed to 
model the static and sliding frictions. 
In the past, the success of the well-known 
adhesion theory established by Bowden and 
N
Ft=μ                             (3) 
where the tangential force 
 broken the friction 
junction, can be composed of shear force 
 and plough force 
 as shown in Fig.1,

ccrft AAF ⋅+⋅= στ                  (4) 
where the shear force term rf A⋅τ  is 
followed the part of adhesion theory and the 
shear stress can be assumed as, 
kf αττ =                           (5) 
proposed by Shaw [22], α  is the real 
contact area ratio defined as  where 
 is real normal contact area based on 
projected area of the impression rather than 
surface area and  is apparent area that the 
section area of ball, and 
ar AA /
rA
aA
2/2/ nuk Cn== στ                   (6) 
is the shear strength of material and uσ  is 
the tensile strength under tension, of course, 
the Bauschinger effect is ignored. 
For the plough force term cc A⋅σ , cσ  
denotes the lateral pressure and  is the 
lateral contact area shown in Fig.1. 
cA
The compression force in normal direction 
can be described as  where  
denotes the normal pressure. In general, there 
are two kinds of friction in practical 
application. 
rr ApN = rp

From Fig.1(a), the static friction 
coefficient can be shown as

In the same applied load, the sliding 
friction coefficient, shown in Fig.1(b), can be 
shown as

                 (8) 
In comparison of the first term of 
equations (7) and (8), it is clear that static 
friction coefficient always greater than 
sliding friction coefficient, ds μμ > . 
3.2.1. The real contact area ratio α : 
In the present work, the contact between 
rough surfaces is idealized as an indentation 
of a hard ball into a soft surface. Therefore, 
the real contact area varies directly with the 
normal load. For simplicity, the contact area 
ratio α , a measure of the effect of real 
contact area, can be described as a function 
of the normal load (or normal pressure) only, 
also confirmed by [14, 16, 23]. 
In accordance with the adhesion theory, 
the projected area of ball is denoted as the 
real contact area not the surface area. The 
real contact area ratio is defined as α  the 
ratio of the projected area to section area of 
ball. Then there are two kinds of contact 
shown in the hard ball-soft plane model, one 
is the normal contact area  and the other 
is lateral contact area . Then 
rA
cA α  can be 
described as

3.2.2. The lateral contact area ratio : rc AA /
  From equations (7) and (8), the term 
 shows a ratio of lateral contact area 
to normal contact area which can be use to 
measure the relative ploughing effect on 
contact. According to the geometry of hard 
ball-soft plane contact model, the  
can be described as,

3.3. The Meyer’s law in indentation test: 
Based on the present hard ball-soft plane 
model identical to the Brenell hardness test, 
the relationship of normal pressure and 
indentation impression can be obtained by

If the strain hardening behavior of plastic 
deformation obeys the n-power law 
, where npe cεσ = eσ  and pε  are effective 
stress and strain in tensile test, The stress σ  
represents the lateral pressure around the ball 
on the soft plane can be assumed and 
simplified as ( ) 2/nunn ncc ασαεσ ⋅==≈         (28) 
where σ  is various with α . For simplicity, 
the lateral pressure σ  is adopted as a mean 
stress cσ  applied on the lateral contact area 
, which can be rewritten as cA
)2/1(2/ nnuc += ασσ                (29) 
This approximation seems to be available 
in practical and analyzed works. 
 
3.5. The determination of sμ  and dμ : 
Combining the above equations of (10), 
(13), (23) and (27) into equation (7) for static 
friction and equation (8) for sliding friction, 
the following expression can be obtained.

From equations (30) and (31), it is found 
that the friction coefficient μ  ( sμ  or dμ ) 
is a function of ( )nf u ,,ααμ = . In 
accordance with the structure of equations, 
there is something in common for each 
equation that the first term  represents 
a common term. And the second term (as the 
first term in brackets) represents the shearing 
effect on friction, and the third term (as the 
second term in brackets) represents the 
ploughing effect. And it is seen that the 
relation of 
2/n
uα
ds μμ >  is always held for 
equations (30) and (31). However it must be 
mentioned that the value of α  should be 
less than uα  in practical and analyzed 
application. 
 
四、結果與討論 
The present model, hard ball-soft plane 
contact, for evaluating friction coefficient μ  
is discussed as follows: 
 
4.1. The ar AA /=α  and : rc AA /
The normal contact area ratio α  defined 
as equation (9) is used to measure the 
shearing effect on normal contact. Fig.2 
shows that the contact area ratio α  
increases as impression depth ratio  
increases. There are three stages in trend, the 
Rh /
α  linearly increases with a constant rate in 
first stage, increases with a decreasing rate in 
second stage and a large rate in final stage. In 
final stage, the α  will approach one as 
 equals one, reaching a sticking state. 
The trend is similar to the experimental 
observations such as [14, 23].  
Rh /
Moreover, the lateral contact area ratio 
 defined in equation (10) is used to 
measure the ploughing effect of lateral 
contact. Fig.3 shows that lateral contact area 
ratio , a function of contact area ratio 
rc AA /
rc AA /
α , increases as α  increases. There are 
three stages in trend,  increases with 
a decreasing rate in first stage, linearly 
increases with a constant rate in second stage 
and an increasing rate in final stage. Its trend 
is something like a distribution of creep 
curve. At the condition of 
rc AA /
1=α , fully 
contact at the sticking state, the value of 
 would approach the extreme value 
0.5 for the present model. 
rc AA /
 
4.2. The ratios uαα /  and uα : 
In accordance with Meyer’s law, the real 
contact area ratio can be normalized as 
uαα /  and described as equation (13). Fig. 4 
shows the effect of normalized contact 
pressure urp σ/  on normalized contact area 
ratio uαα /  in a theoretical manner. It 
shows that uαα /  slightly increases first and 
then turns to sharply increasing as urp σ/  
hardening exponent n. And the maximum 
contact area ratio uα  can be described as 
a function of strain hardening exponent n, 
, based on Meyer’s law and 
Hertz contact problems. There is a 
limitation should be noted that the value of 
n would be always less than 0.64 in this 
matter. Although this is something 
contradictive in practical applications, the 
value of n for most metals is less than 0.6. 
Based on Tabor’s work for Brinell 
hardness test, the lateral pressure can be 
normalized as 
2)2/( nu πα =
uc σσ /  which increases 
with α  but decreases with n. 
3. The friction coefficient μ  ( sμ or dμ ) is a 
function of strain hardening exponent n, 
real contact area ratio α  and maximum 
contact area ratio uα . And it obviously 
increases with α  under various n until 
α  reaches to uα , maximum contact area 
ratio. Although all the trends of dμ  are 
similar to sμ , the values of dμ  are 
always less than sμ .  
The present model can serve as a guideline 
for the evaluation of friction coefficient and 
improve understanding of the mechanism of 
contact friction in metal forming process.
