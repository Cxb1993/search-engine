I. INTRODUCTION 
Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) type controllers have found extensive industrial applications 
for several decades [1]. Despite the enormous interest that modern control techniques have sparked 
among academics during last three or four decades, PID controllers are still preferred in industrial 
process control. The reason is that PID controllers are simple, easy to implement, and comparatively 
easy to retune on line [2]. Recently, the design of accurate and robust optimal controllers for 
multiple-input, multiple-output systems has received a great deal of attention from the viewpoint of 
theoretical design. The well-designed controllers should meet the following objectives simultaneously: 
(1) disturbance attenuation, (2) robust stability, and (3) accurate setpoint tracking [1]-[3]. Since the 
three competing objectives cannot be evaluated in terms of the same measurement, the optimal control 
design problem is essentially a multiobjective optimization problem [3], [4]. 
Generally, the multiobjective optimal control design problem has been cast as a single-objective 
problem by constructing a utility function describing the relative importance of each objective [4]-[10]. 
Genetic algorithm (GA) is commonly used to solve the single-objective optimization problem of PID 
controller design [1], [3], [5]-[8]. Chen et al. [1] used GA to design mixed H2/H∞ optimal PID 
controllers, but the applied system is a single-input, single-output system. Krohling and Rey [5] 
investigated the same problem using GA as [1] with a different performance index, time weighted 
square error for a short settling time. Chen and Cheng [6] used GA to design structure-specified H∞ 
optimal controllers for practical applications, but their procedure needs prior domain knowledge, i.e., 
the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for decreasing the domain size of each design parameter. Kitsios et al. [7] 
used the GA-based method blended with multiobjective characteristics to improve the performance of 
the method [6]. Kitsios and Pimenides [8] used GA to design structure-specified robust-multivariable 
controller. Ho et al. [9] used a single-objective orthogonal simulated annealing algorithm (OSA) to 
efficiently design mixed H2/H∞ optimal PID controllers. 
The above-mentioned single-objective function is defined prior to the optimization procedure, 
which requires in-depth information concerning the various trade-offs and valuation of each individual 
objective. Generally, the information is not fully available in practice. An alternative approach is 
assumed that no information on the preference among objectives is available. The basic idea of this 
approach is to use the definition of Pareto concepts without having to combine the objectives in some 
way. Takahashi et al. [3] employing group properties of the Pareto set developed a multiobjective GA 
approach to the mixed H2/H∞ optimal control design using the solutions of LMI (Linear Matrix 
Inequalities) or BMI (Bilinear Matrix Inequalities) as an initial population of GA. However, the 
infeasible solutions of the PID controllers are found everywhere in whole search space. There is no 
guarantee that GA-based approaches can efficiently combine good offspring from parents by crossover 
operations to obtain a satisfactory solution. Therefore, we solve the three-objective problem of PID 
controller design by providing an accurate set of Pareto solutions using the multiobjective approach of 
simulated annealing (SA) instead of GA. 
Ulungu et al. [11] proposed a tool of multiobjective simulated annealing (MOSA). MOSA adopts a 
new acceptance strategy using a weighted-sum objective function to construct its accepted probability. 
In order to obtain a set of non-dominated solutions, MOSA must modify its objective weight for every 
run. There is no guarantee that a uniform spread of weights will provide a good spread of 
non-dominated solutions. Pareto simulated annealing (PSA) uses an automatic step to tune the weight 
of accepted probability [12]. The procedure of PSA is similar to perform many MOSA runs at once. 
The generation mechanisms of MOSA, PSA and fast simulated annealing (FSA) [13] use a 
generate-and-test method to yield a candidate solution for the next move that is difficult to explore an 
extremely large and multimodal search space in a limited amount of computation time and is not 
acceptable for many intractable engineering applications [14]. OSA uses an intelligent generation 
mechanism which can efficiently generate a good candidate solution for the next move by using a 
systematic reasoning method based on orthogonal experimental design [9], [15]. OSA performs better 
than FSA in solving large parameter optimization problems [9] and performs well in solving 
intractable engineering problems [15]. 
This paper uses a novel intelligent multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm (IMOSA) without 
 4 
for k=0, 1, …, u. Most of the conventional controllers used in industrial control systems have 
fundamental structures such as PID and lead/lag configurations. Such controllers are special cases of 
the structure-specified controllers. For the PID controller (ni =3 inputs and no =3 outputs), we have z=1, 
u=2 and a0=0, i.e.,

The PID controller has 27 design parameters. A PI controller with 18 design parameters is a special 
case of the PID controller where B2=0.  
III. IMOSA-BASED DESIGN METHOD 
High performance of IMOSA mainly arises from a novel multiobjective generation mechanism 
(MOGM) based on orthogonal experimental design (OED) [19]-[24]. Chou et al. [21] first used the 
OED-based single-objective approach to designing optimal grey-fuzzy controller of a constant turning 
force system using a Taguchi-genetic method. MOGM uses a Pareto-based scoring function to 
evaluate performance of candidate solutions in a multiobjective search space.  
A. The Used OED for IMOSA 
The used OED with three-level OAs in MOGM is described below. All the design parameters are 
generally assigned into N groups. One group is regarded as a factor. Let there be N factors with three 
levels for each factor. The number of total experiments is 3N for the popular “one-factor-at-once” study. 
To use an OA of N factors, we obtain an integer ( )⎡ ⎤12log33 += NM , build a three-level OA LM(3(M-1)/2) with 
M rows and (M-1)/2 columns, use the first N columns, and ignore the other (M-1)/2-N columns. Table I 
illustrates an example of OA L9(34) with M=9 for three-objective design problems. OA can reduce the 
number of experiments for factor analysis. The number of OA experiments required to analyze all 
solution factors is only M=O(N), where 2N+1 ≤ M ≤ 6N-3, which is much smaller than 3N. An algorithm 
of constructing OAs can be found in [9], [25]. After proper tabulation of experimental results, the 
summarized data are analyzed using factor analysis to determine the relative effects of levels of 
various factors, described below. 
Let Fj denote a value of a response variable (objective function F) for the combination 
corresponding to the experiment j, where j = 1, …, M. Define the main effect of factor i with level k as 
Sik where i = 1, …, N and k = 1, 2, 3: 
Sik ∑
=
=
M
j 1
Fj ·δj,                               (15) 
whereδj=1 if the level of factor i of combination j is k; otherwise, δj=0. If the objective function is 
to be maximized, the level k of factor i makes the best contribution to F than the other two levels of 
factor i do when Sik=max{Si1, Si2, Si3}. If the objective function is to be minimized, the level k of factor 
i is the best one when Sik=min{ Si1, Si2, Si3}. The main effect reveals the individual effect of a factor. 
The most effective factor has the largest one of main effect differences MEDi = max{Si1, Si2, Si3} – 
min{Si1, Si2, Si3}, i = 1, …, N. After the best one of three levels of each factor is determined, a reasoned 
solution consisting of all factors with the best levels can be easily derived. OED is a representative 
method of quality control and also can work to improve the move mechanism of SA [9] and the 
crossover operator of GA [24] more efficiently. Concise examples of using OED can be referred to [9] 
and [24]. 
Let n be the number of objectives for the optimization problem. MOGM operates on a 
non-dominated solution X with a high score F using OED to exploit its neighborhood and 
economically generate a set of promising non-dominated solutions by considering individual and 
whole objectives. If the whole objectives are considered, the scoring function F to be maximized is 
treated as the objective function and the reasoned solution Q is derived using Fj= F(Xj) where Xj is the 
generated combination corresponding to the experiment j, j = 1, …, M. If the individual objective 
function fh is considered only, the reasoned solution Qh is derived using the main effect hikS  based on 
fhj = fh(Xj) where h=1, …, n:  
 6 
there are M+n+1 evaluations of individual per MOGM operation. Besides, a good set of 
non-dominated solutions in E is also generated simultaneously.  
C. Design of Controllers Using IMOSA 
Designing an optimal control system is equivalent to finding an optimal solution 
1[ , ..., ]TmX x x= in a high-dimensional search space, where each point represents a vector of m 
design parameters. For convenience and simplicity, from the controller with (11), we denote 
T
m
T
nunnnz xxbbbbbaaX ioii ],...,[][ 1020210101110 == − ΛΛΛΛ         (19) 
as the controller parameter vector, where m=z+(u+1)× ni × no is the number of total design parameters. 
Denote Θ as the search space consisting of all admissible xi, i = 1, …, m. The structure-specified mixed 
H2/H∞ optimal control design problem is equivalent to finding an optimal X from Θ to minimize the 
objective function f in (10) subject to the inequality constraints (4) and (5). Chen and Cheng [6] used 
prior domain knowledge, i.e., the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, for decreasing the domain size of each 
design parameter xi.  The search space consists of all admissible xi∈[-20000, 20000], i=1, …, m 
[6]-[9]. In this study, we don’t use any domain knowledge to confine the search space Θ in order to 
demonstrate the strong search ability of IMOSA in efficiently obtaining a good Pareto front to the 
investigated problem. 
IMOSA is based on a traditional single-objective SA for solving multiobjective optimization 
problems.. In this study, the solution representation is 1[ , ..., ]TmX x x= that the order of xi in X is not 
critical because the different assignments of xi to factors don’t result in different reasoned 
combinations according to the property of OED. The scoring function F serves as a good objective 
function. The generation mechanism is MOGM which plays an important role in developing novel SA. 
IMOSA employs MOGM and F operated on an elite set E to efficiently search for a candidate solution 
for the next move and a good set of non-dominated solutions. 
For IMOSA, a multiobjective version of decision step of SA is additionally needed. If the 
non-dominated solution Q  dominates X and thus ( ) ( )F Q F X> , then Q  is accepted with no doubt. 
If Q  doesn’t dominates X but ( ) ( )F Q F X≥ , then Q  is also accepted because Q  dominates more 
individuals in E than X. If ( ) ( )F Q F X<  (i.e., Q  doesn’t dominate X), there exists some fi such 
that ( ) ( )i if X f Q< . Therefore, we define the acceptance criterion is to accept Q  with probability P( Q ) 
as follows: 
P(Q )=

f X f Qf X f Q if F Q F X

<⎜ ⎟⎪ ⎝ ⎠⎩
L
     (20) 
Let a variable Count be the number of trials for the same solution X, a constant Nmax be the 
maximal number of trials for the same solution X and a constant NEmax be the maximal number of 
solutions in elite set E. For a given plant P(s), we specify the bound W1(s), weighting function matrix 
W2(s), and the controller structure C(s). The proposed IMOSA-based design method is described as 
follows: 
Step 1: Initialize an empty elite set E with capacity NEmax, the temperature T=T0, Count=0, and cooling 
rate α. Randomly generate a feasible solution X. Compute f1(X), …, fn(X), and F(X). 
Step 2: Remove dominated solutions in E. 
Step 3: Perform an MOGM operation using X to generate a candidate solution Q . 
Step 4: Accept Q  to be the new solution X with the probability P( Q ) in (20). If X≠Q  (not 
accepted), increase the value of Count by one; otherwise, reset Count=0. If Count=Nmax (i.e., X 
is not changed in Nmax iterations), randomly select a non-dominated individual from E as a new 
current solution X and reset Count =0. 
Step 5: Let the new value of T be αT. 
 8 
parameters of IMOSA be NEmax=30, T0=150, α=0.97, and Nmax=30. The design parameters are assigned 
to N=13 groups and an OA table L27(313) is used. Each MOGM operation evaluates 31 individuals 
including M=27 OA combinations and four reasoned solutions. The stopping condition is to evaluate 
15,000 individuals. The three-objective Pareto front of IMOSA by merging the results of 10 
independent runs is shown in Fig. 4. All of the 24 obtained non-dominated solutions of IMOSA are 
listed in Table III. It can found that the values of f1, f2 and f3 for all non-dominated solutions are less 
than 1.0. All these solutions satisfy the constrains (4) and (5). All values of the tracing error f3 are less 
than 0.08 and most of them are less than 0.05. It reveals that the IMOSA-based controller is more 
accurate. 
The design problem is also solved by SPEA2 through 10 independent runs. Let the parameters of 
SPEA2 be pc=0.6, ps=0.2, pm=0.01, Npop=30, and NEmax =30. The chromosomes of SPEA2 are encoded 
using a binary string of 30 bits. The stopping condition is the same as that of IMOSA. In order to 
conveniently compare performance with some exiting methods which are not three-objective approach, 
we denote the parameters J∞ = (f12 + f22)1/2, J2 = f3 , and J=J∞ + J2  in the researches [6]-[9]. Fig. 6 
shows the Pareto fronts of IMOSA and SPEA2 by merging results of 10 independent runs and 
solutions of the single-objective methods Chen [6], Kitsios [7], and OSA [9]. The best performances 
for various PI controllers in terms of J are given in Table IV. It shows that the non-dominated solutions 
of IMOSA dominate all the solutions except that of the OSA-based method [9]. It reveals that the 
OED-based algorithms OSA and IMOSA perform well in designing controllers. 
From Table IV, it reveals that the robust stability and disturbance attenuation performances of 
OSA-based method are similar to those of the IMOSA-based method. However, the value 0.0473 of J2 
for the IMOSA-based method is larger than J2 =0.0374 of the OSA-based method because of the 
concentration of computation effort on the single objective J2. 
The obtained PI controller of IMOSA-based approach with J=0.6773 is as follows:

Using the best performance in terms of J, the system outputs of the IMOSA-based and SPEA2-based 
Pareto approaches are shown in Fig. 7. The simulation results illustrate that the IMOSA-based method 
can provide a very good solution with more degrees of freedom to the problem of designing 
three-objective optimal controllers with system uncertainty and disturbance. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper has proposed a method using a novel multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm 
IMOSA to obtain a set of accurate Pareto solutions to the problem of designing robust PID controllers 
for systems with uncertainties and disturbance. The optimal control design problem is formulated as a 
multiobjective optimization problem with three minimization objectives: robust stability, disturbance 
attenuation, and tracking error. The IMOSA-based method without using prior domain knowledge can 
efficiently solve the design problems of optimal control systems. A practical design example of a super 
maneuverable fighter aircraft system is presented to illustrate the design procedure and exhibit the high 
performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show high performance of the 
IMOSA-based method in designing multiobjective PI optimal controllers. The IMOSA-based approach 
can be widely used for designing various kinds of multiobjective optimal controllers. We believe that 
domain knowledge and auxiliary techniques can further advance the performance of the IMOSA-based 
method.

tracking error, d(t) is the external disturbance, and y(t) is 
the output of the system [4]. Without loss of generality, 
the plant perturbation ∆P(s) is assumed to be bounded by 
a known stable function matrix W1(s):

where σ (A) denotes the maximum singular value of a

If a controller C(s) is designed so that: 1) the nominal 
closed loop system (∆P(s)=0 and d(t)=0) is asymptotically 
stable, 2) the robust stability performance satisfies the 
following inequality

,1)()(2 <= ∞sSsWJ b                                    (3)

In this paper, the three objectives Ja, Jb and J2 are to be 
minimized separately. So, the design of three-objective 
PID controllers has the following objective functions: 
minimize J={Ja, Jb, J2}.                             (8) 
The order of the derived optimal controller is very high 
by using conventional methods, so that it is not easy to be 
implemented. To cope with this difficulty, we solve the 
three-objective PID control problem from suboptimal 
perspective. The PID controller (ni =3 inputs and no =3 
outputs) can be described as follows [4]:

The PID controller has 27 design parameters. A PI 
controller with 18 design parameters is a special case of 
the PID controller where B2=0. 
 
III. MOSA-BASED DESIGN METHOD 
 
High performance of MOSA mainly arises from a 
novel multiobjective generation mechanism (MOGM) 
based on orthogonal experimental design (OED) [12], 
[13]. MOGM using a Pareto-based scoring function for 
evaluating performance of solutions can effectively solve 
parametric optimization functions comprising lots of 
parameters [8]. 
 
A. The Used OED 
 
The used OED with three-level OAs in MOGM is 
described below. All the design parameters are generally 
partitioned into N sets. One set is regarded as a factor. Let 
there be N factors with three levels for each factor. The 
number of total experiments is 3N for the popular “one-
factor-at-once” study. To use an OA of N factors, we 
obtain an integer ( )⎡ 12log33 += NM ⎤ , build a three-level OA 
LM(3(M-1)/2) with M rows and (M-1)/2 columns, use the 
first N columns, and ignore the other (M-1)/2-N columns. 
Table 1 illustrates an example of OA L9(34) for three-
objective design problems. OA can reduce the number of 
experiments for factor analysis. The number of OA 
experiments required to analyze all solution factors is 
only

M=O(N), where 2N+1 ≤ M 6N-3. An algorithm of 
constructing OA can be found in [6], [15]. After proper 
tabulation of experimental results, the summarized data 
are analyzed using factor analysis to determine the 
relative effects of levels of various factors as follows. 
≤
Let Fj denote a value of the scoring function F 
(described later) for the combination corresponding to the 
experiment j, where j = 1, …, M. Define the main effect 
of factor i with level k as Sik where i = 1, …, N and k = 1, 
2, 3:

Fj · AFj,                                          (10) 
where AFj = 1 if the level of factor i of combination j is 
k; otherwise, AFj = 0. Since the combination with a 
maximal value of F is desirable, the level k of factor i 
makes the best contribution to F than the other two levels 
of factor i do when Sik=max{Si1, Si2, Si3}. The main effect 
reveals the individual effect of a factor. The most 
effective factor has the largest one of main effect 
differences MEDi = max{Si1, Si2, Si3} – min{Si1, Si2, Si3}, i 
= 1, …, N. 
After the best one of three levels of each factor is 
determined, a good combination consisting of all factors 
with the best levels can be easily derived. OED is 
effective for development design of efficient search using

and jhf  respectively, where i = 1, …, N, k = 1, 2, 3,

Step7: Add Q and Q1, …, Qn into E. Q  is selected from 
the best one of Q1, …, Qn, Q and Xj, j =2, …, M, 
according their scores. Note that Q  is not equal to 
X=X1. 
For an MOGM operation, the number of the scoring 
function evaluations is 2M+n which includes M 
evaluations (F1, …, FM) for combinations of OA 
experiments (Step 5), M-1 the evaluations F2, …, FM, and 
n+1 evaluations for Q, Q1, …, Qn (Step 7). 
 
D. Design of Controllers Using MOSA 
 
Designing an optimal control system is equivalent to 
finding an optimal solution in a high-
dimensional search space, where each point represents a 
vector of m design parameters. The parameters x
1[ , ..., ]
T
mX x x=
i are real-
valued variable. Chen and Cheng [4] used prior domain 
knowledge, i.e., the Routh-Hurwitz criterion, to decrease 
the domain size of each design parameter xi. In this study, 
we don’t use any domain knowledge to confine the search 
space. The search space consists of all admissible xi∈[-
20000, 20000], i=1, …, m [4]-[6]. 
MOSA is based on a traditional simulated annealing 
algorithm (SA) for solving multiobjective optimization 
problems. There are four choices must be made in 
implementing an SA algorithm for solving an 
optimization problem: (1) solution representation, (2) 
objective function definition, (3) design of generation 
mechanism, and (4) design of a cooling schedule. The 
choices 1 and 2 are problem-dependent. Designing an 
efficient generation mechanism plays an important role in 
developing SA algorithms. Generally, there are three 
parameters to be specified in designing the cooling 
schedule: (1) an initial temperature T0, (2) a temperature 
update rule, and (3) a stopping criterion of the SA 
algorithm. 
In the solution representation of the MOSA-based 
design method, the order of xi in X is not critical because 
the different assignments of xi to factors don’t result in 
different reasoned combinations according to the property 
of OED. The scoring function F serves as a good 
objective function of MOSA. MOSA employs an elite set 
E and MOGM to efficiently search for a good candidate 
solution for the next move. Let a variable Count be the 
number of trials for the same solution X, and a constant 
Nmax be the max number of trials for the same solution X. 
For a given plant P(s), we specify the bound W1(s), 
weighting function matrix W2(s), and the controller 
structure C(s). The proposed MOSA-based design method 
is described as follows: 
Step 1: Initialize an empty elite set E with capacity NEmax, 
the temperature T=T0, Count=0, and cooling rate 
CR. Randomly generate an initial solution X. 
Compute f1(X), …, fn(X), and F(X). 
Step 2: Remove dominated individuals in E. 
Step 3: Perform an MOGM operation using X to generate 
a candidate solution Q . 
Step 4: Accept Q  to be the new solution X with the 
probability P( Q ): 
P( Q )=

  (13) 
Step 5: If X≠Q , increase the value of Count by one; 
otherwise, Count=0. If Count=Nmax (i.e., X is not 
changed in Nmax iterations), randomly select a 
nondominated individual from E as a new current 
solution X and reset Count=0. 
Step 6: Let the new value of T be CR×T. 
Step 7: If a pre-specified stopping condition is satisfied, 
stop the algorithm. Otherwise, go to Step 2. 
If many final non-dominated solutions are needed, 
one may use an additional external set to store all the non-
dominated individuals found so far.

Consider the design problem of a longitudinal control 
system of the super maneuverable fighter aircraft in 
horizontal flight at an altitude of 15000 (ft) with Mach 
number 0.24, airspeed VT=238.7 (ft/s), attack angleα=25 
(deg), and pitch angleβ=25 (deg). The trim value of the 
path angle is β-α= 0 (deg) and the trim pitch rate is γ=
