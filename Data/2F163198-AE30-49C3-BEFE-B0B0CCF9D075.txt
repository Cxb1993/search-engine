1. Introduction 
The averages control charts (or X  charts) are widely applied in statistical process control. 
Traditionally, X  charts are maintained using a fixed sample size, a fixed control limit coefficient, 
and a fixed sampling interval between samples. Recently developed adaptive control charts that 
vary the control parameters from the process as a function of the process data, there have been 
shown to give substantially faster detection of most process shifts than the conventional control 
charts. One type of adaptive control chart is based on varying the sampling interval. Variable 
sampling interval (VSI) control chart was investigated by Reynolds et al. (1988), Runger and 
Pignatiello (1991). Another set of studies focus on varying the sample size. Variable sample size 
(VSS) control chart was investigated by Parabhu et al. (1993), Costa (1994) and Zimmer et al. 
(1998). Combined adaptive sample size and sampling interval control chart has also been 
developed and studied. Variable sample size and sampling interval (VSSI) or variable sampling 
rate (VSR) control chart was investigated by Prabhu et al. (1994), Costa (1997) and Zimmer et al. 
(2000). The idea of changing all design parameters (i.e., sampling interval, sample size and action 
limit coefficient) on a combined adaptive control chart has been considered and studied. Variable 
parameter (VP) control chart was investigated by Costa (1999). Tagaras (1998) gave a general 
survey of developments in the design of adaptive control charts. 
For the VSI, VSR and VP control charts, the actual number of samples taken in any given 
time period will be a random variable, and the time points at which the samples are taken will be 
unpredictable. The variability in the sampling intervals may be inconvenient from an 
administrative viewpoint and also undesirable for drawing inferences about the process. 
Consequently, Reynolds (1996a, 1996b) presented a modification of the VSI idea which may 
conform more closely to the natural periods of the process and be more convenient to administer. 
The chart is called VSI with fixed times (VSIFT) control charts. Lin and Chou (2005) extended 
“sampling at fixed times” idea to the other two adaptive control charts: the VSR with fixed times 
(VSRFT) control chart and the VP with fixed times (VPFT) control chart. The VSIFT, VSRFT and 
VPFT X  charts are inclusively called the adaptive with fixed times (AFT) control charts. They 
between two fixed times is divided into η  subinterval of length , where sh ηfs hh = . The choice 
of η  (or ) would usually depend on the practical consideration of how quick it is possible to 
sample again after the last sample has been taken.

The AFT X  charts are the modification of adaptive X  charts by applying sampling at 
fixed times, which employ warning limits and action limits to divide the chart into three regions: 
the central region, the warning region and the action region. Denote by ki and wi respectively the 
action limit coefficients and warning limit coefficients of the AFT X  chart with sample size ni, 
for i=1, 2. Denote respectively UCLi and LCLi as the upper and lower action limits of the AFT X  
chart with sample size ni, for i=1, 2. In mathematical expression,  
i
ii n
kUCL σμ += 0  and 
i
ii n
kLCL σμ −= 0 , (1) 
and denote respectively UWLi and LWLi as the upper and lower warning limits of the AFT X  
chart with sample size ni, for i=1, 2. Then 
i
ii n
wUWL σμ += 0  and 
i
ii n
wLWL σμ −= 0 , (2) 
where 0μ  is the mean of the distribution when the process is in control, σ  is the process 
standard deviation and . 21 nn ≤
The control schemes of the AFT X  chart is described as follows: 
1. If a sample point falls in the central region (i.e., (LWLi, UWLi)), then take the sample at the 
next fixed time using the small sample size (n1) and/or plot the corresponding sample point on 
the chart with wide action limit (i.e., large action limit coefficient k1). 
2. If a sample point falls in the warning region (i.e., [UWLi, UCLi] or [LCLi, LWLi]), then take the 
next sample after  time units using the large sample size (n2) and/or plot the corresponding 
sample point on the chart with narrow action limit (i.e., small action limit coefficient k2).

3. If a sample point falls in the action region (i.e., (–∞, LCLi) or (UCLi, ∞)), then the process is 
considered out of control.

where α  and β  are the shape and scale parameters, respectively. The mean of a gamma 
distribution is αβ  and its variance is . For 2αβ α = 1, the gamma distribution reduces to the 
exponential distribution with mean β . Let X  be the sample average from a gamma distribution 
with α  and β . Applying the moment-generating function of X , it can be easily proven that the 
sampling distribution of X  is also a gamma random variable with αn  and n/β . In the present 
study, we choose α = 4 and 1, and β = 1.  
In the present study, a comparative study is conducted to evaluate the performance of three 
AFT X  charts: VSIFT X  chart with η =5, (n1, n2)=(4, 4) and (k1, k2)=(3, 3), VSRFT X  charts 
with η =5, (n1, n2)=(3,13) and (k1, k2)=(3, 3), VPFT X  charts with η =5, (n1, n2)=(3, 13) and (k1, 
k2)=(6, 2.21). In addition, the choice of the interval  between the fixed times will usually be 
based on administrative or process considerations. However, the value of in-control ATS and 
out-of-control AATS depend on the  value. In order to let the AFT 
fh
fh X  charts with different 
 values have the same detection ability per unit time, the in-control ATS and out-of-control 
AATS can be divided by . Thus, the value of ATS/  and AATS/  are independent of the 
choice of . Table 1 provides the in-control ATS/ , out-of-control AATS/  and ANOS for

X  charts when the population follows the gamma or normal distributions. 
Table 1 shows that the VPFT X  charts have the better ability and lower sampling cost to 
detect the small process mean shifts and the VSIFT X  chart has the better ability and lower 
sampling cost to detect the large process mean shifts when the process follows the normal 
distribution. However, Table 1 is also shown that the in-control ATS/  values for the VSIFT and 
VSRFT 
fh
X  charts are significantly less than those under normality, which indicates that the charts 
produce false alarms too frequently, especially for heavily skewed distribution (e.g., for the case of 
chosen. Table 2 provides the out-of-control AATS/  and ANOS for the AFT fh X  charts where 
the in-control ATS/  is equal 333. From Tables 2 we can find that the VPFT fh X  chart has 
relatively small out-of-control AATS/  value, which indicates that the chart has better ability to 
detect the small shifts. Thus, under consideration of false alarm rate and the detection ability, the 
VPFT 
fh
X  chart is a better choice for non-normal populations.

5. Conclusions 
In the operation of AFT X  charts, the samples are always taken at certain fixed, equally 
spaced times, with additional being taken between these times whenever there is evidence of a 
process change. From the practical viewpoint of administration, the AFT X  charts are relatively 
easy to set up and implement.
