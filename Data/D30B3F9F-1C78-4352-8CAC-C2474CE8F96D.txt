double van der Pol system, double Ikeda system, and double Mackey-Glass system by suitable 
coupling. For these paradigmatic and important systems, the study will be extended and 
deepened. 
Chaos synchronizations are applied in various regions, such as secure communication, 
neural networks, self-organization, physical systems, ecological systems and engineering systems, 
etc. In this project, three new types of chaos synchronization with theoretical and practical 
importance are studied: 1. pure error stability synchronization, to improve the present defective 
method in which the maximum values of state variables appeared in error dynamics must be 
preliminarily calculated by simulations; 2. pragmatical adaptive generalized synchronization, to 
correct the absence of proof of that estimated parameters approach the unknown parameters; 3. 
different initial condition synchronization. By the traditional theory of chaos, the chaotic motions 
are very sensitive to initial conditions and separate each other exponentially. However, we 
discover that for two identical double Ikeda systems, lag synchronization, etc can be found for 
different initial condition, and for two identical double Mackey-Glass systems, various temporary 
lag synchronizations can be found for different initial conditions. These phenomina are 
contradictory to traditional theory. These should be studied seriously. The main parts of our study 
are: 
1. The study of chaos of two kinds of double Mathieu system. By phase portraits, bifurcation 
diagrams, power spectra, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions, the various chaotic 
behaviors of these systems will be studied. 
2. By pure error stability theory and elaborate Lyapunov functions, the pure error generalized 
synchronization method is given, proved and illustrated by two kinds of double Mathieu 
systems. 
3. The study of chaos of double Duffing system and double van der Pol system. By phase 
portraits, bifurcation diagrams, power spectra, Lyapunov exponents, the various chaotic 
behaviors of these systems will be studied. The regions and shapes of the strange attractors, 
hyperchaotic behaviors and fractal dimensions will also be studied. 
4. By pragmatical stability theory, the pragmatical adaptive synchronization of the above 
systems will be obtained. That the estimated parameters approach the unknown parameters 
are rigorously proved and illustrated by simulation for double Duffing systems and double 
van der Pol systems. 
5. The study of chaos of double Ikeda system and double Mackey-Glass system. 
6. Discover the rule of the initial conditions, for which the double Ikeda systems appear to be in 
lag-synchronization, anticipated-synchronization, lag-anti-synchronization or anticipated-anti- 
synchronization, while the double Mackey-Glass systems appear to be in temporary ones. We 
will try to explain these phenomina. 
 
key words: pure error stability generalized synchronization, pragmatical synchronization,

研究內容 
Chapter 1 
Introduction 
Chaotic phenomena have been observed in physics, chemistry, physiology, and many 
disciplines [1-3]. In contrast with the famous chaotic systems, such as Lorenz system, Duffing 
system, and Rössler system, nonlinear Mathieu system is less mentioned [4-9]. However, 
nonlinear Mathieu system is important and can be applied in analysis of the resonant micro 
electro mechanical systems [10-12]. In this report, the new autonomous and new nonautonomous 
chaotic systems constructed by mutual linear coupling of two non-identical nonlinear damped 
Mathieu systems are studied. 
Chaos synchronization has been widely applied in secure communication [13, 14], 
biological systems [15, 16], and many other fields [17, 18]. The generalized synchronization is a 
complex type of chaos synchronization and gives rise to extensive investigations recently [19-26]. 
The mixed error dynamics and the plain square sum Lyapunov function are currently applied in 
studying the generalized synchronization, but there are some shortcomings and restrictions in 
them. The auxiliary numerical simulation is unavoidable for current mixed error dynamics in 
which master state variables and slave state variables are presented while their maximum values 
must be determined by simulation [27-31]. However, the pure error dynamics can be analyzed 
theoretically without additional numerical simulation. Besides, monotonous and self-limited 
square sum Lyapunov function, eee TV
2
1)( = , is always used in most literatures [32-37], but the 
Lyapunov function can be chosen in a variety of elaborate and ingenious forms for different 
systems. Restricting Lyapunov function to square sum makes a long river brooklike, deeply 
weakens the powerfulness of Lyapunov direct method. Instead of current plain square sum 
Lyapunov function, the elaborate Lyapunov function is applied in this report. A systematic 
method of designing Lyapunov function is proposed based on the Lyapunov direct method [38].

topics. Generalized synchronization refers to a functional relation between the state vectors of 
master and slave, i.e. ( , )t=y F x , where x  and y  are the state vectors of master and slave. In 
the work of Ref. [52], the generalized synchronization is extended to a more general form, 
( , , )t=y F x y , where the “slave” y  is not a traditional pure slave obeying the “master” x  
completely but plays a role to determine the final desired state of the “slave”. Since the “slave” 
y  plays an “interwined” role, this type of synchronization is called “symplectic 
synchronization”1, the master is called “partner A”, and the slave is called “partner B”. In this 
report, we propose two types of new chaos synchronization, “non-simultaneous symplectic 
synchronization” and “double symplectic synchronization”. 
We propose the “non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization”, ( ) ( ( ), ( ), )t t tτ=y F x y , 
where τ  is a given function of time t , so-called variable scale time. The synchronization is 
achieved at “different time” for “partner A” ( )τx  and “partner B” ( )ty , therefore we call this 
type of synchronization “non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization”. When tτ = , 
non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization reduces to symplectic synchronization. When 
applying the non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization in secret communication, since the 
functional relation of the non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization is more complex than that 
of the traditional generalized synchronization, and cracking the variable scale time τ  is an extra 
task for the attackers in addition to cracking the system model and cracking the functional 
relation, the message is harder to be detected by applying the non-simultaneous symplectic 
synchronization than by applying traditional generalized synchronization. Therefore, the 
non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization may be applied to increase the security of secret 
communication. In order to achieve non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization, nonlinear 
control [53] and adaptive control are applied. In the work of Ref. [53], the induced matrix norm 
and the Lipschitz constant are obtained by auxiliary numerical simulation. However, they can be 
estimated theoretically by using the property of induced matrix norms [54a] and by applying 
1 The term ‘‘symplectic’’ comes from the Greek for ‘‘interwined’’. H. Weyl first introduced the term in 1939 in his book 
“The Classical Groups” (p. 165 in both the first edition, 1939, and second edition, 1946, Princeton University Press).

manner. In [69], chaotic behaviors of the fractional order “jerk” model is studied, in which 
chaotic attractor can be obtained with the system order as low as 2.1, and in [70] chaos control of 
this fractional order chaotic system is investigated. In [71], the fractional order Wien bridge 
oscillator is studied, where it is shown that limit cycle can be generated for any fractional order, 
with a proper value of the amplifier gain. 
In 1990, the idea of synchronizing two identical chaotic systems with different initial 
conditions was introduced by Pecora and Carroll [92]. Since then, there has been particular 
interest in chaotic synchronization, due to many potential applications in secure communication, 
biological science, chemical reaction, social science, and many other fields. The concept of 
synchronization has been extended to the scope, such as complete synchronization (CS), phase 
synchronization (PS), lag synchronization (LS), anticipated synchronization (AS), and 
generalized synchronization (GS), etc [57-61, 91-109, 114-120]. However most of 
synchronizations can only be realized under the condition that there exists coupling between two 
chaotic systems. Sometimes, it is difficult even impossible to couple two chaotic systems such 
as in physical and electrical systems. In comparison with coupled chaotic systems, 
synchronization between the uncoupled chaotic systems has many advantages [99-100, 109-114]. 
In this report, synchronization of two double Duffing systems whose corresponding parameters 
are driven by a chaotic signal of a third system is analyzed. The chaos synchronizations of two 
uncoupled double Duffing systems are obtained by replacing their corresponding parameters by 
the same function of chaotic state variables of a third chaotic system. It is noted that whether CS 
or AS appears depends on the initial conditions. Besides, CS and AS are also characterized by 
great sensitivity to initial conditions and on the strengths of the substituting chaotic variable. It 
is found that CS or AS alternatively occurs under certain conditions [59-61, 68, 73] 
Then we focus on the synchronization and antisynchronization of two identical double 
Duffing systems whose corresponding parameters are replaced by a white noise, a Rayleigh 
noise, a Rician noise or a uniform noise respectively. It is noted that whether CS or AS appears 
depends on the driving strength [57, 60, 73-74, 120-121].

nonautonomous chaotic systems in examples. In Chapter 5, the dynamics of nonholonomic 
systems is studied by applying the fundamental nonholonomic form of Lagrange’s equations. 
Two types of external nonholonomic constraints are studied for moving target pursuit problems: 
a straightly oscillating target and a circularly rotating target. Numerical results show that chaos 
exists in each case. By applying the nonlinear nonholonomic form of Lagrange’s equations, the 
dynamics of nonlinear nonholonomic system is studied in Chapter 6. We investigate external 
nonlinear nonholonomic constraint: the magnitude of velocity keeping constant. Chaos is proved 
to exist in each case by numerical results. Furthermore, Feigenbaum number rule still holds for 
nonlinear nonholonomic system. In Chapter 7, the non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization 
is proposed, and it is achieved by applying adaptive control. The synchronization scheme is 
presented, and chaotic systems with the same or different dimensions are illustrated in examples. 
We investigate the double symplectic synchronization by applying active control in Chapter 8. 
The synchronization scheme is derived, and both autonomous and nonautonomous chaotic 
systems are illustrated in examples. In Chapter 9 the fractional derivative and its approximation 
are introduced. And then gives the dynamic equation of double Duffing system. The system 
under study is described both in its integer and fractional forms. Numerical simulation results 
are presented. In Chapter 10, a brief description of synchronization scheme based on the 
substitution of the strengths of the mutual coupling term of two identical chaotic double Duffing 
systems by the chaotic variable of a third double Duffing system are presented. And numerical 
simulations are given for illustration. It is found that one can obtain CS or AS by adjusting the 
driving strength and initial conditions. In Chapter 11, chaos synchronization and 
antisynchronization are obtained by replacing two corresponding parameters of two uncoupled 
identical double Duffing chaotic dynamical systems by a white noise, a Rayleigh noise, a Rician 
noise or a uniform noise respectively. It is found that one can obtain CS or AS by adjusting the 
driving strength. In Chapter 12, theoretical analyses of the pragmatical asymptotical stability are 
quoted. Adaptive controllers are designed for the pragmatical generalized synchronization of 
two double Duffing chaotic oscillators with a double van der Pol chaotic system as a goal 
  18
without any control scheme or coupling terms, but with different initial conditions. In Chapter 
20, the chaotic behaviors of double Ikeda systems are obtained by replacing the parameters by 
different chaotic state variables of a third chaotic double Ikeda system. The method is named 
parameter excited method for synchronization which will be successfully used for uncoupled 
synchronization. Numerical simulations are illustrated by phase portraits and time histories. In 
Chapter 21, a new double Mackey-Glass delay system, which consists of two coupled 
Mackey-Glass systems, is studied. Numerical simulations display the chaotic behaviors of the 
integral and fractional order delay systems by phase portraits and bifurcation diagrams. In 
Chapter 22, a control method called parameter excited method is applied to control a double 
Mackey-Glass chaotic system and to synchronize two uncoupled double Mackey-Glass systems. 
By replacing a parameter of the chaotic system by a noise signal, its chaotic motion can be 
eliminated. By replacing the corresponding parameters of two identical chaotic systems by a 
noise signal, these two chaotic systems with different initial conditions can be synchronized. For 
some chaotic systems, such as physical and electrical systems, which are difficult or even 
impossible to couple, this method is effective and potential in practice. In Chapter 23, it is 
discovered that TLS, TAS and TALS, TAAS appear for two identical double Mackey-Glass 
systems, without any control scheme or coupling terms, but with different initial conditions. In 
Chapter 24, the lag synchronization of two uncoupled double Mackey-Glass systems is achieved 
via the parameter excited method. This method is accomplished by replacing the corresponding 
parameters of the systems with two lag noise signals. By means of the difference of the timing 
between two replacements for the first system and the second system, the lag synchronization 
can be obtained. The parameter of the first system is substituted by a noise at sec0=t , and the 
parameter of the second system is substituted by the noise at secdt = . In other words, the 
control schemes do not work synchronously for these two systems. Parameter excited method is 
effective and potential in practice for some chaotic systems which are difficult or even 
impossible to be coupled. Temporary lag synchronization, partial lag synchronization, chaos 
control and robustness of lag synchronization are also obtained by this method. Finally, the

Eq. (4.3) can be rewritten in the following form: 
( , ) ( , , ) ( , , )t t t= + +e p e q x y u x y& , (4.4) 
where : n nR R R+ × →p  and : n n nR R R R+ × × →q  are continuous vector functions represent 
the error variable terms and the state variable terms in the error dynamics respectively. 
In order to transform current mixed error dynamics into pure error dynamics, the controller 
vector is chosen as 
( , , ) ( , , ) ( , )t t t= − +u x y q x y v e , (4.5) 
where : n nR R R+ × →v  is a continuous vector function. 
Now the pure error dynamics can be obtained: 
( , ) ( , )t t= +e p e v e& , (4.6) 
Based on Lyapunov direct method [7], the scheme of nonlinear generalized synchronization and 
the procedure of designing elaborate nondiagonal Lyapunov function are described as follows:

then the relationship between ijλ  can be obtained.

Step 6. If Eq. (4.14) can be satisfied, the conditions derived from Eq. (4.14) can be obtained. If 
Eq. (4.14) can not be satisfied, i.e.

return to Step 3 and modify the controllers jv  by addition of j jk e , where jk  are constant 
gains to be determined. Repeat Step 4 and Step 5, then the conditions guarantee the validity of Eq. 
(4.14) can be assured. 
Step 7. Appropriately design jk  and ( )ij tλ  such that each condition derived from the above 
procedure holds. Finally the elaborate nondiagonal Lyapunov function can be obtained and the 
generalized synchronization is achieved according to Lyapunov direct method.

the initial conditions of the master and slave systems are the same as shown in Section 3.3. 
Let 2 ( 1, , 4)i i i ie y x x iα β γ= − − − = L , then the error dynamics can be obtained:

Highly Robust Pragmatical Generalized Synchronization of Double 
Duffing Systems with Uncertain Parameters via Adaptive Control 
 
12.1 Preliminaries 
A scheme is proposed to achieve generalized synchronization for two chaotic systems with 
uncertain parameters. By the pragmatical asymptotical stability theorem [1-2] using the concept 
of probability, we can prove strictly that the common null solution of error dynamics and of 
parameter dynamics is actually asymptotically stable.  
 
12.2 Pragmatical Generalized Synchronization Scheme by Adaptive Control  
There are two identical nonlinear dynamical systems, and the master system controls the 
slave system. The master system is given by 
),( BxfAxx +=&                                                       (12.1) 
where nTn Rxxxx ∈= ],,[ 21 L  denotes a state vector, A is an nn×  uncertain constant 
coefficient matrix, f is a nonlinear vector function, and B is a vector of uncertain constant 
coefficients in f. 
The slave system is given by 
)()ˆ,(ˆ tuByfyAy ++=&                                                  (12.2) 
where nTn Ryyyy ∈= ],,[ 21 L denotes a state vector, Aˆ  is an nn×  estimated coefficient 
matrix, Bˆ  is a vector of estimated coefficients in f, and nTn Rtutututu ∈= )](),(),([)( 21 L   is 
a control input vector. 
Our goal is to design a controller u(t) so that the state vector of the slave system (12.2) 
asymptotically approaches the state vector of the master system (12.1) plus a given chaotic 
  68
uncertain parameters, remains no answer. By pragmatical asymptotical stability theorem, the 
question can be answered strictly. 
The stability for many problems in real dynamical systems is actual asymptotical stability, 
although may not be mathematical asymptotical stability. The mathematical asymptotical 
stability demands that trajectories from all initial states in the neighborhood of zero solution 
must approach the origin as ∞→t . If there are only a small part or even a few of the initial 
states from which the trajectories do not approach the origin as ∞→t , the zero solution is not 
mathematically asymptotically stable. However, when the probability of occurrence of an event 
is zero, it means the event does not occur actually. If the probability of occurrence of the event 
that the trajectries from the initial states are that they do not approach zero when ∞→t , is zero, 
the stability of zero solution is actual asymptotical stability though it is not mathematical 
asymptotical stability. In order to analyze the asymptotical stability of the equilibrium point of 
such systems, the pragmatical asymptotical stability theorem is used. 
Let X and Y be two manifolds of dimensions m and n )( nm < , respectively, and ϕ  be a 
differentiable map from X to Y, then )(Xϕ  is a subset of Lebesque measure 0 of Y . For an 
autonomous system

dx L=                                                   (12.10) 
where Tnxxxx ],,[ 21 L=  is a state vector, the function Tnffff ],,[ 21 L= is defined on 
nRD ⊂  and 0>≤ Hx . Let 0=x  be an equilibrium point for the system (12.10). Then

Definition : The equilibrium point for the system (12.11) is pragmatically asymptotically 
stable provided that with initial points on C which is a subset of Lebesque measure 0 of D, the 
behaviors of the corresponding trajectories cannot be determined, while with initial points on 
CD − , the corresponding trajectories behave as that agree with traditional asymptotical 
stability.

Chaos-excited Synchronization of Uncopuled Double 
Van der Pol systems 
 
14.1 Preliminaries 
Chaos synchronization is an important problem in nonlinear science. Since the discovery of 
chaos synchronization by Pecora and Carroll [1], there have been tremendous interests in 
studying the synchronization of various chaotic systems [2–16]. Most of synchronizations can 
only realize when there exist various couplings between two chaotic systems. A major drawback 
of these approaches is that they, to some extent, require mutually coupled structures. In practice, 
such as in physical and electrical systems, sometimes it is difficult even impossible to couple two 
chaotic systems. In comparison with coupled chaotic systems, synchronization between the 
uncoupled chaotic systems has many advantages [17,18]. In this Chapter, the variable of a third 
double van der Pol system substituted for the strength of two corresponding mutual coupling term 
of two identical chaotic double van der Pol system, give rise to their complete synchronization 
(CS) or anti-synchronization (AS). Numerical simulations show that either CS or AS depends on 
initial conditions and on the strengths of the substituted variable.   
 
14.2 Synchronization between uncoupled double van der Pol system  
A van der Pol [19-21] oscillator driven by a periodic excitation is considered. The equation 
of motion can be written as: 
0sin)1( 2 =−−++ tbxxaxx ωϕ &&&                              (14.1)   
where ,  ,  a bϕ are constant parameters and s i nb tω is an external excitation . In Eq. 
(14.1), the linear term stands for a conservative harmonic force which determines the intrinsic 
oscillation frequency. The self-sustaining mechanism which is responsible for the perpetual 
oscillation rests on the nonlinear term. Energy exchange with the external agent depends on the 
magnitude of displacement |x| and on the sign of velocity x& . During a complete cycle of 
oscillation, the energy is dissipated if displacement x(t) is large than one, and that energy is fed-in 
if |x| < 1. The time-dependent term stands for the external driving force with amplitude b and 
frequency ω .Eq. (14.1) can be rewritten as two first order equations:

                                   (14.2) 
The double van der Pol system studied in this Chapter consists of two van der Pol systems with 
  84
the sum and difference motions of the original coordinate system, respectively. We can easily see 
that the (e1, e2, e3, e4) subspace represents the CS case, and the (E1, E2, E3, E4) subspace for the AS 
one. 
 
Choice A 
    Take kx3 instead of both a in system (14.3) and system (14.4), and take (x1, y1, u1, v1 ) = (3, 4, 
3, 4), (x2, y2, u2, v2) = (-3, 4, -3, 4) as the initial conditions of system (14.3) and system (14.4). 
For Fig. 14.3, k = 1 and for Fig. 14.4, k = 0.9. Fig. 14.3 and Fig. 14.4 show the time-series of AS 
(case (a)) and CS (case (b)) phenomena for different k, respectively. These simulation results 
indicate that the final state develops to CS or AS, depending sensitively on k in spite of the 
identical initial conditions in both cases. For Fig. 14.3, e4 (CS), E2 (AS), E3 (AS), converge to 
zero, while the other coordinates remain chaotic. For Fig. 14.4, on the other hand, only E2 (AS) 
converges to zero. 
Depending on the initial conditions both AS and CS can also be observed. To study how 
these phenomena depend upon the initial conditions, we change the initial conditions for fixed k. 
The results are shown in Figs. 14.5 and 14.6. Fig. 14.5 (a) shows that the differences e2 = y1 − y2 
and e3=u1 − u2 tend to zero. In Fig. 14.5 (b), the sum E4=v1 + v2 tends to zero. Comparing Fig. 
14.3 with Fig. 14.5, one can find that they have different behaviors. The only reason lies in the 
different initial conditions. Similar result also exists by comparing Fig. 14.4 with Fig. 14.6. But 
we have not observed the intermittent synchronization and AS states as declared in Ref. [22]. 
The simulation results are shown in Fig. 14.7 for different value of k. The solid circle “●” 
and triangle “▲” correspond to CS where parameter values k leads to synchronized behavior. 
While white circle “○” and triangle “△” indicate AS. The blank space means no exist AS or CS. 
We can see that the system (14.3) and system (14.4) tend to either AS or CS by using 
combination of different value of k and initial values. However, as we can see from Fig. 14.7, 
both cases agree well with the fact that the system goes to either synchronized state or 
anti-synchronized state depending on initial values and on k. When k = 0.8 ~ 0.82, neither 
synchronization nor anti-synchronization is found. 
 
Choice B 
Take kx3 instead of both a in system (14.3) and system (14.4), and take (x1, y1, u1, v1 ) = (3, 4, 
3, 4), (x2, y2, u2, v2) = (-3, 4, 3, 4) as the initial conditions of system (14.3) and system (14.4). For 
Fig. 14.8, k = 0.97 and for Fig. 14.9, k = 1.02. Fig. 14.8 and Fig. 14.9 show the time-series of AS 
(case (c)) and CS (case (d)) phenomena for different k, respectively. These simulation results 
indicate that the final state develops to CS or AS, depending sensitively on k in spite of the 
identical initial conditions in both cases. For Fig. 14.8, e2 (CS), e3 (CS), E4 (AS), converge to zero, 
while the other coordinates remain chaotic. For the Fig. 14.9, on the other hand, e2 (CS) , e3 (CS), 
E4 (AS) also converge to zero. 
Depending on the initial conditions, both AS and CS can also be observed. To study how 
these phenomena depend upon the initial conditions, we change the initial conditions for fixed k.

Chaos Control and Synchronization of Double 
Mackey-Glass System by Noise Excitation of 
Parameters  
 
22.1 Preliminaries 
In recent years, chaos control and chaos synchronization have been received a great deal of 
interests among scientists from various fields. The chaotic system performances are often desired 
to be avoided and to be controlled to achieve some specific behavior. In 1990, Ott et al. [1] 
utilizeed small time-dependent perturbations of an available system parameter to convert a 
chaotic attractor to any one of a large number of possible attracting time-periodic motions. In [2] 
a linear feedback controller is designed to control the Chen system. An algorithm for suppressing 
the chaotic oscillation in non-linear systems with singular Jacobian matrices has been developed 
based on the Lyapunov–Krasovskii method by Kuang et al. [3]. Linear feedback control and 
adaptive control algorithm are used to control chaos effectively in [4]. Many different techniques 
and methods have been proposed to achieve chaos control, which include sliding method control, 
impulsive control method, linear feedback control, nonlinear feedback control and ∞H  control 
method etc. 
Since the pioneering work was given by Pecorra and Carroll [5], chaos synchronization 
[6-12] has become an important topic in physical engineering sciences. Many effective control 
schemes have been developed in a variety of fields, such as parameters adaptive control [13-21], 
observer based control [22, 23], variable structure control [24, 25], active control [26-35], 
nonlinear control [36-38] and so on. The applications of chaos synchronization are implemented 
extensively in secure communications, chemical, physical, and biological systems and neural 
networks.

values )2.0,2.0(),( 2010 =yy . We use the parameter excited method to synchronize these two 
identical double Mackey-Glass chaotic systems with different initial conditions. By replacing the 
corresponding parameters of these two chaotic systems by a noise signal, the synchronizations are 
achieved successfully in major cases. 
 
22.3 Numerical simulations of chaos control 
In Sections 22.3 and 22.4, the numerical simulations which carried out by Simulink 
environment of MATLAB are presented. The corresponding parameter is replaced by Gaussian 
noise, Rayleigh noise, Rician noise and uniform noise respectively and the noise strength is 
adjustable. With suitable noise strengths, the chaotic motions of double Mackey-Glass system can 
be eliminated, and the motions converge to zero. 
 
22.3.1 Gaussian noise

is called Gaussian distributed noise, where μ  is the mean and 2σ  is the variance of the 
random variable. The Simulink Communication toolbox provides the Gaussian noise generator 
block. In our case, we take the mean as 0 and the variance as 1. Therefore, μ  is a constant 
vector and K  is a constant matrix. 
Parameter b  and parameter r  of Eq. (22.1) are substituted respectively by 11Fp  where 
1F  is Gaussian noise and 1p  is the noise strength. When b  is replaced, the chaotic behavior is 
suppressed and the system is asymptotically stable at the origin as 6.01 <p . Fig 22.2 shows the 
time histories of the variables 1x  and 2x  with noise strength 5.01 =p . When r  is replaced, 
the trajectories gradually increase unbounded when 5.01 >p  and chaotic behavior cannot 
eliminated with any noise strength. 
 
  96
    Parameter r  of Eq. (22.1) is substituted by 33Fp  where 3F  is Rician noise and 3p  is 
the noise strength. The chaotic motion of the system can be eliminated as 08.03 >p . Numerical 
simulation, illustrated in Fig. 22.4, shows that the motion is asymptotically stabilized to the 
equilibrium point (0,0,0) by the noise excitation method with noise strength 1.03 =p .

The Simulink Communication toolbox provides the Rician noise generator block. We specify 
lower bound 0=c  and upper bound 1=d  in the case. 
    Parameter r  of Eq. (22.1) is substituted by 44Fp  where 4F  is uniform noise and 4p  is 
the noise strength. When 4.04 >p , the chaotic motion can be eliminated and the system is 
asymptotically stable at the origin. Fig. 22.5 illustrates the time histories of the states of the 
system with noise strength 5.04 =p . 
 
22.4 Numerical simulations of chaos synchronizations 
In this section, we use the parameter excited method by replacing the corresponding 
parameters by Gaussian noise, Rayleigh noise, Rician noise and uniform noise respectively, to 
synchronize two uncoupled double Mackey-Glass systems. The system parameter b and r are 
substituted by noise respectively and the noise strength is variable. The error states which are 
defined as iii yxe −= , )2,1( =i  will converge to zero as ∞→t  when the strength is chosen 
properly. The results of simulations show that the synchronizations are successfully achieved via 
  98
with 16.02 =p  are shown in Fig. 22.11. Besides, in a small range of 0.08~0.1, the systems show 
temporary chaos synchronization. Fig.22.12 shows error 21,ee  and the time histories of the state 
variables with noise strength 08.02 =p . For the values of 2p other than these ranges, chaos 
synchronization cannot be obtained. 
 
22.4.3 Rician noise 
We replace two corresponding parameter b  and two corresponding parameters r  of the 
system (22.1) and (22.2) with 33Fp  respectively where 3F  is Rician noise and 3p  is the noise 
strength. In the case of b , we assume that the noise strength  
ip 25.03 = ,  50,...,2,1=i                                                (22.11) 
As shown in Fig. 22.12, the Rician noise is more effective than Rayleigh noise. In the range of 
5.1225.0 3 ≤≤ p , the synchronization is achieved except 3p  takes 1.25, 4.75, 11.25, 12 and 
12.25. Fig. 22.14 shows the error states and the phase portraits of the systems with noise strength 
53 =p . 
    In the case of r , synchronization is obtained only when 08.006.0 3 ≤≤ p . Error 1e , 2e  
and the phase portraits of the systems with noise strength 07.03 =p  are given in Fig. 22.15. The 
error states oscillate when 06.03 <p  and the state variables of the system converge to zero as 
08.03 >p . Chaos synchronization cannot obtain for the values of 2p other than 0.105~0.16. 
 
22.4.4 Uniform noise 
We replace two corresponding parameters b  and two corresponding parameters  r  of the 
system (22.1) and (22.2) by 44Fp  respectively where 4F  is uniform noise and 4p  is the noise 
strength. In the case of b , we assume that the noise strength  
ip 25.03 = ,  50,...,2,1=i                                                (22.13) 
As shown in Fig. 22.16, the synchronization is achieved except for a few 4p  in the range of 
5.1225.0 4 ≤≤ p . Fig. 22.17 shows the error states and the phase portraits of the systems with 
noise strength 25.104 =p .

Temporary Lag and Anticipated Synchronization and 
Anti-synchronization of Uncoupled Time-delayed 
Chaotic Systems 
 
23.1 Preliminaries 
    Since the pioneering work was investigated by Pecorra and Carroll [1], Chaos 
synchronization [2-8] has become an important topic in engineering science. Many effective 
control schemes have been developed in a variety of fields, such as parameters adaptive control 
[9-17], observer based control [18, 19], variable structure control [20, 21], active control [22-26], 
anti-control [27-33], nonlinear control [34-36] and so on. The applications of chaos 
synchronization are implemented extensively including secure communications, chemical, 
physical, and biological systems and neural networks.  
    Recently, the concept of synchronization has been extended to the scope, such as generalized, 
lag, anticipating, phase and anti-synchronization. The basic synchronization called complete 
synchronization is that the state vectors of the first system )(tx  is equal to the state vectors of 
the second system )(ty : )()( txty = . The lag synchronization [37] is that the state vector of the 
second system y  delay that of driver system x : )()( Ttxty −= with positive T . If T  is 
negative, we have anticipated synchronization. If the synchronizations are temporary and 
intermittent, they are called temporary lag synchronization (TLS) and temporary anticipated 
synchronization (TAS). Lag anti-synchronization [38] means )()( Ttxty −−= . When T  is 
negative, we have anticipated anti-synchronization. If they are temporary and intermittent, they 
are called temporary lag anti-synchronization (TLAS) and temporary anticipated 
anti-synchronization (TAAS) [39]. 
It is discovered that TLS, TAS and TALS, TAAS appear for two identical double 
  114
Mackey-Glass systems

The system is a model of blood production of patients with leukemia. The variables 1x , 2x  are 
the concentration of the mature blood cells in the blood, and τ1x , τ2x  are presented the request 
of the cells which is made after τ  seconds, i.e. )( ττ −= txx ii , )2,1( =i . The time delay τ  
indicates the difference between the time of cellular production in the bone marrow and of the 
release of mature cells into the blood. According to the observations, the time τ  is large in the 
patients with leukemia and the concentration of the blood cells becomes oscillatory.   
In our study, we keep the delay time fixed in 20 second ( 20=τ ) and the parameters are 
shown as follow: 2.0=b , 1.0=r , and 10=n . The system is chaotic in foregoing conditions as 
shown in Fig. 23.1 [41]. All the numerical simulations are implemented by Matlab. The initial 
conditions we choose are constant, i.e. the variable )( θ+tx  maintains a constant for 
all )0,( τθ −∈ . 
    Fig.23.2 shows the time histories of double Mackey-Glass system with initial conditions 
),( 2010 xx = (0.001, 0.001), ),( 2010 yy = (0.0015, 0.0015) respectively. Because the similar 
characteristics exist for 1x , 1y  and for 2x , 2y , we only draw the time histories of 1x , 1y  (Fig. 
23.2 (a)~(f)) and the time histories of error, 111 yxe jT −=  (Fig. 23.2 (g)~(l)). From Fig. 23.2, the 
temporary lag and anticipated synchronizations appear intermittently. Lag synchronizations are 
more than anticipated synchronization. In Table I, we marshal the length of the temporary lag

23.4 The lag and anticipated anti-synchronization of two identical double 
Mackey-Glass systems 
    In this section, we add one, two, three or four minus sign to the initial conditions, TLS and 
TLAS occur alternatively. 
    Table III shows the results of the simulations. There are interesting phenomena. The minus 
sign makes the original time history inverse but with same magnitude, i.e. two time histories are 
symmetric to the abscissa. From Case 1~4, it is found that the inverse effect only appears when 
the initial condition 10x  or 10y  is negative. On the contrary, it does not work for 20x  and 20y . 
The trajectories of 1x  and 2x  are upside down as 10x  is negative, and the trajectories of 1y  
and 2y  show the similar characteristics with negative 10y . In these two cases, the lag 
anti-synchronizations exist. Because the negative initial conditions 20x , 20y  have no influence 
on the systems, there are still lag synchronizations in Case 2 and 4. Case 5~9 show the results 
where there are two negative initial conditions at the same time. In Case 5 and 7, only the 
inverses of 1x  and 2x  occur, so two systems are in lag anti-synchronization. Case 6 and 9 
maintain lag synchronization because both trajectories are opposite in the former case and no

where 1x , 2x , 1y , 2y  are state variables and )( ττ −= txx ii , )( ττ −= tyy ii  )2,1( =i , τ  is a 
time delay, and b , 1r , 2r , n , k  are constant parameters. Double Mackey-Glass system is a 
generalized system of a well-known blood production model established by Mackey and Glass [39]. 
For the patient with leukemia, the concentration of the blood can vary chaotically because of the 
excessively large time delay τ . 
   The parameters and the time delay of Eq. (24.1) and (24.2) are chosen as follows: 2.0=b , 
1.021 == rr , 10=n , 1=k and 20=τ . The initial values are given as )1.0,1.0(),( 2010 =xx  and 
)2.0,2.0(),( 2010 =yy . Both systems are chaotic in foregoing conditions [40] as shown in Fig. 24.1. 
The lag synchronization is obtained by using the control scheme called parameter excited method. 
The designated parameter is replaced by a noise signal, but there exist a time difference between 
two replacements for the first system and for the second system. The illustrations will show that the 
system (24.1) and system (24.2) are in lag synchronization. 
 
24.3 Numerical simulation results of lag synchronizations 
All simulations are carried out by Simulink environment of MATLAB. By replacing the 
corresponding parameter b , 1r , 2r  or k  by a Rayleigh noise signal respectively, lag 
  130
method is an effective chaos control method which controls the chaotic states of systems (24.1) 
and (24.2) to zero. No lag synchronization is found in the rest range of the noise strength. 
    Next, we replace two corresponding parameters 1r  and k  of the systems (24.1) and (24.2) 
by pN  where N  is a Rayleigh noise and p  is the noise strength. As the noise strength in the 
range of 05.002.0 ≤≤ p  and 16.0105.0 ≤≤ p , the lag synchronization can be accomplished. 
Fig. 24.7 and Fig. 24.8 show the error states and the time histories of the states variables of two 
systems with noise strengths 03.0=p  and 12.0=p respectively. When the noise strength p is 
taken between two foregoing  ranges, 105.005.0 << p , a phenomenon called temporary lag 
synchronization (TLS) is found [41]. Fig. 24.9 shows the error states and the time histories of the 
state variables with 103.0=p . When the noise strength decreases as 01.0≤p , the error state 
1e  converge to zero and the lag synchronization for 1x  and 1y  is achieved. However, the error 
state 2e  is chaotic and the lag synchronization for 2x  and 2y can not be obtained. This 
phenomenon is called partial lag synchronization. The error states 21,ee and the time histories of 
11, yx  are shown in Fig. 24.10. When the noise strength increases to 16.0>p , the trajectories of 
11, yx  approach to zero and the difference between 2x  and 2y is chaotic. The error states 
21,ee and the time histories of 11, yx  are shown in Fig. 24.11.  
    In order to verify the robustness of lag synchronization, a small disturbance tyx cos)( 11 −ε  
is added in two double Mackey-Glass systems:

extended to nonholonomic systems and nonlinear nonholonomic system. By applying the 
fundamental nonholonomic form of Lagrange’s equations, the chaos of two nonholonomic 
moving target pursuit systems is studied in Chapter 5, in which nonholonomic pursuit system 
with a straightly oscillating target and nonholonomic pursuit system with a circularly rotating 
target are investigated. In Chapter 6, chaos of nonlinear nonholonomic problem, the magnitude of 
velocity keeping constant, is studied by applying the nonlinear nonholonomic form of Lagrange’s 
equations. Complete identification of chaotic phenomena is obtained in nonlinear nonholonomic 
system by Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, Poincaré maps, and bifurcation diagrams. 
Futhermore, the Feigenbaum number rule still holds for nonlinear nonholonomic system. 
In Chapter 7, the non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization with variable scale time, 
( ) ( ( ), ( ), )t t tτ=y F x y , is studied. By applying adaptive control, the non-simultaneous symplectic 
synchronization is achieved and the estimated Lipschitz constant is much less than the Lipschitz 
constant obtained by applying nonlinear control. This result in the reduction of the gain of the 
controller, i.e. the cost of controller is reduced. The simulation results show that the proposed 
scheme is feasible for both autonomous and nonautonomous chaotic systems, whether the 
dimensions of ( )τx  and ( )ty  are the same or not. Furthermore, when applying the 
non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization in secret communication, since the functional 
relation of the non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization is more complex than that of 
traditional generalized synchronization, and cracking the variable scale time τ  is an extra task 
for the attackers in addition to cracking the system model and cracking the functional relation, the 
non-simultaneous symplectic synchronization may be applied to increase the security of secret 
communication. 
In Chapter 8, the double symplectic synchronization, ( , ) ( , , )t=G x y F x y , is studied. It is an 
extension of symplectic synchronization, ( , , )t=y F x y . By applying active control, the double 
symplectic synchronization is achieved. By simulation results, it is shown that the proposed 
scheme is effective and feasible for both autonomous and nonautonomous chaotic systems. 
Furthermore, the double symplectic synchronization may be applied to increase the security of 
  146
and the lowest total order for chaos existence in the system is found to be 0.4. Thirty nonchaotic 
cases are found. 
In Chapter 14, the variable with adjustable strength of a third double van der Pol system 
substituted for the strength of two corresponding mutual coupling terms of two uncoupled 
identical chaotic double van der Pol system, gives rise to their synchronization or 
anti-synchronization. Both CS and AS can be achived by adjusting the strength of the substituted 
variable and the initial conditions. 
In Chapter 15, complete synchronization and antisynchronization scheme based on the 
substitution of two same parameters in two identical chaotic double van der Pol systems by a 
white noise, a Rayleigh noise respectively. For the white noise case and Rayleigh noise case, CS 
and AS are obtained for different noise strengths and initial conditions. Numerical simulations 
show that whether CS or AS occurs is sensitive to the noise strength. 
In Chapter 16, controling chaotic systems to different systems is studied by new pragmatical 
adaptive control method. The pragmatical asymptotical stability theorem fills the vacancy 
between the actual asymptotical stability and mathematical asymptotical stability, the conditions 
of the Lyapunov function for pragmatical asymptotical stability are lower than that for traditional 
asymptotical stability. By using this theorem, with the same conditions for Lyapunov function, 
0V > , 0V ≤& , as that in current scheme of adaptive chaos control, we not only obtain the 
adaptive control of chaotic systems but so prove that the estimated parameters approach the 
uncertain values. Traditional chaos control is limited for the same system. This method enlarges 
the function of chaos control. We can control a chaotic system to a given chaotic system. The 
method also downhill simplex the controllers and reduce their cost. 
In Chapter 17, the chaos in integral and fractional order double Ikeda systems with total 
order of derivatives from 2 to 0.2 are studied by phase portraits, Poincaré maps and bifurcation 
diagrams. It is found that chaos exists in all cases. 
In Chapter 18, the chaotic behaviors of double Ikeda systems are obtained by replacing their 
delay time by a function of chaotic state variables of a second chaotic system. It is found that 
  148
synchronizations are found. The trajectory will be reversed if the initial condition of 1x  or 1y  is 
negative. In these cases, the lag or anticipated anti-synchronization exists. From the results of 
simulation, we find six temporary lag (anticipated) synchronization intervals in 30000seconds. 
Although the numerical simulations of temporary lag and anticipated synchronization and 
anti-synchronization are showed in this . However, the theoretical analysis and its applications 
should be open for further work in the future. 
In Chapter 24, the parameter excited method is applied to synchronize two uncoupled double 
Mackey-Glass systems. By replacing the corresponding parameters with a Rayleigh noise and 
choose the appropriate noise strength, the lag synchronization can be successfully obtained. 
Temporary lag synchronization, partial lag synchronization, chaos control and robustness of lag 
synchronization are also obtained. The abundance of various phenomena fully exhibits the 
potential application of this method.

Duffing系統，van der Pol系統與線性Mathieu系統原為振動學科之最重要最
典型的系統。自渾沌動力學興起後，Duffing系統，van der Pol系統由於其為非線
性系統故亦沿習成為渾沌動力學學科中最重要最典型的系統，四十年來對此二系
統的渾沌研究之文獻可謂汗牛充棟，至今方興未艾。而線性Mathieu系統，則由
於其為線性方程，不具渾沌性質，故在渾沌動力學學科中乃不再提及。人們忽視
了非線性Mathieu系統實為Duffing系統中參數由常數轉為時間週期函數之推廣，
實亦應成為渾沌動力學科之最重要最典型之系統。本計畫主持人率先研究非線性
Mathieu系統之渾沌行為[6]，可謂遲來之補求。眾所週知，此三種典型系統除理
論意義外，廣泛應用於機械、電機、物理、化學、生科、奈米系統，本計畫今研
究雙Duffing系統，雙van der Pol系統及雙種類型的非線性Mathieu系統，不僅對
渾沌動力學學科中最重要最典型的三種渾沌系統的研究的拓廣與深化，更重要的
是它們本身顯然具有更複雜的，未經發現的複雜渾沌行為，本研究對渾沌動力學
學科具重大意義。其應用於機械、電機、物理、化學、生科、奈米之耦合系統，
具有重要的實用價值。 
渾沌同步除本身之重要理論價值外，其研究在秘密通訊、神經網路、自我組
織等方面有日益廣泛之應用。廣義渾沌同步則為渾沌同步之進一步發展，其應用
亦方興未艾。本計畫提出三種新的渾沌同步。實用適應廣義同步法糾正了目前國
際文獻中未經証明即認為估值參數趨於為之參數之錯誤，首次在渾沌同步中引入
概率概念，具重大理論及實用意義。由於V& 之要求降低，實際應用亦較易實現。
純誤差穩定的廣義同步，則彌補了國際文獻中需用數值計算結果為條件之理論，
即有缺陷之理論。在理論與實用上有重要意義。不同起始條件的延遲同步等多種
渾沌同步則為新發現的渾沌運動之現象，特別是Ikeda系統的永遠性延遲同步或
反同步，不同於傳統理論，尤具重大意義。
