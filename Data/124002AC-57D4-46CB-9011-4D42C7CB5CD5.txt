1. Introduction 
Recently calcium HA has become the favourite bioceramic as a bioactive 
reinforcement in composites for medical implants. Artificially synthesized HA proved 
to be a successful substitute for natural HA. Besides being biocompatible and nontoxic, 
this material exhibits unique osteoinductive properties [1]. Up to now, the porous HA, 
however, did not have mechanical properties necessary for this type of application [2]. 
One of the solutions of the problem is the development of the following biocomposites: 
ceramics/ceramics, ceramics/metal, ceramics/polymer [3-5] widely used in medicine 
and stomatology for repair of bone tissue. Bone itself is an organic–inorganic 
composite and it is logical that the search for a new generation of implant materials be 
supposed to focus on hybrid materials that combine the strength and stiffness of an 
inorganic compound with the flexibility, toughness and resorbability of an organic 
phase. 
Ceramic/polymer composites have advantage over pure ceramics or polymers [6]. 
Special attention has been focused on biodegradable polymers which have been 
successfully applied so far in surgery and medicine in general [7, 8]. Biodegradable 
polymers having a high starting strength, which lasts for some desired time, are 
biocompatible with bone tissue and produce nontoxic products during degradation [9]. 
Recently, ceramic/polymer composites with polylactide (PLLA) as the polymer phase 
have attracted great attention due to favorable characteristics of PLLA [2, 9]. 
Poly-L-lactides possesses mechanical properties and has the ability to degrade in the 
human body environment and can be absorbed by the human body. [10]. Therefore, it 
is a good candidate for the matrix of bioactive and biodegradable composite implants 
that will guide tissue growth and be replaced by newly formed tissue. Being similar in 
composition to the main inorganic component of natural bone and possessing bioactive 
and osteoconductive properties, HA has become the significant bioceramic as a 
bioactive reinforcement in composites for medical implants. However, HA is difficult 
to shape because of its brittleness and lack of flexibility [11]. Therefore incorporation 
of the HA in polymer composites to overcome the processing and dispersion 
challenges is of great interest to biomedical community. 
Feedstock suitable for Powder Injection Molding (PIM) should be as concentrated 
as possible (more powder, less binder) to reduce slumping and shrinkage during 
debinding and sintering, respectively. On the other hand, insufficient binder will cause 
voids to form which leads to molding difficulties. Excessive binder will lower the 
feedstock viscosity, and is not desirable because it will result in powder–binder 
separation during molding, leading to flashing or inhomogeneities in the molded part.  
Generally, a feedstock should contain the maximum powder loading to minimize 
shrinkage during sintering, and at the same time, without sacrificing its ease of 
When the temperature of the product reaches around 90℃, water circulation was 
turned on for cooling the mixing sink. The speed was gradually reduced below 35 rpm. 
HA and PLA was then kneaded to a uniform feedstock. The feedstock was ground to a 
size of 2 mm in a grinding machine to form pellets which are suitable for injection 
molding. The kneading process is shown in Fig 2. In practical, using kneading is not 
easy task to incorporate 40wt% of HA to PLA polymer.  
 
2.2.2 Injection molding 
The mold with tensile and impact cavities was used to fabricate the mechanical 
specimens, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The sketch dimension for mechanical specimens with 
runner and sprue was shown in Fig. 3(b). The specimens were then manufactured by 
injection molding machine (Arburg, German) with 25 Tone capacities. The injection 
molding involves a number of parameters such as melting temperature, injection 
pressure and cooling time for parameters of the bio-composite. To optimize the 
injection molding parameters, we attempted many molding trials. The injection 
molding defects were eliminated and the parameters were finally optimized. The main 
operating parameters used included working temperature of 185℃-195 ℃, injection 
pressure of 780 bars, injection speed of 30 ccm/s, and cooling time of 15 sec. 
To examine the accuracy of a polymer with added reinforcing fillers. The 
mechanical specimens were measured with a coordinate measurement machine (CMM; 
Poly, Italy). The precision level of the measurements was 1 micron. Tensile and impact 
tests were out Test specimen for Tensile (ASTM D 638) and Impact (ASTM D 256) 
strengths Tensile strength was measured by using a universal testing machine 
(Cometech Co. Ltd, Taichung Hsien, Taiwan). Same machine was used to measure the 
impact strength (model no. QC – 639 N). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Particle size Analyzer 
Figure 4 shows the particle sizes of the as-received hydroxyapatite powders were 
around 1.2 micrometer reported by Dynamic Laser Scattering Particle Size Analyzer 
(DLS-PSA, HORIBA LB-550, ?) [16]. According to DLS, the form of distribution was 
standard. Fromthegraph of volumeversus particle size, there is hump which 
resembles theparticle sizedistributions. Higher peak in the graph shows natural HA 
particlesizedistribution. In this analysis the existing of particle size distribution could 
be causedbyscattereddistributionduringmixing process. 
Particle size of the raw materials is an important factor that can 
influencemicrostructure andmechanical properties of later processed sample.

 3.3 Mechanical properties   
3.3.1 Tensile strength and Young’s modulus 
Test specimen for Tensile (ASTM D 638) and Impact (ASTM D 256) strengths 
was injected as shown in fig 7 which included tensile, impact, and runners [20]. Tensile 
strength was measured by using a universal testing machine (Cometech Co. Ltd, 
Taichung Hsien, Taiwan). Same machine was used to measure the impact strength 
(model no. QC – 639 N). 
Figure7 (a) shows the injection molding dye used for fabricating the impact and 
tensile test piece through injection molding technique. Figure 7 (b) shows the 
dimension and length of the specimen. We have used a runner for the first time with a 
sprue which links the tension and impact. Figure 7 (c) show the best tension and 
impact specimen for HA 20% fabricated through injection molding.   
From Fig 8 (a, b, c) we can see the tension and impact test pieces were fabricated 
and separately shown which contains HA 40%, 20 % and 10 %.  From the above 
fabricated specimens, 40 % of HA is also formed well due to the applied high pressure 
in the injection molding. The surface of the test specimen is smooth and uniformity is 
achieved. This may be due to the formation of even distribution of particles in the high 
pressure. 
Figure 11 shows the tensile strength on the HA-PLA contents. It can be seen that 
for the as-molded HA-PLA composite, there is a significant increase in tensile strength 
at low HA contents of up to 20%. Beyond this for 40%, tensile strength began to 
decrease almost in a linear approach.  
This may be due to the higher concentration of HA incorporated in to PLA and the 
composite instantly looses its tensile strength. A typical SEM micrograph taken on the 
tensile fracture surface of the composite is shown in Fig 8 
Young's modulus is one of the important properties to be considered in designing 
structural component [21]. Figure 12 shows that the Young's modulus increases with 
the increase in reinforcement content. When the Young's modulus is improved, it is 
possible to decrease the component thickness and therefore reduce the weight. Stiffness 
and elastic bucking properties of the composite materials depends upon the modulus 
with given thickness. 
 Figure 10 show the scanning electron microscopy for the tensile test piece. It can 
be seen that the prepared tensile test piece surface is smooth and contains microspores 
and voids. The brittleness of the reinforcing HAP particles and their tendency to fracture 
under localized deformation results in particle pores and debinding of the particles 
interface leading to final fracture of the mold is the evidence from the SEM image [18]. 
Microspores can be observed in the regions of particle agglomeration are primarily the 
distribution of HA particles in PLA composite leads to good mechanical and biological 
properties of the composite for bone tissue repair. To attain the homogeneous 
distribution the fabrication parameters of the biocomposites were optimized and 
mechanical studies and surface morphology of specimen were carried out. Hence we 
conclude from the obtained result, 20% of HA incorporated into PLA is most excellent 
and optimized condition which is practically applicable for medical implants.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Biomaterials are man-made origin that are used to direct, supplement or replace 
the functions of living tissues of human body. Bioabsorbable implants are widely in 
use in orthopedic surgery. One popular application is in the use of interference screws 
for knee ligament reconstructive surgery. Various advantages of bioabsorbable implants 
over traditional metallic implants have been proposed [1, 2]. Increasingly absorbable 
materials have been replacing metals as the materials of choice for implants used in 
certain orthopedic surgical procedures. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid), 
poly (-caprolactone), and their copolymers have attracted wide attention for their 
biodegradability in the human body. However, the mechanical strength, toughness, and 
elastic modulus of these polymers were lower than those of natural cortical bones [3]. 
Bone plates and screws made of a biodegradable material are considered to be a 
good alternative for metallic ones. The main advantage of biodegradable plates and 
screws is that they lose their mechanical properties due to degradation so that loads are 
gradually retransferred to the bone, preventing stress-shielding of the healed bone. 
Moreover, if the material fully degrades, a re-operation for the removal of the plate and 
screw can be avoided [4-6]. Because of these advantage, biodegradable polyesters such 
as poly (L-lactide) or polyglycolide have been studied extensively during the last two 
decades. These biodegradable polyesters have been used as internal fixation devices in 
the shape of rods, screws and bone plates [7]. 
Currently, the majority of absorbable implant devices are made of poly-L-lactide 
(PLLA) due to its good mechanical properties, excellent long-term strength retention, 
and inherent biocompatibility. Poly(a-hydroxy acids), and speciﬁcally polylactic acid 
(PLA), are amongst the most well known bioabsorbable materials and have been used 
in numerous applications such as sutures, pins, screws and drug delivery systems [8,9]. 
Both in viva and in vitro studies have shown that PLLA can be considered to be a 
biocompatible and biodegradable materia1 [10-13]. However, PLA may not 
completely meet the requirements for some applications due to its insuﬃcient 
mechanical properties or its degradation characteristics. 
For slower-degrading, implants the most interesting material seems to be 
polylactic acid (PLA). Its degradation is influenced by the molecular weight, the 
proportion of its copolymer, and the manufacturing technique [14-17] and can vary 
from a few weeks up to several years. PLA degradation is a complex process that has 
been extensively investigated [18, 19]. Indeed, it is known that there are numerous 
variables, such as the materials chemical structure, crystallinity, molecular weight, 
processing conditions, shape and size, aﬀecting the polymer degradation mechanisms. 
The addition of an inorganic phase into the polymeric matrix increases the complexity 
of the degradation pattern of the material. Some studies have reported dramatic 
of 65 rpm and the heater was turned off. So the temperature of the mixture product will 
decrease gradually. When the temperature of the product reaches around 90℃, water 
circulation was turned ON for cooling the mixing sink. The speed was gradually 
reduced below 35 rpm. HAP and PLA was then kneaded to a uniform feedstock as 
shown in Figure1.  
In practical, using kneading is not easy task to incorporate 40wt% of HA to PLA 
or any other biopolymers. But we have successfully achieved with incorporating 
40wt% of HA in to PLA applicable to orthopedic implants such as bone screw. The 
feedstock was ground to a size of 1-3 mm in a grinding machine to form pellets which 
are suitable for injection molding to obtain bone screw. 
 
2.2.2 Injection Molding 
 
The specimens were fabricated on Arburg Injection molding machine with 25 
Tone capacities. The injection molding involves a number of parameters such as 
melting temperature, air pressure, air velocity, cooling time for parameters of the 
composite. To optimize the injection molding parameters, we attempted many molding 
trials.  
The injection molding defects were eliminated and the parameters were finally 
optimized. Maximum temperature during injection process [29] was 195℃. Mini 
dumb-bell shaped tensile and an impact specimen with geometrical dimension is 
shown in figure 2. The main operating parameters used include: working temperature 
185℃-195 ℃, injection pressure, 780 bar, injection speed 30 ccm/s and cooling time 
15 sec. 
elongated strands of PLA. 
 
4.2 Degradation of HA-PLA composites in vitro  
4.2.1 Tensile test piece 
HA-PLA test piece and bone screw were prepared by injection molding. The 
tensile test piece were placed in solution for a month and surface morphology was 
carried out after every week in order to know the degradation property of tensile test 
piece of 10%, 20% and 40% shown in fig 5,6 and 7 respectively. Field scanning 
electron microscope (FSEM) images were taken using a JSM-Joel. From the images it 
is clear that, spherical particles was observed and no degradation takes place when 
10% of HA is incorporated into PLA.  
This may be due to the property of composites which is not binded well together. 
When increasing the HA to 20% we can see the changes in SEM image found in fig 6.  
 Degradation takes place after 2 weeks and spherical particles and fibre like formation 
was observed at the end of 4 weeks. Further increasing HA to 40 % we could able to 
see that there is no degradation after 2 weeks and the surface morphology remains 
same. In fig 7 it was found that there is a separation of particles in the surface. This 
may be due to non-bonding and excess of HA percentage incorporated in to the 
polymer.  
 
4.2.2 Surface Morphology of Bone screw 
Degradation property of bone screw with three pin bending point is discussed 
with the help of Scanning electron microscopy show in fig 8, 9 & 10. In each case the 
incorporation of HA percentage into PLA varies from 10%, 20%, 40%. 
SEM analysis showed remarkable changes in the morphology of the composite 
surface during the degradation period as shown in Fig. 8. At the initial time, we could 
to observe the pores in surface with spherical particles. However, after 4 weeks of 
immersion in saline solution the SEM image show no change in degradation of 10% of 
HA. When we increase the percentage of HA to PLA in the bone screw, after a week 
there is change in surface morphology show in fig. 9.  
In fig 9 (a) it shows a smooth surface and after 2 weeks degradation takes place. 
We could able to observe the microspores along with the composite at the surface after 
4 weeks. But for HA 40 % there is a drastic change in the surface morphology and at 
the end of 4 weeks it is observed that there is a shift in formation of surface 
morphology. Particles in the surface seemed to be separated. This may be due to the 
non-bonding property of HA with PLA. From the SEM image we conclude that 
degradation of bone screw in 20 % of HA added to PLA shows more degradation than 
the other two compositions.
