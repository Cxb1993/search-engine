Abstract 
 
Several important flow problems often involve 
continuum and rarefied regions in the flow fields. 
Numerical simulations of these flows can not be done 
properly alone using either continuum or particle 
method. Hybrid of continuum and particle methods is 
often required to properly resolve the flow fields. In 
this 3-year project, we have proposed an improved 
parallelized hybrid DSMC-NS scheme. In the first 
year, we have converted the 3-D PDSC (Parallelized 
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Code) into a general-
purpose DSMC which features 2-D, 2-D 
axisymmetric and 3-D functionalities. In the second 
year, we have applied the NS equation solver to solve 
for chemical reacting flow field near the typical 
ramjet and scramjet. In addition, we have also 
developed and validated a new mesh refinement, 
named virtual mesh refinement, for unstructured 
grids. In the final year, the proposed improved hybrid 
DSMC-NS scheme is validated and applied to some 
realistic flow fields. 
 
Keywords: parallelized DSMC, hybrid DSMC-NS 
code, virtual mesh refinement. 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
Several technically important flow problems often 
involve continuum and rarefied regions in the flow 
fields. Examples include expanding reaction control 
system plumes from a space vehicle2,3), hypersonic 
flows past a blunt body4), expanding plumes from a 
rocket at high altitude5), high compression ratio 
turbomolecular pump6) and jet-type chemical vapor 
deposition7), to name a few. Unfortunately, neither 
continuum nor rarefied flow solver can be used alone 
to accurately and efficiently solve the entire flow field. 
Thus, how to efficiently and accurately simulate this 
kind of flows represents a great challenge to the 
computational fluid dynamics community at large. 
Prior studies in solving flow fields involving 
continuum and rarified regions employed the hybrid 
DSMC-NS schemes with various approaches of 
coupling the particle and continuum methods. 
Detailed reviews of these approaches can be found in 
Schwartzentruber and Boyd8-9) and Wu, et al.1) and 
references cited therein. In general, a hybrid DSMC-
NS method applies the concept of spatial domain 
decomposition to distinguish the computational 
domain of rarefaction or thermal non-equilibrium to 
 4
the scramjet combustion chamber. 
In the present numerical investigation, 
hydrogen/air combustion conditions are of interest. A 
reduced 9-step hydrogen/oxygen reaction chemical 
kinetics mechanism 12)-13) is employed for the 
combustion simulation. This chemistry model is 
summarized in Table 1. 
 
2.2 DSMC method 
The direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) 
method is a computational tool for simulating flows 
in which effects at the molecular scale become 
significant [1]. The Boltzmann equation, which is 
appropriate for modelling these rarefied flows, is 
extremely difficult to solve numerically due to its 
high dimensionality and the complexity of the 
collision term. DSMC provides a particle based 
alternative for obtaining realistic numerical solutions. 
In this report, a new mesh-refining process 
(virtual mesh refinement) for DSMC using 
unstructured grids, which is based on the TAS 
(transient adaptive sub-cell) concept, is introduced to 
virtually refine the background cells. Virtual mesh 
refinement (VMR) based on the data obtained on the 
initial DSMC simulation using the background grid. 
The results of the initial DSMC simulation are used 
to determine the local mean free path in each 
background cell, which is then compared with the 
corresponding cell size. The result of comparison is 
then used to calculate the number of refined cells in 
each coordinate direction required to resolve the local 
mean free path in background cell. Note the refined 
cell is organized as Cartesian structured grids with 
the same cell size. Refined cell size is normally taken 
to be less than one half of the local mean free path, 
although it can be controlled by the user. A typical 
example is schematically shown in Fig. 1. One 
important advantage is the particle tracing becomes 
very efficient which results directly from the use of 
Cartesian structured grids for the refined cells. The 
sub-cell in each background cell, which contains the 
background cell centroid is also identified in this step. 
This will be used in the final data output.  
In addition, area of each sub-cell (“area” in two-
dimensional case; “volume” in three-dimensional 
case), which is geometrically inside the background 
cell, is calculated using the Monte Carlo (MC) 
method. Note the area of the sub-cell (or volume) is 
required in calculating the number of collision pairs 
such as NTC method21). The reason not to apply the 
conventional method such as coordinate geometry is 
that it becomes very cumbersome and complicated as 
it is extended to three-dimensional case. The MC 
method is easy in concept as well as practical 
implementation, as shown schematically in Fig. 2. 
Each particle with randomly assigned position is 
checked if it is located in the background cell. Once it 
is located in the background cell, then the sub-cell 
which contains the particle is easily determined by 
taking advantage of the Cartesian structured sub-cells. 
Only those particles located inside the sub-cell and 
background cell are counted for the area calculation. 
The area of the ith sub-cell inside the background cell 
is thus calculated as follows: 
Vvci Vc  Ri / Ri
i1
Nvc  
where Ri is the number of particles located inside the 
ith sub-cell, Vc is the area of background cell and Nvc 
is the total number of sub-cells. Our experience 
shows that approximately 5,000*Nvc particles are 
required to reach 0.1% error for area calculations of 
all the sub-cells, which takes about 12.5 minutes of 
computational time for ~300,000 virtual sub-cells 
using 12 processors. This computational overhead is 
comparatively low as compared to the total DSMC 
simulation in general. 
 
2.3 Hybrid DSMC-NS method 
2.3.1 Kinetic Velocity Sampling 
To probe whether the boundary layer is a thermal 
non-equilibrium region, a direct kinetic sampling 
study for a supersonic wedge flow case is conducted, 
as schematically shown in Fig. 3. This test problem 
may represent an idealistic flow for studying the 
continuum and thermal breakdown parameter since it 
includes a leading edge near the tip of the wedge 
surface, an oblique shock wave originating from the 
leading edge, a boundary layer along the wedge 
surface, an expanding fan starting at the end of wedge 
surface and a highly rarefied wake behind the wedge. 
Sampling locations and distribution of continuum 
breakdown parameter Knmax based on flow density, 
temperatures and velocities, resulting from a pure 
DSMC simulation, are indicated in Fig. 3.  
Important flow conditions are briefly summarized 
as: nitrogen gas, Mach number of 4 (1,111m/s), free-
stream temperature of 185.6K and wedge wall-
temperature of 293.3K. DSMC related simulation 
conditions are the same as those described earlier1). 
Note the Knudsen number based on the length of the 
wedge and the free-stream conditions is 0.0017. In 
addition, the thermal non-equilibrium indicator is 
further generalized in the present study as follows:

where Tx, Ty and Tz are translational temperature in the 
x-, y-, z-direction, respectively. Trot, T and Ttot are 
rotational, vibrational and average temperature, 
respectively. rot and  are the number of degree of 
freedom of rotation and vibration, respectively. 
Totally 52 points, including near leading edge, 
oblique shock, boundary layer and expanding fan, are 
selected in the computational domain. Velocity 
distributions of three Cartesian directions at each 
selected point are sampled for particles up to at least 
0.3 million and then are compared with the 
corresponding local Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity 
distributions to calculate the degree of continuum 
 6
DSMC solver (PDSC) [21-23]. 
As mentioned earlier, by applying the Knmax as 
the breakdown parameter in addition to the thermal 
non-equilibrium indicator PTne, the boundary layer 
region is generally included as the breakdown DSMC 
domain for high-speed flows, which generally slows 
down the convergence of the coupling between two 
numerical solvers. In the present study we define a 
new continuum breakdown parameter Knp to replace 
the role of Knmax as follows, 
pKn pp
   
For example, Fig. 6 shows the initial breakdown 
domains using the new breakdown parameter 
(Knp>0.05) based on the solution of initial NS 
simulation. With this new breakdown parameter, most 
of the boundary layer can be excluded as one of the 
breakdown regions, in which the more efficient NS 
equation solver can solve the flow field with proper 
slip boundary conditions at wall. However, this may 
induce another slow convergence of coupling, 
although not necessary. The reason is that, based on 
the initial whole-domain NS simulation, we are not 
able to detect the thermal non-equilibrium near the 
leading edge since the UNIC-UNS is a single-
temperature NS equation solver like most of the 
others. This results in a very small breakdown region, 
based on the Knp, along the boundary layer near the 
leading edge. In the present study, we remove this by 
extending the breakdown interface 25 overlapping 
layers toward continuum side along the boundary 
layer. 
In brief summary, general procedures of newly 
proposed hybrid algorithm are summarized as follows: 
1) Simulate the whole domain using the NS solver; 2) 
Calculate breakdown parameters, Knp and TneP  based 
one-shot NS simulation or the hybrid solution from 
NS equation and DSMC solvers; 3) Determine the 
breakdown regions based on these two breakdown 
parameters in the whole flow field; 4) Estimate the 
location of thermal breakdown interface in regions 
near boundary layer by extending more layers; 5) 
Extend the breakdown domain with few overlapping 
layers towards continuum domain; 6) Simulate the 
breakdown domain using the DSMC solver; 7) Repeat 
Step 1) (but only for the continuum domain) through 
Step 6) until convergence is reached. 
 
 
3.  Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 N-S equation solver 
3.1.1 Ramjet Inlet Flow 
The experimental study of an axisymmetric 
ramjet inlet flow was performed by Nagarathinam 
[25]. The half angle of the inlet spike is 20 degrees. 
The experimental test conditions are Mach 2.18 frees-
tream, 296,000 Pa total pressure and 300 K total 
temperature. The strut that holds the center body to 
the cowl casing is omitted in the numerical 
computation. 
To represent this model numerically, a mesh with 
29,820 elements is generated (grid unit: 5 cm), which 
gives good grid resolution of the flow inside the inlet. 
The backpressure effect is provided using a porosity 
model, which represents the blockage effects in the 
flowfield downstream of the center body. A 
converged solution is obtained in 60,000 time steps 
with a 1.0E-06 sec time step size, which takes 60.6 
minutes CPU time using 8 processors with 99 percent 
parallel efficiency. This solution takes longer to run 
due to the need to adjust the blockage porosity to 
match the backpressure of the experiment. 
The predicted pressure field in the ramjet inlet is 
shown in Fig. 7, which indicates pressure recovery 
due to applied flow blockage effect downstream of 
the inlet that matches the test conditions. Fig. 8 
illustrates the predicted Mach number distributions of 
the ramjet inlet. For supersonic flow computations, 
numerical accuracy is critical in order to keep 
numerical diffusion low so as not to affect the 
resolution of flow and shock structures. 
 
3.1.2  Scramjet Inlet Flow 
The experimental investigation of this test case 
was conducted by Yanta et al. [26]. The inlet 
geometry consists of a forebody wedge angle of 10 
degrees and a 13-degree inward turning duct (inner 
wall turning radius of 0.057 m). The test conditions 
of this experiment are Mach 4 free-stream, 101,350 
Pa static pressure and 311 K static temperature. 
A mesh with 36,580 cells is generated for 
numerical computation (grid unit: 10 cm), which 
gives good grid resolution of the flow inside the inlet. 
A converged solution is obtained in 10,000 time step 
with a 3.0E-06 sec time step size, which takes 15.2 
minutes CPU time using 8 processors with 99.2 
percent parallel efficiency. 
The predicted scramjet inlet pressure field is 
shown in Fig. 9, which gives clear resolution of the 
shock train system in the inlet duct. Again, for 
supersonic flow calculations, numerical accuracy is 
critical such that minimum numerical diffusion can 
be kept for good flow structure resolution. As a part 
of the present numerical tests, a first-order upwind 
scheme was tried, which ends up with a false bow 
shock upstream of the cowl lip and destroy the shock 
structure in the inlet duct. Fig. 10 shows the predicted 
temperature contours. A high temperature region is 
predicted along the bottom wall just downstream of 
the inlet turn. This is caused by cowl lip shock 
interaction with the bottom wall boundary layer that 
separates and forms a steady recirculation region 
where high temperature recovery occurs. This flow 
separation feature is also revealed in Figs. 11 and 12 
of Mach number contour plots. Similar flow 
phenomenon is also observed in the experiment. For 
scramjet inlet designs, the cowl lip shock strength 
should be controlled by geometry tailoring such that 
this flow separation phenomenon can be avoided.

Related simulation conditions are also summarized in 
Table 4 for reference.  
 
3.4.2 Distribution of Breakdown Domains 
Fig. 20 shows the final breakdown regions after 
20 coupling iterations based on the simulation 
condition. Lines A-E are selected to compare the 
results among pure DSMC, pure NS equation solver 
(NSS), 3 and 20 hybrid DSMC-NS iterations. Note 
the breakdown domain only includes the regions 
across the shock, and zones near the leading edge and 
wake region. We can see most boundary layer regions 
are excluded, which the NS equation solver can be 
used to obtain the flow field more efficiently. Fig. 21 
illustrates the profiles of continuum breakdown 
parameter Knp along Line B. The horizontal dashed 
line showing the threshold value KnP at which the 
continuum breaks down and the NS equation solver 
cannot be used. 
General trend of the KnP distribution shows that 
the value is rather large (up to 0.4 or larger) near the 
shoulder of square cylinder due to large property 
gradients in leading edge region, and decreases to 
rather small value in the region between the boundary 
layer and the oblique shock, and finally becomes large 
again across the oblique shock (up to 0.5 or less). 
Obviously, the KnP distribution from either 3 or 20 
coupled DSMC-NS iteration is in good agreement 
with those by pure DSMC simulation while pure NS 
equation solver predicts a much thinner shock length 
and different location of oblique shock. 
Fig. 21a and Fig. 21b show contour distributions 
of density and translational temperature from the pure 
DSMC simulation and the coupled DSMC-NS 
algorithm, respectively. Results of the present coupled 
algorithm are in good agreement with those of pure 
DSMC simulation. Fig. 23 illustrates detail 
comparisons of density, translational temperature and 
profiles along Line B while the other lines are not 
presented in the present paper due to the limitation of 
paper length. Based on the calculated breakdown 
parameters (KnP and TneP ), the flow region is divided 
into four sub-domains, as shown in Fig. 23a: Zone I 
and Zone III are the DSMC solution domains, while 
the other two regions (II and VI) are the NS solution 
domains. At this location (along Line B), the results of 
the NS equation solver deviate appreciably from those 
of both pure DSMC simulation and the coupled 
method (after either 3 or 20 iterations). Results of the 
present hybrid methods are still in excellent 
agreement with those of pure DSMC simulation for 
the entire domain. It also shows 3 hybrid iterations are 
good enough to reach convergence of the hybrid 
algorithm. Related computational timings are listed in 
Table 5 for reference. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this 3-year NSC project, we have: 1) applied 
the NS equation solver to simulate reacting flow field 
near the ramjet and scramjets; 2) developed and 
validated a VMR algorithm in PDSC and 3) 
developed and demonstrated an improved DSMC-NS 
scheme. The first one shows that the present NS 
equation solver can predict important features of these 
challenging supersonic to hypersonic flows. The 
second show that the newly proposed VMR can 
faithfully reproduce the benchmark solution with a 
much reduced computational cost. An improved 
parallel hybrid DSMC-NS algorithm is proposed and 
verified in the project. Direct kinetic velocity 
sampling is conducted to point out that previously 
defined continuum breakdown parameter Knmax could 
overestimate the degree of the continuum breakdown 
in most region of the boundary layer, where the 
thermal equilibrium generally holds well. A new 
breakdown KnP based on pressure is designed to 
effectively “exclude” such that boundary layer region. 
A 2-D 25-degree wedge flow (M∞=4) was used as the 
test case for verification of the improved hybrid 
method. Most of the boundary layer region can be 
excluded as the breakdown region, if the breakdown 
parameter Knp is employed. With this new hybrid 
algorithm, simulation converges faster as compared to 
the old one. Then, this improved algorithm is applied 
to a hypersonic flow (M∞=12) pass a square cylinder 
case. Results show that, with the proposed coupled 
algorithm, simulation can obtain a good solution 
within 3 coupling iterations.
