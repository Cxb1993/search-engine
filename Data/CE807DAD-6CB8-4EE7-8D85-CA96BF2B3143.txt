Introduction 
Glucose is an attractive target, because it 
is not only an important biomarker for 
diabetes but also a kind of fuel for a biofuel 
cell. In other words, a glucose biosensor can 
work both for monitoring the glucose level 
and for the anode of the biofuel cell. An 
amperometric enzyme-based biosensor is the 
best choice for biochemical analysis due to 
their good selectivity, sensitivity, rapid 
response, miniature size, and reproducible 
results [1].  
Among various detection methods, the 
amperometric enzyme-based biosensor 
probably is the best choice for biochemical 
analysis due to its good selectivity, high 
sensitivity, rapid response, convenient 
measurement, miniature size, and reproducible 
results. In order to reuse the expensive 
recognized biomolecules, the enzyme has to 
be immobilized on the electrode.  
In the past decade, the technique of 
Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) 
has become more and more popular for 
fabricating sensor chips. There are many 
choices for the materials of the microchannel, 
such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) [2], 
poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) and 
polycarbonate (PC) … etc. Among this, 
PDMS offers many advantages, including 
outstanding elasticity, pervious to light, good 
bio-compatible, good mechanical stability and 
convenient to be fabricated, and it can be used 
not only for the channel stamp but also for the 
gas-pump  and gas-valve.   
    In this research, two systems were 
reviewed to cover a good 
interference-independent glucose biosensor. 
One (system A) was designed that a 
three-electrode pattern was fabricated on the 
glass substrate by combining the technique of 
MEMS and covering a microchannel by the 
PDMS to form a sensing chip, thus the biochip 
worked in a flow system with the advantages 
of miniature, reuse, less injecting sample and 
continuous operation. Based on the 
electrochemical method, the recognized 
biomolecules, glucose oxidase, was 
immobilized by the conducting polymer, 
PEDOT, on the working electrode of the 
biochip for determining the glucose 
concentration. The enzyme-immobilized 
working electrode directly senses the 
catalyzed product, H2O2 according to Eq. 
(1)-(3) [3]. Besides, a second working 
electrode of bare platinum, which is located in 
the near front of the first enzyme-immobilized 
working electrode, is designed for eliminating 
the oxidation-favored interferences near the 
surface of electrode before the fluid in 
microchannel reaching the 
enzyme-immobilized working electrode by 
applying the same potential. The schematic of 
the whole microfluidic sensing system, both 
the lateral and vertical views, is illustrated in 
Fig. 1.

gluconic acid + FADH2-GOD (1)

H2O2→ 2H+ + O2 + 2e-                         (3) 
 
The other (system B) is that the all-in-one 
electrodes, which co-immobilize with the 
enzymes and the mediators based on layer by 
layer structure shown in Fig. 2. The first layer, 
the carbon paste which was coated on the 
flexible substrate of stainless steel (ssteel), 
was acted as an adsorbent layer for the 
mediator, p-benzoquinone (BZQ), by the 
hydrophobic force. The BZQ and GOD were 
drop-coated on the electrode in order and the 
entrapped matrix, PEDOT, was 
electropolymerized on the outer layer to 
prevent the leakage of mediators and enzymes. 
The all-in-one electrode has the advantages of 
flexible, workable in oxygen-independent 
solution, convenient, reusable, lower sensing 
potential and lower interference effect.

electropolymerized on the outer layer of the 
prepared ssteel/C/BZQ-GOD electrode to 
prevent the leakage of GOD, in a pH 7 
phosphate buffer solution containing 10 mM 
EDOT monomer and 0.1 mM non-ionic 
surfactant, PEG, by applying a constant 
potential of 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl/sat’d KCl for 
50 s. Afterward, the 
ssteel/C/BZQ-GOD/PEDOT electrode was 
stored in a pH 7 PBS at 4 oC when not in use. 
Results and discussions system A 
The sensing chip 
In each 4-in glass wafer, two pieces of 
sensing chips (70 mm × 35 mm) were cut by a 
diamond cutter. The microelectrode arrays can 
be divided into four sections (mentioned in 
section 3.2) and the surface metal layer of the 
working, reference and counter electrodes are 
platinum, silver and platinum, respectively. 
The SEM pictures (not shown) indicated that 
the dimension of the interdigitated array was 
the same as that of the designed pattern. 
Finally, by covering the PDMS with a 
microfluidic channel of 100 μm height, the 
sensing chip was fabricated. Moreover, for 
getting a better stability of long-term 
operation, the surface of reference electrode 
was modified as Ag/AgCl by chemical 
deposition. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of 
the Ag/AgCl is about 95 mV vs. SCE 
(commercial model) in the electrolyte of 0.3 
M KCl and the variation between the two 
electrodes is less than 5 mV for a period of 
2,500 s. It was approximately corresponding 
to the theoretical value of 102.9 mV based on 
the electrochemical theory. 
When the potential of the first working 
electrode (WE1) was cycled between a 
potential range of 0.2 ~ 1.2 V at a scan rate of 
0.1 V/s, the current for the first cycle 
increased at around 0.7 V due to the oxidation 
of the EDOT monomer. On electrooxidation, a 
radical cation of EDOT is produced which is 
transformed to a polymeric species via several 
follow-up reactions. However, the anodic 
current at higher potential (0.9-1.2 V) 
decreased with the cycle number, because the 
high potential may result in the partial 
degradation or overoxidation of PEDOT film. 
In the 15th to 20th cycles, the CVs of 
polymerization were almost the same and this 
implies that the polymer film was not growing 
due to the resistance of polymer film. During 
the polymerization process, the PEDOT 
possesses positive charges, so the negatively 
charged glucose oxidase (pI=4.2) would 
migrate to the PEDOT surface at pH=7.4 
(PBS) and be grabbed by the growing polymer 
chains. Besides, it is also an advantage of CV 
method that the enzyme has more time to 
diffuse to the polymer surface when the 
applied potential was swept to the cathodic 
direction in which the EDOT can’t be 
polymerized. The immobilized enzyme was 
quantified as about 0.101 U/cm2 by UV 
spectrophotometer after series chemical 
reactions in previous work [4]. 
The sensing performance 
In Fig. 4, the flow injection data were 
obtained by applying 0.7 V at a flow rate of 10 
ml/hr and each current pulse was resulted 
from different concentrations with an injecting 
volume of 30 μl. Besides, both the peak 
current and the charge capacity of each pulse 
can be collected as the sensing signal. 
However, the reproducibility in the peak 
currents was not good and hence the charge 
capacities were used for recording the sensing 
signal instead of current. The relationship 
obtained between the net charge capacities 
and the different glucose concentrations by 
applying a voltage of 0.7 V vs. Ag/AgCl on 
PEDOT modified enzyme electrode (WE1) 
with the same injecting volume of 30 μl at 
different flow rates is shown in Fig. 5. The 
linear regression falls from 1 to 10 mM, which 
includes the range of normal human blood, 
with a sensitivity of 157 μC cm-2 mM-1 (4.6 
μA cm-2 mM-1 in current plot, which is not 
shown). The sampling time, the time taken 
from each injection of the sample to the pulse 
current returning approximately to the 
background level, was within 180, 100, 70 and 
30 s at a flow rate of 5, 10, 20 and 50 ml/hr, 
respectively. Operating at a high flow rate had 
a faster response, but lost another important 
parameter, sensitivity. Hence the proper flow 
rate was selected as 10 ml/hr by considering 
the performance. The response time and the 
recovery time, defined as the time taken for 
the current reaching of 95% of the steady-state 
 6
poly(vinylferrocene-co-2-hydroxyethyl 
methacrylate), and polyamidoamine particle 
linked by GOD was co-immobilized with the 
gold nanoparticles modified by cobalt 
hexacyanoferrate (mediator) on conducting 
glass in the second work. In the last work, the 
GOD and ferrocene monocarboxylic 
acid-modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles were both 
entrapped on carbon paste electrode. In 
addition, only the linear range of the first 
literature (1.4-8.9 mM) covered the normal 
human range. 
For simulating the real sample, the most 
common interferences including AA, DA, UA 
and AP were applied in this system, and their 
formal potentials are about 0.2 V, 0.3 V, 0.5V 
and 0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl/sat’d KCl, respectively. 
Besides, the normal ranges of those four 
species in blood are 34-80 μM, <1 μM, 
178-416 μM and 130-150 μM, respectively. 
The current responses of the interferences 
were shown in Fig. 7 based on the sensing 
current of 6 mM glucose as 100%.  
Conclusions and future works 
In system A, the PEDOT-modified 
electrode was used as a matrix to entrap 
glucose oxidase and was integrated in a flow 
system of sensing chip successfully. The 
optimal injecting volume and flow rate were 
30 μl and 10 ml/hr, respectively. The 
performances of sensitivity, linear range, 
response time, recovery time and limit of 
detection were 157 μC cm-2 mM-1, 1-10 mM, 
15 s, 35-75 s and 0.15 mM at a flow rate of 10 
ml/hr, respectively. With an applied potential 
of 0.7 V on WE2, it can reduce the 
interference current of WE1. Since the 
interferences in the flow channel near the 
surface of the first electrode (WE2) had been 
pre-reacted electrochemically, and the 
interference-free sensor can be achieved at the 
second electrode (WE1). In the real sample 
test, the bias of bi-potential was +13.6 %, 
which is lower than that of single-potential. In 
system B, the proposed electrode fabricated by 
multilayer structures successfully works as a 
glucose biosensor in the oxygen-independence 
solution, and the anode of the biofuel cell by 
adding not only glucose solution but also the 
real blood of human beings. The electrode 
prepared by BZQ/DMF, shows a sensitivity of 
2.21 mA M-1 cm-2, a linear concentration 
range of 1.1~15 mM (including the human 
blood range) and a response time of 100 s at a 
sensing potential of 0.3 V. Besides, the current 
responses of the common interferences in 
blood were much lower than that of 6 mM 
glucose because of the low sensing potential 
and the patially negative charged polymer 
film.
