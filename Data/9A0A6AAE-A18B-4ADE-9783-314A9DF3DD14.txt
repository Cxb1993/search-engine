Abstract 
Magnetron sputter deposition is one of the mostly preferred processes to prepare high quality 
high-temperature superconductive YBa2Cu3O7-δ (YBCO) thin film in recent years.  However, it 
requires an elevated deposition temperature of 600°C or a post-annealing at 800°C for achieving 
superconductive crystalline microstructure.  Such high temperature treatments have limited the 
selection of device materials and the superconductivity performance of final device.  In this project, 
YBCO thin films were deposited by using thermionic enhanced (TE) magnetron sputtering.  The 
thermionic emission electron can activate and energize the species in the plasma for increasing the 
plasma density.  The increased plasma density in the space causes a higher ion flux toward the 
substrate with intensified ion bombardment, which improve surface migration of adatoms on the 
growing film surface, and consequently the increased crystallinity at low deposition temperature.  
Experimental results show that without TE, the YBCO films deposited at temperature between 
ambient to 400°C present non-feature and flatness amorphous structure.  When deposition 
temperature was raised to above 400°C, the YBCO film deposited without TE became crystal 
structure.  By further increasing the deposition temperature to 600°C, the YBCO film deposited 
without TE became a columnar crystal structure.  Unfortunately, the necessity of admitting oxygen 
for stoichiometric compensation has led tungsten filament material undergoing oxidation and 
melting when utilizing TE.  For this reason, the primary aim, to prepare YBCO film at low 
deposition temperature has to be achieved alternatively by using a platinum-coated tungsten 
filament with better oxidation resistance in the coming study.  However, optimization on the 
sputter deposition of YBCO film and thermionic enhanced sputter deposition technique has been 
demonstrated in this project.

本研究將在射頻磁控濺鍍系統中架設熱離化電子發射(Thermionic electron emission)系
統，藉由熱離化電子活化電漿中的物種來提高電漿密度[33]，透過此製程降低沉積溫度並獲得
品質優良高溫超導YBCO薄膜，這是因為電漿密度的提高，有助於離子轟擊的效果，使得濺
射出來的粒子擁有較高的能量飛向基材表面，在薄膜成長時獲得額外的能量，因而降低沉積
溫度，故使用熱離化電子輔助是最適合的一項手段。藉著此一觀念的延伸，如能使用一簡單

化輔助是在電子束蒸鍍製程中用以提高電漿密度的一種手段[34]，Fancy等人的基礎研究中證實
了電漿的離化率是可以被提昇的[35]，將之應用在濺鍍YBCO薄膜相信有助於降低結晶相生成
的溫度，其簡易的裝置架構也十分有利於產業化。 
此熱離化電子發射系統裝置十分簡易，透過抽取電子的電源供應器給予腔體正偏壓來吸
引電子，就可以使得熱電子(Thermoelectron)射出並撞擊空間中的氣體分子，來增加空間中的

圖10 未使用熱離化輔助之YBCO薄膜電阻率對溫度的關係 
本計畫中使用熱離化輔助系統藉此降低YBCO薄膜的沉積溫度，電漿氣氛為通入氬氣與
氧氣的混和氣體，而使用的燈絲材質為鎢，此鎢絲在氧氣氣氛下會急速氧化而斷裂，因此選
用不同的燈絲材來取代鎢絲。測試結果顯示，鉑絲在0 %的氧環境下，當加熱電源供應器所提
供的熱量高於其熔點(1772oC)時，在尚未施加偏壓抽取出熱電子之前而直接熔斷。鉬材也是
產生相同的情形導致熔斷，故不適用於本計畫。使用鉭絲的時候，發現加熱電流必須維持在
11 A以上，才有辦法抽取出足夠的熱電子以維持穩定的發射電流，然而空間中的氧氣會一直
攻擊鉭絲，使得鉭絲的表面形態一直改變，因此需要不斷的提高加熱燈絲電源供應器之輸出
功率以提供相同的發射電流，一但功率過高時會產生熱點(Hot-spot)現象，而無法繼續使用。 
上述使用各種耐高溫、抗氧化的燈絲材均無法體現熱離化輔助系統於YBCO薄膜的製
備。有鑑於此，為了解決燈絲破壞之問題，擬採用鉑被覆的鎢絲來作為燈絲材，使用此方式
的原因為鎢絲成本低且取得方便，同時具高熔點3410oC與4.5 eV的功函數，ㄧ直是最常使用
的燈絲材，在表面被覆上一層2 μm鉑的原因是選其本身耐氧化之特性，如此ㄧ來，兩種材料
相輔相成，即可改善上述缺點。唯美中不足之處，這項實驗結果無法在有效期限內呈現在本
計畫中。計畫主持人仍會秉持著研究的精神，持續地進行此實驗。雖然如此，同步與本計畫
進行研究的另一個電池正極材料系統：鈷酸鋰(Lithium cobalt oxide, LiCoO2)及磷酸鋰鐵
(Lithium iron phosphate, LiFePO4)薄膜透過本計畫所建置之熱離化技術使低溫高品質鍍膜生長
技術獲得成功。以LiCoO2薄膜為例，傳統濺鍍法製備LiCoO2薄膜電池正極，必需輔以800oC
後熱處理始可得出高電容量的結晶相，在熱離化輔助電漿濺鍍技術，將電漿密度提高，使得
高電容量結晶相得以在400oC的沉積溫度就可生成。 
六、結論 
本計畫使用熱離化輔助低溫沉積YBCO高溫超導薄膜，結果顯示，未使用熱離化輔助製
備YBCO薄膜沉積溫度低於400oC以下為非晶質薄膜，當沉積溫度提高到400oC以上時可獲得
結晶相YBCO薄膜。YBCO薄膜在室溫沉積為無明顯特徵的截面影像，當沉積溫度提高到600oC
時，可以觀察到柱狀晶的形成。使用熱離化輔助沉積YBCO薄膜發現，在混和氧氣的氣氛中，
會使得各種燈絲材氧化或是熔斷以致於無法體現低溫沉積YBCO的成果，而本研究室擬採用
鉑被覆的鎢絲來作為燈絲材，持續朝本計畫的研究主題前進。計畫完成之際發展完成的技術
包括「熱離化輔助低溫化沉積技術」、「最佳化YBCO薄膜製程參數」。

大會的議程總共有 4 天，此眾多場次的講演內容兼具專業與運用性，唯其平行多場之議
程中，選擇出席下列幾個感到興趣的場次，而其中部分也同時在壁報展出。由於本研究室從
事導電電極層、染料敏化及固態太陽能電池方面的研究，這次會議目光專注在太陽能電池
Photovoltaics，瞭解目前各研究單位發展的現況。其中印象深刻的有編號 O-PV-030，來至韓
國受邀演講者 Hyunjung Lee 利用聚合 PS 高分子微粒，將微粒塗佈至導電玻璃上，隨後把二
氧化鈦膠體填充入，使緊密附著於微粒表層，乾燥後，進行燒結，製備出具高比表面積的二
氧化鈦多孔層。此技術早在高分子領域中廣受研究，配製許多具多孔的陶瓷材料、發光材料

效率太陽電光電轉換效率約為 20-25%，大部分的太陽光損耗掉可能由於內部內電阻產生與太
陽光範圍無有效吸收所造成。由此衍生出兩大問題:製成封裝與元件疊層的設計。在元件疊層
的設計方面，如果導電電極能進行表面粗糙設計，使受光後產生多次的反射將有利於光電轉
換效率的提升，也能設計疊層由吸引長波鍍層往上堆疊吸收短波鍍層，光線從上而下照射使
各波長光能充分被吸收，這些使得本研究室之研究提供了另一角度的思考。其中也看到編號
O-PV-017，利用碳電極取代白金電極，雖然光電效率與原先使用白金電極一致，但碳材料優
勢在於成本遠低於白金，又具良好的穩定性。在這次會場所發表的論文明顯側重在改變電極
與被電極表面形態改變，提高光電轉換效率。

Titania (TiO2), known to have wide energy band gap, can greatly absorb dye if specific surface area can significantly be 
increased and hence the photovoltaic efficiency. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) based on mesoporous titania has been drawn 
much attention over the past few years. An attempt in this study is to employ micro-arc oxidation (MAO) process and alkali 
treatment to develop titania layer with very high specific surface area on pure titanium surface. Specimens were applied an anodic 
dc voltage at 400-500 V in a phosphate electrolytic solution during MAO process, followed by the alkali treatment in 1.25 M NaOH 
solution to produce nano-flaky anatase TiO2 on surface, with nano-flakes about 50 nm in dimension thus largely increase specific 
surface area. Result of photovoltaic efficiency measurement of the assembled DSSC device show that ultimate efficiency (0.23 %) 
can be obtained for the specimen post alkali-treated in 1.25 M NaOH solution, which exhibits the highest surface area and thus the 
enhanced dye-absorbing efficiency.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In recent years, titania semiconductor has been 
extensively studied and considered as a promising material for 
solar cells, photocatalyst, sensors and biomaterials. Anatase 
form of the titania is capable of generating electron-hole pairs 
via the photovoltaic effect. Photovoltaic conversion efficiency 
can be enhanced by properly absorbing a specific dye to 
promote electron-hole separation [1]. For better dye-absorbing, 
titania electrode with nanostructure and very high specific 
surface area can be constructed by nano-sized titania powders 
as first demonstrated early in the 1990s [2]. The assembled 
solar cell from nanostructure titania is known as dye-sensitized 
solar cell (DSSC) and has the potential to fulfill future 
sustainable and affordable energy demand. A number of 
techniques have been reported to produce nanostructure titania 
layer. These include electrochemical deposition [3], screen 
printing [4], sol-gel route [5] and hydrothermal method [6].  
It should be noted that some of recently developed 
surface modification techniques, in addition to the 
aforementioned techniques, are possible as alternative routes to 
develop nanostructure titania layer with benefits of low 
temperature processing in contrast to those given techniques 
that post annealing are required. One of them may be the 
electrochemical technique, where metal titanium can be 
converted into titania layer. For conventional anodic oxidation, 
attempt to produce titania nano-tube over metal titanium has 
been done and proved to be effective [7]. Much attention has 
recently been drawn in the field of surface engineering to the 
novel anodic oxidation technique using micro-arc oxidation 
(MAO), which can trace back to the first discovery by 
Günterschultz and Betz in early 1930s [8]. The anodic oxidation 
of an MAO technique involves the anodically charging of a 
metal in a specific electrolyte to reach a critical value, dielectric 
breakdown takes place and initiates micro-arc discharges over 
the entire metal surface. The micro-arc discharge enables rapid 
oxidation of the metal piece due to impact or tunneling 
ionization [9]. MAO is a relatively convenient and effective 
technique for producing various functional coatings with 
mesoporous structure on metal surface. Moreover, it provides 
strong film adhesion and satisfactory mechanical strength for 
modifying various metal substrates with complex geometry. 
Crystal structure and morphology of the oxide layer can be 
manipulated by proper control of treatment parameters [9].  
Tremendous work has been done to reveal microstructure 
of the MAO grown oxide layer. Extensive applications have 
been proposed for corrosion resistance, wear protection [10] 
and biomedical purposes [11]. Regardless of the MAO 
treatment parameter, feature of microscale pore presented in the 
oxide layer until recently, Zhou et al. proposed a post alkali 
treatment of the Ti6Al4V plate after MAO treatment. The 
modified layer exhibits nano porous surface composed of 
numbers of titania nano-flakes with better biocompatibility [11]. 
This motivates the study to investigate the growth of nano-flaky 
titania on pure metal titanium by using such a technique. The 
treated metal titanium was assembled into a DSSC to measure 
its photovoltaic efficiency and the feasibility of photovoltaic 
application was revealed. 
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Grade II commercial pure titanium plate (25×25×1 mm3) 
was used as the substrate. It was anodically charged by a dc 
power supply and a stainless steel plate was used as the cathode. 
This is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Prior to MAO treatment, 
proper precleaning of the substrate was carried out. Sodium 
dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate (NaH2PO4·2H2O, 6.24 g/l) was 
dissolved and used as the electrolyte. Voltages across the range 
of 400-500 V were applied to the substrate, respectively for 60 
min with bath temperature kept at 25 °C. After MAO treatment, 
the specimens were treated in NaOH solution (1.25-5.0 M) at 
room temperature for 24 h to develop the desired nano-flaky 
titania, followed by gently cleaning in distilled water and dried. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the MAO equipment. 
 
Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, 
HITACHI S4800) was used to observe surface morphology of 
the specimen. Crystal structure of the MAO film and post alkali 
treated nano-flaky titania layer were also analyzed by using 
X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8SSS) with a CuKα 
radiation at a continuous scanning speed of 6°/min. 
The MAO treated specimen and post alkali treated 
specimens were first sensitized over-light at room temperature 
in N3 dye (RuL2(NCS)2, L=2,2’-bipyridyl-4,4’-dicarboxylic 
acid) ethanol solution (3×10-4 M) for 24 h. The redox

Microstructure of the titania after alkali treatment 
Surface morphology of the post-alkali treated specimens at 
different NaOH concentration is shown in Fig. 6. As can be 
seen, the surface exhibits numerous nano-flakes of 50-100 nm 
in dimension. These nano-flakes uniformly distribute over the 
entire surface of post-alkali treated specimen. Quite obvious is  
that the dimension of the developed nano-flake is determined 
by NaOH concentration of the alkali solution. The nano-flakes 
developed in 1.25 M NaOH solution exhibits the smallest size 
(50 nm) as shown in Fig. 6 (a). This shall be associated with the 
complicated dissolution and re-precipitation mechanism that 
involves the attack by hydroxyl groups and negatively charged 
HTiO3⎯ions formed on the surface. The HTiO3⎯ ions could 
consequently be attracted and dissolved by the positively 
charged ions in the NaOH solution [13]. The low concentration 
NaOH solution gives rise to diffusion control mode for charged 
ion exchange between MAO specimen surface and alkali 
solution, where limited ion flux facilitate a low reaction rate 
which favors fine structure formation.  
 
Photovoltaic behavior of the cell assembled by MAO 
treated specimen and post alkali treated specimen 
Fig. 7 presents I-V curves of the cell assembled with MAO 
treated specimen and post-alkali treated specimens in different 
NaOH concentration as back electrode. The corresponding 
photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. By 
contrast, short-circuit current (Isc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) 
of the assembled solar cell is substantially increased by 
post-alkali treatment as shown in Fig. 7. Apparently, the 
dramatic increase in Isc and Voc of the cell assembled by 
post-alkali treated specimens is contributed by the nano-flaky 
surface structure, which possesses far higher specific surface 
area than MAO layer does. A close look at Fig. 7 (b), (c) and 
(d), the cell assembled by the post-alkali treated specimen at 
1.25 M NaOH solution performs the highest Isc and Voc among 
the three post-alkali treated specimens. This shall be associated 
with the size of the nano-flakes, which is the smallest one that 
developed in 1.25 M NaOH solution. There should be no doubt 
that a smaller size of the nano-flakes brings out a larger specific 
surface area and allows more dye absorbing, thus higher 
photovoltaic efficiency. With this simple and low cost 
post-alkali treatment demonstration, it should be able to 
significantly increase photovoltaic efficiency of the MAO 
treated metal titanium plate when considered using it as the 
back electrode of a DSSC [3].

4. CONCLUSION 
 
An irregular nano-flaky anatase titania layer was 
successfully formed on the surface of the titanium substrate 
with a combinatorial method composed of micro-arc oxidation 
and post-alkali treatment. It shows that the dimension of the 
nano-flakes is determined by NaOH concentration of the alkali 
solution. Apparently, the dramatic increase in Isc and Voc of the 
cell assembled by post-alkali treated specimens is contributed 
by the nano-flaky surface structure, which possesses far higher 
specific surface area than MAO layer does. With this simple 
and low cost post-alkali treatment, it should be able to 
significantly increase photovoltaic efficiency of the MAO 
treated metal titanium plate when considered using it as the 
back electrode of a DSSC.

Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been drawn much attention due to its wide band gap structure and ease of dye absorbing that 
enabling a successful construction of hetro-junction solar cells. The difficulty to commercialize such devices lies in the usage of 
liquid electrolyte for hole carrier transportation, i.e. p-type layer. In this study, an arc ion plating (AIP) system was used to prepare 
double-layer TiO/TiO2 coatings as the p-n junction, where the n-type layer was intentionally deposited at an oxygen-rich atmosphere 
and the p-type layer was purposely deposited at an oxygen-deficient condition. Crystal structure and electrical properties of each 
layer were studied. The dark I-V curve of this p-n junction was measured. 
Experimental results show that n-type TiO2 layer deposited with oxygen-rich conditions induces an increase in degree of film 
crystallinity. The character of p-type deposited titanium oxide (TiO) layer can only appear when a relatively low oxygen partial 
pressure is employed during deposition. The double-layer TiO/TiO2 junction was fabricated with a successive deposition of p-and 
n-type layer by AIP. The dark current obtained from I-V curve exhibits a p-n diode feature. 12% external quantum efficiency (EQE) 
under 385- nm monochromatic irradiation was measured.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Solar energy is a perpetual and clean power which is 
recognized by public, in the shortage crisis of fossil fuels, the 
research of solar cell is overwhelming. According to the material 
which was used by solar cells may be grouped into three 
categories: inorganic solar cell, organic solar cell as well as the 
mixture of inorganic and organic. In the category of inorganic 
material used such as silicon-based and compound have the 
following advantages including long lifetime as well as high 
conversion efficiency, but have complicated material isolate 
process, high consumption of power and high selling price 
relatively .Therefore, the cells have limited widespread use. In 
organic solar cell system basis of organic material used such as 
emerging dye-sensitized solar cell, DSC has the advantage of 
low-cost of manufacturing. However, the material used 
liquid-state process may limit device stability and long lifetime, 
in order to solve the above problems by the development of low 
cost and long lifetime have been necessary for solar cells. 
Solar cells utilize the energy from the sun solar radiation 
directly into electricity. Solar cells are also called photovoltaic 
device by p-n junction type which is commonly used, and 
become one of the major construction for it. The semiconductor 
material used、structural design and film properties will be one of 
the great factors for performance of these photovoltaic. 
At the present, the application of element semiconductor 
such as silicon by high concentration in-diffusion of phosphorus 
process at high temperature in silicon solar cell manufacturing 
form p-n junction. Compound semiconductor for example GaAs 
or InP has limited used in space because the materials high-cost 
[1]. Other Compound semiconductor, their applications have 
been limited to prepare the big area solar cells such as CuInGaSe 
(CIGS) by vacuum technique. Therefore, development of a new 
material be required low temperature、low-cost、easy process by 
the control of parameters, the continuous deposition p-n junction 
double layers will become the direction of this research. 
Titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) of low-cost was chosen as subject to the 
study. In addition to application its unique properties as a n-type 
semiconducting oxide in domain of photocatalysis, it has been 
developed and applied extensively such as photocatalyst , solar 
cells, sensors and biomaterials. TiO2 exists in three 
polymorphous forms: rutile, anatase and brookite. When the 
Anatase is illuminated by light-induced, electron–hole pair is 
generated. The charge separation results induce photovoltaic 
effect for application of solar cells. 
On the other hand, to develop TiO2 matching 
semiconducting oxide of p-type will become the key of 
photovoltaic device   
In a recent paper [2], Pure titanium oxide (TiO) layer 
exhibit p-type behavior. A range of techniques, like PVD, IBAD 
or ablation are employed, to prepare TiO films [3]. For example, 
conductive property of the film changed to p-type electrical 
conduction by W-doped films TiO by RF sputtering was 
achieved. However, the film was annealed at temperatures over 
600℃ enables crystallization [4]. Therefore, in this study, an arc 
ion plating (AIP) system having the following advantages such 
as clean process, relatively uncomplicated, speedy deposition, 
low temperature as well as low-cost which shall be used to 
prepare double-layer TiO/TiO2 coatings under the control of low 
oxygen partial pressure p-type TiO and n-type TiO2 layer which 
is under oxygen-rich conditions form the p-n junction. At last, to 
coat titanium layer as electrode produce n-type TiO2/ p-type TiO 
solid-state photovoltaic devices.  
 
2.  EXPERIMENTAL 
 
Devices were fabricated by glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ 
n-type TiO2/ p-type TiO/ Ti. Fig.1 shows the ideal photovoltaic 
device.   
 
 
Fig.1. Schematic diagram of the ideal photovoltaic device 
assembled in this study. 
 
ITO glass substrate with sheet resistance 20 Ω was cut into a 
dimension of 30 mm × 40 mm. 5 mm Scotch tape will be used to 
cover ITO glass as electrode before coating. TiO2 thin films and 
TiO were deposited on ITO glass substrate by AIP deposition 
was carried out in a common type system. This is schematically 
shown in Fig. 2. The goal of this device is to be used to prepare 
double-layer TiO/TiO2 coatings under the control of low oxygen 
to show p-type property when Hall voltage of TiO film 
appearance positive at the Ar:O2 ratio is 9:1; other are 
appearance negative. As a result, the other TiO films were 
appearance n-type property. 
 
Photovoltaic device and I-V characteristic measurement 
The p-type TiO layer was prepared by AIP and the Ar:O2 
ratio were 8:2, and 9:1 respectively. The n-type TiO2 deposition 
at previously TiO layer as a double-layer p-n junction, after that 
coating Ti layer as a electrode, it is complete device, and 
Schematic shown in Fig.5. The I-V characteristic of the 
photovoltaic device was be measured by potentiostat, and as can 
be seen in Fig.6, the characteristic of device at without the light. 
Fig.6.[8,9] shows that the (a) device without dark current 
completely and (b) device to shown a characteristic of p-n 
junction, in addition the relationship curve between the voltage 
and the current could be detect from dark characteristic of 
photovoltaic device.

External quantum efficiency 
 
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Glass/indium tin  
oxide (ITO)/ n-type TiO2/ p-type TiO/ Ti device is shown in 
Fig.7. The % EQE is the percentage of electrons, measured under 
short circuit current conditions, related to number of incident 
photos and was used to obtain information on the number of 
photons of different energy that contribute to the charge 
generation in the solar cell [10].The photovoltaic device shows a 
maximum EQE of 12% at 385 nm, with a contribution to the 
photocurrent from the TiO2 and TiO counterparts. The peak in 
EQE spectrum at about 385 nm results from absorption of TiO2 
and hole transfer to the TiO.

4.  CONCLUSIONS 
In summary, glass/indium tin oxide (ITO)/ n-type TiO2/ 
p-type TiO/ Ti devices were fabricated by AIP with external 
quantum efficiencies about 0.41%. TiO film is confirmed that 
with decreasing oxygen partial pressure, the conductive property 
of the film changed to p-type electrical conduction. It is found 
that TiO film obtained in low oxygen partial pressure generates 
micro-drops. The transport pathways be limited induce a very 
low conversion efficiency. In order to improve the efficiency in 
this device, the micro-drops must be reduced to improve device 
efficiency.

The MAO treated specimen and post alkali treated 
specimens were first sensitized over-light at room temperature 
in N3 dye (RuL2(NCS)2, L=2,2’-bipyridyl-4,4’-dicarboxylic 
acid) ethanol solution (3×10-4 M) for 24 h. The redox 
electrolyte for the DSSC was prepared by dissolving 0.5 M LiI, 
0.05 M I2 and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium iodide in a solvent 
(volume ratio 1:2 of propylene carbonate : ethylene carbonate).

glass with redox electrolyte in between to form a 
Ti/[TiO2-nano-flake (N3 dye)]/I2+LiI electrolyte/Pt/ITO/glass 
solar cell with an active area 100 mm2. It was then irradiated by 
a Xenon lamp which provides a light intensity 6 mW/cm2.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Microstructure of the titania obtained by MAO treatment 
XRD patterns for the MAO treated specimens prepared at 
different applied voltages are shown in Fig. 3. The MAO film 
mainly consists of anatase titania phase when treated below an 
applied voltage of 450 V. Over an applied voltage of 500 V, the 
anatase phase is prohibited, while rutile phase is gradually 
increased. Literatures have shown that this is ascribed to the 
thermal energy delivered by the micro-arc discharge [9]. Higher 
electric power accompanied with higher applied voltage 
delivers larger amount of thermal energy onto specimen surface 
and thermodynamically favors the formation of rutile phase. By 
contrast, the metastable anatase phase shall preferentially grow 
on a substrate surface at lower temperature brought about by the 
less amount of thermal energy when applied voltage is kept at a 
low value. This encourages the feasibility of this process to 
grow titania with exact phase at low temperature. 
Fig. 4 presents the surface morphology of titania layer 
obtained at different applied voltage. Typical porous surface 
layer is observed with the pore featuring a dimension in 
microscale, regardless of the applied voltage. One thing 
differentiable is that the pore size is larger for the titania layer 
obtained at the applied voltage of 500 V, which is the voltage 
that begins to form rutile phase. This corresponds to the critical 
voltage for thermal energy to dominate the titania growth via 
the mechanism of thermo-chemical ionization [9].  
Fig. 5 presents the influence of the treatment time on the 
current density of the specimen and MAO layer thickness under 
various applied voltage. The current density presents a rapid 
drop in the first several minutes, regardless of the applied 
voltage. Ten min afterwards, the current density reaches a 
minimum steady value. This can be explained on the basis of 
the ‘electrical double layer’ [12] where the as-grown MAO 
and the electrolyte, amplify the resistance of the double layer, 
therefore a steady state minimum current density is rapidly 
achieved. It is interesting to note that a rapid growth stage of the 
titania film occurs within first 20 min, showing a delay response 
to the time for rapid current density drop. This is ascribed to the 
rapid titanium ion dissolution in the electrolyte (instead of oxide 
formation) accompanied with large current density in the first 
several minutes. 20 min afterwards, titania layer formation rate 
is dynamically counterbalanced by dissolution of the formed 
titania in each event of micro-arc spark, as the conventional 
anodic oxidation behaves. This facilitates an ultimate layer 
thickness for each applied voltage as shown in Fig. 5. Although 
there is not much layer thickness difference in the three 
specimens obtained at different applied voltage, rutile phase 
however coexists in the MAO layer for the specimen treated by 
an applied voltage of 500 V (as shown in Fig.3). This gives a 
reason to choose the MAO treated specimen obtained at an 
applied voltage of 450 V to develop nano-flaky surface by 
post-alkali treatment.

An arc ion plating (AIP) deposition system was employed to produce metal titanium layer on transparent conducting oxide glass, 
and followed by anodically oxidizing to form a TiO2-nanotube array electrode. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) was then assembled 
as ITO glass/[TiO2-nanotube (N3 dye)]/I2+LiI electrolyte/Pt/ITO glass. Anodizing bath composition was varied, and post annealing 
was carried out. Consequent changes in the TiO2-nanotube array microstructure and photovoltaic efficiency of the assembled DSC 
device were revealed. 
Experimental results show that a 5-μm thick metal titanium layer can be obtained after 45 min AIP deposition. The metal 
titanium layer underwent complete conversion into XRD-amorphous TiO2-nanotube array after anodic oxidation for 2 h. The tube 
can reach 10.7 μm long with tube inner diameter 92 nm. The ammonium fluoride in the anodizing bath accelerates the tube growth 
rate. Thermal annealing at temperatures over 250℃ works best on anatase crystallization of the TiO2-nanotube. An ultimate 
photovoltaic efficiency 1.88% (active area 1 cm2) of the assembled DSC device can be obtained for the TiO2-nanotube grown ITO 
glass annealed at 350℃.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The rapid shortage of petrochemical energy has led to the 
great demand in developing clean and renewable energy 
sources; such as solar cells in these years. Recent development 
of solar cells in dye-sensitized type devices is one great step 
forward in the field. The dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC) take 
advantages in simple fabrication technique and low production 
costs. With suitable dye absorption, the photovoltaic efficiency 
is reported to reach over 10% [1-3]. Mostly considered DSC 
under development is the titanium dioxide based device, where 
microstructure of the titanium dioxide electrode is essential to 
the photovoltaic efficiency of this kind. Large specific surface 
area provided by the mesoporous TiO2 electrode is the key to 
the effective dye absorption [2]. Cost effective manufacturing 
[1,4] of the mesoporous TiO2 electrode though, researchers 
suggested that one dimensional nano-structured TiO2 such as 
nano-rod, nano-wire or nano-tube is an alternative approach 
for higher photovoltaic efficiency [5-7] due to straightforward 
diffusion path of the free electron once being generated. 
TiO2-nanotube fabrication techniques so far being 
proposed include template replica process [7], sol-gel method 
[8], hydrothermal method [9] and anodic oxidation method 
[10-14]. Among which anodic oxidation is one promising 
route to prepare long and highly ordered TiO2-nanotube array. 
This has been recently demonstrated by Shankar et al who 
fabricated TiO2-nanotube array on titanium foil with tube 
length up to 220 μm [14]. This technique may potentially be 
applied as a back-side illuminated DSC which should be 
predestined to sacrifice certain amount of incident light when 
traveling through electrolyte. On the other hand, direct growth 
of TiO2-nanotube array on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) 
glass substrate for purpose of constructing front-side 
illuminated DSC is proposed by anodizing a pre-sputter 
deposited layer on TCO [12]. Lower deposition rate of the 
metal titanium pre-layer and poor film adhesion has limited 
TiO2-nanotube length within 1 μm and unsatisfactory for 
practical application.  
This study demonstrates the pre-deposition of metal 
titanium layer on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass by using arc ion 
plating (AIP) followed by anodic oxidation to produce 
TiO2-nanotube array. Post annealing of TiO2-nanotube array 
prepared ITO glass samples were carried out and assembled as 
ITO glass/[TiO2-nanotube (N3 dye)]/I2+LiI electrolyte/Pt/ITO 
glass to reveal the effectiveness of such a photovoltaic device. 
The advantage of AIP includes low deposition temperature, 
high deposition rate and strong film adhesion [13] and thus 
long and strongly adhered TiO2-nanotube array is expected to 
be developed with high photovoltaic efficiency. 
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
ITO glass substrate with sheet resistance 20 Ω was cut 
into a dimension of 20 mm × 40 mm. AIP deposition was 
carried out in a common type system. Deposition parameters 
are listed in Table 1. The anodic oxidation bath contains 
ethylene glycol (EG), ammonium fluoride and H2O as seen in 
Table 2. For TiO2-nanotube growth, the titanium pre-deposited 
ITO glass was immersed in the bath and anodically applied 
with a voltage of 60 V for 2 h. After that, the samples were 
rinsed in deionized water and dried. Some of them were post 
annealed at 150℃, 250℃, 350℃ and 450℃ for 2 h for 
comparison.
