Hard Transparent Conducting  
Nanostructured Multi-element Complex Oxide Films 
 
Abstract 
 
This research program has studied the processing and characterization of nanostructured 
titania-based oxide and multi-element complex oxides with outstanding mechanical and functional 
properties, e.g., hard, transparent, semiconducting or conducting oxides, and to establish the 
relationship among processing, structure, composition, properties and performance.  We have 
successfully sputter-deposited the oxide films of titania(TiO2) 、Nb-doped titania (TNO)、alumina 
(Al2O3) and Alx(0, 0.5,1-4)CoCrCuFeNi using a single target or multi-targets of pure element or alloy 
materials in a mixture of argon and oxygen gases and obtained very interesting results. With the 
increasing oxygen fraction in the sputtering atmosphere, the structures of some oxide films 
transformed from crystalline to amorphous and back to crystalline. Various innovative processing 
methods have been used to prepare many new titania based materials of different composition, 
phase, structures or forms, including pure TiO2, anion- and cation-doped TiO2, and sculptured 
mesoporous titania. Some of these materials exhibited enhanced functional properties for 
applications in visible-light driven photocatalyst, TCO and DSSC.  
Hard transparent oxide films of hex-element AlxCoCrCuFeNi and pure alumina were deposited 
by reactive direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering and had nanoindentation hardness values as 
high as 41 and 40 GPa, respectively. These hardness values exceed the highest hardness of any 
oxide material ever reported. The composition–property relation of the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films 
was investigated by changing the aluminum molar ratio, x value, from 0, 0.5, 1 to 4. Both 
multi-element oxide and alumina films possess nanocomposite structures with nano-crystallites 
embedded in an amorphous matrix. The hex-element oxide films comprise only a nano-sized cubic 
spinel phase without other accompanying crystalline oxide phases while the alumina film contain 
gamma and/or delta alumina mixed phases. The strong Al-O bonding and the nanocomposite 
structure are the two main reasons why both the oxides possess extreme hardness. 
Niobium-doped titania (TNO) films were deposited by reactive co-sputtering of Ti and Nb metal 
targets. Nb content in the TNO films was varied from zero to ~23 atomic percent (at.%) by modulating the 
Nb target power from zero to 250 Watts (W). The as-deposited TNO films were all amorphous and 
insulating, after annealing at 600 
o
C for one hour in hydrogen, they became crystalline and conductive. The 
annealed films crystallized into either pure anatase or mixed anatase and rutile structures. The as-deposited 
and the annealed films were transparent, with an average transmittance above 80%. Pure anatase TNO film 
with Nb 9.7 at.% exhibited n-type semiconducting behavior, with a dramatically reduced resistivity of 9.2 x 
10
-4
 Ω cm, a carrier density of 6.6 x 1021 cm-3 and around 1.0 cm2V-1s-1 mobility. The properties of TNO 
films are close to those of indium tin oxide (ITO) films, the most commonly used TCO. This work 
demonstrates that the crystallinity of anatase phase, oxygen vacancies, and Nb dopants are all important 
factors in achieving high conductivities in TNO films.

一、 摘要  
在本研究中使用三靶槍共鍍離子輔助反應性直流濺鍍系統在不同的氧氣與氬氣比例(R=0.5 與 1.0)來製備
AlxCoCrCuFeNi 氧化物薄膜(x=0~4)。當 R=0.5，x 值較低時，剛製備好的薄膜為立方-尖晶石結構且有非常細的
晶粒。當 R=1.0 且 x 值較高時，晶粒會變得更細而形成非晶結構。AlxCoCrCuFeNi 氧化物薄膜的硬度會隨著 R
與 x 值的增加而提升。最大的硬度會達到 41.08±2.48 GPa (在 x=4, R=1.0 時)。使薄膜硬度提高有兩個可能的
原因：鋁含量的提高在薄膜中與氧形成較強的鍵結，第二是極細微的晶粒被嵌入在非常強的非晶基地中，因而
限制了差排的形成與移動。同時在本研究中意外的發現，氧化鋁的硬度亦可以達到 40.61±4.83 GPa。從結構分
析是非晶氧化鋁的結構，但是過去的文獻報導非晶的氧化鋁最高硬度約為 9~10 GPa。即使是α-Al2O3 也僅約
30 GPa 左右。利用 TEM 解析本研究所製備出的氧化鋁結構之後，發現為奈米複合結構，如此高的機械性質正
可以得到解釋。 
 
二、前言 
 一般而言氧化物的機械性質並不是非常的突出，而氧化物硬度的優劣可由元素所形成氧化物的離子性來判
斷。離子性越高的氧化物，機械性質越高，如：Cr2O3, Al2O3…上述兩種氧化物 Cr2O3硬度可以達到 30 GPa 左
右[1]，α-Al2O3也有 30 GPa 左右的值[2]。因此在本研究中利用高熵合金靶與鋁靶在含氧的環境下共濺鍍，得到
的氧化物薄膜有令人驚艷的機械性質。其原因在後面會詳述。 
超硬膜應用範圍相當的廣泛。在工業上的用途，如：切削工具或是汽車齒輪等…。在這些工具上鍍上一層
超硬膜，利用超硬膜耐高溫與低摩擦係數的性質。可以增加切削的速率與耐磨擦的能力，進而延長工具的壽命
以降低成本。 
 在早期硬膜的製造是利用 CVD(化學氣相沉積法)，在 1000℃以上的高溫成長[3,4]。這樣高溫的製程會衍
生出兩個重要的缺點。一、1000℃以上的高溫會造成材料中元素偏析，晶粒變大，使得母材性質變差。二、在
薄膜沉積完成後，溫度降到室溫之後。薄膜與母材之間的熱膨脹係數的差異，會造成薄膜內應力增高使得耐衝
擊性變差。因此採用低溫薄膜製程(<300℃)會是較好的選擇[5-10]。

圖三  AlxCoCrCuFeNi 氧化物薄膜剛製備好薄膜的硬度。 
 
從 XRD 的分析中，R=1.0 中發現薄膜具有非晶的性質。但是對於非晶的氧化鋁而言，發現到有異常優異
的機械性質。過去的文獻報導，非晶的氧化鋁的硬度，最高可以達到 9-10 GPa[6]。但是在本工作中發現到氧化
鋁的硬度竟然可以達到~40 GPa，這是令人非常訝異的。過去並未能有非晶的氧化鋁能夠達到這樣的硬度。因
此，為了要更進一步的了解薄膜的細部結構，利用了穿透式電子顯微鏡來解析本工作中在 R=1.0 下非晶氧化鋁
的結構。由圖四中可以觀察到，薄膜中可以看到有黑點的區域。這些黑點在薄膜中是容易觀察到的，差排與晶
粒的影響都會使穿透式電子顯微鏡的電子散射，讓這些黑點產生。所以在此可以初步推測，薄膜有許多細小的
晶粒。
 除了氧化鋁之外，AlxCoCrCuFeNi 氧化物薄膜的機械性質與原先的工作比較起來機械性質也有顯著的提
升。但是與氧化鋁相同的是，利用 XRD 做結構的分析，在 XRD 的繞射圖上並沒有明顯的結構的變化，包括尖
晶石結構。所已在本研究中，沒有觀察到明顯的結構，但是卻有如此優異的機械性質是令人感到非常有趣的。
由圖六可以看出AlxCoCrCuFeNi氧化物薄膜的晶粒也有較細小的現象，在先前的工作中，晶粒的大小約為10~20 
nm，但在本研究中利用共濺鍍所製備出的薄膜大小約為 7~10 nm 左右，從紅色的箭頭中可以看到晶格條紋的
痕跡。因此在上述所提到的極細微的晶粒被嵌入在非常強的非晶基地中，產生了奈米複合結構，也同時在這裡
得到了證明。 
 
五、結論 
 在本實驗中利用共濺鍍方式成功的製備了 AlxCoCrCuFeNi 氧化物薄膜。剛製備完成的薄膜擁有了非常好
的機械性質。原因是剛製備好的薄膜有細化的晶粒與非晶質基地形成了奈米複合結構。因此有較好的機械性質。
而機械性質在 R=1.0, x=4 時硬度最高，達到 41 GPa。彈性模數達到 346 GPa。除此之外，本研究中與過去傳
統使用射頻電源(RF power)來製造氧化鋁薄膜有相當大的不同。過去利用射頻電源(RF)製備的氧化鋁薄膜主要
缺點為濺鍍速率過低。但是在本研究中發現了重要性的突破，利用直流電源(DC)與施加射頻偏壓(RF bias)在試
片座上。得到了奈米複合結構的氧化鋁薄膜，該薄膜具有優異的機械性質其硬度高達到 40 GPa 及彈性模數達
到 350 GPa，其濺鍍速率也比施加射頻電源的做法高。因此，未來可以將此方法應用在工業上。因為濺鍍速率
較快，製程時間縮短產量就會提高。並且可以用更簡便的方式來製作超硬膜。

高硬度透明導電之奈米結構多元複雜氧化物之薄膜 
Nb摻雜量對 TiO2結構與電性的影響 
翁明壽 邢向群 張孝慈 國立東華大學材料科學與工程學系 
計畫編號：NSC96-2221-e-259-010-MY3 
 
一、摘要 
本實驗使用五靶槍磁控濺鍍系統(最高真空 9.4×
10-6 Pa)製作鈮摻雜二氧化鈦(TNO)透明導電膜。基材
於 100℃下所濺鍍出的 TiO2及 TNO 薄膜，在未經過
退火之前，其結構呈現非晶相，光學穿透度於可見光
範圍內約 85%，導電性能不佳，電阻率 106Ω-cm 以
上；但經過 600℃還原氣氛(氫氣)退火過後，薄膜產
生氧空缺並呈現 anatase 結構，TiO2 電阻率驟降至
10-1Ω-cm； TNO 由於 Nb 離子取代比率，電阻率更
可降低至 10-2~10-4Ω-cm。 
此實驗的第二部分為探討退火條件對 TNO 薄膜
光電性質的影響。有一系列的試片先以 650℃大氣熱
處理 8 個小時再使用氫氣熱處理 1 個小時並與直接氫
氣熱處理 1 個小時做比較。有經大氣退火的試片雖然
會有較好的結晶性，但是卻相對難以產生氧空缺，而
含較高鈮參雜的試片表面更會有析出物的產生。這些
都是會嚴重影響薄膜導電性的因素。此實驗利用表面
粗度儀量測其厚度，利用紅外線真空加熱爐於 1atm
下氫氣退火，使用 X 光譜繞射儀量測透明導電膜之薄
膜結構，UV- Visible 量測其可見光穿透率，並利用霍
爾系統量測其電阻率。 
 
二、前言 
透明導電金屬氧化物(transparent conducting 
oxide, TCO)兼具良好的透光性及導電性兩種特性。近
幾年廣泛應用於平面顯示器、觸控面板、發光二極體、
太陽電池、節能玻璃及其他光電產品中，為現代生活
所不可或缺。目前常用的 TCO 分為三大系列，分別
為氧化銦(ITO)、氧化錫(FTO)、氧化鋅(AZO)。其中
氧化銦(ITO)由於透光度高(達 90%)，電阻低(在 10-4
Ω-cm 左右)，化學性質穩定，物理性質耐久，使用最
為普遍。但因銦在地球上之儲量極為稀少，有迅速耗
盡的危險。必須迅速發展其他替代透明導電薄膜材料
已成為學術界及企業界之共識。 
日 本 Furubayashi 等 人 在 2005 年 發 現
TiO2(anatase)摻雜鉭(Ta)或鈮(Nb)具有相當低的電阻
率 2.5×10-4Ω-cm而且膜厚約 100nm時可見光穿透率
約 85%。鈮摻雜二氧化鈦薄膜(TNO) 之材料成本較目
前通用之透明導電薄膜材料氧化銦錫(ITO)為低，且具
高折射率之特性，因此為一種有未來發展潛力的透明
導電材料。另外 TiO2 原本就是備受矚目的光觸媒材
料，透過各種元素摻雜，加上包括透明導電膜在內的
光電性質可產生更多發展。 
 
三、實驗方法 
 本實驗製程採用AJA International Inc.所組裝之
五靶槍磁控濺鍍系統，且外加 Load-lock 運台以維持
腔體之高真空度。主槍體濺度系統為大圓柱體，尺寸
為 30.5 cm (O.D) × 37 cm (H)，所採用真空系統為一
獨立的機械幫浦 (ALCATEL 2010SD)與渦輪幫浦
(ALCATEL TMU261)，而最高真空可達 9.4×10-6 Pa。
Lord-lock系統為長方形腔體，其尺寸為 30.5 cm (L) × 
37 cm (W) × 37 cm (H)，且真空系統也擁有獨立的
機械幫浦(ALCATEL 2005SD)與渦輪幫浦(ALCATEL 
TMH 071P)。五隻靶槍中，其中有三隻為 DC 靶槍其
最高瓦數可達 300W，而剩餘兩隻則為 RF 靶槍其最
高瓦數可達 500W。 
實驗分成兩個部分，第一部分採組合式共濺鍍的
方式製備不同鈮參雜量的二氧化鈦薄膜。首先將基材
固定於基材座後調整至主槍體的中央。製程過程中基
材座不旋轉並只開一個鈦靶和一個鈮靶，分別位於基
材座的左右兩側，如圖一。藉由這樣的安排，此實驗
能製備出一組鈮含量由低到高且均勻分佈的試片。之
後將試片經過氫氣退火後便能分析出當薄膜鈮含量為
Nb/(Ti+Nb)=0.30 時，薄膜具有較好的導電性。  
 本實驗的的第二部分是探討不同退火條件對薄
膜光電性質的影響。根據第一部分的經驗我們製備了
四組不同鈮含量的 TNO 薄膜;其中鈮靶槍的瓦數分別 
圖四是組合式共濺鍍 TNO 薄膜的平均穿透率。試
片在未經過退火處理之前都具有 73％左右的高穿透
率。經過氫氣退火之後可以發現試片 4~7 穿透率突然
的下降。由 XRD 結構分析可知試片 4~7 已經由二氧
化鈦 anatase 結構漸漸轉換成氧化鈮的結晶相，而導
致穿透率下降。試片 1~3 經過氫氣退火後平均穿透率
並沒有下降，仍然保持 70％以上的高穿透率。 
由圖五可知試片在未經過氫氣退火處理之前因為
都是非結晶結構，電子遷移率相對低，導致電阻率高
達 106Ω-cm 以上。經過氫氣退火之後，試片電阻率降
低，其中試片 1~4 因為結晶成二氧化鈦 anatase 結構
電性最好，電阻率下降到 10-3Ω-cm 左右。綜合觀察
EDS 成分分析圖、平均穿透率圖以及電阻率量測圖，
我們可以得到 Nb/(Ti+Nb)莫耳比在 0.30 左右時其穿
透率及導電性都是最好的。 
 
 
 圖五  組合式共濺鍍 TNO薄膜的電阻率量測  
 
 
(二)退火條件對 TNO 薄膜的影響 
根據本實驗第一部分的經驗，TNO 薄膜在
Nb/(Ti+Nb)莫耳比為 0.30 左右時有較好的光電性
質。而本實驗的第二部分就準備了四片不同鈮含量的
TNO 薄膜(Nb 莫耳比為 0.30 左右)，如圖六所視。之
後將 TNO 薄膜進行兩種不同的退火處理：(1)直接氫
氣還原熱處理 600℃，1 個小時，(2) 650℃大氣熱處
理 8 個小時再使用氫氣熱處理 1 個小時。

化鈦 anatase 相，其結晶性隨著鈮靶瓦數增高而變
好。試片經過大氣加上氫氣的兩段式退火後一樣結晶
成二氧化鈦 anatase 相，並沒有與直接氫氣退火有太
大的差異。

晶粒變大、晶界變少時，電子能在薄膜中更輕易的傳
遞，而使電子遷移率上升。反觀，經過兩段式退火的
TNO 薄膜，因為具備更完整的結晶，晶界和晶粒顆粒
明顯使電子遷移率相對下降。試片Nb-90W、Nb-120W
又因為經過兩段式退火後會有奈米顆粒從晶界及薄膜
表面析出的現象，以至於電子在薄膜中難以傳遞，而
使電子遷移率明顯下降。 
 TNO 薄膜中的載子濃度與 Nb 參雜量和薄膜中
氧空缺的數量有正比的關係。而氧空缺的數量又受到
還原氣氛(氫氣)退火的溫度與時間的空置。從圖十(b)
可得知，載子濃度隨著鈮瓦數的增加而增加，另外直
接氫氣退火與兩段式退火中的氫氣退火參數都是 600
℃持溫 1 小時，所以兩種退火的載子濃度並沒有太明
顯的變化。 
 圖十(c)為TNO薄膜晶兩種退火之後的電阻率的
比較。直接氫氣退火因為表面無析出物，電子遷移率
高，而載子濃度隨著鈮瓦數而增加，所以試片 Nb-120
有最好的導電性，電阻率為 1×10-3Ω-cm。反觀，經過
兩段式退火的 TNO 薄膜，因為晶界與晶粒明顯，高
鈮瓦數的試片表面又會有析出物的產生導致電子遷移
率低，使電阻率都比直接氫氣退火的試偏高，導電性
相對差。 
 
五、結論 
由本實驗第一部分的組合式共濺鍍可得知，TNO
透明導電薄膜在 Nb/(Ti+Nb)莫耳比為 0.30 左右時有
較好的光電性質。而經過實驗的第二部分我們可以發
現鈮參雜量的增加可以使薄膜的晶粒增大，以提升電
子遷移率。然而經過兩段式退火之後，高鈮瓦數的薄
膜會有 Nb2O5的奈米顆粒從薄膜表面析出，這些顆粒
會阻礙電子在薄膜中的傳遞使電子遷移率下降，造成
電阻率上升而影響 TNO 薄膜的電性。本實驗電性最
好的試片為 Nb-120W 直接氫氣 600℃退火 1 個小
時，其電阻率為 1×10-3Ω-cm。

2. Experimental
An electron-beamevaporation systemwith a variable glancing angle
and rotating substrate holder was used to prepare highly-ordered,
sculptured porous nano-columnar titanium oxide ﬁlms on ITO glasses
and used them as photoanode in DSSC construction [17]. The electron-
beam evaporation system was assembled by Branchy Vacuum Tech-
nology Co., Ltd (Toayuan, Taiwan). The distance between the regular
horizontal rotation holder and the electron-beam evaporation source is
550 mm. The variable glancing angle substrate holder was installed
from the chamber sidewall and the distance between the GLAD
substrate holder and the normal of e-beam source is 260 mm.
The substrates used are 18×15 mm2, 300 nm thick indium-tin
oxide (ITO) oxide coated, 0.5 mm thick sodalime glass with an as-
delivered resistivity of 15 Ω/sq. The TiO2 ﬁlms are deposited at an
oxygen ﬂow rate of 12 sccm in oxygen atmosphere (1.2×10−2 Pa)
using rutile TiO2 (99.99%) as a source material. A 200 nm thick dense
TiO2 ﬁlm as barrier layer is ﬁrst deposited at a normal incident angle at
a deposition rate of 0.6 nm/s and controlled by a quartz crystal
monitor and at 300 °C maintained by quartz lamps using the regular
substrate holder. Then, the samples are transferred to the GLAD
holder for deposition of porous ﬁlms at 2.0 nm/s constant deposition
rate and at 150 °C substrate temperature. Three series of porous ﬁlms
and a total of 10 different ﬁlms were prepared and their designated
symbols and growth conditions are listed in Table 1. The ﬁrst series, R
series, of constant ﬁlm thickness of 4 μm were prepared with various
substrate rotation rates at 0.17, 0.5, 1.0 and 7.0 rpm under a ﬁxed
incident angle of 86° and the resulting ﬁlms were assigned as Films
R1, R2, R3 and R4, respectively. The other two series, S and T series, of
various ﬁlm thicknesses from 4 or 6 to 10 μm were deposited at a
constant rotation rate of 0.17 rpmwith two different incident angle at
86° and 73°, respectively. In the S series, the ﬁlms of 4, 6, 8 and 10 μm
were assigned as S1, S2, S3 and S4, respectively and in the T series, the
ﬁlms of 6, 8 and 10 μm were assigned as T2, T3 and T4, respectively.
After deposition of the dense and the porous TiO2 layer, the samples
were annealed at 350 °C for 2 h in air.
DSSC comprises a dye-coated TiO2 ﬁlm on a transparent conducting
glass substrate, a Pt-coated counter electrode, and a redox electrolyte.
The titania ﬁlms are then immersed in a dye solution of 5×10−4 M of
N719 (Ru 620-1H3TBA, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in ethanol and kept
at 70 °C for 24 h, taken out, rinsed with ethanol to rid excess or un-
absorbed dye, and then dried on a hot plate for 30 min. To evaluate how
much dye is absorbed on the internal surface of the titania ﬁlm,
procedure to desorb the dye and to quantify thedyewas carried out. The
dye-absorbed ﬁlm is immersed in 3 ml of 0.2 M NaOH solution in
ultrasonic bath for 1 min to desorb the dye. The dye containing solution
is then characterized using an UV–Visible spectrometer and the peak
intensity at 500 nm is used to obtain the relative amount of dye
absorption. Alternatively, the method of dye desorption can be used to
estimate the relative effective internal surface area of a porous ﬁlm.
The dye-coated TiO2 ﬁlm is then bonded to a counter electrode
prepared by sputtering∼100 nmplatinum ﬁlm on a glass plate. A redox
electrolyte of 0.1 M I2, 1.0 M LiI and 0.5 M 4-ter-Butylpyridine in
acetonitile is introduced into the inter-electrode space by capillary
action. A clip is used to hold the sandwiched electrodes together to
complete the cell assembly. Within about 1 h after the ﬁnal cell
assembly, the photovoltaic characteristics of the cell were measured.
The DSSCs incorporated with the ﬁlms from the R, S and T series as
photoanode are designated with the same symbol as the ﬁlms. The
DSSCswere illuminated with a class A Xenon arc solar simulator, which
contains a 1000W Xenon arc lamp. The current–voltage characteristics
of theDSSCsweremeasuredunder the standard conditions at25 °Cwith
air mass 1.5 and power density of 1000W/m2. The solar simulator was
calibratedwitha reference cell calibratedbyNational RenewableEnergy
Laboratory [18]. The overall energy conversion efﬁciency, η, of a solar
cell determines its performance. Three parameters are used to
characterize solar cell outputs including short-circuit current, Isc,
open-circuit voltage, Voc, and ﬁll factor (FF). The FF is calculated from
the ratio of themaximumpower point (deﬁned by the square of the I–V
curve) divided by the product of Isc and Voc. The maximum cell power
output, Pm, is given by Pm=FF×Isc×Voc. The energy conversion
efﬁciency is then given by Pm/Pin, where Pin is the total power input
by the light incident on the cell [19].
3. Results and discussion
The as-deposited titania ﬁlms are amorphous (not shown) since
theywere deposited at relatively low substrate temperature of 150 °C.

smaller than those of the (101) peaks (0.64° to 0.81°) of similar titania
ﬁlms deposited at 350 °C without post annealing in our previous
report [13]. The current ﬁlms by starting with amorphous phase and

Pure and carbon-doped amorphous titania ﬁlms were prepared in an argon–oxygen plasma by reactive
sputtering of a titanium metal target and co-sputtering of a Ti and a graphite target, respectively. The as-
deposited ﬁlms were subsequently annealed in vacuum and in air. The inﬂuence of the annealing
atmosphere and temperature on the composition, phase transformation and crystallinity of the ﬁlms was
systematically studied. The results indicate that carbon incorporated in titania and an oxygen deﬁcient
environment both facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies in titania which favors the phase
transformation to rutile during annealing at low temperatures. A mechanism is proposed to explain why
carbon incorporation and oxygen defects in titania favors the formation of rutile during annealing.

1. Introduction
Titania is a wide-bandgap semiconductor with interesting func-
tional properties such as photocatalysis, electrochromics, electrical
conductivity, etc. It is an important material widely studied and used
in science and industries [1–4]. Titania has several natural poly-
morphs of which the three most common phases are anatase, rutile
and brookite. Anatase with a bandgap of 3.2 eV exhibits the best
photocatalytic performance under UV light irradiation; when doped
with niobium, it possesses a high electrical conductivity close to
indium–tin oxide (ITO) [5]. Manymethods tomodify titania, primarily
to tune its band gap for visible light photocatalysis, have been
reported in the last decade. For this reason, various efforts [3,4,6–8]
have been attempted including titania doped with various metal and
non-metal elements, resulting in changes in crystallinity, phase and
surface structure of titania. For pure titania, most reports suggest that
the photocatalytic performance depends on anatase crystallinity,
whereas doped titania depends on both anatase crystallinity and
dopant concentration.
Based on theoretical predictions and available experimental
results, it is assumed that carbon-doped anatase titania has excellent
photo-response reactivities comparable to nitrogen doped anatase
[3,4]. While the incorporation of carbon depends on the processing
methods, the analysis of carbon species and its concentration as well
as its effect on the structure of titania are still somewhat confusing
and conﬂicting [9,10]. It was reported recently that mixed phases of
anatase and rutile, with or without carbon incorporation, also
exhibited signiﬁcant photocatalytic performance under visible light
[11,12], thus the role of carbon in titania deserves further study.
Temperature, pressure and composition are dominant factors in
phase transformation of materials. Anatase is a metastable phase at
low temperatures. When annealed at temperatures above ~600 °C,
anatase transforms to rutile, although some research pointed out that
a dopant may affect the temperature of transformation from anatase
to rutile [13]. However, the temperature and the transformation
mechanism depend on impurities, grain size, reaction atmosphere,
and synthesis conditions [14–18]. Therefore, phase transformation
and crystal growth in thin ﬁlms and in nanoparticles may happen via
mechanisms distinct from those in bulk materials.
In this work, the effect of carbon and oxygen on the phase
transformation of titania was investigated in detail. This is done by
conducting parallel studies of the thermal annealing effect on
amorphous titania ﬁlms with and without carbon incorporation in
vacuum and in air.
2. Experimental
Amorphous pure titania (a-TiO2) and carbon containing titania
(TiO2− xCx:C) ﬁlms were prepared in a tri-cathode unbalanced-
magnetron sputtering system. Details of the conﬁguration and
operation of the sputtering system were described previously [19].
The amorphous a-TiO2 and TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms were deposited by
sputtering a Ti target and co-sputtering of a Ti and a graphite target,
respectively, in an oxygen–argon plasma. The substrates used were
polished Si (100) and quartz wafers, which were sputter-etched
with argon ions (Ar+) for 10min prior to the deposition to remove
any residual pollutants on the surface. The a-TiO2 ﬁlms were grown
at a Ti target power of 250 W and the TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms at a Ti target
power of 250 W and a graphite target power of 350 W. Both targets
were operated in the dc mode. The input oxygen and argon ﬂow
rates were 7 and 40 sccm, respectively and the working gas

anatase and rutile, respectively, while all the peaks in Fig. 1b and c
belong to either anatase or rutile. In Fig. 1a, the XRD patterns of the a-
TiO2 ﬁlms annealed in air indicate that the ﬁlm stays amorphous after
300 °C annealing, but after annealing at and above 500 °C, a single
anatase phase appears. The annealed pure titania ﬁlms maintain a
single phase of anatase with improved crystallinity as the annealing
temperature is raised to 800 °C. In Fig. 1b, the pure a-TiO2 ﬁlms
annealed in vacuum begin to crystallize with mixed phases of anatase
and rutile at 300 °C. With the increasing annealing temperature, the
ratio of rutile to anatase in the annealed ﬁlms increases and reaches
100% rutile at 600 °C. Fig. 1c and d shows the evolution of the XRD
patterns of the amorphous TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms annealed in air and in
vacuum, respectively. In Fig. 1c, the TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlm stays amorphous
up to 300 °C annealing in air. Single anatase phase appears after
annealing at 500 °C in air. When temperature is raised to 600 °C, trace
of rutile phase emerges, and when temperature is further increased to
800 °C, the rutile content in the ﬁlm increases signiﬁcantly, to over
10%. In contrast, only the single rutile phase crystallization is observed
when annealed in vacuum above 300 °C and the rutile crystallinity
improves with the increasing annealing temperature as shown in
Fig. 1d. The results in Fig. 1 clearly show two effects. When annealing
amorphous titania ﬁlms it is easier to form the rutile phase in vacuum
than in air and carbon containing titania seems to favor the formation
of rutile regardless the annealing temperature.
The O/Ti ratios of the titania samples are estimated from their EDS
spectra (not shown). The results indicate that the as-deposited pure
a-TiO2 ﬁlm has a composition of O/Ti ratio about 2, while the as-
deposited TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlm has an O/Ti ratio slightly lower than 2 and
with ~5 at.% of carbon. After annealing, all the ﬁlms maintain their
O/Ti ratios about 2 except TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms annealed in vacuum of
which the O/Ti ratio decreases. The O/Ti ratio of the TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms
annealed in vacuum at 600 °C decreases to ~1.7, but its carbon content
only drops slightly. In comparison, the carbon content decreased
signiﬁcantly after annealing in air at 600 °C, dropping from 4.9% to
3.7%.
In order to further understand the nature and composition of
titanium, oxygen and carbon present in the ﬁlms, XPS spectra of the
as-deposited and the annealed a-TiO2 and TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms were
recorded. The spectra of the as-deposited and the air-annealed ﬁlms
do not changemuch, but are quite different from those of the vacuum-
annealed ﬁlms. The representative XPS spectra of the ﬁlms are shown
in Fig. 2, in which the as-deposited TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlm and the same ﬁlm
annealed at 600 °C in vacuum are overlapped for direct comparison.
Fig. 2a is the XPS spectra corresponding to the Ti 2p state energy.
Peaks are observed at binding energies of 460 and 465.8 eV, which are
assigned to Ti4+ 2p3/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2, respectively [20,21] and the
peak intensities decrease after annealing. The presence of a small
amount of Ti3+ is also evidenced by the peaks at 458.8 eV and the
peak intensity increases after annealing. In Fig 2b, there are two peaks
for the O 1s state energy, one around 530 eV assigned as Ti–O bond
and the other around 532 eV assigned as Ti–OH bond [20]. After the
annealing, the Ti–O peak decreases but the Ti–OH peak increases. The
Ti–OH contamination is attributed to water absorption on the surface
and the more the TiO2 is reduced, the more the hydrogen will bond to
its surface. Meanwhile the XPS spectra of C 1s state show peaks for
both simple carbon (C–C) and carbonaceous species (C–O and O C–O)
at 285 and above 287 eV, respectively [11,21]. After annealing, the
peak intensity for C–C decreases signiﬁcantly but the peak intensities
for C–O and O C–O carbonaceous species vary slightly.
The amorphous titania ﬁlms (a-TiO2 and TiO2− xCx:C) form an
anatase phase after thermal annealing in air. That the O/Ti ratio
remains a constant value about 2 indicates that ﬁlms are stoichio-
metric in an oxygen rich atmosphere, which favors the formation of
anatase. The O/Ti ratio maintains at a constant value for the pure a-
TiO2 ﬁlms annealed in vacuum, even, if they transform to a mixed
phase of anatase and rutile. For the TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms annealed in
vacuum, it forms a single rutile phase at low temperature of 300 °C,
with a decreased O/Ti ratio and a reduced carbon content. The result
supports the premise that carbon in TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms reacted with
oxygen, created oxygen deﬁcient titania ﬁlm and helped rutile
formation during annealing.

Fig. 5. With increasing annealing temperature, the solubility of carbon
in the titania lattice may increase, and more carbon can be doped in
the titania lattice. When annealing in vacuum, free carbon may react
with oxygen in titania forming volatile carbon oxide species and
generating oxygen vacancies. When annealing in air, free carbon has
the priority to react with oxygen in air so the carbon containing titania
ﬁlm maintains oxygen sufﬁcient condition with the abundant oxygen
supply from air.
We have shown that amorphous titania transforms into anatase in
an oxygen sufﬁcient environment (in air) but into rutile in an oxygen
deﬁcient environment (in vacuum). We have also demonstrated that
incorporation of carbon in titania favors the formation of rutile. These
results suggest that oxygen deﬁciency in titania facilitates the
formation of rutile. The following argumentmay explain the favorable
effect of oxygen vacancies on rutile formation. The basic construction
unit of titania is a TiO6 octahedron and the major difference between
rutile and anatase is the ratio of corner-sharing units versus edge-
sharing units. An oxygen vacancy may destroy two corner-sharing
octahedrons and favor the formation of two edge-sharing units. Since
rutile has a higher ratio of edge-sharing octahedrons than anatase,
under an oxygen deﬁcient condition, the rutile phase is thermody-
namically preferred. Furthermore, the reported average Ti–O bond
length of amorphous titania is 1.90 Å to 2.00 Å [3,4,27], and rutile has
a longer bond length of 1.96 Å than anatase of 1.946 Å. Therefore in
thermal annealing, it takes lower energy for oxygen deﬁcient titania
to form a longer Ti–O bond and thus, favors the formation of rutile.
4. Conclusions
Both the pure and the carbon containing titania ﬁlms annealed in
air transformed into single anatase phase at 500 °C. The pure TiO2
retained a single anatase phase even at 800 °C, while a small fraction
of TiO2− xCx:C transformed into rutile at 600 °C. When annealed in
vacuum, both amorphous pure TiO2 and TiO2− xCx:C ﬁlms started to
crystallize at 300 °C, but TiO2− xCx:C possessed a single phase of rutile
of high crystallinity, while pure TiO2 ﬁlm poorly crystallized into
mixed phases of anatase and rutile. The results indicate that during
annealing, carbon incorporation and oxygen deﬁcient environment
facilitate formation of oxygen vacancies in titania which favors the
phase transformation to rutile.

Hard transparent conducting oxide films of hex-element AlxCoCrCuFeNi were
deposited by reactive direct current (dc) magnetron sputtering using homogeneous
alloy targets. The composition–property relation was investigated by changing the
aluminum molar ratio, x value, from 0.5 to 2. The films comprise only a cubic spinel
phase without other accompanying crystalline oxide phases and exhibit a high hardness
up to 22.2 GPa. A small, negative deviation from Vegard’s law was observed for the
spinel phase, which indicated changes in cation distribution. The optical transmittance
in both the visible and infrared region is increased with aluminum content, however,
together with a loss of film conductivity. The Hall measurements reveal a p-type
conducting behavior for the Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film with a conductivity of
40.1 −1cm−1, a carrier density of 5.81 × 1018 cm−3, and a mobility as high as
43.2 cm2V−1s−1. Moreover, Hall measurements show metallic conduction behavior for
the Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film and thermal activated semiconducting properties for
the Al1CoCrCuFeNi and Al2CoCrCuFeNi oxide films. Combine the crystal field theory
and the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, the decrease of film
conductivity is explained by the decreases of available carriers and mobility due to the
fact that increasing aluminum content reduces the number of conducting cations at
octahedral sites and increases the activation energy for electrical conduction. XPS
analyses also show lots of excess oxygen originated from anion-rich growth condition
in the films deposited at high oxygen partial pressure that produce p-type carriers
lowering the electrical resistivity. The amount of excess oxygen decreases with
increasing Al content and also contributes to the variation of conductivity with x value.
I. INTRODUCTION
Transparent conducting oxide (TCO) thin-film mate-
rials with a combination of desirable properties are suit-
able for many applications. Considerable efforts have
been made and are continuing for a better understanding
of the relationship between structure and electro-optical
properties of these materials and on developments for
new materials, aiming mostly at higher conductivity
along with good optical transmittance.1 Besides the pri-
mary n-type TCOs widely used in the markets [e.g., the
well-known tin-doped indium oxide (ITO)], pursuing p-
type TCOs would open a way to not only a new genera-
tion of transparent electrical contacts for p-type semicon-
ductors, but also, in combination with n-type materials,
to transparent-oxide electronics.1,2 Recent works on
TCOs have started to move from binary oxides toward
ternaries, such as n-type Cd2SnO43 and p-type CuAlO2.4
More complex systems are still rare: the n-type amor-
phous InGaZnO (a-IGZO) suitable for flexible transpar-
ent thin-film transistors (TTFTs)5 is one example. Obvi-
ously, the demands for better materials not only require
the popular way, which just modify known materials by
manipulating them on the nanoscale or by other suitable
processing methods, but also need the development that
moves from simple composition toward more complex
combinations.6
The exploration of advanced materials with multifunc-
tional properties from complex stoichiometry and struc-
ture, although risky, has become popular. In the past few
years, it was shown that alloy films with 5–13 constituent
metal elements could be deposited by sputtering multi-
element alloy targets,7–10 and they showed simple struc-
tures, primary face-centered cubic (fcc), and body-
centered cubic (bcc) phases. Using the multi-element tar-
get and nitrogen as reactive gas, we have successfully
sputter-deposited multicomponent nitride films. In this

observed in the MnCr2–tAltO414 and CuFe2–tAltO415
spinel series, where the lattice constant varied linearly
with aluminum concentration. In the above two cases,
Vegard’s law was obeyed, which suggests the lattice con-
stants of solid solutions were linear functions of their
compositions. However, small negative deviation was
found in the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films, as shown in
Fig. 1. Romeijn16 suggested that, in the formation of
solid solutions of spinels, Vegard’s law is obeyed only
with the same type of ionic distribution. Negative devia-
tions may occur when (i) the same ion occurs at different
crystallographic positions with a different chemical bond
and (ii) in the solid solution a pattern of order persists,
although one of the components is normal. An XY2O4
spinel is called normal when all of the X ions occupy the
tetrahedral sites and the Y ions the octahedral sites, de-
noted by X[Y]2O4. Another extreme possibility is the
inverse spinel in which half of the Y ions are distributed
at tetrahedral sites and the X ions and the rest of the Y
ions randomly at octahedral sites, denoted by Y[XY]2O4.
Thus, according to the Romeijn’s surmise, the AlxCoCr-
CuFeNi oxide films should have, at least, a certain degree
of inversion in nature. This will be discussed further in
the following x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analysis.
The scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive
spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis shows that the com-
position of oxide films differs from the alloy films, and
the difference is not as significant as illustrated in Fig. 2.
The aluminum content rises as the alloy films become
oxide films and the amount of chromium decreases sig-
nificantly for the films with high x value. This is unex-
pected since oxygen reacts rapidly with both aluminum
and chromium on the target surface and should contrib-
ute to a decrease of both aluminum and chromium con-
tents in the films. Detailed study of the composition
change on the target surface is needed. Other metallic
elements remain about the same ratios from each other.
This means the oxide films are multicomponent in nature
as claimed. The oxygen content for the oxide films is
about 60 at.%, which is close to the theoretic value of
XY2O4 structure (57.1 at.%).
According to the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1, amor-
phous phase may exist in the oxide films. Investigation of
the structure of the Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film using
TEM showed evidence of the existence of amorphous
phase along with nanocrystalline spinel phase, i.e., a
nanocomposite structure.10 A high-resolution TEM im-
age (cross-section view) of the surface of the Al1CoCrCu
FeNi oxide film was taken, as shown in Fig. 3. Fine
grains, with an average size of around 10–20 nm, show
distinct lattice fringes and are surrounded by amorphous-
like matrix. No additional crystalline phase was identi-
fied using the electron diffraction technique. No obvious
compositional deviation could be observed in a nano-
meter scale (using nanobeam EDS technique in TEM).
Because the TEM observations on the Al0.5CoCrCu
FeNi10 and Al1CoCrCuFeNi oxide film (Fig. 3) show
great portions of fine crystals with sharp fringes, we be-
lieve that the weak XRD peaks do not come totally from
poor crystallinity (or amorphous phase), but partly from
the lattice distortion caused by mixing of the six ele-
ments. Tong et al.11 have shown that random occupation
of variously-sized atoms on lattice points in the AlxCoCr-
CuFeNi alloy system, just like the thermal deviation of
atoms from their neutral positions, does weaken the dif-
fraction signals.
Values of hardness of 13.1 ± 2.3, 21.1 ± 1.6, and
22.2 ± 1.5 GPa were obtained (using a nanoindentation
technique10) for the oxide films of AlxCoCrCuFeNi,
where x  0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. The hardness is
enhanced with aluminum content. The Al2CoCrCuFeNi
oxide film shows the maximum value of hardness in this
study. It is a value among the hardest available oxides17–19
and much higher than those of multicomponent ox-
ides20,21 and commercial transparent conducting ox-
ides.22,23 The high hardness may provide higher durabil-
ity in practical applications.
The AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films possess different
transparency and color. The films with half aluminum
content exhibit poor transparency with deep brown
tint, while the films with double aluminum content show
the best transparency and a tinge of light yellow, as
shown in the inset of Fig. 4. These observations are con-
firmed by the films transmittance studied by UV-Vis
spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 4. With increasing x
value, the transparent region extended into the visible

visible transparency and optical band gap as transition
metals are substituted by aluminum in the AlxCoCr-
CuFeNi oxide films.
We found that the FTIR spectra of AlxCoCrCuFeNi
oxide films (Fig. 6) were somewhat similar to the IR
spectra obtained from NiCo2O4 films.37–39 The transmit-
tance of the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films in the range of
900–1100 cm−1 (∼10 m) is ∼68.5%, 70.3%, and 84.4%
for x  0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. It was unexpected,
however, that the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films, which
have six metal elements in the lattice, showed higher
transparency than that of sputtered NiCo2O4 films37
throughout the spectrum and better transparency as com-
pared to the solution-deposited NiCo2O4 films followed
by subsequent annealing.37,38 The inset of Fig. 6 shows a
zoom in the far-IR spectrum. Three small bands at 667,
632, and 610 cm−1 are found, which can be assigned to
metal-oxygen vibration at octahedral sites.40 The rela-
tively weak bands are probably due to high lattice disor-
der that originated from mixing of variant elements and
small film thickness (less materials used in the measure-
ment).
The electrical conductivity of the AlxCoCrCuFeNi ox-
ide films varied as a function of x value is shown in Fig.
7(a). The conductivity of the most conductive oxide film,
x  0.5, is ∼40.1 S/cm (equivalent to resistivity of
∼0.0249  cm). The conductivity decreases dramatically
as aluminum content increases, with 4 orders difference
in magnitude. Since the film structure does not change

properties. For electrical conduction in these oxide ma-
terials, it is generally realized by electron (or hole) trans-
fer along the edge-sharing octahedra. Thus, the type and
valence of cations at octahedral sites play important roles
on the electrical conduction. Duntiz and Orgel44 pro-
posed that the cation distribution for transition-metal ox-
ides could be realized simply by the crystal field stabi-
lization energy (CFSE) of each cation in each site. The
difference between the CFSE on the two competing sites
(tetrahedral and octahedral sites) yields the site prefer-
ence energy. The site preference energy for Al was de-
termined from the measured cation distribution in
NiAl2O4.45 In summary of their calculations and together
with experimental results,16,45–48 we may arrange the
constituent elements in the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxides in the
order of site preference energy at octahedral sites over
tetrahedral sites:
Fe3+0  Cu+NA ∼ Co2+31  Fe2+17
 Co3+NA ∼ Al3+78 ∼ Cu2+64
∼ Ni2+86  Cr3+158 , (3)
where numbers in parentheses are estimated octahedral
site preference energies in kJ/mol.44 Symbol “∼” denotes
comparable octahedral site preference, while the one at
the right side has higher preference than that at the left
side. The real cation distribution could vary with a cer-
tain degree depending on the preparation method and the
history of samples. Therefore, XPS was used to assist the
determination of cation distribution in the AlxCoCr-
CuFeNi oxide films.
Figure 8 shows the recorded and resolved XPS spectra
of the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films at different binding
energy regions. The O1s portion of the XPS spectra, as
shown in Fig. 8(a), reveals two peaks with only about
0.5 eV difference in binding energy. The lower binding-
energy peak at around 530.0–530.2 eV could be attrib-
uted to the normal lattice oxygen in the spinel struc-
ture37,49,50 and the origin of the one with higher binding
energy was controversial. One possible assignment was
defect oxygen within the oxide lattice,37,51 whereas other
ascriptions such as oxygen in the spinel-oxide surface52
or oxygen in the surface hydroxyl groups49,50 were con-
sidered. The last assignment of surface hydroxyl groups
is unlikely because these species should be removed
mostly by argon precleaning before XPS sampling. How-
ever, we cannot rule out the incorporation of hydrogen in
the film from the residual water vapor in the high-
vacuum deposition chamber. We would like to correlate
the O1s spectra with the film resistivity, because the
electrical properties usually strongly depend on the den-
sity of oxygen defect in oxide conductors.37,53–57 Figure
9(a) shows the variation of the ratio of the XPS O1s peak
areas (higher binding energy peak/lower binding energy
peak) with composition (x value) of the AlxCoCrCuFeNi
oxide films. The curve looks very similar to the conduc-
tivity variation of the Ni1–xCoxO4/3 films presented in the
same way.37 The electrical resistivity of both the sput-
tered and solution-deposited (sol-gel) Ni1–xCoxO4/3 films
show strong dependence on the ratio of the XPS O1s
peak areas, which is composition dependent (on x value).
A maximum of the area ratio was obtained in medium x
value (∼0.67, which forms the stoichiometric NiCo2O4).
An almost linear relationship between log resistivity and
the ratio of the XPS O1s peak areas is obtained, as shown
in Fig. 9(b). This phenomenon was also observed in the
Ni1–xCoxO4/3 films. In both cases, the results suggest that
the higher binding energy peak is associated with a struc-
ture promoting higher electrical conductivity in the film.
This peak, as discussed earlier, was treated most likely as
defect lattice oxygen at the surface region.37,51
Figure 8(b) shows the Cr2p XPS spectra. The binding
energy of the Cr2p3/2 peak is 576.7 eV for all three
samples and it matches well with those of Cr3+ species in
the literature.58–60 However, there is a shoulder present
in the Cr2p doublet and hence the curve cannot be fitted
well unless an additional peak at lower binding energy is
added. This peak at 575.3 eV is attributed to the divalent
chromium ions (Cr2+),59 and its amount is composition
dependent: the peak area ratio of Cr2+/Cr3+ decreases
with increasing x value.
The Cu2p XPS spectra in Fig. 8(c) reveals one strong
doublet at binding energies of 932.9 and 952.7 eV for
2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively. These values are close to
the well-known metallic Cu (932.7 eV for 2p3/2) and
∼1 eV lower than CuO (933.6 eV for 2p3/2).58 Kawatsura
et al.61 showed that, using high-resolution XPS, the bind-
ing energy of Cu2p3/2 peak from bulk Cu2O lies very
close to that from metallic copper, with a very similar
satellite feature that is far different from that of bulk
CuO. However, Gillot et al.62 found that cuprous ions,
Cu+, were present at both tetrahedral (over 90%) and
octahedral sites in the RF-sputtered CoxCuyMnzFeuO4+
thin films. This indicates that even if oxide species have
been sputtered, cuprous ions could be found in as-
deposited films. In contrast, Asbrink et al.63 reported that
Cu+ ions were found only at tetrahedral sites in Cu-
GaMnO4 single crystals. Thus, the primary peak in the
Cu2p spectra of the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films should
be attributed to cuprous ions. The curve fitting of the
spectra revealed a second peak at around 934.1 eV,
which matches well with those of CuB2+ ions, i.e., diva-
lent copper ions at octahedral sites.61,62,64–66 We have
discussed the octahedral site preference energies of cat-
ions in the AlCoCrCuFeNi system and with experimental
data in hand, which suggested that CuAl2O4 is partially
inverted spinel,15,64 one may conclude that Al3+ and
Cu2+ have comparable preferences to occupy octahedral
sites, as denoted by “∼” in Eq. (3). The intensity of the
second peak (Cu2+) is much lower than that of the first

J. Mater. Res., Vol. 23, No. 11, Nov 2008 3081
The Al2p core-level spectra in the binding energy
range 72–76 eV overlaps with Cr3s and Cu3p, as shown
in Fig. 8(d). However, it is not fully impossible to reveal
individual peaks in multicomponent materials.65,67 We
deconvoluted the curves using five peaks: Al2p, Cr3s,
Cu3p3/2, Cu3p1/2, and a small satellite (originated from
3d-3s exchange coupling of chromium),68 from low to
high binding energy. The Al2p peak in the XPS spectra
of AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films, with binding energy
around 73.7 eV, most likely be assigned to octahedrally
coordinated Al–O–M bonds.49,50 The Cr3s core-level
spectra was fitted to be at around 75.1 eV, with a satellite
peak that lies at about 4.1–4.3 eV higher than the Cr3s
main line. This is consistent with the data from well-
defined Cr2O3 (Cr3+)69 and is also in good agreement
with the fact that a majority of Cr3+ with minor Cr2+
observed in the Cr2p spectra.
No appreciable change was witnessed in the XPS
spectra for Fe2p, Co2p, and Ni2p core-levels as the Al
molar ratio x changes. The curve-fitting analysis results
are summarized as follows: (i) only Fe3+ cations are pres-
ent (the existence of Fe2+ ions could be ruled out or, at
least, in a negligible amount); (ii) both Co2+ and Co3+
cations are present and the ratio of peak areas (Co2+/
Co3+) is composition independent, with an average value
of ∼65%, 57%, and 63% for x  0.5, 1, and 2, respec-
tively; (iii) the main Ni2p3/2 peak shifted to higher bind-
ing energy (as compared to standard NiO54), which was
caused by either the spinel structure69,70 or the possible
presence of Ni3+ at octahedral sites.38,71 It is worthwhile
to note that the full-width at half maximum (FWHMs) of
all peaks in the XPS spectra recorded from the AlxCoCr-
CuFeNi oxide films are comparable to those of bulk ma-
terials, which strongly supports our surmise that in the
amorphous phase between spinel nanograins, it is imper-
fectly linked octahedra and tetrahedra structure rather
than other noncrystalline structure.
According to the above interpretation of the XPS spec-
tra and the site preference of cations, we estimated the
true cation distribution in the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide
films using the following rule (listed with their priori-
ties):
(i) all of the aluminum, chromium, and nickel ions
occupy most preferentially at octahedral sites;
(ii) cuprous ions (Cu+) fill tetrahedral sites predomi-
nately;
(iii) cupric ions (Cu2+) and trivalent cobalt ions
(Co3+) prefer to stay at octahedral sites;
(iv) divalent cobalt ions (Co2+) have slight preference
filling at octahedral sites;
(v) ferric ions (Fe3+) have no preference at either sites
and thus will occupy any available sites left; and
(vi) the ratio of Co2+/Co3+, Cr2+/Cr3+, and Cu+/Cu2+
is calculated according to the above XPS analyses.
The cation distribution is suggested to be

the number of valence electron, or namely, an increase of
oxidation state.83 This is in good agreement with the
formation of O− and/or Ai−, which is indeed a reduction
process from normal lattice oxygen O2−.
Windisch et al.42 proposed that the Ni1–xCoxO4/3 film
with x  1 − 0.67 conduct electricity via a “small pol-
aron hopping” mechanism due to the characteristics of
high carrier density, low mobility, and high lattice dis-
order. These characteristics do not match well with our
data, where the mobility is high while the carrier density
is insufficient for the AlxCoCrCuFeNi oxide films. To
get an insight into the high conductivity of the AlxCoCr-
CuFeNi oxide films, the temperature-dependent electri-
cal resistivity and Hall coefficients were measured be-
tween 20 and 300 K using the van der Pauw technique.
Unfortunately, the Hall measurements became very dif-
ficult for the Al1CoCrCuFeNi and Al2CoCrCuFeNi ox-
ide films under low temperature due to the significantly
increased electrical resistivity and unexpected thermally-
induced currents (dark currents). Thus, the Hall coeffi-
cients obtained at low temperature for the two films (es-
pecially for x 2) are not reliable. Figure 11 shows the
variation of log 	 as a function of reciprocal temperature.
The Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film shows metallic con-
ductivity throughout the measurement, while the other
two samples exhibit semiconducting (or activated) be-
havior. Note that there exist transition points for all three
samples where the slope changes: 120, 205, and 195 K
for x 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. Moreover, the sign of
the slope changes at the transition point only for the
Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film, which means below 120 K
it is a semiconductor and above 120 K it is a metal.
Interestingly, this happens to coincide with the famous
Verwey transition (metal-insulator transition)75 observed
in magnetite, Fe3O4, where the transition takes place at
around 120 K as well. Yet the resistivity change at the
transition point in our case is significantly minor.

over, the values of activation energy for the native ac-
ceptors in the Al1CoCrCuFeNi and Al2CoCrCuFeNi ox-
ide films are 0.006 and 0.026 eV, respectively, higher
than that in the Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film. The results
presented above suggest that the Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide
film is a degenerate semiconductor, whereas the
Al1CoCrCuFeNi and Al2CoCrCuFeNi oxide films are
thermal activated semiconductors.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that
multicomponent complex oxide films possess higher
hardness, high conductivity with varied visible light
transparency. We showed that the aluminum molar ratio,
x value, plays an important role in the AlxCoCrCuFeNi
oxide system. As x was increased, the optical transmit-
tance in both visible and IR region is increased with,
however, a decrease of film conductivity. The Hall meas-
urements reveal a p-type conducting behavior for the
Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film with a conductivity of
40.1 −1cm−1, a carrier density of 5.81 × 1018 cm−3, and
a mobility as high as 43.2 cm2V−1s−1. Moreover, Hall
measurements show metallic conduction behavior for the
Al0.5CoCrCuFeNi oxide film, and thermal activated
semiconducting properties for the Al1CoCrCuFeNi and
Al2CoCrCuFeNi oxide films. Combine the crystal field
theory and the XPS measurements, the decrease of film
conductivity is explained by the decreases of available
carriers and mobility due to the fact that increasing alu-
minum content reduces the number of conducting cations
at octahedral sites and increases the activation energy for
electrical conduction. XPS analyses also show lots of
excess oxygen originated from anion-rich growth condi-
tion in the films deposited at high oxygen partial pressure
that produce p-type carriers lowering the electrical resis-
tivity. The amount of excess oxygen decreases with in-
creasing Al content and thus also contributes to the varia-
tion of conductivity with x value.

bring up new capacity very rapidly, leveraging the high manufacturability of the CdTe 
platform.  Because of its excellent energy pay-back time, the thin film product is a more 
effective solution to global warming than conventional PV. In 2008, First Solar announced the 
achievement of the long-standing $1/W milestone, with a Q4 production cost all-in of 
$0.98/W.   
There were 1,250 talks and posters at the meeting and I attended some of them related to 
my current research area and interest. There were many discussions and exchanges during the 
sessions and breaks. I learned quite a bit of new facts and ideas, met many people and made 
quite a few new friends. I presented one oral paper in the session of photocatalytic coatings in 
Monday morning and chaired one session on atmospheric plasma in Monday afternoon.  I was 
one of the organizer of the symposium on Advanced Surface Engineering and was the initiator 
and the major organizer of the new session on photocatalytic coatings in the symposium run by 
Division of Advanced Surface Engineering. I invited Prof. Anpo from Osaka Perfecture 
University in Japan to give an invited talk in the session. I myself also gave a contributed talk 
in the session. The session attracted a lot of audiences and was quite successful.   
This year I continued to volunteer to be one of technical program committee member of 
both meetings. I was involved in founding AVS Taiwan Chapter, the first international chapter 
in AVS, in the past years. We had our inauguration ceremony of the Chapter at annual meeting 
of Taiwan Thin Film and Coating Technology Association in Nantow, Taiwan in late October 
2006. Our chapter has been running very well fro more than two years and I am serving as an 
executive member for a second term.  
It was a joy in attending the AVS 56th Symposium, which is one of the highlights of my 
year. I enjoyed very much the outstanding set of technical sessions as well as the social events 
during the meeting. I continue to volunteer to be a program committee member for next year 
and plan to attend the AVS 57
th
 Symposium to be held in Albuquerque, NM, USA, Oct. 17-22, 
2010.

I attended the Technical Program for the 2008 AVS International Symposium in Boston, Mass, 
USA and presented two papers. The AVS International Symposium is one of the premier 
meetings on the calendar for scientists and technologists around the world. The 2008 Technical 
Program continued with the tradition of AVS by addressing a broad spectrum of cutting-edge 
topics that focus on physical and chemical phenomenon occurring at the interfacial regions of 
complex systems and the major themes are: surfaces/interfaces, Nano Science and Technology, 
and the use of controlled environments from vacuum, to plasmas, to biological systems for 
quantitative measurements and processing of materials interfaces. Whether your interests lie in 
traditional fields such as vacuum technology or surface characterization or you are exploring 
emerging topics such as nanotechnology or biological interfaces, AVS provides a quality forum 
to assess the state-of-the-art and look to the future. The AVS Equipment Exhibit and the 
Exhibitors Workshop, featured the latest in products, services and technical information for our 
scientific community.  
This year’s program consisted of 111 oral and 2 poster sessions sponsored by the AVS 
Divisions and Technical Groups as well as 4 Topical Conferences, and 4 Focus Topics. Focus 
Topics are topics that cross the boundaries of several Divisions and Technical Groups. This 
year’s Focus Topics were: Biological, Organic, and Soft Materials; Energy; 
Nanomanufacturing; and Tribology. Topical Conferences included were:BioMEMS; Graphene; 
In Situ Microscopy and Spectroscopy: Interfacial and Nanoscale Science; and 
Synchrotron-based Spectroscopy and Spectro-microscopy. The Symposium Plenary Lecture,

Abstract: 
Amorphous pure and carbon-doped titania films were prepared by reactive sputtering of 
titanium metal target and co-sputtering of Ti and carbon targets, respectively, in Ar and oxygen 
plasma. The as-deposited films were subsequently annealed in vacuum and in air. The influence 
of annealing atmosphere and temperature on the composition, phase and crystallinity of the 
films was systematically studied to understand their effects on photocatalytic activity. Both the 
pure and the carbon-doped films annealed in air transformed into anatase phase at 300℃ and 
retained pure anatase phase even at 800℃; while those annealed in vacuum transformed into 
rutile/anatase mixed phase at 300℃ and into pure rutile at 600℃. Carbon incorporation and 
oxygen deficient environment seem to favor phase transformation of amorphous titania to rutile 
at low temperatures in post-annealing.

one poster papers on Tuesday.  I was one of the organizer of the symposium on Advanced 
Surface Engineering and chaired the session of hard and nanocomposite coatings: synthesis, 
structure, and properties on Monday morning. The session included a total of nine talks 
including two invited talks and lasted for four hours. The session went pretty well, all talks 
finished in time, no equipment problems, and lots of questions, discussions and exchanges.

Abstract 
We adopted a combinatorial approach to develop a series of carbon-incorporated titania 
(TiOxCy) films titania films with composition spread up to 40 at.% of carbon. The films were 
deposited on silicon and quartz substrates by co-sputtering a metallic titanium target and a 
graphite target simultaneously onto a stationary long-strip of substrate in a gas mixture of argon 
and oxygen. The location of substrates in relation to targets and the power of targets are found 
to be very crucial for the desired result.  As the carbon content increases, the film structure 
and crystallinity transform from anatase to amorphous-liked phase and its morphologies and 
microstructures change from rough surface of columnar grains to smooth surface of 
nanocomposite. The carbon is present both in the form of substituted Ti-C bonds in anatase 
grains as well as free graphitic along grain boundaries or in matrix. With increasing carbon 
content, the film optical absorption in visible region decreases first and then increase, while the 
film optical bandgap energy varies from 2.6 up to 3.2, and then descends to 2.5 eV.  On 
photocatalysis under visible light, the film with about ~10% carbon exhibits the largest 
photoreduction of silver-ions to form Ag particles and nano-wires, while the film of the best 
anatase crystallinity with about 3 at％ of carbon has the most degradation of methylene blue. 
The content and the nature of carbon as well as the titania crystallinity dominate the 
visible-light induced photocatalytic activity of the TiOxCy films.

析與量測技術、鍍膜之應用、製造與設備、先進鍍膜的新領域。筆者所發表的 2篇論文
皆是近幾年來頗受矚目的研究課題，故有許多與會者對之感興趣，有多位與會者來與筆
者討論並索取論文的手稿。筆者擔任 5/1日 Sputtering Coatings and Technologies 分
項會議主席，主持 19場論文發表。 
 
 筆者 2006 年獲選為美國真空學會先進表面工程組之理事，並在同年與國內物理 真
空與鍍膜界首創 Taiwan AVS Chapter 為美國真空學會第一個海外分會。於 4月 28日下
午 在大會歡迎宴開始前，我們來自台灣約有 100 餘人先同聚一堂互相認識，大家共度美
好的一晚。 
 
    每年大會不可或少的是廠商展覽會、介紹與鍍膜有關的最新產品與服務。展覽的時
間為 29 與 30 日兩個整天。共有 41個參展的攤位，展出的內容十分豐富。筆者在聽口
頭演講間的空暇，把握時間，拜訪了大部分廠家，索取了許多新的資料。「工欲善其事，
必先利其器」，這些廠家是我們研究者主要的設備技術的來源。 30日晚為正式的大會宴，
所有與會者共聚一堂，享受西餐與美酒，感謝籌辦會議的義務工作人員並慶祝會議的成
功，大家共度美好的一晚。5/1日晚大會所有壁報論文的發表會，所有與會者共聚一堂，
一邊喝啤酒一邊論學術，大家共有溫馨與豐收的一晚。5/2日雖為會議的最後一天，大半
的與會者堅持到最後，互道再見，期盼明年再相會。 
 
     ICMCTF是真正名符其實的國際會議，與會者有超過一大半來自美國本土外的國家，
歐洲來的佔其中的大多數，當中又以德國為多。亞洲國家來的參與者約佔總數的三分之
一，約有 100餘人來自台灣，是歷年來最多的一次。其餘的分別來自日本、南韓、香港、
新加坡、印度等。雖然每年在同一地點舉行，有百分之八十的出席者是和我一樣，不是
為好天氣及好風景而來，是為這個會議本身而來，是會議長期且忠實的參與者。因此之
故與大部分開會的成員皆成為舊識，也發展出許多珍貴的私人友誼及學術合作關係。來
自台灣的與會者是除美國之外最大之團體，約佔總出席者的百分之十五，國內進行與鍍
膜有關之學術研究及產業家數己有不小的規模，足以在國際舞台上佔一席之地。會中有
我們來自台灣十餘人互相討論在未來數年在本會議之議程及活動扮演較積極的主導與參
與之角色。
