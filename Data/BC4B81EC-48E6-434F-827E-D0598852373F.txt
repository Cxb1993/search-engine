CHAPTER 1:  INTRODUCTION 
Filamentous fungi, including the genus Aspergillus, are major producers of enzymes that 
have important applications. Aspergillus awamori is a common fungus used widely in koji-
making for awamori, a traditional Japanese spirits (shochu), and simultaneously produces various 
enzymes including several xylanases and cellulases.  
Feruloyl esterases (FAE) are promising enzymes to have potential contributions in 
research and industry. Microbial FAE acting on plant cell wall polymers represent key tools for 
degradating cell wall polysaccharides, modifing physical and chemical properties of plant cell 
walls and components. There has recently been interest in potential applications of FAE due to 
their roles in many biotechnological processes and in their potential applications in obtaining 
ferulic acid from agro-industrial waste. Two of the problems to commercialize the use of FAE are: 
to date there is no commercial full purified FAE and the lack of sufficient enzyme stocks. Thus, 
efforts have to be made in order to achieve cheap overproduction of FAE in heterologous hosts 
and also their modification by chemical means or protein engineering to obtain more robust and 
active purified FAE-II enzymes.  
One of the more satisfactory criteria for FAE enzyme purification is the nature of its 
solubility curves as the data obtained from this curves will be very useful for determining the 
degree of purity of FAE-II enzyme. The solubility studies would be of great help both for 
research and for the large scale production of the enzyme. Results obtained from the biophysico-
chemical and thermo kinetic studies on FAE will help advancing the use of that enzyme.  
Although recombinant enzymes and native enzymes are manufactured to meet the same 
rigorous quality control standards, it is recombinant enzymes that produce a purer product with 
less processing time. So considering the remarkable impact of FAEs in various industrial and 
medical applications, it is anticipated that the structural studies will provide an initial framework 
for the rational design of novel enzymes with improved biotechnological potential.  
This work describes: (1) Production, partial purification and characterization of FAE by A. 
awamori in submerged fermentation. (2) Studies on temperature dependent kinetics of native A. 
awamori FAE-II in water solutions. (3) Biochemical studies on native and cross-linked 
aggregates of A. awamori FAE-II. (4) Stability and solubility studies of native and activated A. 
awamori FAE-II. (5) Expression of FAE-II from A. awamori in Escherichia coli; characterization 
and crystal studies of the recombinant enzyme.

free liquid. In SSF, productivity per reactor volume is much higher than that in submerged culture 
(Roche et al., 1994). Operational cost is lower (Donaghy and McKay, 1995). Solid culture 
processes are practical for complex substrates including agricultural, forestry, and food 
processing residues and wastes, used as inducing carbon sources for the production of FAEs. A. 
niger (Asther et al., 2002; Panagiotou et al., 2006), different Penicillium sp. (Asther et al., 2002; 
Panagiotou et al., 2006; Donaghy and McKay, 1997; Castanares et al., 1992) and the thermophilic 
fungus Sporotrichum thermophile (Topakas et al., 2003) were capable of producing FAEs when 
grown on agricultural residues such as sugar beet pulp, wheat bran, wheat straw and brewer’s 
spent grain under SSF. Penicillium brasilianum (Panagiotou et al., 2006) was the more effective 
FAE producer under SSF.

estimated as described below. 
3.1.5 Enzyme purification 
The crude cell-free extract was equilibrated by microfiltration (0.45 μl) with 50 mmol.dm-
3 tris-HCl buffer, pH6 and applied onto a DEAE cellulose column (2.5 cm × 25 cm), equilibrated 
with the same buffer. The column was first washed with 1500 ml of 20 m mol.dm-3 tris-HCl 
buffer, pH~6, and then eluted with 200 ml 100 mmol.dm-3 NaCl solution prepared in the same 
buffer. Fractions (50 ml) were collected and two active fractions were collected (the first two 
DEAE-cellulose fractions). The concentrated second fraction was reloaded onto a second DEAE 
column (2.5 cm × 25 cm), equilibrated with the same buffer and a linear gradient (200 ml.h−1) of 
30 mmol.dm-3 NaCl in 1200 ml of the same buffer was applied. Aliquots of the pooled active 
fractions (2nd DEAE-cellulose fraction) were concentrated by microfiltration, equilibrated with 
20 mmol.dm-3 tris-HCl (pH~6). Saturated ammonium sulphate solution (0.8 mol.dm-3) was run 
slowly (about 10 ml/min) from a burette with stirring to a portion (10 ml) of the second DEAE-
cellulose fraction to obtain the desired final salt concentration (Di Jeso et al., 1968).  pH of the 
solution was readjusted if necessary. The two phases were separated by centrifugation at 25,000 
rpm and 6°C for 30 min.  
The results were expressed as total protein or activity from 10 ml extract. This 
purification step yielded one (NH4)2SO4 feruloyl active fraction.  
3.1.6 Enzyme activity assay 
The activity of FAE was assayed by the analysis of FA released from ethyl derivative of 
ethyl ferulate. One unit of FAE activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 1 
μmol FA per minute.   
3.1.7  Biomass estimation 
Indirect method was adopted for biomass determination (Terebiznik and Pilosof, 1999; 
Mitchell, 1992). In this work, we measured the fungal biomass gravimetrically. Culture medium 
was filtered through a Millipore filter (0.45 μm). The mycelium retained was washed with a 
saline solution (NaCl, 0.9%) and samples were dried to constant weight at 60oC for 48 h. 
Biomass concentration was reported as g dry weight per mL culture medium (mg/mL).  
3.2 Biochemical studies of FAE-II 
3.2.1 Cross-linked FAE-II aggregates 
          FAE-II (100 mg per ml) was dissolved in phosphate buffer (0.15 M, pH ~ 6.5). Aggregation 
was achieved with the addition of (NH4)2SO4. Different concentration of (NH4)2SO4 was added 
stepwise at regular intervals with stirring at 10°C. Then the super saturated solution was kept 
undisturbed for 48 h. Enzyme activity of the precipitate was measured. The aggregates formed 
were separated by centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 15 min). One gram of FAE-II aggregates was 
cross-linked by using glutaraldehyde solution at two different concentrations (3 and 5%) in 1-
propanol for 30 min at room temperature. After cross-linking, it was washed several times with 
 7
BL21carrying pT-AwfaeA was grown at 37°C with 200 rpm overnight in LB medium containing 
50 μg/mL kanamycin. When absorbance (OD) at 600 nm reached 0.6, 0.03 mM IPTG was added 
to the culture, which was then incubated for an additional 3 h at 30oC. Next, the expressed 
recombinant cells were harvested from a culture broth by centrifugation (10000g, 20 min) and 
washed twice with 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 6.0). The cells were resuspended in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and stored at −70°C.  
3.3.4 AwfaeA protein extraction and purification 
BugBuster Master Mix Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen) was used to extract the 
expressed proteins from bacterial lysates. The extraction was carried out according to a standard 
procedure (Novagen, User protocol TB245 Rev. E 0304, P.8). The inclusion bodies containing 
AwFaeA in insoluble pellets (precipitate) were washed twice with buffer containing 50 mM Tris–
HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. Solublization and refolding of the 
washed inclusion bodies was carried out using the Protein Refolding Kit (Novagen). The 
solublization buffer was supplemented with folding buffer, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 
correct folding of disulfide bonds and with 1% N-lauroylsarcosine. The solubilized proteins were 
dialyzed against 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 four times at 4°C. After solublization and refolding, the 
recombinant protein was purified by nickel–nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni–NTA) metal-affinity 
chromatography matrices. Ni-NTA superflow resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was packed and 
equilibrated with buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl). The target protein (AwFaeA) was 
eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole from 20 to 200 mM. After concentration of the 
purified target protein (5 mg/ml), refolded AwFaeA was further purified by size exclusion 
chromatography. The concentrated purified protein was stored at −70°C for subsequent analysis. 
Protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford method with BSA (Sigma Co., St Louis, 
MO) as standard (Bradford, 1976). The activity of AwfaeA was assayed by the analysis of free FA 
released from ethyl ferulate.  
3.3.5 AwFaeA crystallization 
A 5 mg/ml solution of the purified recombinant AwfaeA enzyme was used for 
crystallization trials. Setups were made using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, in 24-
well lnbro culture plates with drops on siliconized glass cover slides. The wells were sealed with 
high-vacuum laboratory grease. Drops contained 5 µl AwfaeA enzyme solution and 5 µl 
precipitant solutions from the corresponding 750 µl reservoir. The temperature was 20oC. A 
standard, coarse matrix crystallization screen was used. AwfaeA enzyme crystals appeared under 
the following conditions: 2 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.25 M NaAc, 0.1 M Tris-Cl pH 8.6, 5 days. The 
complex with FA was obtained by soaking crystal in 2 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.15 M tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 25 
mM FA and 10% ethanol for about 2 h.

From findings shown in Table 4-2, we see that Vo increases from 288 K to 328 K and then 
decreases a little from 338 K to 358 K. However, the enzyme is still active even at 368K. As the 
substrate concentration increases, Vo increases up to a certain concentration, and then remains 
constant. Vm increases 7-fold from the minimal temperature (288 K) to the maximal temperature 
(328 K) and almost 2-fold from physiological temperature to 50 K. The Michaelis constant, Km, 
also shows a similar trend but with only a 2-fold increase from the minimal to maximal 
temperature with no significant increase at any given temperature as seen with Vm values. As with 
the first order rate constant, the second order rate constant, V/K, shows a similar rate of increase, 
with the values increasing 5-fold from minimal to maximal temperature. The kinetic parameters 
for each temperature are listed in Table 4-2. 
 
4.3. Studies on native and cross-linked aggregate of FAE-II 
Thermal stability on a freeze dried purified FAE-II enzyme and on a CLEAs in 25-85oC is 
reported in Table 4-3. FAE-II and CLEAs have optimum temperature at 55oC and optimum pH at 
5.5 (Table 4-3). The thermal stability profile of both native and CLEAs of feruloyl esterase 
clearly shows that both enzymes were stable at 55oC, showing a half life of 24 h. While at 65oC 
the enzyme in both forms retained almost 60% of the initial activity, after 3 h of incubation at 
85oC more than 80% of enzyme activity was lost.

observed between the effect of ionic detergents and non ionic one, even the ionic detergents 
should typically modify protein structure to a greater extent than the non ionic one. A zwitterionic 
detergent, CHAPS, caused a slight inhibition on esterase, which is more effective in protein-
protein interaction than non-ionic detergents and their extent of protein denaturation are less than 
those of ionic detergents. The degree of modification varies with the individual protein and the 
particular detergent. Neugebauer et al. (1990) proved that the non-ionic detergents stimulated the 
esterase enzyme and most of the non-ionic detergents are non-denaturing, but are less effective at 
disrupting protein aggregation. 
 
Data presented previously for the inhibition effect of EDTA indicate that enzyme activity 
did not drop to zero in the presence of EDTA (Dosanjh ad Kaur, 2002; Nawani et al., 1998). In 
our results, enzyme activity decreased by 45-50 % (Table 4-5). Enzyme activity was almost 
completely restored by adding any metal ion studied in this work as metal ions can form very 
strong and stable binary complexes (Holleman and Wiberg, 2001). However, we can not suggest 
that the enzyme requires metal ions for its activity.  
From Table 4-5, we observe that enzyme activities lost by nearly 50% and 25%, when 30-
70% (v/v) of glycerol and 1-propanol were used, respectively. Urea is an important solute found 
in the intra- and extracellular compartments of marine elasmobranchs (Perlman and Goldstein, 
1989) and in the mammalian kidney (Wolff and Balaban, 1990). The findings in this study show 
that after the addition of urea, 60-70% of the activity of the enzyme (native FAE-II and CLEAs) 
was lost (Table 4-5).  
In the present work, we found that after the addition of GdnHCl, the relative activities 
were about 70% (Table 4-5). The GdnHCl-induced denaturation of the holo proteins is generally 
found to be highly reversible, enabling quantitative analysis of the effects of the mutations on 
protein stability. Because H2O2 is widely regarded as a cytotoxic agent, levels must be minimized

25%, when 30-70% (v/v) of glycerol and 1-propanol were used, respectively. (6) After adding 
urea, 60-70% of the enzyme activity (native FAE-II and CLEA) was lost. (77) The effect of 
hydrogen peroxide on enzyme activity showed that enzyme activity was lost by 70-80%. (8) 
Ca++ is unique among metal ions in enhancing the FAE activity and also acts to depress the 
thermal inactivation and chemical denaturation.  
In the fourth part, it was found that the kinetics of GdnHCl denaturation of FAE-II 
suggests partially unfolding of the protein structure. Solubility of activated A. awamori FAE-
II could be altered by temperature and pH changes. Besides, it was also observed that an 
interaction between both temperature and pH on activated FAE-II enzyme solubility exists, 
but the interaction is rather limited near its isoelectric point (pI ~5.5). 
In the final part of this study, A. awamori FAE was successfully expressed in E. coli, 
purified and crystallized. It was found that the non-modular type A feruloyl esterase from A. 
awamori (AwfaeA) displays an α/β hydrolase fold with a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, similar 
to that found in fungi lipases and that reported for .type A feruloyl esterase from A. niger.

Abstract  
Faced with environment problem and exhaustion of fossil fuel, the idea of utilizing activated 
sludge  as  a  source  of  renewable  energy  has  attracted  many  researchers.  Methods  on  the  
use  of activated  sludge  as  an  energy  source,  such  as  fermentation,  pyrolysis  and  thermal-
gasification  for hydrogen  production  have  been  investigated.  However, due to the complicate 
nature of sludge, it is difficult to apply those methods for fuel production. Activated sludge has 
the potential to be used as a raw  material  for  producing  biodiesel  which  is  an  environmental  
friendly  fuel  and  an  alternative  for petro-diesel. Sub-critical water (SCW) treatment of sludge 
has been known as a cheap and effective method for reducing its organic compound, especially 
those carcinogenic aromatic PCBs or PAHs. In addition, extractable lipid amount in sludge also 
increases after SCW treatment.    
In this study, dry sludge was firstly subjected to subcritical water treatment. The supernatant 
(water  phase)  from  the  SCW  treatment  of  sludge  was  collected  and  centrifuged  for  
further  analysis whereas  the  remaining  solid  sludge  was  freeze  dried  and  subjected  to  
solvent  extraction.  Sludge oil obtained was then dewaxed, degummed to remove wax and 
phospholipids. Titration and saponification were  employed  to  separate  saponifiables  lipids  
from  the  unsaponifiables  in  the  dewaxed/degummed sludge  oil.  Composition  of  the  neutral  
lipids  as  well  as  its  fatty  acid  profile  were  determined  and compared to those obtained 
without SCW treatment.  
Keywords: biodiesel, sub-critical water, activated sludge, fatty acids, solvent extraction.

The conference was spectacularly held with more than 1,096 oral and poster technical 
presentations in 14 diverse research interest areas such as: analytical chemistry; inorganic 
chemistry; macromolecular chemistry; organic chemistry; physical chemistry; theoretical and 
computational chemistry; agrochemistry; biological chemistry; environmental chemistry; 
materials and nanotechnology; alternative energy technology; chemistry outreach to the 
community; health and technology; and, security. Almost all of the topics presented in the 
conference were very interesting. However, since some sessions that I was interested in took 
place at the same time so it was impossible to participate in all those sessions.  
I presented two works in this conference: Purification and identification of unknown 
hydrocarbons in soybean oil deodorizer distillate (in area Agrochemistry, session Application of 
Liquid and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry to Agrochemical Challenges) and A study of 
tocopherols and free phytosterols separation via low temperature liquid-liquid extraction method 
(in area Agrochemistry, session Value-Added Food Products from Fruits and Vegetables). Other 
sessions (oral and poster) that I attended were those in Agrochemistry, Environmental Chemistry 
and Alternate Energy Technology areas. The presenters were graduate students, researchers, 
industrial representatives and professors that came from a wide array of research interests. They 
come not only from USA, Europe, and Japan, but also from Canada, China, Costa Rica, Fiji, 
India, Malaysia, Taiwan, Nation of Brunei, Singapore and Thailand. The topics covered in my 
section are quite interesting and helpful to my research. I had great time in discussion about some 
  
Abstract:  
Soybean oil deodorizer distillate (SODD) is a byproduct of the refining process in obtaining 
refined soybean oil. In the isolation of squalene from SODD, ca. 30% of non polar lipid fraction 
(NPLF) is hydrocarbons (HCs), which can be divided into three main groups, viz. aliphatic, 
steroidal, and terpene HC. Aliphatic HCs of vegetable oil actually has potential in substituting the 
role of petroleum-based products and can be used as fingerprint for a given seed because they are 
indigenous to plant. The steroidal HC content of vegetable oil can be used as a means of 
identifying the oil and therefore, for detecting adulteration. The objective is to isolate and identify 
unknown aliphatic and steroidal HCs found in SODD. 
The purification of each unknown can be achieved in three steps. Firstly, NPLF was 
obtained from SODD by a modified soxhlet extraction, then the  NPLF was subjected to modified 
column chromatography to collect all hydrocarbons fraction and finally unknown aliphatic HCs 
were purified by conventional silica gel column chromatography (ca. 97% purity), while 
unknown steroidal HCs purified via vacuum distillation (ca. 90% purity) from the collected 
hydrocarbon fraction. Identification of individual aliphatic and steroidal HC was accomplished 
via IR, TLC, GC and GC-MS analyses.  
In this study, GC chromatogram of aliphatic HC showed an unresolvable complex mixture 
of aliphatic HC containing only three major peaks and numbers of minor peaks. TLC method 
showed one spot of pure aliphatic compounds group. So, later IR analysis was further carried out 
to elucidate the unknown aliphatic HCs structure and it was found that no unsaturated bonds 
detected. Meanwhile, GC chromatogram of steroidal HC showed 5 major peaks. They were 
identified as derivatives of 　-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol. Special attention was 
needed in order to identify isomers which differ only in the position of double bonds.

Introduction 
 Commercial biodiesel (BD) production uses vegetable oil as raw material. This not only 
makes the cost of BD unable to compete with diesel but also create a fuel versus food issue. So it 
is important to search for a non-food, cheap and abundant raw material for producing BD.  
 The use of non edible crops, waste animal fat or used frying oil, microalgae and microbial 
biomass could helped relieve the increasing demand of  vegetable-oil derived-raw material as 
well as lower cost of BD. However excessive acreage requirement for planting crops or 
generating microbial oils could also displace lands needs to grow crops (Revellame et al., 2010).  
 Activated sludge (AS) has received considerable attention recently as a potential source 
for producing BD. The utilization of AS as raw material not only may help decreasing BD price 
but also contribute in solving the problem of sludge management.  
  Dufreche et al. (2007) investigated BD production from AS by in situ methanolysis or 
indirectly by firstly extracting lipid followed by reacting with methanol. In situ methanolysis of 
dried sludge gave highest BD yield (6.23%). Mondala et al. (2009) investigated production of BD 
from AS. A maximum BD yield of 2.5 % was obtained at 75oC, 5% (v/v) sulfuric acid and 12:1 
methanol to sludge mass ratio.  
 The idea of directly convert wet AS to BD was proposed by Revellame et al. (2011) 
However, their results show that the cost of in situ reaction of wet sludge is higher than when 
dried sludge was used due to higher amounts of methanol and catalyst required.  
 Although there has been progress in using AS for BD production, it is still far from being 
competitive with diesel. Besides moderate BD yield attained, low extractable lipid, high water 
content in sludge, as well as the complication in composition of lipid extracted are also factors 
that impeded the commercialization of BD production from AS.  
 By using subcritical water (SCW) pretreatment, Huynh et al. (2010) succeeded in 
increasing the amount of neutral lipid extracted from AS by almost four times. If SCW is capable 
of catalyzing the in-situ reaction of AS and methanol, problems in production of BD from AS 
such as high water content in sludge, the need of acid/base catalyst and low lipid content can be 
relieved or even eliminated. The objective of this study was to investigate the possibility of using 
SCW for in situ reaction of AS with methanol.  
2.  Materials and Methods 
2.1 Materials 
AS was collected from Uni-President Enterprises Corp. Ltd. (Taoyuan, Taiwan). Standard 
of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) mixture was obtained from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). 
 Dufreche et al. (2007) reported that in-situ transesterification of AS gave highest yield of 
BD among all methods tested due to that the reagents have access to all oil in sludge instead of 
just what was extracted; however the reduction of water content in AS (98 wt. %) to an 
acceptable limits (5 wt. %) required in the in-situ process could add up to 55% of the BD cost. 
Huge amount of energy required for drying AS attributes to the increase of processing cost and 
hence BD price. According to Revellame et al. (2011), for substrate with high moisture content 
such as sludge, increasing methanol loading might be more economical than reducing the water 
to a very low level so high reaction conversion can be obtained. However the authors failed to 
meet the target of achieving a reasonable BD price due to high methanol loading (30 mL/g dry 
sludge) and catalyst (10% of total volume) required.  
Water at atmospheric condition has adverse effect on esterification since it is a reaction 
product. However, under subcritical condition water may be helpful since it is an efficient acid-
base catalyst owing to a high dissociation constant. SCW was used as a efficient reagent to 
enhance the extractable lipid content from AS (Huynh et al., 2010). Levine et al. (2010) also 
succeed in using SCW to hydrolyze intracellular lipids, conglomerate cell into an easily filterable 
solid that retains the lipids for the production of BD from wet microalgae. In this study, water in 
wet AS was employed as catalyst to allow direct conversion of AS into BD by conducting 
reaction under SCW and methanol (SCW-SCM) condition.   
Wet AS (water content 85 wt. %) was subjected to in-situ transesterification under SCW-
SCM condition. The  use of methanol to sludge ratio of 30 (mL/g) was based on the study of 
Revellame et al. (2011). Results obtained were compared with the maximum BD yield obtained 
by the conventional acid-catalyzed in situ transesterification of dried AS. Significant BD yield (g 
FAME/g AS) can be achieved in a reasonable reaction time by using the proposed method as 
shown in Table 1. The highest FAME yield (45.6 wt. % based on dry AS or 7.6 wt. % based on 
wet AS) was obtained after 24 h. For a reaction time of 8 h or longer, the FAMEs content in the 
product can reach more than 80%. Although there are still certain amounts of free fatty acids 
(FFAs) after 8 h reaction, FAME yield achieved after 8 h reaction (44.56 wt. %) is not much 
different from that of 24h (45.58 wt. %). Figure 2 shows the GC chromatograms of the products 
of SCW-SCM in situ conversion of wet AS into BD as well as the chromatogram of the product 
of H2SO4-catalyzed conversion of dried AS into BD. The most noticeable difference between the 
results of the proposed method and the conventional H2SO4 catalyzed methods is the presence of 
FFAs in the product of SCW-SCM in- situ reaction. This is because methanolysis of neutral lipids 
and hydrolysis of esters occur simultaneously in the presence of SCW; however the use of excess 
methanol favors the formation of FAMEs.  The results of this study agrees with that of Mondala 
et al. (2009)  on the kinetics of in situ transesterification of AS. They reported that reaction 
completion was achieved after 24 h;  reaction rate decreased and reached equilibrium at reaction 
time more than 8 h. BD yield obtained in this study (45.6 wt. %) is much higher than that of 
3.93% reported by Revellame et al. (2011) and 4.79% reported by Revellame et al. (2010) This 
may be the results of differences in sources of sludge as well as the methods used. The AS 
employed in this study was obtained from a food processing factory with waste water which is

2.  與會心得 
The Conference was spectacular with its well-organisation and the great 
number of 650 technical presentations in 12 interest areas such as: Agricultural 
Microscopy, Analytical, Biotechnology, Edible Applications Technology, Food 
Structure and Functionality Forum, Health and Nutrition, Industrial Oils Products, 
Lipid oxidation and Quality, Phospholipids, Processing, Protein and Co-Products, 
Surfactants and Detergents,. Besides oral presentation, there were also more than 100 
poster presentations. Almost all of the topics presented in the Conference are very 
interesting. However, since some presentation sections took place at the same time so 
it was impossible to participate in all sessions. In addition to the session (General 
Industrial Oil Products) that I had my oral, I also attended in sessions such as General 
Analytical, Biotechnology and others. I also took a general view on poster exhibition. 
Most speakers are professors or students from USA, Canada, European or Japan. The 
topics covered in my section are quite interesting, especially some are very helpful 
and related to my research and there were quite a lot of participants. We had great 
time in discussion about our research. 
The Technician Sections Program, The Conference with more than 100 
Cooperated Organizations and Members have provided me a great chance to enrich 
and update my knowledge on my research and other related topic. Furthermore, 
Student Group Interest and Mentor program were also held by AOCS which has 
provided me a chance to make friend from all over the world and I especially 
for petro-diesel. Sub-critical water (SCW) treatment of sludge has been known as a 
cheap and effective method for reducing its organic compound, especially those 
carcinogenic aromatic PCBs or PAHs. In addition, extractable lipid amount in sludge 
also increases after SCW treatment.    
In this study, dry sludge was firstly subjected to subcritical water treatment. The 
supernatant (water  phase)  from  the  SCW  treatment  of  sludge  was  
collected  and  centrifuged  for  further  analysis whereas  the  remaining  
solid  sludge  was  freeze  dried  and  subjected  to  solvent  extraction.  
Sludge oil obtained was then dewaxed, degummed to remove wax and phospholipids. 
Titration and saponification were  employed  to  separate  saponifiables  lipids  
from  the  unsaponifiables  in  the  dewaxed/degummed sludge  oil.  
Composition  of  the  neutral  lipids  as  well  as  its  fatty  acid  profile  
were  determined  and compared to those obtained without SCW treatment.  
Keywords: biodiesel, sub-critical water, activated sludge, fatty acids, solvent 
extraction. 
Program Features: 
More than 45 organizations officially participated. 
A three-day exposition with displays by more than 50 organizations was held. 
Three workshop sessions were given to discuss about the state-of-art of three 
currently hot topics (Microfluidics & Nanofluidics (Dec 16); Lignin Biorefinery (Dec 
17); Defense Threat Reduction Agency – Chemical/Biological Technologies (Dec 18)) 
Approximately 250 student finalist were selected from over 2500 poster submission to

Abstract:  
Soybean oil deodorizer distillate (SODD) is a byproduct of the refining process 
in obtaining refined soybean oil. In the isolation of squalene from SODD, ca. 30% of 
non polar lipid fraction (NPLF) is hydrocarbons (HCs), which can be divided into 
three main groups, viz. aliphatic, steroidal, and terpene HC. Aliphatic HCs of 
vegetable oil actually has potential in substituting the role of petroleum-based 
products and can be used as fingerprint for a given seed because they are indigenous 
to plant. The steroidal HC content of vegetable oil can be used as a means of 
identifying the oil and therefore, for detecting adulteration. The objective is to isolate 
and identify unknown aliphatic and steroidal HCs found in SODD. 
The purification of each unknown can be achieved in three steps. Firstly, NPLF 
was obtained from SODD by a modified soxhlet extraction, then the  NPLF was 
subjected to modified column chromatography to collect all hydrocarbons fraction 
and finally unknown aliphatic HCs were purified by conventional silica gel column 
chromatography (ca. 97% purity), while unknown steroidal HCs purified via vacuum 
distillation (ca. 90% purity) from the collected hydrocarbon fraction. Identification of 
individual aliphatic and steroidal HC was accomplished via IR, TLC, GC and GC-MS 
analyses.  
In this study, GC chromatogram of aliphatic HC showed an unresolvable 
complex mixture of aliphatic HC containing only three major peaks and numbers of

Abstract  
 
A novel method for directly converting wet activated sludge into biodiesel 
was proposed in this study. Water was employed both as hydrolysis reagent 
to enhance the extraction of lipid in activated sludge, and as catalyst for 
the conversion of neutral lipids into biodiesel under subcritical condition. 
The method is capable of achieving ca. 90% conversion of FAMEs within 
reasonable time without the need of traditional acid/base catalyst. Since 
water is employed as a catalyst, removing of water is no longer required, 
therefore, significantly reduces the processing cost for producing biodiesel 
from activated sludge.  
increasing the amount of neutral lipid extracted from AS by almost four times. If 
SCW is capable of catalyzing the in-situ reaction of AS and methanol, problems in 
production of BD from AS such as high water content in sludge, the need of acid/base 
catalyst and low lipid content can be relieved or even eliminated. The objective of this 
study was to investigate the possibility of using SCW for in situ reaction of AS with 
methanol.  
2.  Materials and Methods 
2.1 Materials 
AS was collected from Uni-President Enterprises Corp. Ltd. (Taoyuan, 
Taiwan). Standard of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) mixture was obtained from 
Supelco (Bellefonte, PA, USA). All solvents and reagents were either HPLC or 
analytical reagent grade. 
2.2. Reaction of Wet AS with Methanol under Subcritical Condition  
Dried AS (1 g) was dissolved in deionised water (5 mL) and methanol (30 mL) 
in a reactor. Nitrogen was employed for keeping the mixture in liquid state. Figure 1 
is the schematic diagram of the reaction system. 
After reaction, vapour in the reactor was released, collected and condensed. 
The liquid was extracted by hexane twice and all upper organic phases were combined. 
Hexane was added to the residue sludge and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. The 
mixture was then filtered, washed with hexane. All supernatants were combined, dried 
over magnesium sulphate. Mass of the product was measured after hexane was 
removed. FAME conversion was determined by high temperature gas chromatography 
analysis of the product. 
2.3. Gas Chromatography Analysis 
Analyses of un-reacted neutral lipids in the product was performed on a 
Shimadzu GC 17A (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a split-split injector and a flame 
ionization detector (FID). Separation was carried out on a DB-5HT (5% 
phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane nonpolar column (15 m×0.32 mm i.d., 0.1 µm film 
thickness) (Agilent technologies, Palo Alto, California). Both injector and detector 
temperatures were 370°C. The column temperature was set at 80°C, increase to 365°C 
at 15°C/min and hold for 8 min. Total analysis time was 29 min. N2 was the carrier 
gas with a linear velocity of 30 cm/sec at 80°C.  
lipids, conglomerate cell into an easily filterable solid that retains the lipids for the 
production of BD from wet microalgae. In this study, water in wet AS was employed 
as catalyst to allow direct conversion of AS into BD by conducting reaction under 
SCW and methanol (SCW-SCM) condition.   
Wet AS (water content 85 wt. %) was subjected to in-situ transesterification 
under SCW-SCM condition. The  use of methanol to sludge ratio of 30 (mL/g) was 
based on the study of Revellame et al. (2011). Results obtained were compared with 
the maximum BD yield obtained by the conventional acid-catalyzed in situ 
transesterification of dried AS. Significant BD yield (g FAME/g AS) can be achieved 
in a reasonable reaction time by using the proposed method as shown in Table 1. The 
highest FAME yield (45.6 wt. % based on dry AS or 7.6 wt. % based on wet AS) was 
obtained after 24 h. For a reaction time of 8 h or longer, the FAMEs content in the 
product can reach more than 80%. Although there are still certain amounts of free 
fatty acids (FFAs) after 8 h reaction, FAME yield achieved after 8 h reaction (44.56 
wt. %) is not much different from that of 24h (45.58 wt. %). Figure 2 shows the GC 
chromatograms of the products of SCW-SCM in situ conversion of wet AS into BD as 
well as the chromatogram of the product of H2SO4-catalyzed conversion of dried AS 
into BD. The most noticeable difference between the results of the proposed method 
and the conventional H2SO4 catalyzed methods is the presence of FFAs in the product 
of SCW-SCM in- situ reaction. This is because methanolysis of neutral lipids and 
hydrolysis of esters occur simultaneously in the presence of SCW; however the use of 
excess methanol favors the formation of FAMEs.  The results of this study agrees 
with that of Mondala et al. (2009)  on the kinetics of in situ transesterification of AS. 
They reported that reaction completion was achieved after 24 h;  reaction rate 
decreased and reached equilibrium at reaction time more than 8 h. BD yield obtained 
in this study (45.6 wt. %) is much higher than that of 3.93% reported by Revellame et 
al. (2011) and 4.79% reported by Revellame et al. (2010) This may be the results of 
differences in sources of sludge as well as the methods used. The AS employed in this 
study was obtained from a food processing factory with waste water which is believed 
to favor the growth and accumulation of lipid in microorganisms. In this study, SCW 
was employed as the catalyst as well as the hydrolysis reagent to enhance the amount 
of extractable lipid in AS. By using the method proposed in this work, the presence of 
water in the reaction mixture turns out to be an advantage.   
 
Although BD yield obtained by SCW-SCM in-situ reaction cannot reach the 
maximum yield (58.9 wt. %) achieved by the acid (H2SO4) catalyzed reaction, the 
method proposed in this work possesses advantages over traditional method such as: 
(i) Wet sludge (contains 85% water) can be directly used so drying is not required,
