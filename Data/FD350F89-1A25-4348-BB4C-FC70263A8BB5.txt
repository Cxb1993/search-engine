processes. In this study, As and P implants were 
annealed by microwave methods. Sheet resistance 
values continued to drop for anneal times after the 
regrowth process was complete. 
In the third year, we first use low temperature and 
short time to activate amorphous silicon, and it can 
fabricate on the second layer in the fucture. Using 
microwave annealing (MWA), the dopant in the α-Si 
may be well-activated and the annealing time reduced 
to 30 minutes. This is faster than conventional 
furnace solid phase crystallization (SPC). The 
temperature can be controlled at 480~530oC by low 
temperature microwave annealing than that by RTA. New 
microwave annealing may expand the range of a-Si 
applications and diffusionless dopant distribution to 
use as glass or plastic substrate. In addition, we 
successfully activated the source/drain region, 
enhanced the carrier mobility and suppressed the 
short-channel effects by using low temperature 
microwave annealing. This technique is promising for 
applications of realizing high utility rate to low-
cost nano-scaled transistors.

中文摘要 
我們首先應用低溫微波(Low Temperature Microwave)系統完成薄膜電晶體的製作。第
一年，我們應用新的微波活化技巧製作通道長度為65奈米的CMOS薄膜電晶體。我們成功
地不用擴散來活化多晶矽的閘極、源極和汲極接點之外，還有BF2的pmos、P31的nmos也宣
告成功。這項新的技術對於高效能低成本的3D奈米電晶體製程將會被視為是極有前途的。
第二年，微波退火所需的溫度遠低於傳統退火傳統熱退火所需的溫度。在微波退火下，觀
察分別以不同劑量與能量的砷(As)與磷(P)的活化程度與活化後摻雜分布的狀況。同時，因
離子佈值而轉變為非晶矽層再磊晶成長後，片電阻仍隨著退火時間增加而下降。 
第三年，我們首先利用低溫並快速的方式進行非晶矽的活化，未來要置於上層的結構。
透過微波退火技術，非晶矽中的摻雜離子可以有效的被活化，並能將整個製程時間縮短至
30分鐘。因此相較於傳統爐管的固相再結晶技術(SPC)而言具有較為快速的製程時間。同
時，相對於快速退火製程技術(RTA)，低溫微波退火技術可以將整個製程的溫度控制在
490~540oC之間。此新穎的低溫微波退火技術，可以增加非晶矽薄膜的應用範圍至玻璃或塑
膠基板，並降低擴散。此外，利用低溫微波退火技術，我們成功地將元件的源極/汲極區域
活化，並提升載子漂移速率以及有效的抑制短通道效應。因此，低溫微波退火技術被期望
能提供奈米元件製程高產率以及低成本的技術。

前言 
疊層結構 (Stacking structure) 
    目前因為我們的生活越來越便利，所以需用電腦或機械控制的東西也越來越多，因此
電腦的計算速度也需增加，而能在有效的面積裡增加 CMOS 的總數，則是縮小元件的尺寸，
可是當尺寸到一定的程度時，勢必會受到限制，會有一些外在的製程因素和內部的物理特
性限制它。所以有人則是想往垂直的方向去增加元件數，打破以往只能以 2D 思考的迷思，
他們開發了 3D 的技術。 
    首先，在 1980年初期時，以成功的製作出雙疊層結構的雛形(圖一)[1]。往後也陸陸續
續有人進行這方面的研究，但是結構和層數並沒有很大的突破[2-5]。但是 2006年，已有人
完成三層結構，他們先製做出一層基本的元件結構，他們利用磊晶與蝕刻的技術多方的交
換使用，完成三層元件的製做(圖二)[6]。他們以此技術研發，在相同的矽基板面積中和相
同的元件尺寸(約 0.18nm)下，將近完成一般製程元件總數的三倍量，因此可以使原本的運
算速度提高三倍左右。 
    但是在製程上有一定的技術需要突破。首先，他們之所以要利用蝕刻的技術，是因為
往後的製程結構中不能破壞到先前已完成的元件，但是往往在成長多晶矽時，我們需要利
用爐管以長時間高溫的退火製程完成，可是後段的一些高溫會導致金屬的擴散，使汲極和
源極區的金屬穿透入矽基板中，影響元件特性，所以低溫的製程方式在疊層結構的應用上，
扮演極重要的角色。因此，本計劃希望引進微波退火技術，我們可以利用微波進行低溫多
晶矽基板的退火，也因為低溫的關係，不會使金屬擴散至多晶矽中。另一方面，第二層之
後的元件之源汲極摻雜的活化也是另一個重點，當我們進行第二層以上的元件摻雜活化
時，同時也要顧及下方元件的結構完整。所以勢必也要利用到低溫的活化技術，若是使用
一般的高溫退火技術，並無法做到基板活化均勻，原因是當結構越來越多層時，基板的導
熱效果不一定均勻，所以只利用溫度進行活化的方式並不均勻，因此效果有限。另外，高
溫的退火活化方式亦會破壞下層元件的結構。 
 在疊層結構上的元件，實際上是跟薄膜電晶體相類似，只不過當我們要把薄膜電晶體

研究目的 
在過去的幾十年間，金氧半電晶體(MOSFETs)的特徵尺寸不斷地往下縮小。從早期的
MOSFETs製程中，通道長度大約在幾個微米（micrometer）的等級。但是今日的MOSFETs
製程中，這個參數已經縮小了幾十倍甚至超過數百倍。到了2006年初時，國際知名的半導
體大廠Intel已經開始以65奈米的技術來製造新一代的微處理器。然而，實際的元件通道長
度可能比這個數字還小一些，MOSFETs特徵尺寸不斷縮小，可以讓積體電路的效能大大的
提升。從歷史的角度來看，這些技術上的突破和半導體製程的進步有著密不可分的關係，
但是隨著尺度的縮小，在相關的製程方面卻發生了很大的問題，也讓人們發覺似乎摩爾定
律可能破局或該修改。然而Intel確誓言隨著尺寸縮小，縱使至45奈米之後的摩爾定律依然
延續不變。Intel的LSI技術策略研究員暨技術策略總監Paolo A. Gargini表示，即使在45nm以
後，也將延續每兩年電晶體數量倍增的晶圓製程技術。繼2007年下半年量產的45nm之後，
Intel將於2009年將開始32nm製程、2011年將開始22nm製程的量產。此外，透過導入多閘極
(multi gate)構造及新溝道材料技術的改進，摩爾定律將延續至往後的10～15年。但是在元件
尺度微縮化時，我們會在更進階的製程中面臨一更多瓶頸，所以我們不但想將元件尺度微
縮化外，想往垂直的方向去增加元件數，打破以往只能以2D思考的迷思，開發3D的技術。
因此本計劃將利用低溫微波來進行奈米薄膜電晶體的活化退火處理。因為低溫的製程，將
可以穩定的製作第二層以上的元件，而不破壞下層的結構。另外，薄膜電晶體的可靠度分
析與低溫退火製程的相關因素之比較亦是本計畫的另外一個重點。 
研究方法

相對於其他的退火方式有更小的轉相時間。表面的平整度對元件的製程有很大的影響，而
圖六利用原子力表面影像(AFM)來分析三種退火方式的影響，從圖中發現，所有的退火方
式所引致的表面平整性及粗糙性皆大致相同。 
a. 微波次數的電性分析 
    圖七展示了穿隧是顯微鏡(TEM)下的非晶矽結構截面圖，圖中顯示閘極長度為
150nm，圖八指出了在微波退火不同週期 5P 600s 之條件中，W/L = 10μm/150nm的 nMOS 
TFTs 之特性。微波 5P 三次個周期及兩個周期相對於微波一個周期，在 Ion 的部分分別能
增強 21.4X 和 2.24X 倍，但在 Ioff的部分卻沒有差別，因此，微波退火 5P 600s 三個周期在
Ion/Ioff 的比值上可以有 106 的提升，同時，片電阻值(Rs)也可有效的降低藉由微波的周期
數，圖九中，更可證明離子增強的結果。圖十中，對 W/L = 10μm/150nm 的元件，5P 600s
微波退火三個周期及兩個周期分別對電導有 6X 及 1.6X 的提升。XRD 圖中可以發現晶包大
小隨微波周期數而提升，一週期，兩周期及三周期的晶胞大小分別是 413Å，450Å 和 585Å。 
    我們認為微波的次數周期和元件的特性直接成正比，此外，微波退火除了能增加
電流及電導值外，同時還能增加晶胞的大小，因此，藉由低溫波退火，非晶矽薄膜電晶體
特性可以有效的提升。 
b. 微波與快速退火的電性分析 
7 
 
臨界電壓經計算後大約分別是-16V 及-19.61V。在 p-MOS 中，利用三個周期的微波退火 5P 
600s 最能有效地降低 DIBL 效應，我們認為硼原子比較難活化，所以未來需要更高能量的
微波得到更佳的結果。圖十五中，經微波退火後的片電阻值大致相同，而快速熱退火卻有
較高的阻值，因此 MWA 相對於 RTA 更能有效提高 Ion，雖然 MWA 3P 對於 MWA 5P 有幾
乎相近的活化結果且溫度較低(490oC)，但 5P 的活化的均勻性上依然比 3P 的好很多。圖十
三，W/L = 10μm/210nm的元件中，RTA 900oC 30s 相對於 MWA 3P 及 MWA 5P 在電導(Gm)
上分別有 3.56X 及 3.89X 的提升，從 XRD 中亦發現 W/L = 10μm/210nm的元件裡，MWA 5p 
(585Å)的晶胞大小是 MWA 3P (510Å)和 RTA (310Å).，三者中最大的。

materials. Recently, TiN has been investigated as a potential
gate-electrode material because of the work function near the
midgap in Si, and it is frequently used as a diffusion barrier.
In this letter, we demonstrate p-type metal–oxide–
semiconductor thin-film transistors (p-MOS TFTs) with a
TiN gate electrode in which the short-channel effects were
suppressed.
II. EXPERIMENTS
A 6-in (100) bulk silicon wafer was used as the starting
material. After a 1-μm-thick silicon dioxide (SiO ) layer was
thermally grown as a buried oxide, a 50-nm-thick undoped
amorphous Si film was deposited using low-pressure chemical
vapor deposition (LPCVD), followed by solid-phase crystal-
lization for recrystallization to improve the channel mobility.
The active region was defined by electron-beam lithography.
Then, a 45-nm-thick tetraethoxysilane oxide layer was de-
posited by LPCVD as a gate dielectric, and a 150-nm-thick
TiN layer was deposited by PVD. After the gate was patterned
by anisotropic etching, the source (S) and drain (D) were im-
planted with BF (15 keV at 5 10 cm ) for p-MOS TFTs
followed by different dopant-activation conditions. The MW
heating was performed in an AXOM-300 highly multimoded
chamber, manufactured by DSG Technologies, Inc.[11].
Fig. 1(a) shows a comparison of the temperature profiles of
different dopant-activation methods. Annealing was carried out
using a 5.8-GHz MW for 600 s, and the maximum temperature
was 500 C. A N purge was performed before the MW was
started, and the N flow was maintained until the process was
completed. The MW annealing process time was defined as
the duration for which the MW was turned on. In addition,
the splits of RTA at 900 C for 15 s and 500 C for 600 s
were used as the control splits, and they were in the N flow
environment during all annealing processes. The temperature
profiles were measured from the wafer backside by an infrared
detector during the RTA and MW anneal. Fig. 1(b) shows the
top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, and the
LG/W is 0.12 μm/0.6 μm, where the gate oxide thickness
is 45 nm and the channel thickness is 45 nm. The electrical
characterizations were carried out using a Keithley 4200 system
at room temperature.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Fig. 2 shows the transfer characteristics of p-MOS TFTs with
different gate lengths annealed by (a) RTA at 900 C for 15 s,
(b) RTA at 500 C for 600 s, and (c) MW for 600 s. From
Fig. 2(a), the I /I ratio is approximately 10 (I at VG =
12 V and I at VG = 2 V) with LG = 0.45 μm. In addition,
as the gate length is less than 0.45 μm, the off-current increases
and the S/D punchthrough behavior, for which the I /I
ratio is approximately 10 with LG = 0.25 μm, is observed.
Therefore, with a 45-nm-thick gate oxide, it is difficult to
fabricate nanometer-scale TFTs by the high-temperature RTA
process. In the case of annealing by RTA at 500 C for 600 s, as
shown in Fig. 2(b), under the same annealing temperature and
time as that for MW annealing, the magnitudes of all the on-
currents are limited to approximately 10 A regardless of the
transistor dimensions. The I /I ratio is approximately 10
as LG varies from 0.45 to 0.12 μm, indicating that the efficiency
of boron activation in the S/D region by RTA at 500 C for 600 s
is too low to drive the D current.
However, it is interesting to note that the minimum gate
lengths, as shown in Fig. 2(c), yielded by MW annealing for
600 s are 0.12 μm with W = 0.6 μm. The punchthrough effect
is suppressed due to the low-temperature annealing process. In
addition, the I /I ratios are approximately 10 (I at VG =
12 V and I at VG = 2 V) for the p-MOS TFT fabricated
using MW annealing for 600 s with W/L = 0.6 μm/120 nm. It
appears that the low-temperature MW annealing process could
suppress the short-channel effects. Furthermore, as compared
with MW annealing using conventional RTA, the efficiency
of boron activation in the S/D region is high in the case of
nanoscale p-MOS TFT fabrication.
Fig. 3 shows the resistivity of a poly-Si film in the S/D
region under different annealing conditions. In the case of
annealing by RTA at 500 C for 600 s under the same annealing
temperature as that for MW annealing, the resistivity is the
highest among all splits, indicating that the dopant could not
be activated effectively.
The large resistivity of the S/D region after annealing by RTA
at 500 C for 600 s demonstrated the limit of the magnitude
of the on-current, as shown in Fig. 2(b). In addition, under
MW annealing for 600 s, the resistivity could be suppressed by
around four orders, indicating that the dopant could be activated

Amorphous-Layer Regrowth and Activation of P and
As Implanted Si by Low-Temperature
Microwave Annealing

Abstract—Microwave annealing of dopants in Si has been re-
ported to produce highly activated junctions at temperatures far
below those needed for comparable results using conventional
thermal processes. However, the details of the kinetics and mech-
anisms for microwave annealing are far from well understood.
In this paper, 20-keV arsenic (As) and 15-keV phosphorus (P)
implants, in a dose range from 1 to 5 × 1015 ion/cm2, were
annealed by microwave methods at temperatures below 500 ◦C.
These junctions were characterized by profile studies with sec-
ondary ion mass spectrometry and spreading resistance profiling,
sheet resistance with four-point probe, and extensive use of cross-
sectional transmission electron microscopy to follow the regrowth
of the as-implanted amorphous layers created by the implantation.
The amorphous-layer regrowth was observed to be uneven in
time, with relatively little amorphous/crystalline interface motion
for less than 50 s, followed by rapid regrowth for longer times.
Sheet resistance values continued to drop for anneal times after
the regrowth process was complete, with some evidence of dopant
deactivation for anneal times of 600 s.

I. INTRODUCTION
IN SCALING down the physical gate length of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors to 17 nm by 2015
to meet the International Technology Roadmap for Semi-
conductors 2009 (ITRS 2009) [1], several challenges must be
overcome. One of the main challenges in fabricating a front-
end process for high-performance devices is accurate control
of the placement of the active doping regions, with junction

depths targeted for less than 7.3 nm for the reduction of
short-channel effects. However, shallow junction depths would
increase higher junction resistance, resulting in increased power
dissipation and lower circuits drive currents and speeds [2]. To
keep the junction and contact resistances low, high-temperature
anneals have been extensively studied to electrically activate
implanted dopants and repair lattice damage created during ion
implantation to reduce junction leakage currents. These high-
temperature anneals include msec flash and laser pulses above
1200 ◦C [3], “spike” anneals for about 1 s at 1050 ◦C [4], solid-
phase epitaxy anneals at about 700 ◦C, and combinations of
spike + msec annealing or msec + spike anneal [5]. Although
all of these methods have demonstrated some successful appli-
cation to the source/drain anneal, they all entail a number of
problems that make processing more complicated. This is be-
cause the source/drain extension in the devices simultaneously
requires shrinking junction depths and improved abruptness to
increase device performance with a high transistor drive current
and a short delay time [6]. In addition, msec annealing methods
can create uneven heating of circuit elements due to emissivity
differences in near-surface device materials and limited phonon
diffusion distances for msec and shorter anneals [7].
Microwave heating of silicon allows for more even volumet-
ric heating of the wafer due to the greater penetration depth as-
sociated with microwave processing [8]. In addition, microwave
annealing presents an appealing potential solution, because it
takes place at a low temperature that restrains diffusion yet still
results in good dopant activation. Arsenic and boron activation
in a Si substrate by low-temperature microwave heating from
450 ◦C to 650 ◦C has been demonstrated, with dopant diffusion
effectively suppressed [9]. In addition, a strained 3-nm Ge
epilayer on a boron-implanted Si substrate was also preserved
using low-temperature microwave anneal [10].
However, the details of the kinetics and mechanisms for
microwave annealing are far from well understood. In this
paper, characteristics of activation and de-activation of P and
As implants through solid-phase epitaxily growth (SPEG) by
a low-temperature (< 500 ◦C) microwave annealing process
was studied. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) pictures were performed to evaluate the rates of SPEG
during the microwave annealing process on highly damaged
layers of P and As ion-implanted silicon samples. Rs of
P and As junctions formed with different ion doses and
annealed for different microwave annealing times were also
measured and compared. Secondary ion mass spectrometry

of Fig. 2(c)–(e), were 0.1 nm/s < 50 s, 0.8 nm/s between 50
and 75 s, and 0.32 nm/s between 75 and 100 s, i.e., an average
rate of 0.33 nm/s for the first 100 s. This is more than 102 times
faster than the regrowth for undoped Si(100) at 500 ◦C [12].
The a/c interface was still smooth for < 50-s microwave
annealing process, which indicated that microwave annealing
could nucleate and initialize SPEG at the a/c interface but
with relatively little a/c interface motion, due to the lower
wafer temperature during the early stages of the anneal process
(see Fig. 1). Between 50 and 75 s, the SPEG rate increased
from 0.1 to 0.8 nm/s, and Rs also improved from 650 to
160 Ω/sq. That is, most of the dopants could be activated during
this period effectively.
Between 75 and 100 s, the rate of the SPEG of P-implanted
samples was retarded and decreased from 0.8 to 0.32 nm/s.
For longer annealing times, from 100 s to 300 or 600 s, the
remaining amorphous Si layer could regain its crystallinity due
to the longer dwell times and higher process temperature.
Next, to keep the process temperature under low (< 430 ◦C)
temperature for a longer anneal time, six microwave annealing
cycles of 100 s each, totaling to 600 s, were also carried out.
Cross-sectional TEM images [see Fig. 2(f)] show excellent
crystallinity. Therefore, from the results of Fig. 2, the crys-
tallinity of the implanted Si layer depended on the microwave
annealing time if one would like to limit the maximum temper-
ature to below 430 ◦C.
Fig. 3(b) depicts the cross-sectional TEM images of the As-
implanted samples (20 keV and 5 × 1015 ion/cm2) after mi-
crowave annealing for 600 s. The cross-sectional TEM picture
also depicted excellent crystallinity of the annealed Si layer.
From the cross-sectional TEM images in Fig. 3(c)–(e), there
were still 39-, 26-, and 26-nm-thick amorphous Si layers after
the microwave annealing process for 50, 75, and 100 s, respec-

tively. The rate of SPEG was 0.04 nm/s < 50 s and 0.52 nm/s
between 50 and 75 s, with almost no SPEG between 75 and
100 s, i.e., an average rate of 0.15 nm/s for the first 100 s. In
contrast to those of the P-implanted samples, the cross-sectional
TEM images for the As-implanted samples [see Fig. 3(f)]
showed that the amorphized Si layer was not fully recrystallized
even by microwave annealing for 6 × 100 s, although the 600-s
anneal, with a higher peak temperature 480 ◦C, did recrystalize
the As-implant damage layer [see Fig. 3(b)].
In addition, the roughness of the regrowing a/c interfaces
increased markedly, to a max-min thickness range of 4 nm
[Fig. 3(f)], as one increased the number of 100-s microwave
annealing cycles, with a peak temperature 430 ◦C. This break-
down of planar front regrowth behavior for longer anneal times
at 430 ◦C is another indication that the regrowth kinetics for
high-dose As annealing with microwaves is more difficult than
lower doses and lighter ions, such as P.
Figs. 4 and 5 show the cross-sectional TEM images of
P- and As-implanted samples at a dose of 1 × 1015 ion/cm2.
In Figs. 4(a) and 5(a), the thickness of the amorphous Si layers
for As-implanted 15-keV P and 20-keV As was 35.9 and 34 nm,
respectively. From the cross-sectional TEM image of Fig. 4(b),
there was a residual 29.5-nm amorphous Si layer for the
P-implanted samples after microwave annealing for 50 s, which
was completely regrown for anneal times of 75 s. The rate of
SPEG was 0.13 nm/s < 50 s and 1.18 nm/s between 50 and
75 s. From the cross-sectional TEM picture of Fig. 5(b) and
(c), there were still 30- and 3.2-nm amorphous Si layers for the
As-implanted samples after the microwave annealing process
for 50 and 75 s. The rate of SPEG was 0.12 nm/s < 50 s and
1.12 nm/s between 50 and 75 s. After 100 s [Fig. 5(d)], the
Si layer is completely recrystallized for these lower dose As
implants.
Fig. 6 summarized the amorphous-layer thickness, which
was measured by TEM, for As- and P-implanted layers for
microwave annealing times of less than 100 s. The rates of
SPEG in the first 50 s were slow due to the gradually rising
temperature. However, the rates of SPEG increase drastically
in the range of 50–75 s, as the anneal temperature stabilizes
at about 420 ◦C. The observed slowing of the regrowth rates
for anneal times longer than 75 s for the higher dose implants

reduced only slightly, from 236.2 to 188 Ω/sq, during the six
repeated cycles of 100-s anneal times.
For lower implant doses, 1 × 1015 ion/cm2, the Rs values
for both As- and P-implanted samples were saturated at fixed
values after 100-s annealing and did not change as the anneal
exposure was increased to 600 s (see Fig. 7). This implies that
the dopant activation was nearly complete for these doses after
the 100-s microwave anneal at a peak temperature of 430 ◦C.
In addition, at this lower dose, the regrowth of the amorphous
layers created by the As and P implants was complete after
100 s [Figs. 4(d) and 5(d)]. The apparent increase in the
amorphous-layer regrowth rates for the lower dose implants,
which was especially clear for the As cases (see Fig. 6),
is opposite to the trends observed for conventional thermal
anneals of As and P at similar temperatures monitored by
optical reflectance and RBS [12].
Fig. 8 shows the SIMS profiles of the 15-keV P [Fig. 8(a)]
and 20-keV As [Fig. 8(b)] concentrations. After 1000 ◦C spike
anneals, the P profile showed substantial diffusion in the peak
and tail regions, whereas the As profile showed only a modest
broadening of the mid-range profile. All of the dopant profiles
after the low-temperature microwave anneals were indistin-

guishable from the as-implanted profiles, indicating no dopant
diffusion motion for these < 500 ◦C anneals.
The SRP profiles (Fig. 9) of the 15-keV P implants with
a dose of 5 × 1015 ion/cm2 after 50, 75, and 100 s showed
peak active dopant concentrations of 3 × 1020 carrier/cm3 after
75- and 100-s anneals. The active carried concentration at the
partially regrown amorphous-crystalline interface for the 50-s
anneal was 2 × 1019 carrier/cm3, which aligned well with the
profiles at a depth of 45 nm for the fully regrown cases for
the longer anneals. The relatively high levels of active carriers,
i.e., ≈1 × 1019 carrier/cm3, seen by the SRP analysis in the
remaining amorphous layer after the 50-s anneal (Region 2 in
Fig. 9) indicated that significant dopant annealing occurs in the
amorphous region prior to the arrival of the crystalline growth
front for the microwave annealing process.
The SPR analysis of carrier concentrations assumes a carrier
mobility taken from analysis of crystalline material. Further
detailed measurements by Hall methods of the carrier concen-
trations and mobilities in the residual amorphous Si regions
after microwave anneals would be most instructive.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, activation and deactivation of P and As im-
plants by a low-temperature (< 500 ◦C) microwave annealing
on implanted Si samples without SiC susceptors have been
demonstrated and compared. The rates of SPEG of P- and
As-implanted samples have been both evaluated, and they have
depicted low–high–low rates of SPEG during the microwave
annealing process. The rates of SPEG have been faster for the
implanted samples in a lighter dose (1 × 1015 ion/cm2) than
these in a heavier dose (1 × 1015 ion/cm2). The Rs magnitudes
of P and As at a dose of 5 × 1015 ion/cm2 could be suppressed
to 88.2 and 131 Ω/sq, respectively, as the annealing time was
extended to 300 s, after the SPEG process was completed.
As one increases the anneal time from 300 to 600 s, a small
but measureable level of dopant deactivation occurred. Finally,
from the comparisons between cross-sectional TEM pictures
and SRP profiles, there were two mechanisms of dopant

cult to fabricate short channel TFTs using the high-temperature RTA
process. However, in MWA processes, the punch-through effect can
be suppressed due to the low-temperature annealing. In addition, the

Conclusions
Extra microwave activation technique can improve the elec-
tronic mobility and suppress punch-through characteristics and short-
channel effects, as demonstrated for short channel polycrystalline Si
nMOS TFTs. In addition, crystallization by MWA was shown to have
larger grain size than crystallization by RTA, enhancing the field ef-
fect mobility. Finally, this technique is promising for realizing the
high utility rate for short channel TFTs required for applications of
AM-LCDs.

Abstract
For the first time, CMOS TFTs of 65nm channel 
length have been demonstrated by using a novel 
microwave dopant activation technique. A low temperature 
microwave anneal is demonstrated and discussed in this 
study. We have successfully activated the poly-Si gate 
electrode and source/drain junctions, BF2 for p-MOS TFTs 
and P31 for n-MOS TFTs at a low temperature of 320°C 
without diffusion. The technology is promising for high 
performance and low cost upper layer nanometer-scale 
transistors as required by low temperature 3D-ICs 
fabrication.  
1. Introduction 
The three-dimensional (3D) design in integrated 
circuits (ICs) is considered a promising solution to enhance 
the device packing density, and to reduce interconnection 
delay, power consumption, and cost (Fig. 1). However, 
dopant activation through a high thermal budget process 
may cause diffusion and redistribution of dopants in the 3D 
structure affecting the underlying interconnects and the 
device layers [1-2]. In addition, one of the main challenges 
in fabricating a nanometer-scale transistor is accurate 
control of the active doping regions. However, any high 
temperature process after implantation causes dopant 
diffusion and redistribution. High diffusion rates make a 
shallow junction depth hard to achieve. RTA has 
emissivity related pattern effect, where photon adsorption 
strongly depends on the material and temperature. 
Therefore it relies on heat transfer at the cost of undesired 
diffusion. In addition, pattern effect or shadow from upper 
stack is expected to be more significant and degrade the 
uniformity of dopant activation of devices in different 
levels of the 3D structure. 
Microwave annealing is a potential solution for 
these issues because it takes place at a low temperature that 
restrains diffusion and results in good activation. 
Microwave anneal could generate heat directly inside the 
exposed material in the form of molecular rotational or 
polarization energies and the energies are transferred 
throughout the entire material [3-4].  
Arsenic activation in a Si substrate by low 
temperature microwave anneal between the temperatures 
300~500oC has been demonstrated. The dopant diffusion is 
effectively suppressed [3]. In addition, a 3nm Ge epi-layer 
on the Si substrate was also preserved using low 
temperature microwave anneal [4]. In this work, a low 
temperature (320°C) process technique by microwave 
anneal for the application of monolithic 3D integration is 
demonstrated.  
2. Device Fabrication 
A 6” (100) bulk silicon wafer was used as the starting 
material. After a 1Pm thick silicon dioxide was thermally 
grown, a 50nm thick undoped amorphous Si film was 
deposited using low pressure chemical vapor deposition 
(LPCVD), followed by solid-phase crystallization (SPC) 
for re-crystallization. After definition of the active region 
by e-beam lithography, a gate dielectric of 45nm 
tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) oxide and a 100nm poly Si were 
deposited by LPCVD. After gate patterning, source and 
drain were implanted with BF2 (15 keV at 5×1015 cm-2) for 
p-typed metal-oxide-semiconductor thin film transistors 
(p-MOS TFTs), and with P31 (15 keV at 5×1015 cm-2) for n-
MOS TFTs respectively, followed by different dopant 
activation conditions.  
Fig. 2 compares the temperature profiles of different 
dopant activation methods. The splits of 900°C for 15 
seconds and 600°C for 12 hours annealing were used as the 
control splits. In addition, to control annealing process at 
320°C, the microwave power was turned on only for 100 
seconds, which is compared to a total of six annealing 
cycles (100×6 seconds) and a continuous 600-second 
annealing process. Fig. 3 compares the temperature 
profiles under microwave anneal measured by infrared 
detector from the backside Si wafer and the topside poly-Si 
film. The temperature profiles are almost identical as

Abstract.  In this study, we first use low temperature and short time to activate amorphous silicon. Using microwave 
annealing (MWA), the dopant in the α-Si may be well-activated and the annealing time reduced to 30 minutes. This is 
faster than conventional furnace solid phase crystallization (SPC). The temperature can be controlled at 490~540oC by 
low temperature microwave annealing than that by RTA. New microwave annealing may expand the range of a-Si 
applications and diffusionless dopant distribution to use as glass or plastic substrate. In addition, we successfully 
activated the source/drain  region, enhanced the carrier mobility and suppressed the short -channel effects by using low 
temperature microwave annealing. This technique is promising for applications of realizing high utility rate to low-cost 
nano-scaled transistors.

INTRODUCTION 
Poly-Si thin film transistors (TFTs) are potentially useful 
for the on-glass materials of the liquid crystal displays  (LCDs) 
used in h igh definit ion television receivers. The most 
important step in the fabrication process of fully integrated 
LCDs is the growth of the poly-Si films, which form the active 
TFT channel. A basic requirement during this step is that the 
maximum temperature in the film–glass substrate interface 
should not exceed the glass softening point (around 650°C). 
Solid-phase crystallization (SPC) is commonly  used to 
crystallize α -Si to form poly-Si, but this requires annealing in 
a furnace at a maximum temperature o f 600°C for 20 to 60 
hours [1] or using laser crystallization techniques such as ELA, 
is the simplest technique to obtain large-grain and smooth-
surface poly-Si . [2-4] However, furnace annealing processes 
suffer from high energy consumption and low throughput, 
since the required crystallization time is very long. 
Microwave heating may provide a lower temperature 
process that restrains diffusion and results in good activation 
[5-8]. Therefore, microwave annealing is a potential solution 
for amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon on glass or 
plastic substrate. In addition, microwave annealing does not 
result in metal contamination, meaning that the crystallized  
film may  be employed as a channel layer  [9]. Furthermore, 
microwave annealing  also has useful dopant activation in 
single-crystalline germanium [10]. The mechanisms of MW 
energy absorption in semiconductors include ohmic heating 
and dielectric relaxat ion [11–12]. In particu lar, at lower 
frequencies (<10 GHz), ohmic heating will dominate [12]. 
In this study, we used microwave heating to activate the 
dopant in an amorphous silicon layer under low temperature 
(<500
o
C) and shorter time (30minutes). Further, we also 
investigated and compared different types of dopants with 
different dosages and implant energies under microwave 
annealing with SPC and RTA. 
EXPERIMENT 
A. Material 
A 6-in-thick (100) bulk silicon wafer was used as the 
starting material. A 50-nm-thick undoped amorphous Si film 
for activate layer was deposited using low-pressure chemical 
vapor deposition (LPCVD) on a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer. 
Some wafers were implanted with P31, some with As, and 
some with BF2. The implantation energy was ranged from 10 
to 15 keV and the dose ranged from 5x10
14
 to 5x10
15
 ions/cm
2
. 
After the dopant implantation, RTA, conventional SPC 
annealing by furnace, and low temperature microwave 
annealing were used for dopant activation for material analyze.  
The sheet resistance (Rs) was measured by a four point sheet 
resistance meter, the orientation and grain size was measured 
by X-ray d iffraction and the surface roughness was measured 
by atomic force microscopy and measured the carriers’ 
mobility by Hall Effect.

In Fig 2(b), the Rs of the BF2 were very close regardless of 
their dosages and annealing methods. However, for  the As 
implanted samples, dosage is an important factor. Higher As 
dosage (5×10
15
 ion/cm
2
) increases the magnitude of the Rs 
regardless of the annealing method. Although the BF2 and As 
also have greater atomic mass and can induce more damage at 
the surface [13], boron is easier to activate than arsenic. By  
microwave annealing at a maximum temperature of 530°C and 
no boron out-diffusion, at the higher BF2 dosage (5 × 10
15
 
ion/cm
2
) its Rs was maintained at 1.5 k ohm./sq., which 
indicates that the BF2 implantation energy under higher 
dosage was independent of the resistance. 
 The XRD intensity versus the amorphous silicon films with 
by different annealing methods. The conventional SPC anneal 
can crystal the bigger grain than other annealing process. 
Using the conventional SPC process at 600°C, complete 
crystallization requires 24hrs or more hours with an incubation 
time ranging from 2 to 12 hours, depending on deposition 
temperature [14]. However, the microwave annealing process 
cannot only show the good grain size, but also reduce the 
process temperatures (below 540°C) and time. Further, the 
duration of transformation  using microwave act ivation is 
smaller, compared to conventional furnace heating. 
The surface roughness was the most important about the 
device fabrication. In figure 3 were the three annealing 
conditions measured by atomic force microscopy. The surface 
was flatness and the roughness of all kinds activation type 
were about the same.

annealed by MWA 5P 600s for different cycles. MWA 5P 
three cycles and MWA 5P two cycles could enhance Ion 
21.4X and 2.24X by  MWA 5P one cycle, respectively, but the 
Ioff were no changed. So, the Ion/Ioff ratio  also could  enhance to

 by MWA 5P 600s for three cycles. The sheet resistance 
(Rs) could  have decrease by MWA cycles number, in fig.6, 
and it could prove that the reason for Ion enhancement.

was calculated to be about 18.36V by 5P and 18.21 V 
by MWA 3P.  The phosphorus was easier to activate 
by MWA, so in n-MOS, three power was enough to 
anneal the dopant at amorphous silicon.

CONCLUSION 
The microwave activation is a low temperature 
process of polycrystalline silicon TFTs. Add the 
microwave annealing cycles can decrease the sheet 
resistance and improve the device performance. In  
addition, microwave activation technique cannot only 
suppress punch-through characteristics and short-
channel effects, but also shown to have larger grain  
size than crystallization by RTA, enhancing the field  
effect mobility. Finally, this technique is promising for 
realizing the high utility rate for short channel TFTs 
required for applicat ions of AM-LCDs.

用於超淺接面 (Ultra Shallow Junction) 的製作，甚至具備更進一步的優點
與特性，發展的前景相當值得期待。幸運的是，該會議上聽到漢辰科技
與成大電機系的李文熙老師已經申請科專計畫，並有相關的結果產生且
在該會議上發表。 
 
離子佈植是一個昂貴的研究，因為從樣品的準備到最後的分析都需要
大量的經費，此次會議中，除了漢辰科技所派出的代表以外，來自台灣
的學術界人員並不多，表示台灣在此一方面的學術人才，因為經費的關
係，所以已經慢慢地落後。因此，必須要跟業界合作才有足夠的經費來
探索這個領域。 
 
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
 
四、建議 
1.目前台灣學術界所使用的離子佈植機，僅國家奈米元件室二台，能夠
進行的摻雜種類也不多。但是事實上，離子佈植可以研究與發展的領域
卻是相當的多，後續仍然有相當多的題目可以進行研究，這必須要結合
業界來加強這個部分。 
另外，退火相關議題方面，除了雷射退火還仍然處於蓬勃發展的階
段，諸如低溫微波退火等新技術不斷地被提出。但是設備的購買似乎已
經太慢了，建議國科會要鼓勵學界進行設備的開發，建立前瞻設備的平
台，讓更多新的想法可以早一步付諸實行，而非永遠在花費大量的預算
購買難以承擔後續保固的設備。 
 
2.建議國科會要鼓勵學界多參加類似專精的國際會議，特別是可以與業界
互動的會議。透過產學的溝通，可以強化學界研究內容的產業化。 
 
五、攜回資料名稱及內容 
此次會議攜回資料有 IIT 2012會議論文集一份。 
 
六、其他

was turned on. 
 
Different implanted species, such as 31P, As, and 
BF2 are prepared for MWA. In order to evaluated the 
dopant characteristics in the implanted silicon 
substrate, samples implanted by 31P (15 keV, 5×1015 
ions/cm2), As (20 keV, 5×1015 ions/cm2) and BF2 (25 
keV, 5×1015 ions/cm2) were prepared.  
Figure 2(a) depicts Rs of 31P implant splits at 15 
keV with a dose of 5×1015 ion/cm2 for different 
annealing temperatures and times. The trends of Rs at 
different RTA temperatures suggest the presence of 
several possible mechanisms during the RTA process, 
including solid phase epitaxial growth (SPEG), de-
activation, diffusion, and out-diffusion. Small and 
stable Rs by RTA in the range of 580 to 800ºC may be 
obtained due to SPEG, with only slight dopant de-
activation impact. The Rs begins to decrease when the 
temperature exceeds 800ºC due to dopant diffusion, 
but dopant out-diffusion is seen in all splits at 1000ºC 
for 300s.

Fig. 2. (a) Rs of 31P implant splits at 15 keV with a 
dose of 5×1015 ion/cm2 at different annealing 
temperatures. (b) Rs of 31P implant splits at 15 keV

power levels. 
 
 
Therefore, the annealing temperatures of Fig. 2(a) fall 
into three regions by mechanism when only the splits 
by RTA for 100s or 300s are considered. The first such 
region lies below 580ºC and is dominated by SPEG 
with dopant activation. The second region is between 
580ºC to 800ºC and is dominated by the equilibrium 
between activation and deactivation. The third region, 
above 800ºC, is dominated by dopant diffusion and 
out-diffusion. As RTA decreases to 30s, the 
temperature must rise to 600 ºC to reach equilibrium.  
The results by MWA given in Figs. 2(a) and (b) 
show that the lower value may be reached in just 100s 
as MWA power exceeds 1.8 kW, even lower than by 
RTA in the SPEG and equilibrium regions. In addition, 
under MWA for 300s (Fig. 2(b)), Rs magnitude is 
stable in the microwave power range of 1.8 kW to 2.8 
kW, which indicates that the window of MWA power 
magnitude for stable Rs is large. As microwave power 
declines to 0.9 kW and 1.2 kW, Rs will increase 
dramatically. The results of Rs by MWA versus 
maximum substrate temperatures in Fig. 2(a) thus 
show that SPEG with dopant activation and 
equilibrium regions may be achieved without diffusion 
and out-diffusion regions. Therefore, based on Fig. 
2(a), it is possible that there is a temperature offset 
 Figure 5(a) depicts the Rs of As implanted splits at 
20 keV with a dose of 5×1015 ion/cm2 for different 
annealing temperatures and times. From the trends of 
Rs at different annealing temperatures, the possible 
annealing mechanisms during the annealing process 
appear to be the same as those of 31P implants. But, 
this will increase the temperature necessary to obtain 
small and stable Rs with only a marginal dopant de-
activation impact, but no de-activation, when the RTA 
process time is only 30s. The Rs of all splits begins to 
decrease at over 800 °C due to dopant diffusion. 
Dopant out-diffusion dominates the Rs for the split at 
1000 °C for 300s, while the shorter annealing time, 
30s,  suppress As out-diffusion. Therefore, the 
annealing temperature in Fig. 5(a) again shows three 
different mechanisms by temperature, identical to the 
31P implanted splits. However, among the RTA splits, 
there is a temperature offset for the splits by RTA for 
30s, indicating that the RTA processing time for the 
As implanted splits is an important parameter for 
SPEG with As activation.

Fig. 7. (a) Rs of BF2 implant splits at 25 keV with a 
dose of 5×1015 ion/cm2 at different annealing 
temperatures. (b) Rs of BF2 implant splits at 25 keV 
with a dose of 5×1015 ion/cm2 at different MWA 
power. 
 
Further, the MWA results given in Figs. 5(a) and (b) 
show that the lower value may be obtained after just 
100s when MWA power exceeds 1.8 kW, even lower 
than by RTA in the SPEG and equilibrium regions. In 
addition, after MWA for 300s (Fig. 5(b)), Rs 
magnitude is the lowest at 1.8 kW, and then increases 
due to dopant de-activation. Then, as microwave 
power is reduced to less than 1.8 kW, Rs will increase 
dramatically. Therefore, the results of Rs by MWA 
versus maximum substrate temperatures in Fig. 5(a) 
show that SPEG with dopant activation and 
equilibrium regions but without diffusion and out-
diffusion regions is possible. In addition, the 
magnitude of As deactivation by MWA is more 
apparent than by RTA.  
Figure 6 shows the SIMS profiles of the As (20 
keV, 5×1015 ions/cm2). After RTA at 800 °C for 300s, 
the As profile shows diffusion in the tail region, with 
substantial diffusion in the tail and peak regions after 
RTA over 900 °C. The dopant profiles after the low 
temperature MWA are indistinguishable from the 
profile of the as-implanted split, indicating no dopant 
diffusion motion for these <550 °C anneals. The 
kinetics and mechanisms of the crystallinity regrowth 
during MWA are driven by SPEG, nucleating at the 
a/c interface and proceeding toward the sample surface. 
During the crystallization of the amorphous layer, the 
dopant may be activated by SPEG. The dopant will 
then leave the lattice sites due to its dopant de-
activation characteristics, if the microwave processing 
time prolonged.  
Figure 7 (a) depicts the Rs of BF2 implanted splits 
at 25 keV with a dose of 5×1015 ion/cm2 for different 
annealing temperatures and times. By RTA, one 
requires higher annealing temperatures to complete the 
SPEG and obtain lower Rs as the annealing time 
declines, which indicates that the processing time of 
RTA for the BF2 implanted splits is an important 
parameter for SPEG with boron activation. The cross-
over behavior of Rs may then be determined. Longer 
processing times result in heavier dopant de-activation 
impact, and Rs will be suppressed due to the 
suppression of BF2 de-activation as RTA time is 
reduced. The Rs begins to decrease at temperatures 
over 800 °C due to dopant diffusion. Therefore, as 
with the other dopants, As and 31P, the annealing 
temperature in Fig. 7(a) falls into three regions. In the 
first two regions, process time dominates Rs 
characteristics, including dopant action and de-action. 
The region over 800 °C is dominated by dopant 
diffusion. The MWA results (Figs. 7(a) and (b)) show 
a clear MWA power offset across different times, 
while 200s with MWA power at 2.3 kW yields lower 
Rs values for all splits. As microwave power is 
reduced to 0.9 kW and 1.2 kW, Rs will increase 
dramatically. Therefore, the results for Rs by MWA 
versus maximum substrate temperatures show that it is 
possible to obtain SPEG with dopant activation and 
equilibrium regions but without diffusion and out-
diffusion regions.
