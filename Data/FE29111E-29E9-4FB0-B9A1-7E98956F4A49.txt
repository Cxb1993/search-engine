 
the frequency offset error efficiency. The 
resulting algorithm was found to be of identical 
form to the MUSIC-like algorithm proposed in 
[17]. In this paper, we will propose alternative 
method where the MLE is implemented in 
frequency domain. It can achieve the same 
performance as the MLE in time domain 
 
2.  Virtual Carrier Maximum 
Likelihood Estimation 
It has been known that wireless LAN 802.11a 
[7] and digital video broadcast (DVB) [10] apply 
OFDM techniques to their system. In 802.11a, 
the 64-point IFFT is used as subcarriers. Among 
them, 48 subcarriers are used for carrying data, 4 
carriers for pilot symbols as channel estimation, 
the other unused carriers are considered as 
virtual carriers. Same as 802.11a, the DVB has 
2K and 8K mode with 1704 and 6816 carriers 
for data information and pilot respectively. The 
others are virtual carriers. 
Considering N subcarriers is available for 
OFDM system. Among these carriers, each 
carrier frequencies are selected such that the 
orthogonality of OFDM symbol is achieved. 
Therefore IDFT-DFT structure is used in 
transmitter and receiver of OFDM system. If 
virtual carrier MLE is used in OFDM system, 
without loss of generality, we assume that the 
first M carriers are used as data information, the 
data on remaining N-M carriers can be assumed 
as zeros which means the N-M carriers is being 
considered as virtual carriers. The OFDM signal 
in transmitter is given in

Let U noted as the IDFT matrix given in 
U=[WNxM | QNx(N-M)], where W is the first M 
columns of U and Q is the last N-M columns of 
U. The matrix form of (1) can be written as  
x X= Wr uru . In the receiver, the signal can be 
written as 
y X= PWH + n

 It is apparent to get the 
minimum of cost function is equivalent to have 
the maximum of ln ( , )dL XφΛ
r
 and to find the 
minimum value of the projection error between 
y
r
 and space spanned by the columns of 
,⊥(PQ)  called span ( ). The property is 
given
⊥(PQ)
⊥W Q  implied . Further, it 
can check that columns of (PW, PQ) form a 
basis of N dimensional space. Thus span (
 ⊥PW PQ
⊥(PQ) ) 
is equivalent to span (PW). Thus, minimize the 
projection onto span (PQ) is equivalent to 
minimizing the projection error onto its 
orthogonal complement span (PW). 
 
3.  Post-end Virtual Carrier 
Maximum Likelihood Estimation 
 
We already have presented the virtual carrier 
maximum likelihood estimation used for 
frequency offset correction implemented in time 
domain at the receiver. An alternative method to 
achieve the same performance is proposed in this 
section where the estimator is implemented in 
frequency domain, thus we develop post-end 
MLE at the receiver as shown in Fig. 1. 
Without loss of generality, we consider 
OFDM signal at the receiver after FFT can be 
expressed as

5.  Conclusion 
 
Several approaches are proposed for carrier 
frequency offset correction and inter carrier 
interference reduction in OFDM system. The 
virtual carriers are used for the estimation of 
carrier frequency offsets without additional 
aided-data; moreover, they have a wide 
estimation range about the offset. The post-end 
MLE implement estimator in frequency domain 
show the same performance as MLE [11]. Final, 
implementations of post-end MLE with the 
space-time code in OFDM systems are proposed 
for utilizing their advantages against both 
multipath fading and frequency error.
