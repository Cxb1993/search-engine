Figure 1. Requirement of micro CMM for micro-scale products metrology 
 
The One-pulse electro-discharge (OPED) process for forming micro ball-ended styli tips has been previously 
introduced [3][4][5]. However, control of the roundness and deviation of the styli tips remains problematic 
due to the instantaneous electro-discharge shock energy. Moreover, microprobes composed of ruby or 
sapphire cannot be produced by the OPED process. The NC contour EDM machining process has been 
introduced to fabricate spherical styli tip [6], but electro-discharge craters and other defects on the styli tip 
surface render this process unacceptable due to the significant measurement irregularities of micro CMM 
metrology. In this study, a hybrid fabrication-assembly approach with combination WEDG technology [7] and 
position function of EDM was proposed to assemble micro probes for CMM. In addition, dynamic adhesion 
strength and simple profile measurements were carried out to evaluate the quality of micro spherical styli tips. 
It is expected that micro ball-ended styli will be usable on micro CMM’s probing head for micro components 
metrology in the near future.

2. Assembling and gluing process on micro EDM 
2.1. Experimental setup 
Since the development of WEDG technology, micro-EDM has become the preferred process for production of 
such micro components as micro holes, micro dies and micro tools on conductive hard materials. A micro 
electrode cantilever of only 40μm diameter can be easily produced by WEDG technology without removal 
from the spindle. Some reports pointed out that a micro cantilever with a diameter just a few micrometers can 
be fabricated by WEDG technology. This technology can obviously be applied to cantilever fabrication for 
CMM probes. The experimental equipment was based on WEDG technology. Figure 2 shows the basic 
configuration of this process. However, high accuracy position alignment is essential for the micro cantilever 
and micro ball assembling process. Therefore, in order to verify the position alignment and observe the 
assembling process, CCD1 and CCD 2 were attached to the system as shown in figure 3. A micro vacuum 
gripper with a glass ball was mounted on the table. After manufacturing the cantilever, the gluing and 
assembling processes are carried out on the same micro-EDM. CCD1 photo images on-machined 
measurement were used to evaluate the quality of micro spherical styli tips.

2.3. Glue and micro tools materials 
Varieties of glue materials are available in commercial markets. Epoxy and UV glues are widely used for 
metal and glass adhesion. The adhesion strength of the ball-ended styli should be sufficient to withstand the 
impacting force while the tactile styli tips instantaneously touch the micro-objects. Epoxy glue was selected 
for its superior adhesion strength. Several minutes are required to align the position manually for assembling 
process. In order to complete assembly of ball-ended styli in the curing process, epoxy glue with long curing 
time was applied in this study. Owing to its hardness and toughness, tungsten carbide and tungsten are popular 
materials in micro EDM.  Tungsten tends to be widely used in micro EDM because of its lower tool wear 
and toughness. This study utilized tungsten as the cantilever material.  
 
2.4 Micro ball-ended pin assembling process  
A straight micro cantilever of approximately 40μm diameter was produced using WEDG technology. To 
increase the adhesion strength, an arc-shaped cavity in the front of cantilever was fabricated by an additional 
process on the same micro EDM, as shown in figure 5. A layer of epoxy glue of approximately 0.05mm in 
thickness was sprayed on the metal plate. The epoxy glue adhered to the cantilever easily through the 
low-voltage detecting function of EDM. After step 1 and step 2 were complete, position alignment was carried 
out as illustrated in figure 5. The straight, non-rotating cantilever feeds down toward the micro ball which was 
held on the gripper manipulator. In order to prevent deformation and maintaining balanced curing, sufficient 
time is required for curing of the epoxy glue. The cantilever retains the micro ball for 12 hours after 
completion of the alignment and attachment of the micro ball, to avoid inconsistent curing.

3.2. Positioning inaccuracy alignment of micro EDM 
To assemble high quality ball-ended styli tips, micro-EDM should maintain a high-precision position 
alignment between the cantilever and micro ball. A CCD photo image measuring process was utilized to align 
the position. However, position alignment discrepancies may occur due to manual operations. The micro ball 
attached to the sidewall of cantilever occasionally deviates due to position drifting of micro EDM. This 
ball-ended styli is unsatisfactory for meeting micro CMM requirements [8]. In order to achieve high precision 
metrology of micro-CMM, the probing head needs a high precise ball-ended styli tip with accuracy in the 
sub-micro order. Precision position alignment is the key point for achieving high-quality assembling. This can 
be improved in the future through use of anti-vibration, high-resolution X- Y-stages and control systems.  
 
3.3   Styli tips measurement 
Deviation and roundness of the micro ball-ended styli play important roles in high-precision micro CMM 
metrology. The deviation between the cantilever and micro ball can result in measurement uncertainty. 
Position compensation for the deviation and roundness of ball-ended stylus tips is essential for CMM’s 
measurement software. A low-voltage detecting measurement process has been introduced to evaluate the 
metal styli tip’s quality [9]. However, this measuring process is not available for non-conductive ball-ended 
styli profile measurement. On-machined CCD photo image measurement was used temporarily to evaluate 
quality of spherical styli as shown in figure 8. Manual operations are likely to result in even lower reliability 
and greater uncertainty of the geometry measurement. However, no commercial metrology device is currently 
available to measure the geometry and profile of micro spherical styli of which the diameter is only 
approximately 0.07mm. This is the reason why on-machined images measurement was conducted as a 
temporary measure to evaluate the styli quality in this study. Figure 9 shows the CCD photo images 
measurement results of glass ball-ended styli. The eccentric error deviation between the axis of cantilever and 
the center of glass ball is as small as 0.613μm. Figure 10 shows photo images of the ball-ended styli at every 
30 degree rotation. It is difficult to visually recognize deviations in the roundness and degree of bending.

(Dia. of glass ball: 0.07mm, Dia. of shank: 0.0473mm, Length: 0.5mm) 
 
Adhesion strength will be affected by the amount of epoxy glue material and contact area between the micro 
ball and cantilever. Figure 12 shows the detecting force measurement results of glass ball-ended styli. 
Detecting force increases linearly with the moving distance when the displacement is below 26μm. However, 
the detecting force decreases rapidly at approximately 12mN as shown in this figure. The micro ball begins to 
detach from the cantilever without any bending. Figure 13 shows the views of ball-ended styli after adhesion 
strength measurement. It is obvious that the maximum static adhesion strength of glass ball is approximately 
12mN without undergoing detachment from the micro cantilever. This means that the dynamic triggering 
force should be smaller than adhesion strength when the styli tip touches micro objects.

the detecting situations as shown in figure 15. The amplitude of PZT stage was approximately 1~2μm. Micro 
spherical styli was vibrated with frequency 0.3 KHz~3 KHz and micro ball-pin on the orthogonal direction 
was moved to touch the ball-ended styli manually. The experimental results were shown in table 1. Glass ball 
is still glued onto the micro tool with low frequency vibration. However while the vibration frequency was 
larger than 3 kHz, the glass ball began to detach from the micro tool cantilever as shown in figure 16. The 
contacting force increases significantly with high vibration frequency. The cantilever tool with 40μm in 
diameter and 700μm length still maintains straightly without any bending even the gall ball detaching from 
the tool. To achieve high accuracy metrology of micro CMM, the ball-ended styli should not be allowed any 
bending and glass ball detachment when the spherical styli touches the object. This means that triggering  
force should be as low as possible when the ball-ended styli was used on CMM’s probing heads.

5. Conclusions 
 
A hybrid gluing and assembling process on micro EDM was introduced to produce micro spherical styli for 
micro CMM’s probing heads. Combining WEDG (Wire Electro Discharge Grinding) technology and a 
position controlling function of EDM, a micro ball-ended styli tip with a diameter of only 70μm could be 
successfully glued onto the front-top of cantilever. By utilizing the CCD photo image measuring process, the 
roundness of the largest profile micro ball-ended styli could be as small as 0.613μm.The spherical styli 
maintained an adhesion strength of approximately 12mN without any detachment or bending of cantilever. 
Ruby ball-ended styli for commercial CMM could be assembled successfully without any epoxy glue dripping. 
Compared to conventional process, greater control may be exerted over the deviation and roundness of 
spherical styli fabricated by assembling process. In the near future it is likely that ball-ended styli on micro 
CMM’s probing head will be utilized in micro components metrology.
