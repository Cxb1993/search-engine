composition and chemical bonding of SiCxNy films were characterized by Fourier transform 
infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The films thickness and refractive 
index were measured by N&K analyzer at 633 nm wavelength, while the hardness and Young’s 
modulus of the films were obtained by nanoindentor. The intensity of C=C and N-H peaks 
decreased significantly at higher deposition temperature due to C=C and N-H bonds scission 
resulting in crosslinking and the formation of C-N bonding. The refractive index of the SiCxNy 
films maintained lower values of 1.5-1.6. Furthermore, Young’s modulus and hardness increased 
as the deposition temperature increased because of increasing degree of cross-linked structure. 
The Young’s modulus and hardness were the highest at deposition temperature of 300 oC, and 
their values were 36 GPa and 4.9 GPa, respectively. 
 
II. Introduction 
In recent years, as integrated circuit dimension scaled according to Moore’s Law, the 
increase of propagation (RC) delay, crosstalk noise and power dissipation of the interconnect 
structure became the limiting factor for ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) devices [1]. To 
prevent the RC delay increase, aluminum was replaced by copper metallization in order to 
reduce the resistances as well as improve electromigration performance of the metal lines [2]. 
To further reduce the capacitance in the backend interconnects, low dielectric constant (k＜
3.5) material was introduced as the interlayer dielectrics (ILDs) [3]. Meanwhile, the etch-stop 
and diffusion barrier layer in the dual damascene architecture remained to be silicon nitride 
for its excellent etch selectivity and barrier effectiveness although its dielectric-constant was 
relatively high, 6.5-7.0.  In order to continue the scaling of capacitance, the semiconductor 
industry fervently pursued lower keffective, which involved the k-values of ILD, etch-stop layer, 
and their dimensions (thickness and width). Thus, silicon carbonitride (SiCxNy) film is of 
significant interests for etch-stop/diffusion barrier application due to its advantages such as 
low dielectric constant, high hardness, high strength, enhanced oxidation, corrosion resistance, 
and Cu diffusion protection [4]. 
There were various techniques to prepare the SiCxNy films, including plasma sputter 
deposition [5-7], pulsed laser deposition [8, 9], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [10], 
bias-assisted hot filament CVD [11], and plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) [12-14]. For 
PECVD deposition, precursors such as Si(CH3)4+NH3+H2, SiH4+NH3(N2)+CH4 and 
SiCl4+NH3+C3H8+H2 [15-18] were extensively used. 
In this paper, SiCxNy films were deposited by radio-frequency (RF) PECVD using 1, 3, 5 
-trimethyl-1, 3, 5- trivinylcyclotrisilazane (VSZ) as a single source precursor under various 
deposition conditions. VSZ was a good candidate precursor for SiCxNy films because its vinyl 
group can be broken up to form a cross-linked structure easily. The effects of electrode 
spacing and deposition temperatures on the chemical bonds and materials properties of 
SiCxNy films were investigated.  The chemical makeup and bonding information were 
characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS). In addition, the films deposition rates, refractive index, and mechanical 
properties such as hardness and Young’s modulus were studied. 
 
III. Experimental 
The SiCxNy films were deposited onto p-type (100) Si wafers by a radio-frequency 
(13.56 MHz) PECVD system as shown in Fig. 1, in which the diameter of substrate holder 
was 150 mm. 1, 3, 5-trimethyl-1, 3, 5- trivinylcyclotrisilazane (C9H21N3Si3, VSZ) as 
illustrated in Fig.2, was selected as the single source precursor. The precursor was vaporized 
at 80 oC and carried to the reactor using an argon carrier gas under 20 sccm flow rate. A 
shower head was implemented in the upper electrode to distribute the precursor gases 
uniformly over the substrate. The deposition pressure and RF power were kept at 92 mTorr 
and 50 W, respectively. The deposition temperatures varied from ambient to 300 oC, while the 
spacing between upper and bottom electrodes was kept at 4 cm.

Fig.3 FTIR spectrum of liquid precursor (VSZ) 
 
FTIR spectra of the SiCxNy films deposited at various deposition temperatures were 
illustrated in Figs. 4(a)-(d).  With an increase of deposition temperature, the intensities of 
Si-N and Si-C peaks increased. In contrast, the intensities of C=C and N-H peaks decreased 
with increasing deposition temperature due to the C=C and N-H bonds scission. Moreover, 
there was new and increased absorption of the C-N peak around 2100 cm-1 at higher 
deposition temperature. These indicated an increased degree of crosslinking of VSZ in the 
SiCxNy films with increasing deposition temperature.

XPS spectra of Si 2p, C 1s and N 1s for SiCxNy films, deposited at 300 oC, were shown 
in Figs. 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c), respectively. In the Si 2p spectra, two subpeaks with binding 
energies of 100.9 and 101.6 eV corresponding to Si-C and Si-N bonding were observed. The 
peaks at 282.5, 284 and 286.2 eV in C 1s spectra corresponded to C-Si, C=C and C-N 
bonding, indicating that deposition at 300 oC formed SiCxNy films with C-N bonding due to 
crosslinking. Therefore, the N 1s spectra were found two subpeaks with binding energies of 
397.7 and 400 eV corresponding to N-Si and N-C bonding, respectively [20, 21]. From C 1s

The deposition rates and refractive index of SiCxNy films as a function of deposition 
temperatures were shown in Fig.6. As the deposition temperature increased from 25 oC to 300 
oC , the deposition rates of the SiCxNy films increased from 6 nm/min to ~10 nm/min. The 
deposition rate appeared to reach a steady state at T > 200 oC. In contrast, the refractive index 
of the SiCxNy films did not change with the deposition temperature. Instead, the refractive 
index values of the SiCxNy films maintained around 1.5-1.6, which was similar to other 
common SiCxNy films with lower dielectric constant (k = 3-4) [4, 22].

Fig.6 Deposition rates and refractive index of the SiCxNy films as a function of deposition 
temperatures. 
 
The Young’s modulus and hardness of the SiCxNy films as a function of deposition 
temperatures were illustrated in Fig.7. Young’s modulus varied from 21 up to 36 GPa and 
hardness varied from 2.0 up to 4.9 GPa, as the deposition temperature increased from 25 oC to 
300 oC. With an increase of deposition temperature, the Young’s modulus and hardness of the 
SiCxNy films increased linearly due to increased degree of crosslinking, which has been 
confirmed by FTIR and XPS. The highest values of Young’s modulus and hardness obtained 
at 300 oC were 36 GPa and 4.9 GPa, respectively. This result showed that Young’s modulus 
and hardness of SiCxNy films, using VSZ precursor, were higher than the SiCxNy films 
(H=1.9-2.4 GPa and E=12.2-15.9 GPa), using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) [4], but lower 
than the other SiCxNy films (H=33 GPa and E=200 GPa), using SiH4, CH4 and N2 precursor 
[23]. For SiCxNy films based a single source precursor, VSZ precursor yielded a better 
mechanical strength than HMDS, primarily due to its vinyl groups forming a cross-linked 
structure under PECVD deposition conditions.

與會心得
The opening ceremony was expectedly long through a line of government
officials in charge of electronic policy and academia. However, keynote speech by
William Chen, who is currently the president of IEEE/CPMT Society and Technical
Adviser to ASE (USA), made the trip worthwhile. His topic– “Packaging 
Engineering between Recession and Recovery” was wel-timed and appropriate as
the world economy was still struggling after the debacle of Financial Market in 2008.
The following captured the essence of his keynote speech:
o We are in the deepest global recession since 1930.
– 2009 global outlook: -2.9% (6/23/2009, World Bank);
– 2009 China outlook: 7.2% (6/17/2009, World Bank)
o When ten top semiconductor industry analysts are deeply negative, it is time to
think about recovery.
o When recovery comes, what will be the technology landscape?
– More Moore Technology landscape
For the past 40 years, Moore’s law impacton cost improvement is 1,000,000
times, in addition transistor counts and feature size.
Push semiconductor revenue to ~250B in 2012
Semiconductor comprises 20% or more of the product cost and growing
– More than Moore Technology landscape
Consumer markets are now the center of gravity for electronics
 Fox example, Cell phones circulating the globe
Cool and fashion driven
Branding and differentiation
Time-to-market
Display and function
Application and cost
– New faces and mew players in the OBM (original Brand Marketer) and
infrastructure models
Engineering the cool product differentiation
Must items: pricing, size and weight, functions, market timing
– Packaging innovations are critical in providing the product differentiation
in the market place
o Wire bonding innovation
 Fine pitch Cu WB (20 micron)–last frontier for materials saving
 Ultra-fine gold wire (15 micron)–next technology nodes
 Multi-row QFN
o Packaging Technologies critical for mobile products
 WLCSP and WL fan-out
 Low cost flip chip
Our poster paper in Section D (DP-10) was on the Novel Pore-sealing of ordered,
porous silica, SBA-15 for Low-k Underfill Materials. In specific, polymerized
vinyl-trimethoxysilane has been synthesized in our Lab with reasonable
polydispersity index, i.e. MW distribution for pore sealing. Such approach has been
proved to effectively seal the pore on the outer surface by reducing 10.9% in
dielectric constant. Some discussion focused on our techniques for quantification of
porosity by BET. There was interested about the performance of such underfill
materials in packaging of RF device, which we will follow up in the coming year
research to validate our claims.
