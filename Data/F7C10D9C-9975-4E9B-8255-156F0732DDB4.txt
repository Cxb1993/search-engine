the transport phenomenon of the liquid-phase 
region is governed by the conditionally stable 
convection-diffusion process. The movement of 
interface, which is referred to as the 
computational mushy cell, for the current 
two-phase problem is governed by the mass and 
energy balance principles. A detailed description 
of the method and its application to various fields 
can be found in [5, 6]. The distinguished 
characteristic of the present algorithm is the 
specification of constant melting or freezing 
temperature without considering curvature and 
normal velocity effects, such as in the dendritic 
solidification [22] occuring at the center of the 
mushy cells. Thanks to this embedded feature, 
one an easily and accurately evaluate the 
boundary conditions at the interface between the 
mushy, solid and liquid cells. In comparison with 
other methods, the mushy cell tracking algorithm 
has the following distinguished features [5]: 
(1) The volume averaged property F m  is 
introduced. 
(2) Solidification or melting time is defined as a 
function of F m  
(3) Evaluation of T t¶ ¶  in the mushy cells can 
be made. 
(4) The field variables for both liquid and solid 
phases can be solved without the need of 
introducing any source term for the 
volume-averaged F m  
(5) The size of F m  is controlled by the 
mushy cell and can be reduced to a local 
point of the moving front. 
(6) The algorithm is mainly controlled by a 
conduction type energy equation. There is no 
need to calculate the temperature in the 
mushy cells since the melting temperature is 
constantly specified at the interface between 
the mushy and solid (or liquid) cells. 
(7) The mushy cells separate the domain into 
the liquid and solid zones. Consequently, the 
field variables can be solved in a 
phase-by-phase and cell-by-cell manner. 
To validate the present algorithm, both the 1D 
solidification without consideration of 
convection [14] and the melting of Tin in a 
rectangular cavity with consideration of 
convection effect [1-4, 11, 13, 15, 16] will be 
investigated. The first problem is the so-called 
Stefan problem. The predicted interface location, 
which has been known to be analytically derived, 
will be used to access the proposed numerical 
model. The second problem has been compared 
with numerical results from Hannoun et al [4]. 
The Gallium melting regarded as our application 
problem has been studied experimentally [1] and 
numerically [2-4]. Hannoun et al. [4] gave an 
excellent review of the Gallium melting problem 
and tried to resolve some previously known 
controversies. This problem will be reexamined 
in this study using the mushy cell tracking 
algorithm with an aim to clarify the 
afore-mentioned controversial problem. 
 
2. WORKING EQUATIONS 
The solidification problem is sometimes 
referred to as the Stefan problem since this 
problem was firstly published by Stefan [14] to 
study the thickness of the polar ice cap. This 
classical problem considers the energy 
conservation in the domain W  by dividing it 
into three distinct domains sW  (solid zone), 
mW  (mushy zone) and LW  (liquid zone), 
where m LsW W W WÈ È = . The flow and 
energy conservation are expressed in Eqs (1) and 
(2). It should be noted that the current study is 
investigated under the isothermal moving 
interface restriction and the internal boundary 
condition is expressed in Eq. (3) and will be 
derived later on.

where fA  is the outward normal vector of the 
fface  from the mushy cell mW  and is directed 
towards the neighboring cell of i  (solid or 
liquid) phase. Only the thermal diffusion fluxes 
from the liquid and solid phases will be included 
due to the above two main assumptions. 
As stated in Part I [5, 6], the main reason of 
choosing the mushy cell tracking equation is due 
to its applicable minimum time step to update 
mF  for every mushy cell. The minimum time 
step is determined by scrutinizing every mushy 
cell. The required minimum discrete time can be 
used to define the new front location at the 
updated time level. In addition, the associated 
essential boundary conditions are as follows:

where mLT  is the temperature between the 
mushy and liquid cells. It is worth to address that 
the advancing length of moving front is limited 
by the length of a cell in a cell-by-cell manner to 
update 
mF  for every mushy cell. The 
candidate for the mushy cells can be easily 
identified by examining the neighbors (in liquid 
state) of the newly solidified mushy cells. Thus, 
the mushy cells can be advanced in a cell-by-cell 
manner as illustrated in Fig. 2. Thanks to Eq. 
(15), one can derive the well known Stefan 
condition which was derived in a detailed 
manner in [6]. 
 
3. NUMERICAL METHODS 
The domain to be investigated is initially 
subdivided into several convex polyhedrons or 
cells. The boundaries and vertices of the cells are 
referred to as the faces and nodes, respectively. 
The neighboring cells are defined as those which 
share with a common face. All transport 
variables are stored at the cell centers. The 
resulting cells are known as the non-staggered 
cell-centered control volumes, as illustrated in 
Fig. 3. The thermally driven mushy-cell 
movement is described in Fig. 2 for the sake of 
illustration. When applying the cell-by-cell 
thermally driven mushy cell tracking algorithm, 
it is worth noting that the convection terms near 
the walls are retained because all variables are 
evaluated at the cell center rather than on a cell 
boundary. It is also worthwhile to note the 
following advantages of storing field variables at 
the cell center: 
(1) Mushy-cell can be easily identified without 
interpolating or extrapolating the moving 
front. Therefore, the computational time can 
be considerably reduced;  
(2) Heat flux into the mushy-cell can be easily 
calculated; 
(3) The number of faces of one particular cell is 
fixed so that the matrix solver can be easily 
dealt with; 
(4) The boundary temperature along the moving 
front could be easily set as the mushy 
temperature at the cell center instead of the 
melting or frozen temperature at the front. 
The interpolated or extrapolated procedures 
can, therefore, be omitted. 
 6 
diffusion fluxes at the boundaries are also 
included in 0S , and T  is applied at the center 
of the boundary. When solving Eq. (22), the 
interface temperature between the mushy and 
liquid and solid cells is specified by the constant 
melting or freezing temperature, respectively. 
The boundary diffusion flux can then be 
similarly treated as that for an interior face using 
Eq. (21). The flux 2D  at a boundary schematic 
in Fig. 2 can be written as

Where 2T  is evaluated at the center of the 
boundary face and 02  vector is measured from 
the center of the cell 0W  to the centroid of the 
boundary face. For the case with the 
Dirichlet-type boundary condition, the first term 
in Eq. (23) is treated implicitly and will be 
included in the left hand side of Eq. (22) while 
the second term in Eq. (23) is included in the 
right hand side of Eq. (22). For the case with the 
Neumann boundary condition, the specified flux 
can be directly implemented in the coarse of 
control volume integration. 
After assembling all the discretized terms 
including the convection, diffusion and source 
terms, the following linear system of equations 
for F  can be derived at each cell center:

0 0 k 1 k 1

(24) 
Here, 0W  is the volume of 0W . The notation 
nb  denotes the number of neighboring cells of 
0W . The source term 0S  contains the 
volumetric source of F  and the deferred 
correction of fF , as shown in Eq. (19). The flux 
contributions at boundaries are included in 0S  
and 0B  is the coefficient containing the 
contributions from the convection and diffusion 
fluxes. The superscript “ k ” denotes the kth 
sub-time step in the “n” time step. 
Since the pressure and the velocity 
components are stored at the cell centers, the 
mass flow rate fJ  obtained by averaging the 
cell center velocities is prone to oscillatory 
modes and checker-board pressure patterns. To 
overcome these drawbacks, the scheme [17, 23, 
27] similar to that of Rhie and Chow [28] will be 
used. At the face “ fface ” in Fig. 1, the mass 
flow rate is determined by

where *U  is the velocity field that satisfies the 
momentum conservation law. 0B  is the 
coefficient in the discrete momentum equation 
for the cell 0W  shown in Eq. (25), fPÑ
 is 
the averaged pressure gradient evaluated at the 
cell face “
fface ” and 01  is the vector measured 
from the center of 0W  to the center of 1W . 
In each momentum equation, the source term 
contains the pressure gradient, the thermal 
buoyancy force, and the stress tensor 
components not included in the standard 
diffusion term:

where the viscosity fm , the extra shear and the

averaging the cell derivatives and cell values, 
respectively. The buoyancy force due to thermal 
expansion is also evaluated at the control volume 
center.

4.1 Solidification of one-region problem 
without convection 
An example taken from [14, 21] is investigated 
for evaluating the quality of the predicted 
solid-liquid interface. The domain and the 
specified boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 
4. Since the elements with the best quality are the 
orthogonal and quadrilateral elements, three 
meshes with 100 10´ , 200 20´  and 300 30´  
resolutions are selected for the current numerical 
simulation. Under 1Lsr r= = , Lsk k 1= =  and 
LsC C 1= = , the latent heat HD  will be used 
to adjust the Stefan number St  which is defined 
as 
f surfT -TsSt = C ΔH
æ ö
ç ÷ç ÷è ø
. Initially, the liquid in 
the domain under current investigation is at rest 
and its temperature is kept at the freezing (or 
melting) temperature
fT 0= . The wall at x 0=  
is maintained at the constant temperature 
surfT 1= - . The resulting exact solution for the 
moving front is derived as S( t ) th=  in 
Appendix A. The current simulations were 
performed at the Stefan numbers of 0.1 , 2.85  
and 5 . The resulting values of h  turn out to be 
0.4400 , 1.7985  and 2.1194 , respectively. The 
simulated results for )t(S  at the Stefan number 
2.85  are shown in Fig. 5. Clearly, the simulated 
results and the analytical solutions are perfectly 
matched in the sense that the predicted 
discrepancy defined as 
num analyticS( t ) S( t )e º -  is negligibly small as 
shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The accuracy order is 
determined according to the relation ( ) nC t he » , 
where h  is defined as the characteristic length 
of a cell. Figure 7 shows that the value of n  is 
very close to 1, which can be also seen in Table 1. 
In other words, the error of the simulated 
interface location using the cell-by-cell thermally 
driven mushy cell tracking method is bounded 
by ( )O he » . The results obtained at different 
Stefan numbers are summarized in Table 1. 
 
4.2 Melting of Tin 
The melting of Tin in a square cavity will be 
investigated at the published physical data [4] 
listed in Table 2. The left and right wall 
temperatures are K508 and ,505K  respectively, 
and the bottom and top boundaries are assumed 
to be thermally adiabatic. The melting 
temperature of Tin is assumed to be .505K  The 
computed results regarding the moving front 
location and the liquid fraction compare all well 
with those given in [4], as shown in Fig. 8 and 
Fig. 9. 
 
4.3 Melting of Gallium 
Gallium melting in a rectangular cavity heated 
from the side wall has been studied 
experimentally [1] and numerically [2-4, 11, 13, 
15, 16]. The widely cited experimental results of 
Gau and Viskanta [1] will be chosen for the 
verification of the present numerical model. The 
geometrical configuration and boundary 
conditions are sketched in Fig. 10. Initially, the 
temperature in solid Gallium block is set 
at 28.3oT C= . The temperature at the left wall 
temperature is increased instantly to 38.0oT C= , 
while the right wall temperature remains 
unchanged with the initial value of 28.3oT C= . 
The physical properties used in the current 
calculations are tabulated in Table 3 [4, 20].  
Hannoun et al. [4] employed the enthalpy 
method with various discretization schemes and 
grid resolutions to study this problem. They 
found that the predicated dynamics of interface 
and thermo-fluid in the coarse meshes match 
better with the experimental data than those 
obtained from the fine meshes. In order to shed 
some light on this controversial prediction, 
several grid resolutions of unstructured and 
structured meshes as depicted in Fig. 10 are 
employed. The coarse meshes generated near 
around the interface region are very important 
since they will affect the simulated results, as 
noted in Hannoun et al. [4]. The resulting 
predicated solutions in the coarse meshes near 
the interface region can yield a better prediction 
quality as compared with the experimental data 
[1] and other numerical results [2, 3,11] shown in 
Fig. 11. 
To further address the effect of mesh resolution 
on the predicted thermo-fluid flow field and 
interface dynamics, 80*60, 90*70 and 100*71 
orthogonal, quadrilateral meshes are used. 
Comparison of the currently predicated interface 
with other numerical results is shown in Fig. 12. 
The currently predicted interface matches well 
with the numerical results of Hannoun et al. [4] 
in the early period of simulation (t < 280 sec) and 
agrees well with the other numerical results for t 
> 360 sec, as shown in Fig. 12. Comparison of 
the numerical results with the experimental data 
[1] is depicted in Fig. 13. The discrepancy
