Granular Computing (II) 
中文摘要 
本研究主旨：以前期研究計畫「透過提出完整的鄰域系統概念當作“顆粒”(granules) 來闡述 
Zadeh 所提出之“粒數學” (Granular Mathematics) 的構想，並完美地用全域的概念公理化粒
數學。」之成果為基礎，從鄰域系統的觀點來探討近似理論、及其在廣義粗略集之應用。我
們提出 “全純反身鄰域系統”(Total pure reflexive neighborhood system)的概念，並在此鄰域
系統架構下，透過所謂的上、下近似(the lower and upper and approximations) 算子，探討近似
理論。在全純反身鄰域系統的基礎上，探討廣義粗略集的結構：給定一自反二元關係 (reflexive 
relation)，我們證明其下近似算子之定點所形成的拓樸結構為 Alexandroff 拓樸；此外，在論
域為有限之限制條件下，我們提出變數精準粗略集之上、下近似算子的等價公式。 
另一方面，延續GrC 2011主講論文之成果，我們使用鄰域系統將 Ziarko 的變數精準粗略集與 
Pawlak 的古典粗略集兩概念整合為一。

Abstract 
Based on our earlier research results, the keynote speech at GrC 2011, we study the approximation 
theory via a special kind of neighborhood systems, called total pure reﬂexive neighborhood 
systems, which is a common generalization of pretopological and topological neighborhood 
systems. In the framework of such neighborhood systems, we consider the so-called lower and 
upper approximations, and we show that both of them are pre-topological invariants and dual to 
each other. We associate a total pure reﬂexive binary neighborhood system BN with a given 
reflexive relation R on the universe by mapping each object x to its R–successor set BN(x), and we 
show that the collection of all open sets generated by the lower approximation forms not only a 
topological space, but also an Alexandroﬀ space. We associate an equivalence relation to the binary 
neighborhood system BN by regarding two objects x and y as equivalent if BN(x) and BN(y) are 
identical. The induced equivalence relation is interpreted as the indiscernibility relation on the 
universe. From this view, we propose equivalent forms of lower and upper approximations. These 
enables us to extend the variable precision rough set model to variable precision binary relational 
rough set model in case of finite universe. 
In addition, in case of finite universe, we show that neighborhood system can integrate Ziarko’s 
variable precision rough set model and Pawlak’s classical rough set model into one concept.

3. 文獻探討 
Some generalizations of Pawlak approximation spaces have been made by replacing the 
equivalence relation with a more general binary relation [19,20,27,35], or the partition with a 
covering [2,4,10,11,33]. We shall simply call approximation spaces for a generalization of Pawlak 
approximation spaces. 
Topological aspects of approximation spaces were considered by various authors [9,12-14, 
23,24,31,34]. For example, Zhang et al. [34] noted that the topology induced by a preorder (i.e., a 
reﬂexive and transitive relation) is nothing but the well-known Alexandroﬀ topology. Namely, a 
topology such that the intersection of every family of open sets is open, or equivalently, every point 
has a minimal open neighborhood. The minimal open neighborhoods are the natural objects of 
study in Alexandroﬀ spaces [28]. In computing world, as pointed out in [13] that the notion of 
topology is too restrictive and that neighborhood systems will well be a fundamental notion of 
approximation in advanced computing. Viewing as a casual generalization of topology, the concept 
of neighborhood systems was ﬁrst introduced to handle approximate retrieval in database and 
information retrieval [15].  
From the very beginning, the terminology has been adopted from topological spaces; some are 
appropriate, some have over used the analogy. In the keynote speech “Granular Mathematics - 
Foundation and Current State” (by Tsau Young Lin and Yu-Ru Syau) at the 2011 IEEE 
International Conference on Granular Computing, we (re-)define definitively the important 
concepts and axiomatize the notion of neighborhood systems by global concepts. This 
axiomatization is significant, it has completed what Sierpinski had done partially in his book [25].  
 
4. 研究方法 
4.1. Preliminary 
Let U be a nonempty set (may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite) which will be the main universe of discourse 
throughout this paper. The power set of U, denoted by 2
U
, is the collection of all subsets of U, 
including the empty set (symbolized by ∅) and U itself. That is, 2U = {S | S ⊆ U}. 
Note that we use the symbol “ ⊆ ” for set inclusion. If A ⊆ B and A = B, we write A ⊂ B. By 
convention, the intersection of no sets is U and the union of no sets is ∅. 
 
Deﬁnition 1. [18] A collection A ⊆ 2U is said to meet superset condition, if for each nonempty    
 1. If N(x) ∈ NS(x), then x ∈ N(x). 
2. If N and M are members of NS(x), then N∩M ∈ NS(x). 
3. If N(x) ∈ NS(x) and N(x) ⊆ M, then M ∈ NS(x). 
4. If N ∈ NS(x), then there is member M of NS(x) such that M ⊆ N and M ∈ NS(y), ∀ y ∈ M. 
 
If the TN-axiom 4 is relaxed, then the axioms define a pretopological neighborhood system on U. 
 
4.2. Total pure reflexive neighborhood system 
   A neighborhood system NS : U →    
 
         ea   𝑥 ∈  𝑈,  NS(x) satisﬁes the first 
TN-axiom will be called a total pure reflexive (in short, TPR) neighborhood system on U. 
Deﬁnition 4. Let NS : U →   
 
 be a TPR neighborhood system. For any X ⊆ U, the NS-lower 
approximation of X, denoted by 𝑁𝑆( ) and the NS-upper approximation of X, denoted by 𝑁𝑆( ), 
from  𝑈 to itself are respectively deﬁned as follows: 
 
                                       𝑁𝑆(X) = {x ∈ U | N(x) ⊆ X, for some N(x) ∈ NS(x)}.                   (1)  
 
𝑁𝑆(X) = {x ∈ U | N(x) ∩ X = ∅, ∀ N(x) ∈ NS(x)}                     (2) 
 
Using Deﬁnition 4, we prove the following: 
Lemma 1. Let NS : U →   
 
 be a TPR neighborhood system. Then: 
 1. 𝑁𝑆(X) = U − 𝑁𝑆(U − X), ∀ X ⊆ U. 
 2. 𝑁𝑆(∅) = ∅; 𝑁𝑆(U) = U. 
 3. 𝑁𝑆(X) ⊆ X ⊆ 𝑁𝑆(X), ∀ X ⊆ U. 
 4. 𝑁𝑆(U) = U; 𝑁𝑆(∅) = ∅. 
 5. If X ⊂ Y⊆ U then 𝑁𝑆(X) ⊆ 𝑁𝑆(Y)  and 𝑁𝑆(X) ⊆ 𝑁𝑆(Y). 
 
4.2.1 Pre-topologically equivalent neighborhood systems 
   In the framework of TPR neighborhood systems, we define the concept of pre-topological 
equivalence in the following way [17]: 
Deﬁnition 5. Let NS : U →   
 
 be a TPR neighborhood system. A neighborhood system      
NS1: U →   
 
 is said to be a pre-topologically equivalent neighborhood system of NS(U) and 
each is pre-topologically equivalent to the other iff for each x ∈ U and for each neighborhood   
N1(x) ∈ NS1(x) there exists an N(x) ∈ NS(x) with N(x) ⊆ N1 (x), and conversely for each 
neighborhood N(x) ∈ NS(x) there is an N1 (x) ∈ NS1 (x) with N1 (x) ⊆ N(x). 
 Using (5), (6) and Lemma 2, we prove the following 
 
Theorem 1.. Let BN : U →  𝑈 be TPR binary neighborhood system. Then:  
1.  𝑁 :  𝑈 →  𝑈 obeys the first four KC-axioms. 
2. The collection T = { X ⊆ U |  𝑁(X) = X } of all fixed of  𝑁   𝑈   𝑈 forms an Alexandroff 
topology. 
3. In the Alexandroff space (U, T), the minimal open neighborhood of each 𝑥 ∈  𝑈 is given by 
         S(x) = ∩{ N ∈ T | N ⊇ BN(x) }                                         (7) 
 
4.3.1. Approximations in reﬂexive relations 
   Given a reﬂexive relation R ⊆ U × U, we may obtain a TPR binary neighborhood system mapping  
 
BN : x     BN(x) = {y | y ∈ U, xRy}.                                      (8) 
 
We associate an equivalence relation I(BN) on U  to the binary neighborhood system BN by 
regarding objects x and y as equivalent if BN(x) and BN(y) are identical. For (x,y) ∈ I(BN), we  
obtain at once that for any X ⊆ U, 
 
𝑥 ∈   𝑁( )        ∈   𝑁( )   and   𝑥 ∈   𝑁( )       ∈   𝑁( ).               (9) 
             
We are now in a position to state 
 
Theorem 2. Considering a reﬂexive relation R ⊆ U × U, let BN : x     BN(x) = {y | y ∈ U, xRy}. 
By  ( 𝑁) we mean the equivalence relation on 𝑈 by regarding objects 𝑥,   of 𝑈 as equivalent 
if  𝑁(𝑥)     𝑁( ), and [𝑥] (  ) denotes the equivalence class containing an object 𝑥 ∈  𝑈. 
Then:  
 
1. The family T = {X ⊆ U |  𝑁(X) = X } froms an Alexandroff topology. 
2. The minimal open neighborhood S(x) of each x in (U,T) is the intersection of all open sets 
containing the R-successor set BN(x). That is, S(x) = ∩{ N ∈ T | N ⊇ BN(x) }. 
3. The lower and upper approximations can be also described by  ( 𝑁)-elementary sets as 
shown below: 
 
 𝑁   {[𝑥] (  ) | [𝑥] (  ) ⊆     and   𝑁   {[𝑥] (  ) | [𝑥] (  )    ∅         (10) 
 
4.3.2. Variable precision binary relational rough set model 
   We now assume that the universe U is a ﬁnite set. For X ⊆ U, we write     for its cardinality. 
Let us recall [36] recall the definition of concept approximation in the variable precision rough set 
model (in short, VPRS). Any VPRS model over U is defined by a partition π=  1 ,    ,      ,      of 
U and a parameter β ∈ [0,0.5). 
   Let X ⊆ U, we define    is approximately included in X with error  , written   ⊆  , iff  
 (  ,  )    
|   𝑥|
|  |
      
Using “⊆ ” instead of “⊆”, Ziarko [36] extended the classical rough set model to the VPRS model by

报告摘要（Abstract） 
We associate a binary neighborhood system with a given binary relation, and then re-examine 
the structure of binary relational rough set model from the viewpoint of binary neighborhood
systems. Based on the associated binary neighborhood system, we define an equivalence
relation on the universe of discourse by regarding objects of the universe as equivalent if their
associated binary neighborhood systems are identical. The induced equivalence relation is
interpreted as the indiscernibility relation on the universe. From this view, we propose
equivalent form of lower and upper approximations in binary relational rough set model in
ways paralleling the corresponding definitions for Pawlak’s lower and upper approximations.
In addition, we extend variable precision rough set model to variable precision binary
relational rough set model.
