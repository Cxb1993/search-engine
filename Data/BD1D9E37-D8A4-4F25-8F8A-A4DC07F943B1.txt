二、 計畫緣由與目的 
The adaptive beamformers are of 
importance in various disciplines of signal 
processing applications ranging from radar and 
sonar to wireless communications. Various 
approaches have been addressed to design the 
weights of beamformers to effectively and 
efficiently achieve the prescribed reception 
performance [1]. 
The subband arrays, which add in a 
subband decomposition in the adaptive 
beamformers, can offer various advantages and 
have received much attention recently [2,3,4]. 
More specifically, the subband arrays in general 
exhibit faster convergence characteristics due to 
subband processing scheme [5]. Also, it is 
reported in [2] that the correlations between the 
multipath signals can be enhanced, thus 
resulting in better interference suppression 
capability. In [3], a simple linearly constrained 
minimum variance (LCMV) subband array with 
the GSC [6] as the underlying structure is 
addressed, in which a discrete Fourier transform 
(DFT) is introduced after the blocking matrix to 
render better interference cancellation and a 
faster convergence rate. To further enhance the 
performance, [4] extended the subband GSC in 
[3] by considering a statistically optimum 
subband decomposition which is also shown to 
maximize the output signal-to-interference and 
noise ratio (SINR). 
However, the inherent setback of the 
suband GSC, as the traditional GSC,  is the 
nonzero error signal, which consists of both the 
desired signal and the noise signal, in the output 
of the GSC. In addition, the practically 
imperfect subband decomposition also increases 
this error signal due to the aliasing between 
subbands. Such a nonzero error signal will 
retaliate the convergence rate of the GSC, as 
described in [7,8]. 
To alleviate this shortcoming, in this 
project, we incorporate the technique of DF with 
the subband GSC in [4], resulting a new 
beamformer possessing the advantages of both 
schemes. The technique of DF has been 
employed in the design of equalizers for 
wireless communications to cancel intersymbol 
or multipath interferences. It has also been 
recently used in adaptive arrays in symbol 
detection [9] and in the cancellation of the 
undesired desired signal in the output of the 
GSC. In light of this, this paper considers a join 
design of the statistically optimum filter bank 
decomposition of the signals passing through 
the lower branch of the GSC as well as the 
signals after the DF based on the MMSE 
criterion to render superior interference 
cancellation capability. In addition, the 
convergence rate is enhanced due to the 
subband processing scheme and the removal of 
the desired signal subband component in the 
output of the GSC via the DF. Furthermore, to 
mitigate the computational overhead in the 
determination of the subband filter coefficients, 
an iterative procedure is also addressed. The 
convergence behavior of the new beamformers 
is conducted as well to justify the rationale of 
the new approach.

These results are analogous to those derived in 
[8]. 
Simulations and Discussions 
Simulations are conducted in this section to 
verify the proposed approach. Assume that 
16=N . The GSC with the st1  order 
derivative constraint is utilized to determine the 
weights. The interference environment consists 
of three jammers with arrival angles °− 35 , 
°20  and °50  and  INRs (interference to 
noise ratios) 60dB, whereas the SNR (signal to 
noise ratio) is 0dB. Four GSCs are employed for 
comparison: the traditional GSC in [6], the 
DF-GSC in [8], the subband GSC in [4], and the 
proposed DF-subband GSC. The analysis filter 
banks G  are based on the wavelet filters in 
[10]. The number of the temporal subbands 
8=M  is considered. The comparisons of the 
beampatterns and the convergence rates, based 
on 300 independent runs, are as shown in Figs. 
2 and 3, respectively. We can note from Fig. 2  
that the proposed beamformer outperforms 
others by forming deeper nulls in the directions 
of interferences. Furthermore, the new 
beamformer, as shown in Fig. 3, yields the 
fastest convergence rate by combining the 
subband processing and the DF scheme. In light 
of this, Fig. 4, we also compare the proposed 
beamformer with and without the DF with step 
sizes 510−  and 610*5 − , respectively, as we 
show in precious section that the subband 
scheme with the DF is allowed to use a larger 
step size. We can observe that under the same 
output steady-state SINR, the proposed scheme 
exhibits a faster convergence speed. 
 
四、 計劃成果自評 
We address a new subband GSC called 
subcanceller, in which a statistically optimum 
analysis filter bank in the lower branch of the 
GSC is determined based on the MMSE 
criterion. The GSC employing the extra subband 
filter banks can result in better interference 
suppression than the one without and enhance 
the convergence speed in adaptive processing. 
Furthermore, the DF scheme is also 
incorporated with the developed subcanceller to 
yield even superior performance. The analytic 
expressions of the output SINR are determined 
and the convergence analysis is explored to 
provide further insights into the new GSCs. 
Simulation results are also furnished to justify 
the proposed approach. The research is 
presented in an international conference and is 
correspondent to the project.
