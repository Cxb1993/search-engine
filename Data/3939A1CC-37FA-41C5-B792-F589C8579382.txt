Abstract 
In this report, general structures of derivative-constrained linear-phase FIR subfilters are solved analytically. 
The frequency response of a derivative-constrained FIR filter interpolates the derivatives of the desired 
frequency response at given frequencies. We proposed universal structures for derivative-constrained 
linear-phase FIR filters. The structure consists of a linear combination of subfilters that are independent of the 
desired frequency response. We solve the subfilters analytically and demonstrate our results in several 
examples. 
Keywords: FIR filters, Taylor interpolation

There exists general expression of the solution to (2). We need the following lemma which has
been presented in [2].
Lemma 1 Let
Gk(x) =
jk
k!
[ln(1 + x)]k =
∞∑
n=0
gk[n]x
n. (4)
That is, Gk(x) is the Taylor series of j
k[ln(1 + x)]k/k! expanded at x = 0. Then the following
function
HN,k(e
jω) =
N∑
n=0
gk[n](e
−j(ω−ω0) − 1)n
satisfies
d

HN,k(e
jω)
∣∣∣∣
ω=ω0

for 0 ≤ k,  ≤ N. 
Based on above lemma, the general solution to (2) has the form.
HN(e
jω) =
N∑
k=0
dkHN,k(e
jω) (5)
We make two observations on (5). Firstly, (5) is a general expression of the solution to (2).
HN,k(e
jω) depends onN only and is independent of dk. Therefore, we will callHN,k(e
jω) as the basic
filters of the interpolation problem (2). Secondly, suggested by (5), any derivative-constrained filter
can be implemented by a structure consisting of HN,k(e
jω). Given the desired frequency response
D(ejω), if we can evaluate its derivatives dk, (5) is exactly the derivative-constrained filter with
its impulse response satisfied (3).
In this study, we will extend above result to linear-phase FIR filters. Basic filters of the 3 types
of linear-phase FIR filters will be solved. We investigate the case of ω0 = 0 for these 3 types of
FIR filters. Basic filters for general ω0 will be studied and reported in the future.

lation. Detailed derivation is similar to that in [2].

There exists general expression of the solution to (9). The following lemma gives the basic
functions.
Lemma 2 Let
Pk(x) =
[arccos(1− 2x)]k
k!

That is, Pk(x) is the Taylor series of [arccos(1 − 2x)]k/k! expanded at x = 0. Then the following
function
AM,k(ω) =

Derivation of above lemma is similar to that in [2] and is omitted here. Based on above lemma,
the general solution to (9) has the form.

2.2 Type 2 Linear-phase FIR Filters
A type 2 linear-phase FIR filter has an even symmetric impulse response and even length[1].
Specifically, hN [n] = hN [N − n] for 0 ≤ n ≤ N and N = 2M − 1 with M an integer. The
frequency response of a type 2 linear-phase FIR filter can be accordingly simplified as
HN(e
jω) = e−jωN/2BM(ω) (15)
where
BM(ω) =
M∑

for k = 0, 2, ..., 2M − 2 and  = 0, 2, ..., 2M − 2. 
Based on above lemma, the general solution to (18) has the form.
BM(ω) =
2M−2∑
k=0
k even
dkBM,k(ω) (22)
2.3 Type 3 Linear-phase FIR Filters
A type 3 linear-phase FIR filter has an odd symmetric impulse response and an odd length[1].
Specifically, hN [n] = −hN [N − n] for 0 ≤ n ≤ N and N = 2M with M an integer. The frequency
response of a type 3 linear-phase FIR filter can be accordingly simplified as
HN(e
jω) = je−jωN/2CM(ω) (23)
where
CM(ω) =
M∑
m=1
cM [m] sin ωm (24)
with
cM [m] = 2h[M −m], 1 ≤ m ≤ M. (25)
We can solve CM(ω) by derivative-constrained method. The frequency response CM(ω) satisfies
the derivative constraints

Let
dk 
dk

ω=ω0
and substitute (24) into (26), we have
M∑
m=1
cM [m]m
k sin(mω0 + kπ/2) = dk.
Substituting ω0 = 0 into above equation, we have
M∑
m=1
cM [m]m
k sin(kπ/2) = dk. (27)

A Novel Structure of FIR Filters with a Direct
Control of Derivatives of Frequency Response

Abstract—In this paper, a novel structure of finite impulse
response (FIR) filter is presented. The structure allows a direct
control of the derivatives of the frequency response and accord-
ingly can approximate any desired frequency response based on
Taylor’s theorem. The structure consists of FIR subfilters that
are parallel connected and independent of the desired frequency
response. These subfilters are derived analytically by the method
of transformation. It is found that the proposed structure is best
to implement the filters with derivative-constrained frequency
responses. Several design examples including the new structures
of variable delay filters are presented.
Keywords—Cardinal functions; maximally flat filters; variable
fractional delay filters; Stirling number of the first kind
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, design of digital filter with derivative-
constrained frequency response has gained considerable at-
tention both in theory and in practice. In theory, derivative-
constrained filters link to the wavelet theory and the polyno-
mial interpolation. In practical, derivative constraint is basic
to filter design for accurate approximation to the desired
frequency response at the frequency point of interest. The work
presented here is a filter designing method which aims at pro-
viding a novel structure of finite impulse response (FIR) filters.
The structure allows a direct control of the derivatives of the
frequency responses and is best for derivative-constrained FIR
filters.
Various derivative-constrained FIR filters have been de-
signed and reported by many researchers. When the derivative
constraints are exhausted, we obtain the maximally flat (MF)
filters. For MF fractional delay filters, closed-form expressions
of the impulse response and structures of realization were
solved and reported in [1]–[5]. The closed-forms of the
impulse response of the MF integrators and their variants can
be found in [6]–[9]. Design of MF digital differentiators and
their closed-form solution were reported in [4], [10].
An interesting problem is if universal structures exist for the
derivative-constrained FIR filters. To the best of the author’s
knowledge, no research has yet been carried out to solve
this problem. At a first glance, the derivative constraints are
different if the desired frequency responses are different. It
seems hard to find a common solution or structure of various
frequency responses. However, this is not the case. We will
show that a common closed-form solution exists for every
derivative-constrained FIR filters.
In this paper, we develop the closed-form expressions for
the derivative-constrained FIR filters based on method of
transformation. This paper is organized as follows. In Section
1, we recall basic results of derivative-constrained FIR filters
and state the unresolved problem. In Section 2 we formulate
our problem, show that any derivative-constrained FIR filters
can be represented as a linear combination of the cardinal
filters, and give a numerical solution to these filters. In section
3 we find a closed-form expression for the cardinal filters
based on method of transformation. Section 4 gives some
application examples, including closed-form expressions of the
variable fraction delay filters and differentiators. Finally, in
Section 5 we comment on the proposed results.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND NUMERICAL SOLUTION
In this section we will formulate the problem of designing
the derivative-constrained FIR filters. An N th-order FIR filter
can be characterized by its transfer function
H(z) =
N∑
n=0
h[n]z−n (1)
where h[0], h[1], . . . h[N ] are the impulse responses. The fre-
quency response is represented by
H(ejω) =
N∑
n=0
h[n]e−jnω. (2)
The derivatives of H(ejω) is equal to the ones of the desired
frequency response D(ω) at a frequency point ω0. That is,
dk
dωk
H(ejω)
∣∣∣∣
ω = ω0
=
dk
dωk
D(ω)
∣∣∣∣
ω = ω0
(3)
for 0 ≤ k ≤ R. Above linear system consists of R + 1
equations and is under determined for the impulse responses
if R ≤ N. If R = N , the impulse response can be exactly
solved, and we obtain an MF FIR filter.
It is possible for any frequency responses to represent the
derivative-constrained filter in a universal way. The idea comes
from Taylor’s theorem and is best demonstrated by an exam-
ple. Let pN (x) be an N th-degree polynomial that interpolates
the function f(x) and its derivatives at a prescribed point x0.
It is well known that pN (x) is the first N+1 terms in Taylor’s
4
where
[
n
k
]
denotes the Stirling numbers of the first kind [15].
Then
Gk(x) = (−j)
k
N∑
n=0
[
n
k
]
(−x)n
n!
. (9)
Finally, we can convert Gk(x) to Hk(ejω) by the transforma-
tion of x = e−j(ω−ω0) − 1, that is,
Hk(e
jω) = (−j)k
N∑
n=0
[
n
k
]
[1− e−j(ω−ω0)]n
n!
. (10)
Therefore, we obtain the following analytical expression of the
cardinal filter
Hk(z) = (−j)
k
N∑
n=0
[
n
k
]
(1− ejω0z−1)n
n!
. (11)
Fig. 2 shows the real parts and the imaginary parts of H1(ejω)
and H2(ejω) for N = 10 and ω0 = 0. Since H1(ejω) ≈ ω
and H2(ejω) ≈ ω2/2, the imaginary parts of the frequency
responses are closed to zero around ω = 0.
IV. DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we will present some design examples to
illustrate the applications of the cardinal FIR filters.
Example 1: Design of FIR fractional delay filters. The first
example illustrates the synthesis of the FIR fractional delay
filters. The ideal frequency response of fractional delay filter is
D(ω) = e−jτω where τ is the desired delay. The kth derivative
of the frequency response at ω0 is dk = (−jτ)ke−jτω0 .
Substituting these dk’s for (5), we obtain
H(ejω) = e−jτω0
R∑
k=0
τk
[
(−j)kHk(e
jω)
]
. (12)
Fig. 3 shows the structure of the fractional delay FIR filters im-
plemented by (12) where the subfilters Ak(z) = (−j)kHk(z).
It is exact the Farrow structure with a variable delay τ [18].
That is, we analytically solve the subfilters in the Farrow struc-
ture of MF variable fractional delay filters. These subfilters are
the cardinal filters Hk(z).
We can simplify (12) for the case of R = N, where the
corresponding transfer function is
H(z) = e−jτω0
N∑
k=0
N∑
n=0
(−τ)k
[
n
k
]
(1− ejω0z−1)n
n!
(13)
which is obtained by substituting (11) for (12) and by some
algebraic manipulations. Change the order of summations and
let
H(z) =
N∑
n=0
gn(1− e
jω0z−1)n.
We have
gn =
e−jτω0
n!
N∑
k=0
[
n
k
]
(−τ)k =
e−jτω0
n!
n∑
k=0
[
n
k
]
(−τ)k
where we use the property
[
n
k
]
= 0 for n > k. Next, using the
identity
x(x+ 1) · · · (x+ n− 1) =
n∑
k=0
[
n
k
]
xk,
we have
gn = e
−jτω0
−τ(−τ + 1) · · · (−τ + n− 1)
n!
for the special cases of ω0 = 0, gn’s are exactly the coefficients
of MF fractional delay FIR filters solved in [1] and [4]. Figs.
4a and 4b show the magnitude and group delay responses of
the MF fractional delay FIR filter in which R = N = 11 and
the delays are 5.1, 5.2, . . . 5.5. We can find that the magnitude
responses decrease as the frequency approaches π.
We can improve the frequency response easily by the
proposed structure. A complete discussion on the technique is
beyond the scope of this paper. Here we present a simple way
to keep the magnitude responses close the desired one (unity)
within the high frequency band. We still let dk = (−jτ)k for
k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1 but finding dN to satisfy
H(ejω) =
N−1∑
k=0
dkHk(e
jω) + dNHN (e
jω) = ejMω
at ω = π where M = (N − 1)/2 = 5. Note that the desired
delay at π is adjusted to M instead of the original delay τ.
Fig. 4c and 4d show the magnitude and group delay responses
of the improved design. In Fig. 4c, the magnitude responses
within (π/2, π) are much close to unity compared with the
magnitude responses in Fig. 4a. A tradeoff is a narrower
bandwidth of the group delay responses that are shown in
Fig. 4b and 4d.
Example 2: Design of FIR digital differentiator with frac-
tional delay. In this example we illustrates the synthesis of
the FIR digital differentiators with fractional delay. A closed-
from solution to the impulse response is represented in [10].
The frequency response of the ideal digital differentiator is
D(ω) = jωe−jτω where τ is the desired delay. For simplifica-
tion, let ω0 = 0. The kth derivative of the frequency response
is dk = −k(−j)kτk−1. Substituting these derivatives for (5),
we obtain
H(ejω) =
R∑
k=1
τk−1
[
−k(−j)kHk(e
jω)
]
. (14)
Fig. 5 shows the structure of the FIR digital differentiators with
variable fractional delay in which Bk(z) = −k(−j)kHk(z).
Fig. 6a and 6b show the magnitude and group delay responses
with ω0 = 0, R = N = 11, and τ = 5.1, 5.2, . . . , 5.5. From
Fig. 6a we can find that the magnitude responses degrade in the
high frequency band. We can improve the magnitude response
by imposing constraint in the high frequency band. We still
let dk = −k(−j)kτk−1 for k = 0, 1, . . . , N − 1 but solving
dN such that
H(ejω) =
N−1∑
k=0

jω) = jωejMω

Fig. 3. A structure of derivative constrained FIR fractional delay filter in
which the desired delay is τ, ω0 = 0, and Ak(z) = (−j)kHk(z). The
major difference from the variable fractional delay in the literature is that the
subfilters are expressed analytically and are the cardinal filters satisfying the
sampling property (4). If R = N , the structure represents the MF fractional
delay FIR filter.

Fig. 4. The frequency responses of the derivative constrained FIR fractional
delay filter in which N = 11, the desired delay τ = 5, 1.5.2, . . . , 5.5 and
ω0 = 0. (a) and (b) shows the magnitude and group delay responses of the
MF FIR fractional delay filters. (c) and (d) are the responses with a constraint
imposed at ω = pi. It is clear that the magnitude response in (c) is much closed
to the desired one in the high frequency band.

Fig. 5. A structure of FIR digital differentiators with variable delay in
which the desired delay is τ, ω0 = 0, and Bk(z) = −k(−j)kHk(z). This
implementation is a tunable structure and is very like the Farrow structure.
If R = N , the structure implements the MF FIR digital differentiators with
fractional delay.

Fig. 6. The frequency responses of the derivative constrained FIR differ-
entiators with fractional delay filter in which N = 11, the desired delay
τ = 5.1, 5.2, . . . , 5.5 and ω0 = 0. (a) and (b) shows the magnitude and
group delay responses of the filters. (c) and (d) are the responses with a
constraint imposed at ω = pi. It is clear that the magnitude response in (c) is
much closed to the desired one in the high frequency band with the tradeoff
of a narrower group delay response.
