二、計畫緣由與目的 (Purpose of project) 
Iron based binary alloys such as iron-palladium (FePd) and iron-platinum (FePt) can form a 
chemically long range ordered phase (L10 type), which have undergone rapid development in 
recent years because of their potential applications in future high-density magnetic storage 
media and spin electronic devices [1-10]. Magnetic L10 nanostructured materials have 
undergone rapid development in recent years because of their potential applications in future 
high-density magnetic storage media and spin electronic devices [11-14]. The most important 
aspect of a high magneto-crystalline anisotropy constant (Ku) value is that it has the ability to 
maintain enough thermal stability to resist thermal fluctuation and demagnetization effects. 
The magnetization reversal behavior of L10 ordered ferromagnetic materials with large 
uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy is of great scientific and technological interests in high 
density magnetic recording media. The L10 ordered alloys by alternate monatomic layer 
deposition is a useful method for the reduction of ordering temperature. Several works were 
focused to choose appropriate seed and buffer layers in order to obtain (001) textured FePt 
alloy films with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. However, only a few researches 
have reported the relationship between the microstructure and the magnetic properties of 
Fe/Pt multilayer films. The magnetization behavior and the magnetic mechanisms should 
strongly correlate with the morphology of films, but little work has been studied the 
magnetization reversal behavior of Fe/Pt multilayers. The first work is to demonstrate the 
thickness dependence of FePt multilayer films on the magnetization behavior and surface 
morphology changed from isolated island (discontinuous) to interconnected network 
(continuous) structures by tuning Fe/Pt bilayer numbers (nominal thickness). In this project, 
we provide a method for the fabrication of FePt isolated island or coalesced-connected films 
with (001) orientation when FePt film thickness was employed to promote this self-organized 
nanogranular/continuous microstructures at a deposition temperature of 500 oC. 
  On the other hand, the ferromagnetic ordered thin films usually showed highly 
exchange-coupled interaction between the neighboring grains due to the large grain growth 
during thermal process. So the nanocomposite and nanogranular ferromagnetic film structures 
fabricated at low-temperature conditions have attracted much attention due to the decoupling 
of intergrain interaction that could increase signal to noise ratio, which are considered more 
suitable for the next generation data storage media. Many attempts have been made to 
propose the effect of top or under layers due to which is an effective way to control the 
chemical ordering, microstructure, magnetic coupling, and crystalline orientation of the 
magnetic thin films to meet the requirements of industrial manufacture. Addition of Cu into 
the FePt films has been reported to reduce the ordering temperature and change the preferred 
orientation with magnetic anisotropy from out-of-plane to in-plane direction. The aim of this 
project is also to reduce the intergrain interaction and maintain perpendicular anisotropy of 
the FePt films by introducing the Cu capping layer atop the FePt films. This present work also 
shows significant effect in Cu/FePt system via different thicknesses of Cu capping layer on 
 4 
fundamental (002) and (004) peaks, the (001) and (003) superlattice peaks of the L10 ordered 
FePt phase have been clearly observed for all films. The unlabeled sharp peaks are due to the 
MgO (001) substrate. In Fig. 1, no peaks except the (00n) diffraction peaks are observed in 
the whole diffraction patterns (θ-2θ scan) with wide scanning range, indicating the FePt film 
structures even with the different thicknesses are strongly textured to the (001) planes and 
also confirms the structures did epitaxially grown on the Pt buffered MgO substrate. The 
intensities of all (00n) diffraction peaks of the FePt phase are getting stronger with increasing 
layer numbers n, indicating the thickness of Fe/Pt multilayer films did increase with bilayer 
numbers. Fig. 2 shows the full width at half maximum (FWHM, ω) value of the rocking 
curves of FePt (001) peak as a function of the total Fe/Pt film thickness with different [Fe/Pt] 
bilayer numbers (n). The insets are the corresponding rocking curves and FWHM values of 
the FePt (001) peak for Fe/Pt films with thickness of 10 nm and 40 nm, respectively. The FePt 
(001) peak is getting narrower as increasing total thickness of the FePt films as shown in Fig. 
1. On the other hand, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the rocking curves of 
FePt (001) is 1.326o for 10 nm, 1.176o for 20 nm, 1.044o for 30 nm, and 0.916o for 40 nm 
thick Fe/Pt films, respectively. The FWHM value decreases with increasing thickness of the 
Fe/Pt films. According to the results mentioned above, which indicates the grain size of FePt 
films is increased with increasing Fe/Pt bilayer numbers. It also implied that the texture 
alignment is getting better as increasing thickness of the Fe/Pt films due to a narrow 
distribution for c-axis orientation decreased from 1.326o (10 nm) to 0.916o (40 nm).

10 nm, (b) [Fe/Pt]10= 20 nm, (c) [Fe/Pt]15= 30 nm, and (d) [Fe/Pt]20= 40 nm, respectively. 
FePt L10 nanogranular structures are aligned along the direction of MgO [100] with (001) 
preferred orientation. The major facet planes are (100) and (010). The island boundaries of 
FePt single domain particles will work as functional pinning sites to enhance coercivity 
effectively. However, the average size of magnetic domains also increases with increasing 
film thickness. The grains of the FePt film are connected with each other until thickness is 
over 20 nm, and the structure looks like a continuous film as shown in Fig. 5(b). It can be 
understood that with increasing film thickness, particles with multiple domain coalesce and 
connect to each other to conjoin into a big grain as shown in Fig. 5(c). When FePt thickness is 
over 30 nm, the FePt films fully cover with the whole surface, and the film changes from the 
discontinuous to continuous morphology as shown in Fig. 5(d). 
In order to study the magnetization reversal behavior of the FePt films with thickness 
dependence, the angular dependence of coercivity for the FePt films ranged from 10 nm to 40 
nm were explored as shown in Fig. 6. The ideally theoretical curves, representing two 
boundary conditions of domain-wall motion and rotation of the Stoner-Wohlfarth (S-W) 
model are also shown in Fig. 6. When the FePt films is with the thickness of 10 nm, the 
profile is closer to the rotation mode due to the nanogranular films with grain isolated 
microstructure, which may decouple the intergrain exchange coupling between the FePt 
neighboring grains and the magnetization reversal behavior become more independent 
associated with incoherent rotation. The angular dependence of the coercivity profile for the 
40 nm thick FePt shows a typical peak behavior, which is closer to the domain-wall-motion 
mode; in other words, which is closer multidomain structures.

The out-of-plane and in-plane hysteresis loops for FePt films without and with a single 4 
nm thick Cu capping layer are shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b), respectively. The magnetic easy 
axis is constantly perpendicular to the film plane, and the perpendicular anisotropy is manifest 
for all films. The corresponding magnetic data including out-of-plane coercivity (Hc⊥), 
saturation magnetization (Ms⊥), and remanent squareness ratio (Mr⊥/Ms⊥) values as a function 
of the Cu layer thickness over FePt films are listed in Table I in detail. The coercivity value of 
FePt thin films increases from 3000 Oe (without Cu) to 4500 Oe (4 nm Cu). The saturation 
magnetization (Ms⊥) and remanent squareness ratio (Mr⊥/Ms⊥) values both decrease with 
increasing thickness of the Cu capping layer ranged from 915 emu/cm3 (without Cu) to 805 
emu/cm3 (4 nm Cu) and 0.98 (without Cu) to 0.9 (4 nm Cu), respectively.

五、結論 (Conclusions) 
  In summary, the thickness effect on the magnetic properties associated with surface 
morphology of perpendicular magnetized FePt (001) multilayer films has been investigated in 
this project. The total thickness of the FePt multilayer films also affects the 
exchange-coupling interaction among FePt magnetic grains and the magnetization reversal 
process. The change in the magnetization process from magnetization rotation to domain wall 
displacement with increasing thickness is clearly demonstrated as the surface morphology 
changed from isolated island to continuous film states. This present study provides a simple 
approach for fabricating high Ku continuous or nanogranular FePt (001) films via the varied 
nominal thickness with controllable coercivity and magnetization reversal behavior in general. 
On the other hand, a straightforward and simple approach is presented here showed the Cu 
single layer capped on top of the FePt films that could reduce the intergrain exchange 
coupling and thus enhance the coercivity at the relatively low deposition temperature of 300 
oC. Thus, the FePt continuous film with Cu capping layer is effective to enhance coercivity 
and reduce the coupling strength and lower noise for future applications of ultrahigh density 
perpendicular magnetic storage or spin electronic modern devices.

FePt nanostructured films with excellent material properties (mainly high 
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, Ku) have undergone rapid development in recent years 
because of their potential applications in future high-density spin electronic devices. The 
aim of this work is to demonstrate the thickness dependence of FePt films on the 
magnetization behavior and surface morphology ranged from interconnected network 
(continuous) structure to isolated (island) one. [Fe(1 nm)/Pt(1 nm)] multilayers with layer 
numbers from 5 to 20 were prepared by electron-beam deposition onto Pt buffered 
MgO(100) substrates at 500 oC. The nominal thickness (t) of FePt multilayers was varied 
from 10 nm to 40 nm as the perpendicular coercivity decreased from 9500 Oe to 4000 Oe. 
The Ku constant value increases with increasing t and shows a similar tendency following 
the slope of saturation magnetization (Ms). The Ku value ranged from 1.2 (t = 10 nm) to 
3.2×107 erg/cm3 (t = 40 nm), indicating that Ku variation is sensitive to Ms. However, the 
average size of magnetic domains increases with increasing t. It can be understood that 
with increasing t, particles with multiple domain coalesce and connect to each other. It 
indicates that strong exchange coupling exists in the continuous (thicker) films and the 
disappearance of island structure causes the decrease of coercivity. The mechanism of the 
coercivity is associated with the surface morphology changed from isolated to continuous 
states with increasing thickness. The rotation of the magnetization is considered to be a 
dominating mechanism in the isolated island films. From the measurement of angular 
dependence coercivity shows a tendency of the rotation of reverse-domain type shift 
towards domain-wall motion with increasing t. The isolated grains are less magnetically 
coupled in the rotation mode and the reversal of magnetization is more independent, as 
identified with the initial magnetization curve and Kelly-Henkel (delta M curve) plots.
