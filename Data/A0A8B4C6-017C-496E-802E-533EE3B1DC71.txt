1Abstract
Space-frequency (SF) codes used for MIMO-OFDM systems with nt transmit antennas and Q subcarriers are
considered in this report. Following from the pairwise-error-probability analysis, it is shown that in addition to
the conventional rank distance criterion, the minimum column distance of (nt × Q) SF codes serves as another
benchmark in code design. SF codes with larger minimum column distance are expected to have better pairwise
error performance. Arising from this observation, two code constructions are presented.
The first construction results from right-multiplying the now-well-known maximal rank-distance (MRD) codes
by a random, nonsingular square matrix and the resultant minimum column distance, when averaged over all
code ensembles, is shown to meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. The second construction is reminiscent of the
constructions of the Reed-Solomon codes except that the code polynomials are selected based upon the choices of
cyclotomic cosets of the underlying field. Bounds on the minimal column distance of these codes are also presented.
I. EXTENDED INTRODUCTION
Consider a MIMO-OFDM coded system with nt transmit and nr receive antennas where each OFDM
symbol consists of Q subcarriers. Channel codes used for such system are commonly referred to as an
(nt × Q) space-frequency (SF) code, which is a set of (nt × Q) matrices whose entries are drawn from
some signal constellation A. Code matrices of an (nt ×Q) SF code S are assumed to satisfy an energy
constraint, namely
ES
{‖S‖2F} = ntQ,
where ‖·‖F denotes the Frobenius norm of a matrix.
Following from [1] we assume that the MIMO channel undergoes a frequency selective fading with L
multi-paths and in addition, that the channel is fixed within each OFDM symbol period. Thus the channel
between the m-th transmit and the n-th receive antenna can be modeled in the time domain as having the
following impulse response:
hn,m(t) =
L−1∑
`=0
h(`)n,mδ(t− τ`), (1)
where h(`)n,m and τ` are respectively the channel gain and delay associated with the `-th path. The h
(`)
n,m’s
are modeled as i.i.d., circularly symmetric CN(0, σ2` ) random variables. Without loss of generality, we
will assume σ` > 0 for all `. Powers of the L paths are normalized such that
∑L−1
`=0 σ
2
` = 1.
Given the transmitted codeword S ∈ S , the OFDM transmitter first applies to each row of the codeword
matrix S a Q-point inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). After attaching to each row of the resultant
matrix a cyclic prefix of length no less than L, the m-th row of the resultant matrix is transmitted via
3information, per OFDM symbol period. It turns out that there is a tradeoff among the symbol rate Rs, the
maximal achievable minimum rank distance dr, and the maximal achievable minimum column distance
dc. We shall call it the SR-RD-CD tradeoff. The tradeoff is characterized by the proposition below.
Proposition 2: For any (nt × Q) SF code S with symbol rate Rs, minimum rank distance dr, and
minimum column distance dc, we have the following inequality:
Rs ≤ min{Q(nt − dr + 1), nt(Q− dc + 1)}. (6)
Proof: Follows from the Singleton bound argument as in [3].
Prior to further investigation, recall from the rate-diversity tradeoff [3] which states that
dr ≤ nt − Rs
Q
+ 1, (7)
and codes resulting from the unified constructions are shown in [4] to achieve this tradeoff (7) for any nt
and Q and for a wide class of signal constellations. The bound in (6) on the minimal column distance, on
the other hand, might not be tight. To see this, consider for instance the case of BPSK signal constellation,
i.e. A = F2. In this case, by viewing each column of the (nt×Q) binary matrix S as an alphabet in F2nt ,
the (nt × Q) SF code S can be regarded as a linear code of length Q over F2nt having size 2Rs , code
rate Rs/nt, and minimal Hamming distance dc. Based on this argument, the tradeoff (6) on the minimal
column distance in turn implies that if there exists a binary SF code S with Rs = nt(Q − dc + 1), then
the corresponding length-Q linear code in F2nt achieves the Singleton bound. This is in general, only
possible when Q ≤ 2nt and is achieved by the class of maximal distance separable (MDS) codes, for
instance the Reed-Solomon codes. When Q >> 2nt , which is often the case of our interest, such tradeoff
is better characterized by the Gilbert-Varshamov (G-V) bound from coding theory.
Theorem 3 (Gilbert-Varshamov bound): There exists a linear block code with length Q, rate r, and
minimum Hamming distance dc over Fq provided if
dc−2∑
j=1
(
Q− 1
j
)
(q − 1)j < qQ(1−r). (8)
Moreover, as the block length Q tends to infinity, we have that
δ = lim
Q→∞
dc
Q
≥ h−1q (1− r) , (9)
where h−1q (x) is the inverse of the entropy function given by
hq(x) = x logq(q − 1)− x logq x− (1− x) logq(1− x). (10)
This report is organized as follows. In Section II we present a construction of binary (nt×Q), Q ≥ nt, SF
codes whose rank distance meets the Singleton bound and whose column distance achieves the asymptotic
5meaning that there exists on the average, at least one pair of code matrices (S, S ′) such that the column
distance between SG and S ′G equals dc. We claim that the minimal column distance dc of the random
ensemble {SG} achieves the asymptotic G-V bound, i.e. we have the following theorem:
Theorem 4 (Random MRD Codes): For any the integer pair (nt, dr) with dr ≤ nt and for any integer
Q ≥ nt set Rs = Q(nt − dr + 1) and let SQ be a maximal rank-dr (nt × Q) binary matrix code with
size 2Rs . Let dc be the minimal column distance of the random ensemble {SQG} defined in (11); then
as Q→∞ we have
δ ≥ lim
Q→∞
dc
Q
= h−12nt
(
dr − 1
nt
)
, (12)
where h−12nt (x) is the inverse of the entropy function defined in (10). That is, the random ensemble {SQG}
achieves the asymptotic G-V bound.
Proof: See Appendix.
III. ALGEBRAIC CODE CONSTRUCTIONS
In the previous section we have shown that right-multiplying the binary rank-dr (nt ×Q) MRD code
by a random nonsingular binary square matrix G yields an (nt × Q) SF code whose minimal column
distance dc achieves the asymptotic G-V bound. Such construction, though has a good PEP performance,
is neither deterministic nor systematic. Thus in this section we will take an algebraic approach for code
constructions. The construction is presented as below.
Theorem 5: Let nt be the number of transmit antennas and let Fq be a finite field with q elements.
Let I be the set of the coset leaders of the cyclotomic cosets of Fqnt . For each s ∈ I, let rs be the size
of the cyclotomic coset associated with s and let (ks, ts) be a pair of nonnegative integers with ks ≤ rs.
Set Q = qnt − 1. Let F be the collection of code polynomials given by
F :=
{
f(x) =
∑
s∈I
ks−1∑
i=0
fi,sx
sqi+ts : fi,s ∈ Fqnt
}
. (13)
Associate with every f(x) ∈ F the (nt ×Q) matrix Cf given by
Cf :=
[
f(1), f(α), · · · , f(αQ−1)] , (14)
where by f(αj) we mean the representation of the element f(αj) as a (nt× 1) vector over Fq and where
α is a primitive element in Fqnt . Then the (nt ×Q) space-frequency code S = {Cf : f(x) ∈ F} has
symbol rate Rs =
∑
s∈I ks and minimal rank distance dr lower bounded by
dr ≥ min
s∈I : ks>0
(rs − ks + 1) . (15)
7vector space over Fq as the polynomial
∑ks−1
i=0 fi,sx
qi is an additive polynomial over Fq. Since | kerλs| ≤
deg λs(x) ≤ qks−1 provided if λs(x) is not a zero polynomial, it follows that restricting λs to the subspace
µs(Ws) yields
dim
({∑ks−1

: γb(x) ∈ Ws
}/
Fq
)
≥ dim (µs (Ws) /Fq)− dim (kerλs/Fq)
≥ rs − (ks − 1) = rs − ks + 1.
Now the proof is completed by noting that
minfi,s:Cf 6=[0] dim
({∑
s∈I
[∑ks−1
i=0 fi,s
[

:

≥ mins∈I:ks>0 dim
{∑ks−1
i=0 fi,s
(
γb
(
αsq
ts
))qi
: γb ∈ Ws
}
≥ mins∈I:ks>0 {rs − ks + 1} .
The (nt ×Q) SF code S constructed from previous theorem is in fact the representation in Fq, of the
following linear code
C = {c = [f(1)f(α) · · · f(αQ−1)] : f ∈ F} . (19)
It can be shown that C is a cyclic code with the following code generator polynomial
g(x) =
xQ + 1∏
s∈I
∏ks−1
i=0
(
x− αQ−sqi+ts) . (20)
To see the minimal column distance of S, it is convenient to begin with studying the minimal Hamming
distance of C.
Lemma 6: Let nt, Q,, Fq, and α be defined as in Theorem 5. Given the set of nonnegative integers
D = {di : i = 1, · · · , k} let C be a (Q, k) linear code given by
C = {(f(1), f(α), · · · , f(αQ−1)) :
f(x) =
k∑
i=1
fix
di , fi ∈ Fqnt
}
.
Then the minimum Hamming distance dmin of C is lower bounded by
dmin ≥ Q− min
a∈ZQ
b∈Z∗
Q
max
di∈D
{b(di − a) (mod Q)} . (21)
Proof: For any a ∈ ZQ and b ∈ Z∗Q let κa,b be the minimum positive integer such that
D ⊆ {a+ bj (mod Q) : j = 0, 1, · · · , κa,b} .
9Proposition 8: Given an (nt ×Q) binary matrix S,
|{H ∈ GLQ(F2) : H ≡S G}| =
Q−1∏
i=d
(
2Q − 2i) , (23)
where d = rank(S).
Proof: Given S, there exist E ∈ GLQ(F2) and an (nt × nt) permutation matrix P such that the
matrix product PSE can be partitioned into
PSE =
 Id
T
∣∣∣∣∣∣ 0nt×(Q−d)

for some (nt−d×d) binary matrix T . Clearly E GLQ(F2) = GLQ(F2). Now say H = EH ′ ∈ GLQ(F2);
then
PSH = PSE
 H ′1
H ′2
 =
 H ′1
TH ′1
 ,
where H ′1 and H
′
2 are respectively the (d×Q) and (nt−d×Q) submatrices of H ′. For any G,H ∈ GLQ(F2)
with G = EG′ and H = EH ′, it is clear that H ≡S G, iff SH = SG, iff PSH = PSG, iff H ′1 = G′1.
The result now follows.
Proposition 9: Given an (nt ×Q) binary matrix S,
wc(PS) = wc(S) (24)
for all P ∈ GLnt(F2).
Proof: It follows from the fact that applying any elementary row operations to S does not change
the number of non-zero columns in S.
Lemma 10: Let A(n, q) denote number of full rank (n × q) binary matrices with column weight q;
then
A(n, q) =
n∑
i=0
(−1)i
 n
n− i


2(
i

(
2n−i − 1)q , (25)
where
 n
k

2
is the Gauss binomial coefficient over F2. Moreover, for large q
A(n, q) ≈ (2n − 1)q. (26)
Proof: It follows from the inclusion/exclusion principle with help from some combinatorial counting
techniques.
Theorem 11: Given an (nt×Q) binary matrix S with rank(S) = d, let Wq(S) denote the number of
matrices with column weight q in the set S GLQ(F2), i.e.
Wq(S) = |{G ∈ GLQ(F2) : wc(SG) = q}| . (27)
