二、英文摘要 
An interesting InP/InGaAs double 
heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) with a 
step-graded InAlGaAs layers at the 
base-collector (B-C) heterojunction is 
fabricated and studied. Simulated results reveal 
that the potential spike at the base/collector 
heterointerface is completely eliminated. 
Experimentally, the operation region is wider 
than 11 decades in magnitude of collector 
current density (10-6 to 105 A/cm2). As 
compared with previous reports, the studied 
device exhibits the relatively high 
common-emitter breakdown voltage, low 
output conductance, smaller base-collector 
reverse saturation current ICBO and smaller 
multiplication factor M-1 even at high 
temperature. In the microwave characteristics 
the unity current gain cut-off frequency of fT = 
72.7 GHz and maximum oscillation frequency 
fmax = 50 GHz are achieved for a nonoptimized 
device (AE = 6 × 6 μm2).

Å n+-In0.5Ga0.5As (n+ = 2 × 1019 cm-3) cap 
layers. After epitaxy, the conventional 
photolithography, vacuum evaporation, and 
chemical wet selective etching techniques were 
used to produce the studied device. H3PO4: 
H2O2: H2O = 6: 3: 100 and HCl: H2O = 1: 1 
solutions were employed to etch the 
In(Al)(Ga)As and InP layers, respectively. 
Pt/Au was evaporated to form the base Ohmic 
contact, and AuGe/Au was used for the emitter 
and collector Ohmic contacts. The emitter area 
was 6 × 6 μm2 for studied device. The 
temperature dependent DC characteristics were 
measured by an HP4156A semiconductor 
parameter analyzer combined with a BD-8 
probe station and an HT-200 hot chuck system. 
The microwave performance was measured by 
an HP8510 network analyzer in conjunction 
with cascade probes. 
五、實驗結果與討論 
The simulated energy band diagrams near 
the B-C junction of the conventional DHBT 
and the studied device at thermal equilibrium 
are shown in Fig. 2. In this work, a designed 
step-graded junction structure is employed and 
the theoretical analysis and simulation are 
made by using the two-dimensional (2D) 
simulator ATLAS.13 The distribution of the 
base-collector barrier in the depleted collector 
region makes it possible for electrons with 
sufficient kinetic energy to transport over the 
conduction band spikes even at zero bias. The 
presence of the InGaAs setback layer near to 
the P+ InGaAs base is beneficial in minimizing 
the carrier blocking effect. Basically, this layer 
suspends the extension of the first conduction 
band spike into the base-collector space charge 
region, which can substantially block electrons 
transiting into the collector. Furthermore, the 
originally high and wide spike presented at the 
base/collector interface can be separated into 
some low and narrow spikes when the 
step-graded InAlGaAs layers are inserted 
between base-collector heterointerface. 
Therefore, the improvement of collection 
efficiency of electrons can be obtained. 
Figure 3 shows the Gummel plots of the 
studied device measured at different 
temperatures. The collector-base voltage is kept 
at VCB = 0 V. The ideality factors of the 
collector current nC and base current nB, 
measured at VBE = 0.4 V, are decreased from 
1.15 and 1.27 to 1.05 and 1.19 as the 
temperature is increased from 300 to 450 K, 
respectively. The dependences of DC current 
gain β on the collector current density JC at 
different temperatures are shown in the inset of 
Fig. 3. Clearly, the studied device exhibits 
better transistor amplification performance 
even the temperature is increased up to 450 K. 
In addition, an important advantage of the 
studied device is the current operation region of 
the desired amplification action. 
Experimentally, the β of the studied device is 
greater than unity even operated under a very 
low collector current density of JC = 6.42× 10-6 
A/cm2 (IC = 2.3 × 10-12 A) at 300 K. The 
studied device shows useful DC current gains 
over 11 orders of the magnitude of JC (10-6 
A/cm2 to 105 A/cm2). Obviously, the useful DC 
current gains at extremely low current levels 
show the promise for low-power and 
high-speed integrated circuit applications. 
Furthermore, the higher DC current gain is 
found at higher temperature as the collector 
current density is increased to JC ≧ 102 A/cm2. 
It is attributed to the high thermal collector 
leakage current with increasing the 
temperature.14 This could essentially increase 
the collector current IC and result in higher DC 
current gains. 
Figure 4 shows the common-emitter 
output I-V characteristics of the studied device 
at different temperatures. The controlled base 
current is applied at IB = 20 μA/step. Jalali et al. 
15 found that the increment of collector current 
resulted from the impact ionization is increased 
with decreasing the base width WB. Hence, 
electrons arriving at the B-C junction have 
certain energy even if the B-C junction is 
biased at low or zero voltage. When the 
 5
collector structure are mainly dominated by the 
InP layer. Based on the relatively thicker InP 
layer in our collector structure, as compared 
with the InP/InGaAs HBT with an InGaAs 
collector,21,22 the studied device exhibits 
improved breakdown performance resulting 
from the lower M-1 values. 
The DC current gain variation Δ β (%), 
under IC = 10 mA, versus the stress time of the 
studied device at the ambient temperature of 
450 K is revealed in Fig. 7. The applied 
collector-emitter voltage is kept at VCE = 3 V. 
After a 180 hr of stress test, the β of our studied 
device drops 6.89 % from its initial value. 
Experimentally, it is found that the bias stress 
could cause an increase of the base current, 
which certainly results in the decrease of the β. 
Clearly, the studied device exhibits lower Δβ  
during the life test. Previously, Wang et al. 
demonstrated that the hot electrons and holes 
are generated in the high electric field region in 
the depletion layer of the B-C junction.24 The 
majority of electrons flow into the collector 
electrode. Some of hot electrons closed to the 
peripheries of the B-C junction with sufficient 
energy, produced by the impact ionization, may 
be injected to the surface area along the 
periphery which creates the surface traps.24 
This subsequently causes the increase of 
leakage current. Furthermore, the hot 
carrier-induced damage localized at E–B and 
B–C junction peripheries could be responsible 
for the increase of B–C junction leakage and 
decrease of current gain during bias stress. 
Therefore, from Fig. 7, the studied device with 
a step-graded InAlGaAs collector structure 
exhibits the improved thermal stability and 
electrical reliability. 
 
Figure 8 shows the microwave 
characteristics of the studied device under the 
bias conditions of IC = 11.2 mA and VCE = 1.3 
V. Figure 8 shows the dependences of unity 
current gain cut-off frequency fT and maximum 
oscillation frequency fmax as a function of 
collector current IC. For a nonoptimized device 
(AE = 6 × 6 μm2), the peak fT (fmax) of the 
studied device is 72.7 GHz (50 GHz). Clearly, 
due to the employment of the step-graded 
collector structure, the studied device exhibits 
excellent microwave characteristics. The 
fall-off phenomena of fT and fmax at high 
collector current regions are caused by the Kirk 
effect25 and series resistance effect. 
六、結論 
An interesting InP/InGaAs double 
heterojunction bipolar transistor (DHBT) with a 
step-graded InAlGaAs layers at the 
base-collector (B-C) heterojunction is 
fabricated and studied. By using the 
step-graded InAlGaAs collector structure at the 
base-collector heterojunction, the current 
blocking effect is effectively eliminated. 
Experimentally, the studied device shows a 
widespread collector current operation region 
which over 11 decades in magnitude of 
collector current density (10-6 to 105 A/cm2). 
Also, the studied device shows a relatively high 
common-emitter breakdown voltage, low 
output conductance, smaller base-collector 
reverse saturation current and lower 
multiplication factor though at high 
temperature. For the microwave characteristics, 
the unity current gain cut-off frequency and 
maximum oscillation frequency of 72.7 and 
50GHz are obtained, respectively, for a 
nonoptimized device (AE = 6 × 6 μm2). 
Consequently, the studied device provides the 
promise for high-performance analogue, digital, 
and microwave device applications.

電極層與蕭特基接觸層之表面熱破壞與缺陷密度所衍生之缺失以及界面特
性不佳等習知缺失。由於此篇論文屬於以壁報張貼的方式發表論文，在張貼
論文後發現有許多人士在此佇足參觀，其中筆者的論文亦吸引不少有興趣的
專家學者發問，筆者在現場除詳細對本論文加以解說外，並與他們交換一些
