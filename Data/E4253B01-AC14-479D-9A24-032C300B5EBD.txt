each scale and orientation. We show that finding the minimal spinning tree is equiv-
alent to finding the maximal likelihood acyclic graph structure of the coefficients [2].
The minimal spinning tree derive the sibling relationship between coefficients in the
same scale and orientation. The parent and child relation is derived by assigning
the coefficients in the coarse scale is the parent of the corresponding coefficients in
the finer scale for each orientation. After the derivation of the minimal spinning
tree and the assignment of parent and child relation, we have the Bayesian network
representation in the wavelet coefficients of an image.
To forme a framework in the Bayesian network for collaborative filtering, we stack
the similar Bayesian network, that is, the coefficients of the Bayesian network are
similar, and derive from initial estimation by applying the Winer filter on coefficients
in the same stack. The estimated coefficients are then used as the observed data
in the Bayesian network. Then, the denoised coefficients are inferred by using the
message passing algorithm on the Bayesian network [5].
2 Experimental Results
We have conducted experiments and evaluated the performance of our algorithm
on several images with different levels of additive Gaussian noise. The results are
derived by using the CDF 9/7 wavelets.
Table 1 compares the noise reduction results of several method. In the table,
we have highlighted the best performance algorithm for each image. Note that our
method is superior than the current state-of-art BM3D method in almost all the
cases in the table.
Figure 1 compares the perceptual quality of the denoised images of our method
and BM3D algorithm at 10dB Gaussian additive noise. The images in the bottom
row are the results of our method. Our denoised results have a higher contrast than
those of the BM3D method.
3 Conclusion
This preliminary report shows a novel noise reduction based on combining the graph
method, the collaborative filtering, and the Markov properties in the wavelet coef-
ficients of an image. Our method does not need a complex learning algorithm to

Report of Visiting Research in China 
 
I went to visit Prof. Silong Peng’s lab in Institute of Automation, the Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, Beijing.  
 
Last year, with Silong Peng, we develop an operator-based signal separation 
algorithm which separates the single-channel signal into the sum of several 
subcomponents. And, we demonstrate that the differentiation operator can be 
used in the method to separation local narrow band signals. 
 
We discuss the idea and try to generalize it in this year. We found that the 
operator-based approach can be regarded as a generalization of the matching 
pursuits algorithm and it is a special case of the empirical mode decomposition 
algorithm. Based on the traces, we extend the method and call the generalization 
the null space pursuit. 
 
Different from the operator-based approach that we propose in last year, all the 
parameters in the null space algorithm can be derived. The parameters include 
the estimation of instantaneous frequency and the portion of the signal in the 
null space of the operator is to be removed.  
 
We demonstrate the null space pursuits on several real and toy signals. We also 
submit the paper to IEEE Tans. On Signal Processing, which title: Null Space 
Pursuit: An operator-based signal separation approach. The paper is recently 
been accepted and to be published. 
 
Because the parameters of the null space pursuits can be derived and the 
operator can be customized, the null space pursuits can be extended to extract 
more complex patterns than the instantaneous frequency. This is going to be the 
next research to be carried on. 
 
 
  
 
In this year, people mainly focused on 3D processing and 3D display. Besides, sparse 
representation (SR) and Inverse methods seems to be a promising direction.
