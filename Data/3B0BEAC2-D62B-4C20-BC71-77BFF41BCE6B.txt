ness of the machined part [5, 6]. Therefore, the
cutting force should be kept as uniform as pos-
sible to suppress chattering of the tool, and the
feedrate should also be kept as smooth as possi-
ble during the turning process.
Fuzzy logic control strategies have been ap-
plied extensively in recent years [7-9]. Such
strategies possess the special feature of the con-
troller development being model-free. There-
fore, fuzzy logic control strategies can also
be employed to control a turning system with
a complicated dynamic model. However, the
application of fuzzy logic control still needs
considerable effort to identify the appropriate
membership functions and fuzzy rules, par-
ticularly when the system is complicated or
rapidly changing. As was previously pointed
out, the turning system obviously has nonlin-
ear dynamic characteristics. These features sub-
stantially increase the difficulty in designing a
traditional fuzzy controller (TFC) for the turn-
ing system to obtain constant cutting force con-
trol.
Following the recent development of grey
theory and microprocessors, the grey control
theory is being increasingly applied in various
fields of engineering [10-12]. Fuh and Chen
[13] integrated fuzzy control techniques and
grey theory as a prior fuzzy controller to develop
a constant turning force system under a fixed
metal removal rate. The main concept of this
control strategy is that it uses the fixed metal re-
moval rate as the auxiliary controller to improve
the constant turning force control system, which
also employs a prior fuzzy controller to auto-
matically regulate the spindle speed to maintain
the fixed metal removal rate and achieve the spe-
cific appropriate value. Chou et al. [14] and
Hsieh et al. [15] also have successfully applied
a combined fuzzy logic and grey prediction al-
gorithm for developing a constant turning force
control system.
The previous studies in the literature [13-15]
employed the grey prediction algorithm to es-
timate the next step output of the system for a
look-ahead fuzzy controller, basing on the pre-
dictive system output error and error change in-
stead of current system output error and error
change, as TFC input variables. These proposed
control strategies reduce the difficulty of the
fuzzy controller implementation and improve
the control performances of the TFC, by using a
predictor for pre-compensating the system out-
put error, rather than using post-compensation.
However, most of the previous researches car-
ried out computer simulation studies of sim-
ple turning system models. This work devel-
ops a grey prediction fuzzy controller (GPFC)
to control a complex nonlinear turning system to
achieve constant cutting force control and eval-
uate control performance of the system from ex-
perimental verification.
2. System Description and Analysis
Figure 1 presents an experimental set-up
structure of the old-lathe retrofitted turning sys-
tem (OLRTS). The old lathe was obtained from
Taichung Machinery Works Company. An in-
verter was cascaded to the induction motor of
the lathe to control the spindle speed. An en-
coder was mounted on the end of the spindle
shaft of the lathe to measure its angular posi-
tion when the spindle was rotating. An AC servo
motor was installed on the gear arrangement and
drove the feed rod action; another AC servo mo-
tor was installed on the transverse feed rod to
drive the tool action along the radial direction.
A load cell was attached to the tool handle to
measure the cutting force in real time during the
turning process. This OLRTS was controlled us-
ing a compatible IBM PC Pentium IV 2.6 Ghz
that served as the central processing unit for
processing all of the system input-output data
as well as the control parameters. The requi-
site interface is a PCI-8136 card, which com-
prises a digital-to-analog part with six chan-
nels, an analog-to-digital part with six channels
and six decoding channels. The card was from
ADLINK Company.
A mathematical model was established to in-
vestigate further the dynamics of the turning
system. The dynamic characteristic in the turn-
ing process generally employs an orthogonal
model to describe it [16]. The feedrate of the
tool is assumed as a constant during the turning
process. Hence, the cutting force FR can be de-
scribed as
FR = β ·K f · f P (1)
where β is the cutting depth, f is the feedrate
of the tool, K f and P associate with the material
property of the workpiece and are constant, and
P belongs within between 1 and 0. For exam-
ple, K f and P parameters of the iron are 1450
and 0.96, respectively; the parameters of the
medium carbon steel (S45C) are K f = 2256.3
and P = 0.77.
Traditional control theory is difficult to im-
plement on this complex turning system to ap-
propriately adjust parameters of the tool fee-
drate and the cutting depth to achieve constant
cutting force control. Thus this work proposes a
model-free fuzzy control strategy to control this
complicated nonlinear turning system. Further-
more, to eliminate difficulties in finding an ap-
propriate membership function and fuzzy rules,
the GPFC also is employed to perform system
control and improve performance of the system.

where N denotes the number of data sets used to
estimate the grey parameters.
The prediction output then can be calculated
by substituting the estimated parameters into the
differential equation. The digital form of this
equation can be provided as
yˆ(1)(k) =
(
y(1)(0)− u
c
)
e−ck +
u
c
(9)
Since y(1)(0) is defined as y(0)(0), Eq (9) can be
rewritten as
yˆ(1)(k +1) =
(
y(0)(0)− u
c
)
e−ck +
u
c
(10)
Therefore, the prediction output as the (k +
1)th step can be estimated using a derivative of
the above equation as
yˆ(0)(k +1) =
(
1− e−c
)(
y(0)(0)− u
c
)
e−ck
(11)
or
yˆ(0)(k +1) = yˆ(1)(k +1)− yˆ(1)(k) (12)
This investigation accumulates the most re-
cent five output data, namely y(k−4), y(k−3),
y(k−2), y(k−1) and y(k), to forecast the next
step output yˆ(k +1) using a grey model. These
data sets are substituted into Eqs (7) and (8)
for solving the grey parameters c and u recur-
sively. The principle involved resembles that of
the forgetting factor parameter of the identifica-
tion algorithm. The system next-step output can
be predicted by substituting the grey parameters
into Eqs (10)-(12). This predicted output of the
next step is employed to calculate the predicted
next-step position error and error change in the
look-ahead fuzzy control strategy.
4. Fuzzy Logic Control
The structure of a TFC design consists of
the definition of input/output fuzzy variables,
decision-making related to fuzzy control rules,
fuzzy inference logic and defuzzification. Fig-
ure 2 presents a traditional fuzzy control struc-
ture for the OLRTS. The control system vari-
ables are defined as
ei(k) = ri(k)− yi(k) (13)
eci(k) = ei(k)− ei(k−1) (14)
where ei(k) and eci(k) are the system output er-
ror and the error change, respectively; ri(k) and
yi(k) represent the reference input of the system
and the output response of the system, respec-
tively; their subscript i = 1, 2, 3 are used to in-
dicate the spindle speed, the feedrate of the tool
and the cutting depth, respectively.
A triangular membership function, depicted
in Fig. 3, is employed to convert these input
and output variables into linguistic control vari-
ables, where S ji is a scaling factor. The subscript
i = 1, 2, 3 has descried above. The superscript
j = 1, 2, 3 are used to express the system output
error, the error change and the control output.
Fuzzy control rules for the evaluation of the
state, and are similar to the intuitive thinking of
humans, are applied:
Ri: IF z1 is Ai1 and z2 is Ai2 . . . zn is Ain then y is Ci
(15)
where z1, z2, . . ., zn and y are the system vari-
ables, also called fuzzy variables, comprising
system state variables and control variables; Ai1,
Ai2, . . ., Ain and Ci are linguistic values of fuzzy
variables that express the universe of discourse
of the fuzzy sets. Table 1 presents the fuzzy con-
trol rules employed to control this OLRTS.
The Max-Min product composite [19] is usu-
ally employed in fuzzy inference logic. The in-
ference results in a fuzzy set with membership
function B′i are,
µB′i (y) = [µAi1(x
◦
1)∧µAi2(x◦2)∧ ·· ·∧µAin(x◦n)]∧µBi(y)
= ∧ j[µAi j(x◦j)]∧µBi(y) (16)
where ∧ j[µAi j(x◦j)] is called the ”suitability of
the antecedent”. It is the result of the fuzzy com-
bination based on the current system situation
and is used to select the appropriate fuzzy con-
trol input. However, the change of suitability is
not smooth when ∧ is applied. The ∧ opera-
tion is replaced by an algebraic product herein.
Therefore, the suitability of the antecedent in
each fuzzy rule becomes
ωi = µAi1(x◦1)×µAi2(x◦2)×·· ·×µAin(x◦n)
= ∏
j
µAi j(x◦j) (17)
The corresponding suitability of each control
rule can be determined from the combination of
all antecedent conditions. The fuzzy sets must
be defuzzified to obtain the accurate control in-
put for this control system. The height method
was employed to defuzzify the output variables:
y◦ = ∑ ωi • yi∑ωi , ωi = ∏j µAi j(x
◦
j) (18)
– 4 –
improves control performance of the system.
For constant cutting force control in the turning
system, the maximum overshoot, the rise time
and the steady-state error in using the TFC are
about 2.7%, 0.5 s and 1.7%, respectively; how-
ever, using GPFC for the maximum overshoot,
the rise time and the steady-state error reduce
to approximately 1.5%, 0.3 s and 1.0%, respec-
tively, as can be seen in a comparison of Figs.
6a with 7a. Clearly, the GPFC has better control
performance in reducing overshoot and steady-
state error and accelerating rise time than does
the TFC. Additionally, the GPFC has smoother
curves in the tool feedrate and the control volt-
age of the tool feedrate than does the TFC, as
shown in a comparison of Figs. 6b with 7b, and
Figs. 6c with 7c, respectively.
5.2. constant cutting force control in variable
cutting depth
In order to investigate the effect of the vari-
able cutting depth on the cutting force, the con-
stant cutting force control is performed under
the variable cutting depth in a practical turning
process. The initial cutting depth is 1 mm. With
the time, the cutting depth reduces 0.2 mm af-
ter each 2 s interval. Figure 8 shows the output
response of the variation of the cutting depth
using the GPFC. The desired cutting force is
150 N and this case uses the GPFC to con-
trol the spindle speed to maintain 1200 rpm in
the turning process. Figures 9a and b present
the force response and the feedrate of the tool,
respectively, using the TFC. Figure 10a plots
the graphical with friendly operation interface
for the GPFC in the turning process, which is
one of the operation interfaces in the intelligent
turning system. This operative interface facili-
tates the parameter setting of the intelligent con-
troller used and monitors real time the force re-
sponse, spindle speed and cutting depth varia-
tions for constant cutting force control. Fig-
ures 10b and c present the force response and
the feedrate of the tool, respectively, using the
GPFC. The maximum overshoot in the force re-
sponse is about 48.6 % using the TFC. How-
ever, using the GPFC, the maximum overshoot
in the force response reduces to approximately
12.7%. Moreover, using the TFC and GPFC, the
steady-state errors are 1.0% and 0.5%, as shown
in Figs. 9a and 10b, respectively. Employ-
ing the GPFC for constant cutting force con-
trol under the variable cutting depth leads to a
smoother curve of the feedrate in the turning
process than does the TFC, as verified from the
contrast between Figs. 9b and 10c. Clearly, us-
ing the GPFC for constant cutting force control
under the variable cutting depth in the turning
process gives better control performance of the
system than using the TFC. In order to evalu-
ate the robustness and applicability of the pro-
posed GPFC, the rules roughly regulated for a
TFC with and without the grey predictive algo-
rithm individually employed to perform in the
turning process for the step response of the con-
stant cutting force control, as compared in Fig.
11. Under these inappropriate fuzzy parameters
and fuzzy rules, the rise time and the steady-
state error of the TFC was large; that is, the sys-
tem showed significant deviations from the de-
sired step response and almost went out of con-
trol. However, the introduction of grey predic-
tion, for the same fuzzy control rules and param-
eters, obviously improved control performance
of the system. The GPFC enhances the robust-
ness of the control system by using the grey
prediction output to pre-compensate the next-
step output error of the system. This feature
can also effectively reduce the effort required
to find the suitable membership functions and
fuzzy rules during the operation. Hence, the
GPFC not only reduces the steady-state error
and accelerates the rise time, but also facilitates
the implementation of the TFC in turning sys-
tems. Although the proposed intelligent con-
trollers (TFC and GPFC) performed on an OL-
RTS to evaluate control performance for con-
stant cutting force control, these controllers still
could be applied in existing lathes for achieving
the desired control object. In fact, the retrofitted
old lathe for a turning system can be regarded
as being one of new lathe systems. Clearly, the
proposed control strategies can be used for new
lathes as well as existing (not necessarily old)
lathes for constant cutting force control. Under
various operative conditions for constant cutting
force control, the control performance of the
GPFC outperforms that of the TFC, as verified
from experimental results.
6. Conclusion
The purposes of the constant cutting force
control are to increase the metal removal rate
and avoid breakage or wear of the tool. This
work has successfully retrofitted an old-lathe
system to evaluate control performance of the
proposed intelligent controllers for constant cut-
ting force control. Under a Windows 2000 op-
erating system, using the Borland C++ Builder
programming language these controllers were
developed for PC-Based graphical friendly in-
terface to control the OLRTS to investigate their
control performance, which facilitated imple-
mentation of these controllers in the turning pro-
cess. The GPFC can reduce the difficulties in
determining an appropriate membership func-
tion and fuzzy rules. Although the OLRTS has
nonlinear dynamic characteristics with uncer-
tainty, both TFC and GPFC performed in the
