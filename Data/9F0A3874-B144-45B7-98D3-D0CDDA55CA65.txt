with periodic structures of small poles. For example, Garcia-Vidal, et. al. [4] have 
investigated the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculation of the 
transmission of the wave through a single rectangular hole in a perfect conductor 
plate, and Garcia de Abajo and Saenz [5] have calculated the effective permittivity of 
a flat perfect conductor with such a pore structure to model surface plasmon on metal 
surfaces. Further development of the present theory along this direction would 
provide an alternative point of view on both the near field and the far field radiation 
mechanisms of these emerging interests.
研究方法
We use the method of matched asymptotic expansion to find analytically the 
multipole expansion. By using this method, we can divide the flow into two regions: 
the inner flow and outer wave regions. The method similar to Crighton [7] and Kuo 
and Dowling [8] can be applied to obtain solutions up to O(ε2) and O(ε5) for the 
inner and outer regions, respectively. We first demonstrate the solution for the rigid 
surface condition. For the inner solution, the leading order of the scattering field is a 
dipole of O(ε) due to the incident angle. A monopole also exists in the solution but 
is shown to appear at O(ε2) due to the small but non-negligible fluid compressibility. 
However, the monopole and the dipole fields become comparable in the outer wave 
region and are combined into the leading order solution in this region, which is of 
O(ε3). This is one of the few examples analytically solvable to demonstrate this 
peculiar property of acoustic waves.
The same analytical method is also applicable to the same problem but with pressure-
release surfaces. This boundary condition occurs for acoustics when sound is shed on 
free-moving surfaces, such as liquid surfaces. Though it is unlikely that any solid 
materials would reproduce this wave field acoustically, the derivation of the solution 
for this condition is still worthwhile because it is extensible to cope with other wave 
systems, such as electro-magnetic waves. The leading term in both inner and outer 
regions is a dipole perpendicular to the flanged flat surface.
結果與討論
The scattering problem is divided into an inner flow field and an outer wave field 
according to the method of matched asymptotic expansion. The inner field, described 
by the Laplace or Poisson equation, is solved by the method developed by Fabrikant, 
while the outer scattering field is described by the wave equation. By the matching 
procedures, we obtained uniformly valid multipole expansion solutions for both rigid 
and pressure-release boundaries. They are briefly summarized in Fig. (b). The only 
geometric effect of the pore after normalization with respect to the pore radius is the 
depth. It modifies the wave scattering through its influence on the effective moment

Abstract
The aim of this paper is to study the three-dimensional scattering of an oblique wave incident on a ﬂanged circular
compact pore of ﬁnite depth. The multipole structure with the scattering is resolved by the method of matched asymptotic
expansion, where we assume smallness of  ¼ ka, the product of the incident wavenumber k and the pore radius a. Two
distinguished cases are solved: the rigid boundary condition and the pressure-release boundary condition. The study
presents by far the most complete solutions to these problems, with the outer solution up to Oð5Þ and the inner solution up
to Oð2Þ. In particular, the sophisticated interplay between the pore depth and the incident angle is revealed in the different
orders of solution. It is shown that the leading order of the outer wave ﬁeld for both cases is Oð3Þ. For the rigid
boundaries, there is one dipole dependent on the incident angle and one monopole. Interestingly, the monopole arises from
the second-order interaction of the pore volume and the small but non-negligible compressibility in the inner ﬁeld. This is
one of the few examples analytically solvable to demonstrate this property. On the other hand, only one dipole is found for
the pressure-release boundary. The next order in the outer solutions for both types of the boundary conditions is of Oð5Þ
and is shown to contain quadrupoles and octupoles. The multipole structures for both types of boundaries are tabulated,
explicitly with the effects of the incident angle and the pore depth.

1. Introduction
We investigate the scattering of acoustic waves incident on a small circular pore with a ﬁnite depth
in a semi-inﬁnite ﬂat surface. The radius and the depth of the pore are both assumed to be much smaller
than the wavelength of the incident waves. Under these circumstances, a multipole expansion is
appropriate for understanding the mechanisms because of its ability to illustrate the physics in different
orders of magnitude and to express the multipole moments, or strengths, explicitly in closed forms.
The compactness of the pore is measured by a small parameter , which is deﬁned by the product of the
incident wavenumber k and the radius of the pore a. The pore depth ‘, being compact, is, therefore,
comparable to a.

plan wave is directed to the pore with an incident angle c. The coordinate is chosen such that ky ¼ 0,
i.e. symmetric with respect to the xz plane. The spherical coordinate ðs;f; yÞ and the cylindrical coordinate
ðr;f; zÞ, with r2 ¼ x2 þ y2 and s2 ¼ x2 þ y2 þ z2, are used on appropriate occasions.
The wave equation with a time harmonic proportional to expðiotÞ is
ðr2 þ k2Þpðx;oÞ ¼ 0, (1)
where p is the total sound pressure. Variables with an asterisk superscript  denote the dimensional physical
quantities. r2 is the Laplace operator and k2 is o2=c2, where o and c are the sound frequency and the
speed, respectively. The incident wave is described by pinc ¼ I expðikxx  ikz zÞ, where I is the pressure
amplitude and kx ¼ kkx ¼ k sinðcÞ and kz ¼ kkz ¼ k cosðcÞ.
There are two characteristic length scales: the wave length 1=k for the outer region, far away
from the pore, and the pore radius a for the inner region, which contains the ﬂow ﬁeld in the pore and
around the pore exit region. We normalize Eq. (1) with respect to the characteristic scales for both inner and
outer regions:
ðr2i þ 2ÞpðxÞ ¼ 0 and ðr2o þ 1ÞPðXÞ ¼ 0, (2)
where x ¼ x=a, X ¼ kx. The sound pressure is normalized against 2I. Because the acoustic wave length is
much larger than the pore radius, we have a small parameter  ¼ ka such that X ¼ x.
Interactions between the incident wave and the pore take place in the inner region. We consider two perfect
conditions: the hard surface, or no penetration condition, i.e. qp=qn ¼ 0, and the pressure-release condition,
p ¼ 0. The resultant inner ﬂow, which acts as multipole acoustic sources with determinable strengths, is then
matched to the outer wave ﬁeld. The wave ﬁeld that sees the singularities at the origin, cf. Eq. (35), is simply
wave propagation over a ﬂat surface with its boundary condition at the Z ¼ 0 plane. The matching process
reveals the types of the multipole sources.
3. Rigid reﬂective surface
After normalizing the sound pressure by 2I, the external wave ﬁeld, the incident wave and its reﬂection by
the rigid plane is pext ¼ cosðkzZÞ expðikxX Þ. It satisﬁes qp=qz ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0. This leads to the approximation in
the inner ﬂow region

From Eqs. (2)1 and (3), it is suggested that the inner expansion for the total pressure is in the form of
pðxÞ ¼ 1þ pð1ÞðxÞ þ 2pð2ÞðxÞ þ Oð3Þ. (4)
The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side is the leading term of the external ﬁeld. It is a uniform ﬁeld in the inner
region. The rest of the terms contain the induced scattering ﬁelds and higher orders of the external ﬁeld.

3.3. Far field of inner solution
We present in this section only the principal procedures of the matching without emphasizing the rigorous
details. One may verify the correctness of the results by following the routines, such as introducing an
intermediate overlapping scale as in van Dyke [13], or using a simpliﬁed version by alternating expressions
using the inner and outer variables as in Crighton [7].
The key point to match with the outer ﬁeld is to express the far-ﬁeld inner solution using the outer
coordinate variables. The inner solution of the scattering pressure obtained in the previous section is,

Apart from the leading terms of each function in Eq. (35), the higher order terms only induce the ﬂow ﬁeld in
the inner region of order higher than 3, which can be omitted in the present study. This can be seen by
expressing Eq. (31) with Eq. (32), Eqs. (33) and (35) in terms of the inner variable s and following the
arguments in Ref. [7].
Therefore, the amplitude of the leading order multipoles of the scattering wave, Eq. (32), can be
found by matching the coefﬁcients of the leading terms of Eqs. (28) and (29) with the directivity (34)1;3.

mass is discharged from the pore and becomes a monopole source. This is seen from the ﬁrst two terms of the
duct solution, (20). The monopole ﬂow is shown in Fig. 4. The strength of the monopole is linearly
proportional to the storage capability of the pore, i.e. the depth see the ﬁrst term of Eq. (29). On the
other hand, there are two ﬂow ﬁelds in this order caused by the incident angle. They have azimuthal

and is under the inﬂuence of both the ﬂuid compressibility and the incident angle, Eq. (38). The term scaling
linearly with ‘ is due to the non-vanishing second moment of the compressed mass ﬂowing into the volume.
Its moment coefﬁcient, 0B¯

the quadrupoles ð2; 0Þ and ð2; 2Þ. Their moment coefﬁcients, 2B¯ð5Þ20 and B¯

4. Pressure-release surface
4.1. Inner flow
As argued in the introduction, the solution for the pressure-release condition is valuable when extending the
current solution to systems such as electro-magnetic waves, regardless of whether there are any real materials
providing such a condition acoustically. The pressure-release condition gives pðxÞ ¼ 0 on the boundary
surface.
As in Section 3, we carry out the inner ﬂow up to a second-order accuracy. The external incident and
reﬂected waves over a pressure-release surface at z ¼ 0 are:
pext ¼ ikzz þ 2kxkzxz þ Oð3Þ
after normalizing by 2I. We denote pð1Þext ¼ ikzz and pð2Þext ¼ kxkzxz in the following derivation. Their
derivatives with respect to z are ikz and kxkzx ¼ kxkzr cosf, respectively. This expansion indicates that the
total pressure expansion of the inner region is pðxÞ ¼ pð1ÞðxÞ þ 2pð2ÞðxÞ and, subsequently, the pressures,
pð1Þ and pð2Þ, satisfy the Laplace equations: see Eq. (2)1.
The non-dimensionalized total pressures in the inner ﬂow region can be written down straightforwardly
using the same Green function in Section 3.1:

The evaluation symbol, j4, indicates that the operand is evaluated in the region rX1 at z ¼ 0 or r0X1
at z0 ¼ 0, whichever is appropriate. This is a summation of the external wave ﬁeld, pð1;2Þext ðxÞ, and the
scattering waves due to the pore. The superscript ð1;2Þ corresponds to the physical quantities of the ﬁrst or
second order.
Both ðqpð1;2Þsc =qzÞjo;4 are unknowns at the moment. For the pressure-release condition, the pressure vanishes
on the ﬂanged surface. Utilizing this condition, we bring the observation point x in Eq. (41) to the ﬂanged
surface. This gives an integral equationZ 2p

4.2. Outer wave region
In Section 4.1, the inner pressure ﬁelds for the leading two orders of magnitude are solved. Following the
same principle of the method of the matched asymptotic expansion, the outer wave ﬁeld is to be determined
from the far-ﬁeld behavior of the inner pressure, i.e. by letting s !1 in Eq. (41). However, since the
integration domain of the second integral of Eq. (41) extends to inﬁnity, this introduces unnecessary
complications in the calculation while taking the limit of s at small z. This can be avoided if we reformulate the
scattering pressure in an alternative expression,

Table 2. The effective moment coefﬁcients are plotted in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. They all vanish when
the pore depth approaches zero and well asymptote to their saturated constants when the depth is larger than
about one pore radius.
The effect of the incident angle is extracted as multiplier factors kz and ikxkz to the effective moment
coefﬁcients. They are both zero when the incident wave is parallel to the surface. This is realizable because the
external wave vanishes on the plane surface and, as a result, induces no scattering ﬁeld at the two solved
magnitudes of order. The scattering ﬁeld in this case degenerates further into higher orders and is not a
concern of the present investigation. The quadrupole ð2; 1Þ depends on the factor kxkz. Therefore, it does
not appear when the wave is normally incident on the pore and reaches its maximum when the incident
angle is at 45.

disappear from the investigated orders of magnitude when the incident wave is parallel to the ﬂanged surface,
Section 4.3. The quadrupole ð2; 1Þ scales on kxkz and exhibits a maximum when the incident angle is at 45.
There are no compressibility terms arising in this case, as it did in the rigid boundary one.
Although only a scalar equation is considered in the present study, the current theory can be applied to
more sophisticated problems. A broad family of scattering problems are currently under investigation, notable
examples being electromagnetic wave scattering and the anisotropic effect of elliptical pores. In the future, the
expansion enables us to treat the pore as an individual scatterer and, thus, to investigate the wave ﬁelds from
surfaces with various pore structures by formulating the mutual interactions as multiple scattering processes:
see Ishimaru [14].
Appendix A. Fundamentals of potential theory of mixed boundary value problems
We provide brief explanations of the two major prerequisites of Fabrikant’s potential theory of mixed
boundary value problems. They are the Poisson operatorLðlÞ and the integral representations of the inverse
of a spatial distance. Derivation of the double integral of Eq. (7) is also shown in this section as a concluding
application demonstration of the two ingredients.
Consider a function f ðr;fÞ with a periodic 2p. This function can be associated with Fourier
coefﬁcient f mðrÞ, where
f mðrÞ ¼

eimff ðr;fÞdf.
Deﬁne the Poisson operator LðlÞ for a complex l such that
LðlÞf mðrÞ ¼ ljmjf mðrÞ. (A.1)
Consequently, we have the operator properties Lðl1ÞLðl2Þ ¼Lðl1l2Þ and Lð1Þ ¼ 1.
Now, look at

The series in the integral can be evaluated analytically for jljp1 to
Lðl;f0  fÞ ¼
ð1 l2Þ
1þ l2  2l cosðf0  fÞ
and the whole equation is recast into
LðlÞf ðr;fÞ ¼ 1
2p
Z 2p
0
Lðl;f f0Þf ðr;f0Þdf0. (A.2)
This equation deﬁnes the analytical form of the operator LðlÞ for jljp1.
On the other hand, the square of the distance between two points ðr;f; zÞ and ðr0;f0; 0Þ using the polar
coordinate deﬁned in Fig. 1. is
s2 ¼ r2 þ r20  2rr0 cosðf f0Þ þ z2.
We deﬁne the new variables l1 and l2 such that the distance can be represented as
s2 ¼ l21 þ l22  2l1l2 cosðf f0Þ.
This leads to the two equations
l21 þ l22 ¼ r2 þ r20 þ z2 and l1l2 ¼ rr0

applying the ﬁrst inverse operator (8)

會議名稱 第四屆日台機械與航太工程研討會
發表論文題目 Shock oscillation of underexpanded jets impinging upon flat plates
一、參加會議經過
二、與會心得
本屆日台機棫與航太工程研討會是由日方東京工業大學 Prof. Yabe 主辦，此會議為兩年一度
之第四屆會議。本次與會代表在台灣方面共有廿餘人，包含台、成、清、交等大學多位知名
學者。而日方則包含十五位由東京工業、東京、京都、廣島等大學之教授們，研討會論文包
含數值計算、實驗等等多面向題目。
職於此次研討會中，受邀發表一與氣動力學相關的題目：”衝擊超音速噴射流之正震波的震
動”，發表後獲得諸多未來發展方向的建議：如非線性震動及穩定性分析、多相流狀況中可能
的擴展等。
在職所關注的流體力學方面，日方值得留意的研究領域有兩大方面：一是約有四篇文章探討
該研究團隊獨特的數值計算模式：CIP 方法。該法為一非保守性之半 Lagrangian 的方法，在
Prof. Ogata 等人的推展中，展示了該法對於流場中高波數解析，具有近似於頻譜法的表現。
未來該團隊將著重在該法與ＤＮＳ的比較，這是在以保守法為主的數值主流方法之外，非常
值得注意的。此方法也正被推廣至生醫血流動力學、電磁學等方面。
另一主題則是東京大學 Prof. Yoshimura 的昆蟲撲翼仿生計算及東北大學 Prof. Ishikawa 應用一
squirmer 之簡化微生物運動模型，所擴充的微生物體運動之介觀組成率的探討廣。前者可助
益於微飛行器的設計，而後者有助於了解細胞、微生物培養相關之力學行為。
我方議題則包含血流動力學(清大劉通敏)，龍卷風渦漩動力學(台大朱錦洲)，微流道固、液交
互作用，熱傳最佳化設計(逢甲宋齊有，成大鄭金祥、王覺寬)，微噴嘴設(成大趙怡欽)，衛星載具
投射(屏科大胡惠文)，火箭推進(太空中心陳彥升)等。
會後職煩請東京工大業大學 Prof. Uchida 安排參觀該校相關實驗室，該實驗室目前在從事新能
源開發，籍由引入鎂，而設計出一整套能源循環體系：包含太陽能、 鐳射、氫燃料等技術。
