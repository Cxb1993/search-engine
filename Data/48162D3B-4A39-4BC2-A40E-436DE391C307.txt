一、緣由與目的 
集水區泥砂一旦進入河道便會往庫區運移，最先入庫的渾水所挾帶的沉滓
主要為細泥，由於細泥的比重輕，縱使經過沉砂設施仍無法如同砂一樣沉澱，因
此入庫的泥多以懸浮狀態向壩址運移，在水體濁度隨著降雨持續而增加的情況
下，渾水會順勢潛入水體底層，形成上層比重較小之清水層與下層比重較大之渾
水層的水體分層現象；根據北區水資源局於 93 年艾利颱風過後在阿姆坪附近的
量測資料顯示，在水位標高 220 公尺處水體的濁度小於 200 度，但在水位標高
220 公尺處水體濁度則介於 50,000 至 200,000 度，水庫若於底層設置排砂設施能
在颱洪期間排渾蓄清，不僅降低水體濁度，並能減少泥砂淤積而延長水庫使用年
限。 
影響水庫泥砂運移與淤積的條件可分為兩種，一是影響泥砂進入水庫的質
與量的因子，影響質的因子包含泥砂粒徑、沉降速度、比重、形狀、黏性與擴散
係數等，影響量的因子包含集水區地質與地形、降雨量與降雨強度及其季節分
布、土壤特性與植被、表土冲蝕與土地開發等；一是影響水庫泥砂運移能力的因
子，包含水庫幾何如寬度、深度、形狀等，以及水理因子如坡降、粗糙度、水力
半徑、流量及其時間分布、流速及其空間分布等；這些因子並非完全獨立，有些
因子對淤砂的影響也不完全明朗。後者是控制河道河床質載(bed material load)輸
送能力的主要因素，但河床質載於水庫上游端即因流速銳減而沉降，僅剩沖洗載
(wash load)進入庫區，由此可知水庫泥砂淤積多由前者控制；至於河床質載與沖
洗載如何區分並不明確，理論上，沖洗載為河道中無法淤積的部分，可以 D10 作
為區分，然實務上常以 200 號篩(0.0625mm)區分，也是土壤分類法中，砂(sand)
與沉泥(silt)的界限。 
目前發展中之三維模式如 Neary(1995,1999)發展完全三維分流模式，假設水

4.渦動滯性(eddy viscosity)與邊界條件 
由於水深、流速、流量與底床糙度係數乃相互作用影響，渦動滯性係流場
函數而非流體性質，Elder(1959)提出垂直延散係數涵式 
*Huα=ν                              (18)

在層流狀態下，若黏滯係數為定值可使流場成二次分布，測試六組案例層數
分別為5、10、15、20、25與30層，流速剖面比較如圖3。如同預期，最大流速發
生於水面上，底部則產生回流，靜止點分別發生於底床及水面下三分之ㄧ水深
處，另由圖中可發現，當層數由5層增至10層時，流速剖面變化最大，而當層數
超過20時，流速剖面差異已可忽略。 
(2)與解析解比較 
由於層數超過20層後模擬結果差異不大，因此將20層之流速剖面模擬成果與
解析解作比較如圖4。由圖中可看出流速剖面與解析解相近，僅稍微大些，而零
流速點與解析解一致，發生於水面下三分之ㄧ水深處，而水面堆升之差異則較流
速剖面明顯，就其原因應為解析解忽略動量所致。 
(3)滯性分布型態對流速剖面之影響 
天然流場中之渦動滯性為流場之函數，並非均勻分布，接著藉由滯性分布型
態的改變對流速剖面之影響來觀察二次內插函數對求解天然流場流速剖面之能
力。Elder(1959)提出渠道中渦動滯性沿水深方向呈二次分佈，且經由Jobson and 
Sayre (1970) 由實驗觀察證實，本測試案例滯性分佈使用均勻與二次分佈兩種型
態，滯性分佈剖面與其相對之流速剖面模擬結果如圖5，結果發現，二次滯性分
佈模擬所得流速剖面於接近底床與液面處較均勻滯性分佈有較大之速度梯度，而
靠近中間水深處則流速梯度較均勻滯性平緩，此結果與符合物理現象。 
 
2.直線渠道 
由於風吹引起之環流場並無淨流量之問題，滯性大小並不會影響水深大
小，在天然河川或渠道之一維或水深平均二維模式中，河床糙度對水深之影響由
模式之底床剪應力即可反映，但在三維模式中，水深不單由底床剪應力大小決
定，水體中滯性分佈型態亦會影響水深。 
假設一矩形渠道長5km、寬100m、糙度係數0.035、底床坡降1/2000，通過單
寬流量每公尺寬3.987cms，正常水深3.0m，α值經(20)式概算為0.0304。上游邊界
速度採用使用邊界入流量平均分配於該迭代之通水斷面，下游邊界則採用率定曲
線，亦即速度之流向梯度為零，底床採不滑移邊界，側壁則採滑移邊界。

著；基於邊壁效應之概念，由於邊壁效應影響範圍厚度不大，若將底床之不滑移
邊界改成水深平均速度之一定百分比，則可用來近似邊壁效應，圖 9 為不同百分
比對無因次流速剖面之影響並與 Naot and Rodi (1982)之水槽試驗量測剖面比
較，從圖中可看出當底床速度設定為水深平均流速之 0.5 倍時，模擬所得流速剖
面已相當貼近實驗量測所得之流速剖面。

1. INTRODUCTION1
Over the past decades, two-dimensional (2D) depth-averaged numerical models have been widely
used to simulate unsteady free-surface flows in open channel, reservoir, and coastal water. The3
depth-averaged approach is computationally efficient with trade-off of discarding depth-related
information but incapable of understanding the mechanism of the natural phenomenon in which5
vertical variations of velocities are the crucial information, such as flows in channel bends, density
currents in reservoirs, or seawater intrusions in river estuaries.7
With the rapid increase in computer power in recent years, several three-dimensional (3D)
numerical models solving the Reynolds-averaged equations have been developed to simulate9
flows in natural rivers. Demuren and Rodi [1] developed a 3D model using the ‘rigid-lid’
approach, which takes the free surface into account as a symmetry plane. Hervouet and Van11
Haren [2] proposed a 3D Navier–Stokes solver in a domain with a moving boundary method,
incorporating a 2D shallow water equations solver assuming hydrostatic pressure. Because of the13
pressure field calculated by 3D Navier–Stokes solver that may locally differ from the hydrostatic
pressure, a procedure is employed to correct the free surface given by 2D shallow water equations15
according to the 3D pressure field. Meselhe and Sotiropoulos [3] presented a new code solving
Reynold-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, in which the free-surface elevation is determined by17
allowing the computational mesh to deform during the iterative solution procedure so that the
proper kinematic and dynamic conditions are satisfied at convergence. The model developed by19
Meselhe and Sotiropoulos [3] will be severely computationally time demanding for unsteady
simulations because the mesh has to be regenerated at each iteration. As volume of fluid (VOF)21
[4] method has been widely used to simulate free-surface flow in computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) and chemical engineering, the CFX-4 [5], reserving some modules can be extended by23
users for their own modeling purposes, is one of the most popular commercial CFD packages.
Faure et al. [6] embedded the treatment of inlet/outlet boundary conditions in using the CFX-4 to25
simulate flow with free surface. This treatment is indispensable to the application of common 3D
CFD codes in situ due to the lack of field velocity investigations to set up the boundary27
conditions.
As the fully 3D numerical models mentioned above are severely computationally time demanding29
and hard to be applied to the field problem due to its large demand of boundary conditions not
being investigated in situ, the layer-integrated concept with hydrostatic pressure assumption was31
proposed to simplify the 3D shallow water free-surface flow computation and has been widely used
in coastal water simulations. Li and Zhan [7] presented a multi-level finite element model with33
vertical integration for each water layer and applied to the tidal current flow in Tokyo Bay. Kim
and Lee [8] applied the finite difference model BACHOM-3 based on the multi-level concept to35
simulate the tidal and wind-induced current in Suyoung Bay, Korea. Shankar et al. [9] developed a
finite difference model using the same concept to simulate flow patterns for the sudden contraction37
and expansion flows and show reasonable flow characteristics downstream of an opening. Li and
Gu [10] applied the layer-integrated concept to the mass exchange and tidal flushing problem in the39
harbor. The multi-level or multi-layer approach allows free surface on top layer to vary with time
or iteration. The mesh does not need to be regenerated in each iteration. It significantly reduces the41
computational time consumption. In large-scale coastal simulation, this approach discards some
local phenomena but gains practicability. Lin and Falconer [11] extended the use of layer-integrated43
approach to the modeling of tidal circulation with flooding and drying in Hummer Estuary along
the northeast coast of England. Owing to the lack of mechanism on balancing the water depth45

three layer types exist, including top layer, bottom layer, and internal layer. The thickness of top

The layer-integrated equations and interface shear continuous conditions constitute the algebraic1
equation system of a water column. Consequently, the flow field can be solved implicitly in the
vertical to satisfy the boundary conditions at the bed, interface, and the free surface simultaneously.3
3.4. Computational procedure
A fully implicit time integration method is applied in the vertical direction and leads to a penta-5
diagonal system of equations with respect to the vertical direction. The vertical coupling of the
discretized momentum equations is solved implicitly in the vertical direction by the Thomas7
algorithm and column by column iteratively implicitly in the horizontal direction. The main
procedure can be summarized as follows and presented as a flowchart in Figure 3:
9
(a) Set the initial depth and velocities.
(b) Compute the eddy viscosity.11
(c) Solve the (2K +1) equations of x-momentum equation system ((23) and (29)) to obtain
velocity u for each water column by using the Thomas algorithm.13
(d) Solve the (2K +1) equations of y-momentum equation system ((24) and (30)) to obtain
velocity v for each water column by using the Thomas algorithm.15
(e) Repeat steps (c) and (d) if velocity field does not converge.
(f) The vertical velocity w and water depth H are determined by Equations (9) and (10),17
respectively.
(g) Repeat steps (b)–(f) until both velocity and depth converge, then march to the next time19
step.
3.5. Numerical stability limitations21
The momentum equations were solved by using a combined implicit (vertical) and iteratively
implicit (horizontal) schemes, but the continuity equation was solved explicitly. For the 3D shallow23
water equations, the horizontal velocity components are coupled in the vertical direction by the
vertical advection and viscosity term. An explicit time integration of the vertical exchange in25
shallow areas would lead to the time step limitations [13]:

4. ESTIMATION OF EDDY VISCOSITY FOR CHANNEL FLOWS
The law of flow resistance in open channel flow can be derived by balancing the retarding shear31
force at the boundary against the propulsive force acting in the flow direction. The water depth
is determined by the interaction of the mean flow and bottom roughness in 1D or plane 2D33
simulations. But from the point of view of 3D modeling, the bottom roughness only acts on the
bottom layer. Hence, the velocity profile is determined not only by the mean flow discharge and35

bottom friction but also by the eddy viscosity, an improper use of eddy viscosity may result in1
the incorrect water depth. However, the eddy viscosity is indeed a function of the flow field, not a
fluid property. As the turbulent model has not been embedded in the proposed model at the present3
stage, an estimation of eddy viscosities is still required. The Elder’s relation [14] between water
depth, shear velocity, and eddy viscosity, =Hu∗, is frequently used in practice. Following the5
Elder’s relation, the determination of  was derived as below.
In order to find a clear and simple relation for  in Elder’s relation, uniform turbulent intensity7
(i.e. uniform eddy viscosity) along the depth is assumed and will lead to parabolic distribution of
horizontal velocities in the vertical direction. Consider 3D Navier–Stokes equation in the mean9

5. MODEL VERIFICATION1
5.1. Wind-induced flow
Wind-induced flow in a closed basin in which wind shear acting on the water surface results in a3
drift current in the direction it blows and a bottom return flow in the opposite direction is chosen
to verify the model’s accuracy and applicability. The analytical solution for steady laminar flow5
under no-slip condition, given by Heaps [16], for constant vertical eddy viscosity is
u(z)=

H
(43)7
where u(z) is the velocity at any depth z; H the water depth; v the vertical eddy viscosity; s the
wind stress acting on the surface; and  the water density.9
This numerical experiment is carried out to simulate a steady wind-induced flow in a uniform
rectangular channel of length 400 m, width 160 m, and depth 2 m. The water initially at rest was11
subject to a uniform wind stress, increasing linearly from 0N/m2 at t =0s to 0.5N/m2 at t =10s,
and maintaining 0.5N/m2 at t>10s. The following parameters were adopted: x =20m, y =8m,13
=1000kg/m3, v =0.015m2/s.
A constant viscosity leads to a parabolic velocity profile in the case of laminar flow. Effect of15
number of layers was also carried out with four cases of 5, 10, 20, and 30 layers. Comparison of
model predictions at the middle length of the basin to the analytical solution is shown in Figure 4.17
The major improvement of predictions of velocity profile takes place between 5 and 10 layers,
and no more significant difference takes place between predictions over 20 layers. Comparison of19
the u profile at middle length using 20 layers to the analytical solution is as expected. The upper
layer currents are in the wind direction while the lower layer currents are in the opposite direction.21
It can be seen that the prediction has a slightly larger velocity. The predicted depth with zero

nism. Figures 6 and 7 show the simulated evolution of velocity profile at middle length and1
water surface setup varying with time with 20 layers, respectively. From Figure 6 it is obvious
that the shear-induced surface flow in the beginning and the pressure-induced reverse flow at3
middle length were successfully predicted by the proposed model. These simulation results
include surface setup and pressure-induced circulation, two significant components of the physical5
mechanism.
5.2. Effect of viscosity distribution on wind-induced flow7
Owing to the distribution of vertical eddy viscosities existing in natural flows not being uniform,
three more types of viscosity distribution were considered to further investigate the capability9
of the proposed quadratic shape function for solving free-surface flows. The parabolic law of
eddy viscosity distribution is the most frequently assumed type in natural flows [15]. It has the11
maximum viscosity at middle depth and the minimum near the surface and the bottom. Figure 8
shows the simulated velocity profile with parabolic viscosity distribution compared to the one with13
uniform viscosity. The larger velocity gradient is found near both surface and bottom due to its
smaller viscosity. Contrarily, the smaller velocity gradient is found at middle depth due to its larger15
viscosity. The simulated profile behaves in a well-consistent tendency with its physical mechanism.
To further examine the flexibility of the auxiliary shape function, the trapezoidal distribution of17
viscosity was also conducted. The comparison of the velocity profiles due to change of the viscosity
distribution is shown in Figure 9. For the case of trapezoidal type I with increased viscosity from19
top to bottom, the simulated velocity profile is well adapted as its gradient decreases from top to
bottom by the quadratic shape function. By preserving the condition of zero net flow, the point21
of zero is risen a little compared with the uniform law. Figure 9 also shows that the quadratic
shape function can also adapt the velocity profile to the trapezoidal type II of viscosity distribution23
as well.

5.3. Examination of proposed eddy viscosity relation1
Because there is no net flow in the wind-induced flow in a closed basin, the non-uniformity of
viscosity distribution does not affect the mean water depth but the velocity profile. As far as 1D3
or plane 2D is concerned, the normal depth is well known as a function of flow discharge and
roughness in natural rivers. However, it is not sufficient in the 3D free-surface flow computations5
because the water depth and velocity profile are also affected by the eddy viscosity. The following
case is designed hypothetically to investigate the effect of viscosity variation on channel flow.7
A steady flow is carried in a uniform rectangular channel with length 5000 m, width 100 m,
slope 0.0005, Manning’s roughness n of 0.035, and discharge of 3.987 cm per unit width. The9
normal depth determined by Manning’s equation is 3.0 m. The slip condition was used at the side
walls but no-slip condition at the channel bed. The water body was divided into four layers of11
equal thickness. The following parameters were specified: x =500m, y =10m, =1000kg/m3.
Upstream, the lateral and vertical velocities v and w were set as zero, and the longitudinal13
velocity u was equal to the inflow discharge divided by the instantaneous flow area. Downstream,
zero longitudinal velocities gradient u/x =0, v/x =0 were applied. Three types of viscosity15
variation distribution employed as shown in Figure 10 and the coefficient  in Elder’s relation can
be expressed as follows:17

previously in this study.  is estimated to be about 0.0304 by Equation (42), and the corresponding
eddy viscosity is about 0.011m2/s.3
This numerical experiment with same conditions as the previous case is carried out to verify
the relation between flow depth and Manning’s roughness n. Three different values 0.03, 0.035,5
and 0.04 of Manning’s roughness n were considered in the numerical experiments. Table I shows
the comparison of computed water depths with those calculated by Manning’s equation. Both the7
water depth and velocity variation obviously demonstrate the response of the change of Manning’s
roughness n. The normal depths are 2.74, 3.0, and 3.25 m for n =0.03, 0.035, and 0.04, respectively.9
Computed water depths are a slightly larger than those from Manning’s equation. Comparison of
the water depths under different n values is shown in Figure 12. The velocity profiles of inner11
cross section at middle length for various Manning’s n are also compared in Figure 13. The larger
the value of roughness considered, the larger the depth and smaller the velocity obtained in the13
simulation.
5.4. Channel flow with wind shear15
The final case demonstrated in the following is to solve the wind shear effect on the flow patterns.
All conditions were the same as the previous experiment with n =0.035 except that the wind17
shears acting on the surface are 0.0, 2.0, and 5.0N/m2 directing to the upstream. Figure 14 shows

to wind-induced setup. The velocity profiles were also compared in Figure 15 under different
values of wind shears.3
6. CONCLUSION
There were a few 3D free-surface flow models developed in the past decades but least applied5
to field problem due to its heavy computational time consumptions. A novel interface continuity-
based approach proposed in this study makes the layer approach applicable in the shallow water7
free-surface flow computation. Use of a quadratic shape function guarantees that there is no discon-
tinuity situation taking place between two adjacent layers further. The modeling procedure adopted9
provides a simple and robust method for simulating 3D free-surface shallow water flows. The
verification performed in the case of wind-induced flow in a closed rectangular basin by comparing11
with the analytical solution shows a reasonable agreement in the simulated steady-state profiles.
The evolution of water surface slope and the velocity profiles at the middle length of the basin13
were examined to investigate whether the model responding to the wind shear is consistent with
the physical nature. Alternate shapes of velocity profile formed by their correspondent distribution15
of vertical viscosity also show the flexibility of the proposed approach either in wind-induced
flows or in channel flows. The variations of velocity profile due to change of viscosity distribution17
and near bed velocity are also investigated. Further, a simplified relation between discharge, water
depth, and eddy viscosity is derived as the closure of the governing equations. The proposed model19
