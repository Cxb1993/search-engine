與燃燒反應的系統基本上也成立。目前應用
的渦輪機典型的進口溫度已高達 1900K
【1】，遠超過葉片材料可承受的溫度，這使
得渦輪機前幾級動葉片及靜葉片(或導向葉
片)暴露的環境更嚴酷，也必須要有比以往
更可靠的冷卻設計以保護葉片。薄膜冷卻
(或簡稱膜冷卻)(film cooling)是保護氣輪機
葉片的一項重要冷卻技術。適當的膜冷卻可
提供一層冷空氣薄膜，將葉片與熱環境隔離
而達到保護葉片的效果。提供膜冷卻之方法
乃是從適當設計的葉片壁面與端壁(endwall)
壁面膜冷卻孔陣列噴出冷卻流體注入沿壁
面的邊界層流【2】。當二次冷卻流剛從膜冷
卻孔噴出時，如果噴射率不會大到將邊界層
吹離，則冷卻空氣將貼著葉片表面前進，直
接把葉片與外部熱氣隔離。當冷卻空氣繼續
往下游前進而與熱氣混合時，也有減低邊界
層氣體溫度的效果，因此燃燒室出來的熱氣
加諸於葉片的熱負荷就會減低，葉片受熱應
力而發生潛變破壞的機率將會降低，葉片的
壽命得以延長。膜冷卻設計良好的時候，葉
片內部冷卻的需求也相對降低。而當膜冷卻
失效時，內部冷卻之負荷加重，葉片溫度分
佈更不均勻，熱應力加強，葉片潛變破壞的
機率就會提昇。 
 
二、文獻探討 
由於膜冷卻對氣輪機之重要性，對這方
面的研究已有很多文章發表。Wanda Jiang 
and Han【3】利用 5 個葉片的線性串級，以
實驗方法研究膜冷卻孔之孔列位置對於葉
片膜冷卻有效性之影響。膜冷卻流體則採用
空氣或二氧化碳氣體以模擬溫度場造成的
密度比。Cho and Goldstein【4,5】利用奈揮
發的質傳技術，探討圓形膜冷卻孔裡面與前
後平面之熱傳情形。為了得到熱傳係數分佈
與膜冷卻有效性之分佈，他們用純空氣與飽
和奈蒸氣當二次流冷卻流體進行實驗，分別
採集兩組數據作化約。Vedula and Metzger
【6】則提出一個可以同時得到熱傳係數分
佈與膜冷卻有效性分佈的方法。此方法可以
利用兩種液晶在同一暫態實驗或一種液晶
在兩個相似實驗取得數據後做同時化約。
Metzger et al【7】實驗結果證實，一個有膜
冷卻且無絕熱的表面，其熱傳係數與膜冷卻
有效性成一線性關係，Dittmar et al【8】利
用該原裡做有複合角膜冷卻孔的實驗數據
化約的依據。由於一種液晶用於兩次實驗或
一次實驗用兩種液晶以求得熱傳係數與有
效性的方法，再數學求解時容易形成
ill-posed 問題，Chambers et al【9】提出利
用三個實驗的暫態液晶熱傳實驗技術，雖然
他們用於有橫向流的衝擊冷卻實驗作數據
化約，相同的學理應該也可以用在膜冷卻實
驗。Goldstein and Chen【10,11】對於近端壁
區域之膜冷卻有詳細的研究。他們使用單排
【10】與雙排【11】膜冷卻孔，改變吹氣率
與密度比，以及使用質傳方法進行實驗。結
果顯示，由於端壁的存在造成的三維流場，
與二維流區域比較，壓力面的膜冷卻有效性
僅有微小的影響，但是在吸力面有一個三角
型區域，在那裡膜冷卻幾乎是完全失效的。
由流動觀察顯示，該三角型區域大致相當於
通道渦漩沿著吸力面掃過的區域。類似的結
論也由 Takeishi et al.【12】提出。而後者【12】
的實驗則採用一完整環狀的靜葉片串級。
Wilfert and Fottner【13】則發現在吸力面上
膜冷卻流之吹氣率會強烈影響馬蹄形渦漩
之位置，此乃因為不同的吹氣率改變了膜冷

用暫態液晶熱像法研究紊流對葉片之膜冷

同吹氣率、密度比情況下的影響，經由實驗
結果發現紊流會造成熱傳係數的增加並減
少膜冷卻有效性。另外，Hale et al.【1】則
利用穩態液晶熱相法研究平板上膜冷卻有
效性的分佈，在他們的研究中雖然穩態方法
具有較高的準確性但是太靠近孔處的資料
亦無法準確的得到。Dittmar et al.【8】使用

vane so that boundary layer developed along a smooth endwall. 
In such a case, the flow to the vane has a smooth endwall 
condition.  In reality, however, the connection between the 
combustion chamber and the first stage guide vanes is often 
made by a transition duct which is fabricated separately and 
then engaged to the vane casing. Although the initial assembly 
normally provides nearly smooth endwall or an endwall with a 
backward-facing step, due to different thermal expansion of the 
parts, a forward-facing step at the endwall might also occur 
during operation. An entrance step at endwall will obviously 
affect the boundary layer development along the endwall and 
make the flow pattern in the passage even more complicated  
[7]. Wu et al. [8, 9] show that a forward-facing entrance causes 
an increase in heat transfer coefficient while a decrease in film 
cooling effectiveness at the endwall near the step. The passage 
vortex also climbs up the suction surface at an increased angle. 
To optimize the film cooling configuration for the endwall 
is not an easy task because of the above-mentioned complexity 
of the three-dimensional flow field and many other influential 
parameters. Many of the previous researches have focused on 
the use of shaped holes and holes with various compound 
angles, e.g. [10 – 15] to name just a few of them. Quite a few 
researchers have used the liquid crystal technique in their 
measurement, e.g. [11, 13, 14]. Much more information 
regarding endwall research can be seen in an excellent review 
by Simon and Piggush [16]. Ahn et al. [17] used cross injection 
into a straight main flow on a flat plate. The crossing angle for 
each pair of holes, arranged in two rows, is 90 degrees and the 
injection angle is 35 degrees. Their focus is on the boundary 
layer temperature distribution and the film effectiveness 
comparison among different hole arrangements. The present 
study differs in that it seeks to understand the effect on the heat 
transfer characteristics by the interaction of the cross injection 
and the complex mainstream in a vane passage. The 
investigation also includes the effect of an entrance step for the 
mainstream. Based on momentum principle consideration, the 
cross injection in the present study has shear-induced 
secondary flow which has the same sense of rotation as that of 
the passage vortex in the main flow. The resulting heat transfer 
coefficient and film cooling effectiveness will be compared 
with that of parallel-to-streamwise injection to assess the 
performance of the cross injection technique.

TEST SECTION AND EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS 
An enlarged two-half-vane acrylic model was used in the 
experiments. The vane geometry is taken from Krishnamoorthy 
et al. [18]. The validity of using two-half-vane model for 
endwall heat transfer studies was approved by Chung and 
Simon [19]. A different idea of using a two-passage model, as 
that used by Jenkins and Bogard [20] could have been chosen, 
but it requires much higher fan power than the present wind 
tunnel facility can offer. The test model was scaled up by a 
factor of 3.46 for easier measurement. Two acrylic plates of 10 
mm thick were thermally bent to the suction surface and the 
pressure surface profiles separately. Two acrylic bars of 
semicircular cross section with 31 mm and 10 mm in diameter 
were attached to the ends of each plate to form the leading edge 
and the trailing edge, respectively, of the vane model (Fig. 1). 
Both top and lower endwalls of the test model were made of 
acrylic plates of 15 mm thick. 
The passage between the two-half vanes was used to 
simulate any flow passage in a turbine vane cascade. To 
achieve this similarity, side gaps (bleed slots) between wind 
tunnel exit and the two vane leading edges must be provided to 
avoid channel flow situation, as shown in Fig. 2. The gap sizes 
influence the saddle point, the pressure distribution, and the 
flow field in the vane passage. Therefore, suitable gap sizes

of the second row, and both rows in each group have the same 
number of holes. These holes are paired to form cross injection 
with an angle of 120 degrees. In addition, the extension of the 
centerlines of each pair of the holes has an offset of half of the 
hole diameter in the radial direction at the crossing point. The 
purpose of the design is to generate shear-induced vortices 
having the same sense of rotation as that of the passage vortex. 
Cylindrical holes of D = 2.5 mm and 30 degree injection angle 
are used in both endwalls. The corresponding groups in both 
endwall plates have the same number of holes. Therefore, both 
endwalls have same total number of coolant holes. Also, for 
equal blowing ratio, M, both endwalls have the same amount of 
total coolant. 
 
 
 
Fig. 5 Diagram of Endwall I showing the three rows of 
coolant holes with parallel injection. 
 
The main flow in the experiment is provided by a blowing 
type wind tunnel with fan power of 5.7 kW.  A high-power air 
heater following the fan has a PID feedback control for setting 
main flow temperature and heating speed.  The hot air is then 
fed into a tunnel of cross section 306 mm×306 mm.  It enters a 
settling chamber, and goes through a series of mixing grid bars 
and fine screens.  The end of the wind tunnel is a converging 
nozzle, which reduces the flow cross sectional area to 200 
mm(W)×306 mm(H) at the exit, followed by a settling section 
of 200mm-length with adjustable sidewalls.  The shape of the 
converging nozzle is designed with a sixth degree polynomial 
and its flow field simulated with Fluent software.  After 
fabrication, the velocity profile at the exit of the settling section 
is measured with a hot wire anemometer (Model HW-110) to 
be uniform over the entire exit plane. The non-uniformity of the 
velocity distribution is less than 1.5% in the mainstream.  The 
temperature distribution at the tunnel is also controlled to be 
within 1 C° in the tested endwall region. Due to the use of fine 
screens, the turbulence intensity of the main flow was 
measured to be 0.3% only. The test section was attached to the 
exit of the settling section. During the heat transfer 
 
 
 
Fig. 6 Diagram of Endwall II showing the three groups of 
double-row coolant holes with cross injection 
 
experiments, a thermocouple was installed before the inlet of 
the vane passage and in the mid-span location to measure the 
free stream temperature. 
The coolant flow was supplied by an air compressor and 
adjusted by a pressure regulator. After flowing through an air 
dryer and an oil filter, the clean air went into a flow meter 
where the coolant flow rate was measured. After that, the air is 
fed into a heater and then into a settling chamber before it was 
injected into the mainstream. The settling chamber is an acrylic 
box attached to the bottom side of the test endwall. The heater 
also has a heating rate control. The chamber was designed to 
have three inlets with independent flow rate control. Three 
thermocouples were located in the chamber to ensure even 
temperature distribution of the coolant in the chamber. 
All the thermocouples used in the study were calibrated 
using a high precision thermal well (HART SCIENTIFIC 9105) 
and a PT100 thermistor. The calibrated results ensure the 
accuracy of the temperature measurement to be within 
0.05 C± ° . On the other hand, the velocity measurement has 
uncertainty of 3.5% (95% confidence level). 
 
EXPERIMENTAL METHOD 
To calculate the heat transfer to a film-cooled surface, the 
heat transfer coefficient, h, and the adiabatic wall temperature,

Equation (1) also indicates that the definition of the heat 
transfer coefficient uses the adiabatic wall temperature as an 
appropriate reference temperature so that its definition only 
depends on fluid dynamics of the flow field but not on 
temperature boundary layer conditions. This is a three-
temperature problem since it involves the temperature of the

Fig. 8 Typical heated curves for the mainstream and the 
coolant in transient heat transfer experiment 
 
cooling experiment, the mainstream was set about ten degrees 
higher temperature than required. The endwall plate was heated 
up by the mainstream until the whole plate had temperatures 
higher than the phase change temperature of the liquid crystal. 
A steady state was established and temperature gradients exist 
in the thickness direction of the endwall plate. The mainstream 
temperature was than lower down to the required value. The 
temperature field within the endwall plate began to change 
slowly. The rate of change of the upper surface temperature is 
faster than that of the bottom surface due to its much higher 
heat transfer coefficient. When the surface thermocouples on 
both sides of the endwall plated indicated the same temperature 
(i.e. adiabatic wall condition) and the liquid crystal displayed 
clear color pattern, the image data and the temperature data 
were taken. Since the rate of change of the endwall temperature 
was slow, this process is regarded as a quasi-steady-state 
process. The distribution of the adiabatic film cooling 
effectiveness was then calculated from Eq. (2), where the 
coolant temperature 2T  was measured inside the coolant 
settling chamber and the coolant density was also calculated at 
this condition. In this study, the blowing ratios M = 0.5, 1.0, 
and 2.0 were tested. The coolant to mainstream density ratio 
was about 1.10. The uncertainty of the film cooling 
effectiveness from this experimental process was calculated to 
be within 6.8% according to the procedure of [22]. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Heat Transfer Coefficient 
Typical distributions of the local Nusselt number for the 
blowing ratio of M = 2 and with smooth endwall condition are 
shown in Fig. 9 for Endwall I and in Fig. 10 for Endwall II. 
The X and Y coordinates are in pixels. From a calibration, each 
pixel in all the CCD views is equivalent to 0.322 mm in both

directions. For both configurations, film injection causes high 
heat transfer areas, in addition to the small areas around the 
leading edge which are caused by horseshoe vortices. Due to 
high injection momentum in the direction normal to the wall, 
the coolant from the first-row holes of Endwall I has separation 
and reattachment phenomena (Fig. 9a). The near-hole 
separation was found to occur by Harrington et al. [24] even at 
the blowing ration of 0.65. The separation phenomena 
disappear when the cross injection was employed (Fig. 10a), 
indicating better attachment of the coolant to the surface. This 
is benefited from both the orientation angle of the holes and the 
effect of the induced vortex by cross injection with Endwall II 
configuration. 
The local Nusselt number is averaged across the vane 
passage at any axial location for easier comparison. The 
averaged results are shown in Fig. 11 for Endwall I and Fig. 12 
for Endwall II, for smooth and stepped inlet conditions. The 
axial position in these figures is normalized by the axial chord 
length, aC , of the vane. Figure 11 shows that a stepped

following mainly for the purpose of comparison of cooling 
performance between these two configurations. Figure 15 
shows a comparison of cooling performance between Endwall I 
and Endwall II configurations for blowing ratio M = 0.5 for 
smooth and non-smooth inlet conditions. Similar comparisons 
are made at blowing rations M = 1.0 and M = 2.0 in Figs. 16 
and 17. 
The comparison in Fig. 15 for low blowing ratio shows 
that the cross injection is more advantageous than the parallel

injection for the first half passage area and the region covered 
by the cross injection stream (peak area). The advantages are 
more remarkable for smooth endwall and the endwall with a 
forward-facing entrance step than for the endwall with a 
backward-facing step. This is because multiple vortex systems 
generate right after a backward-facing step which persist 
throughout the whole vane passage. In this case, the shear-
induced vortex from the cross injection of the coolant does not 
necessarily have the same sense of rotation as the secondary 
flow of the mainstream at all locations inside the vane passage. 
Although a forward-facing step also causes multiple vortices, 
they quickly merge to become a single passage vortex as in the 
smooth endwall case [7]. Therefore, the cross injection scheme 
for the case with a forward-facing step performs similarly as 
for the case with smooth endwall.

Between the second row and the third row, there is a 
region where cross injection has lower film effectiveness than 
parallel injection. This is because part of the coolant has 
reached the suction wall and climbs up the surface. That part of 
coolant has lost its direct influence on the endwall. The 
decrease of the average film effectiveness in front of the second 
group of holes for Endwall II seems to be caused by an induced 
larger size of the suction leg horseshoe vortex around the
