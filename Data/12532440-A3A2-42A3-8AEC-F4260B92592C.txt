2conversion efficiency is low. Usually, the pump laser diodes dominate the overall cost
for the high power fiber laser system. Higher pump conversion efficiency reduces the
number of pump laser diodes, thus reducing the cost of the fiber laser system.
To date, quantum conversion efficiency (i.e., the rate with respect to pump power
converted to laser power in 1.06 μm band) of fiber lasers–such as high-power
ytterbium doped fiber laser (YDFL) –has been demonstrated to approach 90%. The
corresponding lasing power of YDFL at 1.09μm has achieved tens of thousands watts
[11]. On the other hand, erbium-doped fiber or erbium/ytterbium co-doped fiber was
used as the gain medium of the cladding pumped fiber laser to produce lasing in the
1.55 μm band. However, most of such fiber lasers exhibit only 30~40% pump
conversion efficiency at 1.55μm and some can reach 50% [12].
High-power and high-efficiency fiber laser operations, on the other hand, may be
achieved by employing an MOPA (master oscillator and power amplifier)
configuration [12-16]. The MOPA structure exploits a linear fiber cavity to produce a
low-power fiber laser and a power amplifier cascaded at the output of the low-power
laser for boosting the lasing power. Compared to 30~40% pump conversion efficiency
for most erbium-doped fiber lasers without power amplifiers, the erbium-doped fiber
based MOPA laser structure effectively raises pump conversion efficiency to ~50% at
the 1.55 μm band [12,13,17,18]. Additionally, double-clad ytterbium based MOPA
laser can convert 80% pump power to 500 watts lasing power at the 1.06 μm band
[16].
It is well known that a properly designed erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)
can efficiently provide a high gain for a 1.55μm band signal. Thus, it can be expected
that the MOPA fiber laser can be made very efficient by smartly managing the pump
powers for the laser cavity stage and the booster amplifier stage while keeping the
total pump power at a prescribed level. In this paper, we propose a design procedure
4Fig.1) of the laser cavity may be so small that the booster amplifier operates in the
unsaturated region resulting in a low optical output power. On the other hand, if more
pump power is used for the fiber laser cavity to generate a larger power at the output
of the laser cavity, the output power of the booster amplifier may still not be large
because the pump power for the booster amplifier may become insufficient to obtain
large enough gain. In this sense, there exists an optimal splitting ratio for the pump
power.
The fiber Bragg grating, FBG, has the Bragg wavelength at 1565.8 nm and a
reflectivity of about 95%. The erbium-doped fiber used here has a low erbium ion
concentration corresponding to an absorption coefficient of 6 dB/m at 1530 nm and 4
dB/m at 980 nm.
(B) Procedure for Optimization
To find the maximum pump conversion efficiency, it is required to vary the
splitting ratio of FC2 as well as the lengths of EDF1 and EDF2. To find the required
splitting ratio, we use two independent 1480 nm sources to pump EDF1 and EDF2,
respectively, with each pump source power varied while keeping the total pump
power at a prescribed level, say 300 mW. For each set of pump powers, we study the
master laser and the booster amplifier separately. Optimization of the pump
conversion efficiency (PCF) for a fixed total pump power follows the steps below. Set
a pump power splitting ratio (For example, choose 8mW/292 mW. Here 292 mW is
for the booster amplifier and 8 mW is for the master laser. )
(1) Study the performance of the master laser first. Vary the length of the EDF in the
laser cavity to find the dependence of the laser output power on the EDF length.
(See Fig.2(a) for the case of 8 mW pump power. The maximum output power,
2.63 dBm, occurs at an EDF length of 8.3 m. )
(2) Study the performance of the booster amplifier. Use a power-tunable laser (at a
6Both EDF1 and EDF2 are low-concentration erbium/germanium-alumina
co-doped fibers. By fixing the total pump power at 300 mW, the optimal pump power
splitting ratio is found to be 8 mW/292 mW (with 8 mW delivered to EDF1 and 292
mW to EDF2). It should be noted at this moment that 300 mW is a summative power
at the input ends of EDF1 and EDF2. An optical power of 274.2 mW, corresponding
to a pump conversion efficiency of 91.4% (or a quantum conversion efficiency of
96.6%, which is directly obtained as 91.4% multiplied by 1565.8/1480) at the output
end of our erbium-doped fiber MOPA laser is achieved. The pump conversion
efficiencies of the fiber laser cavity and the booster amplifier are 23% and 94%,
respectively. The optimal lengths of EDF1 and EDF2 are 8.3 and 28.1 m, respectively.
Compared with the erbium-doped fiber lasers reported in the 1.55 μm band to date,
our erbium-doped fiber MOPA laser has the highest pump conversion efficiency
(91%), as the total pump power is properly managed.
To compare the proposed 274.2 mW MOPA laser with a traditional EDF laser
cavity (i.e., a non-MOPA laser), we use 300 mW to pump the laser cavity of Fig.1
(without the booster amplifier). Figure 3 shows the output power as a function of the
length of EDF1 for various coupling ratios of FC1 to demonstrate the optimization of
EDF length. Filled circles, triangles and squares represent the experimental results for
coupling ratios of 1/99, 10/90 and 50/50, respectively. Here a ratio of x/y denotes that
y% input power of a fiber coupler is delivered to port A. The maximum power that
can be generated from a fiber laser cavity is only 219 mW (with the length of EDF
being ~20 m ) corresponding to a pump conversion efficiency of 73%, while the
optimized MOPA laser can provide 274.2 mW, an enhancement of over 25% with
respect to the non-MOPA laser.
The output power and the corresponding pump conversion efficiency of the
optimized MOPA laser as a function of total pump power are shown in Fig. 4. The
