非線性地震地層反應分析：標準分析步驟之建立與垂直陣列之驗證 
Nonlinear Seismic Ground Response Analysis: Benchmarking and Verification using 
Vertical Arrays 
INTRODUCTION 
In the field of geotechnical earthquake engineering, there are two ways to predict ground 
motions: (1) use of Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs); (2) theoretical ground 
response analyses. GMPEs are derived empirically through regression on a database of strong 
motion. GMPEs can be used to estimate the probabilistic distribution (in terms of median and 
standard deviation) of an intensity measure, such as peak ground acceleration, based on 
magnitude, site-source distance, site condition etc.. For theoretical ground response analyses, 
numerical modeling of wave propagation is performed. The analysis would encompass a soil 
domain of limited dimension and consider more detailed soil profile than GMPEs (e.g. soil 
layer properties, constitutive model). Most theoretical methods assume that shear wave 
propagates vertically and upward from the bottom bedrock at the site. Soil material models in 
ground response analysis can be equivalent-linear and nonlinear. 
In engineering practice, one-dimensional ground response analyses are often 
performed using equivalent-linear procedures, which require few, generally well-known 
parameters. Nonlinear analyses have the potential to more accurately simulate soil behavior, 
but their implementation in practice has been limited because of poorly documented and 
unclear parameter selection and code usage protocols. Moreover, the benefits of nonlinear 
modeling relative to equivalent-linear modeling are not well-understood. In a previous 
research performed by this principal investigator (Kwok et al, 2007; Stewart and Kwok, 
2008), the following preliminary code usage/parameter selection protocols for nonlinear 
ground response analyses were proposed: (1) when input motions are from ground surface 
recordings, the full outcropping motion should be used without converting to a “within” 
condition; (2) Rayleigh viscous damping should be specified using at least two matching 
frequencies with a target level equal to the small strain soil damping; (3) the “target” soil 
backbone curves used in analysis can be parameterized to capture either the soil’s dynamic 
shear strength when large-strain soil response is expected (strains approaching 1%), relatively 
small-strain response (i.e.,  < 0.3%) as inferred from cyclic laboratory tests, or a hybrid of 
the two; (4) soil constitutive models used in nonlinear codes inevitably represent a 
compromise between the fitting of the shapes of target backbone and target hysteretic 
damping curves; two alternatives for model parameterization (i.e., optimizing only the fitting 
of target backbone curve, or optimizing both the fitting of target backbone and damping 
curves) should be considered. One-dimensional nonlinear ground response analyses based on 
aforementioned parameter selection and code usage protocols were previously performed for 
four vertical arrays by Stewart and Kwok (2008). When the predictions were compared to 
data, site amplification was under-predicted at high frequencies and over-predicted at the 
elastic site period for some of the vertical arrays.

model was constructed. The components of this geotechnical model include layering, shear 
wave velocity profile, basic soil properties such as unit weight, and dynamic soil properties in 
terms of modulus reduction and damping curves. Since laboratory testing was not performed 
at the selected sites, soil properties for each layer were deduced from published literature (e.g 
Darendeli, 2001) for similar soil type. Figures 1 and 2 show the shear-wave velocity model 
and dynamic soil material curves used for the Garney Valley vertical array in Southern 
California. 
Ground response analyses were performed for the selected vertical array sites 
(different from those used by Stewart and Kwok, 2008) using SHAKE2000, DEEPSOIL and 
OpenSees. In this research, total stress analyses were performed and hence water pressure 
generation, dissipation and redistribution were not considered. Earthquake recordings at 
downhole locations were specified as input (control) motions. At the bottom of the soil 
column, a rigid boundary was imposed because the input motion was a within motion (Kwok 
et al., 2007). As discussed in previous paragraph, the dynamic material curves were based on 
published literature for similar soil types. In this research, we considered these curves as the 
“target” material curves which were directly specified in equivalent-linear analysis. However, 
since soil constitutive models (in terms of mathematical functions) are used in nonlinear 
ground response analyses, “fitted” curves were used instead. In this research, there were two 
types of fitted curves: (1) unloading/reloading of material is based on Masing (1926) rule; (2) 
unloading/reloading of material is based on Phillips and Hashash (2009). Fitted curves of the 
first type are used in both DEEPSOIL and OpenSees while the second type is used in 
DEEPSOIL only. Figure 2 shows the dynamic material curves for selected layers of Garney 
Valley vertical array. Lastly, the full Rayleigh viscous damping is used in nonlinear analyses.  
RESULTS   
Nonlinear ground response analyses were performed for the selected vertical arrays and 
earthquake events. The predicted surface response spectra were compared to the recorded 
data. Figures 3 and 4 show the results for Garney Valley and TTRH02 KikNet vertical arrays 
respectively. (Note that “Equivalent Linear”, “Nonlinear – Masing” and “Nonlinear – Non-
Masing” represent analyses performed in DEEPSOIL) In general, the predictions for Garner 
Valley are very close to the recordings while the ground response analyses tend to under-
predict the response for TTRH02 KikNet vertical array. Moreover, material curves with 
different unloading/reloading rules seem to give very similar predictions. This is because the 
shear-strains experienced by the soils are not very large (maximum is about 0.3%) for the 
earthquake events considered in this research study and the curves from both 
unloading/reloading rules are essentially the same (see Figure 2).  In addition, the surface 
response spectra predicted by both equivalent-linear analyses and nonlinear analyses have 
very similar shape although the spectral values at short periods (for several earthquake events) 
are higher for equivalent-linear analyses. This can be because equivalent-linear analysis uses 
an average (single) damping value throughout the analysis and this value is larger than what 
is used in nonlinear analysis for majority of the analysis time (i.e. damping value varies with 
time in nonlinear analysis). Lastly, compared to other nonlinear analysis results, OpenSees 
5 
 
future, we should re-visit the two analyses and identify the differences in the predictions. On 
the other hand, strong shaking data may be available from centrifuge or shaking table tests. 
However, if we want to see the performance of equivalent-linear analysis, we will need to 
ensure that the data set we choose is not affected by the boundary conditions of the 
experiments. 
Equivalent-linear ground response analyses are widely used in practice because 
parameter selection and code implementation are very simple. However, if the predicted 
shear strain is large (>0.5%), one should start questioning the results of equivalent-linear 
analysis. Although there are more required input parameters and implementation procedure is 
more complex, this research shows that it is possible to run nonlinear ground response 
analyses in a systematic way. Hence, engineers should be encouraged to perform this type of 
analysis in parallel to equivalent-linear analysis because nonlinear analysis utilizes a more 
accurate representation of soil behavior.

freedom lumped mass system or a continuum discretized into elements with distributed mass with appropriate 
boundary conditions. Soil material models employed range from relatively simple cyclic stress-strain 
relationships (DEEPSOIL, D-MOD_2 and TESS) to advanced plasticity models (OpenSees and SUMDES). 
 
Material Properties 
 
The four vertical array sites considered in this study include KGWH02 (from the Japanese Kiknet network of 
strong motion stations), Lotung (Taiwan), Turkey Flat and La Cienega (both of them are in California of the 
United States.) The available site data include velocity logs, boring logs and site-specific material curves 
(except the Kiknet site).  
 
Shear Wave Velocity Profile 
 
The median velocity profiles are estimated based on available geophysical measurements and used as the 
baseline geotechnical model. Variability in the velocity profiles is estimated either from data (if multiple 
measurements at the same site are available) or based on the empirical model of Toro (1997). The Toro model 
is based on 176 velocity profiles from the Savannah River site, and is a statistical model that can be used to 
estimate the standard deviation and correlation in velocity profiles for both generic (broad geographic region) 
and site-specific conditions. In current analyses, the alternative velocity profiles are obtained by adding and 
subtracting to the baseline profile 3  times the depth-dependent site-specific standard deviation. The 3  
factor is used because the theoretical optimal three-point representation of a normal distribution involves 
sampling the distribution at the mean () and  3 , and then providing the samples with weights of 2/3 
and 1/6 (twice). Those sample points and weights preserve the first (mean), second (variance), and fourth 
central moments of the underlying distribution (Rosenblueth, 1975; Ching et al., 2006). 
 
Modulus Reduction and Damping Curves 
 
The modulus reduction and damping curves are used to model the nonlinear soil behavior for different depth 
ranges. The median (baseline) curves used in current analyses are based on either material-specific laboratory 
testing, inference of in-situ material property from vertical array data or Darendeli (2001) statistical model. 
Variability in material curves is considered by adding and subtracting to the baseline curves 3  times the 
strain-dependent standard deviation. This standard deviation is taken either from Darendeli (2001) or 
estimated from in-situ data.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Ground response analyses are performed for the vertical array sites using various nonlinear ground response 
analysis codes with both baseline (median) and alternative (taking into account the variability in material 
properties) geotechnical models. 
 
To evaluate the model-to-model variability for the ground surface results for period T, the median estimate 
 )(ln TSa  is first evaluated from the five nonlinear model predictions. Model variability, m, is then calculated 
from the variance as follows:

where N = number of predictions (five).  
 
The response variability due to material uncertainty is assessed using DEEPSOIL predictions only. To 
calculate the standard deviation due to velocity, ground motions are predicted based on two non-baseline 
velocity profiles (mean + 3  standard deviation velocities and mean - 3  standard deviation velocities). 
The standard deviation of the ground motions due to the variability in velocity (denoted v) is estimated 
according to the FOSM, method (Baker and Cornell, 2003; Melchers, 1999), as follows:

From the website of the Center for Engineering Strong Motion Data (www.strongmotioncenter.org), shear 
wave and pressure wave velocity profiles for this geotechnical array are available (see right frame of Figure 1). 
In addition, the geology of this site is classified as deep alluvium. Table 1 lists the strong motion data recorded 
at Eureka Geotechnical Array. 
 
GROUND RESPONSE ANALYSIS 
 
Analysis Type 
Frequency-domain equivalent-linear analysis was originally proposed by Seed and Idriss (1969). To 
estimate the ground motion at any location of a soil column (given a control motion), transfer functions are 
calculated. Equivalent-linear analyses model the shear modulus and damping using a linear spring and a 
dashpot respectively. An iterative procedure is carried out to search for the appropriate stiffness and damping 
properties that are, on average, compatible with the ground motion level.   
Time-domain nonlinear analysis solves the dynamic equation of motion. Unlike equivalent-linear analysis, 
the soil properties at each time step vary and the dynamic soil behavior is characterized using a soil 
constitutive model. 
In this study, both frequency-domain equivalent linear (using SHAKE2000, by Ordonez 2011) and 
time-domain nonlinear (nonlinear option in DEEPSOIL by Hashash, 2009; OpenSees by McKenna, F. and 
G.L. Fenves (2001).) analyses were performed. 
 
Geotechnical Model 
The soil column is 136m in height. Since the only site information available for the Eureka Geotechnical 
Array is the shear wave velocity profile (indicated in the right frame Figure 1) and the site geology (alluvium), 
the statistical model by Darendeli (2001) is used to estimate the target modulus reduction and damping curves 
at different depths. These material curves can readily be used in frequency-domain equivalent linear analyses 
(as the modulus and damping values used in analyses are interpolated between two shear strain ordinates). 
However, in nonlinear analyses, soil behavior is described by a specific soil constitutive model which controls 
the stress-strain relationship during initial loading (called the “backbone” curve), subsequent unloading and 
reloading. It should be mentioned that Masing’s (1926) rules (and the corresponding mathematical 
formulation) is often used in nonlinear analysis to describe the unloading and reloading behavior of soil. 
However, since Masing’s rules tend to overestimate damping at large strain, non-Masing formulation is also 
available in some nonlinear codes. Also, since the constitutive models may not exactly reproduce the target 
material curves (e.g. from Darendeli or cyclic testing), optimization is needed when determining the 
parameters for the constitutive models. Figure 2 shows the target curves (used in equivalent-linear analyses) 
as well as the “fitted” curves (used in nonlinear analyses) for the first layer of the soil column. The horizontal 
motions recorded at the depth of 136m (sensors 13and 15) during the Ferndale 09 Jan 2010 earthquake are 
used as the input motions and specified at the bottom of the soil column. The peak ground acceleration of the 
input motion is about 0.06g.  
 
Prediction Results and Comparison to Recordings 
Figure 3 shows both the recorded and predicted surface response spectra for the Ferndale 09 Jan 2010 
event. From the comparison, there doesn’t seem to have a trend to suggest whether the performance of 
nonlinear analysis is better than that of equivalent-linear analysis (or vice versa). Also, for a given analysis 
type, there is neither systematic over-prediction nor under-prediction. In general, the theoretical simulations 
seem to perform reasonably well in terms of capturing the shape of the surface response spectra and the 
predicted level of shaking is also comparable to the recorded data (with the exception of the spectral ordinate 
at period of about 2 seconds for the NS component). Moreover, the choice of unloading and reloading rules 
(Masing vs non-Masing) does not seem to have huge impact on the prediction results. 
 
DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
In this paper, we seek to evaluate whether it is possible to obtain a reasonable estimate of site response by 
theoretical modeling if only basic geotechnical data are available. From the ground response analyses 
performed for the Eureka Geotechnical Array, the prediction seems to be similar to the recorded data, in terms 
of shape and amplitude. We have also performed analyses for other vertical array sites such as the Kiknet sites 
from Japan (for brevity, results are not shown in this paper). Similar to the Eureka Array, the basic 
geotechnical data available for those sites include shear wave velocity profiles and simple soil description 
(from boring logs). However, the prediction results for the Kiknet sites are not as desirable. The shape and 
magnitude are very different from the recorded data, which suggests that the velocity model used in our 
ground response analyses may not be correct or the fundamental physics of the theoretical models are not 
appropriate for the sites (which is possible if the waves do not vertically propagate or the site geometry has 
multi-directional effects on the ground motions).One should note that these factors may never be realized in
