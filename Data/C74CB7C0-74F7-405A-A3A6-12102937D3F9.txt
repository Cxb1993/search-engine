Abstract 
The characterization of water-soluble species of dry deposition flux, total suspended 
particulates (TSPs), fine particles (particle matter with aerodynamic diameters <2.5μm (PM2.5)), 
coarse particles (particle matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5–10μm (PM2.5-10)), and dry 
deposition velocity were studied at Taichung Airport sampling sites in central Taiwan between Sept. 
and Dec. 2004. The average TSP concentrations at Taichung airport were about 0.8 times that of the 
harbor sampling site in central Taiwan. Additionally, the average dry deposition velocities (for 
TSPs) for metallic elements Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Mg were 1.54±0.44, 0.86±0.31, 0.77±0.32, 
0.62±0.24, 1.21±0.42, 0.82±0.14 and 1.64±0.26 (cm sec-1), respectively, at the airport sampling site. 
Furthermore, metallic element concentrations in fine and coarse particulate matter in air samples 
were also analyzed. The average ratios of fine to coarse for metallic elements Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, 
Cr and Mg were 5.04±1.87, 1.80±0.60, 1.80±0.76, 2.89±0.72, 1.75±0.36, 1.58±0.39 and 2.33±1.87, 
respectively. The results indicated that the metallic elements in the fine particulate matter accounted 
for the majority of particulates at the Taichung airport sampling site.

1. Introduction 
In Taiwan, suspended particle pollution has become severe problem over the last few years 
(Lee et al., 2001). Particulate air pollution is considered harmful to human health (Pedersen et al., 
1999).  
Taichung, the largest city in the central Taiwan, is surrounded by the Taichung Thermal Power 
Plant (TTPP) and Guan Lian Industrial park (GLIP). Summer is associated with strong winds, high 
humidity and heavy rainfall, all of which markedly decrease the level of ambient pollutants. 
Conversely, winter is associated with low wind speed and precipitation, thereby increasing the 
potential for air pollution in Taichung. Rapid development and a dense population have worsened 
Teaching’s air pollution. The coastal marine atmosphere adjacent to large urban and industrial 
centers can be strongly influenced by pollution emissions, affecting a high pollutant loading in 
ambient air (Chester et al., 1994; Baker et al., 1997; Eisenreich et al., 1997; Holsen et al., 1997; 
Ondov et al., 1997). Sediments in coastal environments have central roles in nutrient and metal 
cycles. (Zago et al., 2001). There are typically strong vertical and horizontal gradients of gaseous 
and particulate matter pollutants that are principally due to emission sources, and rapid mixing and 
dilution of street level emissions (Väkeva et al., 1999). 
The actual compounds identified in a given ambient sample have a strong correlation with the 
chemical composition of source emissions. Aerosols typically from five principal sources: (1) 
continental dust; (2) sea spray; (3) combustion processes; (4) chemical reactions; and, (5) industrial 
processes involving gaseous components. Volcanic activity also produces particulate matter in all 
size ranges. The mass concentrations of suspended particulate matter in air are called total 
suspended particulates (TSP). Particles <10μm (0.01mm) in aerodynamic diameter are called 
respirable particulate matter or PM10 (PM= particulate matter), whereas PM2.5 denotes fine 
particulate matter <2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter. (Ohlström et al., 2000).  Both PM10 and 
PM2.5 measurements are included in US ambient air quality standards (US-Environmental 
Protection Agency, 1987 for PM10; 1996 for PM2.5). Particulate matter size and shape are crucial 
factors controlling the extent to which airborne particulate matter penetrates the human respiratory 
tract. Metallic elements in coarse particulate matter (PM2.5–10) deposited in the upper respiratory 
tract, whereas fine particulate matter (PM2.5) move deep into the lungs, and the finest particles reach 
the alveolar region (Voutsa et al., 2002).  
Dry deposition velocity strongly depends on particular variables; such as particulate matter 
size, meteorological and atmospheric stability, relative humidity, wind speed and characteristics of 
the deposition surface (Caffrey et al., 1998). Various areas of research have examined dry 
deposition of air pollutants. And it has long been known that airborne particles are associated with 
adverse effects on amenity via a reduction in visibility and soiling of buildings. Associations 
between suspended particulate matter and lung function parameters, respiratory symptoms and 
mortality have been demonstrated (Dockery et al., 1993). Investigations have indicated that, 
depending on particle size, particles are deposited in different regions of the human respiratory 
system—fine particles penetrate in deepest in to lung passages. Lung deposition peaks at 20% for 
3μm particles and 60% for 0.03μm particles (Swift et al., 1982). Epidemiological studies conducted 
in several countries demonstrated consistent associations between exposure to ambient particulate 
 3
the films were baked in an oven at 60℃ for 2 hr to remove volatile substances, and then placed in 
an drying chamber at humidity 50±5% and temperature 25±5℃ for at least 24 hr before weighing. 
The PS-1 (GPS1 PUF Sampler, General Metal Work) sampler is a complete air sampling 
system designed to collect suspended airborne particles simultaneously at flow rate up to 280 L/min. 
The flow rate was adjusted to 200 L/min in this study. The quartz filter (diameter 10.2 cm) was 
utilized to filter suspended particles. The filters were first conditioned for 24 hr in an electric 
chamber at humidity 50±5% and temperature 25±5℃ prior to weighing. Filters were placed in a 
sealed CD box during transport and storage. 
The Model 310 Universal Air Sampler TM (UASTM) is a general-purpose air sampler for 
atmospheric aerosol sampling and mass concentration determinations, inorganic analyses. The 
sampler has an inlet sampling flow rate of 300 L/min. Fully equipped, the sampler has two virtual 
impacts for size fractionation of airborne particles and a Poly-Urethane Filter (PUF) sampler for 
analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air samples. The sample is acquired with an 
omni-directional inlet, a PM10 (10 μm cut) virtual impact classifier, a PM2.5 or PM10 virtual impact 
classifier, a fine particle filter and a PFU sampler. This configuration facilitates operation as a high 
volume dichotomous sampler for size fractionation of airborne particles in the 0–2.5 μm and 2.5–10 
μm aerodynamic size ranges. When only one virtual impact is installed, it can be operated as a 
PM2.5 or PM10 sampler, depending on the cut point diameter of the classifier. 
Air is aspirated at 300 L/min from the ambient atmosphere. Particles with aerodynamic 
equivalent diameters >10 μm are removed from the air stream by the PM10 classifier and discarded. 
Particles with diameter flow < 10 μm to the PM2.5 classifier located downstream. Particles in the 
2.5–10 μm range (coarse fraction) are collected on a 62 mm × 165 mm filter, and those <2.5 μm 
(fine fraction) are collected on a 200 mm × 250 mm final filter (Universal Air Sampler, 1996). 
Quartz filters (62 mm × 165 mm, and 200 mm × 250 mm) were weighed before and after sampling 
to determine the amount of particulate matter collected.  
Meteorological analysis was made using a Watchdog weather station Model 525 (Spectrum 
Technologies, Inc., USA). The weather station generates data for wind speed, wind direction, 
temperature and humidity during the sampling period. 
After final weighing, all the projection film filters and quartz filters, dry deposition plate, PS-1 
and UAS sampler were cut into appropriate sizes for further metallic element chemical analysis. 
Then the filter sections were placed in 200 ml bottles for each sampling group. Projection film 
filters underwent salvation by hexane to remove the grease. Thirty milliliters of hexane was added 
to each bottle and mixed for 40 min. These solutions were heated dry. At this point, only dry 
 5
and the relative standard deviation was <5%. 
Analysis for the same standard solution was repeated 12 times. Reproducibility tests 
demonstrated the stability of instruments. The relative standard deviation was 0.23–0.89. 
Method detection limit (MDL) was utilized to determine the lowest concentration level that can 
be detected that is statistically different from that of a blank. The MDL was determined by selecting 
the concentration slightly higher than lowest concentration of the standard line. This blank 
concentration is repeated seven times to estimate standard deviation. Then, the MDL was based on 
300% of the standard deviation for the blank concentration. 
 
4. Result and discussions 
4.1 TSP Mass Concentrations and Meteorological Conditions 
Table 1 presents the sampling data for downward dry deposition flux, total suspended 
particulate matter concentrations, dry deposition velocity and meteorological conditions such as 
temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and prevalent wind direction at the TA 
sampling site. Average downward dry deposition flux, TSP and dry deposition velocity were 
6.7±2.5μg m-2sec-1, 120.6±30.68 μg m-3 and 6.1±3.0 cm sec-1, respectively. The average temperature 
and relative humidity were 25.55±4.80℃ and 72.15±4.55%, respectively. The principal wind 
direction was ENE during the sampling period.  
The average total suspended particulate matter concentration was 120.6±30.68 μg m-3. Wu et 
al. (2006) demonstrated that the average TSP concentration was 155.9 μg m-3 at  harbor sampling 
site. The average TSP concentration at TA was roughly 0.8 times that at the harbor sampling site. 
The average downward dry deposition flux was 6.7±2.5 μg m-2 sec-1 at the TA sampling site. Fang 
et al. (2004) also determined that the average downward dry deposition flux was 83.5 μg m-2 sec-1 
at traffic sampling site in central Taiwan.  
Table 2 also shows the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 concentration at the TA sampling 
site. Analytical results suggested that average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 were 38.13±8.44 μg 
m-3, 24.45±7.83 μg m-3 and 62.85±14.06 μg m-3, respectively. Fang et al. (2000) indicated that the 
average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 concentrations were 25.9 μg m-3, 12.2 μg m-3 and 38.1 μg 
m-3, respectively, at a suburban sampling site. The results demonstrated that average PM2.5, 
PM2.5–10 and PM10 concentrations obtained at the TA were approximately 0.67, 0.5 and 0.61 
times those at the suburban sampling site in central Taiwan. Wu et al. (2006) demonstrated that the 
average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 concentrations were 46.2±6.6 μg m-3, 28.3±7.9 μg m-3 and 
74.6±13.4 μg m-3, respectively, at the harbor sampling site. These measurement results indicated 
that the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 concentrations obtained at the TA were about 0.82, 
0.87 and 0.84 times those at the harbor sampling site in central Taiwan. 
The average ratio of fine-to-coarse particulate matter was 1.65 during the sampling period at 
the TA sampling site. Compared with a previous study, the average ratios of fine-to-coarse 
particulate matter were about 2.04 and 1.63 at the suburban (Fang et al., 2000) and harbor (Wu et al., 
2006) sampling sites, respectively. These measurement results also implied that fine particulate 
matter was the primary species at the TA sampling site. However, the average ratio of TSP to PM10 
 7
correlation coefficients for Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Mg obtained using total suspended 
particulate concentrations with dry deposition flux were 0.74, 0.64, 0.64, 0.74, 0.66, 0.69 and 0.85, 
respectively. The correlation coefficients for metallic element Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Mg 
obtained using coarse particulate matter concentrations with dry deposition flux were 0.61, 0.51, 
0.49, 0.76, 0.47, 0.64 and 0.65, respectively. The correlation coefficients for Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr 
and Mg obtained using fine particulate matter concentrations with dry deposition flux were 0.61, 
0.42, 0.54, 0.79, 0.46, 0.44 and 0.63, respectively. For most elements, the flux was very strongly 
correlated with total suspended particulate matter concentrations. Moreover, the correlation 
coefficients were slightly higher between flux and total particle concentrations than for flux and 
coarse particle concentrations. A likely reason for this result is that most flux is due to particles 
>2.5μm in size. High deposition velocities were caused by particulate matter >2.5μm. Deposition 
velocities were obtained using either total suspended particulate or coarse particulate matter 
velocities (Davidson and Wu, 1990; Holsen and Noll, 1992). 
 
5. Conclusions 
Results of the measurements presented in this paper give the following conclusions: 
(1) The average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 were 38.13±8.44 μg m-3, 24.45±7.83 μg m-3and 
62.58±14.06 μg m-3, respectively. These results indicated that the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 
concentration obtained at the TA were 0.82, 0.87 and 0.84 times those at the harbor sampling site 
(Wu et. al., 2006) in central Taiwan. 
(2) The average of fine-to-coarse particulate matter ratio was 1.65 during the sampling periods at 
the TA sampling site. Compared with a previous study, the average ratios of fine to coarse 
particulate matter were approximately 2.04 and 1.63 at the suburban (Fang et al., 2000) and harbor 
(Wu et al., 2006) sampling sites, respectively. 
(3) The dry deposition velocities of Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr and Mg were 1.54±0.44, 0.86±0.31, 
0.77±±0.32, 0.62±0.24, 1.21±0.42, 0.82±0.14 and 1.64±0.26 cm sec-1, respectively, at the TA 
sampling site. 
(4) The data obtained in this study indicated that the average concentrations of metal elements Fe 
and Mg were higher in fine particulate matter than in coarse particulate matter. This analytical result 
is similar to that obtained by Singh et al. (2002). The most plausible reason is that many swage 
treatment facilities are near the TA sampling site. 
(5) The correlation coefficients of mass in TSP, coarse, and fine particulate concentrations with dry 
deposition flux were 0.26, 0.11 and 0.01, respectively, at the TA sampling sites. For most elements, 
the flux was very strongly correlated with total suspended particulate concentrations. Additionally, 
the correlation coefficients were higher between dry deposition flux with total particle 
concentrations or with coarse particle concentrations than for dry deposition flux with fine particle 
concentrations.

ed particle pollution has become a critical prob-
an. Emissions of air pollutants in Asia have been
drastically in past decade [1]. The increase of atmo-
hropogenic emissions of heavy metals is particularly
in traffic areas. In fact these pollutants, carried by
c particles, may settle on the superficial air and their
might change the ratios among different chemical
eavy metals in the air. The analysis of some mete-
conditions, which may influence the fate of atmo-
ticles, is useful for an improvement characterization

Particulate matter (PM) has been given much attention in
recent decades due to its potential adverse health impact and the
subsequent need to have a better control or regulate these pollu-
tants. The sources, characteristics and potential health effects of
the larger or coarse particles (>2.5 mm in diameter) and smaller
or fine particles (2.5 mm in diameter) are very different; the lat-
ter can more readily penetrate into the lungs and are therefore
more likely to increase respiratory and mutagenic diseases [4].
However, it is not yet known whether the health effects may be
caused by the large number of particles or perhaps by some toxic
components in the particulate matter. Coarse PM metal concen-
tration trends are governed by variations in the wind speeds in
each location, whereas the diurnal trends in the fine PM metal
concentrations are found to be a function both of the prevailing
meteorological conditions and their upwind sources. Among the
many pollutants highlighted for adverse health effect, particu-
lar attention has been focused on fine particulates [5,6]. The
underlying biological causes of the health effects of fine parti-
cles exposure are not clear, thus an investigation of their physical
and chemical characteristics is important to elucidate particles

4. Conclusions
The main conclusions in this study are listed as follows:
1. The average particulate concentrations of TSP were higher
than coarse and fine particulate concentrations, and the order
was TSP > fine > coarse particle during September to Decem-
ber of 2005 at Taichung airport sampling site.
2. As for the metallic concentrations in TSP, coarse and fine
particulates, the metallic elements of Fe and Mg were the
main metallic elements at TA sampling site. In addition, result
also showed that SO42− has the highest ionic concentrations
in TSP and fine concentrations. However, the ionic species
of NO3− was the main components in coarse particulate size
mode.

particles are greatly affected by gravity, and finer
particles are more affected by diffusion (Chan and
Kwok 2000). Carbonaceous species constitute a
significant fraction of ambient respirable suspended
particulates (RSP or PM10) and fine suspended
particulates (FSP or PM2.5), ranging from ∼10% in
remote areas to ∼40% in urban areas. Carbonaceous
species constitute a significant fraction of ambient
respirable suspended particulates (RSP or PM10) and
fine suspended particulates (FSP or PM2.5), ranging
from ∼10% in remote areas to ∼40% in urban areas
(Seinfeld and Pandis 1998). The sources, character-
istics, and potential health effects of the coarse
(PM2.5–10) particles (diameter in 2.5–10 μm) and fine
(PM2.5) particles (diameter smaller than 2.5 μm) are
different. Fine particulate not only readily penetrate
into the lungs but also are likely to increase res-
piratory and mutagenic diseases (Fang et al. 2002;
Cincinelli et al. 2003).
The carbonaceous materials are classified into two
types, organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC),
with respect to their chemical properties. EC and OC
play important roles in various atmospheric processes.
EC acts as a positive climate forcing as it absorbs solar
radiation whereas OC overall serves as a negative
climate forcing as it is mainly a scattering medium
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2001).
Recent studies have suggested that the contribution of
EC to global warming may be substantial (Jacobson
2001; Hansen et al. 2000). It has been estimated that
EC emissions in China account for roughly one-fourth
of the global anthropogenic EC emissions (Cooke
et al. 1999; Streets et al. 2001). Model simulations by
Menon et al. (2002) suggests that EC emissions from
China and India may be responsible for the increase
in droughts in northeast China and flooding in
southeast China in the summer observed during the
last 20 years. Both EC and OC contribute to visibility
degradation by either absorption or scattering of light
(Watson 2002). Secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
contribution to PM2.5 mass in ambient air is assessed
by means of the primary OC/EC ratio approach, based
on chemical data of the filters from the TU. Organic
and inorganic secondary production in the outdoor
atmosphere is contributing for about 75% of PM2.5
mass in winter and 40% in summer: as a consequence,
effective long-term actions, still controlling the emis-
sions of primary pollutants too, are required for air
quality standards attainment and the potentiality of
short-term interventions, as traffic restriction, appears
quite limited (Giugliano et al. 2005). Despite their
importance, information concerning the spatial and
temporal variability of EC and OC in the Asian
Continent is still limited. Most of the available data
cover only a limited measurement period that range
from a few weeks (Xu et al. 2002; Cao et al. 2003) to a
few seasons (Ho et al. 2002; Lee and Kang 2001). EC
seasonality is found to depend on the distance from
and relative location to the city container port. A
cluster of five stations to the immediately north of the
container port have higher EC levels in the summer
than in the winter as a result of being downwind of
ship emissions in the summer, but upwind in the
winter. OC has a clear seasonal pattern of higher
concentrations observed in the winter than in the
summer at all the 10 monitoring stations (Yu et al.
2004). Transportation of pollutants from the Asian
continent may be responsible for the elevations of EC/
OC at the remote site. More than 74% of the EC and
more than 79% of the OC were found in the PM
fraction at the three sampling 2.5 locations (Ho et al.
2002). High OC values in June resulted from primary
anthropogenic emissions and secondary organic aero-
sol formation rather than the atmospheric transport of
organic compounds from the outside. In urban area of
Seoul, the OC and EC concentrations in PM2.5 during
the summer were higher than those measured at other
urban atmospheres. OC/EC ratios obtained in Seoul
were lower than Sihwa (Park et al. 2001). The
objective of this study is to investigate the ambient
suspended particles and OC and EC composition
during the period of July to October of 2005 at
Taichung harbor. Sampling campaigns for the pro-
duction of PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 filters, to be speculated
for the major chemical components, have been
performed at the TH sampling site by means of a
Universal air sampler. The results indicate ate that the
PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 coarse particles mass composition
is analyses in terms of carbon species, elemental
carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC). For the carbon
species in particular, the chemical characterizations
suggests a reliable estimate of the average primary
OC/EC, representative of the real traffic emissions in
the area around Taichung harbor. The primary OC/EC
ratio approach is applied to assess the contribution of
secondary organic aerosol (SOA) to the fine and
coarse particles mass at the Taichung harbor sampling
site (Fig. 1).

when reflected laser light attained its original intensity
after oxygen was added to the combustion atmo-
sphere), and three EC fractions (EC1, EC2, and EC3
at 600, 700, and 800°C, respectively, in a 2% oxygen/
98% helium atmosphere). IMPROVE OC is opera-
tionally defined as OC1+OC2+OC3+OC4+OP and
EC is defined as EC1+EC2+EC3-OP. An inter-
laboratory comparison of IMPROVE with the DRI
Model 2001 instrument with the (thermal manganese
dioxide oxidation) TMO methods (done by AtmAA,
Inc., in Calabasas, CA) has shown good (the
difference was smaller than 5% for Total Carbon
[TC] and 10% for OC and EC). Twelve blank filters
were also analyzed and the sample results were
corrected by the average of the blank concentrations,
which were 1.56 and 0.60 mg m−3 for OC and EC,
respectively. Particular quality assurance/ quality
control (QA/QC) procedures were described in Cao
et al. (2003).

eric Rparticulate matter pollutants that are principally due to
emission sources, and rapid mixing and dilution of street
level emissions (Väkevä et al., 1999).
The actual compounds identified in a given ambient
sample have a strong correlation with the chemical
composition of source emissions. Aerosols are typically
from five principal sources: (1) continental dust; (2) sea
spray; (3) combustion processes; (4) chemical reactions;
and, (5) industrial processes involving gaseous compo-
nents. Volcanic activity also produces particulatematter in
all size ranges. The mass concentrations of suspended
particulate matter in air are called total suspended parti-
culates (TSP). Particles b10 μm (0.01 mm) in aerody-
namic diameter are called respirable particulate matter or
PM10 (PM=particulate matter), whereas PM2.5 denotes
fine particulate matter b2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter
(Ohlström et al., 2000). Both PM10 and PM2.5 measure-
ments are included in US ambient air quality standards
(US-Environmental Protection Agency, 1987 for PM10).
Particulate matter size and shape are crucial factors
controlling the extent to which airborne particulate matter
penetrates the human respiratory tract. Metallic elements
in coarse particulate matter (PM2.5–10) are deposited in the
upper respiratory tract, whereas fine particulate matter
(PM2.5) move deep into the lungs, and the finest particles
reach the alveolar region (Voutsa and Samara, 2002).
Dry deposition velocity strongly depends on partic-
ular variables; such as particulate matter size, meteoro-
logical and atmospheric stability, relative humidity, wind
speed and characteristics of the deposition surface
(Caffrey et al., 1998). Various areas of research have
examined dry deposition of air pollutants. And it has
long been known that airborne particles are associated
with adverse effects on amenity via a reduction in
visibility and soiling of buildings. Associations between
suspended particulate matter and lung function para-
meters, respiratory symptoms and mortality have been
demonstrated (Dockery et al., 1993). Investigations have
indicated that, depending on particle size, particles are
deposited in different regions of the human respiratory
system—fine particles penetrate deepest into lung
passages. Lung deposition peaks at 20% for 3 μm
particles and 60% for 0.03 μm particles (Swift and
Proctor, 1982). Epidemiological studies conducted in
several countries demonstrated consistent associations
between exposure to ambient particulate matter and
adverse health effects, including increased mortality,
hospitalization for respiratory and cardiovascular dis-
ease, and respiratory symptoms and reduced lung
function. Based on epidemiological time series studies,
a dose–response relationship was identified between
G.-C. Fang et al. / Atmosphincreased PM and adverse health effects (El-Fadel andMassoud, 2000). However, recent studies have indicated
that particle matter concentration may be a better
indicator of health risk than particle mass (Oberdorster
et al., 1992; Oberdorster, 1995). In Taiwan, low wind
speed combined with strong sunlight retains pollutants
beneath an inversion layer and causes extreme air
pollution.
This study has the following objectives: (1) to
measure the dry deposition fluxes of particulate matter
total mass and metal elements at the Taichung Airport
site (Taichung is a small city located in central Taiwan);
and (2) to characterize ambient air suspended, fine, and
coarse particle concentrations and dry deposition in this
region. Meteorological conditions, such as wind speed,
wind direction and temperature, were also measured.
2. Materials and method
2.1. Sampling site
The sampling site was selected to best characterize
the concentrations at Taichung Airport (TA) in central
Taiwan. The sampling site is approximately 10 m from
ground level. Fig. 1 presents a runway 3658 m long by
61 m wide. The airplane parking area occupies
36,280 m2. The sampling site was located about
1.5 km south of the TA. Roughly 25 airplanes take off
and 23 airplanes land at the TA daily. The purpose of
this study was to characterize the ambient air
suspended, fine, coarse particulate matter concentra-
tions and dry deposition fluxes at Taichung Airport in
central Taiwan. In this study, one Total Suspended
Particle Sampler (PS-1), Universal Air Sampler TM
(UASTM) and dry deposition plates were used to
collect particulate matter simultaneously. Meteorolog-
ical conditions such as temperature, relative humidity,
wind speed and wind direction were also monitored.
2.2. Sampling program
2.2.1. Sample collection
2.2.1.1. Dry deposition plate. Dry deposition flux was
measured utilizing a smooth surface plate with a sharp
leading edge, mounted on a wind vane. The plate, which
was made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), was 21.5 cm
long, 8.0 cm wide and 0.8 cm thick, and had a sharp
leading edge that pointed into thewind. The plate was cut
to slide onto two rods 3.0 cm in diameter; two screws
fastened the plate to a wind vane, allowing the plate to
swing freely in the wind. The plate was fitted to a
281esearch 84 (2007) 280–289galvanized iron stand. The stand could be adjustable to
2.2.2. Meteorological analysis
Meteorological analysis was made using a Watchdog
weather station Model 525 (Spectrum Technologies,
Inc., USA). The weather station generates data for wind
speed, wind direction, temperature and humidity during
the sampling period.
2.2.3. Chemical analysis
After final weighing, all the projection film filters and
quartz filters, dry deposition plate, PS-1 and UAS sam-
pler were cut into appropriate sizes for further metallic
element chemical analysis. Then the filter sections were
placed in 200 ml bottles for each sampling group.
Projection film filters underwent solvation by hexane to
remove the grease. Thirtymilliliters of hexane was added
to each bottle and mixed for 40 min. These solutions

was left in the empty bottle. Then 10 ml ultrapure HNO3
was added to digest the particulates at 200–250 °C for
2 h. Following this procedure the solution was diluted
with distilled–deionized water to 30 ml. A Hitachi Z-
5000 series polarized Zeeman flame atomic absorption
spectrophotometer was utilized to measure trace metal
concentrations after digestion.
2.2.4. Formula and calculation
The mass measurement method weighed and
recorded surface weight after exposure in atmosphere
that allowed them to equilibrate. This procedure can be
divided into the following steps:
1. Wash the cut surrogate surface.
2. Coat the adsorbent (silicone grease).
3. Weigh after obtaining moisture equilibrium (W0).

285eric Research 84 (2007) 280–28962.85±14.06 μg m−3, respectively. Fang et al. (2000)
indicated that the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10
concentrations were 25.9 μg m−3, 12.2 μg m−3 and
38.1 μg m−3, respectively, at a suburban sampling site.
The results demonstrated that the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10
and PM10 concentrations obtained at the TA were
approximately 0.67, 0.5 and 0.61 times those at the
suburban sampling site in central Taiwan. Wu et al.
(2006) demonstrated that the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10
and PM10 concentrations were 46.2±6.6 μg m
−3, 28.3±
7.9 μg m−3 and 74.6±13.4 μg m−3, respectively, at the
harbor sampling site. These measurement results indi-
cated that the average PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10
concentrations obtained at the TA were about 0.82,
0.87 and 0.84 times those at the harbor sampling site in
central Taiwan.
The average ratio of fine-to-coarse particulate
matter was 1.65 during the sampling period at the
TA sampling site. Compared with a previous study, the
average ratios of fine-to-coarse particulate matter were
about 2.04 and 1.63 at the suburban (Fang et al., 2000)
and harbor (Wu et al., 2006) sampling sites, respec-
tively. These measurement results also implied that
fine particulate matter was the primary species at the
TA sampling site. However, the average ratio of TSP
to PM10 was 1.96 during the sampling periods at the
sampling site. The average TSP-to-PM10 particulate
matter ratios were roughly 1.59 at the suburban (Fang
et al., 2000) site and 2.09 at the harbor site (Wu et al.,
2006). The measurement results also reflected that the
average PM10 particulate matter concentration was ap-
proximately 1.5 times at the Taichung harbor.
3.2. Elemental fine/coarse TSP mass concentrations
Table 3 presents the average metal element concen-
trations of fine particulate matter, coarse particulate
matter and the ratios of fine/coarse particulates. Average
fine particulate concentrations for metal elements were
as follows: Fe, 301.67±89.68 ng m−3; Mn, 16.32±
5.65 ng m−3; Cu, 16.69±5.09 ng m−3; Zn, 82.99±
26.71 ng m−3; Pb, 28.04±6.57 ng m−3; Cr, 19.86±
3.80 ng m−3; and, Mg, 110.22±29.95 ng m−3. The
average coarse particle concentrations for metal
elements were as follows: Fe, 67.07±29.74 ng m−3;
Mn, 9.62±3.30 ng m−3; Cu, 10.45±4.59 ng m−3; Zn,
29.99±12.11 ng m−3; Pb, 16.15±2.88 ng m−3; Cr,
13.25±3.54 ng m−3; and, Mg, 59.67±22.92 ng m−3.
Furthermore, measurement results also identified the
average fine-to-coarse ratio for the following metallic
elements at the TA sampling site: Fe, 5.04±1.87; Mn,

control or regulate these pollutants. The sources,
characteristics, and potential health effects of the
larger (coarse) particles (diameter in 2.5–10 μm) and
smaller (fine) particles (diameter smaller than 2.5 μm)
are different. Fine particulate not only readily pene-
trate into the lungs but also are likely to increase
respiratory and mutagenic diseases (Fang et al.,
2002). In Taiwan, the number of vehicles on the main
roads has increased in recent decades. Motor vehicle
exhaust is an important source of fine particles (Nolte,
Schauer, Cass, & Simoneit, 2002). Larger particles
are greatly affected by gravity and fine particles are
more affected by diffusion (Chan & Kwok, 2000). It
is very interesting to note that the levels of PM in
Buenos Aires decrease from summer to autumn–
winter, while the opposite behavior was observed in
São Paulo. This is probably due to the different
topography and meteorological characteristics. The
higher values of PM found in summer with respect to
winter are in agreement with the abundance of re-
suspended material in summer at Buenos Aires, due
to the effect of wind (Bogo et al., 2003). Wind
direction is an index that effectively accounts for the
impact of upwind sources when these sources are
nearby, or when a strong correlation exists between
the upwind transport paths and the wind directions. In
other situations, wind direction may not be a good
index to represent the influence of upwind sources
(Lin & Wu, 2003). A characteristic seasonal variation
can be observed for PM10 and PM2.5 with elevated
concentrations during the cold season. The reasons for
this are not primarily caused by seasonal fluctuations
of the emissions, but rather by meteorological effects
(Gehrig & Buchmann, 2003). The coastal marine
atmosphere adjacent to large urban and industrial
centers can be strongly impacted by pollution emis-
sions, resulting in high loading of pollutants in the am-
bient air (Baker et al., 1997; Eisenreich, Hornbuckle,
& Achman 1997; Holsen et al., 1997). The elements
of Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca and Fe have been found to form
a major fraction of aerosol particles collected in China
during dust storms (Fan et al., 1996). Secondary
sulfate, wood combustion, diesel exhaust, secondary
ammonium, secondary nitrate, meat cooking, gaso-
line-powered motor vehicle exhaust, and road dust
were responsible for the main components of fine
particulate (PM2.5) concentrations (Kleeman & Cass,
2001; Schauer, Fraser, Cass, & Simoneit, 2002;
Zheng, Cass, Schauer, & Edgerton, 2002). Concen-
trations of air pollutants varied with meteorological
conditions and pollutant emission level (Lu, 2002).
Ambient weather conditions such as air temperature,
relative humidity and short wave radiation can also
influence chemical reactions leading to secondary
aerosol formation (Marcazzan, Vaccaro, Valli, &
Vecchi, 2001). Traffic emission represents various
potential sources of metals, including combustion
products from fuel and oil, wear products from tires,
brake linings, bearings, coach and road construction
materials and re-suspension of soil and road dust. (El-
Fadel & Hashisho, 2001, for a review). Heavy metals
(such as lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic and
mercury) are formed and enriched as different size
particles, removed from the atmosphere by absorption,
adsorption, and chemical reaction (Yoo et al., 2002).
This study investigated and characterized ambient air
particulate concentrations and meteorological condi-
tions and their associated metallic elements and ions
species at the Taichung harbor sample site.
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Sampling site
Figure 1 shows the sampling geographical distribu-
tion. Tacihung Harbor (TH site) sampling site was set
on the roof of a building of four floored building. This
site could be characterized as harbor sampling site.
Taichung harbor (TH) was located in the western side
of central Taiwan. It was occupied about 37,600 acres
which included 960 water and 2,800 land areas.
Taichung harbor was an artificial harbor and has the
maximum amounts of 83 ports. The sampling site of
this study was located at the chemical port area which
about 100 m on the east side of Taiwan Strait.
2.2 Sampling program
2.2.1 Sample collection
2.2.1.1 Total suspended particle sampler
In this study, the ambient particle concentration was
collected by PS-1 (Total Suspended Particle Sampler)
and dry deposition plate. The PS-1 (GPS1 PUF
Sampler, General Metal Work) is a completed air
sampling system designed to simultaneously collect
suspended airborne particles at flow rate up to
260 Environ Monit Assess (2007) 128:259–275
spectrophotometer was used to measure the trace
metal concentration after digestion process.
2.2.3 Quality control
2.2.3.1 Blank test
The blank test can be used to determine the background
contamination form the analysis processes. Back-
ground contamination was routinely monitored by
using operational blanks which were processed simul-
taneously with field samples. In this study, the back-
ground contamination is insignificant and be ignored.
The results of the blank test are 0.3, 0.25, 0.1, 0.3, 0.27,
0.31 and 0.46 μg for Cl−, NO3
−, SO4
2−, Na+, NH4
+,
Mg2+and Ca2+, respectively. The results of the blank
test for metallic elements are 0.43, 0.36, 0.30, 0.25,
0.21, 0.19 and 0.17 μg for Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cr
and Mg, respectively.
2.2.3.2 Detection limit
Detection limit was used to determine the lowest
concentration level that can be detected to be
statistically different from a blank. The detection
limits of the elements in this study were 0.020, 0.010,
0.010, 0.015, 0.012, 0.027 and 0.014 mg/l for Cl−,
NO3
−, SO4
2−, Na+, NH4
+, Mg2+and Ca2+, respectively.
And method detection limit for metallic elements
were 0.024, 0.008, 0.024, 0.013, 0.016, 0.011, 0.018
and 0.017 mg/l−1 for Fe, Mg, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni and
Pb, respectively. Method detection limit was de-
termined from selected the concentration slightly
higher than the low concentration of the standard
line, repeated this concentration for 12 times to es-
timate the standard deviation (S).
2.2.3.3 Recovery efficiency test
At least 10 of the samples are analyzed in spiking
with a known amount of ionic to calculate recovery
efficiencies. The analysis procedure for the recovery
test is the same as that described for the field samples.
The results indicated the range of recovery efficiency
test varies between 95% and 109% and the relative
standard deviation is smaller than 10%. And the
recovery tests of metallic elements were 98%, 96%,
94%, 106%, 101%, 104%, 101% and 102% for Fe,
Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cr, Ni and Mg, respectively. The
range of recovery efficiency test varies between 94%
and 106% and the relative standard deviation is
smaller than 6%.
2.3 Sampling information
Table I showed the seasonal sampling information of
temperature (C°), relative humidity (%), prevalent
wind direction and atmospheric pressure (hpa) at TH
sampling site during March 2004 to January 2005
sampling periods. The results indicated that the
average meteorological data of spring, 2004 (Mar.,
Apr., May) for temperature, relative humidity,
prevalent wind direction and atmospheric pressure
were 21.4 °C, 73.9%, NNE and 1,011.8 hpa,
respectively.
In addition, the results indicated that the average of
summer, 2004 (Jun., Jul., Aug.) for temperature,
relative humidity, prevalent wind direction and atmo-
spheric pressure were 29.02 °C, 75.2%, NNE, NE and
1,009.6 hpa, respectively. The results also indicated
that the average of autumn, 2004 (Sep., Oct., Nov.)
for temperature, relative humidity, prevalent wind
direction and atmospheric pressure were 24.42 °C,
71.92%, N, NE, SW and 1,009.75 hpa, respectively.
And the results indicated that the average of winter,
2004 (Dec.) and 2005 (Jan.) for temperature, relative
humidity, prevalent wind direction and atmospheric
pressure were 16.46 °C, 76.2%, N, NNW and
1,016.18 hpa, respectively. The maximum and mini-
mum of temperature were in summer (30.8 °C) and
winter (9.6 °C), respectively. The maximum and
minimum of relative humidity were in winter (81%)
and autumn (67%), respectively. And the maximum
and minimum of atmospheric pressure were in winter
(1,022.6 hpa) and summer (999.5 hpa), respectively.
In general, the relative humidity was all higher then
that of land (traffic, urban, suburban) sampling site
around central Taiwan.

262 Environ Monit Assess (2007) 128:259–275
3.2 Average concentrations of metallic elements
and ions species
The average metallic element concentrations and ionic
species of TSP, coarse and fine particulates during
March 2004 to January 2005 were shown in Figure 3a
and b. Figure 3a displayed average concentrations of
metallic elements in TSP, coarse and fine particulates.
The results indicated that the average metallic elements
concentration in TSP were higher than those of coarse
and fine particulate. With regard to the variations of
sampling periods, the mean metallic concentrations in
TSP were displayed in the following order: Fe > Zn >
Mg > Cu > Cr > Mn > Pb, respectively. And the mean
metallic concentrations of coarse and fine particulates
size were displayed in the following order: Fe > Mg >
Zn > Cu > Cr > Mn > Pb, respectively. Figure 3b
showed average concentrations of ionic species in
TSP, coarse and fine particulates. The results indicat-
ed that the average ionic species concentration in TSP

observed for elements Fe and Cr (rsp = 0.634); Cr and
Zn (rsp = 0.624). The results indicate that the traffic
pollutants (Fe, Mg, Cu, Cr, and Zn) might come from
similar pollutant sources at this traffic sampling site.
From Table IV, high correlation coefficients of non-
traffic pollutants were observed on the ion of SO4
2−.
The rsp values between the ionic species SO4
2− is
closed to rsp = 0.7 at TSP and fine particles size
mode. In general, the relationship between average
atmospheric pollutants concentrations of metallic
elements, ionic species and meteorological conditions
(temperature, relative humidity and wind speed and
atmosphere pressure) indicated that they were dis-
played negative correlations. In other words, the higher
the average temperature and relative humidity, the
lower the average atmospheric pollutants of metallic
elements and ionic species can be measured at
Taichung harbor sample site.

particles and meteorological parameters

coefficient of wsð Þβi means the secondary variation
amplitude with the triangle function of Cosine and
polynomial function. By taking out the mean values,
the above equation reveals that the TSP, coarse and
fine concentrations vary with different wind speed,
temperature, and different months. The results indi-
cated that the regression equation of the TSP
particulate concentrations are better than PM2.5 and
PM2.5–10, and the variations of the TSP, coarse and
fine concentrations tendency are similar. The concen-
trations of the TSP also had better results and simpler
relationship with the meteorological parameters. The
fine particulate concentration PM2.5 and coarse
particulate concentration PM2.5–10 present the random
tendency during the sampling period at WT sampling
site. As can be seen, when the particulate size was
small, it was hard to establish the well relationship
between the meteorological parameters.
3.5 Summarizes the atmospheric studies at different
sites around the world
3.5.1 Metallic elements
Table VI summarizes the metallic elements of
atmospheric studies at different sites around the
world. The relative discussions of those metallic
elements were showed as follows.
3.5.1.1 Metallic element of Fe
In Taichung harbor sampling site, the average Fe
concentrations in fine particulates and coarse par-
ticulates were 258.2 and 812.5 ng m−3, respectively.
The average TH (Taichung harbor) coarse particulate
concentrations values were close to Japan Osakai
Residential site (830 ± 240 ng m−3, Funasaka et al.,
2003) and USA Los Angelesa Riverside site
(737.55 ng m−3, Singh, Jaques, & Sioutas, 2002) but
lower than Yamaguchih (3,900 ng m−3, Mori,
Nishikawa, Tanimura, & Quan, 2003), Dhakae
(1,306 ± 766 and 1,119 ± 675 ng m−3, Begum, Kim,
Biswas, & Hopke, 2004). In addition, the fine to
coarse particulate concentrations ratios of Fe were
about 0.5 which is lower than that previous studies
obtained by (Fang et al., 2005).
3.5.1.2 Metallic element of Mg
Average concentrations of metallic Mg on fine
particulates and coarse particulates were 172.9 and
364.9 ng m−3, respectively, at TH (Taichung harbor).
Compared with other studies in Table VI, metallic
elements Mg concentrations were ranked as the
middle concentration around the world.
3.5.1.3 Metallic element of Cr
Chromium is a naturally occurring element found in
animals, plants, soil, and in volcanic dust and gases.
Average Cr concentrations in fine particulates and
coarse particulates were 109.9 and 113.9 ng m−3,
respectively, at TH (Taichung harbor). The fine and
coarse particulate concentrations of element Cr
decrease sharply at Taichung harbor even though the
ratios of fine to coarse particulate for element Cr
decrease to 0.681. Compared with other studies in
Table VI, metallic elements Cr concentrations were
ranked as the highest concentration around the world
in this study.
3.5.1.4 Metallic element of Cu
Copper is a reddish metal that occurs naturally in soil,
water, sediment, and, at low levels, air. Average Cu
concentrations in fine and coarse particulates were
86.4 and 91.8 ng m−3, respectively, at TH (Taichung
harbor). Metallic element Cu also displayed the same
concentrations distribution trend as element Cr. After
compared with other studies (Table VI), the highest
concentrations of Cu were also found in this study.
3.5.1.5 Metallic element of Zn
Zinc is one of the most common elements on earth
crust. It is found in the air, soil, and water and is also
present in all foods. Average Zn concentrations in fine

4 Conclusions
1. In this study, the components of main metallic
elements in TSP, coarse and fine particulates are
Fe, Zn and Mg during sampling periods at the
Taichung harbor. In another hand, the major ionic
species of NO3
−, SO4
2−, and NH4
+ are also the main
components for ionic species in TSP, coarse and
fine at Taichung harbor.
2. From correlation analysis, the traffic pollutants
(Fe, Mg, Cu, Cr, and Zn) might come from
similar pollutant sources at this traffic sampling
site. SO4
2− was also founded to have high
correlation coefficients of non-traffic pollutants
at TSP and fine particles size mode.
3. The characteristic functions F obtained for TSP,
coarse, and fine particulates concentrations which
included the meteorological parameters, tempera-
ture, and wind speed.
4. According to the regression equation and the
correlation analysis, the TSP particulates concen-
trations equations have well agreement results than
coarse, and fine particles at TH sampling site.

transfer from the atmosphere to the natural surfaces.
Atmospheric deposition of particles to ecosystem takes
place via both wet and dry processes. Wet deposition is
removal by precipitation scavenging and, to a lesser extent;
impaction of fog or cloud droplets on vegetation; and dry
deposition includes the uptake of gases at the surface and
the settling and impaction of particles. For both gases
and particles the dry deposition process comprises two
stages, atmospheric transport and uptake at the surface.
It occurs by several processes, such as Brownian motion
for nutrient cycling in ecosystems and it can also neutral-
ize acid inputs (Ruijgrok et al., 1995). Despite the impor-
tance of this topic, dry deposition of particles has received
far less attention. Theoretical methods used to assess or
predict amounts of dry deposition are extremely diverse,
largely because the types of contaminants and surfaces
vary greatly. However, dry deposition ﬂuxes are diﬃcult
to measure directly and instead are often estimated as
the product of dry deposition velocity and corresponding
pollutant concentration. Many studies suggested that
the contribution by dry deposition to total atmospheric(Vd) were studied at Taichung Harbor (TH) and Wuchi traﬃc sampling sites at oﬀshore sampling site near Taiwan Strait of central Tai-
wan during March 2004–January 2005. The average concentrations of TSP and dry deposition ﬂux at the TH sampling site were higher
than at the WT sampling site during the sampling period. The samples collected were analyzed by a ion chromatography (DIONEX-100)
for the ionic species (Cl, SO24 , NO

showed higher concentrations in winter and lower in summer for both TH and Wuchi sampling sites. Statistical methods such as cor-
relation coeﬃcient and principal component analysis were also used to identify the possible pollutant source.

sph2.2.3. Meteorological analysis
Meteorological analysis was made by WatchDog
weather station Model 525 (Spectrum Technologies, Inc,
USA). The weather station can provide data of wind speed,
wind direction and temperature during sampling period.
The weather station was set near the sampling site, which
were about 10 m and 5 m high from the sampling site.
2.2.4. Calculation of dry deposition ﬂux and velocity
The particle concentration and dry deposition ﬂux are
calculated as follows (Odabasi et al., 2002; Masahiro and
Kohji, 2005):
concentration ¼ W 1  W 0 ðgÞ
t ðsÞ  Q ðl=sÞ
Flux ¼ W 1  W 0 ðgÞ

1. Weighting the above surrogate surface after the mois-
ture equilibrium (W0) in reached.
2. Reweighting after the sampling period is completed and
reached moisture equilibrium (W1).
The dry deposition velocity of total suspended particu-
late mass and ionic species were calculated as follows:
V d ¼ K  FCTSP
where
Vd: the dry deposition velocity of total suspended partic-
ulate mass or ionic species (cm s1);

1) * (cm m

Two or three duplicate dry deposition plate samplers were
taken side by side during the sampling period. Each of the
plates was covered with transparency coated with thin sili-
con grease to collect impacted particles. After the grease
was sprayed onto the strips, the strips were baked in an
oven at 60.8 C for 2 h to remove volatile substances. Then,
placed in an electric chamber at humidity 50 ± 5% and
temperature 25 ± 5 C at least 24 h before both on and
oﬀ weight. The deposition surface in this study was pat-
terned after those used in wind tunnel studies (McCready,
1986) and ﬁeld samplings (Noll et al., 1988). It was
designed to provide minimum airﬂow disruption. The use
of a smooth, horizontal, surrogate surface provides a lower
bound estimate of the dry deposition ﬂux onto a horizontal
surface. Similar research for a dry deposition plate has
widely described and discussed in previous studies (Holsen
et al., 1993; Lee et al., 1993; Fang et al., 1997).

Sampling information of DDF (dry deposition ﬂux), TSP
(total suspension particle), Vd (dry deposition velocity) and
meteorological conditions such as temperature, relative
humidity, wind speed, prevalent wind direction and atmo-

Table 1. Average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
and atmospheric pressure were 22.6 ± 5.2 C, 74.2 ± 3.5%,
7.7 ± 1.1 m s1 and 1011.8 ± 4.9 hPa, respectively. During
the sampling period, the prevalent wind directions of spring,
summer, autumn, and winter were NE, SWW, NE, and
NNW, respectively. Average DDF of airborne particulatescontamination form the analysis processes. Background
contamination was routinely monitored by using opera-
tional blanks (unexposed ﬁlter) which were processed
simultaneously with ﬁeld samples. In this study, the back-
ground contamination is insigniﬁcant and be ignored.
The concentrations of the background contaminations

Deposition velocity is used as a measure of mass transfer
into the canopy (Hosker and Lindberg, 1982) and is calcu-
lated by dividing the deposition ﬂux of major ions by their
respective atmospheric concentrations. The deposition
velocities of seasonal variation for Cl, NO3 , SO

4. Discussions
4.1. Local variations of DDF and TSP
Average mass concentration of TSP in the winter was
70% higher than that in the summer. Because the geological
structure of coastal area around the TH sampling site is
open sands, the coarse particles were frequently re-sus-
pended by strong winds in winter. The average deposition
ﬂuxes of Cl, Ca2+ and Na+ were higher at TH than that
at Wuchi. However, the average deposition ﬂux of NO3
anion was higher at Wuchi than that at TH. The respective
oluble ions at (a) TH and (b) Wuchi sampling sites.
The principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to
detect common variability and imply source identity
between deposition and speciﬁc sources. Using PCA (SPSS
version 10.0), the factors with eigenvalue greater than 1 were
considered for varimax rotation to obtain the ﬁnal factor
matrix. The PCA performed onDDF data is shown in Table
5. In the case of DDF at TH sampling site, 59% of variance
was explained by two factors, the remaining 41% of the var-
iance being unique to individual variables. The ﬁrst factor
accounted for 38% of the total variance and included
Cl(0.71), SO24 ð0:73Þ, Mg2+(0.71), and Ca2+(0.70), which
may indicate for soil (Mg2+ and Ca2+), secondary aerosols
ðSO24 Þ, and marine salt (Cl) source. The second factor
which explained 21% of the total variance and included
NOð0:80Þ, indicating the contribution of atmospheric

were correlated at both TH (r = 0.69) and Wuchi (r = 0.50)
sampling sites, which implies their association and proba-
ble origin from marine salt.

matrix to predict possible sources at TH and Wuchi sam-

was explained by three factors, the remaining 35%of the var-
iance being unique to individual variables. The ﬁrst factor
accounted for 29% of the total variance and grouped
NO3 ð0:73Þ and SO24 ð0:71Þ, again indicating secondary
aerosols sources. The second factor explained 19% of the
total variance and included Ca2+(0.72) and Mg2+(0.70),
which may have been contributed by soil. The third factor
accounted for 17% of the total variance and included
Cl(0.76), again indicating the contribution of marine salt
source. Inasmuch as marine salt from the Taiwan Strait,
about 400 m from the TH and 30 km from the TH sampling
site were the main cause of this result.
