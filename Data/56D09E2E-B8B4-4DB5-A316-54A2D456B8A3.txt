Abstract 
This paper proposes an improved reversible data hiding 
method for grayscale images. Specifically, this method 
integrates the superiority of two existing schemes to improve 
secret data capacity. The main idea of this method is to 
classify image blocks into smooth or complex ones and then

them. In data embedding process, our hybrid method uses 
difference expansion transform and residue histogram shifting 
to carry secret data adaptively without any distortions. 
Experimental results show that the proposed method improves

1. 計畫緣由及目的 
Data hiding is an information security technology used to 
protect and camouflage secret data [4]. Its main concept is to 
embed secret data into an unimportant cover media, so that the 
data cannot be perceptible. Take an image as an example. The 
one embedded with secrets is called stego-image, which is 
required to possess high quality. As a result, it will not cause 
the suspicion during transmission of the stego-image so as to 
achieve the purpose of data protection. Therefore, compared 
with the conventional encryption, data hiding is more capable 
of escaping from detection and destruction. Nowadays, there 
are various literatures and studies related to data hiding 
[1-3,5-9,11], which consists of two branches, namely, 
irreversible data hiding and reversible data hiding. 
Irreversible data hiding can extract secret data only but 
cannot restore the content of carrier that has been destroyed. 
Generally, this branch provides very high hiding capacity [2]. 
On the contrary, reversible data hiding [1,3-11] have the 
advantages of restoring completely without any distortion and 
extracting secret data validly. This property is quite useful for 
some applications, such as in medical, military, law and 
satellite professional fields. A good hiding technique must 
meet three features of imperceptibility, capacity and security 
[2]. Besides these, reversible data hiding techniques should be 
also provided with reversibility.

3. 研究方法 
Residue Number System (RNS) applied to develop a 
reversible hiding technique is the earliest in [10]. It mainly 
uses the character of restriction and concentration in the 
residue. This way will increase the statistical value of the bin 
in peak point, and further enlarge the data capacity. Let two 
integers be a and b. We can get integers q and r to satisfy the 
equation of a＝b×q＋r. In Mathematics, a is called dividend, b 
is called divisor, q is called quotient and r is called remainder. 
Clearly, r is within the range of 0≦r＜b. Hence, the residue 
histogram is provided with concentration and restriction. This 
way not only improves the capacity of Ni et al.’s scheme [7] 
but keeps good image quality. 
Recently, available reversible data hiding schemes almost 
hide secrets by using a single embedding way or multilevel 
mechanism. The uniqueness of ecah image block is not taken 
into account. In this paper, we propose a hybrid reversible 
hiding method, which combines the advantages of histogram 
shifting and difference expansion. It can adaptively adopt 
distinct embedding means in accordance with block contents. 
First of all, our proposed method uses the standard deviation of 
statistics to determine whether an image block is smooth or not. 
If smooth, we will apply the difference expansion operation to 
this block. Due to the expansion, this hiding way is thus 
applicable to the smooth blocks. If complex, we will apply the 
residue histogram shifting to this block. The higher the peak 
value is, the more data it can embed. The detailed and 
complete embedding steps are listed as below: 
 
Secret Data Embedding Algorithm 
Step 1: Partition a H×W cover image into N non-overlapping 
blocks Bk, where each block is composed of n × n pixels. 
Step 2: Calculate mean value and standard deviation of each 
block Bk by using equations (6) and (7).

Step 3: Determine the type of each block by a predefined 
threshold TH. When the standard deviation is larger than TH, it 
indicates that the block belongs to a complex type and goes 
through steps 4 to 6. Otherwise, it belongs to a smooth type 
and goes through steps 7 to 9. 
Step 4: (complex type) Divide pixel values by a divisor bk to 
get the residues, as shown in equation (8), where divisors of N 
blocks are generated randomly. Next, count these residues and 
output the corresponding histogram. Let peak point and zero 
point of the histogram be P and Z, respectively. 
Rk(i, j)＝Bk(i, j) Mod bk    (8) 
Step 5: Shift the residue histogram according to the relation of 
P and Z so as to embed secrets as instructed in [12]: 
(1) When P＞Z, histogram bins between [P－1, Z＋1] will be 
shifted left one unit, that is to say the values within this 
range will be subtracted by 1. If a secret bit is 1, the 
original residue P will be changed to P－1. Otherwise, the 
residue P will still remain unchanged if a secret bit is 0. 
(2) When P＜Z, histogram bins between [P＋1, Z－1] will be 
shifted right one unit, that is to say the values within this 
range will be added by 1. If a secret bit is 1, the original 
residue P will be changed to P＋1. Otherwise, the residue 
P will still remain unchanged if a secret bit is 0. 
Step 6: Calculate new values by using the modified residues, 
such as B'k(i, j)＝Q(i, j) ×bk＋R'k(i, j) to get the stego-block. 
Step 7: (smooth type) Each two neighboring values in the 
block will be treated as a pixel pair. And, calculate difference d 
and mean value m of a pixel pair, as shown in equation (9). 
d＝| Bk(i, j)－Bk(i＋1, j)|,  
m＝  2/),1(),( jiBjiB kk +−   (9) 
Step 8: Expand the difference by two times and embed a bit in 
the last significant bit as present in the equation (2) above. 
Step 9: Calculate the new pixel values of the stego-block by 
using the original mean value m and the difference d'. 
B'k(i, j)＝m＋  2/)1( +′d ,  
B'k(i＋1, j)＝m－  2/d ′    (10) 
After the secret data embedding steps as illustrated above, 
our method will output a new stego-image, which looks like 
the cover image without any noticeable distortion. Thus, it 
meets the requirements of security and imperceptibility. When 
the receiver acquires this stego-image, he needs to extract the 
secrets by using the information of block type. For this reason, 
these must be compressed in advance and sent to the receiver 
securely together with the random key. The following is the 
algorithm of data extraction and image restoration. After all 
these steps are conducted, the receiver will get secret data and 
restore the original image completely. 
 
Data Extraction and Restoration Algorithm 
Step 1: Partition stego-image into N non-overlapping blocks B'k, 
each of which is composed of n × n pixels. 
Step 2: Determine whether an image block is smooth or not 
based on the type information. If smooth, it will go through 
steps 3 to 5. Else, it will go through steps 6 to 8.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Data hiding is an information security technology used to 
protect and camouflage secret data [4]. Its main concept is to 
embed secret data into an unimportant cover media, so that 
the data cannot be perceptible. Take an image as an example. 
The one embedded with secrets is called stego-image, which 
is required to possess high quality. As a result, it will not 
cause the suspicion during transmission of the stego-image 
so as to achieve the purpose of data protection. Therefore, 
compared with the conventional encryption, data hiding is 
more capable of escaping from detection and destruction. 
Nowadays, there are various literatures and studies related to 
data hiding [1-3,5-9,11], which consists of two branches, 
namely, irreversible data hiding and reversible data hiding. 
Irreversible data hiding can extract secret data only but 
cannot restore the content of carrier that has been destroyed. 
Generally, this branch provides very high hiding capacity [2]. 
On the contrary, reversible data hiding [1,3-11] have the 
advantages of restoring completely without any distortion 
and extracting secret data validly. This property is quite 
useful for some applications, such as in medical, military, 
law and satellite professional fields. A good hiding technique 
must meet three features of imperceptibility, capacity and 
security [2]. Besides these, reversible data hiding techniques 
should be also provided with reversibility. 
Most of available reversible data hiding schemes can be 
developed based on difference expansion [1,8,9] and 
histogram shifting [3,5-7,11]. The idea of reversible hiding 
was firstly proposed by Barton in 1997. Due to the limited 
data capacity, more and more researchers take advantage of 
image features to develop efficient reversible hiding methods 
[1,3,5-9,11]. In 2003, Tian put forth a reversible hiding 
method by using difference expansion [8]. Its principle is to 
vacate a space to embed a secret bit through expansion 
transform. Thodi and Rodriguez [9] utilized the prediction 
error, instead of difference values, for expansion embedding. 
In addition, Chang and Lu [1] took local correlation of larger 
neighborhood into account. Usually, these schemes based on 
difference expansion offer high embedding capacity, but the 
image quality would be destroyed strongly. 
Another well-known reversible data hiding technique is 
histogram shifting of Ni et al. [7]. It produces a histogram of 
pixel distribution, and then embeds secret data by shifting the 
histogram. Although this method achieves quite good image 
quality, data capacity is restricted by the statistics of 
histogram peak. In order to overcome this issue, Fallahpour 
and Sedaaghi [3] exploited image blocks to create more 
histograms. The literatures [5,6] both raised the amount of 
peak value by using the difference between adjacent pixels. 
Moreover, Zhao et al. [11] addressed a multilevel histogram 
modification mechanism to increase the data capacity. 
Overall speaking, methods based on difference expansion 
are unsuitable for complex images even although these have 
high hiding capacity. On the other hand, methods based on 
histogram shifting could provide good quality but limited 
capacity. Therefore, we combine the advantages of these two 
kinds of techniques to propose a hybrid reversible data 
hiding method. Our method considers about block types so 
as to conquer the problem of low capacity in the complex 
image. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 
2 introduces the histogram shifting method [7] and the 
difference expansion method [8]. Section 3 describes the 
proposed data hiding method in detail how an improvement 
in the hybrid method can enhance the embedding capacity. 
Section 4 shows some experimental results and conclusions 
are finally summarized in Section 5. 
II. RELATED WORKS 
A. Histogram Shifting 
In 2006, Ni et al. proposed the histogram shifting method 
[7] by adopting a statistical way to achieve the target of 
reversible hiding. Take the grey-scale image as an example. 
First is to count the amount of pixel values happened in the 
cover image and expresses them in a histogram as shown in 
Fig. 1, where the pixel values range from 0 to 255. The value

(2) When P˘Z, histogram bins between [Pˇ1, Zˉ1] will 
be shifted right one unit, that is to say the values within 
this range will be added by 1. If a secret bit is 1, the 
original residue P will be changed to Pˇ1. Otherwise, 
the residue P will still remain unchanged if a secret bit is 
0. 
Step 6: Calculate new values by using the modified residues, 
such as B'k(i, j)˙Q(i, j) ×bkˇR'k(i, j) to get the stego-block. 
Step 7: (smooth type) Each two neighboring values in the 
block will be treated as a pixel pair. And, calculate difference 
d and mean value m of a pixel pair, as shown in equation (9).

Step 8: Expand the difference by two times and embed a bit 
in the last significant bit as present in the equation (2) above.

using the original mean value m and the difference d'.

After the secret data embedding steps as illustrated above, 
our method will output a new stego-image, which looks like 
the cover image without any noticeable distortion. Thus, it 
meets the requirements of security and imperceptibility. 
When the receiver acquires this stego-image, he needs to 
extract the secrets by using the information of block type. 
For this reason, these must be compressed in advance and 
sent to the receiver securely together with the random key. 
The following is the algorithm of data extraction and image 
restoration. After all these steps are conducted, the receiver 
will get secret data and restore the original image completely. 
Data Extraction and Restoration Algorithm 
Step 1: Partition stego-image into N non-overlapping blocks 
B'k, each of which is composed of n × n pixels. 
Step 2: Determine whether an image block is smooth or not 
based on the type information. If smooth, it will go through 
steps 3 to 5. Else, it will go through steps 6 to 8. 
Step 3: (smooth type) Partition each two neighboring pixels 
into a pair and compute difference and mean value by using 
equation (11).

Step 6: (complex type) Compute residue R'k(i, j) by using the 
prior divisor, and then output the corresponding residue 
histogram. 
Step 7: Extract the secrets and restore the original pixels by 
using peak point P and zero point Z in the image block. 
(1) P˚Z: if the value of R'k(i, j) is Pˉ1, it indicates that the 
secret bit is 1 and the value needs to be modified as P. 
Otherwise, it indicates the secret bit is 0 and the value 
will remain unchanged. 
(2) P˘Z: if the value of R'k(i, j) is Pˇ1, it indicates that the 
secret bit is 1 and the value needs to be modified as P. 
Otherwise, it indicates the secret bit is 0 and the value 
will remain unchanged. 
Step 8: After extracting, shift histogram bins within [Pˉ2, Z] 
right one unit if P˚Z. Otherwise, shift bins within [Pˇ2, Z] 
left one unit.  
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
This section will describe some experimental results to 
demonstrate the performance of our proposed data hiding 
method with reversibility. Here, we use five 512h 512 
standard gray-level images. To begin with, we generate a 
pseudo random stream of bits as secret data and adopt the 
PSNR standard to evaluate the quality of stego-images. Fig. 
3 shows average results of proposed method in terms of data 
capacity and image quality under different thresholds TH. 
Obviously, data capacity will be improved with the increase 
of threshold, but image quality will become degraded. The 
reason is that the larger the threshold was, the less the 
number of complex blocks but the more the number of 
smooth blocks will be. In other words, there are more blocks 
adopted the difference expansion. Even though the distortion 
is produced, the PSNR value is totally over 30 dB which is 
generally imperceptible to human eye. 
Table I reveals a comparison between the results of the 
proposed method and other histogram-based works. In 
which, the block size is 6h6 in our scheme. It can be seen 
that our method is apparently better than the traditional 
histogram shifting method [7] and the method [10] in terms 
of data capacity. Furthermore, its payload is slightly superior 
to the method [5] when threshold value is set over 7. In 
addition, the proposed method improves the problem of low 
capacity for complex image ‘Baboon’ substantially from 
0.02 to 0.39 bpp. More discussions on stego-image quality 
are displayed in Figs. 4 and 5. Here, we take images ‘Lena’ 
and ‘Baboon’ as the example of smooth and complex ones, 
respectively. From the local result of two figures, we also 
observed that the complex image is suitable to use a larger 
threshold value than the smooth image. When we uses the 
value of TH = 15 in the proposed method, an obvious 
distortion is appeared in Figure 5(d). In brief, the proposed 
method can adjust the threshold adaptively according to the 
input image.
