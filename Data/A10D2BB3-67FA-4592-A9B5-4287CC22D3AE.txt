Abstract 
     Bacteriophage λ Red system has been proved to be an efficient technique for homologous 
recombination in E. coli. In this work, recombinant E. coli strains with 1-3 copies of lacZ genes 
were constructed by a plasmid-encoded Red system and examined their β-galactosidase 
expression. We also analyze the long term genetic stability of lacZ gene between chromosomal 
and plasmid expression system by serial dilution culture. After induction with 300µM IPTG, the 
3-copy lacZ strain produced a β-gal expression at 13000 Miller units, with its activity elevating 
with the time. Furthermore, the triple copy lacZ strain also has a sustainable β-gal expression 
through 60 hours upon induction. On the contrary, β-gal activity of the plasmid expression system 
could only last less than 36 hours. The result demonstrated the recombinant strains established by 
Red system has a great potential for LacZ protein production in industrial repeated fed-batch 
fermentation. 
Key words: linear transformation, plasmid instability, homologous sequence, auxotrophic 
defect

In this research, we used a λ Red encoded plasmid pKD46 and an auxotrophic E. coli strain 
ZSC114 to carry out linear transformation. Based on this plasmid-mediated recombination system, 
two cloning strategies were used to construct recombinant strains. First, functional linear DNA 
tetR-lacZ was prepared, transferred into ZSC114 and selected by its tetracycline resistance 
phenotype. Then glk-lacZ and manXYZ-lacZ were also recombined into the strain and selected by 
the complementation of its metabolism deficiency in glucose and mannose. We had constructed E. 
coli strains that carry 1-3 copies of lacZ gene. β-galactosidase expression of these newly 
constructed strains was investigated to examine the effects of chromosomal gene dosage on 
protein expression. We also analyzed genetic stability of ZSCGMtZ, the 3-copy lacZ strain, in 
serial dilution culture that simulated repeated fed-batch culture (10), during protein 
overexpression. 
Material and Method 
λ Red System 
The λ Red system used in this study is expressed from plasmid pKD46 (Table I). λ Red 
genes (exo, bet and gam) are regulated by PBAD promoter which is inducible by L-arabinose. 
Besides, repA101 makes pKD46 temperature sensitive, so it cannot exist under higher 
temperature (37-42 ). In order to execute linear transformation, pKD46 was transf℃ ormed into 
the following strains: ZSC114 (lacZ mutation), ZSCtZ (1 copy of lacZ) and ZSCGtZ (two copies 
of lacZ). Fig. 1 shows the mechanism of λ Red recombination in this study. 
 
Cloning Strategy 
An illustration of our cloning strategy is shown in Fig. 2. E. coli strain ZSC114 has two 
metabolism-related gene mutations, glk-7 and manZ11 (Table 1), hence it cannot grow on the 
plate that contains glucose or mannose as the sole carbon source. Because ZSC114 is not resistant 
to tetracycline, it cannot grow on tetracycline plate, either. Therefore, we employed λ Red linear 
 5
Plasmid pTML construction was carried out using the same conditions as those of pTGL. A 
3058-bp manXYZ fragment was amplified by PCR using VJS632 as template. The PCR product 
and plasmid pTRL01 were then cut with restriction enzyme NarI and SphI, ligated with T4 ligase, 
and transformed into E. coli strain ZSC114. Mannose-only M9 plate was later used to select for 
transformant. 
For linear recombination, pKD46 was transformed into each strain. ZSCtZ(one lacZ copy), 
ZSCGtZ (two lacZ copy) and ZSCGMtZ(three lacZ copy) were constructed by linear 
transformation. Plasmid pJL, constructed by the cloning of plasmid pJF and lacZ gene from the 
chromosome of wild type E. coli strain VJS632, was transformed into ZSC114 as a plasmid 
expression system for genetic stability comparison with ZSCGMtZ. 
Media and Chemicals 
All E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) media. For pKD46-carrying strains, 
antibiotic ampicillin was added to a final concentration of 100µg/ml for selection. For pJL 
selection, 200µg/ml of ampicillin was added. Tetracycline, glucose or mannose (Sigma) was 
added with concentration of 50µg/ml , 0.4%, 0.4% respectively to prepare for LB or M9 plate for 
transformant selection. IPTG (Sigma) was used at various concentrations as induction reagent. 
ONPG (O-Nitrophenyl-β-D-Galactopyranoside) was used at 4mg/ml to measure β-galactosidase 
activity. 
DNA Preparation and Manipulation 
Purification and manipulation of DNA (Miniprep Kit, Gene-Spin TM), along with genomic 
DNA preparation (DNeasy Tissue Kit, Qiagen), and transformation were executed using standard 
procedures (14) or the manufacturer’s instructions. All restriction enzymes and Taq polymerase 
were from Promega Corp. T4 DNA ligase was from New England Biolabs. 
 7
in 10﹪ acetic acid and 40﹪ methanol for 1 hr, and later destained in 10﹪ acetic acid and 45﹪ 
methanol for 6 hr to observe electrophresis outcome. 
β-galactosidase activity assay 
β-galactosidase assay was carried out as described in ref (15). Briefly, 100µl of cell culture 
was mixed with 900µl of Z buffer and 200µl of chromogenic substrate ONPG. The intensity of 
orange color was observed during the assay and 500µl of 1M Na2CO3 was later added to stop 
reaction. The enzyme activity of β-gal was measured in terms of Miller unit. 
Genetic Stability Analysis 
Serial dilution bath culture was used to analyze genetic stability of chromosome (ZSCGMtZ) 
and plasmid (ZSC114/pJL) expression system. Overnight culture from isolated colony of each 
strain was subcultured at an initial OD550=0.05 at 37 . After 1 ℃ hr, 300µM IPTG was added to 
ZSCGMtZ and one of ZSC114/pJL culture, while 5µM IPTG was added to the other ZSC114/pJL. 
Sampling andβ-galactosidase assay were done for every 2 hr, and the same quantity of IPTG were 
also added to keep constant experimental conditions. Serial dilution bath and assay were 
continued for 24 and 60 hr to examine long-term genetic stability of ZSCGMtZ and ZSC114/pJL. 
Results 
Confirmation of Recombinants 
To verify construction of the three recombinant strains, protein gel electrophoresis was 
performed. For comparison, a lacZ-containing plasmid pJL, as mentioned in methods, was 
transformed into the original host ZSC114 as a plasmid expression system. 300µM IPTG, if 
necessary, was added to each shaking cell culture after 1hr subculture. Samples were harvested 4 
hours after induction. As shown in Fig. 3, upon 300µM IPTG induction, expression of 
β-galactosidase (116 kDa) increased with lacZ copy number on the chromosome. Meanwhile, 
there’s no significant difference in LacZ expression among strains without induction. From these

observe genetic stability of ZSCGMtZ and ZSC114/pJL. After shaking for 1hr, various amounts 
of IPTG were added to each culture. Each culture were sampled for activity assay and diluted 
with fresh LB broth at an initial OD550 about 0.1 per 2 hours. The first dilution back was 2 hours 
after induction. To set a proper condition for comparison, before this test, a series of batch culture 
with different concentration of IPTG induction had been done on ZSCGMtZ and ZSC114/pJL to 
observe the appropriate induction concentration for the two strains. Finally we chose 300µM for 
ZSCGMtZ, 300µM and 5µM IPTG for ZSC114/pJL, since the initial specific β-gal activity is 
quite the same when ZSCGMtZ is induced by 300µM IPTG and ZSC114/pJL induced by 5µM 
IPTG. 300µM IPTG induction served to see the genetic stability of the two strains in LacZ protein 
overexpression. A very high activity, about 70,000 Miller unit, was observed in ZSC114/pJL with 
300µM induction , but it soon plunged to zero at 13th hr. ZSC114/pJL with 5µM induction had a 
longer duration of expression at a lower level, 1500 Miller unit, and also dropped to nothing at 
34th hr. The recombinant strain ZSCGMtZ, however, kept a stable expression at 6,000-8,000 
Miller units through 60 hours. While Protein overexpression is widely known as the main cause 
of plasmid instability, these data seem to suggest that it may not be a trouble in our chromosomal 
expression system. 
Discussion 
Since its first report by Murphy et al. (16), λ Red system has been an efficient homologous 
recombination technique and extensively used in Escherichia coli. This procedure is applicable to 
any E. coli strain and is inducible by L-arabinose (17). For application, this genetic technique had 
been used to make genetic mutants for analysis of functionally unknown genes (18). It also had a 
much higher efficiency than traditional gene replacement method. For example, studies 
conducted by Murphy et al. (16) had shown that Red mediated recombination event was about 
100-fold more efficient than that of recBC E. coli strains. Even in recA strains, Red-promoted 
recombination still worked well, though the efficiency was reduced about 10-fold (7). In the 
genetic engineering field, the development of such a highly efficient system is very crucial since 
it overcomes the difficulty executing gene replacement in E. coli. Here we adopted λ Red system 
 11
the activity accumulation phenomenon could only be seen in the 3-copy lacZ strain. The reason 
for this observation is unknown, so maybe further research should be conducted to investigate the 
issue. Meanwhile, although the maximumβ-gal activity of the 3-copy lacZ strain (13,000 Miller 
units) is much lower than that of common plasmid expression system (40000-80000 Miller units), 
we think that’s because the recombinant strain has just triple copy lacZ on its chromosome, so the 
production level may be further enhanced by more lacZ gene integration. 
In protein production, another topic to be addressed is genetic stability. As shown in Fig. 5, 
we could see at the same induction concentration (300µM), the expression level of our 
recombinant strain is not as high as that of common host/plasmid system, but it has a significant 
longer duration time in expression in our serial dilution experiment. In other words, the 
recombinant strain ZSCGMtZ has a better performance in long-term genetic stability. As we all 
know, most multi-copy vectors has the problem of plasmid loss during protein overproduction, 
which greatly reduces the product yield in large-scale fermentation. In the research issued by 
Chang et al. (20), they proposed a single copy plasmid model to attain a highly stable β-gal 
expression through 150 generations. Our recombinant strain could also maintain a stable 
expression at 6,000-8,000 Miller units through 60 hours. This indicates that the chromosomal 
expression system established in the present study has a great potential to be used in long term, 
repeated fed-batch protein production. 
As studies done by Sousa et al. (21) showed, the expression level of β-gal increased with the 
proximity the lacZ gene was closed to the origins of replication. The locations of the integrated 
lacZ in our recombinant strains are 7.77 min, 40.96 min and 54.03 min, respectively. However, 
we didn’t see a great association in production level to chromosomal positioning. Our 1-copy 
lacZ strain and 2-copy lacZ strain have about equivalent degree of activity, while only the 3-copy 
lacZ strain has the activity accumulation effect. So we think further research, such as the idea of 
integrating more lacZ into the recombinant strain, or using another E. coli strain as the host, are 
necessary.
