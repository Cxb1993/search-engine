sediment motion were first made possible 
using a synchronized LDV (laser-Doppler 
velocimetry) and high-speed cinematography 
(Nelson et al. 1995). From the measured 
results, they found that sweeps (Q4) 
collectively move the majority of the 
sediment; outward interactions (Q1) 
individually move as much sediment as 
sweeps; ejections and inward interactions 
(Q2 and Q3) move much less sediment. 
These observations were, however, made 
under very limited flow/sediment conditions, 
thus the generality of such findings remains 
to be further investigated 
In this work we incorporate a 
Gram-Charlier (GC) joint probability 
distribution of near-bed 2D instantaneous 
velocities into a mechanistic model to 
replicate the burst events and predict the 
consequent incipient motions of sediment. 
The role of turbulent bursting in sediment 
entrainment under various flow/grain 
conditions is explored.

3. Results Verification 
3.1. Time Fractions of Four Quadrants 
 
The predicted time fractions occupied 
by the four quadrants are compared with two 
sets of data. The first was obtained with a 
well-sorted sand, whose grain size was 
lognormally distributed with a mean of 0.9 
mm and a standard deviation of 0.1 mm. 
Measurements of the fluid velocities were 
made by the LDV at a point 5 mm above the 
bed. The mean flow condition was 
transitional ( 50≅+sk ), with =0τ 0.78 Pa, 
=bu 32.9 cm/s, =uσ 5.3 cm/s, =vσ 3.2 
cm/s, and =uvR –0.44. The predicted and 
observed patterns of iT  are shown in Fig. 2a; 
satisfactory agreement is demonstrated. 
Ejections (Q2) were the most common burst 
events; sweeps (Q4) were slightly less 
common. These two occupied more than 
65% of the duration. Inward interactions (Q3) 
were slightly more common than outward 
interactions (Q1). 
The second set was obtained using a 
flume with lead spheres (8 mm) placed atop a 
bed packed with glass beads (8 mm). 
Velocity measurements were made at 4.7 mm 
above the sphere. The flow condition was 
rough ( 500,1≅+sk ), with =0τ 8.7 Pa, 
=bu 34.6 cm/s, =uσ 16.1 cm/s, and 
=vσ 10.5 cm/s. The predicted and observed 
patterns of iT  are shown in Fig. 2b; 
satisfactory agreement is again demonstrated. 
Similar to those shown in Fig. 2a, ejections 
and sweeps (Q2 and Q4) were the most 
common events, but the time fractions of 
both were slightly reduced, probably due to 
the 70% packing density. Despite the flow 
regimes in these two sets of experiments 
were different, the patterns of iT  shown in 
Figs. 2a and 2b were similar, implying that 
the time fractions of the four quadrants may 
be insensitive to the flow regime, which will 
be elucidated further.

3.2. Fractional Contributions to Sediment 
Entrainment 
 
Simultaneous measurements of fluid 
velocities and sediment movement using a 
synchronized LDV and high-speed CCD are 
employed for verification of results. The 
predicted and observed patterns of iFC  are 
shown in Fig. 3a; satisfactory agreement is 
demonstrated. Sweeps (Q4) are the major 
contributor to sediment entrainment, with 
~50% of the entrainment attributed to sweeps;

4.2. Effect of Grain Size Distribution on 
Fractional Contribution 
 
Given the fact that the time fractions of 
four quadrants are not affected by either grain 
size or typical values of 0τ , it is speculated 
that the fractional contributions of four 
quadrants to sediment entrainment would 
respond to the variation of grain sizes. To 
address this issue, two types of sediment 
mixture (fine and coarse) are employed. Both 
mixtures are lognormally distributed 
covering a size range of 0.13–9.77 mm for 
the fine mixture ( =50D 1 mm) and 0.47–52.5 
mm for the coarse one ( =50D 6 mm). For 
each mixture, different grain sorting is 
considered, including well sorted ( gσ = 2) 
and poorly sorted ( gσ = 3.6), where gσ = 
geometric standard deviation = 5084 / DD . The 
predicted fractional contributions are given in 
Table 1; the results associated with uniform 
sediment ( gσ = 1) provide a basis for 
comparison. The values of 0τ  used for the 
fine and coarse mixtures are 3 and 10 Pa, 
respectively, the corresponding values of +sk  
are 110 and 1200, both in rough regimes. 
Entrainment of fine mixtures is 
dominated by lifting, with consistently more 
than 60% entrained by lifting (respectively 67, 
62, and 78% for the uniform, well-, and 
poorly-sorted ones); whereas entrainment of 
coarse mixtures is dominated by rolling, with 
consistently less than 30% entrained by 
lifting (respectively 4, 9, and 28% for the 
uniform, well-, and poorly-sorted ones). The 
fractional contributions of sweeps (Q4) are 
consistently the most significant in various 
mixtures due to the greater streamwise 
velocities ( u′ > 0) and time fractions 
( =4T 31%). Outward interactions (Q1) are 
the second significant, but only in the 
uniform and well-sorted fine mixtures. For 
the coarse mixtures and poorly-sorted fine 
sediment, however, the fractional 
contributions of ejections (Q2) exceed the 
corresponding values of outward interactions 
(Q1). The argument ‘sweeps (Q4) and 
outward interactions (Q1) are the two major 
contributors’ seems not valid for all types of 
sediment mixtures with different grain 
sorting.

To gain a further insight, the dominant 
mode of entrainment in each quadrant is 
individually identified by the values of 
PTPLi /  and PTPRi /  listed in Table 1. 
For the uniform and well-sorted fine 
sediments for which outward interactions 
(Q1) are the second major contributor, the 
dominant mode of entrainment in Q1 and Q4 
is lifting, in contrast to the rolling mode that 
dominates the entrainment in Q2 and Q3. 
However, in the coarse mixtures and 
poorly-sorted fine sediment for which 
ejections (Q2) are the second major 
contributor, the dominant mode of 
entrainment in the four quadrants is 
consistent, namely, lifting in the 
poorly-sorted fine sediment but rolling in the 
coarse mixtures. Therefore, whether outward
