I. MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is usually composed of a large number of energy-constraint stations
equipped with the capability of sensing, computing and wireless communication, and deployed to detect events
of interests and to send data to sink stations. In such a network, sensor stations operate with small batteries that
are difficult to replace in typical applications, and thus minimizing its energy consumption poses a considerable
challenge to the developers. For this problem, wireless communication has been identified as the dominant
power-consumption operation, which continuously intensifies the interest of researchers in the development of
energy-efficient wireless transmission schemes. However, the energy issue is mainly devoted to conventional
WSNs. In fact, there are different WSNs designed for varied applications requiring our attentions. In this work,
we consider the potential that if equipped with the capability of virtual multiple-input multiple-output (VMIMO)
realized by, for example, collaborative beamforming (CB) [1], a WSN can have the promise of greatly improving
network performance by remarkably increasing transmit power gain and by providing security and interference
reduction due to less transmit power being scattered in unintended directions. It had been indicated in [2] that
by fixing the power radiated by a given antenna element, ideal transmit beamforming with N antennas can
result in a N -fold increased range, an N2-fold increased rate or an N -fold decrement in the net transmitted
power, when compared with single-antenna transmission. An attractive example given there shows that with
distributed beamforming, an infeasible signal to noise ratio (SNR) from a single sensor transmission to an
overflying aircraft can be increased to provide an upload of image/video data or summarizes of sensor data
gathered over days or even months. This reveals a practical technique for long-haul transmission with power-
limited sensors and an adequate solution for building wireless visual sensor networks.
However, the related works for distributed beamforming mainly focus on the characteristics of beampatterns.
For example, the work in [1] uses the random array theory along with the assumption of uniformly distributed
sensor stations to analyze the CB beampattern. Similarly, the work in [3] uses Gaussian probability density
function to model the spatial sensor station distribution in a cluster of WSN, and then uses this model to
derive the average beampattern of CB and analyze its characteristics. Despite the beampattern analysis, the
cross-layer optimizations proposed so far seldom, if ever, consider the direct impacts of these beampatterns, and
further, the corresponding energy consumptions due to the cooperation of sensor stations on the VMIMO-based
WSNs. Taking these into account, we pay our attention here on developing a scheme that can cross the layers
of physical, MAC, and network, and seamlessly integrate the SINR constraint for generating active sets of
VMIMO links. To this end, we formulate the minimum energy cross-layer scheduling as a linear programming
(LP) problem with a column generation approach to efficiently select its transmission modes toward an optimal
solution.
Apart from the above, we consider also that a distributed algorithm is usually preferred because its centralized
counterpart may not work well in a WSN that is a distributed environment by default. Therefore, we next
develop a distributed algorithm with a powerful formulation for solving convex optimization problems, namely
subgradient method, to get rid of communication overheads and other drawbacks resulted from a centralized
approach. Specifically, with this method, the message to be exchanged can be limited within one-hop neighbors
of a node, resulting in low communication overheads.
II. RELATED WORKS
In the literature, certain research efforts have been done with their aims on reducing energy consumption
or maximizing network lifetime. Among these, the approaches with regard to the physical layer could be
considered first. For example, the work in [4] summarizes some power control schemes that can reduce the

each station has a single antenna operated in a half duplex mode, and its rectangular coordinates, (xk, yk),

.
Let Mi , i ∈ {1, 2, ..., kc}, be a cluster of stations located within the coverage range of its centre and Ci ⊂Mi
be a set of collaborative stations selected from Mi. To transmit, the source cluster head (CH) that starts
transmissions for a user session initialized within its cluster, say CHi, first broadcasts its data to the cluster
members Mi. Then, the ni = |Ci| cooperative stations (CN) will listen and transmit the data to the next cluster
head, say CHj , j ∈ {1, 2, ..., kc}\i if it is scheduled. In order to construct a main lobe towards CHj , the
carrier of each should be synchronized with initial phase Ψk = −2piλ dk(ϕj), where λ denotes the wavelength
and dk(φ) ≈ A − rk cos(φ − ψk) is the Euclidean distance between the kth station and a point (A,φ) at the
reference sphere r = A. With that, the array factor corresponding to the stations in Ci can be given by [18]
F (φ/Ci) =

where 1/ni is the normalization factor used to distinguish between gains coming from increased overall transmit
power and gains from cooperation. Then, with the array factor, the far-field beampattern would be defined as [1]
P (φ/Ci)
△
= |F (φ/Ci)|2 (2)
As shown in [19], the beampattern is only a relative measure of where the transmitted power is going. When
compared with that, the antenna gain is the absolute measure of how much of the transmitted power is actually
being transmitted in the direction φ, which can be obtained from the beampattern as
G(φ/Ci) =
2piP (φ/Ci)∫ 2pi

B. Network Communication Model
In this work, the multi-hop WSN is represented by the graph of G = (V,E), wherein a vnode i ∈ V denotes
a cluster in the network, and a link {i, j} ∈ E denotes the transmission that vnode i uses CB transmission
to communicate with vnode j (or more precisely CHj). In such a network, wireless communication can be

In the set of constraints, (9-b) represents the conservation law for source vnodes to ensure that the net amount of
traffic going out of a session source is equal to its end-to-end session rate, and (9-c) symmetrically represents
that for destination vnodes. (9-d) provides the conservation law for intermediate vnodes to ensure that the
amount of traffic of a session entering any intermediate vnode is equal to that exiting the intermediate vnode.
In these constraints, Eoutsm /E

dm
/Eoutv (E

sm /E

/Einv ) denotes the set of outgoing (incoming) links of source
vnode sm, destination vnode dm, or the other vnode v ∈ V , respectively. (9-e) gives the bandwidth constraint
to make sure that the total traffic on a link is no more than the average transmission rate. (9-f) denotes the
lifetime constraint, showing that the lifetime of a vnode should be equal to or larger than the network lifetime.
(9-g) gives the scheduling constraint, forcing that the summation of all elements in a transmission schedule
vector is equal to 1. (9-h) and (9-i) simply represent the valid constraints for link rate and scheduling vector,
respectively, and (9-j) gives the traffic load TLm for each session m.
2) Linear Programming: As can be seen readily, the MLCLOP formulation is not linear and may not be
easily solved. More specifically, it poses the following challenges:
• The data rate Rb{i,j} in terms of link capacity LC{i,j} is a global function of all the interfering powers,
and thus the transmit power is globally coupled with the other layers in the network.
• The variables of T , e{i,j} (and thus pk), and fm{i,j} are nonlinearly coupled with each other in the constraint
(9-f), which shows a complex relationship among the variables across the different layers.
To alleviate the first problem, the related works in [20]–[22] usually treat the power as a fixed value or formulate
it as an variable to be solved for a real number solution that can reduce the computation complexity on finding
the association between power and rate. Complementing these works, we introduce a column generation (CG)
approach for the case of both power and rate being discrete to support the upper layers as the most practical
scenario considered by the standards for implementation, which will be discussed in Sec. III-E. For the second
problem, we consider that if the transmission matrix Ξ is given a priori by the CG approach and so are e˜{i,j}
and Rb{i,j} , a nonlinearity can be identified in the constraint (9-f) as the product of T × fm{i,j} . For resolving
the nonlinearity, a single variable f̂m{i,j} is used to represents the total number of data for session m transmitted
through link {i, j} in the network lifetime T , rather than the product of these two variables. Similarly, p
k
involved is replaced by p̂
k
= T × p
k
to denote the overall duration scheduled for transmission mode k in the
network lifetime T . In addition, for the corresponding distributed algorithm to be presented, we consider to
replace the hybrid representation of links and vnodes in (9) to be a node-centric representation that can focus
on the relationship between a vnode i and its neighbors Ni. Taking these into account, we have
6
minimize q = 1/T (a)
subject to

p
k
≥ 0, 1 ≤ k ≤ K (g)
rm ≥ TLm, 1 ≤ m ≤M (h)
This results in a form that we will extend to solve in a distributed manner. However, it is still centralized
because both q and p
k
are global variables shared by all vnodes i ∈ V and can not be obtained by these
vnodes independently. To be fully distributed, we let each vnode i have its own qi and pk i, and add the
constraints (16-e) and (16-f) shown below that force all qi and pk i to be equal, respectively, for each vnode i.
In addition, because the object function minimizing q is equivalent to that minimizing |V | q2 or kc q2, where
|V | is also denoted by kc previously, and the object function of |V | q2 is equal to that of
∑
∀i∈V q

the constraint just mentioned above, qi = qj ,∀i, j ∈ V . Consequently, MLCLOP can be reformulated as the
following convex optimization problem:
minimize q2i (a)

p
k i ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ V, 1 ≤ k ≤ K (i)
rm ≥ TLm, 1 ≤ m ≤M (j)
In what follows, we proceed to use the primal-dual approach to develop our distributed algorithm with the
subgradient method. To this end, we note first that, apart from qi, the objective function in (16) involves no
p
k i that are also distributed variables to be locally solved, and the sum of these variables (i.e., the scheduling
length) would be simultaneously minimized by using its quadratic form (p2
k i
) along with the lifetime, for each
vnode i. Besides, for each link allocation variable fm{i,j}, which can be decided independently by its definition,
we also add a quadratic regularization term in the object function to eventually constitute a strict convex
programming problem. When taking all the above into account and using σ to denote the regularization factor,
we can approximate the optimization problem in (16) by
minimize q2i +

subject to the same constraints of (16), while (g) of that is replaced by
∑
1≤k≤K pk i ≤ 1
2) Subgradient-based Distributed Algorithm: Given the above, we can now formulate the subgradient-based
distributed algorithm operated in an iterative manner. Specifically, in each iteration k, each vnode i ∈ V will

More precisely, we conduct the master problem as a restricted version of MLCLOP, which considers only a
subset of available columns or transmission modes, rather than 2|E| such modes in total. That is, it uses only
a sub-matrix Ξo ⊂ Ξ with its index Ko ≤ K for this problem, and can be formulated as
[MASTER]: maximize T (21)
subject to the same constraints of (15), with Ξ now replaced by Ξo
1) Sub-problem: Given the master problem, we now need to identify whether its result can be re-optimized
by adding a new transmission mode to Ξo. Denoting the dual variables corresponding to constraint (15-c) by
w{i,j}, we suggest to find a transmission mode ξk that can maximize
∑
{i,j}∈E w{i,j}Rb{i,j}
Ei
e˜{i,j}
. The object
function is so conducted because Ei
e˜{i,j}
readily represents the lifetime of a link {i, j}, and the relay rate Rb{i,j}
would contribute an valid constraint for the session traffic on a link {i, j} when maximizing the lifetime.
Obviously, the object function is nonlinear. To linearize it, we simplify this function by considering that the
local transmit power, Pts, can be a fixed value sufficient for the ITA broadcast, and, ni, ∀i, can be chosen
a priori. Then, the transmit power for the relay transmission, Ptl, involved would be the variable for power
adaptation. Hence, we can approximate e˜{i,j} by Ptl, leading to the following maximization problem
max
 ∑
{i,j}∈E
w{i,j}Rb{i,j}Ei
Ptl
 (22)
However, the problem shown in above is still non-linear. Fortunately, we can use a logarithmic transformation
to reformulate it as a more tractable and equivalent linear problem as follows.
max
 ∑
{i,j}∈E
log(w{i,j}) + log(Rb{i,j}) + log(Ei)− log(Ptl)
 (23)
2) Power and Rate Adaptation Scheme: In this project, we consider that allowing a wireless sensor station
to transmit with arbitrary power and to conduct arbitrary data rate is impractical for implementation. In fact,
a realistic physical design for WSNs, e.g., the IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceiver examined in [23], can
support only several (8 in [23]) radio modes, and each mode is associated with a discrete transmit power.
Hence, it is more proper to consider that each vnode in the network supports only a number of power levels.
That is, a link {i, j} is only allowed to be active with a power level P pˆ ∈ {P 1, P 2, ..., P pˆmax}. Similarly,
it is only allowed to transmit with a relay rate level Rrˆ ∈ {R1, R2, ..., Rrˆmax}. To this end, we introduce
Boolean variable ypˆ{i,j} for the relay transmit power of a link {i, j}, having its value of 1 if it transmits at the
power level of pˆ, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, we introduce Boolean variable xrˆ{i,j} for the relay rate of a link
{i, j}, having its value of 1 if it transmits at the relay rate level of rˆ, and 0 otherwise. With these variables,
the discrete power and discrete rate (DPDR) transmission scheme can be formulated as the following binary
integer programming problem:

= 9}, and {s3 = 4, d3 = 9} with their traffic loads TL ≈ 22.56 Kbps as the session rates to be satisfied in
the MLCLOP optimization. With the few sections, we can clearly observe the behaviors of the cross-layer
optimization, instead of manipulating many sections with randomly deployed source-destination pairs that may
disturb the viewpoint. In fact, as shown in [16], even an approach along with a continuous power adaptation
would have exponential time complexity in the number of communication links, and computing exact solutions
is, in general, NP-hard. Here, in addition to the number of links, our MLCLOP-CG should also take into account
the discrete power and discrete rate adaptation, inevitably resulting in a more complex integer programming
problem of Sub-DPDR. Moreover, since we do not consider any restriction on SINR{i,j} for the link capacity,
the topology resulted actually corresponds to a fully connected network. Thus, for computation efficiency, we
demonstrate here at most eight power levels and eight data rates that are widely considered in the standards
such as IEEE 802.11a [26] and IEEE 802.15.4 [27]. This already yields 72 × 8 × 2 = 1152 binary integer
variables for the experiments and consumes a lot of computation time for a limited number of CG iterations.
Now two different sets for the experiments are so arranged by the combination of 4 and 8 power levels of
Ptl with 4 and 8 transmit data rates of Rb, as shown in Table III. In this table, RM ≈ 1.386 Mbps is given
by 0.8 times the maximum relay data rate obtainable in the network. Given that, 100 iterations of the column
generation (CG) in Sec. III-E are carried out for all the experiment instances. In addition to the proposed
methods, we examine also a TDMA-based optimization scheme, namely TDMA-LP, wherein a transmission
mode contains only a single link in the network, and every P pˆ is evaluated on each link {i, j} for obtaining
all possible Rrˆ’s in the latter. Obviously, TDMA-LP represents the optimal method in TDMA to compare
with our methods in STDMA within a reasonable time constraint. Figure 3 shows the optimization results
for the different methods, where (a) exhibits the results of 4 powers and 4 rates, (b) shows that of 4 powers
and 8 rates, and similarly, (c) and (d) demonstrate the results of 8 powers along with 4 rates and 8 rates,
respectively. In each subgraph, the top half exhibits the results of MLCLOP-CG and the bottom half shows
those of TDMA-LP, and in the third of each, the thickness of an arrow-line is used to represent its value of link
allocation resulted from the corresponding optimization. From this figure, we have the following observations.
First, due to the limited number of iterations, MLCLOP-CG has its performance results slightly different from
those of TDMA-LP. However, the trend of these results is the same. For example, given 4 powers and 4 rates,
figure 3(a) shows that both MLCLOP-CG and TDMA-LP tend to enjoy the highest rate (rate 4) with the

it is worth noting that as the number of rates remains 4 in the experiment, increasing the number of powers
from 4 to 8 can hardly increase the lifetime. That is to say, when simply increasing the transmit power without
correspondingly increasing the data rate, the energy consumption per bit for a link is not improved and the
lifetime is not increased as a result.
IV. PROJECT CONCLUSION
In this work, we have shown a cross-layer formulation to jointly address routing, link scheduling, and
rate control in such networks with the aim of finding the most energy-efficient scheduling that can maximize
the network lifetime while satisfying the end-to-end traffic demand for a set of source-destination pairs in
the wireless sensor networks with VMIMO-CB transmission. In particular, we have exhibited how the most
realistic model taking into account discrete power and discrete rate can be incorporated into our formulation.
This allows us to gain insights in the influence of discrete power/rate control, spatial reuse, routing strategy and
session load distribution on the network performance. Specifically, we have developed a specialized solution
based on linear programming along with a column generation approach that is represented by an integer
programming formulation, and demonstrated the approach in the computational examples within a reasonable
time constraint. In addition, we have developed a fully distributed algorithm using the Lagrangian duality and a
subgradient method to allow each node to independently obtain its own lifetime and scheduling variables. The
numerical experiment results readily showed that the proposed cross-layer optimization is capable on achieving
the network lifetime maximization, and on providing valuable viewpoints on the linear/convex programming-
based optimization and its distributed counterpart.

Abstract—In this paper, we study the problem of jointly max-
imizing network lifetime and data rate in wireless networks. For
this problem, we introduce a cross-layer formulation with general
NUM (network utility maximization) that accommodates routing,
scheduling and stream control from different layers of network
with relevant constraints. In particular, based on a lagrangian
approach, we extend our programming model to a distributed
algorithm that can dynamically approximate the optimal solution
to this problem. Finally, we present computational results to
confirm the benefits that can be gained from the cross-layer
optimization and the distributed algorithm.
I. INTRODUCTION
In this work, we present a cross-layer formulation that can
seamlessly integrate routing, scheduling and stream control
to solve the problem of jointly maximizing network lifetime
and data rate in wireless networks. As many related works,
the programming based formulation usually assumes that a
network controller can access to full parameters across the
whole network. Thus, we introduce here a lagrangian approach
along with the back-pressure scheduling and the log-sum-exp
approximation, to develop a distributed algorithm that can
get rid of the need of centralization and allow each node to
independently obtain its own scheduling and utility parameters
for the optimization. This approach has the merit that it is
not necessary to wait until the algorithm has converged before
transmission. In fact, based on the carrier sense multiple access
(CSMA) model in [1], we can apply this distributed algorithm
to the network we have at any time, optimal or otherwise, and
continue doing so while it converges. With the flexibility, it is
robust to network dynamics such as node mobility and channel
variation that would cause an optimal solution to change.
In the following, we first introduce our cross-layer non-
linear programming model in Section II. Then, we propose
the primal-dual distributed algorithm in Section III. Following
that, the cross-layer optimization is examined numerically in
Section IV. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.
II. THE CROSS-LAYER APPROACH FOR NETWORK
LIFETIME AND DATA RATE MAXIMIZATION
Inspired by the seminal works in [1]–[3] showing that
random access medium access controls (MACs) can actually
approach the system optimality without message passing, we
modify a CSMA MAC as the basis of our cross-layer design.
Based on that, we define transmission mode ξk ⊂ E as a
set of links that can be concurrently activated, and scheduling
matrix as an indexed collection of these modes, Ξ = {ξk},
where index k ∈ K = {1, ...,K}. In addition, we let p
k
specifying the possibility with which the transmission mode
ξk can happen be the scheduling variable, xs specifying the
data rate for session s ∈ S be the stream control variable,
and fsi,j specifying the amount of traffic of session s routed
through link {i, j} be the routing variable.
Abstractly, a wireless network is represented by G =
(V,E), and a session is denoted by its source node s ∈ S ⊂ V
transmitting packets to its destination node d ∈ D ⊂ V .
Besides, the initial energy of node i is denoted by Ei, and
the average energy spent by node i for its outgoing link {i, j}
scheduled by p
k
is denoted by eki,j . With the above, the lifetime
of node i can be estimated by Ti = Ei∑
j∈Ni
∑
s∈S
∑
k∈K e
k
i,jf
s
i,j
,
where Ni denotes its 1-hop neighbors, and further, the overall
lifetime of its network can be defined by TN = mini∈V Ti.
However, the network lifetime is hardly obtained with a
distributed algorithm because each node i or j involved should
independently converge to TNi = TNj , and in this work, it
should also converge to p
ki
= p
kj
, ∀i = j ∈ V, ∀k ∈ K. To
overcome this difficulty, instead of directly enforcing Ti (or
qi =
1
Ti
) to be the same as Tj (or qj), j ∈ Ni that is widely
considered in the related works such as [4], we adopt here
the concept of utility on resource allocation, and use the α-
fairness utility Ui of a node i as a function of its lifetime Ti,
as follows.
Ui(Ti) =
T 1−γi
1− γ =
qγ−1i
1− γ (1)
wherein qi = T−1i denotes the inverse lifetime of node i.
Resource allocation using the utility function is usually called
α-fair (or γ-fair here due to our notation) [5], which repre-
sents a general form helping us to approximate the network
lifetime. Specifically, we solve the sum of aggregated utility
maximization problem max
∑
i∈V Ui with respect to Ti (or
qi). Similarly, we adopt the log(xs) function widely used as
our data rate utility, and consider to solve the maximization
problem max
∑
s∈S Us with respect to xs. Now, let xis be
xs if i is the source of session s, −xs if i is the sink, and 0
otherwise, and let rki,j be the capacity of link {i, j} within ξk.
Given that, we can combine the utilities with a weight μ to
determine the effect of each part in the joint objective function,
relate the variables involved with the following constraints,
and finally formulate the lifetime and data rate maximization
                                                                                                                                          1395

(12)
wherein ηi, ζs, φi,s and ψi are positive constants and function
[b]+a is max(0, b) if a ≤ 0, and b if a > 0. Then, the sub-
gradient method is completed with the following back-pressure
scheduling algorithm that performs the scheduling calculation
for the session sources and MAC links involved.
B. Back-pressure Scheduling Algorithm
For the scheduling, a node i should decide, for each of its
links {i, j}, its target session by
s∗i,j = argmax
s∈S
[ui,s − uj,s]+ (13)
and the maximum differential backlog over link {i, j} by
ωi,j =
[
ui,s∗i,j − uj,s∗i,j
]
+
(14)
The above actually formulates a distributed scheduling algo-
rithm that uses back-pressure to equalize differential back-
log [8]. That is, after obtaining ωi,j , the corresponding source
node can generate and activate a timer T ki,j on its link {i, j} for
each transmission mode k to which {i, j} belongs, following
the exponential distribution with rate rki,j exp(β(rki,jωi,j −
eki,jvi)). Then, the node can determine T k
∗
i,j with k∗ =
argmink T
k
i,j among these timers. With this timer (T k
∗
i,j ), a
CSMA MAC such as that given in [1] can be adopted to
realized the distributed scheduling. Given the realization, it
would be also noted that the algorithm based on back-pressure
is not required to have a predefined set of routes. Instead, the
routing variables in our cross-layer design will be dynamically
and distributively decided by
f si,j =
{ ∑
k∈K pkr
k
i,j , if s = s∗i,j and ui,s − uj,s > 0
0, otherwise (15)
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
In this section, we report on numerical results for the
cross-layer optimization introduced previously. As shown in
Fig. 1(a), our simulation environment consists of 5 nodes and
12 directional links, along with 10 transmission modes listed in
Fig. 1(b). Specifically, to focus on the optimization framework
that is expected to be general enough, we do not consider a
particular physical layer and its energy consumption. Instead,
we assign rki,j and eki,j , ∀{i, j} ∈ E with a real number ∈ (0, 1)
to represent their possible values when normalized with respect
to a specific model, given the initial energy Ei = 1, ∀i ∈ V . In
addition, to explore the possibility that a link may be involved
in two or more transmission modes (such as link 1 in modes
1 and 2, and link 3 in modes 9 and 10, as shown in Fig. 1(b)),
we conduct the relevant parameters so that the time fractions

of these modes (p1, p2 , p9 and p10 ) are nonempty, for the two
sessions {s1 = A, d1 = E} and {s2 = E, d2 = A} involved.
Now, given the simulation environment, we naturally go
toward to examine the design parameters most relevant to the
cross-layer optimization scheme, including the weight for the
tradeoff between lifetime and data rate, μ, the parameter for
the lifetime utility, γ, the constant for the log-sum-exp approx-
imation, β, and the positive coefficients for the subgradient
algorithm, ζs, φi,s, and ψi. Specifically, their values for the
experiment instance are summarized in Table I. However, other
values not shown here have similar trends on the results. Now,
given these parameters, we compare the numerical results
with theoretically optimal values. Specifically, we first use a
centralized programming tool to solve (2) for obtaining the
optimal results on lifetime and data rate, T# and x#, as the
comparison basis. Then, we run the primal-dual subgradient
algorithm for 1000 iterations and collect the corresponding
results, T ∗ and x∗, to be numerically compared.
The results are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Table II.
Among these result representations, we shown in Fig. 2 that
the computed results of our two aims, i.e., the network lifetime
and the session data rate, are simultaneously depicted with
the curves properly converging to the two horizontal lines
representing the theoretical optimums. To be more specific,
in addition to the centralized results, the results with our
algorithm when terminating at the end of 1000 iterations
are also shown in Table II, which reveals the fact that the
differences between the computed results and the theoretical
optimums on the lifetime and the rate are actually small
enough, and within 0.44% and 2.10%, respectively. Note also
that unlike the lifetime T which is defined previously as a
single value as mini∈V Ti, the data rate x in fact involves
both session 1 and session 2. Thus, for each single session,
the difference on rate may be within 1.05% on average, which
is not far from that for the lifetime.
Finally, we pay our attention to the results obtained by
our distributed approach that is based on the log-sum-exp ap-
proximation. As mentioned previously, without the treatment,
the MWIS problem under consideration will be NP-hard and
so difficult to be approximated even in a centralized way.
Fortunately, our formulation derived in Sec. III can lead us to
AMP and by solving this problem with (9) we can obtain the
optimal solutions p∗k to the approximated problem. It can be
readily seen in Fig. 3 that when compared with the centralized
optimums, p#k , our optimal solutions, p∗k, have very similar
values, which confirms the correctness of our derivation.
