design knowledge. The purpose of this project is to 
extend the knowledge representation abilities of our 
design case library, which will lead to the 
development of a knowledge base for smart tools 
assisting architectural design. 
The tangible results of this study are as follows: 
1. Encoding spatial ontology: The study proposes a 
graphic interface for encoding spatial ontology, 
which will assist designers to represent their 
semantic knowledge when analyzing design cases.  
2. Bridging spatial topology and semantic ontology: 
Extending previous results concerning encoding 
spatial topology, this study bridges two kinds of 
design knowledge representation, namely semantic 
ontology and spatial ontology, and automatically 
collects and establishes the mapping relationship 
between two kinds of knowledge representations.  
3. Implementation of the SSO system: Improving the 
interface of the previous TPM system with semantic 
annotation, the SSO system integrates the ’semantic 
ontology authoring’ and ’spatial topology 
encoding’ interfaces, allowing the encoding of case 
design knowledge within the CBA case library. 
4. Preliminary tests: The SSO system was provided to 
teachers and the project assistant for preliminary 
testing of the encoding of design cases. It was found 
that the SSO system could only encode knowledge of 
interior spaces, and could not easily encode the 
contexts between buildings and their sites. Further 
investigation is needed to determine how to deal with 
knowledge at different spatial levels within a design 
case. 
Through the implementation of the SSO system, this 
project integrated two knowledge representation 
tools: ’semantic ontology’ and ’spatial 
ontology,’ established their mapping relationships, 
and improved encoding efficiency. This project‘s 
knowledge base can provide a foundation for the 
development of smart architectural design tools, and 
remedy the shortcomings of existing BIM systems when 
representing architectural design knowledge.

Smart Spatial Ontology: Bridging Semantic Ontology to Spatial Topology

ABSTRACT 
 
This paper proposes a feasible approach named “Smart Spatial Ontology” for 
converting ontological declarations into topological relations and geometric features, 
which would then assist users to retrieve relevant cases from the case library. The 
purpose of this project is to extend the knowledge representing abilities of our design 
case library, which develops smart retrieval of spatial topology within plan drawings 
for assisting architectural design. 
 
Keywords: case-based design; case library; spatial topology; semantic ontology.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Case libraries are usually implemented using relational database technology, which requires selecting 
the most specific common features of the cases. The selected explicit features serve as the index 
mechanism of the case library. However, an index mechanism that uses explicit features often 
overlooks the acquisition, re-indexing, and generalization of the implicit knowledge of cases, such as 
the representation of spatial topologies and semantic associations among physical components and 
vacant spaces. 
Eastman proposed the building product model (BPM), which consisted of three types of 
information: semantic, topological, and geometric information [4]. Eastman’s insight also initiated 
research on the building information model (BIM), which is applied in modern computer aided 
architectural design (CAAD) tools and is widely adopted in the architecture, engineering, and 
construction (AEC) fields. However, most implementations of BIM still lack the necessary information 
model for storing spatial topology, as well as representing and retrieving design information of spatial 
topology. On the other hand, it is usually difficult to collect the complete BIM files of an important 
precedent to store into a case library, and it is unnecessary to rebuild the BIM files of a design case for 
applying case-based design. Hence, the unstructured information of design cases, such as the scanned 
images of design drawings, are usually easily collected and stored into a case library. The implicit 
information of the unstructured files, such as semantic, topological, and geometric information of 
building spaces, usually cannot be indexed and retrieved. 
This project is a follow-up study of two previous projects named “Spatial Topology Retrieval 
(STR)” [12] and “Open Case Study (OCS).” [11] Using previous research results, such as the interactive 
encoding and retrieving tools of spatial topology, and the classified design patterns detected by data 
mining algorithms, this project introduces semantic ontology approaches into the case library for 
establishing the semantic associations among physical components and vacant spaces. Based on the

However, spatial topology usually is only the representation of explicit features of how spaces 
were composed in a plan drawing rather than the implicit design knowledge of why those spaces 
should be composed in that way in the plan drawing. For example, an architect may convert the 
“service” association between dinning room and living room into connective or combining topology, 
but the “service” association is not the only predicate that a learner of the design case can infer 
reversely from connective or combining topology. The opening interpretation of spatial topology 
means that design cases involved have the potential to be reused for different situations, but also 
blocks the efficient indexation of implicit knowledge behind the spatial topology and the effective 
association with designer’s concepts. Therefore, a formal declaration of the conversion from semantic 
association to spatial topology is necessary for indexing, retrieval, and reuse of implicit design 
knowledge behind spatial topology, and ontology-based mechanism should be one of the most 
plausible approaches. 
2.2 Semantic Ontology of Design Knowledge 
Ontology is a knowledge engineering technique and a data model to facilitate knowledge sharing and 
reusing. A knowledge chunk in an ontology can be represented by a triple set of “subject,” “predicate,” 
and “object” [6]. The “predicate” presents the semantic relation among knowledge objects, and 
determines how an intelligent agent reasons with and validates an ontology by first order logic or 
other formal logic. Therefore, the declaration of a “predicate” means linking knowledge objects by 
causal or semantic relations. Whether for artifical intellegence [6, 7] or philosophy, the meaning of an 
ontology usually implies that contents and structures of a concept are fixed and static to keep them 
correct and consistent in a knowledge domain. However, this constraint may satisfy most domains 
except the design industry. 
As education scholars declare, “designers reason from cases, not from principles.” Designers are 
educated to transform or interpret cases, not directly imitate precedents [1]. Although most geometric 
and topological information of building components and spaces should be fixed and static within built 
precedents, the interpretation of a built precedence still may change with the times and technology. 
Even old cases can still inspire solutions for new issues such as green building design. For example, an 
architect may quote the “Villa Savoye” by Le Corbusier as an energy-saving solution because he 
recognizes the energy-saving features of the stilt style building and the roof garden within the case. 
Therefore, design knowledge usually is flexible and varied with design situations, and not easy to 
formalize into a common and shared ontology. 
Based on Gruber’s definition, an ontology should be “a formal, explicit specification of a shared 
conceptualizations [7].” But architects usually are educated and encouraged to challenge existing 
specifications of conceptualizations in their domain, and may not like to share their design concepts 
before they won competitions. Nevertheless, when users of a case library found some new but implicit 
features of cases, a formal and explicit ontology still is very useful for indexing, retrieving, 
representing, and reusing their recognitions. In the previous study, an adaptable and extendable 
ontology-based annotation system named “Open Ontology” [10] was therefore established to formalize 
the metadata of a house design case library named OCS [11] (Fig. 2). However, the “predicate” classes 
of Open Ontology are very simple and only four types of semantic associations, which are of “same-
as,” “is-a,” “hold-by/has,” and “part-of” relations based on WordNet [5]. Therefore, this project 
improves the metadata-authoring tool of OCS, and bridges the semantic ontology to spatial topology 
for assisting in reusing design cases. 
2.3 Bridging Semantic Ontology to Spatial Topology 
The “semantic ontology” of building components and spaces is a kind of declarative knowledge. 
However, any representation of declarative knowledge usually involves some kinds of bias of the 
knowledge holders [2]. Therefore, the “predicate” classes of spatial topology should be kept open and 
allow users to expand and modify the thesaurus based on their recognitions. As the STR allows users 
to annotate spatial topology on a plan drawing, SSO allows users to freely annotate a semantic 
association between a spatial topology and existing metadata in Open Ontology. However, the four 
basic semantic associations of Open Ontology still can help implement the self-organizing ability of an

5 
situations. Therefore, SSO applies a bottom-up approach and implements intuitive and graphic 
manipulations of spatial ontology, which are extended from the STR’s interface. Based on the self-
organizing ability of four basic associations in Open Ontology, SSO assists users to annotate their 
recognitions of spatial topology in a plan drawing of house cases. Fig. 3 demonstrates the STR-based 
visual interface of SSO, which can directly encode semantic ontology on a topological layout of a house 
plan drawing in OCS.

over a house plan image, (b) the visualization of spatial topologies among spaces. 
3.3 Primary Evaluation of Smart Spatial Ontology 
To efficiently store, index and retrieve design cases, the classification of design case features is critical 
for developing a case library. Yet, researchers have argued that: (1) classification of case features is 
meaningful and useful only with respect to a specific purpose at hand; (2) but how a designer 
recognizes the features of a case is a function of their personal experiences, (3) therefore useful 
characteristics of cases usually cannot be known in advance [3]. Therefore, an interpretative tool, 
which can assist users to represent their personal recognitions, should be more helpful than a prior 
and static mechanism of classifications for helping users to study existing or new cases. 
Freely textural annotations such as tags of popular Web 2.0 sites are simple, efficient, and user-
friendly means for indexing and retrieval of unstructured information. However, ill-organized tags 
cannot avoid confusing problems of design knowledge representation, and usually are not formalized 
enough to implement a software agent for automatic processes. Therefore, SSO has three advantages 
than other approaches: (1) the triple set of a knowledge chunk as the prior data structure in assisting 
users to efficiently organize design knowledge of spatial topology, (2) the basic four semantic 
associations, and (3) predefined knowledge classes in the Open Ontology as the prior inference 
mechanism in assisting implementing a software agent which can automatically organize relevant 
spatial topology. 
4 DISCUSSIONS 
Design knowledge representation of cases is the major bottleneck of applying CBD and CBR in the field 
of architectural design. However, most approaches usually overlook formal representation of design 
knowledge within architectural design cases, and ignore the assistance for representing personal 
recognitions of users. For architectural precedents before BIM development, useful design information

However, the validation algorithm is too simple to automatically solve all conflicts when a user 
encodes spatial topology. On the other hand, the SSO interface provides intuitive indicator, immediate 
response, and visual reminder for dealing with conflicts, thus assisting users in solving conflicts and 
validating their assignments of spatial topology. Although the possible spatial topologies are limited, 
highly varied representations of spatial geometry maintain highly reuse of design cases. However, the 
efficiency of the validating algorithm has been proven in prior studies, therefore SSO still saves time of 
revising topological assignments and geometric modification of spaces. 
4.3 Spatial Geometry vs. Spatial Ontology 
Smart Geometry is the technique that uses computing rules to generate complex architectural 
components, which are difficult to produce and control by traditional methods. However, present 
CAAD tools have paid too much attention to coordinating the physical geometry of architectural 
components, with insufficient considerations in recognizing and converting between semantic 
ontology and spatial topology of architectural design. Hence, users are able to implement complex 
building forms in BIM, but cannot check a space within a project regardless of whether the 
requirements of the building program are satisfied. It is necessary to build a tool to check whether the 
topology and geometric information of spaces satisfy the declarations of the building program. Hence, 
SSO of this study devotes to building the bridge between three types of design information. 
The ontology in SSO not only assists the geometric validation of spatial topology, but also bridges 
semantic ontology to topology and geometric information. For validating the ontology, a semantic 
association bridges a spatial topology with a known class in Open Ontology. Hence, SSO represents the 
design knowledge of a spatial topology then assists users of the case library in indexing and retrieving 
relevant cases by semantic associations. For example, a user is able to annotate a “has-a → view” 
association selected from existing annotations of “opening” topology on the “living room → opening → 
a lake” topology in the Douglas House by Richard Meier, and help other users to retrieve by the query 
of “living room → has-a → view.” Based on the prototype of SSO, it is possible to make BIM tool 
smarter by implementing spatial topology and geometry using smart spatial ontology.  
5 CONCLUSIONS 
The development of an ontology usually focuses on the formal representation of domain knowledge 
for sharing or reusing by humans or software agents. However, the shared degree of 
conceptualizations usually decreases with the scope of the domain experts. For example, clients of 
different cultures or architects of different design studios may not hold the same design concepts 
about how to assess spatial topology. Therefore, the development of SSO dose not attempt to 
implement a complete tool of authoring spatial ontology, but extend the knowledge representing 
ability of OCS by bridging the classes of Open Ontology to the spatial topology of STR with semantic 
associations. For avoiding confusing and un-formalized problems of free annotations, the basic four 
semantic associations of Open Ontology can assist the OCS library to automatically organize spatial 
ontology annotated by users.  
However, since there are fewer possible spatial topologies than common semantic associations 
and relevant knowledge classes, it was found that the translation of semantic ontologies to spatial 
topologies should be a convergent process. On the contrary, the semantic interpretations and 
geometric translations of spatial topologies usually become open and divergent [9]. Therefore, spatial 
topology plays a critical bridge in the information processing of “semantic ontology → topological 
relation → geometric feature” of spatial layouts in early design stages. However, how this type of 
information processing will appear in different stages of architectural design still need more 
investigations.
