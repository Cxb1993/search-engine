be devised for those basic methods to reduce 
the numerical diffusion, in particular, the 
so-called high resolution schemes with some 
flux limiters. The above mentioned gas-kinetic 
Euler solvers are also of first order accuracy in 
space and possess some upwinding properties, 
i.e., in accordance with the characteristic wave 
propagation property and capture the gas 
dynamical discontinuities correctly although 
rather diffusively. Normally, high-order 
methods can be devised for the basic first-order 
methods to yield good computational tools for 
practical problems.

where m is the particle mass, U is the 
externally applied mean field and f is the 
distribution function which represents the 
average density of particles with momentum p 
at the space-time point x, t. The (δf /δt) 
collision denotes the collision term. In recent 
years, the development of numerical methods 
for solving the quantum Boltzmann equation 
has become an active research subject [7, 8]. A 
recent review on the numerical methods for the 
dynamics and transport of atomic quantum 
gases has been given [9]. Here, we consider 
only the lowest order (first approximation) of 
solution of the above Boltzmann equation and

where θ=+1 denotes the Fermi-Dirac statistics 
and θ=-1 the Bose-Einstein statistics. To 
complete the equilibrium solution we have to 
determine the five unknown functions T, µ, and 
u, which appear in Eq.(3). These five flow 
parameters can be determined by making use of 
the five conservation laws for number of 
particles, momentum, and energy.  These five 
conservation laws are obtained by multiplying 
Eq. (1}) by 1, p, or p2/2m, and then integrating 
the resulting equations over all p.   The 
integrals of the collision terms in all three cases 
vanish automatically and we have the 
differential conservation laws for the conserved 
macroscopic quantities, i.e., the particle number 
density n, the momentum density, J=m j, and 
the energy density, ε as follows:

The Quantum Kinetic Beam Scheme 
The beam scheme is presented by Sanders and 
Prendergast [2], and the scheme is used for 
solving the equilibrium limit of the classical 
Boltzmann equation. The derivation was based 
on the local thermodynamic equilibrium 
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Later in [10], 
the concept of beam scheme of Sanders and 
Prendergast was successfully extended to 
relativistic Boltzmann transport equation based 
on the J¨uttner distribution. In two spatial 
dimensions, the local equilibrium solution eq. 
(3) can be approximated as five discrete delta 
functions

Quantum Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting 
Scheme 
In this section, the basic first-order kinetic flux 
vector splitting scheme is derived based on the 
convectional Boltzmann equation at the gas 
evolution stage. We consider the problems in 
one spatial dimension in which the 
macroscopic quantities are assumed to be 
function of x and t. Divide the space into a 
number of cells. Each cell occupies a small 
space [xj−1/2, xj+1/2], where j + 1/2 denotes 
the cell interface between cells j and j + 1, and 
the cell center is located at xj . With the initial 
mass, momentum and energy densities given 
inside each cell j, ( ), ,j j j j j jW Uρ ρ ρ ε=   (19)

and WR= (7.768344, 0, 0.375085) for 0.5 < x < 
1. We assume µL = µR and set the values of 
fugacity as zL = 0.99 and zR = 0.98 which are 
quite close to unity. The results are output at 
time t = 0.3 (dimensionless time) and the CFL 
number used is 1. The computed density, 
temperature, fugacity, and chemical potential 
profiles are depicted in Fig. 2 for several grid 
systems. The symbol □ denotes the solution

1. This corresponds to zL = 0.8 and zR = 0.7 and 
we assume that µL = µR and m = 1. The 
solution behaviors are similar to that in 
classical limit. The results are output at time t = 
0.15 (dimensionless time) and the CFL number 
used is 1. The computed density, temperature, 
fugacity, and chemical potential profiles are

and WR= =(3.084468, 0, 8.067159) for 0.5 < x 
< 1. We assume µL = µR and set the values of 
fugacity as zL = 2000 and zR = 1500, using 
Sommerfeld expansion to get fermi function. 
The results are output at time t = 0.1 
(dimensionless time) and the CFL number used 
is 1. The computed density, temperature, 
fugacity, and chemical potential profiles are 
depicted in Fig. 4 for several grid systems.The

Example 5 
We take the shock wave diffraction with ideal 
quantum gases as the two dimension example. 
Example 5 shows the diffraction for bose gas, 
and Example 6 for Fermi gas. These cases are 
performed by quantum kinetic beam scheme. 
The one-dimensional case can be found in [11]. 
We consider a plane shock wave located 
initially at a certain distance ahead of the 
circular cylinder that propagates with shock 
Mach number Ms = 2.0 toward the cylinder and 
experiences transient shock diffraction. For the 
classical gas, an experimental study has been 
given in [12] and a detailed numerical 
simulation has been reported in [13]. A simple
