Abstract 
In this paper, the input traffic model of Direct 
Sequence-Code Division Multiple Access (DS 
CDMA)/Unslotted ALOHA network adopts the Markov 
Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). MMPP model is 
capable of capturing and characterizing the 
multimedia traffic property. Furthermore, the 
throughput performance of DS CDMA/Unslotted 
ALOHA network is controlled by MMPP model. The 
simulation results show that the throughput 
performance of MMPP model is different from that of 
Poisson model. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The Direct Sequence-Code Division Multiple 
Access (DS CDMA) technology has been adopted in 
related packet radio communication network. This is 
because DS CDMA can provide random access 
capability and high throughput performance. DS 
CDMA network combines with unslotted ALOHA 
protocol that can control a packet to transmit at any 
time, so it has asynchronous property. Although DS 
CDMA /unslotted ALOHA network has asynchronous 
property, it affects the throughput performance. The 
impact of asynchronous property on throughput 
performance of the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA 
network has been investigated in earlier studies 
[1][2][3]. 
However, earlier studies [1][2][3] for the DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA network assume the input 
traffic model is a Poisson arrival process. Note that 
Poisson arrival process is one in which the inter-arrival 
times are an exponential distribution and has 
independent property. In practice, Poisson arrival 
process is not suited to multimedia traffic source model. 
The multimedia traffic has bursty features, and its 
time-varying arrival rates capture some of the 
important correlations between inter-arrival times. 
In this paper, we study the throughput performance 
of the DS CDMA/unslotted ALOHA network, but the 
input traffic model is a Markov Modulated Poisson 
Process (MMPP) [4]. MMPP can model arrival process 
with certain bursty features and has been applied to 
ATM input traffic modeling [5] [6][7][8]. Furthermore, 
we evaluate the throughput performance of the DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA network when the input 
traffic model is a MMPP model to account for 
multimedia input traffic. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In 
Section II, the system model is presented. In Section III, 
the Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) as 
input traffic model is introduced. The simulation results 
are given in Section Ⅳ. Section Ⅴ is the conclusion. 
 
2. System Model 
 
An unslotted -ALOHA network with packet length 
L[bits] is considered in a single-carrier DS CDMA 
system with processing gain N. This network consists 
of a single hub station and finite number of the users. 
When the transmitted packet is interfered with level 
k in an asynchronous DS CDMA network, the bit error 
probability Pb(k),k 0, is given by simplified ≧
improved Gaussian approximation [9].

with 
simulated results clearly shows that the bursty traffic 
affects the throughput performance and lead to 
different result 
between Poisson arrival process and MMPP, even if 
they have the same offered load and the same average 
arrival rate. In Fig.2, the MMPP with α = 0.001, β = 
0.005, λ1= 100 λ0 and 50 users is considered. 
According to (7), the λ1 gets large quantity in short 
sojourn time and causes large MAI. Consequently, the 
throughput performance of MMPP model is lower than 
that of Poisson process. On the other hand, the MMPP 
with α=0.5, β=0.01, λ1= 0, and 50 users is shown in Fig. 
3. Due to α>β and (6), the steady-state probability of 
state 1 of the two-state MMPP, which has no arrival 
rate and no MAI, is larger than that of state 0. The 
throughput performance of MMPP is higher than that 
of Poisson arrival process. Moreover, Fig.4 and Fig. 5 
illustrate the effect of 500 users on the throughput 
performance. The throughput performance of MMPP is 
the same as Poisson arrival process. Therefore the 
assumption of Poisson arrival process may 
overestimate the throughput performance of the DS 
CDMA/unslotted ALOHA network. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
 The two-state Markov Modulated Poisson 
Process (MMPP) is applied to the input traffic model of 
DS CDMA/Unslotted ALOHA network and can 
capture the nature of multimedia traffic. The results
