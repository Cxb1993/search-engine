Before the 18th century, all clothing 
was hand-made to order based on the 
customer’s body shape. Professional tailors 
developed knowledge about the bone 
structure, growth pattern of body parts and 
the clearance required for ease of movement. 
Tailors measured the body dimensions of 
each customer, and then drew and cut 
patterns. This approach produced clothes 
that fit well, but were only appropriate for 
individuals whose body dimensions had 
been measured. After many original patterns 
had been accumulated, the tailors discovered 
correlations between bodily dimensions, 
irrespective of the individual differences. 
Tailors gradually developed patterns into a 
sizing catalog, which could be used to make 
clothes for people with similar body shapes 
[2, 3]. In related studies, Tryfos [22] 
proposed an integer programming technique 
for classifying sizes to maximize expected 
sales; McCulloch et al. [19] proposed a 
non-linear optimization approach for 
deriving a set of sizes; Chang and Shen [4] 
applied multivariate analysis to establish 
body measurement charts for females from 
18 to 22. Laing et al. [18] used statistical 
analysis to establish body measurement 
charts for protective clothing used by New 
Zealand firemen. Moon and Nam [20] 
measured the anthropometric data of 349 
Korean females aged over 60 to classify 
lower trunk body shapes. Gupta and 
Gangadhar [9] used a statistical model to 
establish body measurement charts for 
young Indian females; and Hsu and Wang 
[12] established systems for using a decision 
tree technique for determining the sizes of 
army soldiers. Additionally, Hsu et al. [13] 
determined the body shapes for developing 
female size charts by using data mining. 
According to the practice of clothing 
making, bust girth and waist girth are the 
most important anthropometric variable for 
developing body measurement charts [8, 11, 
12, 13, 23, 24]. Body measurement charts 
can be established by using various 
approaches, and these charts are often 
similar across many countries. Some sizing 
charts classify body shape according to girth 
difference based on anthropometric data; for 
example, China, England, France, Germany, 
Japan, Korea, the USA, and Taiwan [5, 7, 8, 
16, 23]. Many clothing sizing approaches 
have used the differences between bust girth 
and waist girth to determine body shapes for 
developing body measurement charts. 
However, these body shapes cannot be 
accurately classified based on girth 
difference alone [25, 26]. Taking the body 
measurement charts (CNS 12659-L4160) 
used in Taiwan as an example, female body 
shapes were classified according to the 
differences between bust girth and waist 
girth. Different female body shapes were 
classified as shown in Table 1. 
 
Table 1. Female body shapes of CNS 
12659-L4160 
Body shape Girth difference 
A   6.0cm≦X＜10.0cm 
B 10.0cm≦X＜14.0cm 
C 14.0cm≦X＜18.0cm 
D 18.0cm≦X＜22.0cm 
 
Although female body shapes were 
classified, it is not quite reasonable to 
determine body shapes based on the girth 
difference. The following takes two 
Taiwanese females as an example:  
Number 1：155cm (stature), 66cm (bust girth) 
and 54cm (waist girth). 
Number 2：175cm (stature), 104cm (bust 
girth) and 92cm (waist girth). 
 
According to these classified rules (CNS 
12659-L4160), the differences between the 
bust and waist girths are 12cm for both 
women. Both fall into the “B” figure shape, 
though their figures are significantly 
different. The first woman has an undersized 
figure with smaller bust and waist; the 
second is tall with a larger bust and waist. 
Furthermore, the bust-to-waist ratios tell a 
different story: for Number 1 the ratio is 1.2, 
while that of Number 2 is 1.1. Clearly 
bust-to-waist girth difference is different 
from bust-to-waist girth ratio. This analysis 
indicated that such a simple range of girth 
5 
detect the structure of the 
relationships among variables, factor 
analysis was conducted to identify 
the most critical factors which can 
form the foundation for classifying 
the population. 
Phase 2: Based on the results of phase 1 the 
first classification into categories of 
population was performed based on 
the critical factor. 
Phase 3: These categories were further 
subdivided on the basis of the other 
critical factor for classifying the 
body shapes.  
Phase 4: The new body measurement charts 
for facilitating clothing manufacture 
were developed using the classified 
body shapes. 
 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1 Factor Analysis 
 
It would be highly complex task to 
use a total of 12 anthropometric variables 
for the development of body measurement 
charts; therefore, the most critical factors 
were identified first via factor analysis to 
simplify this task. Factor analysis obtained 
the eigenvalues of the 12 anthropometric 
variables. Two factors with eigenvalues 
exceeding 1 were chosen according to the 
eigenvalue criterion of Kaiser. Consequently, 
anthropometric variables, with factor 
loadings of greater than 0.5, were found to 
be clustered within Factors 1 and 2, as 
shown in Table 2.

* Factor loading > 0.5 
 
The first two factors, which 
comprised 81.7 percent of the total variance, 
were identified. The anthropometric 
variables concentrated within Factor 1 were 
interior bust width, posterior bust width, 
bust girth, waist girth, hip girth, neck girth, 
upper arm girth and wrist girth; those in 
Factor 2 included stature, sleeve length, 
back length, and front length. Therefore, two 
critical factors were thus identified, with 
Factor 1 being named the girth factor and 
Factor 2 the height factor. 
These findings provide the important 
framework for the development of body 
measurement charts. The results of the factor 
analysis listed in Table 2 demonstrate that 
the top two anthropometric variables most 
closely correlated with the girth factor were 
bust girth and waist girth. Because bust girth 
and waist girth are also the most important 
anthropometric variables in clothing making 
[7, 16], they were chosen to represent the 
girth factor. In addition, stature was 
correlated with all height related 
anthropometric variables and was selected to 
represent the height factor. 
Based on these results the first 
classification of population was performed 
on the basis of stature (Height factor). 
Height was subdivided into three subclasses. 
The stature categories were then further 
subdivided based on the bust girth and waist 
girth (Girth factor) to classify the body 
shapes. Girth was subdivided into four 
subclasses.

since it increases the costs of clothing 
manufacture. Therefore, out of the 526 
samples, 16 samples were excluded. Finally, 
nine body measurement charts in this study 
more than 2% have been proposed. Table 5 
lists a representative body measurement 
chart for the average stature-medium bust 
body shape with eight size groups.  
In addition to body measurement 
charts being developed based on the 
professional judgment of women’s clothing 
experts, the numbers in every size group for 
all of the body measurement charts were 
also decided based on the aggregate loss of 
fit.  
The aggregate loss was employed as a 
measure of clothing fit in developing new 
body measurement charts. An optimal body 
measurement chart containing a given 
number of sizes is defined as a chart that 
minimizes aggregate loss. In such a body 
measurement chart the average of the 
Euclidean distance of individuals from their 
size is minimized. Therefore, the chart can 
provide the better fit [2, 19].  
The straight-line distance between any 
two points is known as the Euclidean 
distance. The Euclidean distance in a 
p –dimensional space is given by

Where aj and bj are coordinates of points A 
(actual value) and B (assigned value in this 
study) for j th axis representing the j th 
dimension [10]. Consequently, the aggregate 
loss was performed in this study by using 
the Euclidean distance divided by the 
number of individuals in each size group. 
The ideal value for aggregate loss of fit can 
be calculated using the number of body 
dimensions considered –allowing for 
2.54cm deviation of the body dimension 
from the assigned size [9]. Thus, the 
aggregate loss was calculated using two 
control dimensions (bust girth and waist 
girth) in this study. The ideal value for 
aggregate loss of fit in each size group 
would be 2 2[(2.54) (2.54) ]+ , that is 3.59cm. 
Taking the body measurement chart 
based on average stature-medium bust body 
shape as an example, eight size groups were 
determined according to the aggregate loss 
of all size groups being less than 3.59, as 
shown in Table 5. The size groups in other 
body measurement charts exhibit results and 
the values obtained are less than the ideal 
value for the aggregate loss of fit. 
Furthermore, the values obtained for nine 
body measurement charts were also less than 
the ideal value. Thus, new body 
measurement charts are more 
accommodating.  
Based simultaneously on the 
judgment of clothing experts and the 
aggregate loss of fit, the number of size 
groups could be accurately determined, 
ensuring that the new body measurement 
chart achieved optimal fit. Additionally, 
there were 11 individuals with extreme size 
that were excluded by deciding the numbers 
for each size group. A total of nine body 
measurement charts including 35 size

Four female body shapes were obtained 
using the bust-to-waist girth ratio approach, and 
new body measurement charts were developed, 
according to the judgments of clothing experts 
and aggregate loss of fit. The newly developed 
body measurement charts were found to have 
the following desirable characteristics. 
 
(1) Regular ratios to classify body shapes  
 
Clothing manufacturers can easily 
understand the relationships between bust girth 
and waist girth and identify different body 
shapes using the regular ratios contained in the 
body measurement charts. The girth ratio 
approach also provides a more reasonable and 
convenient identification of body shapes to 
facilitate clothing manufacture. Furthermore, the 
fact that the bust-to-waist girth ratio for each 
body shape has equal and constant dimensional 
units and these average differences are 
advantageous for pattern making, pattern 
grading, marker making, cutting and sewing 
during the clothing manufacturing process.  
 
(2) Production reference points to facilitate 
clothing manufacture  
 
Clothing manufacturers can obtain 
detailed pattern making information by referring 
to these body measurement charts based on nine 
body shapes. Taking the 88cm bust girth of an 
average stature-medium bust body shape as an 
example (Table 5), it can be seen that a bust 
girth of 88cm matches up with a waist girth of 
74cm, stature of 158cm, sleeve length of 51cm, 
back length of 40cm, front length of 43cm, 
interior bust width of 36cm, posterior bust width 
of 32cm, hip girth of 93cm, neck girth of 32cm, 
upper arm girth of 26cm and wrist girth of 14cm; 
consequently these precise body measurement 
charts can be used by designers and pattern 
makers to produce clothing patterns. The 
percentages of Taiwanese females with every 
particular body shape and size was also recorded 
in the body measurement charts, which can help 
achieve more accurate materials control and 
production planning for the specific Taiwanese 
marketplace.  
In addition, these developed body 
measurement charts used new size labels as a 
reference based on ISO rules [14]. The new size 
labels can be used as a communication tool 
among clothing designers, pattern makers, 
manufacturers, retailers and consumers. After 
appropriate orientation, females may easily and 
quickly find suitable clothing, because size 
labels communicate important size information 
and thus enable them to use the new size labels 
to accurately identify clothing that will fit 
specific body shapes. For example, 92MA 
indicates bust girth of 92cm, body shape 
“Medium bust”, and stature “Average”.  
 
(3) Few size groups and high coverage rate  
 
The body measurement charts had a high 
coverage rate of 94.87%. These nine body 
measurement charts include 35 sizing 
accommodation groups –fewer sizes than for 
any other country [8, 15, 17, 23]. In practice, 
clothing manufacturers wish to minimize the 
number of sizes, since numerous sizes can cause 
excessive inventory, and may encumber cash 
flow. In addition, they also like a high coverage 
rate to improve mass production to reduce costs 
[1, 16].
