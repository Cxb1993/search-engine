The TFT performance varies with time for the TFT thickness of 50 nm active channel layer, 
while it is fairly stable for TFTs with the thicker layers, as shown in Fig. 2. From these transfer 
curves, the major change is located at the off-on transition region due to its low drain-source 
current level. The effect is mainly caused by the change of humidity and the mechanism is 
explained by Fig. 3. In humid environment, water molecules cause fixed positive charges at 
surface. These positive charges induce compensating negative charges which form conducting 
back channel in the a-Si:H layer and provide additional conduction path. As a result, conductance, 
on-current and off-current all increase. This effect shows up more significantly in the off region 
because of conductivity is much smaller in dark environment [7]. The other possibility is that 
water molecules cause defects inside a-Si:H; however, this could be excluded because the 
observed phenomena is reversible [5]. 
Figure 4 shows the operational temperature dependent stability. Raising the temperature 
from 20 oC (293 K) to 55 oC (328 K), the threshold voltage drops about 4 V, which is mainly 
caused by the thermal excitation of carriers. The on-current increases about 30 pA, while 
off-current increases about one order of magnitude, caused by the thermal excitation of carriers 
added in the off-regime [6]. 
We further applied gate-bias stressing on TFTs at elevated temperature. The shift of 
threshold voltage is plotted against accumulated stressing time as shown in Fig. 5(a). Plotting the 
data points taken at the accumulated stressing time of 1850 sec, the corresponding Arrhenius plot 
is shown in Fig. 5(b). It shows a clear saturation of threshold voltage shift around 50 oC~70 oC. 
Around the same temperature, there is also an abrupt increase of gate leakage current [6]. 
The shift of threshold voltage of a-Si:H TFTs under the influence of gate bias stressing are 
caused by two mechanisms: (1) charge trapping in SiNx mainly through tunneling, and (2) 
creation of metastable dangling bonds in the a-Si:H channel near the gate dielectric [8-11]. The 
former happens at low gate bias electrical field and the later happens at high gate bias. Combined 
the analyses of temperature dependency of gate leakage current and thermoelectric stressing bias, 
we conclude that the release of trapped charges around 50~60 oC inside dielectric at elevated 
temperature are responsible for the saturation phenomena. These trapped charges thermionically 
emitted into the active layers, contributing to the abrupt increase of gate leakage currents. Since 
the shift of threshold voltage is caused by the trapped charges insides dielectrics, which screen 
out the penetration of electrical field during TFT operation. Therefore, the release of trapped 
charges also eases the threshold voltage shift under gate bias stressing. The defect levels, where 
trapped electrons are released from, are around 30 meV below the conduction band edge [6]. 
For the usage of a-Si:H TFTs on plastics, it can be pre-stressed to improve the stability. 
On-plastic amorphous silicon thin film transistors can be applied at a temperature of 50 oC as 
driving circuit devices for microfluidic chips.

We investigated the temperature-dependent stability on the inverted-staggered back-channel-etched
a-Si:H thin film transistors TFTs made at a process temperature of 150 °C on plastic foil

processed TFTs show an abnormal saturation of Vt at 50 °C 323 K in a constant gate-bias stress
experiment. Around the same temperature, we observed abrupt increases in both the gate leakage
current and the off current. Because of the low process temperature, the gate dielectric is less stable
and more defective compared to that made at high process temperatures. A substantial amount of
charges, trapped inside the dielectric during TFT fabrication and gate-bias stressing, was
thermionically emitted into the channel by the Poole–Frenkel emission mechanism at a stressing

I. INTRODUCTION
Despite the rapid development of organic electronics and
metal-oxide transistors, hydrogenated amorphous silicon thin
film transistors a-Si:H TFTs are still the mainstream indus-
trial technology for active matrix backplanes of displays. In
the past decade, a lot of researches focused on developing
high quality low-temperature processed a-Si:H TFTs fabri-
cated on plastic substrates to achieve nonbreakable flexible
electronics.1–9 Although some experimental transparent poly-
mer foil substrates can sustain high TFT process tempera-
tures of 280–300 °C,10–12 most of the commercially avail-
able low-cost transparent polymer foil substrates can only
tolerate a process temperature of 200 °C or below. These
on-plastic a-Si:H TFTs processed at low temperatures are
less stable and more defective in comparison to conventional
a-Si:H TFTs made at 300 °C or above.1,10–12
Two mechanisms cause the instability of a-Si:H TFTs:
charge trapping in SiNx mainly through tunneling and cre-
ation of metastable dangling bonds in the a-Si:H channel
near the gate dielectric.11,13–17 Although the TFT stability has
been widely studied,1,10–21 the stability of low-temperature
processed on-plastic a-Si:H TFTs operated at elevated tem-
peratures 293–333 K, 20–60 °C has not yet been investi-
gated.
This paper presents the effect of stressing temperature on
the stability of inverted-staggered back-channel-etched
a-Si:H TFTs made on 51 m thick Kapton E polyimide foil
substrates processed at 150 °C. The stability and I-V char-
acteristics of the TFTs were studied at temperatures ranging
from 20 to 60 °C. What was discovered is that the tempera-
ture dependency of the stability is different from that of
a-Si:H TFTs made at a conventional process
temperature.18–21 An abnormal saturation of the threshold
voltage shift Vt at a stressing temperature of 50 °C was
observed. Based on the quantitative analyses of gate leakage
current and off current, we also identified the mechanism
responsible for this abnormal stressing temperature depen-
dent stability.
II. EXPERIMENT
The a-Si:H TFTs were fabricated on 51 m thick Kap-
ton E polyimide foil substrates at 150 °C. These TFTs have
inverted-staggered back-channel-etched structure with chan-
nel dimensions of W=400 m and L=40 m. A schematic
cross section of the TFT on plastic substrate is shown in Fig.
1a. Prior to the device fabrication, the polyimide substrate
was passivated with silicon nitride SiNx layers on both
sides to render better TFT performances.22 First, 100 nm Cr/
Al/Cr gate metal was deposited and patterned, followed by
the deposition of 350 nm SiNx gate dielectric, a 200 nm
undoped a-Si:H channel layer, a 50 nm n+ a-Si:H source-
drain layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition,
and about 100 nm Cr metal by thermal evaporation. Then the
source-drain electrodes and TFT islands were defined by
photolithography and dry/wet etched. Last, the gate contact
hole was opened by dry etching through the gate dielectric.
The TFT performances were evaluated by a HP 4155B
semiconductor parameter analyzer. Transfer characteristics
were studied at source-drain voltages Vds of 1 and 10 V, and
gate voltages Vgs from −10 to 25 V with medium integration
time setting under a dark environment. Electrical gate-bias
stress experiments were carried out by applying 20 V to the
gate while keeping the source and the drain grounded at vari-

very severe Vt at high temperatures because of the faster
defect creation rate inside the a-Si:H layers.18–21 Vt of a-Si
TFT can be formulated as a function of temperature T, stress-
ing time t, and stressing gate-bias voltage Vgs,16
Vt =  AVgst exp− Ea/kT , 1
where the sign on the right hand side corresponds to that of
the polarity of gate bias, Ea is the activation energy, k is the
Boltzmann constant, A is a constant, and  and  are expo-
nents.  depends mostly on the gate bias voltage polarity and
 depends on the device parameters and bias polarity.
With the increase in temperature in TFT gate-bias stress
experiments, the exponent  gets larger and becomes almost
constant beyond 50 °C 323 K. Figure 4a clearly shows a
saturation of Vt beyond 50 °C 323 K. The Arrhenius plot
of Vt after 1850 s of gate-bias stressing is shown in Fig.
4b. The activation energy dramatically drops and becomes
constant for temperatures greater than 50 °C 323 K. This
saturation phenomenon beyond a certain temperature is dif-
ferent from the results reported in the literatures,18–21 where
TFTs being studied were fabricated at temperatures of
300 °C or above. In these previous studies, no such satura-
tion phenomenon was observed at the same temperature
range Fig. 1 in Ref. 18, Fig. 3 in Ref. 19, Fig. 3 in Ref. 20,
and Fig. 11 in Ref. 21 under the gate-bias stress condition.
Based on the above observations, this study concludes
that a large amount of charges, trapped inside the dielectric
SiNx during TFT fabrication and gate-bias stressing, was
thermionically emitted into the channel by the Poole–Frenkel
mechanism at a temperature of 50 °C 323 K. Since the
charges trapped inside the gate dielectric cause Vt,11,13–17
the thermionic emission of the trapped charges leads to the
saturation of Vt and exponent . This phenomenon was
observed in our low-temperature processed TFTs because the
gate dielectric is less stable1,10–12 and the trapped charges are
much easier to release at relatively low temperatures. The
defect level can be estimated by the product of the Boltz-
mann constant and the saturation temperature kT, which is
around 31 meV below the conduction band edge of SiNx.
This also implies that low-temperature processed on-plastic
a-Si:H TFTs can be prestressed to improve the operation
stability at elevated temperatures 20–60 °C.

Thin-film transistors of hydrogenated amorphous silicon a-Si:H
TFTs are the mainstream technology for active matrix backplanes
for flat panel displays. Recent research has focused on fabricating
a-Si:H TFTs on plastic substrate to achieve nonbreakable, comform-
able, and elastic flexible electronics.1-12 Usually, the plastic substrate
is passivated with a barrier layer, often of SiNx, which prevents
solvent penetration during processing, and increases dimensional
stability. Differences between the performance of TFTs made di-
rectly on bare plastic or on passivated plastic have not yet been
studied. We investigated the performance of TFTs made on either
bare Kapton polyimide foil or SiNx passivated Kapton. This evalu-
ation of the effects of substrate passivation goes together with an
evaluation of the effect of the bottom gate metal on TFT perfor-
mance. We coupled this evaluation with a study of the influence of
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition PE-CVD of the gate
nitride on the roughness of the underlying gate metal.

process itself. This finding agrees with reports from other
groups.18,19 Although we believe that the aluminum does not form
hillocks because it is very thin and the PE-CVD temperature of
150°C is low,20 we need to conduct further experiments on alumi-
num deposited with several different techniques to confirm this as-
sumption.
Conclusion
The main contributors to low gate leakage are a SiNx passivation
layer deposited directly on the polyimide substrate and a gate metal
with low surface roughness. The roughness of the gate metal is a
result of metal film growth itself, not of the subsequent plasma
deposition of the gate SiN . The gate metal appears to grow with a
H28 Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 11 2 H26-H28 2008conforms well to the substrate profile. The roughness of Fig. 4 is
lower than that of the gate metal in Fig. 3, because the gate metals of
completed TFTs have been exposed to several additional process
steps. We then performed a 2 min long SiNx deposition using the
same SiNx PE-CVD condition as described in the TFT Fabrication
section. The SiNx thickness is estimated to be 14 nm. We expect this
thin SiNx to conform well to the metal topography, and its roughness
to reflect any effect of the SiNx deposition. On both glass and Kap-
ton, the deposition of the thin SiNx layer is found to reduce the
roughness. The SiNx appears to planarize the metal. We conclude
that the SiNx deposition plasma does not roughen the metal surface.
Instead, the gate metal roughness is determined by metal deposition

deposition for low roughness is important to obtain a gate dielectric
with low leakage current.

the heating stage with temperature controlled by varying the input current. A thermal couple is 
used to measure the temperature during TFT characterization.  
The room temperature characteristics of as-fabricated TFTs with 50nm, 100nm and 
200nm conduction layer thicknesses are shown in Fig. 2. Off-current is about two orders of 
magnitude larger in TFT with 50 nm thick channel layer than in TFTs with thicker channel layers. 
This may be due to discrete tiny amount of n+-Si left on the surface. Nevertheless, further 
plasma etching was not performed since it damages the conduction channel layer. The other 
possibility could be back channel conduction influenced by the environment. Quantitative 
comparison of threshold voltage, on-current, off-current, and mobility is shown in Fig. 3. We 
extracted threshold voltage Vt at Ids = 10
-8 A, on-current Ion at Vgs = 25 V, and off-current at Vgs 
= -5 V from transfer curves of Vds = 10 V. Field-effect mobility µ was calculated from the least-
squares slope fitted to Ids > 10
-8 A with Vds = 0.1 V.

Figure 2 Transfer curves of as-fabricated a-Si:H TFTs (W/L = 400µm/40µm). 
 
From Fig. 3, TFT with 50 nm a-Si:H channel layer has higher threshold voltage, lower 
field-effect mobility, and higher off-current (lower on-off ratio). Its performance is the worst 
among the three. On the other hand, the TFTs with 100 nm conduction channel layer thickness 
perform best. The further increase of conduction channel layer thickness to 200 nm causes the 
reduction of field-effect mobility and increase of threshold voltage. The reasons are not clear yet.

Effects of operation temperature variation 
 
Figure 6 shows the operational temperature dependent stability. Rising the temperature 
from 24 oC to 56 oC, the threshold voltage drops about 2 V. Meanwhile, the on-current increases 
~ 30 µA from 10 µA while off-current increases about one order of magnitude, which is mainly 
caused by the thermal excitation of carriers added in the off-regime. This leads to the decrease of 
on-off ratio at higher temperature [10]. The rise of off-current for more negative Vgs indicates 
conduction of hole-current [11], with holes supplied from thermal excitation.
