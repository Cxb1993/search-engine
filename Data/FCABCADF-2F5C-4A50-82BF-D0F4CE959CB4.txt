Abstract 
 
 Laminated rubber bearings used in base isolation require the reinforcing elements to 
constrain the deformation of the rubber to increase the compression stiffness and flexure 
stiffness, so that the bearings can firmly support the superstructure. The reinforcing elements 
of isolation bearings, which are normally steel plates, can be replaced by the fiber 
reinforcement. The fiber-reinforced isolator is significantly lighter and can be made by a 
much less labor-intensive manufacturing process. In contrast to the steel reinforcement, 
which is assumed to be rigid, the fiber reinforcement is flexible in extension, such that the 
stiffness formula of the steel-reinforced bearing is not suitable for the fiber-reinforced bearing. 
The purpose of this research project is to derive the flexure stiffness formula of the circular 
elastic layer bonded between the extensible reinforcements, which then can be utilized in the 
design of the fiber-reinforced bearings. In theoretical derivation, the deformation of the 
elastic layer is assumed that the horizontal plane remains plane and the vertical line becomes 
parabolic. Since the compressibility is considered in the elastic layer, the result can be applied 
to the bearings with large shape factor. In this project, finite element analysis on the 
fiber-reinforced bearings is carried out to study the accuracy of the theoretical solution. 
 
Keywords: Elastomeric bearing, Fiber reinforcement, Flexure stiffness, Seismic isolation. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
A laminated elastomeric bearing consists of elastomeric layers bonded to interleaving 
reinforcing sheets. High stiffness of reinforcements restrains the lateral expansion of 
elastomeric layers and results in higher stiffness than an unbonded elastomeric layer in the 
vertical direction normal to the layer. By this characteristic, a laminated elastomeric bearing 
can provide high vertical rigidity to sustain gravity loading, while still providing the same

The displacement functions  and  represent the bulge deformation in the elastic 
layers, which are plotted in Fig. 2 as functions of  for 
0u 0v
br / 20=S , 49995.0=ν , 3.0=ν f  
and several stiffness ratios . The figure shows that the elastic layer bonded with the 
reinforcements of higher stiffness has larger bulge deformation. The reinforcement 
displacements  and  are plotted in Fig. 3 as functions of  for 
γ
1u 1v br / 20=S , 
,  and several stiffness ratios , which indicate that the reinforcement 
has less deformation for the reinforcements of higher stiffness. The radial displacement

1u
01.0=γ  is very close to that of 001.0=γ  in the center part, but has an obvious 
difference near the edge. 
 
4. Tilting stiffness 
 
According to beam theory, the effective tilting stiffness of the elastic layer is defined as 
∫ ∫= π θθσρ 20 20 cos)( drdrEI b zzeff  (62) 
in which zzσ  is the effective vertical stress defined as 
∫−= 2/ 2/1 tt zzzz dzt σσ  (63) 
By using the displacement solution in the last section, the effective vertical stress can be 
derived as 
 10
bending modulus increases with increasing the Poisson’s ratio of the elastic layer or the 
stiffness of the reinforcement. For the high shape factor )20( =S , the bending modulus 
dramatically increases when ν  is close to 0.5 and  is close to 0. The solutions of the 
finite element method are also plotted in Fig. 4. The finite element model is a bearing of 20 
elastic layers. Both ends of the bearing are free for the lateral deformation. The theoretical 
solution derived in this paper assumes every sheet of reinforcement in the bearing has the 
same deformation, which means that the boundary effect at the ends of the bearing is 
neglected and the ideal model of the theoretical solution is a bearing having an infinite 
number of elastic layers. Therefore, the finite element solutions have slight deviation from 
the theoretical solutions. In Fig. 5(b), the bending modules calculated from Eq. (66) for the 
incompressible elastic layers are compared with the solutions by Tsai and Kelly (2002b), 
which indicates that the solution by Tsai and Kelly (2002b) is applicable only when the shape 
factor is high and the stiffness ratio is low.

5. Stress distribution 
 
The shear stresses in the bonding surface between the elastic layer and the reinforcement, 
 and , can be derived by substituting Eqs. (57) and (58) into Eqs. 
(17) and (18), respectively. The bonding shear stress in the radial direction at 
)2/,,( trrz θτ )2/,,( trz θτθ
0=θ  and the 
bonding shear stress in the tangential direction at 2/πθ =  are plotted in Fig. 6 as functions 
of  for , br / 20=S 49995.0=ν , 3.0=ν f  and several stiffness ratios , which indicates 
that, for the elastic layer bonded with the reinforcements of lower stiffness, the bonding shear 
stress in the radial direction increases more sharply near the boundary, and the bonding shear 
stress in the tangential direction distributes more uniformly over the central part.

Substituting the reinforcement displacements in Eqs. (60) and (61) into Eqs. (12) to (14), 
the in-plane force components in the reinforcement are
