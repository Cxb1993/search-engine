摘    要 
本研究是探討經過電鍍後的鎳奈米線，經由不同退火處理後所生成的奈米氧化鎳之研究。
奈米鎳線首先由電化學方法沈積于陽極氧化鋁模板內，之後在經由真空、空氣與氧氣下退
火處理 200°C 至 900°C。在真空下退火，會使得奈米金屬鎳線沿著(111)的方向成長，但在
氧氣下退火 500°C後結果顯示會生成三氧化二鎳（Ni2O3）奈米線，但在空氣與氧氣更高溫
下退火，則會維持三氧化二鎳的晶體結構。而此種相變化的過程可以藉由尺寸效應（size 
effect）加以解釋之。

Abstract 
The effect of Ni nanowires, fabricated by electrodeposition into self-ordered AAO templates, was 
studied. NiO and Ni2O3 nanofibers have been fabricated by simple heat-treated in air and in an 
atmosphere of pure O2. The Ni nanowires in vacuum annealing pronounced the preferential 
orientation of Ni (111) at 600°C. Grain growth resulted in size effects and induced the 
transformation NiO to Ni2O3 during annealing in air. Ni oxidized Ni2O3 (~500°C) in an 
atmosphere of pure O2 is existed. The more stable Ni-oxides are Ni2O3 during annealing higher 
temperature (~ 900°C) in air and in an atmosphere of pure O2.

1. Introduction 
Magnetic nanowire arrays have recently 
attracted much attention as mesoscopic model 
systems and as potential materials for 
advanced data storage and magneto-electronic 
applications [1]. Various multilayered 
nanowires including Co/Cu [2] and NiFe/Cu 
[3] have been studied intensively. However, as 
far as we know, only a few studies on 
Ni-oxide nanofibers, especially Ni2O3 in the 
literature. Recently, some researches have 
utilized chemical vapor deposition (CVD), 
electrodeposition, and sol-gel method with 
template membranes to prepare well-defined 
metal [4-5] and metal-oxide nanowires [6-7]. 
Among the various methods used for 
fabrication of nanoarrays, template synthesis 
[8-10] using electrodeposition has proved to 
be a low cost and high yield technique for 
producing large arrays of nanowires. Our 
researches contributed greatly to the 
fabrication of NiO and Ni2O3 nanocrystals 
through Ni nanowires annealing in air and in 
an atmosphere of pure O2. This interest has 
occurred so as to fabricate nickel-oxide 
nanowires only for adequately controlling 
 4
of Ni and O. Furthermore, the preferential 
orientation of Ni (111) is obviously shown. 
The texture coefficient (TC) can be derived 
from the each peak area in the XRD spectra 
and defined: 
TC=I(111)/(I(111)+I(200)+I(220))       (1) 
where I(111), I(200) and I(220) are the integrated 
intensity of (111), (200) and (220) planes. 
Figure 3 illustrates the TC as a function 
of various vacuum annealing. The TC is 
always above 0.5 and the maximum is around 
0.8 at 600°C, which is 0.61, calculated in Ref. 
13. It is revealed that the preferential 
orientation of Ni (111) was improved by 
recrystallization. 
Figure 4 illustrates the diffraction pattern 
of Ni nanowires being annealed in air at 
varied temperature. The Ni2O3 phase is 
matched with JCPDS cards [15]. At 
temperature increased over 300°C, the NiO 
(111) was exhibited. With further annealing at 
500°C, both of the NiO (220) and NiO (200) 
are observed. It is interesting that the 
occurrence of Ni2O3 (004) at 700°C. 
Furthermore, as temperature increased around 
900°C, the preferred orientation of Ni2O3 (004) 
plane is obviously revealed and both of Ni and 
NiO can still be observed. In comparison with 
Figure 4, when the annealing treatment was 
used in an atmosphere of pure O2 at various 
temperature was shown in Figure 5. It 
indicates that the Ni nanowire is not oxidized 
up to 500°C. With annealing at 500°C, the 
Ni2O3 (002) is existed. The dominant of Ni2O3 
(004) plane, furthermore, is obviously 
revealed and NiO also existed at 900°C. The 
results of Fig. 4 and 5 are listed in Table 1 and 
2, respectively. It has never been reported by 
past literatures for Ni oxidized Ni2O3 at lower 
temperature (~500°C). 
The size effects have shown that the 
reduction of nanoparticle size results in the 
increase in the ionicity and the stabilization of 
a more symmetric structure [16, 17]. It is well 
known that the structure NiO is more ionic 
than Ni2O3 from the viewpoint of Fajan’s rules 
of ionic polarization [18]. Moreover, NiO 
(cubic) is more symmetric than Ni2O3 
(hexagonal) [19]. It is obviously realized that 
annealing promotes the grain growth. And 
than grain growth resulted in size effects and 
induced the transformation NiO to Ni2O3 
during annealing in air are reasonable. We 
could draw a conclusion that the more stable 
Ni-oxides are Ni2O3 during annealing higher 
temperature (~ 900°C) in air.  
Nevertheless, in an atmosphere of pure 
O2, the Ni2O3 (002) existed firstly at annealing 
500°C, co-existed NiO and Ni2O3 at higher 
temperature and dominated the Ni2O3 (004) 
plane at 900°C. When in an atmosphere of 
pure O2, the concentration as well as 
temperature resulted in annealing promotes 
the grain growth affect the oxidation. The 
differences between annealed in air and in an 
atmosphere of O2 at 500°C might be the 
reasons of size effect and the concentration of 
O2. O2 concentration and thermal annealing 
resulted in the existence of more stable Ni 
oxide (Ni2O3) at 500°C. Further varied the 
annealing O2 atmosphere is needed to 
elucidate the phenomena.  
 
4. Conclusion 
We have fabricated Ni nanowires by 
electrodeposition into self-order nanoporous 
AAO templates. TEM/SAD results showed 
that these nanowires have a uniform length 
and diameter, and are pure in quality. The Ni 
nanowires in vacuum annealing pronounced 
the preferential orientation of Ni (111) at 
600°C. Grain growth resulted in size effects
