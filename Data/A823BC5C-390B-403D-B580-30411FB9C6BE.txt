the high strength cross-ply CF/PEEK prepregs. 
The PEEK polymer can sustain its mechanical 
properties up to 423K [5-6], thus it is 
postulated that the current Ti/CF/PEEK 
composite laminates might be utilized at higher 
temperatures. 
Anodic oxidation is a commonly used surface 
treatment, especially on titanium alloys for 
structural and engineering applications. 
However, the bonding of polymer composites 
to titanium is still a problem, which has not 
been fully resolved.  In order to improve their 
adhesive properties, many surface treatments 
have been studied and discussed [7-8]. 
Previous research has shown that bond 
durability and strength can be improved by 
surface treating [9]. Ramani [10] found the 
chromic acid anodic method has excellent bond 
durability and strengths. Chromic acid 
electroplating produces an oxide layer which 
thickness is 40~80 nm for the 5 and 10V 
treatments [11]. The electroplating is a chromic 
acid solution with and without hydrofluoric 
acid (HF) addition. Zwilling, et al. [12] 
revealed a thin oxide compact layer is formed 
in chromic acid electroplating and a duplex 
film composed of a compact layer surmounted 
by a porous layer grows from the fluorinated 
electroplating. 
With successful bonding of Ti and APC-2 and 
the modified diaphragm curing process, 
Ti/APC-2 hybrid composite laminates were 
fabricated. Their, the mechanical properties 
subjected to tensile and the cyclic tests at 
elevated temperatures were obtained. The 
failure mechanisms were observed. The 
response of mechanical behavior was 
highlighted. 
Test Panel Fabrication 
The twelve-inch wide unidirectional 
AS-4/PEEK prepregs from ICI Fiberite Co., 
(USA) were cut and stacked into cross-ply 
[0/90]s laminates. The grade 1 (H: 0.015%, O: 
0.18%, N: 0.03%, Fe: 0.2%, C: 0.08% ) Ti 
sheets, supplied by KOBE STEEL LTD (Japan), 
were 0.5mm thick after rolled, heated and 
flattened with scratch brushing. The density of 
grade l Ti is 4.51 g/cm3, melting point 
temperature is 1670°C, ultimate tensile 
strength is 340MPa, and modulus of elasticity 
is 103 GPa. 
Prior to lamination, the slimmed Ti sheets were 
subjected to pretreatment in order to create the 
tough bonding with the APC-2 prepregs. 
Naturally, Ti sheets possess high resistance to 
chemical etching. Thus, two different surface 
treatments of titanium had been chosen. 
However, after a series of fatigue tests, the 
surface treatment by mechanical polishing 
method was found poor durability of bonding 
interface and delamination has been found after 
104 cycles. The surface treatment by chromic 
acid anodic method of electro-plating was 
found much better as demonstrated by the 
results of mechanical tensile and cyclic tests. 
After anodic processing, the thickness of oxide 
coating film is about 40~80nm. The anodic 
oxide coating was observed uniformly by SEM 
and composition found by EDS consisting of 
TiO2. 
The APC-2 prepregs were sandwiched with the 
Titanium sheet to produce Ti/CF/PEEK hybrid 
laminated composites, expressed as Ti/APC-2/ 
Ti/APC-2/Ti totally 5 layers. The modified 
diaphragm curing process was adopted as 
shown in Figure 1. The geometry and 
dimensions of a hybrid composite specimen 
were shown in Figure 2.
