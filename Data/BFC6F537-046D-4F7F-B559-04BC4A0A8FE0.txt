Abstract 
Low temp (60
o
C~80
o
C) PEMFCs are applicable to 
portable, small electronics, stationary power source, 
and automobiles. In operation, these fuel cells are 
long time in cycles of “open” and “close” status. 
Thus the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and 
proton exchange membrnes are in cycles of “high 
Temp ←→ low Temp” and “low humidity ←→ 
high humidity”. The main purpose of this proposal is 
to investigate the durability of Nafion mmebranes 
under various temperatures (Temp= 30-90C) and 
humidities (RH= 30-90%). DuPont Nafion-212 
membrane and Nafion membranes prepared by 
solutions casting in our lab were used to carried out 
the environmental durability test using dynamical 
mechanical analysis (DMA). The stress relaxation 
storage modulus master curves were formed from 
DMA data using time-Temperature-superposition 
(TTS) method. 
Keywords: Nafion, solutions, membrane, durability. 
 
1. Introduction 
Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) 
have received considerable attentions due to their low 
pollution and high efficiency of energy conversion. In 
an operating PEMFC, the proton exchange membrane 
(PEM) must readily allow proton transport through it, 
while preventing the reactant gases from mixing. 
Nafion (trade name of Du Pont Co.) is currently one 
of the most promising PEMs for low temperature 
(Temp< 100
o
C) for PEMFCs. When applying to fuel 
cells, Nafion membranes must be sufficiently 
hydrated for efficient proton transport. It may expand 
more than 22% in volume when fully hydrated with 
concomitant dimensional changes [1]. When 
constrained in a fuel cell, substantial hygrothermal 
stresses develop as moisture and temperature vary 
during operation stresses that are believed to 
significantly affect the durability of the PEM.  
The time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP) 
has been successfully applied to a wide range of 
polymers [2]. Using the TTSP, one can predict the 
long time mechanical properties of polymers from 
short time experimental data at various temperatures. 
In the present study, the TTSP method was used to 
form stress relaxation (log G’ vs. log (time)) matser 
curves with Tref= 50
o
C and 70
o
C under the 
environment with various humidities for commercial 
Nafion-212 membrane (DuPont, thickness ~50 m) 
and membranes cast from the Nafion solutions with 
various solvents, which have various solubility 
parameters () and dielectric constants (). The 
purpose of this work is to study the influence of the 
solvents and environmetal humidity on the 
viscoelastic properties of the solution cast Nafion 
membranes.  
 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Nafion solution casting membrane 
preparations---The solvent of as received 5 wt% 
Nafion solution (DuPont Co, EW=1100) was 
evaporated at 60
o
C under vacuum for 1 h to obtain a 
solid resin. The solid Nafion resin was then dissolved 
in DMAc (N,N’-dimethyl acetamide), DMF 
(N,N’-dimethyl formamide), NMF (N-methyl 
formamide), MeOH-H2O (methanol-H2O, 4/1 g/g), 
EtOH-H2O (ethanol-H2O, 4/1 g/g), and IPA-H2O 
(isopropyl alcohol-H2O, 4/1 g/g) solvents to prepare 
5wt% Nafion solutions. The Nafion solutions 
prepared were cast in glass vessels and the solvents 
were evaporated at 50
o
C (which is below TG=100
o
C 
of Nafion) for 30 h, then under vacuum at 80
o
C for 
another 1 h. The membranes were annealed under 
vacuum at 125
o
C for 90 min. The final thickness of 
each membrane was ~50±5 m. The membranes were 
then stored at 90
o
C with in glass vessels under 
relative humidities of 30%RH,50%RH, 70%RH, and 
90%RH before TGA (thermogravimetric analysis), 
DMA (dynamic mechanical analysis), and proton 
conductivity measurements. The membranes were 
stored at least for one week to reach equilibrium

3.3. DSC study 
 The influence of casting solvents on the degree of 
backbone aggregations and ether sulfonic acid group 
aggregations of Nafion membranes after annealing at 
150
o
C for 90 min were investigated using DSC. Figs. 
2-a and 2-b show DSC data of membranes stored at 
90
o
C with 30% RH and 30
o
C with 90%RH, 
respectively. Tables 3-a and 3-b summarize the data 
of peak temperatures and enthalpy of each 
endothermic peak of Figs. 2-a and 2-b, respectively. 
The DSC low temperature endothermic enthalpy 
from 30-120
o
C can be attributed to the evaporation of 
free water. The middle temperature endothermic 
enthalpy around 120-220
o
C can be attributed to the 
evaporation of water associated with sulfonic acid 
groups. The endothermic enthalpy around 200-260
o
C 
can be attributed to the dissociation of Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbone aggregations [Yu Polymer 
47,48]. However it is hard to separate three 
endothermic regions from DSC data, due to the 
overlap of these endothermic regions. In Figs. 2-a 
and 2-b, DSC data showed two endothermic peaks 
and were separated into two peaks. In Tables 3-a and 
3-b, we show the data of endothermic peak 
temperature-1 and enthalpy-1 (T1 and H1), 
endothermic peak temperature-2 and enthalpy-2 (T2 
and H2). Enthalpy-1 is the combination of enthalpy 
contributed from the evaporation of free water and 
the evaporation of water associated with sulfonic acid 
groups. Enthalpy-2 is the combinations of enthalpy 
contributed from the evaporation of water associated 
with sulfonic acid groups and the dissociation of 
backbones aggregations. The results of Tables 3-a 
and 3-b show the membranes prepared from 
alcohol-water solvents have higher H1 and H2 
values than those prepared from DMAc, DMF, and 
NMF, indicating the membranes prepared from 
alcohol-water solvents had higher water uptake and 
higher degree of perfluorocarbon backbone 
aggregations than those prepared from DMAc, DMF, 
and NMF solvents. These data also show H1 and 
H2 data decrease when the solvents for preparing 
membranes varied from MeOH-H2O to EtOH-H2O 
and to IPA-H2O. The DSC results are consistent with 
water uptake data obtained from TGA measurements.

higher G’ than other membranes due to its low 
content of moisture (i.e., low cotent of plasticizer). 
However at 90%RH, the G’ stress relaxation for 
membranes prepared from different solvents are 
separated. The membranes casting from alcohol-H2O 
mixture solutions have lower G’ values than those 
casting from DMAc, DMF, and NMF solvents. 
Especially, the membrane casting from NMF solvent 
has a much higher G’ value. The different mechanical 
properties can be attribute to the different membrane 
moisture contents.

[1] Title: High temperature PEMFC PBI/PTFE composite membrane (oral) 
A polybenzimidazole (PBI)/poly(tetrafluoro ethylene) (PTFE) composite membrane was prepared 
by impregnating a thin porous PTFE film (thickness 15~20 m) in a PBI/N,N’-dimethyl actamide 
(DMAc) solution. The membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were prepared from a PBI/PTFE 
composite (thickness ~30 m) and a pure PBI membranes (thickness ~80 m) doped with 
phosphoric acid (6.02 mol H3PO4/mole PBI repeat unit). The high mechanical strength of PTFE 
allowed the PBI/PTFE to have a lower thickness than pure PBI membrane which led PBI/PTFE 
membrane to have lower proton resistance than pure PBI membrane. The PEMFC unit cell tests 
results at 160
o
C showed the MEA prepared from PBI/PTFE had a better fuel cell performance than 
that prepared from pure PBI membrane. A 500 h life test of PBI/PTFE MEA was carried out at 
160
o
C with a current density i=200 mA/cm
2
. The experiment data showed a 120 h period of 
activation. After 120 h the cell voltage started to decay with a decay rate of 8.33x10
-5
 V/h. 
 
[2] Title: Catalyst layer structures of PEMFC membrane electrode assemblies 
The conventional 5-layer membrane electrode assembly (MEA) consists of a proton exchange 
membrane (PEM) locating at its center, two layers of Pt-C-40 (Pt on carbon support with 40 wt% Pt 
content) catalyst locating next on both surfaces of PEM, and two gas diffusion layers (GDL) 
locating next on the outer surfaces of Pt-C layers (structure-a MEA). In this paper, we report a 
modified 7-layer MEA. In addition to the two Pt-C-40 catalyst layers locating next on both surfaces 
of PEM, two thin Pt-C-80 (Pt content 80 wt%) catalyst layers are fabricated locating between 
Pt-C-40 catalyst layer and GDL. We find the modified MEA with 20 ~ 40 wt% Pt contributed from 
Pt-C-80 has better fuel cell performance than the conventional 5-layer MEA consisting only of 
Pt-C-40. The reasons for the better fuel cell performance of these modified MEAs are attributed to 
the better feasibility for O2 gas to reach cathode Pt particles and lower proton transport resistance in 
catalyst layers of the modified MEA than the conventional 5-layer MEA.
