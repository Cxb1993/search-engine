analyze the performance degradation and variations
in stability and controllability of transports
encountering hazardous weather, a numerical
simulation system must be capable of exhibiting,
with high fidelity, the highly nonlinear nature of
forces and moments acting on transports. The
framework diagram of this flight simulator is shown
in Fig. 1.1. To learn the unknown factors for all
kinds of the transports response in different
hazardous weather, this simulation system can be
used effectively through the concept of variation of
parameters [3]. An example of the atmospheric
turbulence study as the effects of weather hazards
on aircraft will be examined in this paper.
Fig. 1.1 The framework diagram for Multi-Purpose
Desktop Flight Simulator and Flying
Qualities Evaluation System
As aircraft fly in turbulence condition, the
large instantaneous variation of g-load and dynamic
aerodynamic effects frequently have a large impact
on flight safety. In the year of 1990, the average
annual economic loss of aircraft accident due to
turbulence in the United State is about 100 millions.
Turbulence fatalities are relatively few, but injuries
are numerous.
In reference [4], the atmospheric turbulence
severity was estimated in real time from in-situ
aircraft measurements. The eddy dissipation rate
was calculated through NCAR’s algorithmfrom the
measurement of aircraft normal acceleration based
on the assumption of a homogeneous, continuous,
linear von Kármán turbulence model coupled with a
linear transfer function of the aircraft dynamics.
NCAR’s model is intended for continuous 
turbulence environments and cannot handle the
single-event type of gust. Another approach of a
normal-force in-situ turbulence algorithm for
aircraft [5] was toward skipping the measure of
turbulence itself (i.e., eddy dissipation rate) and
directly reporting (or deriving) the aircraft response
(hazard) instead, still based on linear aerodynamics.
In the study of reference [6], turbulence
hazards to aircraft were mainly through the vertical
wind field, not eddy dissipation rates, radar
reflectivity, or other parameters. The required scale
of predicted turbulence motion was 50 m with a
wave number of about 0.126 rad/m). The
requirement was based on the assumption of von
Kármán’s power spectral density. In most
applications this requirement was not matched. Real
turbulence is not isotropic (so that w- and
v-distributions are not the same) and does not
totaly possess von Kármán’s power spectral density. 
In other words, it is non-Gaussian.
Among the different turbulence phenomena,
the clear-air turbulence is all the more important in
flight safety since it is hard to detect and predict.
The dynamic aerodynamic characteristics during
the clear-air turbulence encounter can only be
analyzed well by using the unsteady aerodynamic
model [7]. A comparative analysis for two twin-jet
transports that had encountered clear-air turbulence
will be presented in this paper through the
simulation system to demonstrate the capability in
effective analyses of the performance degradation
and variations in stability and controllability of
aircraft encountering hazardous weather.
The concept of “efective mass”and “efective 
damping” of the plunging motion [8] is also
employed in the present study to establish the
quantitative analysis index. The quantitative
analysis index can be used to evaluate the effects of
clear-air turbulence hazards on aircraft stability and
controllability.
Because of the desire of using this system as a
tool for accident investigation, it is necessary to
focus on handling and flying qualities in steady and
unsteady aerodynamic environments. The various
flight mode characteristics, such as short-period
mode, Dutch-roll mode, etc. at each time step can
be evaluated during time integration to monitor
flight dynamic stability from flight simulation. One
of these two transports in the present paper is
identified as having deficiency in the short period
characteristics during the plunging motion in the
clear-air turbulence encounter through the
eigenvalue extraction of the flight dynamic
equations.

The longitudinal equivalent reduced frequency
can be obtained through the following
dimensionless equation after 1 has been
calculated:

 (8)
where 1is the circular frequency, representing the
quickness of change in the angle of attack; c is
the mean chord length of wings.

2.4 Plunging Motion
We will focus on the one-dimensional vertical
motion (i.e.the plunging motion), as it affects the
passengers’ safety the most. The normal force
coefficient is obtained from the normal acceleration
as follows:

The flight dynamics simulation model can be

equations based on the body axes. However, it is

III. AERODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT
A comparative analysis for two twin-jet
transports that had encountered clear-air turbulence
will be presented for the present study through the
simulation system. Table 3.1 is the flight conditions
and the response to turbulence encountered for the
two different twin-jet transports. Transports of A
and B have almost the same flight conditions and
the time interval in clear-air turbulence, except the
ways of the pilots’responses in operations.

aop : The pilot applied the longitudinal control

bop : The pilot was instructed not to apply the
longitudinal control during the encounter
Fig. 3.1 presents the time history of na , flight
altitude, angle of attack, and pitch rate in turbulence
for Transport A. In Fig. 3.1(a), the normal
acceleration ( na ) is highest around t = 3930 sec.,
and is lowest around t = 3932 sec. Fig. 3.1(c) shows
thatis approximately in phase with na . The initial
increase in load and (right before A) was
probably due to the vertical wind. When na is
highest positively (A point), the altitude is the
lowest. At A, the g-load is the largest positive, with
the aircraft rapidly plunging downward, with 
reaching about 6.5 deg., which is well above the
cruise value. Mach number is about 0.77 at that
point. In transonic flight, compressibility effect
could be important.
On the other hand, the instantaneousof
Transport B reaches a value greater than 5 deg. (Fig.
3.2). The main important difference is that during
the encounter the g-load is quite oscillatory, and the
altitude does not drop as compared with that in
Figure 3.1. Note that the pilot of Transport B was
instructed not to apply the longitudinal control
during the encounter.
Fig. 3.1 The time history of na , flight altitude, angle
of attack, and pitch rate in turbulence
encountered for Transport A
Since sudden drop in altitude may cause more
injury to passengers and flight crews, it is of interest
to examine the causes of the drop. Figure 3.3
presents the time history of control inputs and the
pitch angles with the associated normal
accelerations, angles of attack and stabilizer angles.
It appears that the pitch rates may have been
generated by pilot’s action. At around t = 3930, the 
altitude was dropping fast, so the pilot was trying to
pull up the aircraft. On the other hand, around t =
3932, the aircraft was rising, and the pilot was
trying to push the nose down.

of attack, and pitch rate in turbulence

3. Low effective mass gives always low na .
4. Moderate effective mass, but low damping, gives
lower positive an.
Fig. 4.1 Effective damping and mass for the
plunging motion of Transport A in
turbulence encounter
Fig. 4.2 Effective damping and mass for the
plunging motion of Transport B in
turbulence encounter
Since damping for the vertical motion is
mainly provided by CN that is reduced by wing
stall, a strategy in control is to prevent wing stall.
Damping for the Transport B is much higher (not
shown). The main difference between the Transport
A and Transport B are that the effective mass and
damping for the latter are larger on the average, in
particular the damping. When there is a high
damping, there will be less transient period and the
aircraft will be very responsive to gust input.
One reason for the Transport B not suffering
from the wing stall effects, even though reached
higher than 5 degrees as shown in Fig. 3.2(c), is
probably because of unsteady aerodynamics. The
effect of unsteady aerodynamics, in particular in
dynamic stall, is dependent on the magnitude of
longitudinal reduced frequency (and hence the
vertical wind field). The higher the values of
reduced frequency, the less reduction in wing lift
would occur in stall. In fact, the wing lift may be
even increased in a dynamic stall.
The longitudinal reduced frequency is defined
in Eq. (8) of section 2.3 in this paper. The reduced
frequencies for both the Transport A and Transport
B are presented in Fig. 4.3. It is seen that the
aerodynamic environment for the Transport B is
much more unsteady (with t =190–200 sec. for the
Transport B, and t=3920 – 3940 sec. for the
Transport A).

and Transport B during turbulence

V. FLIGHT SIMULATION ANALYSIS
The speed components (u,v,w) based on the
body axes must be due to motion only in flight
dynamics simulation (see Eqs. 32 –34). At present,
the available information includes wind speeds and
directions, drift angles and vertical climb speed, all
sampled at low frequencies. At any rate, these

1. The performance degradation and variations in
stability and controllability for the two twin-jet
transports that had encountered clear-air
turbulence could be examined and simulated to
associate with normal acceleration readings.
2. The quantitative analyses of “efective massand
damping” could be used as indicators for the
effects of turbulence hazards on aircraft stability
in plunging motions.
3. The pilot should be instructed not to apply the
longitudinal control or the control should be
applied more gradually with a smaller increment.
Otherwise, instability of the short period mode
could be excited in plunging motion.
4. Due to the limited recording frequency in the
QAR, the instantaneous g-load and aerodynamic
effects could not be recorded in the QAR during
clear-air turbulence encounter of an aircraft with
a sufficient accuracy to determine the random
characteristics. In addition, the accurate
turbulence fields (vertical, horizontal and cross
winds) are needed to verify the QAR records
and fill a gap in the onboard-recorded data.
