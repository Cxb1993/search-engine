Abstract 
The CO2 fixation reaction was carried out by using propylene oxide (PO) as 
reactant and medium; the cyclohexylamine carbonylation by CO2 was using ionic 
liquid as solvent and catalyst; the kinetics of these two widely adopted reaction 
systems for CO2 utilization was studied. For semibatch reaction mode, as reaction 
temperature, pressure and catalyst ratio and amount were varied, it was found that the 
reaction was under kinetic control, for pressure ranging from 15 to 50 atm, rather than 
mass transfer control. From the kinetic data, they show a pseudo first order kinetics 
with respect to PO or cyclohexylamine concentrations under constant CO2 pressure. 
Their corresponding activation energy was calculated to be 9.152 kcal/mol and 5.837 
kcal/mol. The reaction kinetics was independent of catalyst ratio and amount, yet the 
optimal catalyst ratio of [Bmim]Br/ZnCl2 is 2 for the fixation reaction. They are also 
high conversion reactions, 96.0% (PO) and 80.9% (cyclohexylamine), with easier 
product separation. As for continuous reaction in a fixed bed reactor with 
immobilized ionic liquid catalyst in conjunction with zinc chloride, 
[Bpim]Br(ZnCl2)/SiO2, the reaction parameters were pressure(10~25atm), PO/CO2 
molar ratio(0.095~0.15), contact time(43~12sec), and temperature(90~130oC). The 
experimental data showed that the reaction was kinetic control rather than mass 
transfer. The conversion of propylene oxide increased with temperature increase, 
while other conditions remained the same. The conversion of propylene oxide 
decreased with contact time decrease. Assumed it was the first order kinetics with 
respect to the concentration of propylene oxide. According the plug flow reactor (PFR) 
model, the reaction rate constant can be estimated as: 5.43 s-1,5.8 s-1,6.06 s-1 at 
90oC,110oC,130oC respectively, and activation energy is 3390 J/mol. When applied to 
industry for CO2 reduction, these kinetic information would be very useful for future 
industrial scale reactor design.

The catalytic reactions are often operated in a semibatch mode, in which reactions between 
gaseous and liquid reactants take place. The reaction path is that CO2 molecules diffuse to the liquid 
phase, and then through a stagnant liquid film at the catalyst surface for reaction. Thus the reaction rate 
may be controlled by either mass transfer, kinetics or both. Park et al. [19] studied the reaction kinetics 
of CO2 reaction with epoxides, using quaternary salts as catalysts, in a semi-batch reactor. A slow 
stream of CO2 is continuously passed to the solution of glycidyl mehylacrylate (GMA) (toluene as 
solvent). The reaction showed a pseudo first order reaction with respect to the concentration of GMA, 
and the rate constant increased with temperature and the activation energy was estimated as 8.48 
kcal/mol. Park et al. [20] further investigated the solvent effects on the kinetic of CO2 reaction with 
phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) using toluene, N-methyl-2- pyrrolidinone or dimethyl sulfoxide as 
solvents, and found that the reaction rate was larger than CO2 transfer rate. These solvents greatly 
affect the rate constants. However, instead of using other organic solvents, recent studies for these CO2 
fixation reactions, have shifted to adopt epoxides as reactants and reaction media, and the results have 
been quite successful [2, 15-17]. Nonetheless, for CO2 carbonylation reactions, using amine as solvent 
would be very difficult, due to product precipitation during reaction. Ionic liquids are not only good 
solvents, but also good CO2 absorption fluids, making them very useful in CO2 utilization reactions. 
Shi et al. [18] used ionic liquid as solvent and catalyst for amine carbonylation, and the results were 
also very successful. Both reaction systems are potentially applicable to industrial scale production 
processes, but their kinetic studies have not been undertaken. In this work, we propose a kinetic study 
for these two applicable reaction systems: (i) large amount of propylene oxide as both reactant and 
solvent under constant CO2 pressure; and (ii) ionic liquid as reaction media and catalyst for CO2- 
cyclohexylamine reaction in a semibatch reactor. The kinetics describes the influence of reaction 
variables (pressure, temperature, concentration) on the reaction rate and the extent that these reactions 
can proceed. The information is very important for reactor design in their future industrial applied 
processes. 
Recently, the immobilization of ionic liquid has been successfully applied for the CO2- oxirane 
reaction. It is the industrial preferred reaction system, because of the ease of separation and the 
possibility to use a fixed-bed reactor. With gaseous reactants flow through catalyst immobilization bed, 
no solvent involved, reactions may develop through new mechanistic pathways, compared with above 
classical reactors. This work will investigate the reaction models, without solvents, for gas –liquid 
reaction in a semi-batch mode, and gaseous reactants flowing through fixed bed reactor.

conditions were varied for this work. 
The samples of the final resulting products were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed to 
determine their purity in a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Trace GC/ Trace MS, 
Thermo Finnigan, Austin, TX, US) with library: Nist Mass Spectral Search Program version 1.6d. The 
mass spectrometer was equipped with an electron impact ion source and a quadropole analyzer. The 
system was controlled by X’calibur software. A Rtx-5MS sil capillary fused silica column (30m 
×0.25mm i.d. ×0.25μm film thickness, Restek, Bellefonte, PA, US) was used in the GC separation.  
 
Results and discussion 
In fact, both reaction systems have been reported previously [2, 15-18, 23]in a semibatch reactor: 
the solventless coupling reaction of CO2 to propylene oxide, which required no additional organic 
solvents either for the reaction or for the separation of product, under catalysis of [Bmim]Br/ZnCl2; the 
cyclohexylamine carbonylation by CO2 using ionic liquid as solvent and catalyst, [Bmim]Br/KOH. 
They are heterogenic reactions, and the reaction rates could be controlled by reaction kinetics, mass 
transfer or both. It was expected that, through varying reaction parameters such as temperature, 
pressure, time and molar ratio of catalysts and their concentrations, the reaction kinetics can be 
delineated. To ensure the validity of experimental data, each experiment in this work was repeated 3 
times, and the results were averaged for further analysis. Similar results were also obtained: the 
reaction mixture purity, conducted by GC/MS method, shows that the selectivity for fixation reaction 
to produce propylene carbonate (PC) remains above 99% in all cases, irrespective of the conditions 
used in this work; the purity of the final solid product, 1,3-dicyclohexylurea, for carbonylation reaction 
is also >99%, regardless of reaction conditions used.  
 
Influence of catalyst amount and ratio 
In order to reveal the influence of catalyst ratio, [Bmim][Br]/ZnCl2 and [Bmim]Br/KOH, and 
total catalyst amount, ([Bmim][Br]+ZnCl2, [Bmim][Br]+KOH), on reaction yield, a series of catalyst 
amount with various catalyst ratio, 2:1, 6:1 an 10:1, were prepared and used as catalysts for the 
reactions. The results for the fixation reaction, demonstrated in Figure 1, show that the 
[Bmim]Br/ZnCl2 ratio and their amount both affect the carbonate yield. From the trends of these 
curves, it shows that, as catalyst ratio remains constant, the yield increases with the increase of total 
catalyst amount, and the reaction yield for catalyst ratio 2:1 is the best over the other two, 6:1 and 10:1.

reactions with pressure ranging 15 ~ 50 atm, in which the reactions are not under mass transfer control. 
 
Influence of reaction temperature  
To study the temperature effect, the reaction was carried out at various temperatures. The results 
are illustrated in Figure 3. It was found that the yield was strongly affected by the reaction temperature. 
The PC yield increased with the increase of the reaction temperature, and the trend becomes slower 
after 120oC. As for the amine carbonylation reaction, it became slower after 150 oC and reached as 
high as 69.0% for a temperature up to 180 oC. The solubility of CO2 in ionic liquid decreased with an 
increase of temperature. From the curve trends, the increased reaction rates at higher temperatures 
more than offset the lower CO2 solubility, and temperature dependence upon the Arrhenius equation 
can be clearly observed. 
 
Kinetic analysis 
From previous observations, it was deemed advisable that these reactions are under kinetic 
control within studied conditions. The effects of reaction time on the conversions of PO and 
cyclohexylamine were carried out, and found that the conversion increases with reaction time for every 
temperature condition. Since the reaction was conducted under constant CO2 pressure, constant 
solubility of CO2 in the reaction medium was assumed. These conversion data, derived from triplicate 
batch experiments, were collected and fitted using first order kinetics: -ln(1-x) = k’t, where x is the 
conversion, t time period and k’ is the rate constant (hr-1), obtained according to the regression line 
slope in the plot of the minus nature log (1-conversion) versus reaction time. Figure 4A is the fixation 
reaction carried out at 80, 100 and 120oC, and 4B the carbonylation reaction at 120, 130, 150 and 
180oC. These plots show a good linear character of a first -order reaction kinetics. The rate constants 
(with r2), expressed as k’(r2), calculated from the slopes of plots are: 0.2184(0.8834), 0.4215(0.9943) 
and 0.8312 (0.9755) hr-1 for the fixation reaction at 80, 100 and 120oC respectively, and 
0.0742(0.9675), 0.0984(0.9842) , 0.1177(0.9384) and 0.209(0.899) hr-1 for carbonylation reaction at 
120, 130 150 and 180oC respectively. The r2 is the correlation fit constant for the regressions of the 
data associated with each reaction. The activation energy for both reactions was also calculated by 
using the Arrhenius equation with similar linear plot, lnk’ = lnko – E/RT, where E is the activation 
energy, T temperature, R gas constant, and ko is pre-exponential constant (hr-1). The activation energy 
for the fixation reaction was then estimated as 9.152 kcal/mol (r2: 0.999), which is very close to that of
