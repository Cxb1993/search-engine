Fig. 3 is the seismic data at offshore 
Trinadad with 48 traces and 2050 points in 
each trace. The sampling rate is 0.004 
seconds. The data are from Seismic Unix 
System developed by Colorado School of 
Mine [9].The input seismogram in Fig. 3 
passes through the thresholding. For seismic 
data s( ix , it ),  481 ≤≤ ix , 20501 ≤≤ it , we 
set a threshold l. If s( ix , it ) ≥ l, data become 
the object points, xi = [xi  ti]T, i=1, 2, …, n. 
Fig. 4 is the thresholding result. Then the 
data are fed into the network. 
The adopted HTNN consists of three 
layers: distance layer, activation function 
layer, and the total error layer. The network 
is shown in Fig. 5. It is an unsupervised and 
competitive network capable of detecting m 
parameterized objects: lines and hyperbolas, 
simultaneously.

(2) 討論: 
“Seismic data processing and 
recognition system” uses HTNN to detect 
line pattern of direct wave and hyperbola 
pattern of reflection wave in a one-shot 
seismogram. The parameter learning rule is 
derived by gradient descent method to 
minimize the error. We calculate the 
distance from point to line. Also we define 
the vertical time difference as the distance 
from point to hyperbola that makes the 
learning feasible. In experiments, we get fast 
convergence in simulated data because three 
parameters are considered in the hyperbolic 
detection. The detection results can improve 
seismic interpretation. 
In the real seismic applications, 
preprocessing is an important step, and its 
result is quite critical for the input-output 
relation. Deconvolution, envelope, and 
wavelet processing may be needed in the 
preprocessing to improve the detection 
result.

Neural network for parameters determination and seismic pattern detection

Summary 
 
Neural network can determine the parameters of line and 
hyperbola. So it is adopted to detect line pattern of direct 
wave and hyperbola pattern of reflection wave in a 
seismogram. The distance calculation from point to 
hyperbola is calculated from the time difference. This 
calculation makes the parameter learning feasible. The 
neural network can calculate the total error for distance 
from point to patterns. The parameter learning rule is 
derived by gradient descent method to minimize the total 
error. Experimental results show that line and hyperbola 
can be detected in simulated seismic data. The detection 
results can improve the seismic interpretation. 
 
Introduction 
 
Seismic pattern recognition plays an important role in oil 
exploration. In a one-shot seismogram in Figure 1, the 
travel-time curve of direct wave pattern is a straight line 
and the reflection wave pattern is a hyperbola. Hough 
transform (HT) was used to detect parameterized shapes by 
find the peak value (maximum) in the parameter space 
(Hough, 1962; Duda et. al., 1972). Huang et al. (1985) had 
applied the Hough transform to detect direct wave (line 
pattern) and reflection wave (hyperbola pattern) in a one-
shot seismogram. However, it was not easy to determine 
the peak in the parameter space. Also, efficiency and 
memory consumption are serious drawbacks. 
 
Neural network was developed to parameters determination. 
The Hough transform neural network (HTNN) was 
designed for detecting lines, circles, and ellipses (Basak et. 
al., 2002, 2003; Dempsey et. al., 1992). But there is no 
application to hyperbola detection. Here, the HTNN is 
adopted to detect the line pattern of direct wave and 
hyperbola pattern of reflection wave in a one-shot 
seismogram. The determination of parameters is by neural 
network, not by the mapping to the parameter space. 
 
Proposed System and Preprocessing 
 
Figure 1 shows the simulated one-shot seismogram with 64 
traces and every trace has 512 points. The sampling rate is 
0.004 seconds. The size of the input data is 64×512. The 
proposed detection system is shown in Figure 2. 
The input seismogram in Figure 1 passes through the 
thresholding. For seismic data, S(xi, ti), 1 ≤ xi ≤ 64, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 
512, we set a threshold T. For |S(xi, ti)| ≥ T, data become 
xi=[xi ti]T, i=1, 2, …, n. Figure 3 is the thresholding result, 
where n is 252. Data are preprocessed at first, and then fed 
into the network.

Neural network for parameters determination and seismic pattern detection 
 
we have x0,k = 0 in (2). So the parameter vector pk is [ ak  bk  
t0,k ]T and by (7) which implies parameter adjustment of x0 
is zero. 
 
Similar to Basak (2002), in the learning process, we use 
two stage learning and the convergence can be fast. In the 
first stage, we only change the bias bk of the line in (6), and 
(x0,k, t0,k) of the hyperbola in (7) until there is no significant 
change in the output error. In the second stage, we adjust 
all parameters of line in (6) and hyperbola in (7). 
The flowchart of the learning system is shown in Figure 5. 
The object number m is 2, one is line and the other is 
hyperbola. Initially set up random parameter vectors. Then 
input data and adjust the parameter vector as (6) and (7). 
Finally, if the average error is less than a threshold, Eth, 
then the learning stops.

Seismic Experiments 
 
The HTNN is applied to the simulated seismic data. In a 
simulated one-shot seismogram, the reflection layer is flat, 
that means x0 = 0, so three parameters are detected for 
hyperbola. 
 
The image space of simulated one-shot seismogram in 
Figure 1 is 64×512. The data are generated by the direct 
wave and reflection wave formulas for flat layer (Slotnick, 
1959; Dobrin, 1976; Yilmaz, 1987). After preprocessing, 
the input data in Figure 6 have 252 points. Table 1 shows 
the detected parameters of line and hyperbola in the image 
space. The experimental results are shown in Figure 6 and 
7. We choose that β equals to 0.05, σ equals to 
15/log2(1+iteration), and error threshold (Eth) equals to 10-5. 
Figure 6 shows the result of detection of direct wave and 
reflection wave in the x-t space. Figure 7 shows the error 
versus iteration number, where the dotted line means it 
takes 12 iterations to change to stage two. Comparing the 
detection results with the original seismogram, the result of 
experiment is quite successful.

Conclusions 
 
HTNN is adopted to detect line pattern of direct wave and 
hyperbola pattern of reflection wave in a seismogram. The 
parameter learning rule is derived by gradient descent 
method to minimize the error. We use the direct line 
equation in the distance calculation from point to line. Also 
we define the vertical time difference as the distance from 
point to hyperbola that makes the learning feasible. In 
experiments, we get fast convergence in simulated data 
because three parameters are considered in the hyperbola 
detection. The detection results can improve seismic 
interpretation. 
 
The result of preprocessing is quite critical for the input-
output relation. More wavelet, envelope, and deconvolution 
processing may be needed in the preprocessing to improve 
the detection result.
