Abstract 
         Using the micro-cavity structure to design the full-color organic light-emitting diodes 
(OLEDs) flat panel is proposed. By the ability of micro-cavity of reconciling the color with 
white-light emission, we can control the thickness of the hole injection layer to mediate the 
optical length and get the light of red, green and blue without using the color filter. This study 
simplifies the traditional manufacture process of the full-color OLED flat panel.  
 
1 Introduction 
 Organic electroluminescent (EL) devices have 
attracted great interest because of their potential 
applicability to fullcolor at panel displays, for 
example, due to wide spectral range, low driving 
voltage, light weight or other characteristics for 
portable display devices. In recent years, steady 
progress is being made towards a full color OLED 
display. Prototypes have been demonstrated or 
reported by multiple research organizations, each of 
which took a different approach to fabrication of the 
display. For example, the first approach uses white 
OLEDs with color filter arrays for the backlight of the 
LCDs [1,2]. The second one uses blue OLEDs for 
light source with fluorescent color arrays named 
Color-Changing Media to obtain RGB colors [3]. The 
third approach employs patterned lateral RGB 
emitters which we adopt this method to make a full 
color display [4]. Other methods have been explored, 
such as stacked RGB cells [5,6], color changed 
emitters by photo-bleaching [7,8], and ink-jet printing 
of doped polymer emitters [9]. However, all of these 
approaches have both merits and demerits. In 
consideration of the application of OLED flat panel, 
full-color is one of the necessary components to 
succeed in the market. All above three methods have 
shortage on color saturation, emission efficiency or 
process of manufacture. Therefore, this study use the 
white emission layer with controlling the length of 
optics of micro-cavity respectively to manufacture 
OLED flat panel that has easier process of 
manufacture and high color purity. 
 Cavity optoelectronic devices have attracted much 
attention in controlling the spontaneous emission 
since 1990 [10-13]. Optical cavities are the resonators 
that have at least one dimension at the same order of a 
single-optical wavelength. These structures 
redistribute the optical-mode density along the optical

The micro-cavity effect can be controlled by changing 
the thickness of the HIL (x Å) to manufacture the 
bottom-emitting full-color OLED flat panel with red, 
green and blue light.

3 Results and discussion 
 In our bottom emitting micro-cavity OLED, the 
reflective cathode and the semi-reflective anode metal 
layer serve as the rear and front mirrors, respectively. 
All ITO layers, hole injection layers (HILs), emission 
layers (EMLs), and electron transporting layers (ETLs) 
between the mirrors are highly transparent, thus we 
neglect their absorptions. From the viewpoint of 
classical optics, the working principle of the micro-
cavity OLEDs may be simplified as a Fabry–Perot 
cavity in which there is an electrically stimulated 
emission layer. The external emission spectrum 
intensity I(λ) of the micro-cavity at wavelength λ is 
calculated by formula (1):  
 
 
 
 where IO(λ) is the emission spectrum intensity of 
the light emitting diode in the free space, L is the total 
optical length of the micro-cavity, Z is the effective 
optical distance between the emission layer and rear 
mirror, Rf and Rr are the reflectivity of the semi-
reflective front mirror and the total-reflective mirror, 
respectively. The light is designed to exit through the 
front mirror. After taking into account the effective 
penetration depth into the metal, the total optical 
length of the micro-cavity, L, is expressed by formula 
(2):  
 
 
  
 
where ni and li are the refractive index and the 
thickness of an organic layer or the ITO layer, 
denoted by i., and φm is the phase shift at the metal 
mirrors. φm is given by formula (3):  
 
 
 
 
 
where nm and km are the real and imaginary parts of 
the refractive index of the metal mirror, and ns is the 
refractive index of the material in contact with the 
metal. The values of these refractive indexes are 
wavelength dependent. 
 The bottom-emitting RGB full-color OLED with 
microcavity structure was shown in Fig. 1. The hole 
injection layer is m-MTDATA : F4-TCNQ (3%), we 
set the HIL thickness in blue, green and red light pixel 
is 55 nm, 75 nm, and 105 nm, respectively. The 
structure of the white emission zone  is NPB : 
Rubrene (200 Å) / BAlq : TBPe (200 Å), and the 
electron transport layer is Alq3 (250 nm). The total-

different color of the emission. Fig. 5 shows the 
luminous intensity-circuit density-luminous 
efficiency. We find that when the circuit density is 
set at 20 mA/cm2, the luminous intensity of blue, 
green, red and white OLED are 1124, 1041, 1002, 
and 1178 cd/m2 respectively, and the luminous 
efficiency are 5.6, 5.2, 5.0 and 5.9 cd/A respectively.

4 Conclusions 
 We have demonstrated tunable light emission from a 
cavity OLEDs using an anode as one mirror and cathode 
as a second mirror. Three primary colors—RGB—have 
been designed and obtained by using 
NPB:Rubrene/Balq:TBPe as a common white emission 
layer. Three possible schemes to implement RGB pixels 
with one white emission layer have been presented and 
discussed. Our optical simulation agrees well with the 
experimental emission spectra. The spectral narrowing 
and intensity enhancement at the resonance wavelength 
have been observed, and are explained by the 
redistribution of optical-mode density in the cavity.
