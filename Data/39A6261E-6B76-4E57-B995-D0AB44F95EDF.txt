3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 X-ray diffraction of FeCoNiCrCu0.5 alloy 
℃ and 1350℃ phase transformation show in Fig 3. 
 
analysis 
The X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) of the FeCoNiCrCu0.5  
alloy system with difference temperature are show in Fig 1,  
the result indicates that only a simple solid solution phase of 
FCC crystal structure. The Lattice constant of this 
perk as 3.562 oΑ .

3.2 Microstructure of SEM and TEM analysis 
The SEM backscattered electron images of the alloy 
system with difference temperature are show in Fig 2 These 
photos indicated that the second phase segregation of this 
alloy occurred at various temperatures. The matrix phase 
(MP) and second phase of Cu-rich phase (TP-D and TP-C) 
and Cr-rich phase (SP) were observed in the specimen of 
as-cast and heat-treated at 950℃ high entropy alloy has 
Cu-Cr rich and Cu-rich phase described above all solidify 
phase to form a matrix phase(MP) nevertheless, When  
temperature existed 1000℃to 1350℃ will be changed into 
high Cr-rich and high Cu-rich phase. Their chemical 
compositions by EDX are given in Table 1. Therefore TEM 
microstructure information measurements were carried out 
on of the FeCoNiCrCu0.5 high entropy alloy of as-cast, 950 
Table .1 the chemical composition of the ingot FeCoNiCrCu0.5 alloy system 
was calculated form the principal

3.3 Hardness analysis 
Table 2 show the hardness values of FeCoNiCrCu0.5 
high entropy alloy system. The alloys has similar hardness 
values from 152 to174 HV in the following difference
