2communication [5]. To support safety communication, direct vehicular communication using ad hoc network in
organizing a local peer group (LPG) for real-time IVC were proposed in [6]. In [7], the authors proposed an
Optimized Disseminating Alarm Messages (ODAM) protocol to support localization of GPS-unequipped vehicle in
vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET). Parker and Valaee [8] present a novel cooperative vehicle position estimation
algorithm by utilizing inter-vehicle distance measurements taken by a radio-ranging technique. The authors claimed
that the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher accuracy and more reliability than the existing GPS-based method.
Based on a Kalman prediction algorithm that received updated position and velocity estimates from deployed sensors,
King et at. [9] proposed a Wireless Intersection Collision Avoidance System (WICAS) to help mitigate collision at
intersections, particularly rural highway intersections. Another intersection collision avoidance system is proposed in
[10], which employs the DSRC technology to build an intelligent intersection traffic system (IITS). The IITS allows
vehicle On Board Unit (OBU) to establish secure links with the Roadside Unit (RSU) installed in the intersection
before entering the region and exchange their status information.
In this study, a collaborative active safety system using high precision GPS and WAVE for collision avoidance
pre-warning with audio and visual effect is designed and developed. The major advantage of the proposed collision
avoidance system is its capability to sense the moving vehicles without suffering blind corner as some optical-based
collision avoidance system has. The detailed design and development of the proposed system is discussed in the
following sections.
3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Figure 1 shows the schematic scenario of the GPSenseCar. When the vehicle equipped with GPSenseCar is
moving toward pedestrians or vehicles nearby, the driver’s in-vehicle OBU of the GPSenseCar will start to horn with
different tones according to the estimated degree of danger as calculating from the received location and velocity
information from the moving object’s smart phone. This GPSenseCar consists of two components, which is
in-vehicle and cell phone platform. The components, how the collision risk is assessed, and the functional
requirement of the GPSenseCar are described as below.
Figure1: Schematic diagram of the GPSenseCar system
3.1 In-vehicle platform
The in-vehicle platform is composed by an on-board unit (OBU) with a built-in GPS receiver and an access point
(AP) for WAVE. The WAVE AP will organize a Hotspot within a radius about 1000 meters. Any vehicle equipped
with such a system will create a wireless local area network to receive the positions and velocities data emitted from
end users’smart phones. The OBU will calculate every received object’s relative position, velocity, and moving
direction, and give different warning sound with visual effect for the direction of the moving objects to the vehicle
driver according to the degree of danger the vehicle might encounter.
3.2 Smart phone platform
When the WAVE smart phone users have access to the AP, the AP will give the smart phone an IP address, which
enables the smart phone to be connected to the WAVE network. The smart phone will transmit the position and
velocity data, received by the built-in GPS receiver, to the in-vehicle GPSenseCar OBU through the WAVE network.
The in-vehicle OBU then can calculate the relative position, velocity, and moving direction of the moving objects.
The complete system block diagram of the GPSenseCar is depicted in Figure 2, where PCM7230 is the embedded
system we used for experiment.
45. The system shall identify a non-moving object, i.e. with zero velocity vectors, which is also not in the direction
of the moving vehicle, as an invalid client.
4. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
The proposed GPSenseCar is designed using an embedded system for the in-vehicle platform, while the smart
phone with GPS receiver and WAVE is used as user terminal. To simulate the WAVE and GPS smart phone, a Wifi
PDA with external GPS receiver connection is used. The VB.NET and .NET compact framework of the Visual
Studio 2003 .NET are employed in designing the software of the system. The design of the in-vehicle platform and
the user terminal are described as below.
4.1 In-vehicle platform：
Schematic diagram of the in-vehicle platform, which consists of a PCM 7230 from Advantech®, a Wifi LAN
card, and a GPS receiver, is depicted in Figure 4 as below.

Figure 5 shows the PCM7230 embedded platform, whose specification is the following.

The Hotspot, created by access point in the GPSenseCar, builds a wireless LAN using IEEE802.11b/g physical
layer, and received GPS position, speed, and direction of other Wifi user terminals in the Hotspot via socket. The
DI624 access point from D-Link® is used in this project in establishing the Hotspot. A 10dbi antenna is used to
ensure the 100 meter range of the wireless LAN can be achieved. Limited by the precision of GPS, this system
considers collision risk from a distance about 50 meters. The GPSenseCar is intending to compensate the drawback
of current optical-based safety system for car such that the following risk scenarios are considered.
1. User terminals that moving in the same direction and is calculated to be collided in five seconds will be
considered as dangerous object.
6Timer1_Timer() Access the buffer of the defined COM port for the client GPS data every 0.2 second
parseRMC() Obtain the time, position, and velocity data from the COM port according to the NMEA-0183
protocol. Send the data to the server program for UDP processing
stop_Click() Stop reading GPS data and close the network connection
ServerSocket_D
ataArrival()
Main program. Process the UDP packet and call parseRMC() according to NMEA-0183 to obtain
GPS data. And call Synchronizing(), Mapping() and Warning() function to process and calculate
the obtained client data.
Mapping() Display the user terminal and the vehicle’s positions to the digital map according to the positional
data of vehicle and user terminal.
Warning() Use the collision risk equation to calculate the risk of collision and to give different warning tone
according to the degree of danger.
Synchronizing() Use extrapolation to predict the delayed time between in-vehicle platform and the user terminal to
synchronize and compensate the communication lag time.
4.2 User terminal platform
Schematic diagram of the user terminal platform is depicted in Figure 8 as below. The PDA with built-in Wifi and
connected Garmin® GPS18 5Hz GPS receiver is used to simulate the smart phone. The Garmin® GPS18 5Hz is
used to ensure that the GPS data can be updated every 0.2 second such that the real-time requirement of the collision
avoidance is satisfied. The software design of the user terminal is to process the GPS data received from the GPS
receiver and to transmit the GPS data to the in-vehicle GPSenseCar. Before the data can be transmitted to the
in-vehicle platform, the Wifi smart phone must connect to the Hotspot organized by the in-vehicle OBU. Figure 9
shows the software flowchart of the user terminal. The simulated smart phone and the graphical user interface of the
user terminal platform are shown in Figure 10(a) and 10(b), respectively. The speed, positional, and directional
information of the user terminal is displayed in the GUI. Software subroutine of the user terminal is show in Table 2.

85. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The experiment took place in an open area with intersections near the campus of the National Chiayi University
(NCYU). Figure 10 shows the experimental arrangement of the real road test for the GPSenseCar. The vehicle
equipped with GPSenseCar is shown in Figure 10 (a), where the antenna for the GPS and the wireless AP are at the
left and right window side, respectively. Figure 11 (b) and (c) shows the user terminal mounted on a bicycle and the
OBU and its user graphical interface and peripherals, respectively.
There are six test scenarios under 4 road environments in the experiment. The four road test environments are the
following.
1. The front car stops suddenly: The car in front of the GPSenseCar vehicle suddenly stops. The in-vehicle
OBU shall give pre-warning sound and the vehicle horn for the front stopped vehicle will follow.
2. GPSenseCar vehicle suddenly stops while the vehicle follows does not notice: When the GPSenseCar
vehicle stops, to prevent the vehicle follows bump into the GPSenseCar vehicle, the GPSenseCar vehicle
should automatically horn to warn the vehicle follows.
3. Two vehicles meet at intersection without traffic light or stop sign: It is possible the collision will happen
if both vehicles do not slowdown in such intersection. The OBU shall give pre-warning sound for
GPSenseCar user, and in subsequence the car horn will cry out to notify the other driver.
4. Pedestrian crossing the street: In case the pedestrian is crossing the street, the OBU will give pre-warning
sound for the GPSenseCar user and the car horn will cry out to notify the Pedestrian.

signal is tested by reading and analyzing GGA sentence according to GPS NMEA0183
