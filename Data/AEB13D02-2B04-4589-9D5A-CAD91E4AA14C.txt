2waveguides by O2 reactive ion etching using
azobenzene polymers as the etching mask. But,
for these techniques surface scattering loss is
often induced due to the surface roughness
caused by the physical etching process, and
high aspect ratio of the grating patterns is not
easy to be obtained by this process [15-16].
The electron-beam direct-writing method has
been used to inscribe the polymeric ridge
waveguide with a corrugated sidewall Bragg
grating [17]. This design is superior to the
conventional buried grating for controlling the
effective index modulation. It also showed
good transmission dip for very short grating
length. However, the core size must be very
small to have the single mode condition, since
the core index of their waveguide is much
larger than the surrounding cladding index.
This condition will cause the coupling
difficulty between the waveguides and ordinary
fibers. Ahn et al fabricated Bragg grating filters
using the nanoimprint technique [18]. In their
approach, they fabricated a UV transparent
quartz stamp and using a nanoimprint machine
to successfully transfer the grating pattern onto
the polymer layer. The process is cost effective
and resultsin simplicity to fabricate a stamp.
But, there are some drawbacks that have been
explicitly mentioned in Ref.19. These
drawbacks may restrict the use of this method
in fabricating a Bragg grating filter. Kocabas et
al reported the fabrication of a grating on OG
146 polymer using e-beam direct writing and
stamp transfer techniques [19]. Then, a BCB
polymeric ridge waveguide was fabricated on
the grating using reaction ion etching
technique. The grating fabrication process is
similar to our previous work except for the
e-beam writing technique [20]. The
experimental results showed good replication
for the grating through the process. However,
the physical etching process may cause large
scattering losses from the sidewall of
waveguides. We have recently demonstrated a
process to rapidly produce submicron range
gratings by using both micro-molding and
holographic interference techniques. A large
aspect ratio of 0.7:1 between the depth and the
period on the grating pattern could be obtained,
and consistent reproduction of the grating on a
UV polymer could be achieved with this
process [20]. In this paper, we demonstrate a
method to inscribe surface-relief gratings on
polymer channel waveguides without any
physical etching process.
There are a number of simple methods to
fabricate polymer waveguides that include
techniques involving photocrosslinking [21],
photobleaching [22-23], reactive ion etching
[24-25], photolocking [26] and laser/electron
beam writing [27, 28]. Some techniques have
inherent limitations; for example reactive ion
etching can incur excessive scattering losses
[24, 25], and laser beam writing is not suitable
for mass-production [27]. Other techniques
such as hot embossing [29], UV-embossing
[30], and micro-transfer molding method are
also becoming more popular due to their
simple fabrication procedure [31-32]. However,
these methods have problems to overcome;
such as residual material problems and limited
substrate and core materials available [29-32].
We have recently developed a soft lithography
method to replicate polymer waveguides [33].
In this method, the waveguides are produced
by a two-step molding process where a master
mold is first formed on a negative tone
photoresist and subsequently transferred to a
PDMS mold. The silicone rubber mold is then
used as a stamp to transfer the final waveguide
pattern onto a UV curing epoxy. High aspect
ratio (depth/ width) and vertical waveguide
sidewalls could be obtained by this method.
三、研究報告內容
In this paper, we will describe a technique
that combines the holographic interferometry,
soft lithography, and a simple replication
processes to create a high resolution and high
aspect ratio grating structure on a polymer
waveguide. In order to reduce the residual
stress caused by different thermal expansion
coefficients in the core and cladding material,
similar polymer materials with slightly
different index are used for the core and
cladding layers. The material has a refractive
index between 1.52~1.56 (OG146=1.5201, and
OG154=1.5668) at wavelength 1550nm, which
is close to the refractive index of optical fiber
(about 1.46-1.50).
1. Grating Fabrication
Rapid prototyping of grating structures on
a polymer substrate involving a three-step
process was performed first. A grating pattern
is holographically exposed using a two-beam
interference pattern on a positive photoresist
4outright absence of a guided mode for the
asymmetric waveguide structure, the upper
cladding layer was used.
The same UV epoxy (OG146) was
deposited using the fabricating procedure
described in the previous section (Fig. 2(k)-(n)).
A spacer with thickness of 410μm was placed 
between the sample and a thin Pyrex glass
slide. After injecting the precure UV polymer
(OG146) into the opening between the mold
and the glass slide, UV light was used to
crosslink the polymer. The sample were diced
and the end-faces were then polished, such that
the final polymeric wavelength filter has
dimensions of 4cm in length, 1cm in width and
about 410μm in thickness (Fig. 2(n)). The near
field patterns of the optical waveguide were
observed using the end-fire coupling technique.
Figure 6 shows the schematic diagram of the
measurement system. An amplified
spontaneous emission (ASE) source with a
wavelength range from 1530 to 1560 nm was
used as the wide band light source (Stabilized
Light Source, PTS-BBS, Newport Inc., USA).
The light source was polarized in the TE
direction using the in-line polarizer (ILP-55-N,
Advanced Fiber Resources, China), which was
followed by a polarization controller with
operation wavelength around 1550nm
(F-POL-PC, Newport Inc., USA). The output
mode field of the waveguide was observed
using an IR CCD system (Model 7290A,
Micron Viewer, Electrophysics Inc., U.S.A.)
with image analysis software (LBA-710PC-D,
V4.17, Spiricon Inc., USA). The measured
mode field pattern of the
waveguide is depicted in Fig.7, which show the
single-mode characteristics of the waveguide.
The waveguide properties including the
mode pattern and the effective index were
simulated using the beam propagation method
(BPM_CAD, Opti-Wave Inc., Canada). The
effective index of the waveguide is 1.5447
from the simulation. The Bragg wavelength is
1553.9 nm as calculated from the Bragg
reflection condition for the filter with a grating
period of 503nm. The transmission of the
optical filter was also calculated by using
coupled mode theory [37]. The calculated
transmission minimum of the optical filter is
-19.5dB. The spectral characteristics of the
optical filter were measured using an optical
spectrum analyzer (Q8384 Optical Spectrum
Analyzer, Advantest Inc., Japan). Again, an
amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) light
source with a wavelength range from 1530 to
1560 nm was used as the wide band light
source. An alignment He-Ne laser source, as
the auxiliary source, was combined with the
wide band source using a 2×1 optical fiber
coupler. The optical filter was set on a
micro-positioner, and two single mode fibers
were used as the input and output fibers. The
input light source was polarized in the TE
direction as was the mode field measurement
system. The output fiber, then, was connected
to the optical spectrum analyzer to characterize
the filter performance. The measured result is
shown in Fig.8. At the Bragg wavelength, a
transmission dip of–18.5 dB was obtained, and
the 3-dB-transmission bandwidth was about
8nm. The Bragg wavelength _B is given as
_B=2NeffΛ, where Neff, can be calculated
using the beam propagation method, is the
effective index of the waveguide grating and _
is the period of grating. The measured Bragg
wavelength is 1554.02 nm, which is off by
0.12nm from the theoretical prediction. When
the core refractive index ranges from 1.549 to
1.551 for the mixing ratio of OG154 ranging
from Vol.45% to 55%, the calculated Bragg
wavelength by the beam propagation method
varies from 1552.9 to 1554.8 nm. The
technique described in this paper can also be
applied to the fabrication of asymmetric Bragg
couplers (ABC) [38], which can be utilized as
optical add/drop multiplexer (OADM)
elements in dense wavelength division
multiplexing (DWDM) systems. The
possibility of fabricating ABC waveguide
filters is illustrated in Fig.9. The fabrication
procedure is the same as the above-mentioned
process, and the only difference is the
PET-based mask designed. This result shows
that parallel polymeric waveguide filters can
be possibly designed and fabricated.
四、Conclusion
In conclusion, we have successfully
created a process to rapidly produce submicron
range gratings on polymer waveguides by
using holographic interference techniques, soft
Lithography, and micro molding. A large
aspect ratio grating pattern could be obtained
with consistent reproduction of the grating on a
UV polymer waveguide could be produced.

Abstract
In this paper, we proposed a method to fabricate an
Dshaped fiber of surface-relief Bragg grating filter by
utilizing D-shaped fiber polishing along with
photolithography and holographic interference
lithography technologies.
Introduction
Optical fibers now play an important role in
communications and sensing, and in the future that role
will only expand with the increasing prominence of
optical signals in communication and sensing.
The main advantages of optical fibers in communication
and sensing are that they have very low loss, very large
bandwidth, immune to electromagnetic interference,
electrically inert, very light weight, and the signals they
carry can have very little power. In addition, many
signals or sensing points can be multipexed onto a single
fiber.
These advantages have resulted in optical fibers
supplanting metal wires in many communications and
sensing applications [1, 2].
The most common type of optical fiber senser is the
optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG). The FBG reflects a
specific wavelength of light that changes based on the
surrounding conditions.The shift in the reflected light
can be correlated back to a number of different
environmental variables such as temperature, strain, or
pressure.
The reflectivity of a FBG depends on the length of the
grating, the amplitude of the periodic index modulation,
and the amount of overlap between the grating and the
field of the guided mode in the fiber. This overlap is
quantified as the fraction of the modal field profile that
falls in the phyaical area where the index modulation
occurs. In these standard FBGs, UV exposure changes
the refractive index of the core by a small amount,
usually from 10-5 to 10-3 of the pre-exposure refractive
index [3], however, the modulation occurs over the entire
cross-section of the fiber core, thus creating a large
overlap between the grating and field of the guided mode.
This large overlap means that at the specified
Bragg wavelength and with a sufficiently long grating,
reflectivity of nearly 100% can be achieved. While this
method can produce highly reflective gratings they are
not well suited for many sensing applications. For
example, because the gratings are created in the core of
the fiber, interaction with the surrounding environment is
limited.
More recently it has been shown that gratings can be
written with reactive ion etcher and CF4 plasma on
Dshaped
