of the PEDOT/FePc/MWCNT-modified SPCE were found to 
be 638 mA cm-2 M-1 and 71 nM, respectively. The 
developed sensor was also applied for determining 
nitrite in tap water samples.

potentials. In order to overcome these 
problems, some electrochemically modified 
electrodes based on metal oxides [1-2], 
metalloporphyrin [3-4], conducting polymers 
[5-6], and Au and Pt nanoparticles [7-9] have 
been explored to lower the sensing potentials 
for nitrite oxidation. 
Due to their interesting redox properties, 
the transition metal phthalocyanine (MPc) 
complexes have been used as sensing 
materials for nitrite detection [10-11]. The 
overpotential for nitrite oxidation at the 
MPc-modified electrodes is still rather high. A 
possible method to reduce overpotential of 
nitrite oxidation below 0.6 V is to make a 
composite of MPc with 
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 
and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). 
MWCNT has numerous attractive 
properties, such as promoting the electron 
transfer rate and electrocatalytic activity for a 
wide range of important species [12]. Recently, 
MWCNT has been employed to modify the 
electrodes for nitrite detection [13-14]. 
Conducting polymers (CPs) have also been 
attractive materials for the detection of several 
biomolecules. Among all the CPs, PEDOT has 
received particular attention for the 
electroanalytical application, e.g., detection of 
chemical and biomolecules such as uric acid 
and cysteine [15-16]. 
In our previous work, electrocatalytic 
properties of the PEDOT/MWCNT-modified 
SPCE have been investigated and significant 
decrease of overpotential was observed for the 
oxidation of nitrite [17]. Although the 
PEDOT/MWCNT-modified SPCE has good 
sensitivity and low limit of detection (LOD), 
the sensing potential of nitrite is still high, 
which could invite interfering substances 
easily. Consequently, it is our attempt to 
enhance properties like LOD, sensitivity, and 
sensing potential for the oxidation of nitrite, 
by incorporating iron phthalocyanine (FePc) to 
the PEDOT/MWCNT-modified SPCE. 
2. Experimental 
2.1 Chemicals and instruments 
Metal phthalocyanines (MPcs, M: Cu (II), 
Fe (III), Mn (II), Ni (II)) complexes, 
(2-hydroxypropyl)-cyclodextrin (H-β-CD), and 
EDOT were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 
Sodium nitrite was obtained from 
Riedel-deHaen. MWCNT was purchased from 
Nanotech Port Co. (Taiwan). Deionized water 
was used throughout this work. 
Electrochemical measurements were carried 
out using a CHI 440 electrochemical 
workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., USA) with 
a conventional three-electrode system. A 
three-electrode type screen printed carbon 
electrode (SPCE) (Zensor R&D, Taiwan) was 
used for the sensor preparation. The working 
electrode, reference electrode, and counter 
electrode on the SPCE are carbon electrode, 
Ag/AgCl wire and carbon electrode, 
respectively. 
2.2 Preparation of MPc, FePc/MWCNT, and 
PEDOT/FePc/MWCNT-modified SPCEs 
To prepare FePc/MWCNT-modified 
electrode, a MWCNT suspension with the 
concentration of 1 mg mL
-1
 was first prepared 
by suspending MWCNT in DMF solution with 
the aid of ultrasonication. After preparing the 
suspension, 1 μL (one drop) of the MWCNT 
suspension was drop-casted on the surface of 
the electrodes and was then dried at 60 °C. 
Subsequently, 1 μL of the FePc solution with 
concentration of 4 mg mL
-1
 were drop-casted 
on the surface of the electrodes and were then 
dried at 60 °C. PEDOT film was then 
electrodeposited onto the 
FePc/MWCNT-modified SPCE by using the 
cyclic voltammetric (CV) method. Typically, 
the FePc/MWCNT modified SPCE was 
immersed in aqueous solution containing 10 
mM EDOT, 0.5 mM H-β-CD and 100 mM 
LiClO4, and the potential was scanned 
between 0 and 0.95 V at a rate of 50 mV s
-1
 
for specific cycles. 
2.3 Amperometric detection of nitrite 
Considering the sensitivity and the 
steadiness of the 
PEDOT/FePc/MWCNT-modified SPCE, the 
suitable sensing potential was determined as 
0.5 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The current densities in 
the concentration range between 2.5 and 200 
μM were collected and calibration curve for 
nitrite was established. 
3. Results and discussion

3.3 Determination of an optimum 
concentration of FePc 
The optimum concentration of FePc was 
determined for oxidation of nitrite by 
drop-casting it on SPCE. As shown in Fig. 3, a 
significant shift in Epa was noticed toward the 
negative side as the concentration of FePc was 
increased from 0 to 4 mg mL
-1
. It should be 
noted that FePc was precipitated as its 
concentration was higher than 4 mg mL
-1
. As a 
result, 4 mg mL
-1
 was chosen for following 
experiments.

solution for film preparation on the Jpa and 
Epa. 
3.4 Determination of an optimum bilayer 
number of FePc/MWCNT 
Since MWCNT has some important 
properties, such as high 
surface-area-to-volume ratio, facilitating 
electron transfer, and good electrocatalytic 
properties to nitrite, an under-layer of 
MWCNT was introduced to the FePc film 
with an intention of increasing the active 
surface and facilitating the electron transfer 
between FePc and the SPCE, thus improving 
the elecrocatalytic properties of the 
FePc-modified SPCE. As shown in Fig. 4, 
after introducing a layer of MWCNT, a shift in 
Epa to the negative side and an increase in Jpa 
were noticed. Besides, when the number of 
FePc/MWCNT bilayer was increased from 1 
to 5, Jpa was slightly increased and Epa shifted 
about 60 mV to the negative side. However, 
the FePc/MWCNT composite film became 
unstable physically and fell off easily as the 
bilayer number was greater than 5, resulting in 
lower Jpa and higher Epa. Note that in order to 
get the optimal sensing performance, in terms 
of Epa and Jpa of the FePc/MWCNT-modified 
SPCE, it is necessary to adjust the number of 
FePc/MWCNT bilayer. The modified 
electrode with FePc/MWCNT bilayer of 5, 
designated as (FePc/MWCNT)5-modified 
SPCE, was chosen for further experiments.

3.5 Incorporation of PEDOT layers to the 
(FePc/MWCNT)5-modified SPCE 
In our previous report [17], the sensor 
response to nitrite was improved by 
electrodepositing a layer of PEDOT film onto 
the unmodified SPCE, which can be attributed 
to the preconcentration effect induced by the 
electrostatic interaction between the oxidized 
PEDOT film and nitrite. In this work, we did 
not specifically investigate the pH effect 
because our previous work indicated that the 
CV response of the PEDOT/MWCNT 
modified electrode was insensitive to the pH 
value ranging from 6-8. To enhance the sensor 
response, PEDOT film was deposited onto the 
(FePc/MWCNT)5-modified SPCE, designated 
as PEDOT1/(FePc/MWCNT)5-modified SPCE, 
and results are shown in Fig. 5. As shown in 
Fig. 5(a), a significant increase in Jpa and a 
remarkable shift in Epa to the negative side 
were noticed as a layer of PEDOT film was 
deposited onto the (FePc/MWCNT)5-modified 
SPCE. In addition, smaller Epa along with 
slightly higher Jpa was observed for nitrite 
oxidation at the 
PEDOT1/(FePc/MWCNT)5-modified SPCE 
than those at the 
PEDOT1/(MWCNT)5-modified SPCE, which 
is indicative of the electrocatalytic role of 
FePc playing in facilitating this 
electrochemical process. Compared to other 
MPc-modified electrodes [23-24], the Epa 
obtained in this work is much lower.

3.8 Interference studies and real sample 
analysis 
The interference effects of foreign ions 
on the determination of nitrite were examined 
by addition of various ions into the PBS 
solution containing 0.5 mM nitrite. It can be 
found that Na
+
, K
+
, Mg
2+
, Cl
-
, NO3
-
, SO4
2-
 
caused very slight interference effect during 
the determination of nitrite by using 
PEDOT2/(FePc/MWCNT)5-modified SPCE. 
However, 10-fold concentration of SO3
2-
 
showed serious interference. 
The PEDOT2/(FePc/MWCNT)5-modified 
SPCE was examined for real sample analysis 
in tap water. Our results were compared with 
those obtained by using the Griess method, in 
which equal volumes of 1X Griess reagent and 
tap water sample were mixed and incubated 
for 15 min. Thereafter, the concentration of 
nitrite was determined by measuring the 
absorbance at 540 nm. It can be found that the 
results obtained by our method are in good 
agreement with those obtained by the Griess 
method (Electrochemical method: RSD 2.3%, 
recovery 102%; Griess method: RSD 2.1%, 
recovery 103%; both measurements are 
conducted for 3 times). 
4. Conclusions 
The PEDOT/FePc/MWCNT-modified 
SPCEs were prepared and their application to 
the amperometric detection of nitrite was 
investigated. Owing to the synergistic effect of 
the redox properties of FePc along with the 
promoted electron transfer rate by introducing 
MWCNT and PEDOT, the overpotential for 
nitrite electrooxidation was largely reduced at 
the PEDOT/FePc/MWCNT-modified SPCE as 
compared to the unmodified SPCE. In addition, 
the current response to nitrite was also 
significantly enhanced. The low operating 
potential (~0.5 V) and LOD (~71 nM) allow 
the PEDOT/FePc/MWCNT-modified SPCE 
for practical use.
