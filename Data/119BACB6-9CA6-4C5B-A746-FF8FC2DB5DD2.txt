技術說明
英文：It was found that recovery of nitrotoluenes from wastewater was
significantly enhanced with increasing extracting temperature. Further,
high volume ratio of toluene/wastewater (= 2.0) was more beneficial to
recover nitrotoluenes, in which extractable tendency was as follows:
2,6-DNT2,4-DNT2,4,6-TNT. In addition, the recovery percentage
of TOC depended strongly upon the acidity of wastewater, wherein the
extracting efficiency at lower pH value was superior to that at higher
pH value. It is worth noting that the nitrotoluenes of wastewater would
be almost completely recovered by sequential three-stages toluene
extraction at the agitation time of 12 min and pH 3.0.

4of H2O2: Fe2+: 2,4-DNT = 20: 2.5: 1 on the molar basis. In another publication, Ho (1986)
investigated the oxidation of 2,4-DNT using UV/H2O2 and postulated the plausible reaction
pathway, composed of dinitrobenzene and dinitrobenzaldehyde intermediates. Besides, Li et al.
(1998) explored the decomposition of nitroaromatic explosives by UV/Fenton’s reagent, wherein
oxidative degradation of nitroaromatics was significantly enhanced by photochemical
regeneration of Fe2+. Based on the researches by Beltrán et al. (1998), it came to a conclusion that
ozonation of 2,6-DNT was mainly developed through free radical reactions, of which reaction
rate was accelerated by the presence of hydrogen peroxide or UV irradiation.
Several investigators paid their attention to the mineralization of 2,4,6-TNT by a
combination of H2O2 with UV irradiation (Dillert et al., 1996; Hwang et al., 2004). Some
literatures have been issued on the promoting destructive efficiency of 2,4,6-TNT using Fenton’s
reagent and visible light (Li et al., 1997). In addition, Oh et al. (2003) investigated oxidative
degradation of 2,4,6-TNT utilizing Fenton’s reagent and zero-valence iron which functioned to
reduce the nitro groups of 2,4,6-TNT to amino groups, resulting in higher destructive efficiency.
Sonochemical degradation of 2,4,6-TNT with ultrasound (20 kHz500 kHz) was carried out as a
function of substrate concentration, operating temperature and pH value (Hoffmann et al., 1996).
Currently, Liou et al. (2003) has investigated the oxidative degradation of 2,4-DNT and
2,4,6-TNT using Fenton’s reagent with UV irradiation, of which behavior likely obeyed a pseudo
first-order model.
In our previous work related to the treatment of spent acid in toluene nitration process
(Chen et al., 2005a; 2005b; 2005c), it has been found that high purity of 2,4-DNT crystal could
be recovered from spent acid by either refrigerating or diluting method. The DNT isomers and
2,4,6-TNT may be also removed from spent acid by means of hexane extraction, wherein a little
amount of water dispersed into solvent was eliminated simultaneously. Moreover, it has been
verified that the total organic compounds in spent acid could be completely mineralized by
Fenton’sreagent with optimal concentrations of H2O2 = 7.6 M and Fe2+ = 0.06 M. Until now,
numerous studies have put their attention to oxidative degradation of nitroaromatic compounds in
wastewater, wherein the organic compounds contained were disposed in useless form, whereas
the recovery manner was scarcely discussed. Therefore, this research investigated the feasibility
of recovery of nitrotoluenes from wastewater by solvent extraction. Toluene was selected as the
solvent due to its frequent usage industrially (Hable et al., 1991). The effects of extracting
temperature, volume ratios of solvent versus wastewater, acidity of wastewater and extraction
stages on the recovery percentage of organic compound were elucidated.
2. Experimental Methods
2.1. Extraction testing
The experiments were conducted in an autoclave system under atmospheric pressure from
303 K to 333 K (referred to Chen et al., 2005b). Prior to testing, a proportionate amount of
wastewater (100 ml) from dinitration or trinitration process (pH 7.0, rendered by military
ammunition plant) was situated in the autoclave (Autoclave Engineers, Erie PA 16512 Model).
The identical volume of toluene (99.5 %, Fluka) was supplied by a liquid metering pump (LDC
6prepared from a stock methanol solution with toluene concentration range of 0 ~ 200 mg/l.
2.5. Gas chromatograph/Mass spectrometer analysis (GC/MS)
The proportionate amount (0.4l) of wastewater was injected into a gas
chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Hewlett Packard 59864B/HP 5973 MASS) equipped with a
capillary column (Metal ULTRA ALLOY UA-5, 30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness 0.25m),
operated from 313 K to 573 K at a programming rate of 20 Kmin-1. The mass spectra obtained
were utilized to identify the components involved in both wastewater and extract as compared
with the authentic standard compounds of database (Wiley 275.L).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of extracting temperature
Based on the analysis of GC/MS, the components of organic compounds in wastewater from
toluene dinitration and trinitration processes have been identified as 2,4-DNT, 2,6-DNT, 2,3-DNT,
3,4-DNT and 2,4,6-TNT respectively (as listed in Table 1). In addition, according to the analyses
of TOC and GC/FID, the contents of total organic compounds in wastewater from these processes
mentioned were separately about 550 mg/l and 580 mg/l, wherein the detailed compositions were
summarized in Table 2. Figure 1 illustrates the recovery percentage of TOC from wastewater of
dinitration and trinitration process by toluene extraction at different extracting temperatures. It
clearly indicates that the amounts of organic compounds extracted exhibited increasing trend with
increasing temperature. This phenomenon may be interpreted with enhancing solubility of
organic compounds into aqueous phase with increasing temperature (Phelan and Barnett, 2001).
Nonetheless, the effect of enhancing solubility of organic compounds into toluene, resulted from
temperature increase, is more obvious (Taylor and Rinkenbach, 1923). That leads to more organic
compounds extracted by toluene at high temperature. In fact, a similar trend was also observed
for the treatment of wastewater from trinitration process. As compared the data at the same
temperature between dinitration and trinitration processes, the former seems better than the latter.
The plausible explanation is the solubility of 2,4,6-TNT in aqueous phase being higher than those
of 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT, as reported by Chen et al. (2005b). As far as toluene extract recycled
into toluene nitration process is concerned, operated between 318 K and 328 K, the extracting
temperature at 323 K seems more suitable to be chosen for subsequent experimental tests.

8preferred under economic consideration. Owing to the obvious increment of recovery of TOC in
the toluene/wastewater ratio of two, it was beneficially chosen for subsequent experiments. As
expected, the weight percentage of 2,6-DNT in TOC extracted from wastewater of dinitration
process got higher than that of 2,6-DNT in wastewater feedstock (see Table 3), corresponding to
the result as mentioned above. Moreover, the composition of organic compounds extracted in the
case of trinitration process was similar to those described in extracting temperature dependent
testing. Consequently, it supports our previous hypothesis as regards extractable priority of
nitrotoluenes in wastewater.

3.3. Effect of acidity of wastewater
For the purpose of enhancing recovery of nitrotoluenes from wastewater, the acidity of
wastewater was adjusted by addition of sulfuric acid solution. The recovery percentage of organic
compounds as a function of acidity of wastewater is demonstrated in Fig. 3. Apparently, the
extracting efficiency of organic compounds from wastewater at lower pH value in dinitration
process was superior to that at higher pH value. An analogous trend was also observed for
wastewater of trinitration process. That may be ascribed to the solubility of nitrotoluenes in
wastewater, which decreases as pH value of wastewater decreases (Lynch et al., 2001). Therefore,
one may deduce that the recovery of nitrotoluenes from wastewater would be significantly
enhanced by an acidifying procedure. As far as the concentration of sulfate ions in wastewater
