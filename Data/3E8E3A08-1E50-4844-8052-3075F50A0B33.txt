[15], tungsten coatings deposited by plasma spraying [16],
multiple-criteria problems of VLSI manufacturing process [17],
nickel chrome sputtered to A2O3 [18], etc.
In one of our works [19] a method different from the known
was proposed to grow nanosized ZnOs. In this method an α brass
plate was used as both substrate and zinc source; A film of nickel
was deposited on the α brass as catalyst for the growth of
nanosized ZnOs; and a mixture of O2 and CH4 gasses was used as
the growth atmosphere. In this work the preparation of nanosized
factors current density (factor A) and plating time (factor C) are
for electroplating of nickel film; Flow rate of N2 (factor G) is for
carrying water vapor; and water temperature (factor H) is for
producing water vapor with various vapor pressures.
In this work the area occupied by nanosized ZnOs on α brass
substrate was selected as an object of function for the Taguchi
method. These areas weremeasured by amethod consisting of the
following steps:(i) reproducing the contour of the region occupied
by nanosized ZnOs on graph paper from the camera picture of
samples, (ii) measuring the area inside the contour. The data of
areas occupied by nanosized ZnOs were then used for analyses in
the Taguchi method. The analyses consist of analysis of mean
(ANOM) and analysis of variance (ANOVA). From ANOM the
effect of each control factor at a given level on the area occupied
by ZnOs can be estimated and then the optimum levels of control
factors for the growth of nanosized ZnOs with better yield can be
obtained. The aim of ANOVA is to estimate how much the
variance in occupied area is due to control factor or experiment
error and to determine the contribution percentage of each control
factor. A verification experiment was finally performed to verify
the optimum growth parameters.
3. Results and discussion
W.L. Liu et al. / Surface & Coatings TZnOs using α brass was further studied by the Taguchi method to
find the optimum parameters for a better yield of nanosized ZnOs.
2. Experimental detail
For the growth of nanosized ZnOs, an α brass(70 wt.% Cu-
30 wt.% Zn) plate was used as a substrate in this work. Before
electroplating process for the deposition of nickel film, theα brass
plate was cleaned first in a dilute acid solution (5 vol.% H2SO4+
95 vol.% H2O) and then in an acetone with supersonic vibration.
The electroplating bath consists of nickel sulfate(48 g/l), boric
acid(6 g/l), and nickel chloride(9 g/l). Both dilute sulfuric acid and
sodium hydroxide were used for keeping the bath at the pH value
of 5. The temperature of bath was kept at 50 °C and the plating
bath was agitated by a magnetic stirrer with normal speed. The
current density was 3 and 6 A/dm2 and the plating time was 0.5,
1.0, and 1.5 min, respectively.
The synthesis of nanosized ZnOswas carried out in a horizontal
quartz tube in furnace. After α brass plates coated nickel film were
put into the central region of quartz tube, they were heated to a
preset temperature under an atmosphere of N2 with a flow rate of
120 sccm (standard cubic centimeter per minute) and then main-
tained at this temperature for a preset time under an atmosphere of
O2, CH4, H2O, and N2 with various flow rates.
The nanosized ZnOs obtained in this work were characterized
by electron microscopes. A scanning electron microscope (SEM)
(JEOLLtd, Jsm-T330A) operated at 20 kVwas used to observe the
morphologies. A JEOL-2010 EX transmission electron micro-
scope (TEM) operating at 200 kVwas used for the examination of
crystal structure and morphology. The chemical composition of
nanosized ZnOs was determined by an energy dispersive X-ray
spectroscope (EDS) equipped in the electron microscope.
In the Taguchi method for optimizing the growth of
nanosized ZnOs, eight factors were taken as variables for
controlling ZnO growth, which are current density (factor A),
growth temperature (factor B), plating time (factor C), growth

has two levels, the other factors have three levels to be varied for
study. These factors and their levels are shown in Table 1. An
orthogonal array of L18 (2
1 ×37) shown in Table 2 was selected
for study in the Taguchi method. It can be seen that there are in
total 18 experiments needed for this work. Among the control

9239echnology 201 (2007) 9238–9242Fig. 1(A) and (B) shows respectively the SEM picture and
EDS diagram for the sample of experiment no. 1. It can be seen
Fig. 3(A). The TEM diffraction pattern for this ZnO nanowire is
shown in Fig. 4(B) in which the spots diffracted from (0002),
(011¯2), and (011¯0) planes have been indexed. It clearly shows
the ZnO nanowire has single crystal structure.
As stated in the report [19], the Ni film deposited on the
surface of brass substrate can act as not only a catalyst for the
decomposition of CH4 into C and H,CH4Y
Ni CðsÞ þ 2H2, but also
a barrier against the Zn diffusion uniformly to the surface
of substrate. The C(s) may react with O2 and become CO2 or
CO. The possible reactions between gaseous species of CO,
CO2, CH4, O2, H2 and H2O in the growth tube at 600–800 °C
are CH4 þ 2O2 ¼ CO2 þ 2H2O;H2 þ 12 O2 ¼ H2O; and COþ
1
2 O2 ¼ CO2. Excepting from the reactions stated above, the
gaseous H2O is chiefly produced by the evaporation of water
and carried into growth tube by N2 gas with various flow rates.
The saturation pressure of water vapor at 25, 55, and 85 °C is
3.169, 15.758 and 57.83 kpa, respectively. In other words, the
volume ratio of gaseous H2O for 25:55:85 °C is about 1:5:18.
The growth of nanosized ZnOs is also much affected by the
Ni film coated on the α brass substrate. The thickness and grain
size of Ni film were controlled by the current density and
plating time in electrodeposition process. Within an scope for
appropriate current density, the grain size of Ni film decreases
with an increase in current density due to the larger nucleation
rate. Of course, the thickness of Ni film increases with the
increase in plating time. According to the reducing reaction in
9241W.L. Liu et al. / Surface & Coatings Technology 201 (2007) 9238–9242The verification experiment was performed using the
optimum condition listed in Table 4. The area occupied by
nanowired ZnOs in this experiment is 473.1 mm2, which is the
average of three samples and equals the whole area coated with
nickel film before ZnO growth. The SEM picture and EDS
diagram of ZnO grown in verification experiment were shown
in Fig. 3(A) and (B), respectively. The morphology of
nanowired ZnOs in Fig. 3(A) is very similar to that in Fig. 2(A).
The area occupied by nanosized ZnO was used as the
justification of yield of reaction in this work. If the weight is
chosen to study the yield, the measurement error may be
increased because the weight is about 1 mg for ZnO and 2.0 g
for substrate and moreover among ZnO nanowires there was
Ni film which may be scratched out and mixed in ZnO. From
Figs. 1(A) and 3(A), it can be shown that the number of ZnO
nanowires per unit area is very difficult to be obtained due to the
overlap and interweave between ZnO nanowires; Therefore, the
area occupied by ZnO was selected to justify the yield.
It can be shown from the EDS in Figs. 1(B) and 3(B) that
there has some carbon deposited on substrate. The peak for
Fig. 2. Response of signal–noise ratio, S/N, to each factor level.carbon stands at the next left of Oxygen in EDS. Although
carbon exists on substrate, its content is very small. Carbon
nanotubes can't be found from images of TEM and SEM.
Among the nanosized ZnO prepared in this work there has very
small amount of carbon of which form is film rather than tube.
