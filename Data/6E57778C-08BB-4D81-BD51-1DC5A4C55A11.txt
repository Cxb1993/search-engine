11. Introduction
During the past two decades, the influence of a permissible delay in payments on
the optimal inventory system has attracted attention from numerous researchers. Goyal
(1985) derived an EOQ model under conditions of permissible delay in payments.
Subsequently, some research articles related to Goyal (1985) such as Aggarwal and
Jaggi (1995) presented the economic ordering policies of deteriorating items in the
presence of permissible payment delay. Chu et al. (1998) investigated the economic
ordering policy of deteriorating items presented in the model of Aggarwal and Jaggi
(1995). Furthermore, Jamal et al. (1997) generalized the model of Aggarwal and Jaggi
(1995) to include consideration of shortages. Chen and Chung (1999) analyzed buyer
economic order model under situations involving trade credit. Furthermore, Shah (1993
a) designed a inventory model for an exponentially decaying inventory under a situation
of permissible payment delays. Finally, Hwang and Shinn (1997) designed a retailer
pricing and lot-sizing policy for exponentially deteriorating products under the condition
of permissible delay in payments. The other relevant papers related to the delay of
payments such as Arcelus and Srinivasan (1993), Shah (1993 b), Chung (1998), Chung
and Liao (2004, 2006), Daellenbach (1986), Haley and Higgins(1973), Jaggi and
Aggarwal (1994), Jammal et al. (2000), Kim et al. (1995), Sarker et al. (2001), Shinn
(1997), Shinn and Hwang (2003) and their references.
From an economic perspective, such credit policies can be applied as an alternative
to price discounts to induce larger orders. Hence, a key problem associated with
inventory maintenance is deciding where to stock the items. However, all the above
models were developed primarily for a single warehouse with unlimited capacity.
Additionally, thinking in more practical terms, any warehouse has limited capacity.
Hence, the models listed above are unsuitable for situation where it is necessary to hold
large stocks. An early discussion dealing with an inventory model with two storage
facilities is presented by Hartely (1976) who designed an inventory model involving two
3theorems. These results can help retailers decision in making decision regarding
whether or not to rent RW to hold more items to maximize annual profits.
2. Notations and Assumptions
The notations adopted in this paper are as below.
A the replenishment cost per order；
D the demand rate per unit time；
W the storage capacity of OW；
T the length of replenishment cycle；
Q the replenishment quantity per replenishment；
s the selling price per unit item；
c the purchasing cost per unit item；
0h the holding cost per unit per unit time in OW；
rh the holding cost per unit per unit time in RW and 0hhr  ；
 the deterioration rate in OW, where 10  ；
 the deterioration rate in RW, where 10  and  ；
wT the time at which the inventory level reaches zero in RW；
aT )1ln(

D
W

 ；
M credit period set by the supplier ( aTM  )；
pI capital opportunity cost (as a percentage)；
eI earned interest rate (as a percentage)；
)(T the annual net profit function；
The following assumptions are used in developing the model.
(1) Replenishment is instantaneous with a known, constant lead time.
(2) The time horizon of the inventory system is infinite.
(3) Shortages are not allowed to occur.
(4) The owned warehouse (OW) has a fixed capacity of W units.
5two-warehouse inventory system. Moreover, the two-warehouse inventory system can be
summarized as follows: At the beginning of each replenishment cycle, the system
receives Q units of which W units are kept in the OW, while the remainder are kept
in the RW. Besides, during the interval ),0( wT , the items in the RW are consumed first,
followed by those in the OW. Thinking in more practical terms, the deterioration
depends on preserving facilities and environmental conditions available in a warehouse,
different warehouses may have different deterioration rates. Accordingly, the inventory
in the RW depletes because of deterioration and demand over time wT until it reaches
level zero. Thus, the variation of )(tI R at time ),0( wTt is given by the following
differential equation：
DtI
dt
tdI
R
R  )()(  , wTt0 (1)
with boundary condition 0)( wR TI .
The solution of Eq. (1) is
 1)( )(  tTR weDtI  , wTt0 (2)
On the other hand, by this stage, a portion of the inventory in the OW is depleted
owing to deterioration and consumption begins in the OW at time wT . Thus, the
variation of )(0 tI at time ),0( wTt is determined by the following equation：
)(

tdI  , wTt0 (3)
with initial condition WI )0(0 . The solution to (3) is
teWtI )(0 , wTt 0 (4)
Finally, during ),( TTw , the inventory depletes as a result of the combination effect of
demand and deterioration until time T . This behavior can be represented using the
following differential equation：
DtI

tdI  )()(  , TtTw  (5)
with boundary condition 0)( TI . The solution of (5) is
7interest for the items in stock after time M with rate pI . Hence, the interest

Finally, for the sake of completeness, let us consider the following two cases：
(a) If 0hhr   , then 0)(3 Tf . That is, )(3 Tf decreases on ),0(  .
(b) If 0hhr   , then it is impossible to ensure that )(3 Tf is less below 0.
Combining (a) and (b) attention in the remainder of the mathematical analysis is
limited to the conditions of 0hhr   .
Let *3T denote the roots of 0)(3 Tf if *3T exist. Then, the following theorem is
obtained.
Theorem 1：
(1)If 0)(3 aTf , *3T is the unique solution such that )(3 T has the maximum on
),[ aT .
(2)If 0)(3 aTf , then )(3 T is decreasing on ),[ aT . So aTT *3 .
Proof：
(1)If Eq. (13) is rewritten, then
)(
1
)( 323 TfT
T  (16)
Since )(3 Tf is a strictly decreasing function of T. From  )(lim 3 TfT and
0)(3 aTf , the Intermediate Value Theorem (1996)[30] yields that 0)(3 Tf has a
unique solution *3T on ),[ aT . Hence
