英文摘要
Patterned carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles were fabricated using the thermal chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) method. The optimal growth conditions were annealing for 1 hr and C2H2
flowing at 750℃. Patterns of different diameters and distances were defined on Si(100) substrates
using photolithography. Bundle height was controlled using different hydrocarbon flow times.
The inter-bundle distance to bundle height ratio was maintained at 2, a number predicted to have
a maximum field emission for CNT, and left the patterned CNT bundle area as a variable
parameter. The relationship between this area and the electron field emission characteristics was
studied. The lowest threshold electric field of 0.7 V/m was obtained when the total area of
patterned CNT bundles was approximately 46%.

1. 前言及研究目的
The field emission display (FED) is one type of display product that is regarded as an
important next generation display product. The FED has low power consumption, high luminance,
low reaction time and high visual angle [1]. Many materials have been used for FEDs such as
diamond micro-tip arrays, Mo tips, Si tips, and carbon nanotubes (CNT). Since 1995, CNTs have
become a strong contender for FED. Reports show that CNT field emitters exhibit excellent field
emission properties regardless of morphology, single-walled or multi-walled, orientation and
method of synthesis.
In CNT emitter fabrication, the CNT length and the inter-tube distance are important
parameters. It has been predicted that the field emission becomes maximum when the inter-tube
distance to the height ratio for each individual CNT is approximately 2 [2, 3] as shown in Fig.
1(a). However, array fabrication with this ideal arrangement using isolated CNTs requires an
expensive nano-lithography technique. Alternatively, a pillar array of aligned CNT bundles
grown by CVD with photolithography was used to achieve an architecture that satisfies the
optimal inter-bundle distance to bundle height ratio. Individual CNTs were replaced by CNT
bundles with the pitch to bundle height ration maintained at 2, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Each CNT
bundle can be thought as a single emitter because of the screen effect [4, 5]. Since the CNT
bundle pillar array are used as field emitters, we doubt whether a patterned CNT bundle area will
3inter-bundle distance of 10 m and the diameter of 25 m. When the patterned CNT bundles of
total area was greater than 46% or smaller than 46%, the electron field emission property became
worse.
Threshold electric field of different inter-bundle distances with respect to patterned CNTs of
total area is showed in Figure 7. The patterned CNT bundles of total area are approximately 46%
which causes lowest threshold electric field. These data can be understood in terms of the model
discussed below. Although the electric field gradient is predominantly concentrated in CNTs at
the periphery of the bundle, the field emission at the center of the bundle is indispensable.
According to S. Fujii et al. reported, the ratio of the electric field gradient at the edge of the
bundle to the center of the bundle is approximately 3.5. That is to say, CNTs at the center of the
bundle contribute a great amount of field emission. It is understood that the smaller the patterned
CNT bundles of total area result in greater density of the patterned CNT bundles. This
consequently wastes more space in the inter-bundle distance. Although increasing the density of
the patterned CNT bundles can increase the number of CNTs on the periphery, the number of
CNTs at the center of the bundle will decrease. The influence of decreasing the number of CNTs
at the center of the bundle is greater than increasing the number of CNTs at the periphery when
the patterned CNT bundles of total area is smaller than a critical value. In this study, 46% is the
critical value. A schematic illustration of this model is shown in Fig. 8(a). CNTs contribute less
to field emission when the patterned CNT bundles of total area is smaller than 46%. The electron
field emission property becomes worse when the patterned CNT bundles of total area is smaller
than 46%.
The reason the electron field emission property become worse when the patterned CNT
bundles of total area is greater than 46% is discussed below. The greater the patterned CNT
bundles of total area result in less bundle density in the patterned CNT bundles. This
consequently wastes too much space on CNTs at the center of the bundle. Although increasing the
patterned CNT bundles of total area can increase the number field emission emitters, the CNTs at
the periphery of the bundle are more dominant. The influence of decreasing CNTs at the
periphery of the bundle is greater than that for increasing CNTs at the center of the bundle when
the patterned CNT bundles of total area is greater than 46%. The ratio of brilliant field emitters to
poor field emitters is too low to promote field emission property result in the electron field
emission property becoming worse when the patterned CNT bundles of total area is greater than
46%. A schematic illustration of this model is shown in Fig. 8(b).
This model discussed above explains why 46% of the patterned CNT bundles of total area
have the lowest threshold electric field.
4.結論
This study determined that the suitable growth conditions for CNTs are annealing for 1 hr
and C2H2 flowing 20 min at 750℃. Patterns of different diameter and inter-bundle distance were
synthesized on Si(100) substrates using photolithography. In this study, the individual CNTs
were replaced by CNT bundles, maintaining the inter-bundle distance to bundle height ratio at 2.
The inter-bundle distances were fixed at 5, 10, 25, and 50m and diameters varied from 5 to 100
