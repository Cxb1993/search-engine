Abstract:
Styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS) membrane was prepared by
solution casting method and then was epoxidized with peroxyformic acid generated in
situ to yield the epoxidized Styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer membrane
(ESBS). Infrared spectroscopy, Universal Testing Machine, differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) were conducted to
characterize the structure, mechanical and thermal properties of ESBS. In order to
evaluate if the ESBS membrane is suitable for the usage as wound dressing, the
measurement of contact angle, water absorption, protein adsorption, water vapor
transmission were determined. It is found that ESBS membrane has the same water
vapor transmission as human skin. From the study of cell adhesion, proliferation and
cell culture kinetics, it revealed that the cells not only remained viable but also
proliferated on the surface of the various ESBS membranes and the population
doubling time for fibroblast culture decreased. It means that the ESBS membrane can

Owing to the presence of phase separated structures, styrene-butadiene-styrene
block copolymer (SBS) and polyurethane (PU) possess very attractive bulk
mechanical properties. They behave as vulcanized rubbers at room temperature, and
yet can be processed as thermoplastics at elevated temperatures. As a result, they have
gained considerable attention in recent years. In our previous studies [5-17], the
modification of SBS and PU had been reported, and the eeffect of the modification of
bulk and surface properties on their performances for biomaterials has been studied.
Rapid and proper healing is important in the treatment of wounds. In cases of severe
and large amounts of skin loss, immediate coverage of the wound surface with a
dressing is needed. In general, the dressing material must be capable of absorbing the
exuded liquid from the wounded area. It should permit water evaporation at a certain
rate and allow no microbial transport. Chen et al. [18] reported a method for
preparation of temporary wound dressing materials by radiation grafting modification
on nonwoven fabric. An animal study of a tri-layer wound dressing material,
nonwoven fabric grafted with N-isopropylacrylamide and gelatin, was reported by Lin
et al. [19, 20]. In our previous study, a modified polypropylene nonwoven fabric with
γ-ray and UV photografting method for preparation of temporary wound dressing
materials [21]. A wound dressing of acrylic acid-grafted and γ-polyglutamic
acid/chitosan-immobilized polypropylene non-woven fabric was reported by Wang et
al. [22]. The basic matrix discussed in the above studies is composed by
polypropylene non-woven fabric, which provides an open structure for exudates
drainage out. As polypropylene non-woven fabric is a plastic material without
flexibility and rubbery properties, it is not ease to be used a dressing with immediate
coverage of the wound surface. In order to overcome this disadvantage,
styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer (SBS), which behaves as vulcanized

in deionized water for several hours. The SBS membranes were dried under vacuum.
Epoxidation of SBS membrane
A mixture of formic acid (99%) and hydrogen peroxide (35%) with mole ratio of
1.5 was prepared. The dried SBS membrane was immersed into the mixture solution
immediately. The reaction mixture was stirred for predetermined time. After
completion of the reaction, the epoxidized SBS membrane was washed with deionized
water followed by drying in a vacuum oven. The epoxidized SBS membranes with
different epoxidation time were characterized with a Perkin-Elmer model 567 infrared
spectrometer.
Measurement of tensile strength and thermogravimetric analysis of
epoxidized SBS membrane
Membranes with various epoxidation times were cut into pieces measuring 30
mm x 10 mm x 0.1 mm. The stress of epoxidized SBS membrane was determined
with the Universal Testing Machine (Schimadzu DCS-500). The thermal properties
were evaluated with DSC (TA/DSC2010). The DSC was scanned from -30 to 250 oC
at heating rate of 10 oC/min under N2 atmosphere. Thermogravimetry analysis, TGA,
was conducted using TA/TGA2050 system. It was measured from 25 to 700 oC at a
heating rate of 10 oC/min under N2 atmosphere.
Measurement of the contact angle and water content
A drop of distilled water was placed o the surface of the various epoxidized SBS
membrane using a pipette, and the contact angle between the water drop and
membrane was measured. A few more drops of water were added until the contact
angle was constant.
The various epoxidized SBS membrane was cut into 2 x 2 cm2 to determine its dry

lag phase is the time following subculture and reseeding during which there is little
evidence of an increase in the cell number. (2) The log phase is the period of
exponential increase in the cell number following the lag period and terminating in
one or two population doublings after confluency is reached. In the log phase, the
growth fraction is high (usually 90-100%), and the culture is in its most reproducible
form. (3) The plateau phase is toward the end of the log phase. The culture becomes
confluent and all of the cells are in contact with surrounding cells.
The construction of a growth curve from cell counts performed at intervals after
subculture enables the measurement of the parameters that should be found to be
characteristic of the cell under the given set of culture conditions. The first of these
parameters is the duration of the lag period, or lag time, obtained by extrapolating a
line drawn through the points for the exponential phase until it intersects the seeding
concentration and then reading off the elapsed time since seeding equivalent to that
intercept. The second parametner is the population doubling time (PDT)-i.e., the time
taken for the culture to increase twofold in the middle of the exponential, or log phase
of growth.
Experimental design of Cell adhesion and proliferation
The specimens were washed with 99% ethanol for three times. And then the samples
were immersed in 70 % aqueous ethanol for 24 h for sterilization and washed with
PBS at least three times to remove all residual alcohol. 3T3 fibroblast cells were
seeded onto the various epoxidized SBS membranes and incubated at 37 oC with 5 %
CO2. Attached cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde. The well dishes were stained with
Haematoxylin and Eosin for polulation observation with an optical microscope.
To evaluate the proflieration of 3T3 on the specimens, the number of cells was

group increased. The epoxidation of unsaturated compounds by peracids depends on
the source of the peracid, its chemical nature, and the presence of a catalyst. The
presence of an acid as a catalyst may lead to side reactions such as hydroxylation or
ester formation [12, 26]. In Fig. 1, it is also found that the absorption peak at about
1700-1740 cm-1 for the C=O group increased with epoxidation time. So the side
reaction of epoxidation in this work also took place.
The tensile strength and elongation for pure SBS is about 4600 psi and 880%.
After epoxidation, the tensil strength increased but the elongation decreased.
Compared with the pure SBS, the tensile strength and elongation for ESBS60,
ESBS90, and ESBS120 are about (0.2MPa, 648%), (0.46MPa, 863%) and (0.68MPa,
626%), respectively. DSC curves of the various epoxidized SBS membrane were
shown in Fig. 2. Not any exothermic peak was presented for pure SBS and ESBS30,
whereas there is an exothermic peak for ESBS60, ESBS90, and ESBS120,
respectively. It is also found that the temperature for the exothermic peak shifted to
the lower temperature for the membrane epoxidezed with longer epoxidation time.
Whereas the values for the exothermic peak increased for the membrane treated with
longer epoxidation time. Compared to the pure SBS membrane, the temperature and
the value for the exothermic peaks of ESB60, ESBS90, and ESBS120 are (161 oC,
78J/g), (156 oC, 140J/g), and (154 oC, 144J/g), respectively.
The representative TGA curves for the pure SBS membrane were shown in Fig. 3a.
Two stages of thermal degradation were found. The temperature ranges for the
degradation at the first and second stages are about 360-460 and 490-530 oC,
respectively. After epoxidation, the temperature of thermal degradation for the first
stage shifted to low temperature for the various epoxidized SBS membrane. Whereas
the opposite result for the second stage were found. With increasing the epoxidation

epoxidation time. (5) The epoxidation of SBS altered the microstructure and
conformation that resulted in the property changes of SBS membranes. As the increase
of the tensile strength and the decrease of the elongation for the epoxidized SBS
membrane, the molecular weight between crosslinking points (Mc) decreased. It
means that there is more strong interaction between the polymer chain and the more
energy is necessary for the movement of polymer chain in the epoxidized SBS
membrane. Where the Mc could be determined by the following equation [26, 30]:
Mc = ρRT (α-α-2)/δ
Where ρ is the density of the specimen, T the absolute temperature, δ the tensile
stress, andα = Lf / L0 where L0 and Lf are the length of the specimen before and after
stress is applied. (6) As the second stage is due to the breakdown of the
polystyrene-rich copolymer of the expoidized SBS, the more energy is necessary for
the epoxidized SBS membrane with higher tensile strength and lower elongation and
resulted in the increasing of thermal stability for the epoxidized SBS membrane.
Effect of epoxidation time on the performance of the epoxidized SBS membrane
The variation of the water absorption with soaking time for the various epoxidized
SBS membranes is shown in Fig. 5. The water content increased with the soaking time
initially and then leveled off. The water absorption in the epoxidized SBS also
increased with increasing the epoxidation time for the membrane. Table 2 shows the
effect of epoxidation time on the contact angle and water content on epoxidized SBS
membrane. With increasing epoxidation time, the contact angle on the membranes
decreased whereas the water content increased. It means that the membrane after
modification with epoxidation, the material becomes more hydrophilic by comparing

about (7.1μg/cm2, 7.3μg/cm2 ) (8.0μg/cm2, 11.5μg/cm2) and (10.2μg/cm2, 11.9μg/cm2),
respectively. It seems that the adsorption of protein in the membrane increased with
higher epoxidation time on the SBS membrane. It is due to the existence of the oxygen
containg groups in the epoxidized SBS membrane. As protein with amino acid
functional group, it is ease to interaction with the oxygen atom of the epoxidized SBS
by dipole moment or hydrogen bonding. With longer epoxidation time, higher oxygen
containing groups were found in the epoxidized SBS membrane, so the adsorption of
fibrinogen on the epoxidized SBS increased compared to pure SBS membrane.
Study of culture cell kinetics
Adhesion of cells to the surface of various ESBS membranes was examined under
light microscopy. Figures 6 show the microscopic observations of 3T3 fibroblast cells
that had adhered to various ESBS membrane after 12 h of seeding. The optical
microscopy in Fig. 6 reveals that various ESBS membranes would not harm the
growth of the 3T3 fibroblast cells. The morphology of the 3T3 still retains its
phenotype.
In order to study the culture cells kinetics of fibrobast on the various ESBS membrane,
the plot of lnN against cell culture time (t) is displayed in Figure 6. A straight line was
obtained, showing that the culture of fibroblast on various ESBS is in exponential
phase for the time interval between 6 and 42 h and can be described by Equation 2.
The rate constants and apparent cell number can be determined from the slopes and
intercepts. The results of the positive slopes of the cell growth curves in Figure 7
revealed that the cells not only remained viable but also proliferated on the surface of
the various ESBS membranes, although the rate constant for various ESBS
membranes are lower than that of control material (tissue culture polystyrene) (Table
3). The initial cell number seeded on the various ESBS and control material is the

human skin, ESBS90 and ESBS120 membrane is 215, 350, 230 and 310 g/day‧m2,
respectively. It is found that both of ESBS90 and ESBS120 have the same water vapor
transmission as human skin. From the study of cell adhesion and proliferation, it
revealed that the cells not only remained viable but also proliferated on the surface of
the various ESBS membranes and the population doubling time for fibroblast culture
decreased from 37.9 h to 29.3 h by compared ESBS120 to pure SBS membrane. It
seems that both of the ESBS90 and ESBS120 membranes are suitable for the
application as a wound dressing materials.
