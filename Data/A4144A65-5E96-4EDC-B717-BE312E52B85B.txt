The characterizations on the microstructural and 
mechanical properties of the Mg-Al-Zn multi-element 
intermetallic alloys fabricated by friction stir 
processing (FSP) are presented. The composites of the 
alloys vary within Mg35-70Al5-25Zn25-45. The maximum 
working temperature can reach 550oC. The current 
process applies the FSP on vertically stacked foils of 
various portions of Mg, Al and Zn, 99.9% in purity and 
0.2 to 1 mm in thickness. In order to homogenize the 
alloy composition, three or more FSP passes in 
opposite directions are applied. Depending on the 
relative contents of Mg, Al and Zn, numerous 
intermetallic compound phases are induced. The 
resulting intermetallic alloys exhibit high hardness up 
to 350 Hv.

Introduction 
The friction stir welding technique [1], and the later 
modified friction stir processing (FSP) [2,3] have 
attracted considerable attention lately. FSP has been 
demonstrated to be an effective means of refining the 
grain size of cast or wrought aluminum or magnesium 
based alloys via dynamic recrystallization [4-8]. Also, 
the severe plastic deformation and material flow in the 
stirred zone can be utilized to achieve surface or bulk 
alloy modification via mixing of other elements or 
second phases into the stirred alloys. The stirred 
materials can result in metal matrix composites [9-11] 
or intermetallic alloys [12] with much higher hardness 
and wear resistance. 
Commercial cast or wrought type Mg-Al-Zn 
AZ-series alloys, such as AZ91, AZ61 or AZ31 with 
3-9 wt%Al and 1 wt% Zn, have been widely used in 
automobiles or electronic appliances. The hardness of 
such AZ-series alloys is typically in the range of 
50-100 in Hv scale, and they suffer from insufficient 
wear and creep resistance. Many academic and 
industrial research teams have made great efforts to 
improve the strength, hardness and creep properties of 
the commercial magnesium alloys by adding Y or rare 
earth elements, as well as micro- or nano-sized ceramic 
reinforcements. In the current study, an alternative 
approach is used by mixing a much higher portion 
(10-30 wt%) of the existing solute elements Al and Zn 
through FSP. Through the induced intermetallic phases 
during rigorous FSP deformation, the resulting 
materials will exhibit much more promising thermal 
and mechanical properties.  
 
Experimental methods 
The base Mg was AZ31 Mg alloy, purchased from 
the CDN Company, Delta, BC, Canada, with the 
chemical composition of Mg-3.02 wt%Al-1.01 wt%Zn. 
The as-received AZ31 was fabricated through 
semi-continuous casting, with the form of an extruded 
billet measuring 178 mm in diameter and 300 mm in 
length. The AZ31 billet was then hot extruded to 1 mm 
in thickness and 120 mm in width. Pure Al and pure Zn 
foils of 99.9% purity and 0.2 and 0.125 mm in 
thickness, respectively were adopted for mixing with 
the AZ31 sheets. The alloys ratio was reached by 
stacking Mg sheets and Al, and Zn foils in the stirring 
position. The detailed stacking sequence is shown in 
Fig. 1. The alloy compositions tried in this study varied 
within the range of Mg37.5-80Al5-25Zn10-45. 
The simplified FSP machine was a modified form 
of a horizontal-type miller, with a 5 HP capability. The 
fixed pin tool was 6 mm in diameter and 5 mm in 
length, with a pitch distance of 1.2 mm. The shoulder 
diameter was 16 mm, and the tilt angle of the fixed pin 
tool was 2o. The pin rotation was set to be 1500 rpm, 
and the pin advancing speed was 20 mm/min. Most 
FSP experiments were conducted with air cooling, 
selected FSP runs were performed using copper 
clamping kits with water or liquid N2 cooling system. 
For comparison, the Mg70Al5Zn25 alloy system was 
also prepared by rapid quenching melt spinning with a 
cooling rate around 105 K/s. All of the processed 
specimens were examined by optical, scanning or 
transmission electron microscopy (OM, SEM, or TEM), 
and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 
Vicker’s microhardness (Hv) measurements.

For comparison, the Mg70Al5Zn25 alloy system 
was also prepared by rapid quenching melt spinning 
with a cooling rate around 105 K/s. The typical 
SEM/BEI micrograph is shown in Fig. 7. There is no 
apparent large intermetallic particle seen in the matrix. 
The whole specimen contains a homogenous and 
amorphous phase. 
 
X-ray diffraction. The XRD patterns of the 
Mg70Al5Zn25 system fabricated by FSP and melt 
spinning are compared in Fig. 8. There is no detectable 
crystalline peak for the melt spun amorphous specimen, 
but many crystalline peaks for the FSP counterpart. 
The typical XRD patterns of the Mg70Al5Zn25, 
Mg50Al5Zn45 and Mg37.5Al25Zn37.5 alloys fabricated by 
FSP such are shown in Fig. 9. When the Al and Zn 
contents were low, the XRD patterns of the 
Mg80Al10Zn10 system resembled those of the FSP AZ31 
alloys. With much more Al and Zn in Mg70Al5Zn25, 
Mg50Al5Zn45 and Mg37.5Al25Zn37.5, the XRD patterns in 
Fig. 9 are replaced by multiple phases, including the 
intermediate phases of Mg3Al2Zn3 (in the form of 
either cubic or icosahedral crystal structure) Mg2AlZn 
and Mg4AlZn11, and possibly some others. The 
diffraction peaks gradually declined and broadened 
with increasing FSP passes, suggesting the overall 
refinement of the microstructure. The peak broadening 
becomes more apparent in Mg50Al5Zn25 or 
Mg37.5Al25Zn37.5, as shown in Fig. 9. It appears that the 
increasing FSP passes and higher Al and Zn contents 
are promising means of refining grains to submicron- 
or nano-scales.

Hardness measurement. The typical hardness 
measurement results along the transverse 
cross-sectional plane are depicted in Fig. 10. The 
average Hv values in the various alloy systems and 
processes are also compared in Table 1. The hardness 
is seen to gradually increase with increasing Al and Zn 
contents (Fig. 10). The average hardness value 
approaches 350 Hv in the Mg50Al5Zn45 and 
Mg37.5Al25Zn37.5 systems after 3 passes without cooling 
system. However, the variation of hardness values with 
higher Al and Zn contents also slightly increases. 
Increasing the FSP passes would reduce the variation 
of Hv readings inside the nugget zone and the 
microstructure becomes more uniform. The hardness 
value of Mg37.5Al25Zn37.5 after 10 passes shows 
minimum variation. This is due to the highly uniform 
microstructure in this system which can be seen in the 
Fig. 6. The hardness value of Mg70Al5Zn25 fabricated 
by melt spinning could approach 264 Hv, but the 
hardness value of the same alloy system fabricated by 
FSP is only 164 Hv. The difference in hardness comes 
original from the different phase structure. It is obvious 
that a higher cooling rate is still necessary to generate 
fully or partially amorphous phase in the Mg-Al-Zn 
system.

(2) Solute and dispersoid combined 
effects on tensile ductility of 
nanostructured Al alloy produced  
by friction stir processing

Huang, and P.W. Kao  
 
Friction stir processing, as an effective route 
simultaneously to achieve high strength and high 
uniform ductility, was applied in this study. The current 
approach results in an ultrafine-grained Al based 
composite with highly dispersed nano-scaled alumina 
and uniformly distributed GP zones. Such a 
combination enables effective dislocation pinning and 
accumulation and leads to simultaneous increase in 
strength, work-hardening ability and ductility during 
tensile testing. 
 
Keywords: Al alloy; Ultrafine grain; Work hardening; 
Tensile elongation 
 
Even though the strength of bulk 
ultrafine-grained (ufg) materials produced by severe 
plastic deformation (SPD) is very high, their ductility 
at ambient temperature is deficient with elongation to 
failure typically just a few percent and uniform 
deformation range even smaller. The tensile 
engineering stress-strain curve peaks at a small plastic 
strain and then drop precipitously as strain localization 
induced failure occurs [1-2]. This low ductility is 
attributed to insufficient strain hardening due to an 
inability to accumulate dislocation; the latter can help 
delay localized deformation (necking) under tensile 
loading [2-4]. Different strategies have been developed 
to enhance both the uniform and total elongation 
without sacrificing strength [5-10]. One of the 
strategies to improve the ductility of ufg and 
nanostructured metals is based on the idea of adding 
very small second-phase particles which are 
homogeneously dispersed in the matrix [9-12]. The 
second phase increases the work hardening rate by the 
generation of strain gradient near particles owing to the 
generation of Orowan loops, thus enhancing its 
uniform elongation. Unfortunately, adding a greater 
amount of the strengthening phase would result in 
excessively strong work hardening rate and strength 
and disappointing low ductility.  
A new strategy, adding dissolved Zn (up to 15 
wt%) into the Al matrix, was proposed very recently 
[13], based on the formation of fine slip bands within 
Al-Zn ufg alloys and the uniform spreading of the fine 
slip bands all over the gauge length, resulting in a 
significantly enhanced total elongation. On the other 
hand, Kostorz [14] found strong evidence that in an 
Al-4.5at%Zn alloy the Guinier-Preston (GP) zones are 
formed uniformly during the aging at room 
temperature. However, during further deformation, 
dislocations will cut through the coherent GP zones 
and slightly hinder themselves in their motion, 
resulting in limited work hardening rate and the 
formation of slip bands. Hence, the uniform elongation 
of Kostorz’s Al-Zn ufg (with a grain size smaller than 
0.5 μm) alloys was not improved significantly in his 
work. Based on previous studies, friction stir 
processing (FSP) has been demonstrated to be an 
effective grain refinement route in fabricating bulk 
ultrafine grained metallic alloys or composites with 
different percentages of strengthening phases [15-19]. 
Along this line, an effective strategy is developed in 
this study, in an attempt to increase simultaneously the 
strength, uniform elongation and total elongation of the 
Al-Zn-Al2O3 composites by preparing the materials 
with (i) ultrafine-grained grain structures, (ii) 
uniformly distributed intrinsically precipitated GP 
zones, and (iii) uniformly dispersed extrinsically 
incorporated nano-scaled alumina particles. The 
mechanical properties of such ufg Al-Zn-Al2O3 
composites are evaluated in this paper. 
The starting materials used were commercial pure 
Al powders (99.7% purity, 325 mesh), alumina 
powders (99.9% purity, ~30 nm) and Zn powders 
(99.5% purity, 325 mesh). The materials are termed in 
accordance with the Zn and alumina particle contents: 
the pure Al is named as Z0 (with 0 wt%Zn), Al-5Zn 
and Al-15Zn are termed as Z5 and Z15 [13]. The 
Al-15wt%Al2O3-particle is named as Z0P15, and the 
Al-5Zn-15wt%particle and Al-15Zn-15wt%particle 
termed as Z5P15 and Z15P15, respectively. The 
premixed alloy powders were cold compacted into 
12×20×80 mm billets in a steel die set, under a 
pressure of 225 MPa. First, large pin (the diameters of 
the shoulder and probe of the tool were 16 and 6 mm, 
respectively) and high spindle rotation speed (1500 
rpm) were employed to produce dense and large 
cross-section bulk material. Then, after the sample and 
fixture cooled down to room temperature, the smaller 
diameter of the shoulder (6 mm) and probe of the tool 
(3 mm) and lower spindle rotation speed (500 rpm) 
were used to produce refined grain sizes. The tilt angle 
was maintained at approximately 3o.  
The tensile specimen was machined from the FSP 
billet with the tensile axis perpendicular to the FSP 
traveling direction. The dog-bone shaped tensile 
specimens were cut from the stir zone, measuring 8 
mm for gauge length, 2 mm for gauge width and 1.5 
mm in thickness. The tensile tests were conducted 
using an Instron 5582 universal testing machine with 
initial strain rates of 1×10-3 s-1 at room temperature. 
The specimens for regular and high-resolution 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM and HRTEM) 
 8
combination of alumina particles and GP zones also 
resists dislocation slip, which will increase the 
strength.  
In summary, by introducing extrinsic alumina 
dispersoids and intrinsic GP zones simultaneously into 
the ufg Al alloy matrix by FSP, we are able to increase 
the work hardening the ufg Al matrix by more than 5 
times, and then in-turn to strengthen the ufg pure Al by 
68%, along with the simultaneous improvement of 
uniform tensile elongation by more than 10 times. 
Effective dislocation pinning and accumulation leads to 
simultaneous increase in strength, work-hardening 
ability, and ductility during tensile testing. This 
strategy may be applied to many ufg material systems 
that utilize nano-scaled second-phase or precipitates as 
their strengthening mechanisms.

ultrafine-grained (ufg) metal and alloys synthesized in 
different ways (grain size d ≤ 500 nm) have been 
extensively investigated [6-8]. There is indirect 
evidence suggesting that grain boundary sliding may 
occur more easily in metals at room temperature in nc 
and ufg metal and this may give high strength and a 
reasonable level of tensile ductility [9-10]. The 
occurrence of grain boundary sliding in nanocrystalline 
solids at low temperatures has been predicted using 3D 
molecular-dynamic computer simulations to model the 
flow behavior [2-3]. In contrast to the superplastic and 
creep deformation at elevated temperatures, the grain 
boundary sliding occurred in nc and ufg metal and 
alloys at room temperature, showing that the ratio of 
the strain due to grain boundary sliding to the total 
strain, δ, was not inhomogeneous plastic deformation 
over the gauge length. Therefore, all determinations of 
δ obtained by the classic equation to estimate the 
contribution of grain boundary sliding were not 
feasible. To date, there has been only one published 
report on localized measurements of grain boundary 
sliding contributions at room temperature [9-11]. The 
results from these experiments on nc and ufg materials 
suggest there is a significant contribution from grain 
boundary sliding during deformation at room 
temperature. Chinh et al. [11] studied the contribution 
from grain boundary sliding during indentation testing 
at room temperature, with this contribution lying 
within the range of ~40-70%, using depth-sensing 
indentation testing and atomic force microscopy. 
However, the scatter in these estimated values is 
necessarily large and it is important to consider 
whether these surface observations are truly 
representative of the behavior within the bulk. Thus, it 
is not clear whether the values reported for effective 
contribution of sliding to the total strain, δ, reflect the 
realistic contribution of GBS. Definitely, it is desirable 
to obtain more quantitative information on the 
occurrence of grain boundary sliding during 
deformation at room temperature. In order to obtain 
proper samples and then estimate the contribution from 
grain boundary sliding to true-strain, especially 
post-uniform elongation range during uniaxial tensile 
tests, Al-Zn proves to be a good candidate because zinc 
is added to the nanostructured Al matrix primarily to 
improve a very low work-hardening rate, and also to 
increase total elongation, especially to post-uniform 
elongation [12]. 
  The purpose of this study is to apply a direct and 
precise method using focused ion beams (FIB), which 
makes possible scratch marker lines with appropriate 
length, depth, and width on the polished surface, to 
determine the contribution of GBS on the localized 
deformation, and to quantitatively evaluate the effect of 
Zn content dissolved into Al matrix on the contribution 
of GBS on localized deformation strain compared to 
the total strain. This is obtained with a grain size of 
~500 nm.  
The starting materials used were commercial 
pure Al powders (99.7% purity, 325 mesh) and Zn 
powders (99.5% purity, 325 mesh). The premixed alloy 
powders, with Zn content of 15 wt%, were cold 
compacted into 12×20×80 mm billets in a steel die set, 
under a pressure of 225 MPa. First, large pin (the 
diameters of the shoulder and probe of the tool were 16 
and 6 mm, respectively) and high spindle rotation 
speed (1500 rpm) were employed to produce dense 
large cross section bulk material. Then, the smaller 
diameters of the shoulder and probe of the tool and 
lower spindle rotation speed were used to produce 
refined grain size. Importantly, the processed samples 
and fixture have to be cooled down to room 
temperature when one processing operation parameter 
is changed to another. The tilt angle was maintained at 
approximately 3o. The detailed description of the FSP 
set-up can be found in some published papers [12-13]. 
The tensile specimen was machined from the FSP billet 
with the tensile axis perpendicular to the FSP traveling 
direction. Multiple dog-bone shaped tensile specimens 
with a 6 mm gauge length, a 1.5 mm width, and 1.5 
mm thickness were electro-discharge machined from 
the stir zone. The dog-bone samples were first surface 
polished to a mirror finish using silicon oxide of 20 nm 
particles, and then the specimens were processed using 
an ion polisher so as to remove the surface defects, 
such as scratches, embedded polishing grit, and oxide 
layers. Following polishing and removal of the surface 
defects, specimens were prepared for a scribe marker 
line using FIB. The width and depth of the scribed fine 
line were 50 nm and 60 nm, respectively, much finer 
than the mechanical scratches in previous publications. 
The fine FIB written patterns contain marker lines for 
observation of the evolution of GBS and accurate 
positioning for measuring the localized true strain, 
shown in Fig. 1. Determining the true strain in uniform 
and non-uniform fields can be easily calculated using 
the displacement between two cross markers scribed by 
FIB. Because of the examination of Portnoy’s 
experimental evidence [14], leading to the conclusion 
that longitudinal offsets of transverse scratches are 
larger than transverse offsets of longitudinal scratches 
and so the error of δ determination is smaller, all 
determinations of δ in this study relied on taking 
measurements of the w component of sliding and 
calculating gbsε from a relationship between Eqns. (2) 
and (3). The tensile tests were conducted using an 
Instron 5582 universal testing machine with initial 
strain rates of 1×10-3 s-1 at room temperature. The 
offsets or rotations of the marker lines were recorded 
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). More than 
200 measurements for each testing condition were 
made on SEM images to obtain a representative value. 
In this experiment, the Al-15Zn samples were 
processed at the specific operation parameters. Fig. 2(a) 
shows the SEM micrographs of samples Al-15Zn, 
revealing a well-defined equiaxed grain nature. In 
parallel, Fig. 2(b) shows the SEM micrographs of 
Al-15Zn with the grain size distribution. The samples 
show a monotonic grain size distribution with an 
average grain size of 480 nm. Friction stir processing 
(FSP) led to the dynamic recrystallization in all 
conditions as high-angle grain boundaries were 
distributed more than 85% in fraction, with equiaxed 
grains [15]. Since high-angled boundaries and fine 
grain are necessary in order to achieve GBS, this leads

NTU, NCU, NCKU, and ISU (left) and my PhD student (right).

 4
metallic materials, including cast Al alloys, Cu-Al bronze alloys, Fe base alloys, and NiAl 
alloys. Both single and multiple pass FSW/FSP in various passing routes are investigated. 
The results show satisfactory achievements.  
 
 In the Intermetallics session, there are a few nice talks give by Germany, Japanese, and 
Chinese scholars. The majority of papers are focused on NiAl and TiAl, not much from the 
emphasis in 1990s. The microstructures seem to be the main issue that people are mostly 
concerned.  
 
 In the poster sessions, there are non-student poster session and only student session. I 
feel that the second one student poster session was a great success. The graduate students all 
showed up in front of the poster and tried their best to explain their work. It is a good chance 
and good experience for them to feel the scientific discussion with foreign scholars. My 
student Welson Sung was also enthusiastic about this event, and I noticed that many German 
professors were interested with his work on GaN micro-pillars. He had no fear in facing those 
foreign researchers.
