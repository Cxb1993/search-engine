Project A 
Dissolution of cellulose in a RTIL 
 
Abstract 
Experimentally, about 4.5 and 8.0% of microcrystalline cellulose can be dissolved in the RTIL 
(room temperature ionic liquid ([C4mim]Cl, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride)) at 323 and 
383 K, respectively.  The estimated activation energy for the dissolution is 264 kJ/mol.  The 
dissolved cellulose forms a well dispersed material that can be separated efficiently from the 
RTIL at 298 K.  The dissolved cellulose has a reduced amount of the intra-molecular hydrogen 
bonding that may account for the effective dissolution of the difficult-to-treat cellulose in the 
RTIL.

Introduction  
Cellulose being a very abundant natural organic substance is generally used in paper, 
membrane, cosmetic, fiber, and polymer manufacturing [Heinze and Liebert, 2001; Edgar et al., 
2001; Fischer et al., 2002; Youngs et al., 2007].  The unit structures of cellulose are crystalline 
D–anhydroglucopyranose joined by β-1,4 glycosidic bonds [Lynd et al., 1999, 2002; Mansfield et 
al., 1999].  Due to strong hydrogen bonding in glucose, cellulose has an extreme low solubility 
in H2O or common organic solvents.  A few solvents such as LiCl/N,N-dimethylacetamide 
(DMAc), LiCl/1,3- dimethyl-2- imidazolidinone (DMI), LiCl/N-methyl-2-pyrolidine (NMP), 
LiClO4
.3H2O and LiSCN
.2H2O have been used in dissolution of cellulose [Terbojevich et al., 
1985; Dawsey and McDormick, 1990; Nishino and Matsuda, 1988; Nishino et al., 1988; Edgar et 
al., 1995; Fischer et al., 1999; Saalwachter and Burchard, 2001].  N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide 
(NMMO)/H2O has also been used in dissolution of cellulose from plants [Heinze and Liebert, 
2001].  However, those solvents turn out to be economically unattractive mainly because of the 
high volatility, toxicity, and operating temperatures. 
Generally, volatile organic solvents can be replaced with room temperature ionic liquids 
(RTILs).  Thus RTILs are also called “green solvents” [Earle and Seddon, 2000; Wilkes, 2002].  
Due to unique properties such as high ionic conductivity and thermal stability, low-volatility, and 
non-flammability, RTILs can be used in electrochemistry, separation, and catalysis [Dai wt al., 
1999; Welton, 1999; Huang et al., 2001; Rogers and Seddon KR, 2002; Huang and Sun, 2004].  
Cellulose and carbohydrates can be dissolved in RTILs such as 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium 
chloride, 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride, 3-methyl-N-butylpyridinium chloride, 
1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, and 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide 
[Swatloski et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2004; Heinze et al., 2005; Dorn et al., 2006; Young et al., 2007].

Conclusions 
Cellulose can be partially (4.5-8.0%) dissolved in the RTIL at 323-383 K.  The estimated 
activation energy for the dissolution is 264 kJ/mol.  The dissolved cellulose forms a well 
dispersed material that can be separated efficiently from the RTIL at 298 K.  The dissolved 
cellulose has a reduced amount of the intra-molecular hydrogen bonding that may account for the 
effective dissolution of the difficult-to-treat cellulose in the RTIL.

Synthesis of biporous molecular sieves 
 
Abstract 
ZSM-5/MCM-41 composite BPMS can be synthesized by using a dual template method 
through a process of a two-step crystallization, which hydrothermal synthesized at 373 K (pH = 
11) for 12 h and consequently hydrothermal synthesized at 413 K (pH = 9) for 12-24 h.  The 
synthesized biporous molecular sieves have characteristics of both MCM-41 and ZSM-5 in the 
XRD, FT-IR spectrums, and nitrogen adsorption isotherm. 
(Keywords: ZSM-5, MCM-41, biporous molecular sieves) 
 
Introduction 
Zeolites being porous materials are crystalline microporous aluminosilicate consisted of SiO4 
and AlO4 tetrahedras.  Zeolites generally have uniform micropores (<1 nm), high surface area, 
high hydrothermal stability, and desired shape selectivity.  Note that zeolites possessing super 
acidic sites and strong electric fields in the channels make them an effective catalyst or 
adsorbents (Corma, 1995). 
The unique shape selectivity of zeolites in product, reactant, and transition states can direct a 
reaction toward the desired products or reaction paths.  The shape-selective catalysis of zeolites 
was first discovered and reported by Weisz and Frilette (Weisz and Frilette, 1960) in the early 
1960s.  Natures of zeolites are strongly affected by the Si/Al ratio and pore structure.  High 
siliceous zeolites frequently have high acidities which can be very effective in catalytic cracking 
(Corma and Garcia, 2002). 
Zeolites can be synthesized in the presence of templating materials tetrapropylammonium 
bromide (TPABr).  Zeolite ZSM-5 (Zeolite Socony-Mobil-5) can be synthesized at Si/Al ratios 
of >20.  Without alumina, ZSM-5 may be formed.  The framework of ZSM-5 is composed of 
five-member rings to construct three dimensions interpenetrated channel system with 10-member 
rings.  ZSM-5 has three-dimensional, straight and interpenetrating channels with elliptical 
cross-sections of 5.7-5.8 Å by 5.1-5.2 Å. 
The major drawback of zeolites is that the small pore size which causes the diffusion 
limitations and insufficient reactions for large molecules.  Aims of reduction of zeolite particle 
sizes are to decrease the diffusion path length of the guest molecules.  Nevertheless, zeolites 
with small particle sizes may decrease the pore volume and reduce the stability of zeolites due to 
the unfavorable crystallization.  Smaller particles, furthermore, made the usage of zeolites are 
difficult since filtration and collection are not easy. 
Nevertheless, large molecules are not accessible because of pore size limitations.  In 1992,

The ZSM-5/MCM-41 composite molecular sieve was synthesized with sodium silica 
(MERCK, 8% Na2O/27%SiO2), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMABr) (ACROS), 
tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr) (ACROS), and water.  Sodium silica was used as silica 
source and CTMABr and TPABr were used as a template and a mineralizer, respectively in 
synthesis of BPMS.  16 g of sodium silica was added into the TPABr solution (3.55 g of TPABr 
were dissolved in 20 g of distilled water) and stirred vigorously for 1 h.  44 g of the CTMABr 
solution (4 g of CTMABr were dissolved into 40 g distilled water) was added into the mixture 
and stirring for 1 h.  50% acetic acid solution was used to adjust the pH value of the mixture to 
11.  The mixture gel was heated at 373 K in a teflon-lined autoclave for 12h to form the 
mesoporous structure.  Consequently, the pH value of the mixture was adjusted to 9 and heated 
at 413-428 K for 12-24 h to form ZSM-5.  The as-synthesized BPMS materials were filtered, 
washed with distilled water, dried at 373 K for 12 h, and calcined at 823 K for 6 h. 
The chemical structures of the catalysts were determined by X-ray powder diffraction with 
Cu Kα radiation.  Molecular sieves and catalysts were scanned from 1 to 50o (2θ).  The scan 
rate was 0.05o/sec with slits of 0.6, 0.6 and 0.05 μm.  The specific peak intensities and 2θ values 
were recorded and identified.  The structure and crystallinity of catalysts can be determined by 
comparing the intensity with standard compound. 
The specific surface areas of the catalysts were analyzed by the BET models.  Samples were 
degassed at 573 K for 3 hours before N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were conducted at 77 K. 
 
Results and Discussion 
MCM-41 has attracted much attention in scientific and commercial developments because of 
its uniform mesopore, high surface area, and tunable pore diameters.  Although mesoporous 
materials may be a solution for thermal cracking of larger molecules, they are insufficient for the 
need of thermal and hydrothermal stability.  Many efforts have been done to combine 
microporous and mesoporous in one molecular sieve to have the advantages of both.  These 
composite materials have biporous systems and combine the benefits of each pore size regine 
which may potentially improve the efficiency of catalysis. 
ZSM-5/MCM-41 composites can be synthesized by using the dual template method through a 
process of a two-step crystallization.  TPABr (tetrapropyl ammonium bromide) and CTABr 
(hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) were used as the templates for synthesis of ZSM-5 and 
MCM-41, respectively. 
The characteristic XRD peaks of ZSM-5 and MCM-41 are shown in Figure 1.  The XRD 
patterns for the BPMS hydrothermally synthesized at 373 K (pH = 11) for 12 h and consequently 
hydrothermal synthesized at 413 K (pH = 9) for 12-24 h were shown in Figures 2 and 3.  The 
characteristic peaks 2θ <5 (100) for MCM-41 and 2θ = 8-10 and 20-25 for ZSM-5 are observed 
in BPMS.  It is also found that the BPMS synthesized at 413 K for 18 h has a high crystallinity 
of MCM-41 and ZSM-5 structures.  High temperature or long hydrothermal time, however, may
