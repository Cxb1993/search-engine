Abstract 
Ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs) are those with diameters less than 100 nm. These particles are attracting 
increasing attention due to the important implications in human and environmental health. However, the 
systematic characterization of ambient UFPs is still lacking in Taiwan, particular their spatial and temporal 
variation. With that in mind, the present study set out to: (1) characterize the spatial and temporal variability of 
ambient UFP number size distributions in the Central Taiwan Air Quality Zone, (2) conduct an in-depth study of 
UFP mass-size distributions at a hotspot area for source identification, and (3) analyze the aerosol nucleation and 
growth rates based on empirical data and theory. The study sites include four types of environment (urban, coastal, 
mountain and downwind), which includes Taichung Jhongming, Changhua Siansi, Nantou Puli, and Jushan site, 
respectively. Particle number-size distributions in the size range of 10-1000 nm were measured by a scanning 
mobility particle size and condensation particle counter at the four sites during a cold and a warm period. It 
resulted in a total of 137 effective sampling days and 26,075 collected samples. The results indicate modest 
spatial heterogeneity, strong diurnal variability and variable sources of the submicrometer particle number size 
distributions in central Taiwan. In specific, the number concentrations were typically higher at the urban site, 
whereas 29-49% lower and comparable at the three other sites. The strong correlations with CO and NOx suggest 
traffic emissions are the dominant source of UFPs. At the urban site, a nano micro-orifice uniform deposit 
impactor was used to collect size-segregated particles on PTFE filters over a year. The filters were then subjected 
to gravimetric and trace metals analyses. A total of 57 sets of samples were collected. The results show UFP mass 
concentrations (PM0.1) were higher in the summer than in the winter, and that it showed negligible correlations 
with PM1, PM2.5 and PM10. This trend indicates the UFP sources as well as atmospheric lifetimes are different 
from larger particles. During the study duration, we observed frequent and intense new particle formation and 
growth events during the summer at the urban site. Theoretical analysis shows the nucleation rates were 
substantially higher than earlier studies, suggesting the precursor concentrations are very high in the present 
urban air, or that the nucleation mechanisms are different from other areas. In addition to complementing earlier 
studies, the results of the present study will serve as a starting point for future in-depth UFP number/mass size 
distribution studies that are pertinent to obtaining a more representative assessment of their impact on human and 
environmental health.

 Spatial variability of particle number concentrations has been commonly studied by taking measurements 
as a function of distance from the emission source. These studies have shown a continuous decrease of particle 
number concentrations while the particles are advecting away from the road (e.g., Zhu et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 
2004; Kittelson et al., 2004; Westerdahl et al., 2005; Buonanno et al., 2009). Zhu et al. (2002; 2004) showed that 
the particle number, as well as copollutants CO and BC, decreases exponentially with distance and then becomes 
inextinguishable from the background level at a distance of 300 m. The authors also noted that the decrease rate is 
slower in the winter than in the summer. The resulting changes in the number size distribution during the 
road-to-ambient process were attributed largely to condensation, evaporation and dilution, and to a lesser extent 
to coagulation and deposition (Zhang et al., 2004). Another way to determine spatial variability is to take 
measurements at several locations within a city or region. However, data from this type of study are still 
relatively sparse. Harrison and Jones (2005) showed that the particle number concentrations at seven out of eight 
sites in the UK were generally similar, suggesting little inter-urban variability in the urban air. One-year 
concurrent measurements of particle number at five different sites in the Los Angeles Basin showed low to 
modest spatial correlations for particle number (Sardar et al., 2004). More recently, Moore et al. (2009) found the 
intra-community variability of ultrafine particle concentrations at 14 sites in urban Los Angeles is comparable to 
and exceeds the inter-community variability presented in earlier studies. In the same study, the concentration 
variability of smaller particles (< 40 nm) was found to be higher than larger particles (Krudysz et al., 2009). A 
follow-up study by Hudda et al. (2010), with additional measurements at receptor sites up to 115 km downwind 
to Los Angeles, confirmed that the intra-community variability was larger than the inter-community variability. 
The US EPA has noted that spatial variability has been the largest uncertainty of exposure estimates in 
population-based epidemiological studies (US EPA, 2010b).  
Earlier studies of UFP in Taiwan have focused primarily on particle mass and chemical composition (e.g., 
Lin et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2010a). Measurements of ambient submicrometer or ultrafine 
particle number size distributions are lacking until recent years (Chang and Lee, 2007; Chen et al., 2010b; Cheng 
et al., 2010a; Cheng et al., 2010b; Chen et al., 2011). Despite these progresses, the spatial and temporal variability 
of particle number size distributions has yet been addressed. With that in mind, the present study selected four 
sampling sites in the Central Taiwan Air Quality Zone (CTAQZ) for characterizing the spatial and temporal 
variability of submicrometer particle number size distributions. The selected sites encompass relatively diverse 
environments, including urban, coastal, mountain and downwind areas. Measurements were carried out 
consecutively among the sites during a cold and a warm period. In addition to complementing earlier studies, the 
results of the present study will serve as a starting point for future in-depth particle number size distribution 
studies that are pertinent to obtaining a more representative assessment of their impact on human and 
environmental health.

sampling set up was nearly identical among all the sites, described in the following. Ambient sample air was 
drawn through the site rooftop at a flow rate of 8 liters min-1 (lpm) with a 3-m vertical glass tube, of which 2.5-m 
was extended outside and shielded inside an aluminum tube. A short stainless steel forward-facing probe was 
inserted into the glass tube to draw a small portion of the sample air into the SMPS through a 1.5-m conductive 
tubing at 0.3 lpm. The diffusion loss to the glass and conductive sample line was estimated to be ~15% for the 
smallest measureable particles of 11.1 nm (Baron and Willeke, 2001), though no loss corrections were made to 
the measured data. The air conditioners inside the sites were activated only when the indoor temperature 
exceeded 31 °C; therefore, the indoor as well as the sample air temperature basically follows the ambient 
temperature trend. For example, the highest daily ambient temperature of 31.5 °C was slightly higher than the 
sample air temperature inside the differential mobility analyzer (DMA) of 29.5 °C on that same day. Similarly, 
the lowest daily ambient temperature of 11.8 °C was slightly lower than the sample air temperature inside the 
DMA of 15.4 °C on that same day. As a result, there were no observed water condensation issues with the 
sampling tube. 
The SMPS consists of a long Vienna-type differential mobility analyzer (L-DMA; Model 55-900) and a 
butanol-based condensation particle counter (CPC; Model 5.403). The operating principles of the system are 
described in detail elsewhere (Winklmayr et al., 1990; Reischl et al., 1997; Heim et al., 2004). The inlet of the 
L-DMA consists of an impactor with a 50% collection efficiency of 1082 nm, followed by an Am-241 neutralizer 
(Model 5.522). With its default set up, the inner electrode of the L-DMA is positively charged. The detectable 
aerosol mobility diameters range from 11.1 to 1083.3 nm (44 size bins) with a sheath and sample flow of 3 lpm 
and 0.3 lpm, respectively. Due to the humid condition in Taiwan, the sheath air is dried to a RH of ~10% through 
a silica gel canister and then passed through a HEPA filter before entering the L-DMA. The saturator and 
condensor temperature of the CPC was set at 40 °C and 15 °C, respectively. It has a 50% counting efficiency at 
4.5 nm and measures number concentration up to 2×104 cm-3 with single particle counting and coincidence 
correction, and up to 107 cm-3 with the photometric mode. The SMPS was set to down-scan 6 min and 26 s from 
10,000 to 5 V plus a wait-time 34 s, producing one average particle number size distribution every 7 min. The 
SMPS has been routinely sent back to the manufacturer for calibration each year. In addition, prior to the study 
the sizing accuracy was determined by sampling NaCl of known mobility sizes (50, 76, 113, 168, and 241 nm) 
from a monodisperse aerosol generator (TSI; Model 3475), simultaneously with another SMPS (TSI; Model 
3936). The differences between the expected sizes and the measured mode sizes were less than 3 nm.  
The mass-size distributions of ambient aerosols at the urban (hotspot) site were measured by a nano 
micro-orifice uniform deposit impactor (NanoMOUDI-IITM; Model 122R, MSP) over a year from November 
2009 to October 2010. In specific, the NanoMOUDI was modified to segregate ambient aerosols into 9 size 
fractions: 0.01-0.018, 0.018-0.032, 0.032-0.056, 0.056-0.1, 0.1-0.32, 0.32-1, 1-2.5, and 2.5-10 µm. The sample 
10 
number size distributions. The hourly aerosol, air pollutants and meteorological data were then used to compute 
Pearson product moment correlation coefficients (r) and to determine the temporal variation. In addition, the 
correlation matrices were used as input files in the principal component (PC) analysis described below.  
PC analyses with orthogonal varimax rotation were applied to the time-resolved particle number, air 
pollutant and meteorological data to identify potential sources of size-fractionated particle numbers. Each site’s 
datasets for the cold and warm period were combined together for analysis in order to cover more diverse 
pollutant levels and meteorological conditions as well as increasing the sample size. Particles were segregated 
into three groups, namely NNUC, NAIT, and NACC. Other input parameters include SO2, CO, O3, NO, NO2, PM10, 
PM2.5, T, RH and WS. The statistical package was from SPSS version 12.0.1C. 
The mean particle number size distributions for each site and study period were fitted with three lognormal 
distributions to identify the underlying sub-modes. The tri-modal fitting process was done using the following 
distribution function (df): 
df = Aexp �− �lnDp − lnDm�W �                                                                                                   (1) 
where A sets the amplitude (peak height), Dm sets the particle mode diameter, and W sets the peak width. The 
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, a nonlinear least-squares fitting, is used to search for the minimum value of 
chi-square (χ2) (Igor Pro v.6.2.2.2, WaveMetrics, Inc.). The square root of dN for each size bin (i.e., the 
measurement uncertainty of particle counter) was used in the calculation of χ2 to obtain a more accurate fit as 
follows: 
χ2 = ��y − yiwi �                                                                                                                            (2) 
where y is the fitted value, yi is the measured value, and wi is the measurement uncertainty for size bin i. The 
tri-modal fitting terminates after 40 passes in searching for the best fit, or will quit if 9 passes in a row do not 
result in a decrease in χ2. 
To calculate nucleation rates (J) and growth rates (GR) from ambient measurements of aerosol size 
distributions, we used an inversion program, Particle Growth and Nucleation (PARGAN). This model has been 
described in detail elsewhere (Verheggen and Mozurkewich, 2006) and the PARGAN user interface is available at 
http://iacweb.ethz.ch/php/pargan/. Briefly, the input of the PARGAN model is the banana‐shaped aerosol size 
distribution data, and the output is GR, on the basis of which J values are further derived. PARGAN derives GR 
and J values from the measured aerosol size distributions with the inversion method, by assuming that 
consecutive measurements at the same site are representative of the history of the air mass. This assumption is not 
specific to PARGAN, as it also applies to other methods to derive GR from the measurements. The nucleation

measured at the urban site for the cold and warm period, respectively. These mean NTOT were comparable to that 
measured at a number of urban sites worldwide, in street canyon and at roadside, but lower than that measured on 
road and inside tunnels (Stanier et al., 2004a; Harrison and Jones, 2005; Aalto et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2009; 
Lonati et al., 2011; Bae et al., 2010; Asmi et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2010a; Cheng et al., 2010a; 
Cheng et al., 2010b). The mean NTOT at the coastal, mountain, and downwind site were similar, in the range of 
1.7×104-2.2×104 cm-3. These values are 29-49% lower than that measured at the urban site, attributable to the 
substantially higher NUFP (i.e., NNUC+NAIT) at the urban site. This observation is consistent with earlier studies 
that showed higher number concentrations at sites impacted by heavy traffic, whereas lower concentrations were 
more or less homogeneously distributed at background or receptor sites (Harrison and Jones, 2005; Hudda et al., 
2010; Bae et al., 2010). Another explanation to the higher NUFP is the frequent NPF events observed at the urban 
site during the warm period, discussed later in Section 3.3. On the other hand, excluding the storm-impacted 
downwind site, the lowest mean NTOT of 1.7×104-1.8×104 cm-3 were measured at the mountain site during both 
the cold and warm period. As the highest average PM2.5 levels (up to 47.7 µg m-3) were typically observed at the 
mountain site, it suggests that the elevated pre-existing particles are not conducive for the survival of the ultrafine 
particles (r = -0.25; see Section 3.5), in addition to the weaker UFP source strength. Modeling studies have shown 
that nucleation particles are quickly removed by coagulation with larger background particles or by 
condensational growth, with time scales of as small as 0.01-0.1 hr (Pandis et al., 1995; Kerminen et al., 2004). 
Zhu et al. (2004) observed traffic-related particle number size distributions become indistinguishable from 
background at a downwind distance of ~150 m during the summer. 
The summary statistics of daily mean NTOT on weekdays and weekends are given in Table S1. As shown, the 
weekday and weekend averages of daily mean NTOT during the cold and warm period were similar; overall, the 
weekday and weekend NTOT were 2.3×104 and 2.2×104 cm-3, respectively, with a slightly higher variability during 
the weekend. Asmi et al. (2011) also have shown no statistically significant variation of concentrations between 
weekdays and weekend in numerous European sites. The mean NTOT at each site during the warm period was 
generally higher than that during the cold period, between which he site-specific seasonal differences were < 22 
%. This shows the weekday-to-weekend as well as the cold-to-warm seasonal variability is smaller than the 
afore-presented site-to-site spatial variability of NTOT. Unlike the present study, many studies have shown a 
distinct seasonal pattern and weekday-weekday differences in particle number concentrations, with higher levels 
observed in colder months and during weekdays (Singh et al., 2006; Aalto et al., 2005; Stanier et al., 2004a; 
Harrison and Jones, 2005; Moore et al., 2009; Birmili et al., 2010; Bae et al., 2010; Lonati et al., 2011). For 
example, Paatero et al. (2005) have shown a negative correlation between particle number and T, where the later 
covers a range from -3 to 28 °C. Such discrepancy is likely a result of the small temperature difference (~7 °C) 
between the present two study periods. In addition, Marawska et al. (2008) suggested that seasonal variability is 
14 
the NPF and growth events during the traffic rush hours, midday and afternoon hours at the four sites will follow 
in subsequent publication. 
The statistical presentations (16th, 50th, 84th percentiles and mean) of the site-specific particle number size 
distributions during the two study periods are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Also shown in the figures are the 
trimodal lognormal fits to the mean particle number size distributions. The site-specific size distributions showed 
considerable temporal variability. In specific, the mean concentrations are typically higher than the 50th 
percentile concentrations for particles in the UFP size range. All the size distributions exhibited two dominant 
modes, namely the nucleation and Aitken mode, and a minor accumulation mode. The selection of trimodal fits is 
because bimodal fits, in a number of cases, failed to account for the accumulation particles. Such trimodality is in 
large contrast to the median size distributions measured at numerous European sites, most of which are well 
described by unimodal distribution (Asmi et al., 2011). In this study, the location and intensity (i.e., size and 
concentration) of the modes show considerable site-to-site and cold-to-warm variability. Nevertheless, three 
common features are summarized as follows. First, a nucleation mode is always present in the site-specific mean 
size distributions for the cold and warm period.  This indicates the omnipresence of freshly-formed particles. 
Second, the mode sizes are always smaller during the cold period. This feature may be related to the lower 
temperature during the cold period (Table 2), of which favors the formation of fresh and smaller particles. Third, 
the concentrations of the accumulation mode particles are always considerably higher during the cold period. This 
feature is consistent with the considerably higher PM levels during the cold period (Table 3). Overall, the results 
show that there is notable variability in the particle number size distributions among sites and between study 
periods, despite they may have similar NTOT. This suggests that the total particle number concentration alone may 
not be a representative exposure or impact estimate, both of which depend on particle size.  
3.4 Diurnal Variations of Submicrometer Particles 
The diurnal variability of hourly mean NTOT and air pollutants concentrations at each site during the two 
study periods are shown in Figures 5 and S2, respectively. During the cold period, the NTOT at the urban, 
downwind and mountain site showed distinct and consistent diurnal patterns with peak concentrations at 08-09 
and 17-19 local time (LT). The peak concentrations ranged from 1.6×104 cm-3 to 4.4×104 cm-3, between which 
higher values were measured at the urban site and lower ones at the mountain site. Many other studies have 
shown such a daily two-peak pattern, particularly in the urban area and on workdays (Wehner and Wiedensolher, 
2003; Hussein et al., 2004; Stanier et al., 2004a; Harrison and Jones, 2005; Birmili et al., 2010). The temporal 
patterns of CO and NOx, to a lesser extent for SO2, correlated well with that of NTOT, especially during the 
morning traffic rush hour. This indicates that those particles were predominantly from traffic emissions. Unlike 
others, the coastal site showed less-pronounced morning peak concentration at 08-09 LT and no obvious evening 
16 
share a common source.  
3.6 Potential Sources of Size-Fractionated Particle Numbers  
The site-specific varimax-rotated factor loadings, eigenvalues and explained variance for each resolved 
principal component (PC) are given in Table 6. The number of resolved PC was determined with a cutoff 
eigencalue of unity. As the focus is on size-segregated particle numbers, we will not extend our discussion on the 
identified “ozone” or “SO2” PC in the analyses. 
At the urban site, PC1 shows high positive loadings on NACC, PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and CO, whereas moderate 
positive loadings on NO and SO2 and moderate negative loading on WS. The former shows that the NACC at the 
urban site were strongly associated with NO2 and CO from traffic exhaust. Furthermore, the NACC followed 
closely with the temporal pattern of PM10 and PM2.5 despite that the accumulation particles contribute only 14-19 
% of the total particle numbers at the urban site (Figures 5 and S2, and Table 4). This is because a significant 
fraction of fine particle mass is composed of particles in the accumulation size range. For example, Li and Lin 
(2002) have shown that the average PM1/PM2.5 ratio at an urban and traffic site in the Taipei City, Taiwan were 
0.76 and 0.88, respectively. A similar high fraction of PM1 in PM2.5 was also shown in a study beside a 
heavy-traffic road (Lin et al., 2005). The moderate negative loading on WS indicates that the pollutants associated 
with PC1 were largely of local origin, i.e., concentrations increase with decreasing wind speed. PC3 shows high 
positive loadings on NAIT and NNUC, whereas moderate positive loadings on CO and NO. This shows that the UFP 
at the urban site were also related to traffic exhaust. However, unlike the accumulation particles, the UFP 
correlated stronger with NO than with NO2. This suggests that the UFP were freshly-emitted from nearby mobile 
sources because NO has a substantial shorter atmospheric lifetime than NO2 in polluted tropospheric conditions 
(Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts, 2000). The three extracted components together explained a sum of 70% total variance 
in the dataset.  
At the coastal site, PC1 shows high positive loadings on NO2, CO, NO and SO2, and high negative loading 
on O3, whereas moderate positive loadings on NAIT and NACC. The strong positive correlations with the primary 
gas pollutants show that the Aitken and accumulation particles were associated with traffic exhaust. Furthermore, 
the increase of traffic-related pollutant concentrations coincided with a decrease of O3 concentration. It is well 
known that pollutants in combustion plumes (e.g., NOx and organics) reacts with ambient O3, subsequently 
causes a concentration decrease of O3 (e.g., Wehner and Wiedensohler, 2003; Sardar et al., 2004). Such a negative 
correlation is in fact clearly seen in all the pollutant temporal plots (Figure S2), though only picked up at the 
coastal site by the PC analyses because the O3 concentrations at other sites were much stronger related to T, RH 
and WS. PC2 shows high positive loadings on NACC, PM10 and PM2.5, whereas moderate positive loadings on SO2 
and CO. Like the urban site, the temporal patterns of the accumulation particles at the coastal site followed 
18 
windy condition. Similar to that at the coastal site, this suggests that the nucleation particles were likely 
photochemically-driven, related to SO2 conversion to H2SO4. In addition, this PC2 has no significant loadings on 
the traffic-related primary pollutants (CO and NOx). However, unlike the coastal site, higher wind speeds at the 
downwind site were positively correlated with NNUC, SO2 and O3. Regional transport of air pollutants is favored 
under higher wind speeds in the earlier afternoon, during which the solar radiation is also most intense. With that 
in mind, PC2 suggests that elevated SO2, O3 and nucleation particle concentrations are likely due to transport 
from upwind regions and driven by strong photochemistry. PC3 shows high positive loadings on NNUC and NO, 
whereas moderate positive loadings on NAIT and CO. This indicates the UFP were related to traffic exhaust. PC2 
and PC3 together illustrates that there are two possible sources, namely traffic emissions (primary source) and 
SO2-related photochemically-driven production (secondary source), impacting the UFP at the downwind site. The 
three extracted components together explained a sum of 74% total variance in the dataset.  
Overall, the PC analyses showed that the accumulation particles at the urban, mountain and downwind site 
are predominantly associated with traffic-related CO and NO2, except for the coastal site where they show a 
stronger connection with traffic-related SO2. In addition, without exceptions, the temporal pattern of the 
accumulation particles tightly follows that of the PM2.5 and PM10. The Aitken and nucleation particles are closely 
related to each other, though poorly correlated with the accumulation particles, PM2.5, and PM10. Nevertheless, 
similar to the accumulation particles, the UFP are predominantly associated with traffic exhaust (CO, NO and 
NO2). Regardless of particle sizes, the generally stronger correlations between particle number and NOx are 
consistent with the findings by Paatero et al. (2005). The authors showed that NOx are by far the most important 
variables for predicting particle number concentrations in five European cities. In this study, however, there may 
be another source of UFP at the coastal and downwind site, likely related to photochemistry and SO2 plume from 
nearby industrial sources and regional transport, respectively. Considering the ultrafine and accumulation 
particles have a common traffic (primary) source but poorly correlated with each other, it suggests that each of 
the two particle fractions has another source (e.g., secondary photochemistry) not shared by the other, and/or they 
have different loss processes in the atmosphere. For example, the much longer atmospheric lifetime of the 
accumulation particles allows them to survive under polluted environment, in which the UFP are quickly 
scavenged by pre-existing particles.  
3.7 Size-Fractionated Particle Mass  
The average mass-size distribution for each season is presented in Figure 6. As shown, the modal 
characteristics were rather similar between seasons. The size distributions all exhibit two major modes, one 
between 0.32-1 µm and the other between 2.5-10 µm. It is also important to note that there may be a third mode 
at the ultrafine size range. The only major difference was the modal concentration, i.e., highest in the winter and 
20 
(Figure 2). Here, we present a case study of a NPF event observed at Aug.-12, 2010 at the urban site (Figure 10). 
It shows a burst of <20 nm particles at around 8:30 am, followed by intense particle growth until midday. 
Following that, interestingly, the particles began to shrink in size until 4:30 pm. The PARGAN derived particle 
growth (or shrinkage) rates (GR) and nucleation rates (J) with respect to time are presented in Figure 11. The GR 
values were up to 10 nm hr-1 and the J values up to 500 cm-3 s-1. Although the observed GR values were 
comparable to earlier studies, whereas the J values were substantially higher than earlier studies (Kulmala et al., 
2004; Erupe et al., 2010; Salma et al., 2011). The results highlight that the formation mechanism at the present 
urban site may be different from other areas. 
4. Conclusion 
This study presents first measurements of the submicrometer (10-1000 nm) particle number size 
distributions at four types of environment (urban, coastal, mountain and downwind) within the central Taiwan air 
quality zone during a cold (20.5 °C) and a warm (27.6 °C) period. The urban site showed the highest average 
submicrometer particle number concentration of up to 3.4 × 104 cm-3, which is 29 to 49% higher than the coastal, 
mountain and downwind site. The latter three sites showed comparable number concentration, ranging from 1.7 × 
104 to 2.2 × 104 cm-3. The average submicrometer particle number concentration at each site showed small 
variability (< 22%) between the cold and warm period, despite notable differences in the meteorological 
conditions and air quality. During the cold period, the hourly submicrometer particle number concentrations 
showed distinct diurnal patterns at all but the coastal site with peak concentrations coincided with traffic 
emissions during rush hours (CO and NOx). During the warm period, the diurnal patterns across the four sites 
were more variable and the influence of traffic emissions was relatively weaker, whereas the photochemistry and 
SO2 were driving the observed midday peak concentrations. Despite having similar submicrometer particle 
number concentrations, the modal characteristics of the measured particle number size distributions exhibited 
notable spatial and temporal differences. The ultrafine particles and accumulation particles correlated poorly with 
each other, even though both were closely connected to traffic emissions. In addition, the latter was highly 
correlated with PM2.5 and PM10. Such disconnection was likely due to the influences of sources other than road 
traffic and/or the differences in their loss processes in ambient air at different study locations. Overall, the results 
indicate modest spatial heterogeneity and strong diurnal variability of the submicrometer particle number size 
distributions in central Taiwan. Such spatial, temporal variability and particularly the site-specific emission 
sources would not have been elucidated if the size distributions and copollutants were not measured 
simultaneously.  
In view of the spatial, temporal and source variability of the submicrometer particles, it is suggested that 
measuring the “total” particle number concentrations without discriminating particle sizes, or using PM mass 
concentrations to estimate particle numbers would be inappropriate in exposure assessment for health studies. It

本研究首度在台灣中部空品區進行多地點、長時間之超細微粒(數量與質量)
濃度粒徑分布調查，其學術價值包括(1)協助本土資料之蒐集、(2)研究軟硬
體之建置、(3)超細微粒污染時空分布之鑑別。前述項目有重要與廣泛之應用
價值，包括對於台灣中部空品區超細微粒污染之問題嚴重程度與特性得以有
初步之了解，亦為後續進一步生成機轉研究奠定重要之基石。最終之成果可
做為未來政府單位了解民眾暴露現況、訂定管制標準與研擬控制策略之參考。 
 
 
 
 
 
空間，尤其在資源的整合、先進量測技術與進階模式的應用等。就台灣氣膠研究整體而言，
儘管國人亦有許多非常優秀的氣膠研究，但在大部分氣膠次領域中仍有相當程度的落差，
尤其是超細(奈米)微粒的環境與職場暴露評估、毒理試驗、生成與成長機制及氣候變遷衝
擊探討等。畢竟參與氣膠研究的國人人數遠不及國外人數，國人更應該整合設備資源與研
究專長，建立國家型氣膠研究團隊，才足以趕上國外研究的深度與廣度。本人每年皆至少
參與一次美國氣膠學會的相關研討會，今年的會議我依然受益良多。

四、建議 
以下有幾點心得與建議: 
1. 空氣污染應該屬於健康導向(health-oriented)的整合型研究； 
2. 整合的領域應包括污染源評估、暴露評估、劑量評估與健康風險等領域之結合； 
3. 研究結果須能應用於政策，包括健康風險防制與污染源擬定管制策略之擬定。

Dear Dr. Young:  
 
Thank you first of all for submitting an abstract to the 2010 AAAR Specialty Conference entitled “Air Pollution and Health:  
Bridging the Gap from Sources to Health Outcomes” to be held in San Diego, California, March 22-26, 2010.  This landmark 
conference already includes over 400 presentations covering the full source to health effects paradigm, as well as policy of air 
pollution and health.  Of these, 112 have been assigned to platform presentations.  Along with platform and poster sessions, there 
will be 33 Plenary Presentations in 9 sessions, two planned panel discussions, and several high U.S. ranking government officials 
have been invited for Friday morning.  The conference will be opened by a recent past Chairman of the California Air Resources 
Board.  It will no doubt be a full and exciting week. This letter is to inform you about the acceptance of your abstract and to 
provide instructions for the presentations and details about the conference logistics. 
 
Abstract selection for platform presentations was based on several considerations with the goal of providing a balanced and 
widely representative selection of topics and scientific approaches.  We did not follow the science questions due to an uneven 
distribution of submissions across the science questions.  Some of the abstracts assigned to poster presentations have been moved 
to a different science question/science topic (sq/t) for better fit and balance across science questions and topics.  
 
On behalf of the Conference Committees, Maria Costantini and I are very pleased to inform you that your abstract has been 
accepted as a poster presentation.  Specifics of the session will be available before the end of January 2010, on the AAAR 
website for the conference.  Your paper will be listed in the technical program as follows:  
 
Session 15: Thursday, 1:45 pm - 3:45 pm 
Paper Number: 15.SQ3.T3.216 
Multisite study of ambient sub-micrometer and ultrafine particles in the central Taiwan airshed during cold months.  Yi-
Ting Wang, Hung-Chieh Hsu, LI-HAO YOUNG, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan 
 
Instructions for poster presentations  
If your abstract has been accepted as a poster presentation, please note the size of the poster is approximately 4 ft x 4 ft [1.2 m x 
1.2 m].  Four poster sessions are planned, one each day, Monday – Thursday.  Posters will remain up for only two days (Monday 
– Tuesday; Wednesday – Thursday) and will be removed in between.  Specific details as to when posters should be installed and 
removed will be provided in future emails and in the conference program.   
 
Since a summary paper is being prepared, we request that you provide a PDF of your poster.  This will help ensure that your 
information is properly represented.  Please visit the speaker ready room to download your poster PDF to the conference 
computer.

以下有幾點心得與建議: 
1. 氣膠化學不僅只可能直接影響人類健康，還更廣泛的影響大氣化
學，故有全球衛生(如氣候暖化)之意含； 
2. 氣膠化學研究應更廣泛的整合化學、物理、大氣、環工與公衛領域，
方能顧及全球、區域及個人衛生問題； 
3. 研究結果須能應用於政策，包括全球氣候暖化防制、區域污染源管
制策略與個人健康風險防制等。

Dear Dr. Li-Hao Young, 
 
Thank you for submitting a scientific paper for the 2010 International Chemical Congress of Pacific Basin Societies 
[Pacifichem 2010]. More than 12,000 chemists from all nationalities and all areas of chemistry are expected to attend this 
six-day scientific meeting which will be held in Honolulu, HI, December 15 - 20, 2010. Additional meeting information can 
be found on the official meeting website at www.pacifichem.org. 
 
Verification of Paper Acceptance  
According to our records in the Program and the Scholar One Abstract System, the following abstract has been accepted 
for presentation at the meeting: 
 
Presenter: Dr. Li-Hao Young 
Paper Title: Mass-size distribution and inorganic composition of wintertime urban inhalable and ultrafine aerosols 
Symposium/Area: (8) Environmental Chemistry/(237) Environmental Chemistry of Aerosols 
 
Registration & Housing 
All Pacifichem 2010 attendees, including speakers and poster presenters, must register for the meeting in order to 
participate in the technical programs and meeting events. Attendees must display their badges at all times in order to be 
admitted to official Pacifichem sessions and events. If you have been invited to speak by a symposium organizer and 
offered assistance with your registration and/or travel expenses, you should contact your symposium organizer directly to 
clarify the terms of the invitation and to determine who will complete your registration.  
 
You can reserve a hotel room within the official Pacifichem housing block [beginning February 12, 2010] and register for 
the meeting [beginning June 25, 2010] at the website www.pacifichem.org. 
Registering before the early registration deadline allows you to take advantage of the lowest registration fees. Hotel rooms 
at the special discounted Pacifichem rates sell out very quickly, so do not wait to reserve your room. 
 
Cancellations & Withdrawals 
If you are unable to attend the meeting to make your presentation, it is important that you inform the session chair that you 
must withdraw from the meeting. If you have already registered or booked your hotel room before you find out you cannot 
attend, you should visit the meetings website to read the cancellation policy for registration and housing. 
 
International Presenters and Visa Support 
Information about the US Visa Process, the Visa Waiver program, and Visa Problems can be found on the Pacifichem 
website.  
 
Procedures for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP), which enables citizens of certain countries to travel to the United States 
for tourism or business for 90 days or less without obtaining a visa, changed in January 2009. Every visitor traveling under 
the VWP must register under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) 72 hours in advance of travel. Please 
see the American Chemical Society's 'Travel to the US' page at http://portal.acs.org/portal/Navigate?nodeid=1320 (or visit 
the State Department Website http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/without/without_1990.html) for more information about the 
new VWP procedures. 
 
If you are not eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, it is important that you determine the appropriate visa category for 
travel. Please see the ACS 'Travel to the US' page at http://portal.acs.org/portal/Navigate?nodeid=1320 for more 
information. 
 
If you need to apply for a temporary non-immigrant visa to attend the conference, you are advised to apply for your visa as 
soon as travel to the United States is contemplated and not later than 3-4 months in advance. International participants 
should start the visa process during June 2010. If your country of residence is different from your country of citizenship or 
birth, we recommend starting the application process at least 6 months in advance of the meeting. All applicants must be 
able to qualify for a visa on their own merits under the requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Pacifichem 
2010 cannot intervene with the U.S. State Department or an American embassy in another country on behalf of any
