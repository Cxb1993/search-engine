For those products that are heavily competitive in the marketplace, particularly IT products,
market demand has become increasing volatile because of such factors as accelerating economic
cycle, intense competition, fickle consumer preferences and rapid evolution of product and
processing technology. This has frequently led to a sizable deviation of demand forecast when
using traditional forecasting methods, such as moving average, regression, exponential smoothing,
seasonal exponential smoothing, and so on, which are essentially defined and developed in time
series analysis or causal modeling. (see Markidakis & Wheelwright 1985 for detailed discussion)
These traditional forecasting methods are subject to fail to adequately seize and manage the
components of random variability of demand. These biased forecasts inevitably impact the
precision and effectiveness of sequent production scheduling and manufacturing resource
planning.
Accordingly, this study endeavors to develop an approach to demand forecasting based on
the real option approach to predict demand for each period (time bucket) during the upcoming
planning horizon for products with high random demand volatility. The real option approach can
effectively deal with the long-term trend and random variation in any given demand stochastic
diffusion process. The real option approach was originally conceived by Myers (1977), who
considered that the corporate asset is comprised by present-day assets and growing option on real
assets. The growing option represents the present value of future corporate investment
opportunities, which can vary according to selected business strategy. Thus, the approach used to
assess the growing option on real assets was termed the real option approach. Afterwards, the real
option framework and approach was continually expanded and improved by numerous authors,
including Trigeorgis & Manson (1987), Hurry et al. (1992), Trigeorgis (1993b，1997), He &
Pindyck (1992), Dixit & Pindyck (1995), and so on. Meanwhile, some authors such as Pindyck
(1988), Perlitz et al. (1999), Trigeorgis (1993a, 1997, 1999), Kulatilaka & Trigeorgis (1994), and
so on, have incorporated additional types of underlying decision flexibility into the real option
approach.
According to the literature survey, the real option approach was primarily applied to making
decisions on corporate investment projects (for example, Taudes (1998), McGrath & MacMillan
(2000), Bellalah (2002)) and corporate valuations (for example, Kellgg & Charnes (2000),
Schwartz & Moon (2000, 2001)), which are characterized by their high uncertainty and volatility
in relation to future cash flows. Regarding industrial applications, Benavides et al. (1999) applied
Geometric Brownian Motion to model demand forecasts for semiconductor products.
Barnes-Schuster et al. (2002) and Nembhard et al. (2003) respectively employed the real option
approach to assess supply chain contracts and outsourcing contracts. After going through
sustained evolution, the methodology of the real option approach has been quite mature so far.
Mun (2002) and Copeland and Antikarov (2001) broadly surveyed and discussed the recent
development and related applications relating to real options.
In many academic researches authors frequently assume that demand for a given product is
continuous and follows a normal distribution on the basis of the reason that the collective demand
is formed from numerous smaller demands received from individual customers. Silver et al.
(1998) recommended the normal distribution to function as the probability distribution of demand
for products with relatively higher demand. However, the postulation of normal distribution is
2.1 Modeling demand forecast
(1). Demand data
The first step in finding precise demand forecasts is to gather the complete and applicable
historical demand data for a given product. Demand data can be issued daily, weekly, monthly,
quarterly, or yearly depending on the length of the time bucket (period) within the planning
horizon.
(2). Demand behavior analysis
Demand behavior analysis is designed to create awareness of the demand shift pattern and
regularity. Specifically, demand behavior analysis is intended to identify the specified stochastic
diffusion process associated with the demand shift. As mentioned earlier, this study performed the
demand behavior analysis via the real option approach and used the stochastic differential
equation to model continuous-time demand shift process. Accordingly, this study introduces the
Ito process, which is widely applied for modeling the price shift behavior of highly volatile
financial assets, to materialize the stochastic differential equation of demand shift. The Ito
process also possesses the Markov property and comprises a permanent component of regular
drift that accounts for predictable long-term trends and a temporary component of random
diffusion that accounts for unpredictable random volatility. Formally, the Ito process for a random
variable tX can be formulated as follows.
tttt dztXdttXdX ),(),(   . (1)
Equation (1) is also known as the stochastic diffusion equation. Where ),( tX t is termed
the drift function, representing the component of regular drift and ),( tX t is termed the
diffusion function, representing the component of random diffusion. Also, variable tz is
assumed to satisfy the standard Wiener process, and its volatility can be expressed as
 ddz tt  , where t denotes a standard normal random variable and  represents a given
time interval. In case the drift and diffusion components are independent or not sensitive to the

The drift parameter  and volatility parameter  of (8) can be appropriately estimated
through the sample estimates ˆ and ˆ resulting from historical demand data. Assuming the

2.2 Acquiring the expected demand
(1). Demand simulation
Given the forecasting model of demand and knowing the practical demand 0X at the
beginning, demand can be simulated for each future period during the upcoming planning horizon.
The upcoming planning horizon is assumed to include T periods (time buckets) as shown in
Figure 2, meaning that a simulation path comprises T time nodes. Besides, N simulation paths are
generated when N simulating rounds are run. The following equation:

Step 7: If Mj  then calculate the final expected demand TtQt ,...,2,1,  and stop the

The antithetic method has been frequently used to accelerate the convergence. In the antithetic
method only TN )2/( random numbers are drawn and the N/2 simulation paths are created.
The remaining random numbers are obtained by multiplying the first TN )2/( random
numbers by–1, creating] an additional 2/N simulation paths. Figure 3 can help further clarify
the random sampling discipline used in the antithetic simulation method.

3. Provisioned smoothing capacity determining
Given the expected demands tQ for Tt ,...2,1 during the upcoming planning horizon, this
section suggests several methods for determining the smoothing capacity provided during the
upcoming planning horizon. Method selection should depend on the production strategy pursued.
First, define *C as provisioned smoothing capacity during the upcoming planning horizon.
(1). Capacity shortage minimizing strategy
When the opportunity costs associated with capacity shortage significantly exceed capacity
idle cost for the produced product, manufacturers can consider adopting the capacity shortage
minimizing strategy. Given adoption of the capacity shortage minimizing strategy, the
provisioned smoothing capacity is simply set to equal the maximal expected demand among all
expected demands during the upcoming planning horizon to minimize the likelihood of capacity
shortage. Restated,

(ii) Capacity idle risk managing strategy
Conversely, if the impact on capacity idle is heavier than that of capacity shortage,
manufacturers should consider taking the strategy for managing idle capacity risk. The capacity
idle risk managing strategy refers to the provisioned smoothing capacity being set to a certain
level such that the probability of capacity idle occurring for any time bucket will not exceed a
particular probability level (). Similarly, in the context of lognormal distribution the provisioned
smoothing capacity can be expressed and derived as follows.

(4). Capacity aggregate managing strategy
When the manufacturer intends to manage the aggregate amount of capacity shortage or
capacity idle during the upcoming planning horizon, it is possible to allow for adopting the
capacity aggregate managing strategy. Two selective strategies also exist depending on the need
to manage capacity shortage or capacity idle.
(i) Capacity shortage aggregate managing strategy
The capacity shortage aggregate managing strategy refers to the provisioned smoothing
capacity being set to a certain level such that the cumulative amount of capacity shortage during
the upcoming planning horizon will not exceed a particular level (say *Q ). Namely,

(31) can be solved by using repeated trials, an approach which begins from setting
shortage cost and expected unit capacity shortage cost for time bucket t. The expected unit
capacity shortage cost stands for either the opportunity cost associated with losing sales that can
be roughly counted as follows:
)( vttt ccpf  (36)
where tp and vc respectively is the expected sale price per product during time bucket t and
unit variable cost, or the additional outlay associated with the manufacturer using overtime or
subcontracting to compensate for the capacity gap. Meantime, the repetitive trial method is
again applied here.
4. Concluding remarks
Owing to factors such as accelerating economic cycles, intense competition, fickle consumer
preferences and rapid evolution of product and processing technology, this study perceives that
demand volatility and unpredictability has been constantly growing for those products that are
heavily competitive in the marketplace. Consequently, this tends to cause a sizable deviation in
demand forecasts when using traditional forecasting techniques. Accordingly, this study develops
a real option approach-based forecasting model for predicting demand during the upcoming
planning horizon for products with high random demand volatility. Additionally, this study
suggests using Monte Carlo simulation as a numerical method to solve the demand forecasting
model for competently dealing with the path-dependant property. Then, these demand forecasts
are used to determine the provisioned smoothing capacity during the upcoming planning horizon.
To this end, this study also proposes several effective capacity planning approaches based on the
selected production strategy.
In this study, although market demand is assumed to approximately fit the lognormal
distribution, which is considered to be applicable to quite a few demand cases for which the
demand are moderately high, in reality Monte Carlo simulation can project all kinds of
probabilistic distribution. Accordingly, the methodology presented here can be also applied to
other situations involving non-lognormal distribution, including such non-negative distributions
as Gamma distribution, geometric distribution, negative binomial distribution, and so on.
