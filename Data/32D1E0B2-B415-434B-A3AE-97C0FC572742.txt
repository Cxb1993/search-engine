that the loss of active dose due to deactivation is 
proportional to the implanted dose of nitrogen and 
the implantation dose of phosphorus. This implies 
that the complex is comprised of a nitrogen atom and 
a phosphorus atom. Based on this evidence, a process 
model for phosphorus and nitrogen coimplantation was

11. Introduction
In recent years, ultra-shallow junction (USJ) technology has developed for fabrication of
nanometer semiconductor devices. With the shrinkage of device dimensions, control of
punch-through leakage due to short channel effect (SCE) becomes important. Additionally, the
development of metal gate/high-dielectric technology also squeezes the thermal budget.
Therefore, how to obtain a higher activation level in the source/drain regions becomes the key
issue of USJs.
Although USJ profiles were produced near the surface, most of the dopants are inactive due to the
solid solubility limit. The solid solubility of dopants depends on temperature. Rapid thermal
annealing (RTA) was developed to increase the activation level of dopants and reduce the
junction depth. Therefore, the resistance of the source/drain regions can be reduced and SCE can
be suppressed. The rapid cooling of RTA leads to the high activation level in a meta-stable state.
The reduction of the junction depth using RTA technology is limited by transient enhanced
diffusion (TED), which is induced by implantation damage. Damage is recovered during
annealing while the released point defects cause TED subsequently. Dopant diffusion is enhanced
by TED over several orders of magnitude. This makes control of dopant distribution more
difficult.
TED is related to {311} defects. {311} defects are formed due to accumulation of interstitial.
Moreover, interstitials also react with implanted dopants to form dopant-interstitial clusters.
These defects dissolve during subsequent thermal process, and therefore release interstitials
causing TED. TED not only increases the junction depth but also reduce the activation level of
dopants due to the formation of dopant-interstitial clusters. One way to enhance activation level is
performing preamorphization implantation (PAI) to induce solid phase epitaxial growth (SPER)
during junction annealing. PAI can lower ion channeling effect. SPER eliminates damage in the
original amorphous layer. Therefore, the benefit of SPER is not only to improve the activation
level, but also to reduce TED.
Although the activation level of dopant can be improved by PAI and SPER using RTA or laser
annealing, dissolution of end-of-range (EOR) defects also causes dopant deactivation during
subsequent thermal processes. These EOR defects at the original amorphous/crystalline (A/C)
interface become an interstitial source to react with dopants. Dopant-interstitial clusters are
therefore formed and dopants are deactivated.
For coimplantation technology, carbon implantation effectively reduces the TED in the tail region
of phosphorus profiles by reducing interstitial concentration [1]. Preamorphization of silicon
caused by Ge coimplantation further suppresses TED [2,3] because SPER of the amorphous Si
(a-Si) layer increases the amount of substitutional carbon [4]. Additionally, strained Si:C layer
can be used in source and drain regions. Mechanisms of carbon diffusion and clustering have
been proposed [5-9]. The clustering mechanism suggests that trapping of interstitials in
carbon-interstitial clusters suppresses TED. However, interstitial-mediated carbon diffusion may
cause local undersaturation of interstitials. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which phosphorus
and carbon diffuse simultaneously is not well understood.
3concentration of the carbon diffusion tail and the EOR segregation peak in the samples that were
implanted with 5×1015 cm-2 carbon did not exceed that in the samples that were implanted with
1×1015 cm-2 carbon. This result implies that the concentration of mobile carbon interstitials did
not increased with the dose of implanted carbon. The diffusion of excess silicon self-interstitials
from the EOR region toward the SPER region is the bottleneck in the formation of carbon
interstitials. Therefore, the formation of carbon interstitials in the tail region governs the diffusion
of carbon. The peak concentration of carbon in the samples that were implanted at 5×1015 cm-2
did not exhibit any evident decay during RTA at 850 °C. The decay of carbon concentration was
observed only close to the tail region of the implantation profile.
Figure 1. Carbon diffusion profiles, measured by SIMS for samples that were implanted with
carbon at doses of (a) 1×1015 cm-2 and (b) 5×1015 cm-2 without phosphorus doping.
Figure 2(a) plots carbon diffusion profiles with and without phosphorus doping for samples with
a carbon implantation dose of 1×1015 cm-2. The influence of phosphorus doping on carbon
diffusion was not evident when RTA was performed at 850 °C for 5 s following furnace annealing
at 600 °C. Interestingly, phosphorus coimplantation significantly increased the concentration of
the carbon diffusion tail during RTA at 850 °C for 30 s. The carbon concentration in the peak
region exhibited serious simultaneous decay indicating that more carbon atoms in the peak region
became mobile carbon interstitials and diffused toward the tail region. Figure 2(b) shows the
corresponding phosphorus diffusion profiles. The phosphorus peak profile at concentrations
above 2×1020 cm-3 does not show evident redistribution during annealing. The phosphorus
diffusion profiles had plateaus beyond the phosphorus peak. Clearly, carbon tail diffusion was
enhanced when phosphorus diffused through the carbon peak region during RTA for 30 s. This

5increased. Previous studies have suggested that carbon causes vacancy supersaturation [7,9,15]
Therefore, the annihilation of interstitial supersaturation is believed to be related to the increase
in the vacancy level owing to the high carbon concentration. Interestingly, the behavior
associated with phosphorus diffusion also changed as the carbon implantation dose increased
from 1×1015 to 5×1015 cm-2. During RTA at 850 °C, the peak profile of the immobile phosphorus
that was observed in samples that were implanted with carbon at a dose of 1×1015 cm-2
disappeared. Cross-sectional TEM revealed a defect band with a depth of 15 nm near the surface
similar to that observed previously due to SPER at high carbon concentration [13]. However, as
phosphorus diffused though the surface defect band, box-shaped diffusion profiles of phosphorus
was obtained in the defect-free region. The diffusion tail of phosphorus was observed when
phosphorus diffused through the carbon peak region, indicating that a high carbon concentration
suppressed the tail diffusion of phosphorus. Vacancies are therefore believed to dominate the
diffusion mechanism of box-shaped phosphorus profiles.
Figure 3. Diffusion profiles of carbon and phosphorus for samples that were implanted with
carbon at a dose of 5×1015 cm-2 and phosphorus at a dose of 1×1015 cm-2. The diffusion profile of
carbon at the same carbon implantation dose but without phosphorus doping is shown for
comparison.
3. Nitrogen coimplantation
Czochralski grown (100) p-type silicon wafers were preamorphized with 40 keV Ge+ to a dose of
1×1015 cm-2 in order to produce an amorphous layer. This was followed by co-implantation of N2
at an energy of 11 keV to different doses. Samples were then implanted with phosphorus with at
an energy of 12 keV with various doses. After that, RTA was performed at a temperature ranging
from 600 to 700 °C. Furnace annealing at 750 °C for 50 min was performed to study the
influence of nitrogen diffusion on the phosphorus deactivation. The dose of active dopants was
analyzed by Hall measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also performed to
analyze the recrystallization behavior of the samples. Figure 4 shows that an amorphous layer
with a thickness around 60 nm was produced on the top of the samples after Ge+ implantation.

Figure 5. Sheet resistance (black line) and active carrier density (blue line) of samples during
RTA at (a) 600, (b) 700, and (c) 650 °C. Filled square (■) are for samples implanted with nitrogen
at a dose of 1.5×1015 cm-2 and P at a dose of 6×1014 cm-2. Open squares (□) are for samples
without nitrogen implantation.
In order to observe the breaking of the NP complexes, samples annealed at 650 oC for 120 s was
annealed again at 750 °C for 2 hours by using a furnace. Figure 6 shows the deactivation
behaviors of samples annealed at 750 °C. The result shows that active carrier density of the
sample implanted with nitrogen was close to the level without nitrogen implantation after
9To extract the quantity of NP complexes, the active carrier density of samples with nitrogen
implantation was subtracted from the corresponding samples which have the same phosphorus
implantation dose without nitrogen. Figure 8 shows the results that the density of NP complexes
was proportional to the phosphorus and nitrogen doses.
