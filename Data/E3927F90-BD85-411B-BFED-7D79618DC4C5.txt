英文摘要
Keywords: blocked polyurethane; epoxy; interpenetrating polymer network (IPN)
Epoxy shows the excellent chemical and physical properties, which have been widely used in
coatings, adhesives, insulations, laminates and composites. However, epoxy could not be utilized
in some applications for lack of impact strength. Blocked polyurethane shows some unique
properties, including high impact strength and elasticity. However, blocked PU could not be
utilized in some applications for lack of mechanical and thermal properties. Hence, the project is
going to synthesize blocked PU/epoxy interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) using
simultaneous interpenetrating networks (SIN) method. The blocked PU and epoxy can modify
each other that epoxy can be improved the impact strength, and the blocked PU can be improved
the mechanical and thermal properties.

1.Introduction
Polyurethane (PU) resins shows some unique properties, including excellent elastically,
excellent abrasion resistance, high impact strength, and elongation, which have been widely in
adhesives, coatings, synthetic leather, construction, automatic applications and shoe soles.
However, polyurethane could not be utilized in some applications for lack of mechanical modulus
and thermal resistance. Epoxy resins are the desired materials for many important applications
such as adhesives, semiconductor encapsulants and structural matrices, due to their high thermal
resistance, high tensile strength and modulus, and good chemical resistance. However, epoxy
widespread use is limited in many high-performance applications due to their inherent brittleness.
Hence, a blending technique is applied utilizing interpenetrating polymer networks (IPN) of two
polymer components that can improve the deficiencies of each individual resin. Interpenetrating
polymer networks (IPN) are a special class of polymer blends in which the polymers are
crosslinked. These material are characterized by the presence of two networks strongly entangled
ideally only by topological constraints.
The interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) is a unique type of polyblend; it is defined as a
mixture of two or more crosslinked polymer networks that have partial or total physical
interlocking between them. IPN can be viewed as the crosslinking of one component in the
presence of another already crosslinked polymer network. Two types of IPN may be formed,
depending on whether the polymer components are crosslinked or not that it can mainly be
classified into full-IPN and semi-IPN. A full-IPN are characterized by the presence of crosslinks
in both network polymers, a semi-IPN exists when one of the components is crosslinked, another
is linear. The various techniques for preparing IPN can be distributed into sequential
polymerization (SIPN) and simultaneous polymerization (SIN). SIPN are obtained by swelling a
polymer network I with a monomer mixture II, which is polymerized in-situ. SIN polymerization
is obtained by mixing all monomers or prepolymers and the curing agents together before either
polymer is formed. Among the three modes of synthesis, the SIN is generally the best one to have

humidity was maintained at 50% for at least 2 days before they were tested.

4. Results and Discussion
4.1 Synthesis of blocked PU/epoxy IPN
The reaction mechanism can be described by FTIR analysis. The FTIR spectroscopy
analysis is based on the peak change of functional groups during the reaction period. Fig.1 shows
FTIR spectra of blocked NCO-terminated PU with chain extender (4,4-methylene diamine) at
various reaction times and at a temperature of 145℃. The spectrum of Fig.1(a) shows no
absorption peak at 2270 cm-1 corresponding to the isocyanate (NCO) when the reaction started,
owing to the NCO-terminated PU prepolymer blocked by blocking agent (-caprolactam). After
reaction for 3 min at 145℃ as shown in Fig.1(b), the absorption peak intensity of NCO at 2270
cm-1 appeared obviously, and the absorption peak of －NHCOE－ at 3550-3650 cm-1
disappeared. From the spectrum in Fig.1(c), one can observed that the absorption peak intensity
at 2270 cm-1 (NCO) disappeared obviously after reaction for 2 hr at 145℃. The resulting
absorption spectra indicated that the majority of the free isocyanate (NCO) groups were
generated at elevated temperature, and then, the free NCO groups could easily be reacted with
chain extender (4,4-methylene diamine). Therefore, the reaction process is almost completed in
the second hour.
Fig.2 illustrates that the FTIR spectra of epoxy mixed with one equivalent of curing agent
(4,4-methylene diamine) at (a) t=0; (b) t=2 hr and a temperature of 145℃. From Fig.2, one can
observe that the absorption peak intensity of epoxy group at 915 cm-1 of epoxy at t=2 hr decrease
compared with the corresponding peak of the epoxy at t=0 hr during the reaction. Therefore, the
reaction process is almost complete in two hours at 145℃.
Fig.3 shows the FTIR spectra of the reaction system of blocked PU and epoxy at various
reaction times of 145℃. From the figure, there was no absorption peak intensity of NCO at 2270
cm-1 and having absorption peak intensity of epoxy group at 915 cm-1 when the reaction started.
After heating at 145℃ for 3 min, the absorption peak of NCO at 2270 cm-1 appeared, meanwhile,
the absorption peak of epoxy group at 915 cm-1 disappeared slightly. After heating at 145℃ for 2
hr, about 90% of the absorption peak of NCO at 2270 cm-1 and epoxy group at 915 cm-1
disappeared during the same time. From the above FTIR spectrum analysis, it was found that the
major reactions in the blocked PU/epoxy system are the self-polymerization of blocked PU/chain
extender and the self-polymerization of epoxy/curing agent. Meanwhile, the copolymerization
may have occurred at the same time.
4.2 Static mechanical properties
Figs. 4 and 5 illustrated the tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus and flexural
5Fig.11 showed the scanning electron micrographs of fracture surface of the blocked
PU/epoxy IPN at various blocked PU contents. From the figure (a), the pure epoxy expressed the
smooth and glossy microstructure due to it was brittle materials. From the figure (e), the blocked
PU exhibited the rough microstructure because it was flexible materials. From the figure (b) to
(d), when the blocked PU content increased, the microstructure of IPN became rougher.
5. Conclusion
1. From FTIR spectrum analysis, it was found that the major reactions in the blocked PU/epoxy
IPN system are the self-polymerization of blocked PU/chain extender (4,4-methylene diamine)
and the self-polymerization of epoxy/curing agent (4,4-methylene diamine). Meanwhile, from
reaction mechanisms that the copolymerization of IPN may have occurred at the same time.
2. The tensile strength, flexural strength, tensile modulus, flexural modulus and hardness of IPN
decreased with increasing of blocked PU content. The impact strength of IPN increased with
increasing of blocked PU content.
3. The damping mechanical properties of IPN were studied by the dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) method. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of IPN were shifted inwardly compared
with pure blocked PU and epoxy, which indicated that the blocked PU/epoxy IPN showed
excellent compatible.The dynamic storage modulus (E’) versus temperatures of IPN increased 
with increasing of epoxy content.
4. The weight loss by thermogravimetric analysis of blocked PU/epoxy IPN decreased with
increasing epoxy and filler content. There is an interpenetrating effect existing in the blocked
PU/epoxy IPN.
5. It was confirmed from scanning electron micrography (SEM) that when the blocked PU
content increased, the microstructure of IPN became rougher.
