total particle number levels, particularly in the 
size range of 56-180 nm. According to measurement 
results, most BC in aerosols in urban areas can be in 
the ultrafine size range.

一、前言 
    黑碳(BC)為氣膠的重要組成之一，在大氣中黑碳會吸收可見光太陽輻射且被確認為全球
暖化的主要影響因素之一(Schulz et al. 2006; Jacobson 2010)。黑碳的輻射強度大約 0.9 Wm-2 ，
是二氧化碳輻射強度的 55 %，且其輻射強度也高於其他溫室氣體，如甲烷，氟氯碳化物，氧
化亞氮和對流層的臭氧(Ramanathan 和 Feng 2009)。因此，藉由黑碳對大氣的熱效應可能是
導致全球暖化的一個主要貢獻者。另外，黑碳也引會起一些呼吸系統疾病並且對心血管系統
造成危害(Suglia et al. 2008; Power et al. 2011)。因此，基於各種因素，黑碳是一個值得探討的
議題，其中之一的因素為黑碳在人口密集地區會導致環境的危害和健康的影響。此外，都會
區環境中超過 80％的懸浮微粒為超細微粒 (Hussein et al. 2005)。在都會區環境中這些超細微
粒源自於交通的排放且其濃度範圍約為 1.0×104–2.0×104 particles cm−3 (Rodríguez et al., 2007; 
Beckerman et al., 2008; Hagler et al., 2009)。 
Boogaard et al. (2011)指出都會區臨近交通要道的黑碳質量濃度介於 2.1–4.4 μg m-3，約為
都會區背景值的 1.9 倍，環境中黑碳質量濃度約為 PM2.5 的 13.6–23.0 %。同時 NO2 濃度、超
細微粒數目濃度與黑碳質量濃度在交通要道與都會區背景值的比值相似，隱含著 NO2、超細
微粒與黑碳均來自於交通工具的排放。因此，研究都會區黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度在不同粒
徑範圍的關係是值得的。 
二、研究目的 
    由於近來的學術研究發現黑碳可能是都會區環境暖化的重要因素之一，因此對於都會區
環境中黑碳的質量濃度分佈狀況有進一步探討的必要性。國內對於探討大氣環境中黑碳的質
量濃度分佈尚屬匱乏，除了環保署南、北超級測站有針對黑碳質量濃度作長期監測外，並未
有任何學術研究針對都會區主要交通源進行黑碳質量濃度分佈特性探討。鑑於都會區的黑碳
與超細微粒均主要來自於交通工具的排放，因此，對於黑碳與超細微粒兩者之間的相關性亦
值得深入探討。因此，本研究在台北都會區主要幹道使用 Aethalometer 和掃描移動粒徑儀
（SMPS）同時測量黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度。藉由實地的採樣，測量結果可以提供更完整的
微粒數目粒徑分布的特徵，並且了解黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度在不同粒徑範圍的關係。 
三、文獻探討 
 在都會環境中，黑碳微粒通常為化石燃料不完全燃燒所產生且主要來自交通的排放。因
此，在都會區中交通運輸已被證實為區域性黑碳排放的主要貢獻者(Pérez et al. 2010; 
Boogaard et al. 2011; Invernizzi et al. 2011)。Pérez et al. (2010) 證實在西班牙巴塞隆納都會區
黑碳的濃度水準約為 3.6 μg m−3 且請楚地指出黑碳濃度的變動受到交通排放源的影響。
Snyder et al. (2010) 指出在美國兩個中西部城市，底特律(MI)和克利夫蘭(OH)，黑碳濃度分
別約為 0.2–0.8 及 0.6–2.7μg m−3。這些黑碳濃度通常和交通流量有正相關性，特別是在早晨
尖峰時段。Reche et al (2011)指出在六個歐洲城市的都會交通區與背景地區的黑碳濃度分別
為 3.5–7.8 and 0.7–1.9 μg m−3。Boogaard et al. (2011)指出在荷蘭五個城市的主要街道上，黑碳
濃度約為 2.1-4.4 μg m−3，此濃度相較於都會區背景值高約 1.5-2.2 倍。此外，Ramachandran 和 
Kedia (2010)指出在印度艾哈邁達巴德都會區的黑碳濃度分佈範圍從夏季的 2 μg m−3 至冬季
及梅雨季節前的 11 μg m−3。在艾哈邁達巴德的黑碳濃度水準是由當地的排放源和氣象條件
所主宰。 
    超細微粒通常可藉由燃燒、成核、氣體-微粒反應或蒸發/凝結等程序形成，在都會區環
境中的微粒有 80 %屬於超細微粒範疇(Hussein et al., 2005)，而其主要來源為交通工具。根據
 1
濃度(N6–225)和溫度則有些微的正相關性(Rpearson=0.254 for BC, p<0.001; Rpearson=0.260 for N6–225, 
p<0.001)。此外，黑碳濃度及微粒數目濃度(N6–225)與相對濕度則呈現負相關性(Rpearson=-0.418 
for BC, p<0.001; Rpearson=-0.369 for N6–225, p<0.001)。測量結果顯示風速對黑碳濃度和微粒數目
濃度的影響與Charron 和 Harrison(2003); Hussein et al. (2005) 和 Rodríguez et al. (2008)的結
果有所差異，Charron 和 Harrison(2003); Hussein et al. (2005) 和 Rodríguez et al.(2008)曾指出
黑碳濃度(或微粒數目濃度)會隨著風速的增加而下降。其可能的原因為本研究中的採樣位置
不是在排放源的上風處或下風處，而是被排放源所圍繞（幾個主要幹道和高架快速道路）。黑
碳和微粒可能排放或傳輸來自於不同方向的交通源。因此，在此採樣點的黑碳和微粒藉由風
的大氣稀釋並不顯著。 
5.2 都會區黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度(N6–225)水準  
 圖2(a)、(b)為採樣期間時平均黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度(N6–225)的變動情形。測量結果顯
示黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度(N6–225)在平日早上(7:00–9:00)和傍晚(16:00–18:00)的尖鋒時段有
顯著的峰值。此外，較低的黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度則發生在清晨時段。時平均黑碳濃度和
微粒數目濃度的日變動趨勢與都會區典型的日交通流量變動相似。在白天時段的黑碳濃度和
微粒數目濃度分別較清晨時段高約2.5和2.6倍。本研究中所測得的黑碳濃度與Fruin et al. 
(2008); Pérez et al. (2010); Boogaard et al. (2011)等人在都會交通區所測得的濃度水準相似。
Pérez et al. 在西班牙巴塞羅納所測得的黑碳濃度約為3.6 μg m−3 ，其濃度的變動顯然受到交通
排放源的影響。 Boogaard et al. 指出在五個荷蘭城市主要交通幹道上的黑碳濃度約為 2.1–4.4 
μg m−3，比城市背景地區高約1.5–2.2倍。 
5.3 微粒數目粒徑分佈 
 圖3表示都會區街道旁的平均微粒數目濃度粒徑分佈。此粒徑分佈範圍介於6–225 nm，為
超過3,100次SMPS掃描結果的平均值。所測得的微粒數目粒徑分佈則使用DistFit軟體模擬
(Chimera Tech., Inc., Forest Lake,MN, USA)。模擬結果顯示，此雙峰模式的粒徑分布可由兩個
對數常態分佈準確模擬。模擬結果隱含這個雙峰的粒徑分佈是由兩個獨立的對數常態分佈所
結合，即使<6 nm的微粒粒徑已超出SMPS的測量範圍。測量結果顯示在微粒粒徑<8 nm時，
微粒數目濃度會隨著微粒粒徑的減小而增加。在本研究中此大量的超細微粒可能來自於交通
所排放的新鮮煙霧。這些微粒，幾奈米大小的尺寸，已超出SMPS能偵測的極限。另外，測量
結果顯示白天時段的微粒眾數直徑顯著較清晨時段的微粒眾數直徑小。基於觀察結果，和白
天時段的微粒相比較下，清晨時段的微粒存在著較大的眾數直徑，其可能的原因為微粒在清
晨時段的低溫及高濕條件下進行凝結及膠結所造成。本研究中所測得的微粒眾數直徑較
Rodríguez et al. (2007)在義大利米蘭、西班牙巴塞隆納及英國倫敦等三個都會區所測得的微粒
眾數直徑來的大些。Rodríguez et al. (2007)在都會區所測得的時平均微粒數目眾數直徑約為
36–38 nm。 
5.4 都會區黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度的關係 
截至目前為止，關於黑碳濃度和微粒數目濃度兩者之間相關性的資訊很少。Rodríguez et al. 
(2008) and Reche et al. (2011)指出都會區的黑碳濃度與總微粒數目濃度存在著正相關性(微粒
尺寸範圍為 3–1,000 nm)。在採樣位置所測得 N6–18、N18–32、N32–56、N56–100、N100–180 和 N180–225
的微粒數目分率分別為 17.80、 20.17、25.17、21.37、12.61 和 2.88 %。測量結果顯示微粒平
均數目濃度在所選的六個微粒粒徑範圍中，微粒的主要粒徑為 32–56 nm。此外，在此採樣位
置的測量結果顯示時平均黑碳濃度與 N56–100 和 N100–180 的數目濃度有顯著的正相關性(all

urban traffic areas were significantly higher than those
in urban background sites, indicating that BC was ele-
vated due to traffic emission (Reche et al. 2011; Boogaard
et al. 2011). Reche et al. (2011) reported that BC levels
at urban traffic and background areas in six European
cities were 3.5–7.8 and 0.7–1.9 μg m−3, respectively.
Boogaard et al. (2011) showed that BC levels on major
streets in five cities in The Netherlands were 2.1–
4.4 μg m−3, approximately 1.5–2.2 times higher than
those in the urban background. Hyvärinen et al. (2011)
reported that BC levels at five background locations in
Finland were <0.5 μg m−3. Compared with measure-
ment results obtained by Viidanoja et al. (2002), who
measured BC levels in Helsinki, Finland, BC levels in
urban Helsinki were 0.3–5.7 μg m−3, significantly higher than
those in background locations. Moreover, Ramachandran and
Kedia (2010) demonstrated that BC levels in Ahmedabad,
India, an urban location, ranged from 2 μg m−3 during sum-
mer to 11 μg m−3 during winter and the post-monsoon sea-
sons. The BC levels in Ahmedabad were governed by local
sources and meteorology.
Additionally, over 80 % of airborne particles in urban
air are ultrafine (Shi et al. 2001; Hussein et al. 2005).
These ultrafine particles in urban areas originate from
traffic emissions and are in the range of 1.0×104–2.0×104
particles cm−3 (Hussein et al. 2004; Matson 2005; Rodríguez
et al. 2007; Beckerman et al. 2008; Morawska et al. 2008;
Hagler et al. 2009). Moreover, Westerdahl et al. (2005);
Rodríguez et al. (2008), and Reche et al. (2011) had
demonstrated that BC levels are positively correlated with
total particle number levels in urban areas. However,
information for the relationship between BC and parti-
cle number levels in urban areas is limited. Therefore,
investigating the relationship between BC and particle
number levels in different particle size ranges at an
urban area is worthwhile. Accordingly, this investiga-
tion used an aethalometer and scanning mobility parti-
cle sizer (SMPS) to measure the levels of BC and
particle number simultaneously at an urban roadside in
Taipei City. The measurement results could provide a
more complete presentation of size-fractionated particle
number characteristics via field sampling and examine
the relationship of BC levels with particle number
levels in different particle size ranges.
Methods
The primary local source of atmospheric particulate
matter in urban Taipei City is traffic. The sampling site
(25°02′43″ N, 121°31′57″ E) in this study is selected on
an urban roadside close to the intersection of Civic
Blvd. and Xinsheng S. Rd. (Fig. 1). Moreover, three
elevated expressways (i.e., the Civic Expressway, Xinsheng
Expressway, and Jianguo Expressway) are adjacent to this
sampling site. Among these three expressways, the Civic
and Jianguo expressways are east–west and north–south arte-
rial roads, respectively, and are linked to Taipei’s road
network.
The BC levels in fine particulate matter were mea-
sured with an aethalometer (Magee Model AE31; Magee
Scientific, Berkeley, CA, USA). The inlet of the aethal-
ometer was conducted with a PM2.5 cyclone (BGI Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA) to sample airborne particulate matter
≤2.5 μm in diameter at a sampling flow rate of 5 Lmin−1.
Additionally, a SMPS (TSI Model 3936; TSI, Inc., Shore-
view, MN, USA) was used to measure particle number
size distributions. The two primary components of the TSI
Model 3936 SMPS are a TSI Model 3080 Electrostatic
Classifier which includes a TSI Model 3081 Differential
Mobility Analyzer and a TSI Model 3022A Condensation
Particle Counter. In this study, the SMPS measured levels
of particles 6–225 nm in diameter. The SMPS was oper-
ated at a sheath-to-sample flow ratio of 10:1. Sample flow
rate was set at 1.5 Lmin−1. Each scan comprised an
SMPS up-scan of 120 s, a retrace scan of 30 s, and
standby of 150 s. The instruments were set up close to
the road and at a 15-m distance from a six-floor business
building. Inlets of the aethalometer and SMPS were locat-
ed roughly 2 m above ground level. The aethalometer and
SMPS were operated continuously from September 7–11
(Wednesday to Sunday) to September 21–26 (Wednesday
to Monday), 2011. The sampling results could demonstrate
the typical variations of BC and particle number levels
over a week’s period, including seven workdays and four
holidays, at this urban area. The logging interval for all
measurements was set at 5 min. Local meteorological
data were recorded at 1-min intervals by a Vantage Pro
2TM Weather Station (Davis Instruments, Hayward, CA,
USA) set up close to sampling instruments. Wind speed and
direction were measured at 4 m above the ground.
The hourly average particle number (N6–225) concen-
trations within the size range of 6–225 nm were calcu-
lated from SMPS raw data. Furthermore, the levels of
particle number in different size ranges were also deter-
mined from SMPS raw data. Additionally, measured
number size distributions were fitted with DistFit soft-
ware (Chimera Tech., Inc., Forest Lake, MN, USA).
The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient
(RPearson) was applied to determine the strength of cor-
relations between different pollutants or relationships
between pollutants and meteorological conditions at the
sampling site. An independent sample t-test was applied to
test differences in BC (or particle number) levels between
different monitoring periods (daytime and early morning
hours). Significance was 0.05 for all statistical tests.
Environ Sci Pollut Res
Moreover, measurement results for effect of wind speed on
BC and particle number levels differed from that obtained by
Charron and Harrison (2003); Hussein et al. (2005), and
Rodríguez et al. (2008), who demonstrated that BC levels
(or particle number levels) decreased as wind speed increased.
One possible reason is that the sampling location in this study
was not at downwind or upwind of the emission sources, and
it was surrounded by several emission sources (several major
roads and expressways). The BC and particles could be emit-
ted and/or transferred from these traffic sources in different
directions. Therefore, atmospheric dilution of BC and par-
ticles by wind was insignificant at this sampling site.
Levels of BC and N6–225 at an urban area
Figure 3a, b presents diurnal variations in hourly average
BC and N6–225 levels during the sampling periods. Measure-
ment results indicate that BC and N6–225 levels peaked
during morning (7:00–9:00) and evening (16:00–18:00)
rush hours on weekdays. Additionally, low BC and N6–225
levels existed in the early morning hours. Additionally, the
diurnal variations in hourly average BC and N6–225 levels
were similar to the typical daily traffic patterns in urban
areas. Table 2 presents the hourly average levels of BC and
N6–225 throughout the sampling periods. Levels of BC and
N6–225 during daytime were significantly higher, approxi-
mately 2.5 and 2.6 times than those in the early morning
hours, respectively (all p<0.001).
Table 3 summarizes the previous studies of BC and
particle number levels in urban cities worldwide. The levels
of BC in this study were similar to those obtained by Fruin
et al. (2008); Pérez et al. (2010); Boogaard et al. (2011), and
Invernizzi et al. (2011), who measured BC levels in urban
traffic areas. Pérez et al. (2010) demonstrated that levels of
BC were approximately 3.6 μg m−3, and their variability
was clearly influenced by road traffic emissions in Barcelona,

the range of 6–225 nm, which was obtained by averaging data
from >3,100 SMPS scans. The measured size distribution was
fitted with DistFit software (Chimera Tech., Inc., Forest Lake,
MN, USA). Table 4 lists mode diameters and geometric
standard deviations of number size distribution at the sam-
pling site. The fitting result shows that a bi-modal number size
distribution pattern can be simulated accurately by two log-
normal models. The simulation indicates that this bi-modal
size distribution was combined with two individual log-
normal size distributions, even though particles <6 nm were
outside the SMPS measurement range. Measurement results
show that particle number concentrations increased as particle
diameters decreased to <8 nm (Fig. 4). The large amounts of
ultrafine particles in this study can be attributed to fresh fumes
emitted from traffic. These particles, a few nanometers in size,
were under the lower detection limit of the SMPS of only
6 nm. Additionally, measurement results show that the mode
diameter of particles during daytime was significantly smaller

Conclusions
The levels of BC and particle number in a Taipei urban area
are similar to those measured in previous studies in other
urban traffic environments. Time variations in BC levels are
the same as those of N6–225 levels in this study, clearly
indicating that BC and ultrafine particles can be from the
same emission source, which could be traffic. In spite of the
traffic volumes not having been observed in this study, some
previous studies had revealed that BC (or particle number)
levels in urban areas were significantly associated with
traffic volumes. Moreover, BC levels in the urban area are
more strongly associated with ultrafine particle levels than
with total particle number levels, particularly in the size
range of 56–180 nm. Therefore, the mass fraction of BC in
ultrafine particles is an interesting issue for comparing with
those in fine particulate matter in further investigations to
demonstrate that most BC in fresh aerosols in urban areas is
in the ultrafine size range.

四、論文摘要 
   Currently, over 1.4 million commuters travel on the Taipei metro system each day. Commuters 
spend considerable time, in some cases up to 1–2 h a day, traveling in metro trains. However, few 
studies have compared air quality between trains traveling above-ground and underground. This 
study measures the PM10, PM2.5, UFP and CO2 levels inside metro trains traveling in underground 
tunnels and on elevated tracks on a metro line in the Taipei metro system from November to 
December, 2007 and from September to October, 2010. Measurement results demonstrate that PM10, 
PM2.5 and CO2 levels inside metro trains traveling in underground environments were higher than 
those in above-ground environments approximately 1.2–1.4 times. However, UFP levels inside 
metro trains traveling in underground environments were lower than those in above-ground 
environments approximately 0.8 times. These measurement results reveal that levels of pollutant 
species inside the metro trains were significantly affected by traveling environmental conditions. 
Additionally, measurement results show that levels of PM10, PM2.5 and UFP inside metro trains 
were lower than those in outdoor air, but levels of CO2 inside metro trains were significantly higher 
than those in outdoor air. These measurement results indicate that low PM levels inside metro trains 
are likely due to the filtered out of PM by the train ventilation system effectively. The measurement 
results also confirm a significant positive relationship between commuter number and CO2 levels 
inside the metro trains. Clearly, CO2 exhaled by commuters could accumulate inside metro trains 
and, compared to PM, is not as easily removed by the ventilation system when air circulation does 
not provide enough fresh air in the metro trains, particularly in trains traveling in underground 
environments.

Experimental Methods 
 
Currently, over 1.4 million commuters travel on the Taipei metro network each day. In this study, 
two routes were selected as subjects on a high-capacity metro line. On these two selected routes, 
trains travel in underground tunnels between the Taipei main (T) station and the Minquan W. Rd. 
(M) station (R1; approximately 1.73 km) and travel on elevated tracks between the Minquan W. 
Rd. (M) station and the Jiantan (J) station (R2; approximately 2.54 km). A train running on this 
high-capacity line links six electric–powered passenger cars. In this study, the monitoring 
location was the third or fourth passenger car of the metro trains. 
 
A Grimm Series 1.108 OPC (Grimm Tech., Inc., Douglasville, GA, USA) was used to measure the 
levels of the PM10, PM2.5 on the metro trains. At the same time, a TSI Model 3007 CPC (TSI Inc., 
Shoreview, MN, USA) was used to measure UFP levels, and a TSI Model 7565 Q-Trak (TSI Inc., 
Shoreview, MN, USA) was used to measure CO2 levels.  
 
The PM10, PM2.5, UFP, and CO2 levels inside the metro trains were measured by a subject 
carrying monitors in a backpack. The measurements were taken between 06:00 and 24:00 on 
weekdays and weekends from November to December, 2007 and from September to October, 
2010. The outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 levels measured by the ambient air-quality monitoring station 
at Zhongshan station are considered the corresponding PM10 and PM2.5 levels in the urban 
atmosphere in Taipei. During the sampling periods, outdoor temperature was 12–33 oC (mean= 
22 oC) and 18–35 oC (mean= 28 oC) in 2007 and 2010, respectively. Relative humidity was 
48–92% (mean= 72%) and 51–89% (mean= 71%) in 2007 and 2010, respectively.  
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Table 1 presents the PM10, PM2.5, UFP, and CO2 levels inside metro trains on selected routes. 
Measurement results show that the PM10 and PM2.5 levels inside the metro trains on R1 (in 
underground tunnels) were significantly higher than those on R2 (on elevated tracks) (all 
p≤0.019). Additionally, PM10 and PM2.5 levels inside metro trains during Nov.–Dec., 2007 were 
significantly higher than those during Sep.–Oct., 2010 approximately 1.5 and 1.2 times, 
respectively (all p<0.001). 
 
Fang and Chang8 and Chang et al.9 demonstrated that atmospheric PM10 and PM2.5 levels in 
winter season were significantly higher than those in autumn season approximately 1.2–1.3 times 
in the Taipei metropolitan area. Moreover, the atmospheric PM10 and PM2.5 levels measured at 
 4
approximately 3.7×104 particles cm-3 at outdoor of the metro stations in the Taipei metro system. 
In contrast with the measurement results of Cheng and Yan6 this study found that UFP levels 
inside metro trains were lower than those in outdoor air approximately 0.3 times, particularly in 
trains traveling in underground environments.  
 
The CO2 levels inside the metro trains were approximately 1200 ppm in the Taipei metro system. 
The CO2 levels inside the metro trains on R1 were significantly higher than those on R2 
approximately 1.2 times (p=0.013). During the sampling period, the mean CO2 levels in outdoor 
environments were approximately 450 ppm. The CO2 levels inside the metro trains were 
approximately 2.7 times higher than those in outdoor environments. Regardless of whether it is 
measured on R1 or R2, CO2 levels inside metro trains exceeded the limits proposed by the Taiwan 
EPA (an average of 1000 ppm of 8 h) in December, 2005, indicating that CO2 levels had 
accumulated inside the metro trains due to poor ventilation. High CO2 levels have also been 
measured in other metro systems. For example, Park and Ha10 reported CO2 levels of 1800 ppm 
inside Seoul subway trains, and Kam et al.5 reported CO2 levels as high as 1200 ppm inside Los 
Angeles Metro trains, which was 3–4 times higher than ambient CO2 levels.  
 
It is interesting to note that the highest PM10, PM2.5 and CO2 levels inside the metro trains were 
observed on R1 when trains traveling from T station to M station and the lowest PM10, PM2.5 and 
CO2 levels inside the metro trains were observed on R2 while trains traveling from J station to M 
station. However, the highest UFP levels inside the metro trains were observed on R2 trains 
traveling from J station to M station and that the lowest UFP levels were observed inside R1 
trains traveling from T station to M station. These measurement results indicate that levels of 
pollutants inside the metro trains were significantly affected by environmental conditions around 
the trains. For example, PM10 and PM2.5 levels inside the metro trains on R2 traveling from M 
station to J station were higher than those in the opposite direction because trains which travels 
from underground environments have higher PM10 and PM2.5 levels compared to trains which 
travels from above-ground environments. Similar results were observed on R1. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Measurement results demonstrate that PM10, PM2.5 and CO2 levels inside metro trains in 
underground environments were higher than those in above-ground environments approximately 
1.2–1.4 times. The UFP levels inside metro trains in underground environments were lower than 
those in above-ground environments approximately 0.8 times. These measurement results reveal 
that levels of pollutant species inside the metro trains were significantly influenced by the
