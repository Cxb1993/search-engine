Abstract 
 
This paper presents a time-invariant feedback controller that simultaneously regulates the ZMP 
(zero-moment point) position and the joint configuration of a 3D biped in order to achieve an 
asymptotically, periodic walking gait for a 3D bipedal robot with feet. The cyclic walking gait is composed 
of a successive single support phase and an impulsive impact with full plane-contact between the feet and 
the ground. The biped robot has 10 DOFs (degrees of freedom) in the single-support phase and 10 
actuators. In order to avoid the unexpected rotation of the supporting foot, the position of the ZMP in the 
horizontal plane has to be controlled. It is also desired that the feedback controller tracks a parameterized 
reference trajectory to achieve walking stability. We use the method of virtual constraints previously 
implemented for controlling point-feet bipedal robots to create a set of parameterized reference walking 
trajectories. By creating the hybrid zero dynamics, an orbital stability study with Poincaré map is evaluated 
in a reduced space. We then design a supplemental event-based feedback controller to enhance walking 
stability. The walking gait has an average walking speed of 0.76m/sec (or 0.72 body lengths per second) in 
the simulation study.

Let the joint coordinate in the single-support phase be [ ]Tqqqq 1021 L= . The following assumptions are 
made in this work. 
(1) Each link is represented by a point mass located at its center of mass. 
(2) Walking consists of two alternating motion phases: the single support phase and the double support phase. 
(3) The double support phase is instantaneous and involves the flat-foot impact of the swing leg with the 
ground. 
(4) At impact, the swing leg neither slips nor rebounds. 
(5) The swing and stance legs exchange their roles at each impact. 
(6) Walking takes place on a flat surface.

Figure 1. Biped coordinate system when the left foot is the stance foot. 
 
Let the x-axis point forward, z-axis point upward, and the y-axis be determined by the right-hand rule. 
Figure 1 shows the coordinate system for the bipedal robot during the left foot stance and right foot stance. 
Table 1 lists the rotational axes for the biped during the left foot stance phase and the right foot stance phase. 
All joints’ rotational axes in the y-axis are in the same direction for both the left foot stance and right foot 
stance phases, and all joints’ rotational axes in both x-axis and z-axis are different by 180 degrees. One unique 
feature of the above coordinate systems assignment is that for both the left foot stance and right foot stance 
phases the robot has the same set of dynamic equations in the joint variables q . Therefore, this coordinate 
system assignment makes the analysis and design of the biped walking motion less complicated.

During the impact, the biped’s joint variables do not change, but the extended generalized velocities 
undergo a jump. Analogously to [17], this yields

In summary, determining the desired ZMP evolution ))(),(( θθ zmpzmp yx  and )(θdh  is equivalent to the 
design of a feedback controller in the single support phase. In the next section we summarize how to 
determine choices for ))(),(( θθ zmpzmp yx  and )(θdh  that result in a periodic walking motion. 
 
4. Constrained optimization design for a periodic gait 
 
For simplicity, the desired evolution of the ZMP position ))(),(( θθ zmpzmp yx  is planned as a line segment 
connecting two desired ZMP points, ),( szmp

zmp yx . The next objective is to determine choices 
for )(θdh  that are compatible with a periodic walking motion. This task can be largely simplified by 
enforcing the virtual constraints 0=y  (or )(θda hq = ), and it reduces the dimension of the biped’s 
dynamics to a 2-dimensional dynamic system.  
We obtain the 2-dimensional zero dynamics below. Let the reduced variable be ⎥⎦

The biped’s dynamics in the stance phase are now reduced to a 4-dimensional autonomous system, called the 
single-support swing phase zero dynamics, which can describe the behavior of the original system with 20 
 9
length defined in Step 4, and subject to all the constraints in Step 5.  
 
The above optimization problem can be solved in MATLAB with the FMINCON function of the 
optimization toolbox. A solution minimizing J  defines a desired periodic walking gait. Note that this 
optimization technique is only a local minimum, and thus the obtained periodic motion depends on the initial 
set of optimization parameters. Moreover, the obtained periodic walking gait may not be periodic stable, even 
though the evolution of the ZMP is within the stance foot. 
 
5. Stability analysis 
 
The stability of the searched periodic walking can be tested numerically using a linearized Poincaré map 
in a reduced low-dimensional space. Following the method used in Chevallereau et al. [17], it is shown that in 
ZS ∩  the state of the robot can be represented using only 3 independent variables [ ]Tz qqX θ&&11= , where

We now find a nominal periodic walking motion that minimizes the energy consumed per step. The 
search procedure is carried out in MATLAB with the FMINCON function of the optimization toolbox. We 
first generate the equations of motion for the 3D biped by using the functions of the symbolic toolbox, and 
then converting to C functions in order to shorten the simulation time.

of 2346.0=L m, and an average walking speed of 0.7582 m/sec (or 0.7221 body lengths per second). For the 
proposed biped walking control method, both the desired joint trajectories and the desired ZMP profile are 
controlled to satisfy the condition on the ZMP. During the walking, the stance foot remains flat on the ground 
and the swing foot keeps above the ground.

Poincaré map used to analyze the stability of the walking gait is in a 3-dimensional space.  
(3) We use a stride-to-stride controller to enhance the stability of a walking motion. The nominal hybrid 
controller consists of a time-invariant within-stride controller that creates a periodic walking motion, and a 
supplemental stride-to-stride (or event-based) controller that stabilizes the walking gait. The event-based 
feedback law automatically distributes small changes to all of the actuated joints in order to achieve a stable 
walking motion. 
 
There are several ways in which the results can be extended in the future. They include offering a turning 
control, adding a double-support phase to emulate human-like walking, and presenting other interesting 
motions etc.
