Abstract -- A modified inductor design with the 
layout of variable metal line width is adopted in 
this study to improve the quality factor (Q-factor) 
of spiral inductors in radio frequency integrated 
circuits (RFICs). In the modified design, the 
inner coils of a spiral are designed to have 
narrower line width to mitigate the loss caused 
by the eddy current, whereas the line width of the 
outer coils are broadened to reduce the ohmic 
loss. The Q-factor of an inductor can then be 
improved by reducing the metal loss. To facilitate 
this modified inductor design, a simple formula 
for calculating the metal resistance of a spiral 
inductor is first derived. By minimizing the 
resistance, an analytic formula for finding the 
proper line width of each coil can then be 
obtained. Several 0.13-µm CMOS spiral inductor 
are investigated to validate the proposed design 
formulas. Also, the obtained results are 
compared with the optimization solutions using 
genetic algorithm (GA) to demonstrate the 
capacity of the developed line-width design 
formulas.

1. INTRODUCTION 
With the rapid growth of the demand for 
low-power, low-cost, and high-integration wireless 
communication systems, the development of 
on-chip passive devices for Si-based radio 
frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) has emerged 
as a critical issue recently. Among the passive circuit 
designs, on-chip spiral inductors are particular 
important and widely used in RFICs such as mixers, 
low-noise amplifiers, and oscillators. There has been 
much research on the analysis and design of RFIC 
spiral inductors. One important issue concerned in 
the design of a spiral inductor is the improvement of 
the quality factor (Q-factor). It is well known that 
the Q-factor of a Si-based spiral inductor is mainly 
determined by three technology parameters, that is, 
(1) the resistive loss of the metal line, (2) the 
substrate loss of the silicon buck, and (3) the 
parasitic capacitance of the insulating oxide layers. 
By using advanced micromachining technologies, 
various novel spiral structures have been proposed 
to alleviate the loss of silicon substrate and the 
parasitic oxide capacitance [1]-[6]. In general, these 
designs can greatly improve the Q-factor of RFIC 
inductors, but they could be much expensive as 
compared with the designs using a standard silicon 
technology. Also, it may be difficult to reliably 
integrate these micromachined spiral inductors with 
other components and circuits.

Furthermore, since the eddy current flows through 
an effective area δT in the metal strip, the eddy 
current resistance ,eddy nR  can be written as

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
To validate the resistance calculation proposed in 
this work, that is, equations (6) and (7), two 3.5-turn 
spiral inductors with the outer diameters (OD) being 
150 and 200 µm have been fabricated and measured 
to perform the experimental verification. These 
inductors were implemented in the UMC 0.13-µm 
1P8M Mixed-Mode/RF CMOS process. The spirals 
with metal thickness being 2 µm were fabricated on 
the metal-8 layer, and the underpass was deposited 
on the metal-7 layer. The line width W and line 
spacing S are 6 and 2 µm, respectively. Also, the 
measured raw data are de-embedded with a two-step 
(open and short) procedure to remove the undesired 
pad parasitics. Figs. 2 and 3 compare the calculated 
and measured series resistance Rs (=Re[-1/Y12]) of 
the tested samples. In low frequency bands, Rs is 
mainly determined by the resistance of the metal 
line. The computed results using the developed 
equation thus fit accurately to the measurement data 
in low frequency ranges. However, the influence of 
the oxide and substrate parasitics on the series 
resistance would becomes significant at higher 
frequencies. The calculated results therefore 
gradually deviate from measured data as the 
increase of frequency.

Then the analytical formula for designing the proper 
metal line width is obtained by minimizing the 
series resistance. Several 0.13-µm CMOS spiral 
inductors have been investigated to test the 
proposed design technique. The results using 
0.13-µm CMOS technology have been tested to 
validate the proposed method. It has been found the 
results obtained by the proposed design formula are 
very closed to the measurements and optimized data, 
indicating the validation and capability of the 
developed design method.
