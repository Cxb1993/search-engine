1 Introduction
Consider a discrete-time nonlinear descriptor system
governed by difference-algebraic equations (DAE) of the
form
Ex(k+ 1) = F(x(k),w(k), u(k)),
z(k) = Z(x(k),w(k), u(k)),
y(k) = Y(x(k),w(k), u(k)),
(1)
where x ∈ Rn is the state, u ∈ Rm is the control input,
and w ∈ Rl is the disturbance signal which includes any
external inputs to be tracked as well as any unknown dis-
turbances to be rejected. In a standard H∞ control set-
ting, it is assumed that w has a finite `2 norm. The sig-
nal y ∈ Rp is the measured output, and z ∈ Rs is the
penalty output which may include tracking error and a
cost of the input u needed to achieve the prescribed con-
trol goals. We also assume that F(·, ·, ·), Z(·, ·, ·), and
Y(·, ·, ·) are smooth functions defined in a neighbour-
hood of the origin in Rn × Rl × Rm, all of appropri-
ate dimensions. Without loss of generality, we assume
that F(0, 0, 0) = 0, Z(0, 0, 0) = 0 and Y(0, 0, 0) = 0.
The matrix E ∈ Rn×n is assumed to be singular with
rankE = r < n. A large class of physical systems can
be modeled by this kind of DAEs. The paper of [7] gives
many practical examples -including circuit and system
design, robotics, neural network, etc.- and presents an ex-
cellent review on nonlinear DAEs. Many other applica-
tions of DAEs as well as numerical treatment –including
continuous-time and discrete-time systems– can be found
in [2]. In this report, we will consider both the cases
of state feedback and output feedback. Therefore, the
control action to (1) is to be provided by either a con-
troller described by a static state feedback law of the form
u(k) = K1(x(k)), where K1 : Rn → Rm is a smooth func-
tions with K1(0) = 0, or an output dynamic compensator
of the form
EKξ(k+ 1) = FK(ξ, y),
u = HK(ξ, y),
(2)
where ξ is defined on a neighbourhood Ξ of the ori-
gin in Rν and FK : Ξ × Rp → Rν, HK : Ξ × Rp →
Rm are smooth functions, satisfying FK(0, 0) = 0 and
HK(0, 0) = 0. Here EK ∈ Rν×ν is a constant matrix with
rankEK = rK ≤ ν.
The purpose of the control is two fold: to achieve in-
ternal stability with causality and to attenuate the influ-
ence of the exogeneous inputw on the penalty variable z.
The problem of local disturbance attenuation with inter-
nal stability for continuous-time and discrete-time non-
linear systems have been extensively studied in the litera-
ture [5, 6, 8, 9, 11]. In particular, [6] have presented a solu-
tion toH∞ control problem via state feedback and output
feedback for general discrete-time nonlinear systems. Re-
cently, [11] have derived state space formulae for a fam-
ily of H∞ controllers via output feedback as well as state
feedback. However, all of the above mentioned literature
consider only the conventional state space systems. Little
has been told about theH∞ control for nonlinear discrete-
time descriptor systems. In this report, we continue this
line of research to study theH∞ control problem for gen-
eral nonlinear discrete-time descriptor systems in which,
in contrast to [6], the measured output is, in general, a
function of the state, exogenous input as well as the con-
trol input. In this report, we derive state space formulae
for a family of H∞ controllers. Both the static state feed-
back and dynamic output feedback cases are considered.
We first derive various stability criteria for discrete-time
nonlinear descriptor systems, and a version of Bounded
Real Lemma is also obtained based on the concepts of dis-
sipation inequality and differential game. Then the re-
sult is used to derive theH∞ control theory for nonlinear
discrete-time descriptor systems. The approach taken is
mainly algebraic, hence is simple and clear.
2 Elements of Nonlinear Discrete-
Time Descriptor Systems
Consider the following nonlinear descriptor systems
Ex(k+ 1) = F(x(k),w(k)),
y(k) = Y(x(k),w(k)), (3)
where x ∈ Rn, w ∈ Rr, y ∈ Rm, E is a constant matrix
and F(0, 0) = 0. The constant matrix E ∈ Rn×n is, in
general, a singular matrix with rankE = r < n. Without
loss of generality, we can assume that E = diag{Ir×r, 0}
Before moving onto the next definition, we first review
some results concerning linear discrete-time descriptor
systems. Consider the following linear system:
Ex(k+ 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k), (4)
y(k) = Cx(k) (5)
where E, A,B,C are constant matrices having compatible
dimensions. Assume that {E, A} is regular. Then, with-
out loss of generality, we can transform equation (4) into
the following Weierstrass form.
x1(k+ 1) = A1x1(k) + B1u(k)
Nx2(k+ 1) = x2(k) + B2u(k)
where N is a nilpotent matrix. It is not difficult to see that
if the matrix N has nilpotent index greater than one, the
transfer function, T(z)
4
= C(zE − A)−1B, of the system
might be non-proper. If it is indeed the case, for discrete-
time systems this implies that (4)-(5) is non-causal. This
motivates the following definition.

h3) Any bounded trajectory of the system Ex(k + 1) =
F(x(k), 0) satisfying Y(x(k), 0) = 0 is such that
lim
k→∞
x(k) = 0.
h4) The DAE (3) is impulse observable (i.e.
{E, Fx(0, 0),Yx(0, 0)} is impulse observable).
Then (3) is internally stable with index one and L2-gain≤ γ.
Proof. Proof of the lemma follows the same lines of Re-
mark 2 about Theorem 2 in [6]. Consider a Hamiltonian
function of the form: H(x,w) := V(F(x,w))− V(Ex) +
1
2 (‖z‖2 − γ2‖w‖2). Taking the first- and second-order
partial derivatives with respect to w yields

By hypothesis h1), the Hessian matrix of H is negative
definite at (x0,w0) = (0, 0). Then, by the Implicit Func-
tion Theorem, there exist an open neighbourhood N of
x0 = 0 in Rn, an open neighbourhood M of w0 = 0 in
Rl , and a unique smooth function w∗(•) such that equa-
tion (11) has a unique solutionw = w∗(x). This amounts
to showing that the Hamiltonian function has the follow-
ing Taylor series expansion around w = w∗.
H(x,w) = H(x,w∗(x)) + 1

−w∗(x))T
(
∂2H
∂w2
(x,w∗(x))
)
(w−w∗(x)) +H.O.T., (13)
where H.O.T. stands for high order terms. Now, hy-
potheses h1) and h2) imply that H(x,w) has a local max-
imum at w = w∗ such that H(x,w∗(x)) = 0. Therefore,
there exists an open neighbourhood X0 of x = 0 and an
open neighbourhood W0 of w = 0 such that H(x,w) ≤
H(x,w∗(x)) = 0, for all x ∈ X0 and for all w ∈ W0.
The previous inequality can be equivalently rewritten as:
V(F(x,w)) − V(Ex) ≤ 12 (γ2‖w‖2 − ‖Y(x,w)‖2). This
shows that (3) has an L2-gain less than or equal to γ.
Moreover, by setting w = 0 in the above inequality and
utilizing Theorem 5, it can be seen that x = 0 is a locally
asymptotically stable equilibrium of the system (3). Fur-
thermore, the system is causal. This completes the proof.
Q.E.D.
3 H∞ Control via State Feedback
For a nonlinear discrete-time descriptor system Σ defined
by (1), the standard H∞ control problem consists of find-
ing, if possible, a controller Γ such that the resulting
closed-loop system (See Figure 1) has a locally asymp-
totically stable equilibrium point at the origin, is of index
one, and has anL2-gain (fromw to z) less than or equal to
γ. In the state feedback H∞ control problem we assume
that y = x in (1), i.e., that the whole state is available for
measurement. To state the main results of this section,
we first introduce some notations. Define the following
constant matrices.

We are now ready to state the main result of this section.
Theorem 6. Consider the nonlinear discrete-time descriptor
system (1) with y = x. Suppose that there exists a Ck (k ≥ 0)
positive definite function V(x), locally defined in a neighbour-
hood of x = 0 in Rn, such that
A1) D11 < 0, D22 > 0.
A2) The discrete-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Issacs equation
Y1(x) = V(F(x,w∗(x), u∗(x))−V(Ex)
+
1
2
(‖Z(x,w∗(x), u∗(x))‖2 − γ2‖w∗(x)‖2) = 0 (14)
3
[6] again, we have (note that in this case we shall use
r22(x) > 0)
H(x,w∗(x), u) ≥ H(x,w∗(x), u∗(x)),
∀x ∈ X1, ∀w ∈ W1. (19)
where X1 andW1 are some neighborhoods of x = 0 and
w = 0, respectively. Equations (18) and (19) amount
to showing that (w∗(x), u∗(x)) is a local saddle point of
H(x,w, u). It is concluded from (18) and hypothesis A2)
that H(x,w, u∗(x)) ≤ 0, for all x ∈ X0 and for allw ∈ W0,
or equivalently,
V(F(x,w, u∗(x)))−V(Ex)
≤ −1
2
(
‖Z(x,w, u∗(x))‖2 − γ2‖w‖2
)
,
∀x ∈ X0, ∀w ∈ W0. (20)
This shows that the closed-loop system, after applying
the static state feedback law u = u∗(x), has an L2 gain
less than or equal to a prescribed positive number γ. By
letting w = 0 in the last inequality, we have
V(F(x, 0, u∗(x)))−V(Ex)
≤ −1
2
ZT(x, 0, u∗(x))Z(x, 0, u∗(x)).
This together with hypothesisA4) proves that the equilib-
rium point x = 0 of the closed-loop system is stable and
causal. To prove asymptotic stability, consider any trajec-
tory x(k) of the system Ex(k+ 1) = F(x, 0, u∗(x)) yield-
ing V(F(x, 0, u∗(x)))−V(Ex) = 0 for all k ≥ 0. Then, the
previous inequality implies that Z(x(k), 0, u∗(x)) = 0,
for all k ≥ 0. From hypothesis A3), we conclude that
limk→∞ x(k) = 0. By Theorem 3, it is concluded that
x = 0 is locally an asymptotically stable equilibriumwith
index one. Q.E.D.
Remark. Assumption A3) can be thought of as a gen-
eralization of the zero-state detectability to the nonlinear
descriptor system’s case.
4 H∞ Control via Dynamic Output
Feedback
In this section, we shall turn our attention to the problem
of local disturbance attenuation via dynamic measure-
ment feedback, with internal stability, for general non-
linear discrete-time descriptor systems of the form (1).
The control action to (1) is to be provided by a controller,
which possesses the measured variable y and generates
the appropriate control input u, and is modeled by a set
of DAEs of the form
EKξ(k+ 1) = FK(ξ, y),
u = HK(ξ, y),
(21)
where ξ is defined on a neighbourhood Ξ of the ori-
gin in Rν and FK : Ξ × Rp → Rν, HK : Ξ × Rp →
Rm are smooth functions, satisfying FK(0, 0) = 0 and
HK(0, 0) = 0. Here EK ∈ Rν×ν is a constant matrix with
rankEK = rK ≤ ν. For the output feedback case, we have
firstly the following result.
Lemma 7. Consider (1) and suppose assumptionsA1) toA4)
hold. Consider the following output feedback controller
Eξ(k+ 1) = F(ξ(k),w∗(ξ(k)), u∗(ξ(k)))
+G(ξ(k))(y(k)
−Y(ξ(k),w∗(ξ(k)), u∗(ξ(k)))),
u(k) = u∗(ξ(k)), (22)
where ξ ∈ Ξ ⊂ Rn is defined on some neighbourhood of the
origin,w∗, u∗ is defined as in the proof of Theorem 6, and G(·)
is the output injection gain. Set xe = col(x, ξ), and set
R(x) =
[
(1− ε1)r11(x) r12(x)
r21(x) (1+ ε2)r22(x)
]
where 0 < ε1 < 1 and ε2 > 0 are arbitrary real numbers;
and let Ee = diag{E, EK}. Suppose that there exists a smooth,
real-valued function M(xe), locally defined in a neighbourhood
of xe = 0, vanishing at xe = col(0, 0) and positive elsewhere,
which satisfies the following hypotheses.

where
Fe(xe,w) =

,
with
Fˆ(xe,w) = F(ξ,w∗(ξ), u∗(ξ))
+G(ξ)(Y(x,w, u∗(ξ))− Y(ξ,w∗(ξ), u∗(ξ))).

−2(u∗)T(x)r21(x) = 0. (26)
Then the H∞ output feedback control problem for nonlinear
discrete-time descriptor systems is solved by the output feed-
back (22).
Proof. Similar to the proof of Lemma 7, it can be shown
that there exists a unique solutionw = wˆ(x) to (26) by the
Implicit Function Theorem. To prove the present propo-
sition, it suffices to prove that M(xe)
4
= Q(x − ξ) will
satisfy H1) if H3) holds. It is straightforward to show
that, if we let M(xe) = Q(x − ξ), then (25) implies (23).
Clearly, M(xe)
4
= Q(x− ξ) vanishes at xe = col(x, x) and
is positive elsewhere. It remains to prove that Y2(xe) van-
ishes at xe = col(x, x) and is negative elsewhere. To this
end, set e := x − ξ and S2(e, ξ) := Y2(xe)|x=e+ξ . With
M(xe) = Q(x− ξ) in hand, we can show that
S2(0, ξ) = 0 and
∂S2(e, ξ)
∂e
∣∣∣∣
e=0
= 0.
Thus, S2(e, ξ) can be expressed as S2(e, ξ) = eT Sˆ2(e, ξ)e
for some continuous matrix Sˆ2(e, ξ). Moreover, a
simple algebraic calculation shows that Sˆ2(0, 0) =
∂2Y3(x)/∂x2
∣∣
x=0. Since the latter matrix is, by hypothe-
sis, negative definite, we can conclude that Y2(xe) = 0 at
xe = col(x, x) and Y2(xe) < 0 elsewhere. This completes
the proof. Q.E.D.
5 Parameterization of Controllers
Practically, it would be advantageous to have a controller
that can simultaneously satisfy multiple performance ob-
jectives. In other words, among all the H∞ contrllers, for
example, the one with an additional H2 optimal perfor-
mance will be preferably adopted than others. In light
of this, it would be advantageous to firstly find all the
H∞ controllers and then use some additional criteria to
find controllers that can fulfill other performance. It is
the main purpose of this section is to give a parameter-
ization of a family of H∞ controllers. Motivated by the
work of [9, 11], the family of controllers to be considered
is described by a set of DAEs of the following form
Eξ(k+ 1) = F(ξ(x),w∗(ξ(k)), u∗(ξ(k)) + λ(η(k)))
+ G(ξ(k))(y(k)− Y(ξ(k),w∗(ξ(k)), u∗(ξ(k))
+ λ(η(k))))
E˜η(k+ 1) = φ(θ(y(k))
−θ(Y(ξ(k),w∗(ξ(k)), u∗(ξ(k))), η(k)))
u(k) = u∗(ξ(k)) + λ(η(k)), (27)
where E˜ ∈ RnQ×nQ is a constant matrix with rankE˜ =
rQ ≤ nQ, ξ and η are defined on some neighborhoods
of the origions in Rn and RnQ , respectively. G(·) is the
output injection gain, φ(·, ·), λ(·), and θ(·, ·) are smooth
functions with φ(0, 0) = 0, λ(0) = 0, and θ(0, 0) = 0. We
want to show how the functions φ(·, ·), λ(·), and θ(·, ·)
can be chosen so that the closed-loop system (1)-(27) is
locally asymptotically stable with index one and has an
L2-gain that is less than or equal to γ. Let xa = col(x, η)
and set
Ea =
[
E 0
0 E˜
]
,
Fa(xa,w) =
[
F(x,w, 0)−G(x)Y(x,w∗(x), 0)
φ(θ(Y(x,w, 0), η))
]
.
Then we have the following theorem, which is one of the
main results of this report.
Theorem 9. Consider (1) and (27). SupposeA1) toA4),H1)
toH3) hold. Suppose also that the following hypothesis holds.
H4) There exists an output injection gain G(·) and a smooth,
