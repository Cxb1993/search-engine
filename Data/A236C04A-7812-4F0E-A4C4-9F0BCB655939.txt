一、 前言、 
The relationship between exchange rates and stock prices is usually discussed and has 
important implications. There are two theories about the dynamic relationship between 
exchange rates and stock prices [17]. First, one claims that a depreciation of the domestic 
currency makes local firms more competitive, leading to an increase in their exports and 
consequently higher stock prices. This implies a positive correlation between exchange rates 
and stock prices. On the contrary, another approach argues that an increase in stock prices 
induces investors to demand more domestic assets and thereby causes an appreciation in the 
domestic currency. On both of the above theories, we know that the volatility of the New 
Taiwan Dollar (NTD) against US Dollar (USD) may affect both exporters and importers 
significantly in Taiwan which is a typical island-style economic system, highly open to 
international trade and investment. Because the NTD/USD plays a crucial role and may 
possibly influence Taiwan’s economy, the forecasting analysis in exchange rate is an 
important topics. Especially, in the financial crisis, there was a tremendous change in the 
exchange rate of the NTD against USD from 2008 to Aug. 2009. In forecasting, statistical 
methods such as time series model are the commonly used tools, but it has been suggested 
more recently that linear conventional time series methodologies fail to consider with limited 
time series data. This leads to inefficient estimation and therefore lower testing power [1].  
 
二、 研究目的、 
As we know, every prediction model is designed with the hope to obtain the 
characteristics of the system. The more the information that relate to the system dynamics are 
considered, the better the prediction will be. In this paper, Markov chain based on statistical 
method is incorporated with the fuzzy time series model to further enhance the predicted 
accuracy. Markov chain [9, 10] requires the prediction object to be a stationary process. Since 
the change of the exchange rate is a non-stationary process, it is necessary to combine fuzzy 
time series model with Markov chain. Furthermore, the statistics of the exchange rate from 
2008 to Aug. 2009 is used to verify the effectiveness of proposed model. The experimental 
results show that the proposed model has proved an effective tool in the prediction of the 
trend of exchange rate.  
 
三、 文獻探討、 
Therefore, an alternative approach, fuzzy time series model [12-14] have been developed and 
applied in forecasting as if the given datum is in linguistic terms or smaller than fifty data. 
Song and Chissom (S&C in abbreviation) were the pioneers of studying fuzzy time series 
model in 1993, then fuzzy time series model had drawn much attention to the researchers. For

transition times from state iA
~  to jA
~  by one step and Mi is the number of data belonging to 
the iA

R                
For the matrix R, some definitions are described as below: 
Definition 4. [10] If 0≥ijP , then state jA~  is accessible from state iA~ . 
Definition 5. [10] If states iA
~  and jA
~  are accessible each other, then state iA
~  
communicates with state jA
~ . 
Property 1. [10] The relation of communication satisfies the following three properties: 
(i) State iA
~  communicates with state iA
~ , all 0≥i . 
(ii) If stae iA
~  communicates with state jA
~ , then state jA
~  communicates with stae iA
~ . 
(iii) If state iA
~  communicates with state jA
~ , and state jA
~  communicates with state kA
~ , 
then state iA
~  communicates with state kA
~ . 
The transition probability matrix R reflects the transition rules of the system. For example, if 
the original data is located in the state 1
~A , next make a transition into state jA
~  with 
probability 01 ≥jP , nji  ,....,2 ,1 =∀ ; then 1

五、 結果與討論 
In the financial crisis, there was a tremendous change in the exchange rate of the New 
Taiwan Dollar (NTD) against USD from 2008 to Aug. 2009. In this section, an efficient 
estimation with smaller forecasting error using the proposed is illustrated as below. Therefore, 
in this illustrated example, a comparison to the popular forecasting methods grey method and 
ARIMA-GARCH are shown in Figure 4 and Table 8. It is obviously that the proposed 
method is better than the other two methods with the smallest forecasting error.
