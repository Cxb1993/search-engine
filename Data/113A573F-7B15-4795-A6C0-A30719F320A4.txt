現代電子工業高科技廠房潔淨室之外氣空調箱(MAU)為了要冷卻、除濕或預
熱、加濕大量外氣，使得外氣空調箱的能量佔去了 30%至 65%。由於高耗能意
味著高運轉費用，換言之連帶的連生產成本也為之升高。但外氣空調箱仍可藉著
改變冷卻的方式或更換加熱的熱源達到節約能源的要求。本研究將著重在探討以
現有成熟產品或設計，例如採用熱回收冰機提供外氣空調箱再熱熱源、雙溫度冰
水冷卻方式、外氣空調箱風機位置安排等設計，來檢討何種設計方式能夠達到較
佳的節能效果，並檢討外氣空調箱內部及各周邊設備設計參數的改變對外氣空調
箱整體節能效果的影響。 
關鍵字：節能設計，潔淨室空調系統、外氣空調箱 
一、報告內容 
1. 前言 
由於高科技產業(如半導體及光電工業)潔淨室內的排氣系統，必須將製程中
之產生或由製程化學藥品所揮發之各種有害氣體排出室外。由於排氣量非常巨大
加上佔地廣大的潔淨室正壓環境操作的要求，相對的使得外氣補充量提高，所以
連帶的外氣的冷卻負荷量變得非常驚人，因此如何降低外氣的冷卻負荷，進而降
低製冷所需電力而達到降低製造成本的要求，成為電子工業設施工程操作者或規
劃者非常關心的課題。 
2. 研究目的 
由於台灣地區夏季屬濕熱天候，而所需除濕冷卻的電力需求亦為最大，故本
文中將以夏季時的尖峰負載為研究標的。為簡化問題，在本研究中將各種空調設
備搭配空調部品的排列方式以及操作參數分類為幾種排列組合方式以方便比較
其中之優缺點。本研究中有關外氣空調箱之操作條件、各盤管及風機性能要求如

(3).外氣空調箱採用單溫度冰水與雙溫度冰水耗能的比較 
前面曾言及不同的冰水溫度採用有助於降低外氣空調箱電力消耗，故在本研
究中也將選用 5 oC (單溫度冰水)與 5oC / 9oC(雙溫度冰水)的耗能差異。雖然第一
級冷卻盤管雖然可操作 5oC 與 9oC 兩種冰水溫度，但我們必需注意盤管本身的熱
傳性能仍未改變，例如熱傳係數及接近溫差(Approach temperature difference，
ΔTapproach)，以本例之第一級冷卻盤管，其 ΔTapproach = 15oC。因此當第一級冷卻盤
管的冰水入口溫度上升為 9oC 時，離風溫度將從原來的乾球溫度 20oC 上升到如
圖六所示的 24oC，在外氣條件不變下，第一級冷卻盤管的熱容量因此將降低。
然而第二級盤管的除熱能力仍維持原狀，外氣空調箱的出風工況(溫濕度)將提
高，從而外氣空調箱整體對外氣冷卻其除濕的能力是下降的。如圖七所示，以鼓

式、鼓風-雙溫度冰水-使用熱回收冰水主機為再熱源式等八種外氣空調箱設計，
其耗能情況已顯示於本研究中，依據本研究的結果與討論，可歸納出以下幾點結
論 
(1). 外氣空調箱設計中以抽風-雙溫度冰水-使用熱回收冰水主機為再熱源式最節
能，而以鼓風-單溫度冰水-使用加熱器為再熱源式最為耗能。 
(2). 抽風式外氣空調箱風機耗能，較鼓風式外氣空調箱風機為低。 
(3). 當第一級盤管供應冰水溫度上升，倘若不更換盤管無法達到原設計要求的冷
卻及除濕量，其外氣空調箱離風溫度及濕度將較原設計偏差甚多。故必需配
合更換盤管方能達到原始設計中冷卻除濕以及節能的效果。當一級冷卻盤管
之冰水溫度上升到 9oC 時，其製冷電力需求將減少 8.2%。

However, no literature discusses the application of adiabatic
humidification in large-scale cleanrooms. Figures 2a and 2b
demonstrates the psychrometric processes of both humidify-
ing a cleanroom by high-pressure water atomization adiabatic
humidification and by MAU (i.e. by steam or mist humidifi-
cation). In Figure 2a, evaporating cooling of the adiabatic
humidification is noted.
On the other hand, the energy consumption for control-
ling humidity by MAU is huge. Generally, the power
consumption of air-conditioning in a semiconductor clean-
room is about 40% of the total power consumption (Hu and
Chuah (2003)). Within this percentage, the chiller creates
around 50% of the load. Breaking the power burden down
further, the MAU consumes nearly half of the power load of
the chiller (Hu and Chuah (2003)). Therefore, it is very impor-
tant to take energy consumption into consideration during
selection of a MAU. Brown (1990) identified energy-saving
opportunities within MAU systems for five climate regions in
the US. Adiabatic humidification was mentioned, however, no
field evaluation and further discussion on cost/energy-saving
was presented. Most energy efficiency discussions on MAU
focused on fan/cooling coil efficiencies such as Naughton
(1990), Most recently, Tsao and Hu (2008) presented a
comparative study for MAU system performance with eight
different component combinations. The most energy efficient
combination was highlighted. However, none of the above
articles discussed the possibility of adiabatic humidification.
Energy-saving effect by adiabatic humidification in clean-
rooms was not discussed in previous papers either. This paper,
therefore, aims to investigate the possibility of using adiabatic
humidifying technology in high-tech cleanrooms and to eval-
uate its energy-saving effect.

water were: bacteria: less than 0.5 CFU/Liter (under 48 hour
culture), particles greater than 0.5 m: less than 1 particle/
Liter, particles greater than 0.1μm: less than 50 particle/Liter,
sodium and chloride: less than 5 ppt, metals: less than 5 ppt.
No problem due to water quality was reported. In the experi-
ment, we used a pump with 70 bar of working pressure. As the
length from the mist sprinkler to the inlet of the Fan Filter Unit
(FFU) is over 6m, and the air velocity in this region is less than
3m/s, the selection of mist diameter of 40 m is small enough
to ensure that all the mist is evaporated before entering the
filter, according to Equation (1). The experiments were
conducted under two different conditions, with the humidifi-
ers installed in front of and after the cooling coil. The first
condition is the observation of the evaporation of liquid drop-
lets. The humidifier was installed in front of the cooling coil.
This is to observe whether the rest of the liquid remains as
droplets and whether the fogging occurs on the cooling coil.
The second condition, also shown in Figure 1, is to install the
humidifier after the cooling coil and to install a dehumidified
air-handling unit to simulate different make-up air conditions.
This is to observe the distribution and the stability of RH and
dry-bulb temperature. The location of measuring point and
purpose of measurement are illustrated in Table 2.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Field Humidification Performance
In the first part of the experiment, the chilled water valve
of the cooling coil was fully opened. The objective was to test
whether fogging occurs on the cooling coil under full loading
conditions. Visual observation shows that there was no fog on
the surface of the cooling coils. This was further confirmed by
the measured RH data at MP2, which was about 63%. The
second part of experiment was to observe the humidifying
distribution and the stability. As shown in Figure 3, the average
dry-bulb temperature at MP5 was about 21.8°C (71.3°F). The
average relative humidity at MP5 was 59%, and the corre-
sponding mist temperature was 13.3°C (56°F).
These were similar to those controlled by MAU, indicat-
ing that the mist had enough time and distance to be fully
absorbed by the recirculating air. The result corresponded to
that of the first part of the experiment. The measured data at
MP1 represents the conditions in the cleanroom. As shown in
Figure 4, the RH controlled by adiabatic humidification exhib-
its a larger fluctuation (about ±1%) compared to that
controlled by MAU, and the mean value within the target value
(55 ± 5%). The RH variation at MP3 is similar to that of MP4,
indicating the mixing of make-up air with the recirculating air
was far behind after the exit point of make-up air duct. When
the RH of make-up air varies dramatically (RH varies from 70
to 100% as the MP4 shown in Figure 5), the RH and dry-bulb
temperature at MP1 was still very stable and can still be stabi-
lized to within ±1%, also shown in Figure 5.
Energy-Saving Effect by High-Pressure Water 
Atomization Adiabatic Humidification
As shown in Figures 2a and 2b and Table 1, two impacts
on energy-saving were observed. First, for humidifying by
MAU, to increase the humidity in the cleanroom from 2.65

CONCLUSION
Adiabatic humidification with spray nozzles using high-
pressure water atomization in a cleanroom of a TFT-LCD
fabrication plant is conducted. The energy-saving potential
and initial cost analysis of this application is also presented.
Based on the results and discussion, the following conclusions
are drawn:
1. Both the space distribution and the time variation of RH
are within ±1%, even when the humidity of the make-up
air varies drastically. Adiabatic humidification is theoret-
ically and practically feasible in a large-scale cleanroom
of a TFT-LCD fabrication plant that requires high humid-
ity (55 ± 5% RH in this study).
2. With adiabatic humidification, the initial capital cost of
the MAU is greatly reduced, as no humidifying equip-
ment, or the associated operation and maintenance, is
required in the MAU. Energy-savings due to saving on
producing steam is most notable, and is about four times
greater due to evaporation cooling of the mist. Pumping
energy for the water of humidifier is trivial compared
with energy saved by heating of the boiler.
3. For the adiabatic humidification, the “spray nozzles using
high-pressure water atomization” method is favorable
than the “two-fluids humidification” method, based on
the operational and initial costs.

A negative pressure isolation room is built to accommodate and cure patients with highly infec-
tious diseases. An absolutely airtight space effectively prevents infectious diseases from leaking
out of the isolation room. Opening the door leads to a breakdown in isolation conditions and
causes the dispersion of infectious air out of the isolation room. Extensively employed to manage
smoke in cases of ﬁres at subway and highway tunnels, a concept of controlling airﬂow is applied
to the study. This study proposes a design of ventilation system to control air ﬂow rate for con-
taining airborne contaminant and preventing its spread to the adjacent rooms when the door to
the isolation room is opened and closed. This paper employs computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD)
as a more effective approach to examine the concentration maps of airborne contaminants and
the airﬂow patterns of room air and discuss the inﬂuence of temperature differences between
two rooms on airborne dispersion. Results show that an air velocity above 0.2 m/s via a doorway
effectively prevents the spread of airborne contaminants out of the isolation room in the state of
door opening.

1. Introduction
Effective isolation measures in the isolation room are impor-
tant for controlling the airborne spread of infectious diseases.
Several infectious agents such as severe acute respiratory syn-
drome (SARS) [1] and tuberculosis (TB) [2] are transmitted by
aerosols. The experience with SARS in 2003 has triggered in-
creased attention to the problem of aerosol transmission, short
range between healthcare workers and their patients [3–5]. Air-
borne transmission of contaminants may be restricted by the
use of a negative pressure isolation room [6]. However, when
the door of an isolation room is opened, the ventilation system
fails to maintain the required negative pressure difference within
the room, and this failure results in the dispersion of airborne
contaminants out of the room [7]. An experimental model indi-
cates that opening the door leads to a breakdown in isolation
conditions and causes the transmission of infectious air out of
the isolation room [8]. How to prevent the airborne transmission
in the case of door opening is therefore an issue of grave impor-
tance. Therefore, this study proposes an arrangement of an ante-
room to separate the isolation room and the corridor. The
anteroom acts as an airlock to prevent direct dispersion of air-
borne contaminants from the room to the corridor. However,
when the door of an isolation room is opened, the airborne con-
taminants in the isolation room will directly disperse to the ante-
room instead of the corridor; healthcare workers leaving the
isolation room and entering the anteroom are therefore at a high-
er risk of being infected.
Hence, it is crucial to understand the transmission of contami-
nated air through the doorway into the anteroom and take proper
measures to reduce the spread of airborne contaminants from the
isolation room. Air changes per hour (ACH) of ventilation system
and airﬂow pattern of room air movement exercise considerable
impacts on the control of airborne contaminant diffusion [9]. It is
noted that airﬂow control is extensively employed to manage
smokes from ﬁres at subway, railroad and highway tunnels.
Accordingly, controlling the airﬂow to dominate the room air
movement will be evaluated in the present work on the prevention
of airborne contaminant transmission. In general, the computa-
tional ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) method is effectively employed to
evaluate the effect of different air supply systems on indoor air dis-
tribution and ventilation effectiveness [10]. The numerical results
from CFD software Fluent adopted to predict particle transport
and distribution in ventilated rooms agree well with associated
experimental data [11]. Using CFD to evaluate the performance
of ventilation systems, our study aims to propose a strategy of pre-
venting the dispersion of airborne contaminants from the isolation
room when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed.

Fluent [14] the solver engine solves the governing equations for the
conservation of mass and momentum as well as for energy and
other scalars, such as turbulence and chemical species. Turbulence
models (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations), especially
two-equation model, already become the universal used methods
in the computation of indoor ﬂow ﬁeld [15]. The popular k-emodel
has been successfully applied to simulate indoor airﬂow ﬁelds
[16,17], and the performance of the standard k-e turbulence model
is good for the prediction of natural and forced convection in a
room [16]. The standard k-e turbulence model [18] developed ear-
lier, gained the broadest application in the indoor airﬂow calcula-
tion [7,11,19–22], and was used to predict the airﬂow ﬁeld in our
study. The related fundamentals of CFD modeling of ﬂuid ﬂow
and turbulence are available in References [23].
A control-volume-based technique [14] is used to convert the
governing equation into an algebraic equation that can be solved
numerically. This control volume technique consists of integrating
the governing equations about each control volume, yielding dis-
crete equations that conserve each quantity on a control-volume
basis. The governing equation complies with the principle of con-
servation and is expressed in general form as follows:
o
ot
ðq/Þ þ divðqV/Þ ¼ divðC/r/Þ þ S/; ð1Þ
Here q represents the density, / the dependent variables, C/ the
effective exchange coefﬁcient for the dependent variable /, and
S/ the source term. Table 2 tabulates the parameters /, C/,
and S/ employed in continuity, momentum, energy, contaminant,
and turbulence equations.
Field variables (stored at cell centers) must be interpolated to
the faces of the control volumes in the ﬁnite volume method.
Accounting for the buoyancy ﬂow within the model room, the
Boussinesq approximation was employed. The diffusion terms
were central-differenced and always second-order accurate. Using
the second-order discretization will generally obtain more accu-
rate results. Thus, the second order upwind scheme was used for
the treatment of the convection and diffusion-convection terms
in the governing equation. After discretization, the transport equa-
tion contains the unknown scalar variable / at the cell center as
well as the unknown values in surrounding neighbor cells. This
equation, in general, is non-linear with respect to these variables.
A linearized conservation equation for a general variable / at a cell
P can be written as follows [14]:
ap/p ¼
X
nb
anb/nb þ b; ð2Þ
where the subscript nb refers to neighbor cells, ap the center coefﬁ-
cient for /, anb the inﬂuence coefﬁcients for the neighboring cells
/nb, and b the source term. This results in a set of algebraic equa-
tions with a sparse coefﬁcient matrix. For scalar equations, Fluent
solves this linear system using a point implicit (Gauss-Seidel) linear
equation solver in conjunction with an algebraic multi-grid (AMG)
method. The algorithm of semi-implicit method for pressure linked
equations (SIMPLE) [24] was used to solve iteratively the pressure-
velocity coupling equations [11,25–29].
Moreover, this study judged the convergence not only by exam-
ining residual levels, but also by monitoring relevant integrated
quantities. All discrete conservation equations are obeyed in all
cells to a speciﬁed tolerance and solution no longer changes with
more iterations. The convergence criterion in this study requires
that the scaled residuals decrease to 104 for all equations in the
governing equations except the energy, for which the criterion is
106.
Four grid densities, 83,274 (Case 1), 153,618 (Case 2), 220,714
(Case 3), and 310,284 (Case 4) cells, were investigated to perform
the gird sensitivity study. The grid is structured, and cells are hexa-
hedral. Fig. 2 presents the results of grid independent test; here V
refers to the velocity magnitude of room air monitored at a speciﬁc
location close to the patient, Vo the maximum velocity magnitude
of room air at the boundary condition of velocity inlet, H the height
of room air monitored at the speciﬁc location close to the patient,
and Ho the height of room. The dimensionless velocity at the mon-
itored points in the case of 220,714 cells was quite close to the one
in the case of 310,284 cells; moreover, the relative error of the
average dimensionless velocity of room air between Cases 1 and
2, Cases 2 and 3, and Cases 3 and 4 reported 0.89%, 1.06%, and
0.42%, respectively. As the difference between Cases 3 and 4 was
insigniﬁcant, it could be concluded that the grid system reached
an independent solution. Therefore, the grid density with
220,714 cells was found to be sufﬁcient and applied into the con-
tinue study.
The standard wall functions for the k-e turbulence model were
adopted to link the solution variables at the near-wall cells and the
corresponding quantities near the wall. The standard wall func-
tions employed in our study is based on the proposal of Launder
and Spalding that have been extensively used for industrial ﬂows.
To resolve reliable turbulence phenomena near the wall, the grid
nearest to the wall fell into the logarithmic layer (that is, y+
>30–60). Moreover, the turbulence kinetic energy k and the turbu-
lence kinetic energy dissipation rate e employed in air supply and
air outlet are calculated by the following equations:
k ¼ 3
2
ðuavgIÞ2; ð3Þ
e ¼ C3=4l ðk3=2lÞ; ð4Þ
l ¼ 0:07Dh; ð5Þ
where uavg refers to the mean ﬂow velocity, I the turbulence inten-
sity, Dh the hydraulic diameter, and Cl = 0.09.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Airﬂow patterns
In order to provide controlled airﬂow patterns, the air supply
and exhaust are located so that clean air ﬂows ﬁrst to parts of
the roomwhere healthcare workers probably work and then across
the infectious source and into the exhaust [30]. The air, therefore,
ﬂows from a cleaner area (the anteroom) to a contaminated area
(the isolation room) to prevent the spread of airborne contami-
nants. In case of mechanical ventilation failure as in Fig. 3(a), the

airﬂow direction was thermally driven. A clockwise swirl of airﬂow
was generated in the isolation room; room air ﬂowed from the iso-
lation room to the anteroom; and the swirl carried the airborne
contaminants from the contaminated area to the cleaner area. As
revealed in Fig. 3(b), when the mechanical ventilation started to
function at a rate of 12 ACH, the direction of its airﬂow was con-
trary to the one in Fig. 3(a). It was noted that the reversed airﬂow
occurred at the doorway due to the effects of thermal buoyancy
and an average temperature difference of 1.59 C between the
two rooms, causing the airborne contaminants to be spread into
the anteroom. An arrangement of left-upper ceiling supply and
right-lower wall exhaust plus a mechanical ventilation system re-
sulted in airﬂow swirl rotating counter-clockwisely in the upper
parts of the isolation room. However, increasing the ﬂow rate to
24 or 48 ACH helped eliminate the phenomenon of reversed ﬂow
and restricted the swirls to the local area of the isolation room
(Fig. 3(c) and (d)), as more air ﬂowing at the rates of 24 and 48
ACH reduced the average temperature difference between the
two rooms to 1.05 and 0.63 C, respectively, and decreased thermal
buoyancy. Additionally, the ASHRAE Standard limits the air veloc-
ity to a speciﬁed maximum of 0.8 m/s in summer for thermal com-
fort [31]. Based on the results of simulation, the maximum air

tion of airborne contaminants in the anteroom was 0.155 ppm, i.e.
0.000538 % of the concentration of airborne contaminants at the
source generated by the patient. This value was much lower
than the source concentration and approached zero ppm; there-
fore, the ventilation system at a rate of 48 ACH effectively
separated the anteroom and the isolation room. The present study
veriﬁed that an airﬂow velocity above 0.2 m/s as recommended in
the ISO 14644, a standard for cleanrooms and associated subjects,
could be adopted for application to isolation rooms and effectively
controlled the movement of airborne contaminants.
3.3. Inﬂuence of the healthcare worker and medical equipment in the
isolation room on the ventilation effect
Lightings and the patient were the original heat sources and re-
sulted, respectively, in an average temperature difference of 1.59
and 0.63 C between the isolation room and anteroom for the cases
of 12 and 48 ACH. With the presence of a healthcare worker and
medical equipment in the isolation room, these additional heat
sources raised the average temperature difference to 3.5 and 1.8
C between the two rooms for the cases of 12 and 48 ACH, respec-
tively. The standing person caused a ﬂow disturbance, and the heat
generated thermal plumes that could bring the airborne contami-
nants to the upper zone. The convective ﬂow around the patient
brought the air at a lower zone to the breathing zone of the stand-
ing person. Therefore, the healthcare worker was exposed in an
area with a higher concentration of airborne contaminants. How-
ever, a mechanical ventilation system above 48 ACH was able to
extract airborne contaminant and reduced its concentration. The
left-side upper corners of the isolation room as shown in Fig. 6
stayed as high contamination zones. The increase in the tempera-
ture difference caused airﬂow reversal at the doorway in the cases
of 12 and 24 ACH, resulting in stronger diffusion of airborne con-
taminants from the isolation room to the anteroom and raising
the contaminant concentration in the anteroom in the cases of
12 and 48 ACH from 15.16 to 21.25 ppm and from 0.16 to 0.55
ppm, respectively. The contaminant concentration in the isolation
room was slightly increased as well in the cases of 12 and 48 ACH
from 48.811 to 50.81 ppm and from 13.19 to 13.40 ppm, respec-
tively. Fig. 7 illustrates that the highest contaminant concentration
was found above the head of the patient and stronger airﬂow (Case
48 ACH) effectively prevented the diffusion of contaminant
concentration.
3.4. Ventilation system recommended for a negative pressure isolation
room
According to the above results, this study proposed a ventilation
system as shown in Fig. 8 to prevent the spread of airborne con-
taminants from the negative pressure isolation room. Normally,
the motorized airtight dampers M1-M4 were open, and manual
volume dampers, VD, were modulated once in order to provide
the required ACH and negative pressure differentials in the ante-
room and the isolation room. In the case of door opening, while
interlocking with the door, airtight dampers M2 and M3 were
automatically closed to raise the ﬂow rate of air into the anteroom.
Accordingly, sufﬁcient air ﬂowed at a rate above 48 ACH from the
ceiling supply air vent in the anteroom through the doorway and
resulted in an air velocity above 0.2 m/s to effectively prevent
the spread of airborne contaminants.
4. Conclusions
The present study improves understanding on how ventilation
air is distributed and how airborne contaminants are transported
in the isolation room and anteroom and increases awareness of
the potential health risk associated with the airborne contami-
nants in the case of mechanical ventilation system failure. Airﬂow
patterns are analyzed to be affected by ventilation rates and air
temperature differentials. In addition, a design of ventilation sys-
tem is proposed to control air ﬂow rate for containing airborne
contaminant and preventing its spread to the adjacent anteroom
when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed. It should
be further noted that studies on clean rooms suggest that an air-
ﬂow velocity above 0.2 m/s is capable of effectively controlling
the movement of airborne contaminants. Our research veriﬁes that
the same ﬁnding can also be applied to regulate the movement of
airborne contaminants in isolation rooms. Yet, how the movement
of healthcare workers through the doorway of the isolation room
may inﬂuence the ability of airﬂow to prevent the spread of air-
borne contaminants remains an issue that merits future studies.
