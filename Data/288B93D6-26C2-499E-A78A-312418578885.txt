DRS system that can work with the MTL probe to deduce the optical properties of 
superficial tissues.   
 
Objective 
The MTL probe has been fabricated and applied to study various superficial 
tissues; however its applicability has not been studied systematically. We will 
characterize the performance of the MTL geometry in detail using Monte Carlo 
simulations and experiments, so that we can understand the probe’s interrogation 
depth under various circumstances where the probe’s parameters and samples’ optical 
properties have different combinations.  This has not been done and is extremely 
crucial since different applications may require the information at different depths.  
Therefore, it is important to properly design the probe geometry to limit the 
interrogation region, so that one can retrieve useful information from tissues at a 
certain depth for specific diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  In summary, in the 
first year of this project, we plan to achieve the following goals: 
1. Constructing a steady state Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) system 
2. Characterizing the MTL geometry in detail using Monte Carlo simulations  
3. Optimizing MTL probe design and algorithm to achieve depth sectioning in a 
single measurement 
 
Methods 
The geometry of the MTL probe employed in this sutdy is illustrated in Fig. 1. The 
fibers employed in this probe are 480µm diameter low OH multimode fibers (core 
diameter=440µm) with numerical aperture of 0.22. The diameter of the high 
scattering, low absorption Spectralon (Labshpere, NH, USA) disc is 6.5mm. The 
detection fiber penetrates the 1mm thick Spectralon layer so that it is flush with the 
lower surface of the Spectralon. There are four source fibers placed on the upper 
surface of the Spectralon and their distances from the detection fiber are 1.44mm, 
1.92mm, 2.4mm, and 2.88mm, respectively. The detection fiber was connected to a 
spectrometer equipped with a back-thinned CCD (Model# BTC613, B&W TEK, DE, 
USA). An 1*4 optical switch (Piezosystem jena, MA, USA) was employed to switch 
between one fiber that is connected to a broadband Tungsten Halogen light source 
(Model# HL2000, Ocean Optics, FL, USA) and four source fibers of the MTL probe.

2(a) represents photon distribution in light complexion skin at 500nm and Fig. 2(b) 
represents photon distribution in light complexion skin at 900nm. Comparing Fig. 2(a) 
and 2(b) qualitatively, it can be seen the “-4” contour line in Fig. 2(b) is wider and 
deeper than that in Fig. 2(a). This means the diffusing probe has deeper interrogation 
depths at 900nm compared to the interrogation depths at 500nm.

than that in (a). Please refer to text for the parameters used. 
 
The absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of in-vivo dorsal forearm of 
eighteen subjects are demonstrated in Fig. 3. The data shown in Fig. 3 are in good 
agreement with those obtained from ex-vivo measurements and the in-vivo data 
reported earlier.[20] In Fig. 3(a), the absorption coefficients of the dorsal forearm of 
skin type I-II and III-IV increase steeply by a factor of two as the wavelength 
decreases from 600nm to 500nm. Hemoglobin and melanin both contribute to the 
increase in the absorption in this region. From ex-vivo measurement of extinction 
coefficients of hemoglobin, the abrupt increase at 600nm is one of the signatures of 
hemoglobin.[21] The optical properties of the dorsal forearm of skin type V-VI in the 
region from 500 to 600nm are not shown here since the skin was too absorbing and 
the measured reflectance were too noisy to recover accurate optical properties.

Conclusion 
We have reported the optical properties of in-vivo skin of skin phototypes I-VI in the 
wavelength from 500nm to 1000nm. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations and 
generated photon fluence distribution maps to characterize the interrogation region of 
the diffusing probe in typical skin. The results of these simulations indicate that the 
interrogation depth at 500nm is at least 46% shallower than that at 900nm for skin. 
We can extrapolate this to mean that the skin optical properties obtained with this 
probe at wavelengths shorter than 600nm are more relevant to the upper dermis and 
the epidermis while those obtained at wavelengths longer than 600nm are more 
relevant to the lower dermis. We used the results of these simulations to assist with 
the analysis of absorption and reduced scattering spectra of in-vivo skin. Our results 
agree with those reported by other researchers and thus further support and validate 
our proposed method. In the future, we will employ this probe to study skin 
photoaging and skin diseases.

Self-evaluation 
In the first year of this project, we have developed a custom system which includes a 
light source, a spectrometer and a special optical fiber probe. First, we carried out 
computer simulations to realize the performance of the system, for instance, the 
interrogation depth and volume of the probe. Then we employed the system to 
measure the optical properties, such as scattering and absorption, of in-vivo skin from 
various skin phototypes. To our knowledge, this is the first time in the biomedical 
optics field that a research team can attain such results and perform the analyses. We 
found that the scattering property of skin was closely related to the average size and 
density of collagen and elastin bundles and irrelevant to the skin colors. In addition, 
we also found that the upper dermis had oxygen saturation of 50~60% while the lower 
dermis had oxygen saturation of 95~99%. Our results indicated that our system was 
able to effectively determine the properties of upper dermis, such as hemoglobin 
concentration and average density and size of collagen and elastin bundles. The 
outcome of this project has potential impact on cosmeceutical industry and skin 
diagnostic applications. Specifically, we could use this system for quantification of 
the ageing of in-vivo skin and measure the efficacy of the anti-ageing treatment on 
skin. Moreover, we have actively worked with Prof. 許漢銘 at NCKU dermatology 
department, and will utilize our system to monitor the genesis and treatment of skin 
cancer in the near future. We expect our system can provide insight into the 
mechanism of skin cancer genesis and determine the efficiency of certain medical 
treatment on skin cancer. We have reduced part of our results into two papers and 
published on “Optics Express” and “Journal of Biomedical Optics”.

which provide novel modalities for optical imaging and light controlled therapy.  
In addition, very good quality talks in the field of biosensing were delivered by various speakers. For 
instance, A. Kabashin presented using nanoplasmonics for biosensing. He introduced a series of methods 
and designs toward the improvement of characteristics of plasmonics biosensors, their miniaturization 
and creation of novel nano-architechtures. T. Nakabayashi presented that using fluorescence lifetime 
imaging of fluorescent proteins for sensing intracellular pH. He demonstrated that the fluorescence light 
time decreased with decreasing intracellular pH. A. Mayevsky presented using optical methods to assess 
the health and disease of mitochondria. He developed an optical system to monitor the fluorescence of 
NADH which is closely related to the mitochondrial function. Hung-Yu Tseng presented their work in 
utilizing gold nano rings to enhance the OCT image contrast. With light source of wavelength at 1300nm, 
the nano rings strongly glow, induced by the localized surface Plasmon effect, at wavelengths shorter than 
1200nm. 
 Overall, attending this conference is very beneficial. In addition to hearing many excellent talks, I was 
able to converse with several experts in nanophotonics. From the conversations, I learned the potential 
research directions in this field and the obstacles that needed to be overcome to bring the nano particle 
technology to a more clinical feasible level. Spending five days in this conference is fruitful; not only 
help me understand the state of the art status of the nanophtonics technology, but also very helpful for 
forming my future research directions.
