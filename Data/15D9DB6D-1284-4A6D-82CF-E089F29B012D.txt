一、中文摘要 
本計畫目標在於透過求解拋物線聲波方程式，以模擬聲波在三維海洋環境中與彈性底
床以及不規則介面耦合之傳播現象。過去為了簡化問題，常將底床的彈性特質忽略而視同
流體，因此並未將剪力波的效應考慮在內；然而過去主要在深海環境中因為聲波與底床之
接觸有限尚且容許如此的簡化，一旦環境改為淺海時，聲波能量進出底床的比例增加，剪
力波的影響便不容忽視。因此底床之彈性特質必須被考慮在內，俾使聲波之傳播能夠被正
確地呈現。就數值計算上而言，過去由於硬體資源有限，而捨真實的三維環境，改採經由
軸對稱之假設簡化而成的二維環境；然而在淺海環境中地形水文等參數隨空間變化程度甚
大，使軸對稱之假設無法成立，若要符合實際海洋環境空間上之變化，則必須採三維之考
量；加以電腦軟硬體之發展日趨進步，過去計算資源上的限制亦逐漸放寬。在此發展下，
本計畫將提出一個改進的數學模式用於預測在一個三維海洋環境中，與不規則流體/彈性體
介面耦合的聲音傳播，並提供一個隱式有限差分方法以獲得此一數學模式的數值解，用以
建立一個計算模型 C4PM。對於該模型採用的拋物線方程式解法程序步驟，本計畫從理論
以及數值計算兩個角度加以討論。同時並包含數個算例，透過與目前已知的參考解作比較，
以顯示該計算模型的確有能力處理具有剪力效應的問題，並且能夠得到一符合預期的數值
解。最後並提出接續本研究之未來期望發展方向與工作項目，包含數項可精進模式的方法，
如採用廣角方法、重新衡量遠場近似之應用、起始聲場之計算、探討更一般化之三維流體/
彈性體介面以及拋物線方程式模型之能量守恆性質等。

二、英文摘要 
This research is focused on modeling 3D wave propagation in the ocean coupled with elastic 
bottom and irregular interface by solving parabolic wave equations. In the past few decades the 
elastic properties of ocean bottom were usually ignored to simplify problems by assuming a fluid 
seabed. Nevertheless, while it is acceptable to make such assumptions in deep water, the effects of 
shear waves can never be omitted as long as sound waves penetrates into ocean bottom, especially in 
shallow water where interactions between sound waves and elastic bottom are very frequent. Hence, 
seabed has to be considered as elastic solids to correctly reveal the propagating behavior of sound 
waves. Besides, due to the shortness in hardware resources in the past, real 3D problems were often 
simplified to 2D through axial symmetry assumptions; however a real 3D environment must be 
taken into consideration especially in shallow water where the assumptions may not valid. In addition, 
the development of hardware and software is in huge progress so that limitation on computational 
resources has been gradually released. Under such circumstance, a novel mathematical model and an 
implicit finite difference method to obtain a numerical solution for predicting wave propagation in a 
3D ocean coupled with irregular fluid/solid interface are presented and developed into a computer 
code C4PM in this research. Theoretical and computational aspects of the proposed parabolic 
equation (PE) solution procedure are investigated. Several numerical examples are included to show 
satisfactory results after comparing to known reference solutions with shear effects. Finally the 
directions of future works are proposed which may enhance the model including the application of 
wide-angle scheme, revaluation of far-field approximation, generation of initial field, generalization to 
a 3D interface, and energy conserving property of PE model.

Equations in (2.2) are second-order partial differential in the variable r , but each can be separated into two 
uncoupled first order parabolic equations [12], one equation representing waves which propagate in the direction of 
increasing r , and the other equation representing waves which propagate in the direction of decreasing r . The 
separation gives the elastic outgoing wave equations in operator form

 (2.22) 
The vector G  is a function related to boundary conditions. The operators ijd  couple the elements between the 
interface and the fluid medium as well as the elastic medium. 
After a PE system is formulated in operators form, the next stage is to transform Eq. (2.21) into a numerical 
model. As the operator matrix M  is discretized and Eq. (2.21) becomes a system of difference equations, the 
coupling between medium and interface will be obviously shown by visualizing the discretized coefficients matrix 
M . 
3 Numerical Modeling 
This section is focused on transforming the theoretical PE expression into a numerical model consisting of three parts: 
theoretical development, computational aspects, and the development of the computer code. 
3.1 Scheme Development 
It is expected that for a coupled problem in heterogeneous media invested in this paper, the computational scheme 
will be based on an ODE, or split-step concept. 
3.1.1 Marching Scheme 
Assume that coupled wave PE system (2.21) has the discrete local solution as 
 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )1 .r rr r e r e rΔ Δ −+ Δ = + −M MV V I M G  (3.1) 
By direct replacing the exponential matrix in Eq. (3.1) by (1,1) Padé approximant, the result is obtained as the well 
known Crank-Nicolson scheme: 
 ( ) ( )11 12 2 .n n nr r r+− Δ = + Δ + ΔI M V I M V G  (3.2)

The subscripts ,i j  represent the i th grid point in depth, and j th grid point in azimuth. Note that if θΔ  is 
chosen so large as 1/ θΔ  approaches zero, the equations reduce to two-dimensional case.

 (3.11) 
As a summary, with the square root approximations and proper discretization, the numerical ODE formulations 
for elastic and fluid wave equations like Eq. (3.8) and the interface equations can be obtained. The complete results 
are referred to the first author’s Ph.D. dissertation [16] and not shown here. Results for wave equations in Ref. [5] are 
similar except for its equation of rB  where an error occurs in their derivation of wave equation for rB . 
3.2 Computational Aspects 
In order to develop the computer code, a number of computational aspects have to be taken into consideration. 
For simplicity, taking a horizontal interface problem as an example, Fig. 3.1 schematically shows computation 
grids and settings. As shown in Fig. 3.1, the upper boundary which usually refers to the ocean surface is assumed to 
be flat and pressure released

The lower boundary denoted as rigid bottom is assumed to be flat and force the first derivatives with respect to 
depth of all quantities to be zero

resulting to be a total reflecting boundary. The bottom boundary can also be set to zero for simplicity.

Fig. 3.2 Schematic of pressure release boundary in discrete space. 
Comparing Eqs. (3.14) and (3.15), it can be noted that considering mirror effect at pressure release boundaries 
not only maintains the consistency of using central difference formulas but also reduces the number of grid points 
from five to three at z z= Δ . 
For the port/starboard sidewall boundaries, they are not pressure released or rigid under most circumstances 
except for numerical tests. In realistic situations, they are not known and have to be computed and provided as 
boundary conditions of Dirichlet type 
 0,0, .Q fθ Ω= Ω =  (3.16) 
2D ( )r z−  solutions may be the most straightforward answers provided for sidewall boundaries. 
A computer code is developed to implement the marching implicit scheme (3.2). However, it must be mentioned 
that the mathematic and numerical development of the proposed model does not contain the density variation and 
other capability enhancement, the computer code is basically a research code. It still needs some efforts to turn this 
code into a practically working code like other well known models, say, FOR3D. 
The geometry of propagation has been presented in Fig. 3.1. The data structure should be particularly noticed 
since this model deals with a heterogeneous problem. That is, at a single grid point, there are more than one unknown 
quantities. Each field quantities , , , ,f e r zA A B B Bθ  is stored in separate matrices at the beginning and in its final 
form. However, during the calculation stage, solving the unknowns requires these field quantities to be organized as 
a single vector at each range step. The coefficient matrix corresponding to this unknown vector is thus constructed as 
the following figure shows along with the structure of the unknown vector. The figure shows an example of 9 
azimuth sections (side-wall boundaries excluded). Blue dots represent nonzero elements which are the coefficients of 
the difference equations. It can be seen that the matrix is formed as a band-matrix. Dark lines indicate different 
azimuth sections whereas the red dashed lines showing the five interface equations between the fluid and the elastic 
wave equations which are colored with light blue and olive boxes, respectively. The unknown vector is a column 
shown at right hand side of the coefficient matrix.

Using the presented numerical model, a banded matrix is formed to solve the problem with computation 
parameters set as 0.1 , 3f fz rλ λΔ = Δ = , where sound speed c  is 1500 m/s, sound frequency f  is 200 Hz, water 
depth H  is 60 m, wavelength 
fλ  is 7.5 m. Figure 4.1 compares the absolute value of computed solutions using 
(1,1)/(2,2) Padé scheme and sided/central difference near boundaries for range 0–12 km. It can be clearly seen that 
errors accumulate from the upper and lower boundaries if mirror effect is not considered and sided difference is 
applied. Also higher order scheme, such as (2,2) Padé scheme, is more sensitive to such errors from boundaries. 
However, if mirror effect is taken into account, then the errors are removed and (2,2) Padé scheme produces better 
results as it is expected. 
 
Fig. 4.1 Comparison between the computed solutions using (1,1)/(2,2) Padé scheme and sided/central difference near boundaries. 
By this test case, the marching scheme using (1,1)/(2,2) Padé approximations are validated. The improvement of 
considering mirror effect near pressure release boundaries is also presented. This suggests the consideration of mirror 
effect in all computations when pressure release boundaries occur. 
4.2 2D Elastic Waves in Range-Independent Environment 
The elastic wave governing equations are coupled for 3D propagation as two individual systems, { }eA  and 
{ }, ,r zB B Bθ . For 2D propagation, θ -derivatives are dropped so that rB  is uncoupled from the equation of Bθ , 
therefore the governing equations are further uncoupled into three independent sets, { }eA , { }Bθ , and { },r zB B . 
Provided there is no coupling mechanism on boundaries, 2D elastic waves problem can be resolved by separately 
finding the solutions of the three systems.

Fig. 4.4 Comparison between the calculated results of up/down-slope wedge with low/high shear wave speed. 
The lower plot compares the depth averaged energy along the propagation range for four difference situations. 
The green solid line represents the result calculated in down-slope wedge with very low shear wave speed ( Tc = 40 
m/s) comparing to the red dashed line where the shear wave speed is 900 m/s. These two line does not differ too 
much, i.e., shear effect is not obvious in down-slope wedge. In up-slope wedge, energy in water column is expected 
apparently decreasing due to more interaction between wave and bottom as shown in the figure. The blue dotted line 
represents the result calculated in up-slope wedge with shear wave speed being 40 m/s whereas the black solid line is 
the case with Tc = 900 m/s. It can be seen from the figure that there is noticeable difference due to shear effect for 
up-slope wedge. More energy of water column is transferred into bottom as shear wave. 
4.4 Coupled 3D Waves with Irregular Interface 
It has to be noticed as mentioned before that the analytic solutions to such problems are inaccessible. 
For simplicity, the upper and lower boundary conditions are pressure released boundaries, and the two side-wall 
boundary conditions are zeros as well. Given the environment setting being the same as before except for total depth 
of 70H =  m and a range-dependent bathymetry ( )IH r . For sound frequency of 25 Hz, the initial field is placed at 
0 1082.3r =  m to satisfy far-field approximation 100ik r ≥ , , ,i f L T= . The computational parameters are set as: 
0.4 14.4Tr λΔ = =  m, 0.5θΔ = D , and 0.015 0.54Tz λΔ = =  m. It must be noted that zΔ  is chosen so small to 
have accurate solutions because of the interface effect. Starting from 0r , the initial field is propagated 150 m which 
is about 10 range steps, and the computation span is 20 degrees which consists 21 sections including two side-wall 
boundaries. The bathymetry is defined as ( ) ( ) ( )0 0 035, 50 36, 100 34I I IH r H r H r= + = + = , and ( )0 150 37IH r + = , as 
shown in Fig. 4.5. It must be emphasized that the bathymetry is given of axial symmetry to be consistent with the 
irregular interface defined and shown in Fig. 2.1.  
Shear effect

energy can not only be transferred into but also output through coupling. Recalling 2D problems where the 
unknowns can be grouped as two sets, the mathematic or numerical formulations of the wave equations and interface 
equations have indicated that there is no coupling mechanism between { }, ,f eA A Bθ  and { },r zB B , and this 
coupling only exists in 3D problems. Similar outcome can be expected in results of zB  presented in subsequent 
figure after the plot of Bθ . Similar to the results of eA  plotted in Fig. 4.7(a), the results of Bθ  shown in Fig. 4.7(c) 
reveal the characteristics of energy spreading along the interface but not deep into the bottom. As mentioned in the 
above discussion of the results of rB , Fig. 4.7(d) shows expected feature similar to rB . From interface equations or 
numerical formulation, this feature shared by rB  and zB  is due to azimuth coupling at interface and thus is a kind 
of 3D effect.

The 3D example tested in this section is highly restrained and simplified to focus on the primary concerns, i.e., 
realization of the proposed model and how it works with coupled fluid/solid medium with irregular interface. It has 
to be emphasized that a major difference between considering fluid bottom and real elastic bottom is the demand in 
computation resources especially the CPU time. This is due to the increasing of the number of physical quantities in 
elastic bottom, from single one to four. The additional three, , ,r zB B Bθ , account for shear waves. Under the 
condition of same grid points, the coefficient matrix considering shear waves is 4 4×  times larger than fluid bottom. 
In other words, the range of interested problem is therefore practically limited. Nevertheless, this kind of technical 
shortness can be expected to be resolved just like decades ago, and the emphasis must be placed on pursuing the 
completeness in describing the problem and its solution.

3D effects are found to occur from four sources. First, the initial field can decisively affect the propagation 
pattern including how the waves spread in azimuth direction. Second, the θ -coupling terms (derivatives with respect 
to azimuth) in the governing equations and interface conditions reflect the constitutional properties of 3D wave 
propagation. Third, the environment, including the geometry and the acoustic parameters of the medium, has direct 
influence on the wave propagation path by reflection, refraction, and scattering. Hence a 3D environment will 
definitely induce 3D effects. Finally, 3D distributed boundaries will induce 3D effects as well. 
Although the irregular fluid/solid interface investigated in this dissertation is range-dependent, θ -variation is 
not considered in the formulation. As Fig. 2.1 shows, the second unit tangent vector ( ), ,r zs s sθs  is set to ( )0,1,0  
so that a cylindrical irregular interface is obtained. In other words, this interface is of axial symmetry and this is why 
it is drawn as a frustum of right circular cone in Fig. 2.1. This assumption is a serious drawback of the model since 
such interface will only reflect waves in fixed θ  planes, i.e., geometric θ -coupling at interface is ignored. To deal 
with a real 3D problem, the interface has to be generalized to include variation of bathymetry in θ  direction. For 
example, if the interface as shown in Fig. 2.1 is counterclockwise rotated an angle ϕ  respective to unit direction 
vector t , then three unit direction vectors are given by 
 
sin cos , sin , cos cos
cos , 0, sin .

Although a modified mathematical formulation and a novel numerical model for 3D fluid/solid coupled wave 
propagation problem considering irregular interface this dissertation has been developed and coded as a research 
prototype program C4PM, it is only a beginning for this challenging topic. There are several issues regarding 
mathematical and numerical enhancements to the modeling and theoretical completeness, namely, wide angle 
expansion in azimuth, proof of the energy-conserving property such as the proof for LSS wave equation given in Ref. 
[15]. Each of these issues can be a great improvement and validity proof of the proposed model.
