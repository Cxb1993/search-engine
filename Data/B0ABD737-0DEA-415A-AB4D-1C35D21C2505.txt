2Abstract
The phase behavior of mixtures containing supercritical carbon dioxide at elevated
pressures, including near critical region, and ultra-fine particle formation with
supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) method were investigated in this three-year project.
Within this period, we have conducted the measurements of vapor-liquid phase
boundaries for the binary or ternary mixtures of supercritical carbon dioxide + solvent +
cosolvent and supercritical carbon dioxide + solvent (ethanol or DMSO) + modifier
(water) at temperatures from 298 K to 348 K and pressures up to critical pressure. The
investigated systems contain carbon dioxide plus ethanol or DMSO (as a solvent) and
water (as a modifier) at temperatures from 298 K to 348 K and pressures up to 23 MPa.
From the experimental results, the phase diagrams can be obtained. The ultra-fine
particles were also prepared for proteins (such as-chymotrypsin, lysozyme) and
pharmaceutical materials (such as ceftazidime) with the SAS technique. This study fully
confirmed that the characteristics of the resultant particles from SAS process are closely
related to the vapor-liquid equilibrium behavior of the mixtures in the precipitator.
Keywords: high-pressure phase behavior, supercritical anti-solvent method, proteins,
pharmaceutical materials
4前言
利用超臨界流體製造高分子與生化物質微粒的方法(Reverchon, 1999; Jung and
Perrut, 2001)，主要有超臨界溶液快速膨脹(Rapid Expansion of Supercritical
Solutions, RESS)法與超臨界抗溶劑法(Supercritical Anti-Solvent, SAS)法。上述微粒
製備法均和超臨界流體、溶劑與溶質混合物的相行為有密切的關係。對於在超臨
界流體中之溶解度較高的溶質，較適合採用 RESS 法，此法無殘餘有機溶劑之虞，
但產率較低是其缺點；反之，在超臨界流體中之溶解度較低的溶質，則以 SAS 法
為宜，此法產率較高，但因須先以溶劑溶解溶質，產品中之殘餘溶劑需移除至一
可接受的程度。本計畫將以後者為研究的重點。
SAS 法製備微粒時，先得將溶質溶解於合適的溶劑中，然後在高壓下與超臨界
抗溶劑一起噴入晶析槽中，溶劑在槽中將迅速逸出，被抗溶劑攜走，溶質將因過
飽和而析出；文獻中使用此法製備高分子與生化物質的代表性案例分別列於表一
與表二。表中顯示不同溶質搭配不同的溶劑，製造所得微粒的外觀與平均粒徑可
能會有很大的差異。超臨界抗溶劑微粒製備法的重要操作變數包括：溫度、壓力、
噴嘴口徑、溶液的濃度、流速、溶劑等。Randolph et al. (1993)的高分子 PLLA 晶
析實驗，以兩種不同溶液噴入方式(毛細管噴嘴及具震盪表面之霧化噴嘴)，實驗條
件在近臨界區與臨界區，其實驗結果均顯示有相同的趨勢，亦即在較低但稍高於
二氧化碳臨界點之操作壓力下，能產生較小的顆粒；在超臨界區較高壓下，會形
成較大顆粒。他們推斷此一現象係基於低壓下二氧化碳的擴散係數大於高壓下之
擴散係數(McHugh and Krukonis, 1986)，導致低壓下二氧化碳與溶劑間之質傳效率
較高壓時為佳，因而在 SAS 製程中，質傳效率比噴射破裂(jet breakup)與流體水力
特性更形重要。Lengsfeld et al. (2000)曾以動態表面張力(dynamic surface tension)與
噴射破裂方程式(linear jet breakup equation)關聯噴射破裂長度(jet breakup length)。
當操作條件於均勻相的超臨界狀態時，表面張力驟降，噴射破裂長度亦驟減，以
致無法形成明顯的液滴，因此他們認為在 SAS 微粒形成機制中，應以氣相成核與
成長理論取代成核於不連續的液滴模式。Reverchon et al. (2003)則認為混合物的相
行為應為 SAS 製程的主要影響因素，透過視窗型晶析槽的觀察，他們發現當晶析
槽操作於混合物臨界壓力以上時，可製備次微米級顆粒；操作於汽液共存區時，
則將製得微米級顆粒；操作於次臨界氣相區時，一次粒子會聚集成氣泡狀
6式的狀態方程式中簡單的三次方(simple cubic type)狀態方程式最被廣泛應用，如
Soave－Redlich－Kwong (Soave, 1972)，Peng－Robinson (Peng and Robinson,
1976)，Patel－Teja (Patel and Teja, 1982)等。常用的混合律則有凡得瓦爾單一流體
混合律(van der Waals one－fluid mixing rule)，對於對稱型系統，通常可獲得合理的
結果。若系統為非對稱，且為極性物質，則較複雜的 local-composition mixing rule (Li
et al., 1985)，density-dependent mixing rule (Mohamed and Holder, 1987)，
density-dependent local composition mixing rule (Lee and Chao, 1989)，Wong and
Sandler mixing rule (Wong and Sandler, 1992)等混合律對於此類系統的描述可能較
佳。有關臨界區附近的相關研究，Leonhard and Kraska (1999)提出可描述氬、甲烷、
二氧化碳等純質，在高壓或近臨界區 PρT 行為的狀態方程式。Chaikunchuensakun
and Tanthapanichakoon (2003)利用 Peng-Robinson 狀態方程式結合 NRTL 活性係數
模式的 Wong-Sandler 和 modified Huron-Vidal 混合律，計算混合物的臨界點。Mi et
al. (2002) 考慮偶極之間的交互作用力，修正 SAFT 狀態方程式，並將其應用於描
述極性流體在臨界點附近的熱力學性質。Kiselev (1998)與 Kiselev and Friend (1999)
以 Patel-Tjea 狀態方程式為例，提出一種將傳統之狀態方程式轉換為 crossover 狀
態方程式的方法，使得此種模式在靠近臨界點附近轉變成 scaling laws 的近似，而
遠離臨界區則還原為原始之狀態方程式。近年來此法已被成功地擴展至 SAFT 狀
態方程式中(McCable and Kiselev, 2004a and b; Sun et al., 2005a and b)。採用
crossover 之處理方式可大幅改善傳統狀態方程式無法同時兼顧臨界區與遠離臨界
區相邊界計算之準確度的缺點。
研究目的
本研究在三年的期間，運用一套可變體積-附視窗暨攝影系統的高壓相平衡分析
裝置，量取由超臨界流體與溶劑或混合溶劑所組成之混合物的汽液相邊界，並觀
測其臨界現象。同時也使用一套超臨界抗溶劑微粒製備裝置，探討操作在溶劑+抗
溶劑混合物不同相區域，對於所製得之奈米級超細微粒之外觀與粒徑分布的影
響。本研究之微粒製造對象包括蛋白質、抗生素等，溶劑為對上述溶質溶解度較
高的純質或混合溶劑。研究結果可增進對溶劑+抗溶劑混合物之高壓相行為的了
解，尤其本研究所使用的相平衡分析儀，可準確量取臨界點附近的相邊界，對於
改善熱力模式在臨界區附近的準確度，相當有幫助。本系列研究的微粒製備實驗
8積之高壓釜中，由兩物質之進料體積，再經已知二氧化碳和溶劑/修飾劑在不
同壓力及溫度之密度值，求得釜內混合物的精確莫耳分率( xCO2 或 yCO2 )。
(4) 啟動攝影-錄影單元，高壓釜內相行為變化的整個過程可由電視螢幕上觀察。
(5) 開啟磁石攪拌器，高壓釜內的二氧化碳和溶劑/修飾劑混合物利用磁石攪拌以
促進均勻混合。釜內混合物之溫度藉由恆溫循環水控制在預定操作的溫度。
(6) 利用手動泵移動釜內活塞位置，改變釜內體積，系統壓力也隨之改變。此時
先將高壓釜內之混合物調整至處於單一均勻相的狀態。
(7) 在預定的操作溫度下，經由手動泵慢慢的向後退回釜內活塞，以增加釜內體
積，因而系統內壓力也隨之慢慢下降。降壓過程系統內溫度為一定值，攝影-
錄影系統可拍攝或紀錄高壓釜內混合物產生相變化的過程，透過影像系統，
觀察高壓釜內部混合物狀態的變化，直到另一個新的相(phase)出現。因降壓
過程，系統內溫度也會隨之下降，手動泵要慢慢移動，以保持系統溫度為一
定值。
(8) 操控手動泵增壓或降壓，反覆觀察相變化發生的過程至少重複三次，以確認
相變化發生時的壓力。
(9) 改變循環水槽溫度設定，重複(6)、(7)、(8)實驗步驟，以進行另一溫度下的相
邊界量測。
(10) 當完成同一組成的量測後，再一次利用注射式定量泵添加二氧化碳或溶劑/修
飾劑，以改變系統內混合物的莫耳分率( xCO2 或 yCO2 )，重複(6)、(7)、(8)、
(9)步驟以重取另一組成下的相邊界實驗數據。由於添加任一組成的操作方
式，可能會造成樣品之莫耳分率誤差的累積，為降低實驗誤差，此種添加進
料的操作只以一次為限。
(11) 實驗完畢後，將樣品抽出，利用液態二氧化碳和真空泵反覆清洗量測系統，
透過影像系統觀看是否殘留溶劑/修飾劑，直到系統內沒有殘留任何溶劑/修飾
劑，再利用液態二氧化碳和真空泵反覆清洗及抽真空至少三次。清洗乾淨後，
再進行另一新組成的量測。
10
氣體經降壓後導入分離槽(12)，由於低壓下溶劑在二氧化碳中的溶解度降低，溶劑
將從氣相物流中凝結出來，並匯集於分離槽中予以回收。二氧化碳與溶液之質量
流率、晶析槽之壓力與溫度等訊號，傳輸至電腦(7)，各種操作條件之顯示與控制
設定均透過電腦監視器之表單；晶析槽之壓力由預先設定之背壓調節噐(13)。當進
料溶液泵送完後，關閉此輸送泵(p2)，二氧化碳仍需持續饋入，以便將晶析槽中殘
餘的溶劑帶出。隨後關閉二氧化碳輸送泵(p1)，緩慢將晶析槽釋壓後，打開晶析槽
取出微粒樣品，以場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡(FESEM)觀察表面形態，再以影像處理
軟體計算一次粒子之粒徑分布及平均粒徑。
本研究選取蛋白質中之-chymotrypsin 與 lysozyme，以及抗生素 ceftazidime 為
探討的對象。
結果與討論
(a) 汽液相邊界之量測結果
本研究首先完成 PEA 裝置的測試與 CO2 +多種溶劑之雙成分汽液相邊界的量
測，相關之結果已發表於 Chiu et al. (2008a) (詳如附件一)。另外也完成常用於超臨
界抗溶劑造粒法之 CO2 + ethanol 與 CO2 + acetone 雙成分混合物系統的汽液相平衡
量測，研究成果已發表於 Chiu et al. (2008 b)中(詳如附件二)。本文主要以前述之
PEA 裝置量取 CO2 + ethanol 與 CO2 + acetone 之汽液相邊界，由實驗結果估計出與
各溫度相對應的臨界壓力與臨界組成。雖然文獻中此兩組雙成分之汽液相平衡數
據來源不少，但有很多數據不太一致，本研究將實驗所得之數據與不同文獻數據
逐一比較，並釐清數據不一致的疑點。另外也完成 CO2 + DMSO + ethanol 三成分
系統之量測，其中DMSO在SAS程序中擔任主要溶劑的角色，揮發性較高的 ethanol
則擔任助溶劑的角色，此助溶劑的加入可使 SAS 之後段的溶劑移除程序較為省
時。圖 3 為 DMSO/ethanol 在不同比例下之汽液相平衡圖，定溫下，臨界壓力隨
DMSO 比率的增加而升高。
本研究從超臨界抗溶劑法(SAS)製備超細微粒的實驗結果發現，當 SAS 法操作
於過熱蒸氣區時，可獲得微米或次微米級晶粒，此種尺度範圍正適合應用於吸入
式藥劑的調配。另一方面而言，以 SAS 法製備藥物物質微粒時，常使用乙醇或
DMSO 為溶劑；然而，CO2 與這些溶劑所組成之混合物系統的過熱蒸氣區極通常
12
晶析條件控制於(溶劑+抗溶劑)混合物的超臨界區，將可獲得奈米級微粒。在過熱
蒸汽區可製得微米或次微米級產品。在汽液兩相區則可能獲得大小粒徑差距極大
的微粒，甚至結成為一緻密膜片。有關此三種物質的超細微粒製造探討，其成果
已陸續發表於 SCI 國際知名期刊中，詳如附件二至附件四(Chang et al., 2008a, b, c)。
結論
(1) 本研究使用一部可變體積-附視窗暨影像處理系統的高壓相平衡分析裝置
(PEA)，採用合成法進行相邊界數據量測，共完成CO2 + ethanol、CO2 + acetone、
CO2 + DMSO + ethanol等混合物系統的汽液相邊界量測，壓力均高至臨界壓力
附近。
(2) 本研究同時也完成CO2 + ethanol + water與CO2 + acetone + water兩組三成分混
合物系統的汽液相邊界量測，每一等溫線之壓力也都高至臨界壓力附近。少
量水的加入，可顯著提昇臨界壓力，也可大幅擴增過熱蒸汽區的範圍。
(3) 本研究比較使用SRK、PR與PT狀態方程式配合MR-Q1與MR-Q2兩種不同的混
合律，分別關聯臨界區附近的汽液相邊界數據，並以驟沸計算訂定最適化交
互作用參數值。計算結果顯示各狀態方程式在使用雙交互作用參數混合律
MR-Q2的情況下，可顯著改善相邊界計算的準確度。整體而言，Peng-Robinson
狀態方程式結合MR-Q2混合律的計算結果較佳。
(4) 本研究完成以超臨界抗溶劑法(SAS)製備-chymotrypsin、lysozyme、ceftazidime
等超細微粒的探討，實驗結果與相圖相對照，可以證實由SAS程序所製得之微粒
的特性與晶析階段晶析槽中混合物之相行為有極密切的關係。因此，如先能有足
夠的相關混合物之相平衡數據，對調控SAS程序的操作條件極為關鍵。

generator (Model 62-6-10, High Pressure Equipment Co., USA)
equipped with a sapphire window (Part No. 742.0106, Bridgman
closure, SITEC, Switzerland), a rupture disk and a circulation
jacket. The internal volume of the cell can be adjusted manually
from 35 cm3 to 60 cm3 with a piston screw pump and the cell is
operable up to 50 MPa and 473.15 K. The cell’s temperature was
controlled by circulated thermostatic water and was measured
by an inserted thermocouple, whose reading has been cali-
brated to within an uncertainty of ±0.1 K. A pressure transducer
(PDCR 407-01, Druck, UK) with a digital display (DPI 280,
Druck, UK) measured the cell’s pressure to within an uncertainty
of ±0.04%.
The operation procedure is described as follows. The empty
cell was purged several times with carbon dioxide to remove the
entrapped air. After evacuating the cell, two precision syringe
pumps (Model: 260D, Isco Inc., USA) were employed to charge
carbon dioxide and organic compounds, respectively. The loaded
mixture in the cell was compressed to the desired pressure by
displacing movable piston fitted within the cell. A magnetic stir
bar was placed inside the cell to promote the mixing of the mix-
ture. The weight of each loaded material was calculated from the
known charged volume (accurate to ±0.01 cm3) and its density
at pre-specified pressure and temperature. While the densities of
carbon dioxide were taken from the NIST Chemistry WebBook
[14], the densities of the organic liquids were determined exper-
imentally by a high-pressure densitometer (DMA 512P, Anton
Paar, Austria) with an oscillation period indicator (DMA 48,
Anton Paar, Austria) to an uncertainty of ±0.0001 g/cm3. The
uncertainty of the composition of the prepared mixtures was
estimated to be ±0.003 in mole fraction. The phase behavior
of the loaded mixture in the cell was observed with an aid of
a digital camera (Model: DSC-F88/S, Sony, Japan), LED-white
light, and a television (Model: PV-C2062, Panasonic, Japan).
The loaded sample was compressed to form a single phase at
a fixed temperature, and the mixture was maintained homoge-
neously at least 20 min. The pressure was then slowly decreased
until the second phase appeared by manipulating manually the
position of piston screw pump. The uncertainty of the observed
phase transition pressures was estimated to be ±0.02 MPa. In
case of a small bubble appeared in the cell, a bubble point was
obtained. A dew point was determined upon a fine mist droplet
existing in the cell. Moreover, critical pressure was found as
critical opalescence was observed during the phase transition
process.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Phase transition near critical region
Three kinds of phase transition behavior were observed in
the different phase boundary regions, including bubble, dew,
and near critical points. It is worthy to note the phenomenon of
phase transition passing through the vapor–liquid phase bound-
ary near the critical region. Fig. 2 presents an example of CO2
(1) + 1-octanol (2) mixture at 348.15 K with 0.9076 in the mole
fraction of CO2. At 18.47 MPa, the mixture existed as a single
phase. The mixture changed from colorless to golden transpar-
ent as pressure was decreased to 18.42 MPa, and then it became
darker and darker as pressure kept decreasing. When the pres-

CO2 + PGMEA, indicating that the critical points were located
in the carbon dioxide-rich regions, where the mole fractions of
carbon dioxide are greater than 0.9. Fig. 6 illustrates the isother-
mal phase boundaries varying with the composition of carbon
dioxide for CO2 + quinoline. It is clearly shows that the bubble
pressures increase dramatically as the mole fractions of carbon
dioxide change from 0.65 to 0.70, especially at temperatures
lower than 318.15 K.
Since the experimental conditions cover the entire critical
region, the critical point at a given temperature can be estimated
from the maximum pressure of the isothermal vapor–liquid
phase boundary by interpolation. The estimated results are
reported in Table 6. For CO2 + 1-octanol and CO2 + quinoline,
their critical compositions are insensitive to temperature over
the experimental conditions.

These tabulated values show that the mixing rules are more
influential than the EOS on the quality of phase equilibrium cal-
culations. Only the calculated results from the Peng–Robinson
EOS are thus presented in the following graphical comparisons.
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate that the MR-Q1 mixing rule often fails
to accurately correlate the VLE data near critical region, and
the MR-Q2 may improve the presentation of the phase bound-
aries. Fig. 5 shows that reasonable correlations were obtained
for the mixtures at 318.15 K and 338.15 K, whereas overesti-
mations are obvious for the phase boundary at 358.15 K. Fig. 6
indicates that significant deviations were exhibited in the system
for the mixtures of CO2 + quinoline, especially around the crit-
ical regions and in the vapor phase. More complicated mixing
rules may be necessary to improve the presentation of the phase
behavior.
4. Conclusions
The vapor–liquid phase transition phenomena have been
observed for CO2 + 1-octanol system in a temperature range of
313.15–348.15 K by using a new visual and volume-variable
high-pressure phase equilibrium analyzer. Different transition
phenomena were observed when the experiments were con-
ducted in bubble point, dew point, and near critical point regions.
The PEA apparatus was also successfully employed to mea-
sure the vapor–liquid phase boundaries for CO2 + 1-octanol,
CO2 + DMSO, CO2 + PGMEA, and CO2 + quinoline at temper-
atures from 313.15 K to 358.15 K and up to critical pressures.
The critical points have been determined by interpolation of the
measured phase boundary data. The new vapor–liquid equilib-
rium data were correlated with the Soave, the Peng–Robinson,
and the Patel–Teja equations of state by using the van der
Waals one-fluid mixing rules with one adjustable parameter
and with two adjustable parameters. The capabilities of these
three cubic equations of state are quite similar when the same
mixing rule was utilized. In general, the use of two-parameter
mixing rule significantly improved the representation for the
phase boundaries, especially near critical region. However, more
sophisticated models may be necessary to quantitatively corre-
late the phase envelopes over wide temperature and pressure
ranges.

Experimental Section
Materials. Carbon dioxide (purity of 99.5+ %) was purchased
from Liu-Hsiang Co. (Taiwan), acetone, halocarbons free grade
(99.9 %), from Arcos (USA), and ethanol, HPLC grade (99.99
%), from Fisher Scientific (USA). All the chemicals were used
without further purification. The physical properties of these
compounds are listed in Table 2.
Apparatus. The schematic diagram and operation procedure
of the visual and volume-variable PEA have been given in
detail elsewhere.37 This apparatus consists of a high-pressure
generator (model 62-6-10, High Pressure Equipment Co.,
USA) equipped with a sapphire window (Part No. 742.0106,
Bridgman closure, SITEC, Switzerland), a rupture disk, and
a circulation jacket. The visualized cell is operable up to 50
MPa and 473.15 K. The cell’s temperature was controlled
by circulated thermostatic water and measured by an inserted
thermocouple, whose reading has been calibrated to within
an uncertainty of 0.1 K. A pressure transducer (PDCR 407-
01, Druck, UK) with a digital display (DPI 280, Druck, UK)
measured the cell’s pressure to within an uncertainty of 0.04
%. Each component was charged individually into the cell
by a precision syringe pump (model: 260D, Isco Inc., USA).
The weight of each loaded substance was calculated from
the known charged volume and its density at charging
pressure and temperature. The charged volumes were read
from the control panel of the syringe pumps which are
accurate to 0.01 cm3. While the densities of carbon dioxide
were taken from the NIST Chemistry WebBook,38 the
densities of the pure organic liquids were determined
experimentally in our research laboratory by a high-pressure
densitometer (DMA 512P, Anton Paar, Austria) with an
oscillation period indicator (DMA 48, Anton Paar, Austria)
to an uncertainty of 0.0001 g · cm-3. The uncertainty of the
composition of the loaded mixtures was estimated to be 0.003
in mole fraction. The phase behavior of the mixture in the
cell was observed with the aid of a digital camera, LED-
white light, and a television. The loaded sample was
compressed to form a single phase at a fixed temperature,
and pressure was then slowly decreased until the second phase
appeared by manipulating manually the position of the piston
in the high-pressure generator. The uncertainty of the
observed phase transition pressures was estimated to be 0.02
MPa. In our previous paper,37 the VLE data of CO2 +
1-octanol have been measured and compared with the data

As mentioned earlier, one of the main objectives of this study
is to clarify the inconsistent VLE data reported by different
investigators for CO2 + ethanol and CO2 + acetone. Figures

since then various related articles have been reported up to date
[10–12]. Supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) precipitation method
possesses great potential to produce solvent-free, ultra-fine par-
ticulates and micro-capsules of pharmaceutical materials in
polymer matrix for controlled release systems. Moreover, the
selection of organic solvent is more flexible for the particle
formation process and the use of supercritical carbon diox-
ide as anti-solvent to precipitate proteins causes less damage
to their biological activity due to the mild precipitation condi-
tions.
-Chymotrypsin is an arsenal of enzymes and it works like
a scissor to chop up proteins next to phenylalanine and other
large amino acids. In the present study, -chymotrypsin was
chosen as a model protein to reduce its particle size for the
demand of the pulmonary delivery system. The main objective
of this study is to investigate the influence of phase behavior
on the morphology of resulting particles prepared by the SAS
technique. The experiments were conducted over the precipita-
tion pressures up to 25 MPa and temperatures in the range of
308.2–348.2 K. Moreover, the effects of the inside diameter of
capillary in the coaxial injector and the concentration of pro-
tein in the feed on the PSD were also investigated. Since the
importance of phase behavior in the SAS precipitation [13–15],
the vapor–liquid phase boundaries of binary system containing
solvent + anti-solvent (DMSO + CO2) at the temperatures from
318.15 to 348.15 K over a wide range of pressures were also
measured by our research group with a volume-variable phase
equilibrium analyzer [16]. The morphology of the particulate
samples was observed with a high resolution scanning electron
microscope, and the crystalline and the thermal property of the
samples after the SAS treatment were analyzed with WAXS,
DSC and TGA, respectively. The concentrations of fluid mix-
tures in precipitator at the end of injection of protein solution
were estimated by a simple CSTR model and mapping the pre-
cipitation loci onto the phase diagram of DMSO + CO2 to make a
comparison of the resultant particles prepared in different phase
regions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Apparatus and procedure
An SAS apparatus (model: SAS 200, Thar Technologies Co.,
USA) was used, in the present study, to prepare ultra-fine parti-
cles of -chymotrypsin. Fig. 1 illustrates the schematic diagram
of the apparatus, in which the injection device has been replaced
by a coaxial injector (9). The detailed description of the appara-
tus and the operation procedure has been given elsewhere [17].
Carbon dioxide (1) was liquefied with a cooler (3) and continu-
ously introduced into the precipitation vessel (10) via the outer
part of the coaxial injector by a high-pressure liquid pump (11,
P1). Before entering the injector, the stream of carbon dioxide
was heated by a pre-heater (6). Temperature in the precipitator
was regulated to a pre-specified level by a heating jacket (8).
While a steady-state was achieved, protein solution at a given
flow rate was charged by another high pressure pump (11, P2)
and injected into the precipitation vessel through a PEEK cap-
illary tube (Victrex, UK), an insert of the coaxial injector, and
carbon dioxide was fed simultaneously at a constant flow rate of
30 g/min (4). The protein particles were formed in the precipi-
tator during the solution droplets contacting with supercritical
carbon dioxide. After the completion of injection of protein solu-
tion, carbon dioxide was continuously delivered for about 2–3 h
to remove the residual solvent in the precipitator. The precipi-
tation vessel was then depressurized gradually to atmospheric
pressure. Finally, the resultant particles were collected from the
inside of the precipitator for further characterization analysis.
2.2. Materials
-Chymotrypsin made from bovine pancreas (molecular
weight: 25 kDa) was supplied by Sigma–Aldrich, USA, and
the morphology of the received lyophilized powders is irregular
plate-like micro-particles. DMSO (purity of 99.9%, spectropho-
tometric grade, Acros Organic, USA) was used as a solvent

-chymotrypsin in DMSO (C) and 5 g/min of the flow rate
of protein solution (F). According to the VLE phase diagram
of DMSO + CO2 [20,21], a homogeneous supercritical state of
mixtures was formed in the precipitator under these precipitation
conditions. Fig. 2 illustrates the PSD of the particulate sam-
ples obtained by using three different sizes of capillary tubes,
indicating that the narrowest PSD and the finest particles were
produced as the smallest size of capillary tube (127m) was
used. Under this condition, the mean size of the resultant pri-
mary particles is about 57 nm. This trend is consistent with the
observations by Wu et al. [14] for the preparation of pigment Red
177 nano-particles. Under other precipitation pressures and tem-
peratures (runs #1 and #7, and runs #3 and #13), similar trends
were observed. It could be attributed to the fact that the finer
liquid droplets of protein solution were generated through the
smaller sizes of capillary tube, and then the smaller protein parti-
cles were precipitated. The coaxial injection with a capillary tube
of 127m inside diameter was thus used in all the rest of runs.
3.2.2. Effect of precipitation pressure and temperature
In the runs of #5 to #20, the experiments were conducted at
different precipitation pressures, from 7 to 25 MPa, for investi-
gating the pressure effect on the resulting particles. During this
series of experiments, precipitation temperatures were main-
tained at 308.2, 318.2, or 328.2 K and all the other operating
parameters were also kept at the same conditions. As seen from
the VLE phase envelopes of DMSO + CO2 system [20,21], the
critical pressure was estimated to be about 8 MPa at 308.2 K,
10 MPa at 318.2 K, and 12.7 MPa at 328.2 K, respectively.
The FESEM images of the particulate samples produced at
different precipitation pressures are given in Figs. 3 and 4.
As illustrated in Figs. 3(a) and 4(a), both dense cake and
spherical clusters of primary particles were obtained when
the precipitations were conducted in the vapor–liquid coex-
istence region. As the precipitations were operated near the
critical region, Figs. 3(b) and 4(b) show that dense cake
disappeared while aggregated sub-micro- or micro-metric of
clusters were formed. When the precipitation pressures were
higher than the critical pressures, Figs. 3(c) and 4(c) reveal
that networked nano-particles with narrow PSD were pro-
duced. Moreover, it appears that the mean sizes of the primary
particles are insensitive to precipitation pressure if the oper-
ating pressures were well above the corresponding critical
value.

seen from this figure, larger sizes of particles were formed and
also the uniformity became worse as precipitations were oper-
ated at higher temperatures. It is clearly shown that the phase
behavior of mixtures at precipitation stage is one of crucial fac-
tors to govern the morphology of the resultant particles from
the SAS processes. Furthermore, the recovery yield of particu-
late samples was also dependent on the phase regions, where the
precipitation condition was located. Higher yields, ranging from
70 to 90%, were obtained as the precipitations were conducted
in the homogenous supercritical or superheated vapor region,
while the yields were as low as about 45% as the particles were
formed in the vapor–liquid coexistence region.
3.2.3. Effect of α-chymotrypsin concentration in the feed
Five experimental runs (#8 and #24 to #27) were made under
different concentrations of -chymotrypsin in DMSO, ranging
from 0.25 wt% to 2 wt%, together with F = 5 g/min, T = 308.2 K,
and P = 15 MPa (corresponding to supercritical state). Fig. 7
depicts the PSD of the primary particles produced from different
protein concentrations. It indicates that the PSD are insensitive
to protein concentration as the concentrations are lower than
0.5 wt%. However, the PSD become broader as the concentra-
tions are greater than 0.5 wt% and the mean size of samples
seems to increase with increasing the concentration of protein.
It should also be noted that the feed rate of protein solution is a
minor process variable for the mean size of resultant particles, as
seen from a comparison of run #8 with run #28. Similar results
have been concluded from our previous study on the polymeric
particles formation of mCOC [17].
3.3. Physicochemical characterization
The thermal property of -chymotrypsin samples was mea-
sured with DSC. Fig. 8 shows that similar thermal histograms
were recorded from the raw substance as received and the sam-
ples after SAS processing, and a very small endothermic peak
appeared at about 364 K. The TGA was used to check the thermal
stability of the protein. Fig. 9 presents the TGA patterns from
313 to 1113 K for the raw material and the representative SAS-
prepared samples. This graph shows that water contents were
slightly decreased after SAS processing, and the onset temper-
atures of decomposition were almost the same, around 493 K,
for these three samples.
The molecular structures of the protein were examined with
FTIR. Fig. 10 compares the FTIR pattern of the raw protein with
those of the samples prepared by SAS process under various
operating conditions. No significant differences were observed
between these four patterns, and the graph also shows that no

residual DMSO solvent was detected from the SAS-prepared
samples. XRD measurements were also performed to deter-
mine the crystallinity of particulate samples. The diffractograms
reveal that both the untreated -chymotrypsin and the processed
samples are completely amorphous.
3.4. Biological activity
Fig. 11 presents the results of the biological activity (BA)
assays for several representative -chymotrypsin samples. The

BA can be calculated from Eq. (1), and the SAS processed sam-
ples recovered activity to range between 30 and 75% of the BA
relative to the original protein. Relatively higher retentions of BA
were found as the samples were precipitated in the homogenous
supercritical or superheated vapor region.
3.5. Mathematical modeling
In our recent study [22], the compositions of mixtures
in precipitator at the end of injection of pigment solution

Fig. 15. FESEM images of -chymotrypsin particulate samples prepared from different phase regions.
experimental results from Refs. [20,21] were also presented in
the graphs. The particle precipitation was conducted in the super-
critical region when the point ofx0CO2 is well above the horizontal
dashed line, including runs #7 to #9 (in Fig. 12), #12 to #14 (in
Fig. 13), and #18 to #20 (in Fig. 14). Run #6 (in Fig. 12) and run
#11 (in Fig. 13) were operated near the corresponding critical
regions. In case of a point under the horizontal critical pres-
sure line and located on the right hand side of the VLE phase
boundary, such as run #17 (in Fig. 14), the SAS procedure was
implemented in the superheated vapor region. The mixtures were
crossing the two-phase boundary during the precipitation stage
if the point located in the vapor–liquid coexistence region, such
as runs #5 (in Fig. 12), #10 (in Fig. 13), #15, and #16 (in Fig. 14).
Although the estimated minimum mole fraction of carbon diox-
ide of run #11 is near the critical pressure, but the morphology
of the samples is similar to run #17 (located in the superheated
vapor region). As noted by Reverchon et al. [24], the presence of
solute may induce a change of phase behavior of binary system
and lead to increasing the mixture’s critical pressure. There-
fore, the precipitation pressure of run #11 may be lower than
the actual critical pressure of the ternary system and thus this
run was actually operated in the superheated region. Fig. 15
depicts the morphology of the particulate -chymotrypsin sam-
ples prepared from different phase regions: in the vapor–liquid
coexistence region (run #5); near the critical region (run #6); in
the superheated vapor region (run #17); and in the homogenous
supercritical region (run #14). It is apparent that the morphology
and the PSD of the resultant samples have a strong correlation
with the phase regions where the points of x0CO2 were located in.
4. Conclusions
Ultra-fine particles of a model compound of proteins, -
chymotrypsin, were successfully prepared via the SAS apparatus
by using DMSO as a solvent and carbon dioxide as an anti-
solvent. A series of systematic experimental runs have been
made to investigate the effects of several precipitation parame-
ters on the particulate samples. The experimental results clearly
showed that the phase behavior of mixtures in precipitator, dur-
ing the precipitation stage, was one of crucial factors governing
the morphology and the PSD of the resultant particles pro-
duced from the SAS process. As evidenced from experimental
results, uniform networked nano-particles were obtained when
the precipitation stage was operated in supercritical region. The
uniformity of the resulting products became worse when the
particles were precipitated near the critical region. Irregular
micro-scale aggregated particles were formed in the superheated
vapor region, while both dense cake and spherical clusters were
produced in the vapor–liquid coexistence region. According to
the XRD, the DSC and the TGA analyses, no significant changes
were found with respect to the degree of crystallinity and thermal
stability of proteins after the SAS processing. Also, the bio-
logical activities of the resultant -chymotrypsin were reduced
by 25–70% after the SAS treatment. A simple CSTR model
was capable of estimating the concentration variations of the
mixtures in precipitator during the SAS process, and the cal-
culated results were generally consistent with the experimental
observations.

Abstract
Ultra-fine particles of protein lysozyme were prepared with a supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) apparatus by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as solvent and carbon dioxide as anti-solvent. The influences of various experimental factors on the morphology and the mean size of particulate
products were investigated. As evidenced from the experimental results, phase behavior of the mixtures in precipitator during the particle formation
stage played a crucial role in the SAS processes. Uniform networked nano-particles were obtained when the precipitations were conducted in the
supercritical region of carbon dioxide + DMSO mixture. Several different types of morphologies were produced simultaneously as the precipitations
were operated near the critical region. Spherical micron-scale clusters were formed in the superheated vapor region, while submicron-particles
were aggregated as dense cake when lysozyme precipitated in the vapor–liquid coexistence region. The wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
patterns indicated that both the raw lysozyme and the processed particulate samples were amorphous. The differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC) thermograms showed that the dehydration peak was disappeared after SAS treatment. Moreover, the networked primary particles could
be disintegrated and dispersed well in water through ultrasonication, which were confirmed by analysis with dynamic laser scattering (DLS). A
continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model was used to calculate the dynamic composition variations of the mixtures in precipitator during the
particle formation period.

1. Introduction
In the past few decades, various micronization methods have
been developed to produce ultra-fine particles for many appli-
cations. The traditional micronization methods, such as milling,
grinding, sol–gel, and spray drying, have certain inherent lim-
itations in particle formations for proteins and pharmaceutical
compounds. For example, denaturation or degradation of par-
ticulate products may occur due to appreciable heat of friction
being released during the processing, unacceptably high lev-
els of residual solvents left in the particles, or the resultant
products having broad particle size distribution (PSD) [1,2].
Supercritical fluid-assisted micronization processes are viable
alternatives since these techniques are capable of overcoming the
drawbacks of the conventional processes as mentioned above.

These innovative methods include the rapid expansion of super-
critical solutions (RESS) [3], the particles from gas-saturated
solutions (PGSS) [4], the supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) [5],
the supercritical-assisted atomization (SAA) [6], and the carbon
dioxide-assisted nebulization with a bubble dryer® (CAN-BD)
[7]. Among several others, Jung and Perrut [8], Vemavarapu et
al. [9], and Reverchon and Adami [10] extensively surveyed the
available articles and patents for the particle formations with the
supercritical fluid technologies.
Recently, therapeutic proteins and peptides have received a
great attention for the treatment of many diseases [11]. Fine
particles with uniform size, ranging from 1m to 5m, are
essential to the applications for pulmonary delivery and con-
trolled release systems [12]. Proteins are often stored as dry
powders to improve the long-term stability since the chemical
and the physical degradations are facilitated by water contents in
products [13]. Typically, the purposes of proteins micronization
are to reduce necessary drug dose, to enhance bioavailability, or
to build precise drug delivery systems.

The PSD of particulate samples were also measured with
DLS particle size analyzer (Model: ZEN3690, Malvern Instru-
ments Ltd., UK). A standard sample (3060, NanosphereTM Size
Standards, certified mean diameter = 60 ± 2.7 nm, Duke Sci-
entific Co., USA) was used to calibrate the outputs of DLS.

An appropriate amount of lysozyme particles was dispersed in
deionized water, and the suspension solution was treated with
ultrasonication (Model: D150H, Delta New Instrument Co., Tai-
wan) before analysis. The DLS measurements were conducted
at 298 K and three replications were made for each particulate
sample.
3. Results and discussion
The SAS apparatus, as mentioned above, was used in the
present study to produce ultra-fine particles of lysozyme by
using DMSO as a solvent and carbon dioxide as an anti-
solvent. The precipitation conditions and the corresponding
results were listed in Table 1. The influences of several pro-
cess parameters on the morphology and the mean size of
the particulate samples were investigated. These parameters
included the inside diameter of capillary tube, the precipi-
tation pressure (P) and temperature (T), and the lysozyme
concentration (C). The experimental results are discussed as
follows.
3.1. Phase diagram of solvent/anti-solvent mixtures
According to our previous studies on particle formation of
metallocene-catalyzed cyclic olefin copolymer (mCOC) via the
420 S.-C. Chang et al. / Chemical Engineering Journal 139 (2008) 416–425
tion of protein solution (x0CO2 ). As a representative illustration,
the values of x0CO2 were marked in Fig. 4 for several precipitation
runs which were conducted at 308.2 K. In this graph, the solid
curve refers to the VLE phase boundaries of DMSO + CO2, SC
means supercritical region, and V + L represents vapor–liquid
coexistence region. The particles were formed in the supercrit-
ical region when the point of x0CO2 was located well above the
mixture critical point (MCP). Runs #1, #3–7, #11–13 were all
made in the homogeneous supercritical phase region. While run
#8 was operated near the critical region, the dynamic concen-
tration loci of runs #2 and #10 were starting from superheated
vapor region, passing through the phase boundary, and ending in
the vapor–liquid coexistence region at the end of solution injec-
tion period. Run #9 is a special case in this series of experiments
whose precipitation pressure, 10 MPa, is below the correspond-
ing critical pressure (12.7 MPa at 328.2 K). However, its x0CO2
value, about 0.9965, is still greater than the corresponding
dew-point composition, about 0.99. This run should be oper-
ated in the superheated vapor region through the precipitation
period.
3.2. Effect of the inside diameter of capillary tube
Two different sizes of capillary tube (508m and 254m)
were tested at the same operating conditions (run #1 and
run #6 as listed in Table 1). These two runs were conducted
at pressure (15 MPa) well above the MCP (about 8 MPa at
308.2 K), in which the mixtures in the precipitator formed a
homogenous supercritical state according to the vapor–liquid
equilibrium phase diagram (Fig. 3). Additionally, the concentra-
tion of lysozyme in DMSO was fixed at 0.7 wt% and the injection
rate of lysozyme solution (F) was maintained at 5 g/min. The
particulate samples obtained from runs #1 and #6 are compared
in Fig. 5, where the FESEM images were taken at the same
magnification. While larger particles (mean size of 91 nm for
the primary particles) with serious aggregation were obtained
by using 508m capillary tube (run #1, Fig. 5(a)), smaller
spherical primary nano-particles (mean size of 74 nm) with less
agglomeration were produced by using 254m capillary tube
(run #6, Fig. 5(b)). It was suggested that the smaller inside
diameters of capillary tube could effectively atomize the solu-
tion to form the finer droplets [30,31]. This trend is consistent
with the observations of the preparation of pigment particles
by Wu et al. [32]. Therefore, the capillary tube with inside
diameter of 254m was adopted in the rest of the precipitation
experiments.
3.3. Effect of the precipitation pressure
The influence of the precipitation pressure on the morphol-
ogy and the mean size of resulting particles were studied in a
range of 7–20 MPa. In the series of runs (from runs #2 to #7),
the temperature was maintained at 308.2 K and all the other
operating parameters were also kept at the same levels. Fig. 6
shows the FESEM images for the particulate samples taken from
different precipitation pressures. Fig. 6(a) depicts that agglom-

diameters of capillary tube: (a) 508m and (b) 254m.
eration of submicron primary particles (mean size of 189 nm)
with broad distribution was obtained as the precipitation was
implemented in the vapor–liquid coexistence region of carbon
dioxide + DMSO (at 7 MPa and 308.2 K). When the precipita-
tion pressures were in the range of 8.5–12 MPa, slightly higher
than the critical pressure of carbon dioxide + DMSO at 308.2 K,
fused irregular nano-particles were produced as illustrated in
Fig. 6(b) and (c). As shown in Figs. 5(b) and 6(d), spherical
networked nano-particles were obtained when the precipitation
pressures were higher than 15 MPa. Similar to the particle for-
mation of -chymotrypsin [33,34], the mean sizes of particulate
samples became insensitive to pressure while the operating pres-
sures were sufficiently higher than the corresponding critical
pressure.
3.4. Effect of the precipitation temperature
The effect of the precipitation temperature on the resultant
particles was observed at temperatures ranging from 308.2 K

the injection rate of lysozyme solutions was manipulated at
5 g/min. Fig. 9 shows the mean size and the standard devia-
tion of the resultant primary particles varying with lysozyme
concentration. It indicates that the mean size of the particu-
late products is relatively insensitive to lysozyme concentration,
when the particles were prepared in the supercritical region.
This finding is consistent with the observations of the parti-
cles formation for insulin by Yeo et al. [14]. Bustami et al.
[16] reported that the smaller mean sizes of resultant parti-
cles with less degree of agglomeration were obtained from the
higher concentrations of protein solutions, whereas our previ-
ous study on -chymotrypsin indicated that the mean size of
particle samples increased with increasing the concentration of
the protein in DMSO [33,34]. The discrepant trends observed
from various protein-containing systems may be attributable
to the different sensitivities on the changes of phase transi-
tion boundaries for the mixtures of carbon dioxide + DMSO
in the presence of the third component. Reverchon et al. [22]
investigated the phase behavior of CO2 + DMSO + YAc ternary
system with a visual cell during the precipitation stage. They

4. Conclusions
A model protein lysozyme was successfully micronized to
ultra-fine particles via the SAS process with DMSO as a sol-
vent and carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. The effects of the
size of capillary tube, the precipitation pressure and tempera-
ture, and the lysozyme concentration, on the morphology and
the mean size of particulate samples have been investigated. It
was found that using smaller size of injection capillary tube was
favorable to reduce the mean size of the resultant particles. As
also evidenced from the experimental results, the phase behav-
ior of mixtures in the precipitator during the precipitation stage
should be one of the crucial factors to control the morphology
and the PSD of the particulate products in the SAS process.
Fig. 13 illustrates the FESEM images of the particulate samples
obtained from different phase regions. As seen from this graph,
uniform networked nano-particles were produced as the pre-
cipitation was implemented in the supercritical region. Various
types of morphologies of the resulting products were exhibited
when the precipitation was made around the near critical region.
Spherical micron-metric clusters were formed in the superheated
vapor region, while sub-micrometric particles were aggregated
as a dense cake on the surface of the filter when the precipitation
conditions were manipulated in the vapor–liquid coexistence
region. While the DSC thermograms indicated that water content
in the original lysozyme was removed through the SAS process,
the XRD patterns revealed that both the original lysozyme and
the samples after SAS processing were completely amorphous.
Additionally, the mean size of particulate sample dispersed in
pure water measured with DLS was qualitatively consistent with
that of the primary particles determined from FESEM image. It
means that the aggregated primary nano-particles prepared from
the SAS process can be disintegrated and dispersed in water by
ultrasonication.

Nano- and microparticles of ceftazidime were prepared via a supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process. The
influences of various processing parameters on the characteristics of the resultant particles were investigated.
The experimental results revealed that the product’s morphology closely correlated with the phase behavior
of the mixtures in the precipitator during particle formation stage. Networked nanospheroids with narrow
particle size distribution were produced when the precipitation was operated in either the compressed liquid
region or in the supercritical region. However, the particulate products became less uniform as the precipitation
was implemented near the critical region. While microspheroids were obtained as the precipitation was
conducted in the superheated vapor region, dense films together with microparticles were formed in the
vapor-liquid coexistence region. The untreated ceftazidime and the SAS precipitated samples were
characterized with wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), a
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR). The analysis
results indicated that the SAS-processed particles were amorphous and the water content was markedly reduced.
Moreover, the molecular structure was still retained after the SAS processing.
1. Introduction
In medical or pharmaceutical applications, a major issue in
the drug formulation is how to reach an acceptable bioavail-
ability. More than one-third of the active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs) listed in the United States Pharmacopeia
(USP) are regarded as poorly water-soluble or water-insoluble
drugs.1 The very low solubility of drugs leads to a low
bioavailability, which causes a major problem in providing
accurate dosage formulations, and even delays or totally hinders
the development of new drugs. The conventional formulation
methods for these categories of drugs are the dissolution in
pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents or in aqueous
solutions with proper pH or the use of some detergents as
solubilizing agents.2,3 Nevertheless, such methods may increase
the toxicities of products and deteriorate the bioavailability due
to the residual solvents.
In the past few decades, a supercritical antisolvent (SAS)
micronization technique has received considerable attention to
generate ultrafine particles with prespecified characteristics for
a wide variety of materials, particularly for pharmaceutical
substances.4–9 This new material processing technique is a viable
alternative to avoid the drawbacks of the traditional formulations
as mentioned above since this method can improve the
therapeutic efficiency, enhance the bioavailability, and increase
the dissolution rate due to the increase of specific surface area.
Also, the drug administration route can be manipulated via the
reduction of particle size. Although the demand for size scale
of pharmaceutically active ingredients depends closely on the
kinds of administrations, the particle sizes should be in the range
of 100 to 300 nm for intravenous delivery, 1 to 5 µm for aerosol
pulmonary delivery, and 0.1 to 100 µm for the oral route.10 As
a consequence, how to control the mean size and the particle
size distribution (PSD) of the resultant products from the SAS
process is particularly important in this technology development.
In recent years, several research groups11–18 suggested that the
phase behavior of the mixtures during the particle formation
stage played a curial role in the SAS processing. The morphol-
ogy and mean size of the resultant particles are closely related
to the phase region where the precipitation was conducted.
Ceftazidime, a -lactam antibiotic, was selected as a model
compound in the present study. This pharmaceutical material
is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that has a broad
spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative
infections. The goal of this study is to verify the feasibility of
preparing ultrafine ceftazidime particles by using the SAS
method and to find out how to manipulate the process parameters
for controlling the morphology and the mean size of the resultant
ceftazidime particles. The effects of several process parameters
on the characteristics of precipitated samples were investigated.
These parameters included the inside diameter of the injection
capillary tube, precipitation pressure and temperature, the solute
concentration in the feed stream, and the flow rate of injected
solution. Different solvent media, including N,N-dimethylfor-
mamide (DMF), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), and mixtures of DMSO and ethanol, were
also tested. The micronization experiments in the present study
were conducted at pressures up to 25 MPa and temperatures
ranging from 298.2 to 338.2 K. A field emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM) was employed to observe the
morphology of the collected particulate samples, and the
physicochemical characterizations were determined with WAXS,
DSC, TGA, and FTIR.

3.1. VLE Phase Boundaries of the CO2 + DMSO +
Ethanol System. The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) phase
diagram of solvent/antisolvent systems provides us with sup-
porting information to identify the phase state of the mixtures
in the precipitator during the particle formation stage. It is
helpful in controlling the morphology and the mean size of
resulting particles by manipulating the precipitation conditions.
For ceftazidiem, DMSO is a good solvent but is difficult to
remove from the resulting particles due to its low volatility. To
improve the removal of residual solvent, ethanol was added as
a modifier. In the major part of this study, the mixtures of
DMSO and ethanol with different molar ratios were used as

samples are quite the same (about 42 to 46 nm), but the PSD
becomes narrower as smaller capillary tubes were adopted. The
coaxial injector equipped with a 63.5 µm inside diameter
capillary tube was thus used through all the runs, except for
runs 1 and 2.
3.2.2. Effects of Precipitation Pressure. The influence of
precipitation pressure was observed in the range of 7 to 20 MPa
at 308.2 K, from runs 3 to 10. As mentioned above, the critical
pressure of the solute-free system at 308.2 K is about 7.9 MPa.
As the precipitating pressures were lower than this value, such

from 1 to 15 mg/cm3. Also, the feed rate of the solution seems
not to affect the morphology and the mean size as the
precipitations were conducted in the same phase region, by a
comparison of run 18 with run 7. Uniform networked nano-
spheroids with a mean size of 40 nm were generated from these
two runs.
3.2.5. Effect of the Nature of Organic SolWents. Two more
different molar ratios of DMSO/EtOH mixed solvents (5:5 and
7:3) and three pure solvents (DMSO, NMP, and DMF) were
further used, respectively, to investigate the effect of solvents
on the characteristics of the final products. As indicated in Table
1, the precipitating conditions of runs 19 (DMSO/EtOH ) 5:5),
24 (DMSO/EtOH ) 7:3), and 29 (pure DMSO) were at 7 MPa
and 308.2 K. Accordingly, all these runs were operated in the
biphasic region. As expected, the samples taken from these three
runs exhibited the same morphology: dense films accompanied
by microparticles, similar to that shown in Figure 4a.
The morphology had a significant change when the precipita-
tions were implemented at 8.5 MPa and 308.2 K (runs 6, 20,
25, and 30), as illustrated in Figure 7, where those FESEM
images were taken at the same magnification. Figure 7a shows
that uniform nanoparticles were formed as the mole fractions
of DMSO in the mixed solvents were no greater than 0.5 (runs
6 and 20). By using the mixed solvent of higher DMSO contents
(DMSO/EtOH ) 7:3, run 25), submicron- and nanoparticles
were produced simultaneously, as presented in Figure 7b. Figure
7c reveals that both spherical submicro- and microparticles were
generated when pure DMSO was used as solvent (run 30). We
suggested that runs 6 and 20 were operated in the supercritical
region, while runs 25 and 30 were conducted in the superheated
vapor region or near supercritical region. Although the critical
pressures of the CO2 + DMSO + ethanol ternary system are
not sensitive to the molar ratio of DMSO to ethanol at 308.2 K
(Chiu et al.24) and their values are around 7.9 MPa, the MCP
of the quaternary system (in the presence of solute ceftazidime)
may be moved toward higher pressures and thus enlarged the
area of the superheated vapor region, especially in the cases of
higher molar ratios of DMSO in the mixed solvents because
the solubility of ceftazidime in DMSO is substantially greater
than that in ethanol. Similar results were also found from another
series of runs (12, 23, 28, and 33) at 10 MPa and 318.2 K.
Six different solvent media were used in runs 9, 22, 27, 32,
34, and 35, respectively. All these runs were conducted at 15
MPa and 308.2 K, at which the precipitating conditions are far
beyond the critical points of the corresponding systems of CO2
+ solvent (or mixed solvents)22–24,27,28 to ensure that the
precipitations were operated in the supercritical region. Figure
8 shows the morphologies of the particles produced from
different organic solvents. Spherical primary particles with
diameters smaller than 100 nm were obtained from all the runs.
As seen from panels a, b, and c of Figure 8, the size of the
nanoparticles appears to increase with an increase of DMSO
mole fraction in the mixed solvents, but smaller particles were
produced by using pure DMSO solvent, as illustrated in Figure
8d. Figure 8e shows that coalescing ultrafine particles were
generated by using pure NMP as solvent, and Figure 8f reveals
that separated nanoparticles with narrow PSD were obtained
from DMF solvent.
3.3. Physicochemical Characterization. The thermal prop-
erties of the ceftazidime samples were examined with DSC and
TGA. Figure 9 presents the DSC thermograms in the range of
320 to 420 K for unprocessed material and three representative
experiments prepared from different phase regions (run 10:
supercritical region; run 11: compressed liquid region; run 13:
superheated vapor region). The thermogram of the original
ceftazidime shows an endothermic melting peak around 393 K,
whereas no endothermic peak was detected for all SAS-
processed samples. The analysis results reveal that ceftazidime
after SAS processing is amorphous. Figure 10 presents the
patterns of TGA analyses from 303 to 1053 K for the received
ceftazidime and the SAS-processed sample. The results display
that water content was reduced after SAS micronization.
The X-ray diffraction analyses were also made to determine
the degree of crystallinity of the ceftazidime samples. Figure
