二、 英文摘要 
The masking properties of the human ear 
have been successfully applied to adapt a 
speech enhancement system, yielding an 
improvement in speech quality. The accuracy 
of estimated speech spectra plays a major role 
in computing the noise masking threshold. 
Although traditional methods using the 
power-spectral-subtraction method to roughly 
estimate the speech spectra can provide an 
acceptable performance, the estimated speech 
spectra can be further improved for computing 
the noise masking threshold. In this research 
project, we aim at finding a better spectral 
estimate of speech by the 
two-step-decision-directed method. In turn, 
this estimate is employed to compute the noise 
masking threshold of a perceptual gain factor. 
The denoised speech signal is therefore 
refined. Experimental results show that the 
amounts of residual noise can be efficiently 
suppressed by embedding the two-step- 
decision-directed algorithm in the perceptual 
gain factor. The speech quality can be also 
maintained at an acceptable level. 
Consequently, the enhanced speech is 
efficiently refined. 
Keywords: Speech enhancement; power 
spectral subtraction; masking property;

一、 前言 
Speech enhancement is useful in many 
applications such as voice communication and 
automatic speech recognition. Recently, many 
novel schemes (Amehraye et al., 2008; Cappe, 
1994; Ding et al., 2009; Ephraim and Malah, 
1984; Ghanbari and Karami-Mollaei, 2006;

proposed to enhance a speech signal which is 
corrupted by additive noise. Although their

The object of this study is to find an 
appropriate gain factor )ω,(mg
 
which can 
remove greater quantity of added noise, while 
speech quality can be maintained at an 
acceptable level.  
 
4.2. Proposed perceptual-decision-directed 
gain factor 
In order to improve the performance of a 
gain factor for noise reduction, a 
perceptual-decision-direct approach, which 
estimates a gain factor by three steps, is 
proposed here. Initially, the decision-directed 
method (Cappe, 1994; Ephraim and Malah, 
1984) is performed to enhance a corrupted 
speech signal. Although the decision-directed 
method is better able to reduce the effect of 
musical residual noise, it introduces a frame 
delay arose from the interpolation for 
estimating the a priori SNR. Therefore, a 
decision-directed method is performed again 
to improve the estimated a priori SNR by 
removing the frame delay (Plapous et al., 
2006). These procedures formulate a two-step 
decision directed (TSDD) algorithm. In turn, 
we apply this TSDD algorithm to estimate the 
spectra of pre-processed speech which will be 
employed to estimate the noise masking 
threshold (NMT). Hence, a perceptual gain 
factor which plays the role as the third step is 
adapted by the NMT. Finally, the spectra of 
enhanced speech are obtained by multiplying 
the spectra of noisy speech with this 
perceptual gain factor. 
 
4.2.1.Two-Step-Decision-Directed Algorithm 
 
The spectral estimate of a pre-processed 
speech signal )ω,(~ mS  can be obtained by 
multiplying a gain factor )ω,(mg  with the 
spectra of noisy speech as expressed in (2). 
The gain factor is decided by the estimated a

The a priori SNR is unknown, and is critical 
to the gain factor ),( ωmg DD  given in (4). It 
can be estimated by the decision-directed

1984), given as

When the a posteriori SNR ),(
 
ωγ mpost
 
is 
much larger than 0dB, i.e., a speech-dominant 
frame, the estimate of the a priori SNR 
),(ˆ ωγ mprio , given in (5), corresponds to a 
frame delayed version of the a priori SNR. 
When the a posteriori SNR is lower than or 
close to 0dB, the estimate of the a priori SNR 
),(ˆ ωγ mprio  corresponds to a highly smoothed 
and delayed version of the a posteriori SNR. 
Thus the variance of the a priori SNR is 
reduced compared to the a posteriori SNR. 
Consequently, the effect of musical residual 
noise is reduced.  
The delay inherent to the decision-directed 
algorithm is a drawback especially in speech 
transients, e.g., the onset and the offset of a 
vowel signal. In addition, this delay introduces 
bias in gain estimation as given in (4), and 
limits the performance of noise reduction for a 
speech enhancement system. Hence, the 
delayed version of gain factor will generate an 
annoying reverberation effect. In order to 
compensate for this delay phenomenon, 
Plapous et al. (2006) proposed using a 
two-step-decision-directed (TSDD) algorithm 
to improve the estimate of the a priori SNR.  
In the first step, the decision-directed 
algorithm (Cappe, 1994; Ephraim and Malah, 
1984) is used to estimate the a priori SNR. 
This algorithm computes the spectral gain 
),( ωmg DD  as described in (4)-(6). In the 
second step, the value of this gain factor 
),( ωmg DD  is used to estimate the a priori 
SNR for the frame m+1, given as

4.2.3.  Perceptual gain factor 
 
The spectral estimate of a speech signal 
)ω,(ˆ mS  is obtained by multiplying a 
perceptual gain factor )ω,(mgPDD  with the 
noisy spectrum )ω,(mY . This perceptual gain 
factor serves as the third step of the proposed 
approach.  
The spectral estimate of an enhanced speech 
signal can be expressed by

of a speech enhancement system, and is given 
by  
)ω ,()ω ,( )ω ,()ω ,(ˆ )ω,( mEmEmSmSmE RS +=−=  (21)

where )ω,(mS  and )ω,(mD  represent the 
spectra of speech and of noise signals, 
respectively. 
  We use the assumption that the noise 
signal is additive and is uncorrelated with a 
speech signal. The gain factor )ω,(mg  can 
be optimized by minimizing the short-term 
spectral energy associated with the speech 
distortion, subject to a constraint on the 
short-term spectral energy related to residual 
noise below the noise masking threshold

五、結果與討論 
5.1.Experimental results 
In the following experiments, speech 
signals are Mandarin Chinese spoken by five 
female and five male speakers. Noisy speech 
signals are obtained by adding a clean speech 
signal with white, F16-cockpit, factory, babble 
(speech-like), helicopter-cockpit, and car 
noise signals, which are extracted from the 
Noisex-92 database. Three SNR levels, 
including 0 dB, 5 dB and 10dB, are used to 
evaluate the performance of a speech 
 7
outperforms the other two methods, such as 
white, F16-cockpit, factory, helicopter-cockpit 
noise corruptions. In the case of babble noise 
corruption with low-SNR inputs (0dB and 5 
dB), the perceptual method outperforms the 
TSDD and the proposed methods. This is 
because the spectral properties of babble noise 
are similar to the speech signal, enabling the 
noise spectral magnitude to be inaccurately 
estimated. The more the noise is reduced, the 
greater is the speech distortion. Thus the 
TSDD algorithm suffers the most 
deterioration of speech, yielding the lowest 
values of SegSNR improvement. Because the 
proposed method also employs the NMT to 
adapt the perceptual gain factor, the 
performance of the proposed method can 
approximate that of the perceptual method.

5.1.3. Modified Bark spectral distortion 
The Bark spectral distortion (BSD) 
measure has been shown to be a good 
candidate for a highly correlated objective 
quality measure (Wang et al., 1992). Yang et 
al. (1998) proposed a modified BSD (MBSD) 
which is an improved version of the BSD to 
evaluate speech quality. The MBSD measure 
incorporates the concept of noise masking 
properties into the BSD measure, where any 
distortion below the noise masking threshold 
(NMT) is not included in the BSD measure. 
Consequently, the noise spectral components 
below the NMT are considered to be 
inaudible and these components are excluded 
from the calculation of the MBSD. The 
MBSD is expressed as (Yang et al., 1998)

comparisons in terms of the MBSD. The 
minimal MBSD corresponds to the best 
speech quality. From the performances

experimental result is consistent with the 
performance presented in terms of the MBSD 
shown in Table 2.  
In addition, the proposed approach 
outperforms the TSDD method in all 
experiments. Consequently, the proposed 
method can be regarded as an improved 
version of the TSDD method. The proposed 
gain factor is not only better able to remove 
greater amounts of residual noise than the 
perceptual method, but is also able to maintain 
better speech quality than the TSDD method.  
 
5.1.5. Waveforms 
Figure 1 shows an example of waveform 
plots for comparison. A speech signal uttered 
by a female speaker is corrupted by white 
noise with Avg_SegSNR = 0 dB. Observing 
Figs. 1(c-e), a clipped signal is absent at the 
output waveforms of the three methods. This 
is due to the speech enhancement systems 
employing the minimum statistics algorithm 
(Martin, 2001), which does not overestimate 
the noise level for each subband; enabling 
these methods not to over-attenuate the noisy 
speech signals.  
 
Fig. 1 Example of speech signal spoken in 
Mandarin by a female speaker. (from top to 
bottom) (a) clean speech, (b) noisy speech 
corrupted by white noise with average 
segmental SNR = 0 dB , (c) enhanced speech 
using two-step-decision-directed method, (d) 
enhanced speech using perceptual method, (e) 
enhanced speech using proposed method. 
 
Comparing the waveforms of enhanced 
speech shown in Figs. 1(c-d), the TSDD 
method is better able to remove greater 
amounts of residual noise than the perceptual 
method. Thus, integrating the 
decision-directed method into the perceptual 
gain factor can significantly improve the 
performance of the perceptual method by 
removing greater amounts of residual noise. 
This fact enables the enhanced speech of the 
proposed method to sound less annoying than 
that produced by the perceptual method. The 
major reason is that the speech spectra can be 
better estimated by the TSDD method than by 
the power-spectral-subtraction method. 
Although the proposed method significantly 
reduces the amounts of residual noise in 
speech-pause regions, the enhanced speech 
signal does not severely deteriorate during 
speech-dominant regions. Therefore, the 
speech quality can be maintained at an 
acceptable level.  
 
5.1.6. Spectrograms 
In order to yield more information about 
residual noise and speech distortion, we 
analyze the time-frequency distribution of 
enhanced speech and evaluate the structure of 
residual noise by observing speech 
spectrograms. Figures 2 and 3 present 
spectrogram comparisons for various speech 
enhancement methods. A speech signal is 
corrupted by factory (non-stationary) and 
white (stationary) noise signals with 
Avg_SegSNR = 0 dB. In Fig. 2, a speech 
signal is uttered by a female speaker, and 
corrupted by factory noise (Fig. 2(b)) with 
Avg_SegSNR = 0 dB. Observing the 
spectrograms of enhanced speech shown in 
Figs. 2(c-e), the harmonic spectra of vowel 
signals can be preserved in the enhanced 
speech signals. Thus all of these three 
methods do not suffer from over-attenuating 
noisy speech to remove larger amounts of 
residual noise. In addition, the spectrograms 
also reveal the fine structure of spectra in 
speech-activity regions. A muffled signal is 
absent at the output of each speech 
enhancement method. Comparing the 
spectrograms of enhanced speech during 
speech-pause regions, the proposed method 
shown in Fig. 2(e) is better able to remove 
background/residual noise than the perceptual 
method shown in Fig. 2(d). In Figs. 2(c) and 
2(e), the proposed method is better able to 
reserve weak harmonic spectra in high 
frequency subbands. So the speech quality 
produced by the proposed method is better 
maintained than the TSDD method. 
In the cases of white noise corruption (Fig. 
 11
the TSDD algorithm to estimate speech 
spectra which is utilized to compute the noise 
masking threshold (NMT) is beneficial in 
improving the performance of the perceptual 
method (Hu and Loizou, 2004) by reducing 
greater amounts of residual noise. 
 
5.1.7. Listening tests 
 A subjective measure reflects the way the 
signal is perceived by listeners, and such a 
measure expresses how pleasant the signal 
sounds. Here, a subjective test methodology 
which is standardized by the ITU-T P.835 
(ITU-T, 2003) is employed to evaluate the 
performance of a speech enhancement system. 
This methodology uses separate rating scales 
to independently estimate the subjective 
quality of the speech signal alone, the 
background noise alone, and the overall effect 
of speech and noise on quality. Thus the 
uncertainty of listeners is reduced as the 
reliability of the listening test increases.  
The ITU-T P.835 method instructs a 
listener to successively rate the enhanced 
speech signals for evaluation. For the signal 
distortion rating, subjects are instructed to 
rate the speech distortion on a five-category 
scale. The descriptions of the scales are as 
follows: score 1for very degraded, 2 for fairly 
degraded, 3 for somewhat degraded, 4 for 
slightly degraded, and 5 for not degraded.  
In the case of rating the background noise 
distortion, subjects are instructed to rate the 
background noise on the five-category 
intrusive scale. The scale is as follows: 1 for 
very intrusive, 2 for somewhat intrusive, 3 for 
noticeable but not intrusive, 4 for somewhat 
noticeable, and 5 for not noticeable. Finally, 
subjects are instructed to rate the overall 
quality which is represented in terms of a 
mean-opinion score (MOS). This score is also 
used to evaluate the global appreciation of the 
residual noise contamination and the speech 
distortion. The scale is as follows: 1 bad, 2 
poor, 3 fair, 4 good, and 5 excellent.  
The subjective listening tests were 
conducted on eleven listeners. Each listener 
gave each test signal a score between one and 
five for signal distortion, background noise 
distortion and overall quality for a test speech 
signal. Table 4 presents the results of 
performance comparisons. Initially, the clean 
and the noisy speech signals which had been 
corrupted by helicopter-cockpit noise were 
played back for the listening test. Then, the 
utterances of enhanced speech produced by 
the TSDD, the perceptual, and the proposed 
methods were played to listeners in random 
order. The listener were requested to score the 
noisy speech and enhanced speech signals 
during a silent period.  
In the case of speech distortion shown in 
Table 4, the proposed and the perceptual 
methods outperform the TSDD method under 
all conditions. It is attributed to the fact that 
the TSDD method over-attenuates noisy 
speech, resulting in more speech distortion 
than the other two methods. Thus both the 
perceptual and the proposed methods can 
maintain higher speech quality. Observing the 
performance in terms of background noise 
distortion, the proposed method outperforms 
the other two methods. Although the TSDD 
method is better able to remove greater 
amounts of background noise, it causes a 
musical effect of residual noise which is 
perceptually more annoying than background 
noise. Consequently, the scores in terms of 
background noise distortion are reduced. On 
the other hand, the perceptual method is less 
able to reduce background noise, so the 
background noise is retained much more than 
in the other two methods. The background 
noise is still apparent in the enhanced speech, 
yielding the performance in terms of 
background noise distortion to be the worst 
among the three speech enhancement 
methods. As the performances in speech 
distortion are not significantly different 
among the three speech enhancement 
methods, so the speech distortion only has a 
slight impact on the score of overall speech 
quality. The major difference among them is 
on the annoyance levels of residual noise and 
of background noise. Observing the 
performance comparisons in terms of overall 
quality shown in Table 4, the proposed 
approach outperforms the other two methods 
in all conditions. The major reason is 
attributed to the fact that the proposed method 
is better able to reduce the amount and the 
magnitude of residual noise. Comparing the 
TSDD and the proposed methods, the 
proposed method employs the NMT to adapt 
the perceptual-decision-directed gain factor 
given in (25). This makes the distribution of 
the spectral peaks of residual noise tend to be 
less isolated than that of the TSDD method. 
 13
TSDD algorithm serves as the first two steps. 
This is also the reason why the proposed 
method is better able to reduce greater 
amounts of residual noise than the perceptual 
algorithm as shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. 
Moreover, the enhanced speech produced by 
the proposed method does not suffer from the 
echo effect. This is due to the fact that the 
TSDD algorithm does not incur tracing delay 
during the offset of a vowel or a strong-energy 
spectrum. Thus the propagation of strong 
energy is absent at the output of the TSDD 
algorithm as given in (12). Applying this 
speech spectral estimate to find the NMT does 
not introduce energy propagation. Therefore, 
the enhanced speech produced by the 
proposed method given in (25) is free from the 
annoying reverberation effect. 
Although the TSDD method is better able 
to suppress residual noise, a gain factor is only 
determined according to the estimated a priori 
SNR. A trade-off between the amounts of 
residual noise and speech distortion is not 
considered, so the ability to prevent speech 
distortion decreases. In this study, we propose 
not only employing the improved version of 
the estimated a priori SNR, but also utilizing 
the NMT to adapt a gain factor for speech 
enhancement. The proposed approach can 
reduce a greater amount of residual noise in 
noise-dominant regions and in this way an 
improved result can be achieved. We thank the 
contribution of the TSDD algorithm which is 
embedded in the proposed speech 
enhancement system. In addition, the 
proposed method also can preserve the spectra 
of speech with weak energy. This is due to the 
contribution of the perceptual gain factor 
given in (25), enabling speech distortion to be 
kept to a low level in enhanced speech. 
Consequently, the proposed approach is an 
improved version of the perceptual gain 
factor. 
 
5.3.結論 
The spectral estimates of a speech signal 
play a major role in deciding the value of the 
noise masking threshold which is used to 
adapt the perceptual gain factor. In this 
research project, we employ the two-step- 
decision-directed (TSDD) algorithm to 
improve the accuracy of estimated speech 
spectra. In turn, these spectra of pre-processed 
speech are employed to compute the NMT 
which is applied to adapt a perceptual gain 
factor. This leads to a significant improvement 
of the perceptual gain factor in reducing 
greater amounts of residual noise. The 
enhanced speech signal is accordingly refined. 
In addition, the proposed approach also can 
improve the performance of the TSDD 
algorithm. This is due to the fact that the 
TSDD does not consider the auditory 
properties of the human ear in adapting the 
speech enhancement system. A trade-off 
between the amounts of residual noise 
containment and speech distortion is not 
considered. Although the amounts of residual 
noise of the TSDD algorithm are comparable 
to the proposed approach, the enhanced 
speech produced by the TSDD algorithm 
sounds more annoying than that of the 
proposed method. This is because of the 
apparently isolated spectral peaks of residual 
noise. Experimental results show that the 
proposed approach cannot only significantly 
improve the performance of the perceptual 
method in removing greater amounts of 
residual noise, but also can ensure enhanced 
speech quality at an acceptable level. 
Consequently, the proposed approach can be 
regarded as an improved version of the 
perceptual and of the TSDD methods.

國科會補助專題研究計畫項下出席國際學術會議心得報告 
                                     日期：99 年 8月 16 日 
一、參加會議經過 
本次會議屬於IEEE Computer Society的國際研討會議，承辦單位為IACSIT(International Association 
of Computer Science and Information Technology)，會議的地點是在印尼峇里島舉行，會議場所選在當地
非常大的 Bali Dynasty Resort 飯店舉辦。為了增加會議主題的廣泛程度，IACSIT 在同一時間、同一
地點舉辦四項主題的研討會議，分別為： 
International Conference on Computer Engineering and Applications (ICCEA 2010) 
International Conference on Telecom Technology and Applications (ICTTA), 2010 
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery (ICKD), 2010 
IACSIT International Workshop on Information and Emerging Technologies (IACSIT IWIET), 2010  
    凡是參與其中一項研討會的與會學者，可以前往任意一個會場聆聽自己感到有興趣的場次與作者
及其研究團隊作討論。在ICTTA研討會議中，除了發表論文的作者之外，也有許多業界人士前往參加
會議，和報告論文的作者討論最新的研究成果及其相關技術。會議的主辦單位將已接受的論文分成12
個場次 (sessions)，並且以口頭報告的方式呈現大家的研究成果。 
 本次大會將每天的會議分成2~3個時段，每個時段有3個sessions 同時舉行，每個 session 的時段為
120分鐘，每篇論文有20分鐘的報告時間，與會人士可以根據自己的研究興趣前往各個論文報告會場聆
聽作者的論文報告，並與作者做充分的討論與意見交流。 
  為了讓與會學者有機會了解更多的資訊與工程研究領域，IACSIT安排了三位IEEE Fellows介紹三項
瞻性的研究主題(Prof. Wang Jun, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prof. Derong Liu, Department of

參加2010 ICCTTA 研討會議並發表論文之後，蒐集到很多建議，也增加很多新的觀念與想法，覺得我
們獲益良多，對於未來的研究方向，也增加了一些觸角。 
    由於ICTTA的論文主題很多，包括語音處理、影像處理、視訊處理、網路通訊、射頻通訊、模糊
理論應用、控制應用、行動通訊、多重輸入多重輸出應用、生醫信號處理、陣列信號處理、語音與影
像結合之辨識系統等等，討論的領域很廣泛，參加研討會可以增廣自己的研究領域，學習各種信號處
理、通訊、控制的相關研究方法與技術，對於拓展研究領域範圍，融合不同領域的關鍵技術到自己目
前的研究主題，助益很多；而且可以讓自己在目前的研究主題上，產生許多新的創意。 
    
三、考察參觀活動(無是項活動者略) 
無 
 
四、建議 
    由於 ICTTA與 Computer Engineering and Applications(ICCEA)、Knowledge Discovery (ICKD)、
Information and Emerging Technologies同時舉辦，而且與 Computer Engineering and Applications 
(ICCEA)、Information and Emerging Technologies(IACSIT IWIET)的質性有極多相似之處，有許多音
訊處理與影像處理的相關論文也在 ICCEA與 ICIET會議中發表；因此，不同會議同時、同地舉行，
除了對於研究主題沒有確定的新進研究人員而言，可以藉由參加 ICTTA 研討會的方式，聽取各種
研究領域的研究成果，並且親身向該領域的研究專家面對面請益；除了吸取他們的研究經驗之外，
也可以因討論而產生更多想法，讓自己找到適當的研究方向與目標；而對於已經有研究主題的研
究人員來說，也可以增加許多創意的點子，所以參加多種性質聯合舉辦的研討會，對於提升自己
的研究能力，也是非常有幫助。
