2. EXPERIMENTAL 
The Zn target with negligible impurities (99.9% pure) 
was subject to energetic Nd-YAG-laser (Lotis, 1064 nm 
in wavelength, beam mode: TEM00) pulse irradiation in 
air or in a chamber vacuumed down to 4 x10-3 Pa, with a 
specified oxygen flow rate from 0 to 30 mL/min.  Laser 
beam was focused to a spot size of 0.03 mm2 on the 
target under laser pulse energy of 560 mJ/pulse, i.e. 
power density of 1.17×1012 watts/cm2 given pulse time 
duration of 16 ns at 10 Hz under Q-switch mode.  
Soda-lime glass or copper grids overlaid with a 
carbon-coated collodion film without a preheating 
treatment were fixed in position by a holder at a distance 
of 2.5 to 10 mm from the target to collect the Zn/ZnO 
condensates.  Additional experiment under free run 
mode at much higher pulse energy of 1040 mJ/pulse and 
a 3 orders-of-magnitude higher oxygen flow rate of 50 
L/min in air was conducted for a comparison of preferred 
orientation and shape of the condensates. 
 
 The oxygen flow rate dependence of the size, 
orientation and lattice parameters of the Zn and ZnO 
phases in the samples deposited on glass was determined 
by X-ray diffraction (XRD, CuKα, D5000 instrument).  
High resolution XRD (CuKα, D1 instrument) step-scan 
with 0.001 degree increment was also employed to 
resolve the nearly superimposed {10 1 1}W-ZnO and 
(0002)Zn peaks.  Optical microscopy under plane 
polarized light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, 
JEOL6330, 10 kV) were used to study the size 
distribution and microstructures, in particular the extent 
of coalescence of the condensates that accounts for the 
preferred orientation of the deposits on glass.  The 
composition and crystal structures of the individual 
condensates on the carbon-coated collodion film were 
characterized by field emission transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 at 200 kV) 
coupled with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), 
and point-count energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis 
at a beam size of 5 nm.  The EDX analysis was 
performed using K shell counts for Zn and O, and the 
principle of ratio method without absorption correction.8
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The XRD whole trace showed a strong preferred 
orientation of (0001)Zn and (10 1 1)W-ZnO for all the 
condensates deposited on soda-lime glass at 560 mJ/pulse 
and 0 to 30 ml/min oxygen flow rate in vacuum9 (Fig. 1).  
The corresponding high resolution XRD step-scan 
showed well resolved (1011)W-ZnO and (0002)Zn peaks 
with varied relative intensity and d-spacing as a function 
of oxygen flow rate (Fig. 1).  Our additional experiment 
of laser ablation condensation at a relatively high pulse 
energy of 1040 mJ/pulse and a high oxygen flow rate of 
50L/min in air showed also the preferred orientations 
(0001)Zn and (10 1 1)W-ZnO for the deposit on glass 
substrate.9  The preferred orientations of the W-ZnO and 
Zn deposits were independently developed because 
(0001)Zn is not parallel to (1011)W-ZnO given the epitaxial 
relationships of the condensates determined by TEM. 
Optical polarized microscopic observations of the 
deposit overlaid on glass in vacuum showed opaque Zn, 
birefringent W-ZnO, and craters ca 40 μm in diameter 
presumably due to impact of Zn-rich plumes.9 The tiny 
W-ZnO condensates were significantly assembled at 20 
mL/min of oxygen and coalesced up to tens of 
micrometers in size at 30 mL/min of oxygen.  The 
coalesced W-ZnO condensates showed interference color 
rather than isotropic extinction under crossed polarizers.  
This is in accord with the preferred orientation (1011) 
rather than (0001), the latter would otherwise be extinct 
under crossed polarizers.  The faceted domains with 
different interference color across planar boundaries (not 
shown) can be attributed to {1011}-specific coalescence 
twinning as manifested by TEM observations of the 
condensates collected on carbon-coated collodion film. 
Based on the interference color change under an 
accessory 　 retardation plate, the coalesced/elongated 
W-ZnO condensates were found to have a lower 
refractive index for the long axis than the short axis.  
This indicates that the W-ZnO condensates do not 
coalesce/extend along the crystallographic c-axis, i.e. the 
crystal direction with the greatest refractive index 
(ne=2.005).10
SEM secondary electron images of the sample 
deposited on glass in vacuum showed more clearly the 
shape of the plume-induced craters and the size 
distribution of the condensates9 (Fig. 2a).  The image 
magnified from the relatively flat area showed individual 
W-ZnO condensates less than 0.3 μm in size, which have 
well-developed facets and were more or less coalesced.  
The W-ZnO condensates were finer in size (0.1 μm to 
0.05 μm) yet significantly sintered when deposited under 
a higher oxygen flow rate of 20 mL/min (Fig. 2b) and 30
