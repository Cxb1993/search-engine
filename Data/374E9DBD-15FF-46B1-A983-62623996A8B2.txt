Lin and Chang [4] present a relation-based 
watermarking technique for image 
authentication to extract a digital signature by 
using the invariant relation existing between 
any two DCT coefficients which were located 
at the same position of two different 8x8 
blocks for making the image authentication 
system to be tolerable to JPEG compression. 
They dedicated themselves to exploring the 
operation in a JPEG-based system. Wang and 
Permain [7] proposed two watermarking 
methods to detect and locate the tampered area 
in 2004. These two methods estimate the 
changing of luminance information in spatial 
domain, and the changing of AC coefficients 
in DCT frequency domain for hiding 
watermarking bits. Wang use the relationship 
between any two blocks as a basis to embed 
information. By estimating the DC coefficient 
in a center block of nine 8x8 blocks, they 
replace the center DC coefficient by the 
averaging of DC coefficients around the center 
8x8 block. This method makes the 
watermarked image a bad effect of human 
vision because they replaced the DC 
coefficient, especially on the edge or the 
highly variation areas. 
In this paper, we focus on authenticating 
and recovering compressed image data. Block-
related feature codes are designed for 
authenticating. Mapping table is used for 
embedding authenticating information. And by 
using block-classification, applying different 
coefficient scan pattern makes a good 
coefficient preserving efficiency. As the 
experimental results, we can detect and locate 
the malicious tampered areas and the 
watermarked image can hold a high PSNR 
value with more than 40.00dB. 
 
2. THE PROPOSED AUTHENTICATING 
METHOD 
 
In this section, we will make an introduction to 
the proposed authenticating method. YCbCr is 
one of the common used color spaces. It was 
applied on JPEG, JPEG2000, MPEG series 
and H.26x series compressed image/video data. 
The proposed authenticating method is based 
on two types of information hiding methods – 
digital watermarking and digital signature. 
Digital watermarking conceals the 
authenticating information from un-authorized 
users. And digital signature is used to store the 
block recovering information. 
 
2.1. The generation of authentication bits 
 
As the JPEG image compression standard, a 
color space, YCbCr, is used for representing 
the information of an image. In the generating 
steps, we first convert the RGB information to 
YCbCr color space. After that, a fast discrete 
cosine transform is than performed. The 
discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a Fourier-
related transform similar to the discrete 
Fourier transform (DFT), but using only real 
numbers. For example, a DCT is used in JPEG 
image compression, MJPEG, MPEG, H.26x 
and DV video compression. 
According to Ching-Yung Lin and Shih-Fu 
Chang’s theorems [4], any two different 8x8 
blocks would hold the following 
characteristics:

Where ( )vuF qp ,,Δ  means the distance 
between block p and q in the same position of 
DCT coefficients which are non-quantized 
coefficients, and ( )vuF qp ,~ ,Δ  denotes the 
quantized one. It implies that block 
relationship will always keep the same status 
whether the coefficients have been quantized 
or not. 
In the proposed method, we expand these 
properties above to a macro block. A macro 
block is defined as a set of m 8x8 blocks. The 
minimum one is 3x3 and then we chose nine 
DC coefficients for a basis of DC features. The 
macro block is shown as a sample as the 
following:

‘1’ is going to be concealed, then we fix the 
coefficient to 3xQLB(k) which is mapped to ‘1’ 
and is the nearest one. Otherwise if bit ‘0’ is 
going to be concealed, we fix the current 
coefficient to 2xQLB(k). 
 
2.3. The authenticating method 
 
In the authenticating procedure, we first 
extract the DC and AC feature codes from an 
unauthenticated image by the following 
formula. The embedding procedure may cause 
the count of non-zero AC coefficients to be 
more or less. We use a threshold t for a 
tolerance. In our experiments, t = 1 is the 
better option. Then, we extract the embedded 
authentication bits and calculate the difference 
between these two feature-code sets. 
For example, in the horizontal relationship, 
the feature code extraction would be modified 
to

Then we compare the extracted feature 
codes and the embedded authentication bits. if 
they are not match to each other, we can call 
the current block is malicious tampered. The 
proposed authenticating flow-chart is shown as 
figure 4. 
 
3. THE PROPOSED RECOVERING 
METHOD 
 
In fact, the image authentication has been 
studied for a very long time and a lot of papers 
were proposed in the field of digital image 
watermarking. The new direction that has been 
more popular is image recovering technology. 
Image recovering here means the information 
restoration which could find out and recover 
the lost information or damages.

noise that affects the fidelity of its 
representation. Because many signals have a 
very wide dynamic range, PSNR is usually 
expressed in terms of the logarithmic decibel 
scale. 
The PSNR is most commonly used as a 
measure of quality of reconstruction in image 
compression etc. It is most easily defined via 
the mean squared error (MSE) which for two 
m×n monochrome images f and f’ where one 
of the images is considered a noisy 
approximation of the other is defined as: 
 
 ( ) ( )[ ]
NM
jifjif
MSE ×
′−= ∑ 2,,  (11) 
 
 
MSE
PSNR 255log10 10=  (12) 
 
Typical values for the PSNR in image 
quality are between 30 and 40 dB. The PSNR 
which lower than 20dB usually cannot be 
accepted by human vision. A miss-error detect 
rate is also used to measure the proposed 
method. Typically it can descript two type of 
definitions – miss-detect and error-detect. 
Miss-detect denote as, when a block is 
malicious tampered and the authenticating 
process cannot discern it. And error-detect 
denote as, when a block has not been tampered 
but the authenticator cannot identify and mark 
as tampered. Both these two situations 
shouldn’t appeared in the image authentication 
procedure. 
In our experiment process, we have tested 
twelve images which have different contents. 
These samples can be categorized to high 
detailed, high flatted, darkness and brightness. 
These images denote as 1 to 12. Besides that, 
we also compared to the other three proposed 
papers [6], [7] and [4]. The PSNR of 
watermarked images are shown as figure 8 and 
the error-detection statistic chart is shown as 
figure 9. Figure 10. (a) to (d) are the 
experimental images. (a) is the watermarked 
image with size 320x240 and the PSNR is 
40.52dB. (b) is the malicious tampered image 
and (c) is the authenticating result. The marked 
area with red boundary is called the tampered 
area. The recovered image is shown as figure 
10. (d).
