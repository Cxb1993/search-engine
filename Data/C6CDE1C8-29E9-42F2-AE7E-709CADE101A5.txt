Abstract 
Pt/LaF3/Pt assembly for sensing O2 and 
CO at room temperature has been developed.  
For sensing oxygen, sensitivity decreased from 
49.2 to 28.7 mV/decade when gas flow rate 
increased from 50 to 80 ml/min.  Sensing 
potential difference of carbon monoxide 
decreased significantly when O2 concentration 
was up to 40 %.  The sensing potential 
difference of mixed potential subtracting 
equilibrium potential of oxygen in Tafel plot 
for CO in the presence of O2 could correspond 
to that measured by open circuit potential.  In 
addition, the proposed Tafel plot was 
reasonable to explain the sensing potential 
difference of O2 and CO in oxygen. 
Keywords: electrochemical sensor, carbon 
monoxide, sputtering.  
 
1.  Introduction 
The incomplete combustion of fuel causes 
not only a lack of oxygen (O2) but also gas 
poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO).  In 
addition, CO is a typical component in 
exhausted gases from vehicles.  Therefore, the 
development for detecting O2 and CO becomes 
very important.  Electrochemical gas sensors 
utilized liquid electrolyte for detection of O2 or 
CO at room temperature, but they had several 
disadvantages associated with corrosion and 
packing.  The solid-state gas sensors generally 
used stabilized zirconia or semiconductors 
should be operated at high temperatures (above 
400 ºC).  However, sensors operated at high 
temperature have the major weakness about lot 
energy loss.  Some solid electrolytes operated 
at low temperature, consist mostly of metal 
halide, including β -PbF2[1], PbSnF4[2],and 
LaF3 [3-6].  LaF3 solid electrolyte has been 
found to be applicable at room temperature due 
to high conductivity [7].  Many previous 
researches revealed that LaF3 could be used to 
detect fluoride ion [3], gas O2 and dissolved O2 
in water at room temperature [4-6].  However, 
few studies on CO sensor operated at lower 
temperature with LaF3 solid electrolyte were 
revealed.  Kuwata et al. [8] reported that a 
solid electrolyte cell with LaF3 electrolyte was 
able to detect 1.3 % H2 or 1000 ppm CO in air 
at 100 ºC, but the sensing response was 
independent of the partial pressure of CO at 50 
ºC.  Therefore, it is our objective to develop 
the O2 and CO sensor with solid electrolyte 
operated at room temperature. 
From the previous studies in potentiometric 
sensors [4], the proof of the proposed sensing 
mechanism was mostly explained by the results 
corresponding to the number of electron 
transfer.  There were few researches to explain 
the sensing potential difference relative to 
concentration change by shift of equilibrium 
potential.  In this paper, besides developing 
the O2 and CO sensor with LaF3 solid 
electrolyte operated at room temperature, the 
Tafel plot was proposed to describe the 
relationship for the sensing potential 
differences changed with various 
concentrations of sensing gases. 
 
2.  Experimental 
more negative potential with increasing CO 
concentration.  Fig. 7 showed the linear 
dependence between sensing potential 
difference and logarithm of CO concentration 
at 30 % O2.  Fig. 8 showed that when CO 
coexisted with different concentrations of O2, 
the sensitivities decreased with increasing O2 
concentration.  The sensitivities for CO could 
not be influenced in lower O2 concentrations 
(less than 20 %), in the range of 63.7 to 74.6 
mV/decade.  But it decreased significantly 
down to 25.9 mV/decade when O2 
concentration was up to 40 %.  This result 
revealed that the present sensing device was 
suitable for the use in the environment with a 
small amount of O2. 
 
Proposed sensing mechanism 
When O2 coexisted with CO or unsaturated 
hydrocarbons at high temperature [10-12], a 
non-Nernstian potential developed at the 
electrode.  This non-equilibrium potential is 
established by the competing reactions of O2 
reduction and CO or hydrocarbon oxidation.  
Therefore, this mixed potential was dependent 
on kinetic factors and expected to be a strong 
function of gas concentration, of electrode 
material, and morphology.  The sensing 
mechanism of the present device seemed to be 
explained by the mixed potential.  From the 
previous work [9], the superoxide ion produced 
from Eq. (1) was very reactive, particularly in 
the presence of water, and was therefore 
expected to have a short lifetime.  There were 
supposed to have the second step of superoxide 
(HO2)becoming peroxide ion (O－).  It could 
be stabilized at the Pt/LaF3 interface because 
the peroxide ion was ion-exchanged with the 
lattice fluoride ion of LaF3.  The following 
reactions were suggested that could proceed at 
the Pt/LaF3 interface at the same time. 
−− =+ OeO 222      (2) 
−− +=+ eCOOCO 2     (3) 
The mixed potential occurred when the both 
reactions proceeded at an equal rate.  The 
electric current for Eq. (2) and (3) could be 
simplified from Butler-Volmer equation to the 
following general expressions when the 
overpotential was larger than 118/n mV for 
each reaction.

If O2 concentration was kept constant, Eq. (8)

There was a linear relationship between 
logarithm of CO concentration and mixed 
potential.  In addition, increasing the CO 
concentration caused the sensing potential to 
shift downward negative potential.  It was 
corresponding when the result in Fig. 6 
compared with Eq. (11).   
 
Experimental estimation of mixed potential 
From the chronoamperometry, the Tafel 
plot for 200 ppm CO and 30 % O2 could be 
obtained as shown in Fig. 9.  The potential EM 
presented the mixed potential which located on 
the intersection of Tafel plot for 200 ppm CO 
and 30 % O2.  The potential difference 
between EM and EO2 (equilibrium potential for 
30 % O2) was 66 mV (vs. Pt) that corresponded 
to that measured for 200 ppm CO by open 
circuit potential as in Fig. 6.

一、 參加會議經過 
 
本屆國際先進科技材料研討會 (International Conference on 
Materials for Advanced Technologies 2007)由新加坡國立大學(NUS)、
南洋科技大學(NTU)、材料研究所(IMRE)與其他國際機構，每兩年
在新加坡合辦一次的國際研討會，本屆為第四屆。在七月一日至六
日會期間，由 1600 參加人員在 26 會場發表 2500 篇論文，是東亞地
區規模最大的研討會之一。本人將國科會補助的燃料電池專題研究
成果口頭發表在 Nanostructured and Bulk Materials for Electrochemical 
Power Sources 會場，題目為 The Effect of Carbon Support on the Cell 
Performance of DMFC，並主持其中一場報告。 
 
此次出席會議的經費由國科會專題計畫「氟化鑭電解質在室溫
一氧化碳感測器之研發」(計劃編號：NSC 95-2221-E-006-410)補
助。由於補助費不高，無法支應歐美國家較適當的國際會議，只好
選擇東亞地區為目標。經上屆與會的台科大黃炳照教授、東海大學
杜景順教授介紹，本人第一次出席本屆會議。台灣有不少學者專家
參與本屆會議，如中正大學胡啟章教授、本校化學系的林宏萍教
授、本系的許梅娟、陳雲，但如往常並未集體出席，各大學教授也
都帶領學生參加，則是最近的趨勢。 
 
二、與會心得 
 
大會會議包括材料的所有領域，安排的九位大會演講中有三位
諾貝爾獎得主：1. Claude Cohen-Tannoudji 演講 Manipulating Atoms 
with Light，2. Barry Sharpless 演講 Orthogonal Reactivity，3. Robert 
Horvitz 演講 Cell Suicide: Programmed Cell Death in Development and 
Disease。九位大會演講有半數屬生化與醫藥領域，突顯出大隊此方
面的重視，應該與新加坡想要推動生化科技的理念有關。 
 
也建議學校在學生出國補助的程序上，可以更有彈性，以免無法達
到鼓勵學生出席國際會議的旨意。但必須預先注意到學生的實質參
與的程度，否則學生只是張貼一下海報後，就不見蹤影，不只給外
人不踏實的觀感，也養成學生假公濟私的習慣。
