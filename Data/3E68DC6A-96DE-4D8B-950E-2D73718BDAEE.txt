中文摘要：
薄膜蒸鍍技術在近年來由於半導體、光學、磁性、超導材料甚至氣體感測器之快速發展，受到
了極大的重視也成為一個重要的技術平台，廣泛應用到相當多領域。現今之氣體感測器由於其選擇
性、穩定性、複製性等特性仍有甚大的改進空間。目前已知摻雜貴重金屬可降低操作溫度，有時可
增加感測度，同時縮短反應及回復時間。薄膜電子特性亦受晶態、晶粒大小、晶體缺陷、比表面積、
表面奈米線等之影響。本計畫用真空蒸鍍(vacuum deposition method)之方式在石英基板上蒸鍍鎵薄
膜，之後再配合熱氧化法(thermal oxidation method)，並以混合掺雜與內部摻雜貴重金屬(Pt)或Ti來
製備氣體感測器。本計畫之製程中氧化過程首先在氮氣氣氛下升溫至所需溫度後，通入空氣再進行
氧化。初步結果顯示隨著製程條件之改變，所產生的鎵薄膜型態亦不同，且改變不同溫度可使感測
度增加，本計畫將系統化的深入探討薄膜型態與感測性質隨製程條件的變化。本研究結果，可開發
奈米線結構之製備技術，及其在氣體感測性提昇上之應用。

英文摘要：
Recently, The technique of vapor deposition are widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor,
optics, magnetism, superconductor, and even the gas sensors. The technique has been received lots of
attentions, and becomes an important technique platform widely used in various fields. The doping of a
semiconductor gas sensor with noble metal not only lowers its operation temperature but also may have
higher sensitivity and shorter response recovery time. The study is aimed at promoting the properties and
applications of gas sensors through a systematic study of the effect of nanowires and doping of noble metal
etc. In the proposal, the gas sensors prepared by the vacuum deposition method followed with thermal
oxidation method. A thin film of semiconductive oxides of gallium which may be doped with noble metal or
Ti will be deposited on quartz substrates. The oxidation process is proposed to be carried out as following
proposal, first, the Ga film is heated up in a furnace preset to the temperature at nitrogen atmosphere, then
oxidation at air atmosphere. Asystematic study is proposed to investigate the variation of morphology and the
sensing properties with process condition. The result of the research will help us to develop the nanowire
growth technique and to promote its application in the manufacture of gas sensors.

五、結果與討論
5-1摻雜對薄膜型態之影響(SEM 圖)
5-1-1 混合摻雜
此部分實驗為蒸鍍鎵厚度達1μm之後先摻雜不同濃度之Ti，接著在氮氣氣氛下升溫，達900℃
後氧化9小時。由圖3-2可看出，在此類型之摻雜製程下，Ti的摻雜會使氧化後的薄膜出現大量的
奈米帶，且隨著摻雜量的增加，奈米帶數量有增加的趨勢。

55-2-1 混合摻雜Ti對晶相之影響
圖5-4(a)~(d)分別為未摻雜、混合摻雜0.25%、1%及2%Ti之XRD分析圖。圖中顯示Ti層會
抑制氧化鎵結晶之形成，隨著Ti含量增加，結晶度下降，此結果與圖3-2所示符合，此外氧化鎵薄
膜仍然非常穩定，沒有其他晶相生成。原因可能為產生TiO2之訊號太弱以致XRD無法偵測出來。
5-2-2 內部摻雜Pt 熱處理對晶相之影響
圖5-5為PtO2之晶面示意圖[14]。圖3-10 為內部摻雜2%Pt在不同溫度及時間之薄膜熱處理後，
接著在900℃下氧化9小時之XRD分析圖。由圖可看出內部摻雜2%Pt氧化後，雖然熱擴散之時間
與溫度不同，但完成氧化程序後皆在40度左右出現一個新的波峰，由文獻可知Pt在加熱過程中會
形成氧化物[15]，根據圖3-10 PtO2之XRD 圖，可推測此波峰為PtO2的特徵波峰。由於Pt4+比Ga3+多
一個電子，當Pt4+取代Ga3+的位置時，Pt4+將會比原本的Ga3+多釋放出一個電子，整體而言，Pt4+的
產生可使材料得到更多電子，進而使感測性質發生轉變。

5-3摻雜對感測性質之影響
半導體氣體感測材料在偵測氣體時，其電阻會產生變化。此情況主要導因於被偵測之還原性氣體與
吸附在半導體氧化物上的氧離子產生反應。在本實驗中將電阻變化的現象做為半導體氣體感測器的
量測參數。

5-4溼度對感測穩定性之影響
由文獻[16] [17]所知，若感測氣氛中含有水氣對感測性質影響甚鉅，為了解水氣的存在是否使感測性質
產生變化，因此將探討溼度對感測穩定性之影響。由圖5-8得知濕度越高其感測度越差。

5-5操作溫度對感測度之影響
由圖5-9及5-10得知，氣體感測器的靈敏度有一最佳感測溫度，且摻雜貴金屬，會使得其最佳溫度
改變，需注意之。

六、成果自評
本研究進行了熱氧化法製備奈米線(片)結構之氧化鎵薄膜及其感測性質之研究，成功的藉著控
制氧化條件並以表面、混合掺雜，與內部掺雜等三種方式掺雜Ti及Pt，製備了各種型態的Ga2O3薄
膜及其感測性質之量測。達成了計劃目標，同時藉著研究過程亦發現了新的現象，值得進一步探討。
經此研究後，對於如何開發新製程及改善感測性上有較充份的了解，對未來發展實用技術相當有幫
助。

6I. INTRODUCTION
Recently, various types of gas sensors have been developed and
widely applied in various applications such as hazard gas detection,
air pollution control, process control, and so forth. Among them,
metal oxides semiconductor gas sensors are common used type. They
have several potential advantages over other types of gas sensors:
low cost; simple construction; resistance to environment, heat,
and corrosion; easy integration with microprocessor; and portable,
etc. In order to be a good sensor, the detecting material must
possess the following characteristics: 1. high sensitivity and
selectivity to specific gas; 2. a short response and recovery time;
3. good reproducibility and a long-term stability; and 4. simple
and easy measurement of signal2.
Comparing to other semiconductor materials, Ga2O3 has a better
performance in the environment of high irradiation and high
temperature. In addition, due to the high concentration of oxygen
vacancy in the Ga2O3, and the high specific surface, it is quite
suitable to be used as a gas sensor. 3
Ga2O3 gas sensor is characterized as a promising high temperature
sensor for the detection of reducing gases or oxygen.4 It has only
one stable oxidation state trivalent oxide of gallium, Ga2O3, and
one stable crystal modification, β-Ga2O3 (monoclinic).5 Various
polymorphs of Ga2O3 can be produced from different manufacturing
process. However, among them onlyβ-Ga2O3 is the stable oxidation
state in the range from room temperature up to its melting point
of about 1800 oC any other polymorphs of Ga2O3 will transform
intoβ-Ga2O3 on heating to a temperature over 870 oC.6 β-Ga2O3 has a
long-term stability, faster response and recovery times, and lower
cross-sensitivity to humidity, and its conduction mechanism is
characterized by an electron mobility independent of grain
boundaries.7
In the study, the rheotaxial growth and thermal oxidation (RGTO)
method was used to prepare Ga2O3 thin film on fused silica substrate.
Based on the method, liquid droplets of Ga were vacuum-deposited
on a substrate and then thermally oxidized to produce oxides. The
morphology and the electrical properties of the Ga2O3 films were
measured as functions of deposition rate, oxidation time, oxidation
8operated at a heating rate of 600 ℃/h and cooled by natural cooling.
The morphology is examined by SEM (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan, Model
S-4100).
The electrical properties are examined by measuring the
resistance change on switching back and forth between the
ethanol-air mixture and the dry air. For the measurement of
sensitivity for ethanol, the sample gas stream is prepared by
dividing a dry air stream of 1 Lpm into two streams. One of the
streams flows through a flask containing ethanol kept in a
thermostat at ice temperature and then mixes with another stream
to make up an ethanol–air stream with a concentration adjustable
by varying the stream ratio. The gas mixture flows through a bypass
before and after each measurement, and during the measurement it
is switched to flow through the quartz tube inside which the oxide
film locates and is kept at a preset temperature.
Figure 2 shows the setup in the measurement of sensitivity in
response to ethanol vapor. The chamber consists of a heating copper
rod on top of which is attached a sensor for the measurement of
gas sensitivity.
Fig.2 The setup in the measurement of sensitivity in response
to ethanol-air mixture.

Fig. 4 shows the surface morphology of gallium oxide obtained
by heating up under nitrogen atmosphere and then oxidizing under
air atmosphere at 900 °C for 9 hours. The sensitivity was obtained
by measuring the resistance change on switching back and forth
between 1 Lpm of the 5000ppm ethanol air stream and the dry air
stream. Figure 5 shows the variation of the resistance at a detection
temperature of 550oC. The results show that lower deposition rate
has higher resistance than that of higher deposition rate with a
sensitivity of 1.42 and 1.36, respectively.

and then oxidizing under air at 900oC for 9 hrs.

After oxidization, there forms a lot of small particles for the
film prepared at lower deposition rate, as show in Fig.4. The spacing

rate is faster or more stable, leading to a growth with orientation
preference and thus forming nanowires.
On the contrary, if no oxygen present in the atmosphere, gallium
will not oxidize to gallium oxide during the temperature rising
process. On introducing air into the quartz tube as the oven
temperature reaches 900 oC, the gallium reacts to form gallium oxide
very fast. Under this condition, the reaction rate of gallium will
be very high in every site or face and nanowires are hard to form.
All gallium will react within a short period in this condition and
large grains are hard to grow. Therefore, the grain sizes are smaller
and more uniform.
In addition, atmosphere in the oxidation process also affect the
resultant morphology. As the Ga film is heated up under N2 to 900
oC and then oxidized at a flux of gas mixture of N2 and O2 at a flow
rate of 100cc/min with a oxygen mole fraction of 2, 8, 12, 20 and
100%, respectively, there are some nanowires grown on the surface
at a oxygen of 2 %, as show in Fig. 7(a). As the oxygen ratio increases,
less nanowires forms and more flake like structure growth on the
surface as show in Fig.7 (b)~(e).

the sensitivity measurement is carried out using 5000ppm
ethanol-air mixture at a temperature of 550°C. The atomic ratio
of oxygen to gallium in the Ga2O3 film increases with the oxygen
concentration of the oxidation atmosphere. A higher ratio of oxygen
in the Ga2O3 film is observed if oxidation in pure oxygen.

was prepared by raising temperature under nitrogen and then
oxidizing under air for 9 hours.
The corresponding X-ray diffraction patterns show the flakes
structure having only β- Ga2O3; and better crystallinity is
obtained as temperature increases from 750 to 900oC as shown in

Ga2O3 films prepared by heating up under air atmospheres and then
oxidizing at 800 and 900 oC are N-type. But if the oxidation
temperature is raised to 1000 oC, the electrical property turns into
P-type. In addition, the Ga2O3 films prepared by heating up under
nitrogen atmosphere and then oxidizing at 800 oC are N-type. When
raising the oxidation temperature above 850 oC, the electrical
property turns into P-type. Therefore, as shown in Fig.14, the
electrical property of both Ga2O3 films prepared by heating up either
under air or under nitrogen trend to be P-type at higher oxidation
temperature.
FIG. 14 Variation of the sensitivity as a function of oxidation
temperature for Ga2O3 films prepared under air and N2 atmospheres
during temperature rising and oxidized at different temperature
for 9 hrs. Note that the sensitivity is defined as Rgas/Rair.
The defects always change the mechanical and physical properties
in materials. And concentration of defect is influenced by
temperature. The inner energy of crystals increases as defects form.
But it also increases the entropy and makes the crystal stable.
Therefore, there is an equilibrium concentration at a specific
temperature8.

prepared by raising temperature under nitrogen and then oxidizing
under air at 900 oC for 1 to 9 hrs.
G. Effect of the vapor concentration on the sensitivity
Theoretically, on increasing concentration of reducing vapor,
more adsorbed oxygen anions, O2- or O-, which are adsorbed on the
surface of Ga2O3 film, react with the reducing vapor, leading to
more electrons released and thus causing a larger change in the
resistance. In the study, the Ga2O3 films are tested using different
concentration (2000, 3000, and 5000ppm) of ethanol at 550 oC. As
shown in Fig.17, the sensitivities of the Ga2O3 films obviously

as a function of operation temperature for Ga2O3 films prepared under
N2atmosphere during heating up 900 oC and oxidized under air at 900
oC for 9 hrs.
I. Effect of the operating temperature on response and recovery
time
On contacting with the reducing gas, the sensor responds with
a decrease (or increase) in resistance with time and reaches a
steady-state value. If the reducing gas flow through the detection
tube is assumed to follow a continuous stirred tank reactor model,
the gas concentration inside the tube increases exponentially to
the inlet concentration. The response time (or recovery time) can
be described by the following:

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, gallium oxide thin film is prepared by rheotaxial
growth and thermal oxidation on SiO2 substrate. After oxidization,
the surface of gallium oxide forms a lot of small particles for
the gallium prepared at lower deposition rate. Small particles
increase the surface area of gallium oxide film, leading to more
absorption of gas molecules and thus higher sensitivity than that
prepared at higher deposition rate.
The grains trend to grow directionally and form nanowires for
the film prepared by heating up in the air atmosphere, and the
electrical property of theGa2O3 films is N type. On the other hand,
the grains trend to form flake if it is prepared by heating up in
the nitrogen atmosphere, and the electrical property of the Ga2O3
films is P type.
In addition the Ga2O3 film has higher sensitivity if it is
prepared by oxidizing under an atmosphere with higher oxygen
concentration, at higher oxidation temperature, or for longer
oxidation time. The gas sensors prepared at a deposition rates of
1~2 Å/s and 3~5 Å/s have a maximum sensitivity at 500 oC and 550
oC, respectively. Their sensitivity increases obviously with
