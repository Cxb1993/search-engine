2. PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL MODELS
As shown in Figure 1(a), the micro-nanofluidic system
under study consists of a nanochannel with length of L1 and
two microchannels connected at both ends of the
nanochannels having length of L2 and L3. The widths of the
microchannel and nanochannel are denoted as h and H,
respectively. The system is considered to be two-dimensional
by assuming the depths of the micro- and nanochannels are
much larger than their width. Reservoirs are connected at the
ends of the microchannels and the entire system is filled with
an aqueous salt electrolyte with bulk concentration 0c .
Without loss of generality, the walls of microchannel and
nanochannel are considered as negatively charged with
surface charge densities of m and n , respectively. It is
assumed that the water dissociation is very low and the
current is primarily due to the salt ions. Anode and cathode
are placed at the ends of the microchannels for applying the
electric field. The potential bias between the electrodes is
defined as 21   . Based on Figure 1(a), the
microchannel on the left-hand side can be regarded as the
anodic microchannel while the microchannel on the
right-hand side is referred as the cathodic microchannel. The
physical domain considered in this study is similar to that in
the studies of Daiguji et al. [21, 22] except that the infinite
reservoirs are replaced by two microchannels. It is also
similar to that in the study of Mirbozorgi et al. [23] except the
channel size shrinks to nanoscale. For such geometry, a
sudden contraction cross section is formed between the
anodic microchannel and the nanochannel and a sudden
expansion cross section is formed between the cathodic
microchannel and nanochannel. The surface charge density of
the side walls at the micro-nanochannel junction is dented
as s .
Fundamentally, there are two approaches to attack the
problem in micro/nanoscale dimension. One of them is based
on molecular dynamics in which the problem is formulated
from the molecular interactions [24]. The other approach is
based on continuum dynamics in which the problem is
formulated from macroscopic point of view. Following the
work of Jin et al. [20], the second approach will be adopted
because of its simplicity in formulation and solid physical
foundation. Although it may be over-simplified, it is believed
that the results are still adequate in describing the general
phenomena with acceptable accuracy in the macroscopic
engineering applications.
Based on above discussion, the governing equation
describing the fluid flow is the modified Navier-Stokes
equation written as,

where t , , V, p and  are the time, fluid density,
flow velocity vector, pressure in the flow field and the fluid
viscosity, respectively. The last term on the right-hand side of
Eq. (2b) is known as the electrical body force per unit volume
when the electrostriction and permittivity gradient in the
electrical field are ignored. e is the net charge density
defined as,

where F is the Faraday number, N is the number of ions in the
flow field, ic and iz are the molar concentration and the

results from the applied potential bias  , while the
potential gradient  results from the electrostatic
potential distribution due to the net charge density in the flow
field. These two potential fields are described by Laplace and
Poisson equations given as,

where iD and im are the molecular diffusivity and

Nernst-Einstein equation,

where R is the universal gas constant and T is the fluid

obtain the fluid velocity, ion concentration and electrical
potential distributions with appropriate boundary conditions.

  iiiii czVFcDzFi   (7)
where is the electrolyte conductivity defined as,

By integrating Eq. (7) through the channel cross section the
total current flowing through the system can be obtained. In
Eq. (7), the terms on the right-hand side are known as the
electromigrative, diffusive, and streaming currents,
respectively.
All governing equations were written in a two-dimensional
Cartesian coordinate system ( yx, ). The fluid velocity
components in the x and y-directions are u and v ,
respectively. The initial and boundary conditions are required
to solve Eqs. (1)-(5). Because of the geometrical symmetry
the computational domain is taken as half the physical
domain, as shown in Figure 1(b). Referring to Figure 1(b), the
boundary conditions for simulating the fluid flow velocity, ion
concentration and potential distributions are specified as

4.3 Transient behavior under various applied electric
potential biases
The system deviates from the Donnan equilibrium as the
potential bias is applied. It is expected that the system will
undergo a transient period before the steady state is reached.
To carry out the transient simulation, the results shown in
Figure 2 are used as the initial conditions to compute the
time-dependent ion concentration distribution, electric field,
fluid flow and current flow when the potential bias is applied.
To be specifically focus on the transient variation of the
system under various applied potential biases, the
nanochannel size and surface charge density are fixed as
H =20nm and n = 3105  C/m2. In Figure 3, the
transient fluid flow and ion distribution represented by the
streamline (red lines) and the cation contour (blue lines) are
shown. For  =0.5V case shown in Figure 3(a), there is no
vortex created in the flow field all the time. The enriched
cation at the nanochannel openings spreads out into the
microchannels as time increases and finally reaches a steady
state. As  increases to 5V as shown in Figure 3(b),
vortex starts to develop at the corner of the anodic
micro-nanochannel junction. The vortex size keeps increasing
as time increases further. Similar to the  =0.5V case, the
cation spreads out into the microchannels as time increases.
When vortex starts to develop, depletion of cation from the
nanochannel opening in the anodic channel becomes
significant. As the steady state is reached when time is greater
than 10-3 s, a region with very low cation concentration is
established near the anodic nano-microchannel junction. For
the region near the cathodic nano-microchannel junction,
cation depletion was not found. When the applied potential
bias increases to  =50V, Figure 3(c) shows that the vortex
generation can be found in earlier time as compared with the
 =5V case. It is also found that vortices appear not only in
the anodic channel but also in the cathodic channel at the
earlier times. The vortex in the cathodic channel disappears
while the vortex size in the anodic channel keeps increasing
as time increases further. The fluid flow and ionic distribution
reach a steady state as time increases beyond 10-3 s. As
compared with the  =5V case, the size of cation depletion
region becomes larger. The results shown in Figures 3(b) and
3(c) are completely different from the classical EOF in which
no vortex can be observed when the potential bias is applied.
This kind of EOF is termed as the EOF of the second kind [10,
11]. A more detail of time-dependent fluid flow and cation
depletion under various applied potential biases shown in
Figure 3 are provided in the supplemental material. It can be
seen that the time-dependent fluid flow and cation depletion
in the system is rather complicated before the steady-state is
reached. For applied potential bias increases beyond 50V, the
size of vortex is larger than the anodic channel length which
is physically violates the boundary conditions described in Eq.
(9). That is, under the system considered in the present study,
the maximum potential bias can be applied is approximately
50V.

Steady
6the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) in the study of
ion-selective membrane. From Figures 4(a) and 5(a), it is seen
that the regions of DBL increases with time and then finally
reach a steady state in both anodic and cathodic
microchannels [26]. As  increases to 5V as shown in
Figures 4(b) and 5(b), a region with very low ion
concentration close to the nanochannel opening in the anodic
microchannel is resulted when steady state is reached. This is
region is termed as the space charge layer (SCL) [26].
Because of existence of SCL, the thickness of the DBL in the
anodic channel is reduced. In opposite, higher ion
concentration is found at the region close to the nanochannel.
This is known as the ion enriched CP zone in which the ion
concentration linearly decreases to the bulk value at the end
of the cathodic microchannel. For  increases to 50V as
shown in Figures 4(c) and 5(c), the variation trends of ion
concentration is similar to the  =5V case except that the
size SCL is increased and thickness of DBL is decreased.
For better understanding on characteristics of the SCL, the
space charge density variation along the centerline of the
system corresponding to the results shown in Figure 3 are
presented in Figure 6. Recalling from the Donnan equilibrium
shown in Figure 2(c), the space charge density along the
centerline of the microchannel is zero because of no EDL
overlap. Figure 6 shows that non-zero space charge density
spreading from the nanochannel openings toward the anode
and cathode when the potential bias is applied. Based on the
results shown in Figure 8, the thickness of the SCL increases
with time in the anodic channel and depends on the potential
bias. A much thicker SCL can be developed when the
potential bias is high. In the cathodic channel, the SCL
thickness is about the same as that in the Donnan equilibrium
condition when steady-state is reached for all the potential
biases studied. Because of the non-zero charge density, the
electric body force in the flow field with concentration
polarization will be different from the conventional EOF in
which the non-zero space charge density exists only in the
region near charged surface and is electroneutral in the center
core of the channel. The electric body force combined with
the flow field geometry and requirement of momentum
balance results in the vortex generation in the flow field. As
mentioned earlier, the EOF with vortex termed as the EOF of
the second kind [10, 11].

4.4 Voltage-current characteristics with CP
Another important feature of the micro-nanofluidic system
is the effect of CP zone on the electric current-voltage (I-V)
characteristics in the flow field. From the results presented
above, the system reaches a steady-state for all the potential
biases studied. We therefore focus on the results of
8mechanism to stir the flow and consequently reduces the DBL
thickness. From the result shown in Figures 3 and 8, it is seen
that over-limiting current can only be obtained when vortex
appears in the flow field. This result agrees with the theory
proposed by Rubinstein and his co-workers [27-29].

5. CONCLUSION
In this study, transient EOF in a micro-nanofluidic system
consisting of sudden expansion and contraction cross sections
is numerically investigated. The effect of concentration
polarization on the fluid flow, induced pressure, and electric
current under various electric potential biases are numerically
investigated. The nanochannel wall is negatively charged and
therefore behaves like a cation-selective membrane. We
explained the fluid flow behavior from the characteristics of
electric body force that driving the fluid flow. The
concentration polarization phenomena found in such flow is
similar to those in the membrane-electrolyte system. It is
found that the non-zero space charge density appeared in the
anodic channel is responsible for generating the vortex flow
when the applied electric potential bias is high. The transient
velocity field indicates that velocity can be much higher than
the steady-state velocity during the vortex development.
Unlike the conventional EOF in microchannel, the induced
pressure in the system containing nanochannel has a positive
gradient in the anodic side of the system instead of negative
pressure gradient. The vortex in the anodic channel serves as
a stirring mechanism that reduces the DBL thickness and
results in over-limiting current when the applied potential bias
is high.
