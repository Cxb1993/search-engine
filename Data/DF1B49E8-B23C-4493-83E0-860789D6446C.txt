Abstract 
This project investigated the interaction of a piezoelectric screw dislocation with an arbitrarily 
shaped three-phase composite subjected to remote anti-plane shear and electric fields. Based on 
the methods of complex variable, conformal mapping, Faber series and Laurent series, the 
analytical complex potentials for all three regions can be expressed in series form with unknown 
coefficients. The continuity conditions of the interfaces are used to build up a set of linear 
equations to determine the unknown coefficients. After the unknown coefficients are solved, the 
stress, electric field and image force can be expressed explicitly. Numerical results will provide to 
show the effect of the inclusion shape, the material combinations on the electro-elastic fields and 
image force calculated through the generalized Peach-Koehler formula. The solutions proposed 
here can be served as kernel functions to analyze the corresponding piezoelectric cracking 
problems. 
Keywords: Piezoelectric material, Arbitrarily shaped inclusion, Screw dislocation, Faber series 
 
1. Introduction 
Due to the capability of the transfer between mechanical and electric energy, piezoelectric 
materials are used extensively in electromechanical devices such as actuators, sensors, and 
transducers. During the manufacture process, piezoelectric ceramics are brittle and likely to 
generate micro-defects such as dislocations, micro-cracks, cavities, inclusions, etc. The 
existences of various defects cause geometric discontinuities and induce high stress 
concentrations, which may greatly influence the performance of piezoelectric devices. Therefore, 
the mechanical stress analysis of piezoelectric materials with defects plays an important role in 
understanding the behavior and the performance of these devices. Pak (1992) investigated a 
circular piezoelectric inclusion embedded in an infinite piezoelectric matrix. Meguid and Zhong 
 4 
investigated the interaction between a screw dislocation and an arbitrary shaped elastic 
inhomogeneity with different material properties than the surrounding matrix. To our knowledge, 
the interaction between a screw dislocation and coated inclusion of arbitrary shape has not been 
recorded in the literature. This work is using the Faber series method to obtain the Green’s 
function for a three-phase arbitrarily shaped piezoelectric composite. 
2. Basic equations  
In a fixed rectangular coordinates system (x1, x2, x3), the basic equations for linear piezoelectric 
materials can be written as 
 
,
0ij jτ =  (1) 
 
,
0i iD =  (2) 
 
, ,
1 ( )
2ij i j j i
u uγ = +  (3) 
 
,i iE ϕ= −  (4) 
 ij ijkl kl kij jc e Eτ γ= −  (5) 
 i ikl kl ik kD e Eγ ε= +  (6) 
where the repeated indices mean summation and a comma stands for partial differentiation. 
ijklc , kije  and ikε  are the corresponding elastic, piezoelectric and dielectric constants, 
respectively. ijτ , iu , iD , ϕ , ijγ  and iE  are stress, displacement, electric displacement, 
electric potential, strain and electric field, respectively. Since the symmetry of the stress and strain 
tensor, and since the stress-strain relation in linear elasticity can be derived from a strain energy 
density function, the material constants satisfy the following symmetric relation: 
 ijkl klij ijlk jiklc c c c= = = ,  kij kjie e= ,  ik kiε ε=  
2.1. Anti-plane deformation 
In this paper, we consider a coated inclusion of arbitrary shape embedded in an infinite matrix 
subjected to anti-plane mechanical and in-plane electrical loadings (see Fig. 1). The matrix and 
the coated inclusion are assumed to be transversely isotropic and poled in the x3 direction. The 
anti-plane deformation is determined by the out-of-plane displacement u3 and the in-plane electric 
potential φ , and both are functions of x1 and x2 only, such that   
 1 2 3 3 1 2 1 20,     ( , ),     ( , )u u u u x x x xφ φ= = = =  
The governing equations (1) and (2) can be simplified to

15 3 11 0e u ε φ∇ − ∇ =  (8)

The complex potential ( )a zU  which is analytical in the region aΩ , can be expanded as a Faber

3.2. Boundary conditions 
The assumption of perfect bonding of the three-phase composite implies the continuities of 
generalized displacement and traction across the interfaces, which lead to the following 
conditions.

Truncating the above infinite system of linear algebraic equations at a large N terms, Eqs. (32) 
and (33) constitute a system of 2N linear equations to determine the 2N unknown coefficient 
vectors na and na . After na  are found the other unknown coefficient vectors nb , n−b and n−c  
can be easily found by the relations of Eqs. (28)-(31). 
 
3.4. Stress and electric field 
Once the complex potential for each component is determined, the stress and electric field of each 
component can be easily found from Eqs. (10) and (11).

( 0 5 /p MN m= , 30 10 /q C m−= ) located at 0 2z i= , Figs. 3-6 respectively show the normal 
shears along the interfaces of various shaped inclusions. Figs. 7-10 respectively show the 
tangential electric fields along the interfaces of various shaped inclusions. It is obvious that the 
magnitudes of the interfacial normal shear and tangential electric field in the upper plane (x2>0) 
are lager than those in the lower plane (x2<0), since the point force is applied at 0 2z i= . The 
maximum values of 3 0/n R pτ  and 11 0/
c
tE R qε  are listed in Table 1. Furthermore, we will 
investigate the effects of material constant combinations on the image force. The unbounded 
matrix is also assumed to be PZT-5H and the screw dislocation with Burgers vector 910zb m
−
=  
and electric potential jump 1.0Vφ∆ =  located at the point of the positive x1-axis. We first check 
the case of three-phase circular inclusion problem that is the special case of 0
n
m =  in Eq. 13. 
Figure 11 shows the variations of the image force with respect to the position of the dislocation 
for various elastic modulus of the interphase layer. Figure 12 shows the variations of the image 
force with respect to the position of the dislocation for various thicknesses of the interphase layer. 
These results are in agreement with those of Liu et al. (2004). Figures 13 and 14 show the 
variations of image force for various elastic modulus of the interphase layer. Fig. 15 shows the 
variations of image force for piezoelectric constant of the interphase layer. In these cases, the 
thickness of the interphase layer in the mapped plane is assumed to be 0.1. The positive image 
force represents the coated inclusion will repel the piezoelectric screw dislocation in the matrix 
and the negative image force represents the coated inclusion will attract the piezoelectric screw 
dislocation in the matrix. It can be observed that the coated inclusion will repel the piezoelectric 
screw dislocation in the matrix (positive image force) for 44 44b cc c>  or 15 15b ce e>  and will attract 
the piezoelectric screw dislocation in the matrix (negative image force) for 44 44b cc c<  or 15 15b ce e<  
when the dislocation is near to the interface. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The problem of a piezoelectric screw dislocation in an arbitrarily shaped three-phase composite is 
analyzed in the framework of linear piezoelectricity. Based on the methods of complex variable, 
conformal mapping, Faber series and Laurent series, the analytical complex potentials are derived
