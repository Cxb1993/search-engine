毒性含氯有機物污染之即時偵測及去除系統研發 
Abstract 
The hidden danger of Cl-containing volatile organic compounds (Cl-VOCs) may 
exacerbate the environment and human health.  ZnO thin films have been widely 
used in sensing of Cl-VOCs.  The main objective of this work was to investigate 
speciation of zinc in the IZO (indium-zinc-oxide) thin films during sensing of CCl4.  
The IZO thin films (synthesized by RF magnetron sputtering) contain 2.5% of indium 
with a thickness of 480 nm (determined by α-step).  X-ray diffraction patterns of the 
IZO films illustrate a preferred c-axis orientation of ZnO (002).  To further 
understand speciation of zinc in the IZO thin films, the in-situ EXAFS spectra of zinc 
were measured during sensing of 350 ppm CCl4.  Zinc in the IZO thin films at 300 K 
possesses a Zn-O bond distance of 1.972 Å with a CN (coordination number) of 3.2.  
At 623 K, the bond distance of Zn-O in the thin film is increased by 0.022 Å.  As 
350 ppm of CCl4 is introduced onto the thin film, the bond distance of Zn-O is 
decreased slightly (1.978 Å) and restored to 1.991 Å in the absence of CCl4. 
The ZnO thin films were also synthesized by the self assembling method.  To 
enhance sensitivity of the ZnO thin films, Fe3+ was doped onto the ZnO (Fe/ZnO) thin 
films.  The X-ray absorption near edge structural (XANES) spectra shows that ZnO 
is the main zinc species in the Fe/ZnO thin films.  During sensing of ethanol, the 
in-situ extended X-ray absorption fine structural (EXAFS) spectra indicate that the 
bond distances of Zn-O and Fe-O are 1.90 and 1.98 Å, and restored to 1.91 and 1.97 
Å, respective in the absence of ethanol.  The thin film containing 5% of Fe has a 
high sensitivity (Rair/Rethanol>80) when sensing of ethanol at 300 K.  On the contrary, 
the thin films with Fe fractions of 20-50% have a very low sensitivity to ethanol 
(Rair/Rethanol<15).  In the presence of ethanol, the EXAFS spectra show that the bond 
distances of Zn-O and Fe-O in the thin films are 1.90 and 1.98 Å, respectively and 
restored to 1.91 and 1.97 Å in the absence of ethanol.

sensitivity to ethanol vapor [11].  However, the working temperatures of these 
sensors are in the range of 673-773 K with fair selectivity [12].  To improve 
sensitivity, transition metals were frequently doped onto ZnO thin films [13].  
Doping with transition metals can enhance the stability and sensitivity [14].   
Many methods have been used to prepare thin films, such as plasma enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), sputtering, spray 
pyrolysis, and sol-gel methods [15].  The sol-gel method has several advantages 
including relatively homogeneous composition, easy control of film thickness and 
fine and porous microstructure of the synthesized thin films. 
Sensing of chlorinated methanes (CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and CCl4) has been a very 
attractive topic.  For instance, tin oxide pellets [16], lanthanum materials [17], screen 
printed La2O3 doped tin oxide films [18], indium tin oxide thin films [19], 
multicomponent oxides thin film [20], plasma-treated SnO2 thick film [21], and SnO2 
thin film prepared by thermal oxidation [22] have been used as he chlorinated sensors.  
The electrical conductances of SnO2-based to CCl4 have a unique dual response due 
to different adsorption and desorption characteristics [16].  When exposure to CCl4 
the conductance of the La2O3-doped tin oxide thin film decreased at T<573 K and 
increased at T>623 K [18].  The sensitivity to CHCl3 is greater than that to CH2Cl2.  
The indium tin oxide (ITO) polycrystalline thin film reaches a maximum sensitivity at 
448 K [19].  The thinner films (about 100 nm) exhibit a higher sensitivity to CCl4 
than the thick films.  Note that the sensor must be operated at a temperature above 
the boiling point of CCl4 (349 K) to avoid condensation of CCl4 on the surfaces.  
Ternary compounds such as Zn2In2O5 and MgIn2O4 have a higher sensitivity than 
those using binary compounds such as ZnO and In2O3 [20].  Zn2In2O5 and MgIn2O4 
thin films have a decrease in conductance with exposure to CCl4.  A high sensitivity 
for CCl4 gas was found on multicomponent oxide (Zn2In2O5- MgIn2O4) thin films at 
573 K.  The increase in resistance may be caused by an increasing number of trapped 
electrons due to the enhancement of oxygen adsorption or the adsorption of CCl4.  
Subsequently, free electrons are trapped by the adsorbed CCl4 and lead to an increase 
of resistance.  Effect of oxygen plasma and dopants of tin oxide thick film gas 
sensors for detector of select gases have been studied [21].  The main bottleneck for 
tin oxide sensors need of operation at high temperatures.  It has found that the 
sensitivity at room temperature of oxygen plasma-treated array is much higher than 
the untreated ones.  Pt-doped sensors have a high sensitivity to CO and LPG, 
whereas the Pd-doped sensor is sensitive toward CCl4 and C3H7OH.  The Cd-doped 
sensor has found to have equally good response to the four gases while the CuO- and 
ZnO-doped sensors have relatively low.  The increase of non-stoichiometry of tin 
oxide causes a decrease in the d.c. resistance and a higher sensitivity.  As the device 
is exposed to plasma oxygen, the increasing number of oxygen vacancies has 
shortened the response time.  Tin oxide thin films prepared by thermal oxidation of 
Sn have been used to detect chlorinated methanes (CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and CCl4) [22].  
The thin film has a slow response to CH2Cl2 and a fast response to CHCl3 and CCl4.  
However, the response of the thin film was irreproducible and irregular at 673 K, 
which was believed to be due to different catalytic reactions on the surfaces of the 
sensor film.  The thin film can detect other chlorinated methanes as recovery from 
CCl4 detection of CCl4.   
ZnO thin films have been widely used as sensors of select vapors.  However, 
speciation and reaction paths during sensing are still not well understood.  Thus, the

2. EXPERIMENTAL 
The TCO thin film sensors used in this experiment were prepared by RF magnetron 
sputtering.  The thin films were co-deposited on glass substrates using 3-inches 
indium and zinc targets.  The distance between target and substrate was 45 mm.  
Sputtering deposition was carried out in a mixture of argon (Ar) and oxygen (O2) 
gases.  The background pressure was 2 × 10-5 Torr and the total pressure of the 
gases was adjusted to 10 mTorr during sputtering process.  The working RF and DC 
powers of indium and zinc were 40 and 70 W, respectively. 
The ZnO thin films were prepared by dissolving zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO2)·2H2O] 
(OSAKA) in 2-Methoxyethanol (MERCK) (0.5 M), in which a surfactant, 
monothanolamine (MEA) (WAKO), was subsequently added.  The molar ratio of 
MEA to zinc acetate was 0.02.  The sol gels were stirred at 333 K for 30 min.  The 
thin films were prepared by the self assembling method with a speed of 2 cm/day.  
The synthesized thin films were annealed in N2 at 773 K for one hour.

The sol gels which for synthesis of the ZnO-Fe thin films with self assembling 
method were prepared by dissolving zinc acetate [Zn(CH3COO2)·2H2O] (OSAKA) 
and Fe2O3 (MERCK, 99%) in 2-Methoxyethanol (MERCK) (0.5 M), in which a 
surfactant, monothanolamine (MEA) (WAKO), was subsequently added.  The molar 
ratio of MEA to zinc acetate was 0.02.  The sol gels were stirred at 333 K for 30 min 
till well mixed.  The thin films were prepared by the self assembling method with a 
speed of 2 cm/day.  The synthesized thin films were annealed at 573 K for 10 min 
and 673-873 K for one hour. 
The ZnO-Fe thin films were prepared by dissolving Zn(CH3COO)2 2H‧ 2O and 
Fe(NO3)3 9H‧ 2O in 2-methoxyethanol, in which a surfactant, monoethanolamine 
(MEA), was subsequently added.  The molar ratio of MEA (monoethanolamine) to 
zinc acetate was 0.02.  The fractions of Fe in the thin films were 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 
0.5, respectively.  The solutions were be stirred for 30 min at 333 K.  The thin films 
were prepared by dip-coating in a home-made slow pulling system with the speed of 
1.2 cm/day.  The thin film samples were preheated at 523 K for 10 min to 
decompose organic compounds and annealed at 773 K for 60 min. 
The thickness and composition of the thin films was determined by a stylus 
roughness detector (Alpha-step 200, Tensor Instruments) and Rutherford 
backscattering spectrometry (RBS), respectively.  Crystallographic structures of the 
thin films were examined with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy 
(RINT-2000, Rigaku) with a CuKα radiation. Samples were scanned from 10˚ to 80˚ 
(2θ) at 30 kV and 40 mA with a scanning rate of 4˚ /min.  A scanning electron 
microscope (SEM) (S-3000N, Phillips) was employed to determine the surface 
morphology.   
The Zn K-edge EXAFS spectra of the thin films were recorded on the Wiggler 
BL17C beamline at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC).  
The electron storage ring was operated at energy of 1.5 GeV (ring current = 80-200 
mA).  A Si (III) double-crystal monochromator was used for selection of energy.  
The energy resolution △E/E of the beamline was about 1.9 × 10-4 (eV/eV).  The 
photon energy was calibrated by characteristic preedge peaks in the absorption of Zn 
foil (9659 eV).  The absorption spectra were collected using ion chambers, which

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 In-situ EXAFS studies of zinc in the IZO thin films during sensing of CCl4 
Thickness of the IZO thin films (synthesized by RF magnetron sputtering) 
measured by α-step was 480 nm.  The composition of the thin films was also 
determined by RBS (Rutherford backscattering spectrometry).  Composition of Zn, 
In, and O in the thin films was 2.53, 45.54, and 51.93%, respectively with a In/Zn 
ratio of 0.056. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the thin films are shown in Figure 3.1.1.  The 
IZO films illustrate a preferred c-axis orientation of ZnO (002).  Similar 
observations were also reported by Zhang and coworkers [25].

The in-situ EXAFS spectra of zinc in the IZO thin films (In/Zn = 0.056) during 
sensing of 350 ppm CCl4 in air (200 mL/min) were recorded and analyzed in the k 
range of 3.5-12.5 -1.  >95% reliability of the Fourier-transformed EXAFS data fitting 
for zinc was found.  The Debye-Waller factors (Δσ2) were less than 0.01 Å2 in all 
EXAFS data analysis.  In Table 3.1.1, zinc in the IZO thin films (at 300 K) possesses 
a Zn-O bond distance of 1.972 Å with a CN (coordination number) of 3.2.  However, 
at 623 K, the bond distance of Zn-O in the thin films is increased by 0.022 Å, which is 
may be related to the thermal shaking of surface species.  As 350 ppm CCl4 was 
introduced onto the thin film, the Zn-O bond distance is decreased slightly (1.978 Å).  
In the absence of CCl4, the bond distance of Zn-O is restored to 1.991Å.

3.2 Sensing of CCl4 with nanosize ZnO thin films 
The least-square fitted XANES spectra of zinc in the ZnO thin films are shown in 
Figure 3.2.1.  The main zinc species in the thin films are nanosize ZnO (95%) and 
ZnO (5%).  After introduction of CCl4 (1000 ppm) onto the thin film for about 30 
min at 333 K, a small amount of metallic Zn (5%) (at 9659 eV) is found (Figure 
3.2.1(b)).  During sensing, adsorption of CCl4 onto ZnO (electron withdraw of ZnO 
by CCl4) may occur.  As expected, in the absence of CCl4, little metallic zinc in the 
thin film can be observed (Figure 3.2.1(c)).

In the presence of 300-1000 ppm of Cl-VOCs (CCl4, CHCl3, and CH2Cl2), the 
sensitivities of the thin films has been determined and is shown in Figure 3.2.3.  It 
seems that the sensitivity of the thin film increases as the concentration of the 
Cl-VOCs increases.  Of which the thin film can sense of 6 to 300 ppm of CCl4 or 
comparatively to 700 ppm of CHCl3.  Note that the thin film can sense the CH2Cl2 
vapor as its concentrations is greater than 1000 ppm.

3.4 Sensing of ethanol with ZnO-Fe thin films 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the ZnO-Fe (Fe=0-50%) thin films are 
illustrated in Figure 3.4.1.  For the low fractions (0-0.1) of Fe in the ZnO thin films, 
the main compound in the thin films is ZnO.  As the fractions of Fe are > 0.2, in 
addition to ZnO, ZnFe2O4 is also observed.  By SEM, it is found that the thin film is 
consistent of nano sized ZnO that are packed closely and well-distributed (Figure 
3.4.2).  The mean particle size in the thin film is about 200 nm.

3.5 A preliminary design of personal real-time Cl-VOCs sensing system 
combined with mineralization 
In the previous studies [26], effective methods for mineralization of CCl4 with CuO 
to yield stable inorganic species such as CO2 and CuCl2 (CCl4 + 2CuO → 2CuCl2 + 
CO2) was well developed.  At 513-603 K, high conversions (63-83%) of CCl4 during 
mineralization with CuO or Na2C2O4 were found.  During mineralization, organic Cl 
in Cl-VOCs was converted into nontoxic inorganic states. 
    A preliminary design of the personal real-time sensing system combined with 
mineralization process is shown in Figure 3.5.1.  The conceptual design of the 
sensing/mineralization system was based on the experimental data for sensing of 
Cl-VOCs.  For utilization in personal protection, the system became very simple, 
inexpensive, miniaturized and portable. 
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gold and platinum are used as electron materials to provide good electric 
conduction [4].  The electrodes adhesion layers usually used for better adhesion, 
such as 20 nm Ti adhesion layer for deposition of platinum [27].  Heater and 
thermometer can be performed as horizontal approach or vertical approach.  In the 
former, the heater and thermometer were in the same layer with the electrodes 
whereas the letter was opposite.  The horizontal approach does not need additional 
process step to form heating structures, while the vertical approach allows much more 
freedom.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
The IZO (2.5% In) thin films synthesized by RF magnetron sputtering have a 
thickness of 480 nm (determined by α-step).  X-ray diffraction patterns of the IZO 
thin films illustrate a preferred c-axis orientation of ZnO (002).  In-situ EXAFS 
spectra of zinc in the IZO thin films were measured during sensing of 350 ppm CCl4.  
Zinc in the IZO thin films at 300 K possesses a Zn-O bond distance of 1.972 Å with a 
CN of 3.2.  At 623 K, the bond distance of Zn-O in the thin film is increased by 
0.022 Å.  During adsorption of CCl4 on the IZO thin films, the bond distance of 
Zn-O is decreased slightly (1.978 Å).  The bond distance of Zn-O is restored to 
1.991 Å in the absence of CCl4. 
Since Cl is a strong electron affinity element, a partial positive charge may occur on 
the C in CCl4, CHCl3 or CH2Cl2.  During sensing, the Cl-VOCs may be adsorbed 
onto oxygen on the ZnO thin film.  The electron withdrawing process may be 
expressed as follows: 
Zn - O …> CClnH4-n (n=0-2) 
As observed by XANES, adsorption of CCl4 onto O of ZnO led to formation of 
metallic zinc on the surface of the thin film.  In addition electron withdrawn form 
oxygen in ZnO by the adsorbed CCl4 may also cause more negative partial charge of 
the oxygen and lead to reduction of the Zn-O bond distance (as observed by EXAFS).    
The chemical interactions between oxygen (ZnO) and adsorbed Cl-VOCs are, 
therefore, significantly influenced by the nuclear of Cl atoms in the Cl-VOCs.  More 
Cl atoms (or less H atoms) in the Cl-VOCs may enhance the interactions with oxygen 
of ZnO, and as expected, increase the sensitivity of the ZnO thin films.   
Main species in the of ZnO-Fe thin film are ZnO, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4.  The thin film 
is consisted of mainly nanosize particles.  The least-square fitted XANES spectra 
also shows that the fractions of main spices in the ZnO-Fe thin film are ZnO (100%), 
Fe2O3 (53%) and Fe3O4 (47%).  By in-situ EXAFS spectroscopy, we found that the 
bond distances of Fe-O and Zn-O were 1.98 and 1.90 Å during sensing of 300 ppm 
ethanol and restored to 1.97 and 1.91 Å, respectively in the absence of ethanol vapor. 
The main compound in the ZnO-Fe thin films is ZnO as the fractions of Fe in the 
thin films are <10%.  Increasing of the fractions of Fe to 20% in the thin films, ZnO 
and ZnFe2O4 are the main compounds.  The thin film containing 5% of Fe has a high 
sensitivity (Rair/Rethanol>80) when sensing of ethanol at 300 K.  Compared with the 
ZnO thin film, the sensitivity is increased by 1.5 times.  On the contrary, the thin 
films with Fe fractions of 20-50% have a very low sensitivity to ethanol 
(Rair/Rethanol<15).  In the presence of ethanol, the EXAFS spectra show that the bond 
distances of Zn-O and Fe-O in the thin films are 1.90 and 1.98 Å, respectively and 
restored to 1.91 and 1.97 Å in the absence of ethanol
