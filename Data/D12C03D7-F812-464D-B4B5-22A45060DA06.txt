Abstract—This paper proposes a dynamic output feedback
sliding mode control algorithm for linear MIMO systems with
mismatched norm-bounded uncertainties along with
disturbances and matched nonlinear perturbations. A control
law is first designed to ensure that the system behavior can
satisfy the reaching and sliding condition. A scheme designed
to combine the output-dependent integral sliding surface with a
full-order compensator is then proposed. Through utilizing H
control analytical technique, once the system is in the sliding
mode, the proposed algorithm can guarantee robust
stabilization and sustain the nature of performing disturbance
attenuation when the solutions to two algebraic Riccati
inequalities can be found. Finally, the feasibility of our
proposed algorithm is illustrated using a numerical example.

I. INTRODUCTION
Sliding mode control has attracted much attention partly
because of its absolute robustness to the so-called matched
uncertainties and disturbances [15]. During early expeditions
of developing sliding mode control, it was based upon the
premise that all of the system state has become accessible. In
many systems, only the system output is available and therefore,
this condition limits the practical applicability of such schemes.
Fundamentally, there are two approaches to designing output
feedback sliding mode control (OFSMC). First, one has to
directly utilize the system output to design a controller [6, 8,
11]. Secondly, a state observer has to be constructed to
estimate the system state [7, 19]. Seeking insight into the
characteristics of the control theory and application, Edwards
and Spurgeon [7] presented the conditions by synthesizing
output feedback controllers for linear MIMO systems with
matched disturbances based on the sliding mode concepts.
However, all the aforementioned methods are not applicable to
systems with mismatched uncertainties.
For a system with mismatched uncertainty, Cao and Xu [2]
developed a state-dependent integral sliding surface design in
which the system maintains on the sliding surface from the
initial moment. Therefore, the method obtains the more robust
property than the traditional design with reaching phase.
Recently, Choi [4] proposed a static output-dependent sliding
surface design developed from linear matrix inequality (LMI)
technique [1]. By analogy, Yan et al. [18] applied a dynamical
observer to estimate the system state and designed a sliding
surface to be used in augmented space. Further, Park et al. [12]
extended Choi’s method [4] and proposed a dynamical output
feedback variable structure control law to deal with the same
problem. Since the dynamics of the sliding surface is always
related to the unmeasured system state, the high gain control [4,
11, 12] is introduced to achieve the global convergence. Upon
examining the static output feedback, Xiang et al. [17] applied
an iterative LMI technique to avoid the high gain problem. In
preparation for obtaining a bounded L2 gain performance,
Juang and Lee [10] developed an observer-based OFSMC
which can guarantee the system stability with robust
performance. Although these papers [4, 10, 12] have
demonstrated to use the switching control to guarantee the
convergence, the system state is not assured to be driven to the
sliding surface in finite time. Although the advantage of using
LMI technique to OFSMC for uncertain systems has been
addressed explicitly in these aforementioned papers, the
solutions including the constrained LMIs [4, 12] or a set of
LMIs [10, 17] are unfavorable difficultly to be obtained.
In this paper, an OFSMC method with guarantied
disturbance attenuation for linear MIMO systems with
mismatched norm-bounded uncertainties along with
disturbances and matched nonlinear perturbation is proposed.
The disturbance attenuation problem [13, 16] encountered was
affiliated with designing a feedback control law to ensure that
the effect of the disturbance acting on a system is reduced to an
accepted level. As a whole, Hoptimization technique [13, 16,
20] or LMI approach [1] is an effective method to be used for
solving this problem of which the design objective is to
minimize the gain from disturbance input to the controlled
output covering all frequencies. However, these OFSMC
methods for uncertain systems [4, 6-8, 11, 12, 17-19] do not
consider the problem caused by disturbance attenuation. In this
work, we extend Cao and Xu’s method [2] to propose an
output-dependent integral sliding surface design consisting of a
full-order compensator and incorporating into the specification
of disturbance attenuation. Once the system is in the sliding
mode, applying Hcontrol analyzing technique, the proposed
method can guarantee robust stability with disturbance
attenuation where the existence condition is determined by
solving two algebraic Riccati inequalities which are to be
involved with their original system parameters. Without
>disturbance attenuation once the system is in the sliding mode.
In this work, we extend Cao and Xu’s method [2] to the system
with regard to which only the output information is obtainable.

stay in the sliding mode. From (7) and (12), the equivalent

Our objective is to design v in such a way that robust

Remark 2: To better design OFSMC in uncertain systems,
Choi [4] proposed the existence problem of the static
output-dependent sliding surface through solving the constraint
of matrix inequalities. However, there is no systematic solution
method found to solve this formula. Yan et al. [18] studied this
problem by using the sliding mode observer and the
transformation matrix. When a set of LMIs with satisfying
some conditions has solutions, an observed-based OFSMC
proposed by Juang and Lee [10] can guarantee robust
performance. The two Riccati inequalities (30) and (31)
proposed in this paper were designed to be involved original
system matrix parameters only without requiring any
transformation. Moreover, the inequalities (30) and (31) are
not mutually coupled and therefore can be easily solved by
LMI technique [1].

depicts the control input u and the response of ( )s t . Figure 3
demonstrates the trajectory of e. From Figure 1, although the
nominal system has uncertain term and mismatched
disturbance, the response of the system output has good
performance. Hence, the robust disturbance attenuation can be
guaranteed once the system is in the sliding layer.
V. CONCLUSIONS
A dynamic sliding mode method is proposed by employing
output feedback only to place the effect of disturbance
attenuation on a linear MIMO uncertain system having
mismatched disturbance and matched nonlinear perturbation.
By putting together the design of using output-dependent
integral sliding surface and full-order compensator, the
characteristics of disturbance attenuation to alleviate the
fluctuation can guarantee great strength of robust stability once
the system is in the sliding mode. When there exist solutions to
two algebraic Riccati inequalities, the matrix parameters
obtained are well-suited to satisfy the property of disturbance
attenuation. Our proposed method is simple in nature with
involvements of its original system matrices only. Furthermore,
LMI technique can be applied as well in solving the
inequalities. A control law is used to ensure that the system can
maintain on the sliding surface. The numerical example also
demonstrates that the proposed algorithm should successfully
be implemented.

we get into the system stability analysis in the sliding mode.
Suppose that the system has been successfully controlled to
stay in the sliding mode. From (7) and (12), the equivalent

controllability, it follows that the pair  ,A B is controllable.
Our objective is to design v in such a way that robust
disturbance attenuation (5) can be achieved when the system is
in the sliding mode. Therefore, for system (14), robust

Remark 2: To better design OFSMC in uncertain systems,
Choi [4] proposed the existence problem of the static
output-dependent sliding surface through solving the constraint
of matrix inequalities. However, there is no systematic solution
method found to solve this formula. Yan et al. [18] studied this
problem by using the sliding mode observer and the
transformation matrix. When a set of LMIs with satisfying
some conditions has solutions, an observed-based OFSMC
proposed by Juang and Lee [10] can guarantee robust
performance. The two Riccati inequalities (30) and (31)
proposed in this paper were designed to be involved original
system matrix parameters only without requiring any
transformation. Moreover, the inequalities (30) and (31) are
not mutually coupled and therefore can be easily solved by
LMI technique [1].

illustrate the simulation results using the initial state
 (0) 1 1 0 T x and  (0) 0 0 0 Tz . The time
response of the system output is shown in Figure 1. Figure 2
depicts the control input u and the response of ( )s t . Figure 3
demonstrates the trajectory of e. From Figure 1, although the
nominal system has uncertain term and mismatched
disturbance, the response of the system output has good
performance. Hence, the robust disturbance attenuation can be
guaranteed once the system is in the sliding layer.
V. CONCLUSIONS
A dynamic sliding mode method is proposed by employing
output feedback only to place the effect of disturbance
attenuation on a linear MIMO uncertain system having
mismatched disturbance and matched nonlinear perturbation.
By putting together the design of using output-dependent
integral sliding surface and full-order compensator, the
characteristics of disturbance attenuation to alleviate the
fluctuation can guarantee great strength of robust stability once
the system is in the sliding mode. When there exist solutions to
two algebraic Riccati inequalities, the matrix parameters
obtained are well-suited to satisfy the property of disturbance
attenuation. Our proposed method is simple in nature with
involvements of its original system matrices only. Furthermore,
LMI technique can be applied as well in solving the
inequalities. A control law is used to ensure that the system can
maintain on the sliding surface. The numerical example also
demonstrates that the proposed algorithm should successfully
be implemented.
