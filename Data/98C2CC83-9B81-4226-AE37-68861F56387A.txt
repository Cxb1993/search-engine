CRs. Our development is first by 
the polynomial model of the CRs across the sub-
channels of the orthogonal 
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. 
The polynomial coefficients 
are extracted as the parameters of CRs. To 
efficiently feed back the large amount of 
the polynomial coefficients for the wideband systems 
of multiple-input multiple output 
(MIMO) with OFDM transmission, we consider efficient 
quantization algorithms based 
on the Gaussian quantization (GQ), Delta modulation 
(DM), and the recursive least squares 
(RLS) method. The performance of our algorithms are 
evaluated based on 
the mean-square error (MSE) of the fed-back 
regressional polynomial coefficients, and 
the channel capacity. The simulation results show 
that some of the proposed algorithms could attain the 
upper bound of channel capacity of the MIMO-OFDM 
system with low feedback load in the time- and 
frequency- selective channel. We also consider a 
feedback algorithm based on the B-spline models of 
channel responses (CRs) variation across subchannels. 
The simulation results verify that the proposed B-
spline model has smaller coefficients variances, and 
this leads to smaller mean-squares error than the 
Polynomial model when using fewer number of feedback 
bits. 
 
On the other hand, many wireless devices can not 
support multiple antennas due 
to size or other constraints. Cooperative diversity 
enables single antenna mobiles in 
a multi-user environment to share their antennas and 
generate a virtual multipleantenna 
transmitter that allows them to achieve spatial 
diversity. In this report, we 
consider some schemes of cooperative communication 
with network coding based on 
the orthogonal frequency-division multiple access 
(OFDMA) system. We adopt decodeand-

the frequency correlation and provide the Grassmann manifold method to estimate the
unknown beamforming vectors by interpolation. The concept of frequency correlation
also appeared in MIMO-OFDM [17]-[18] by cluster and sub-codebook methods, and
recursive and trellis-based methods, respectively, to reduce the feedback load. The
MIMO-OFDM system with time-frequency selectivity was presented in [19] to explain
the related beamforming vectors between frames and sub-channels through the pro-
posed successive beamforming method.
However, for a system with power allocation in the transmitter, there are few dis-
cussions about the extra gain from the feedback of channel responses (CR), which are
also the essential part of the CSI. In an MIMO-OFDM system with Lsc sub-channels,
for each transceiver antenna pair the receiver needs to feed back Lsc × Bc bits to the
transmitter during the time slot of one OFDM symbol, where Bc is the number of
quantized bits for the CR of a sub-channels. For the case of antenna selection in the
narrowband system, [20] indicates that the transmitter needs extra load
∑Nt
i=1
(

)
to
select the substream. When applying the antenna selection in the wideband system,
the feedback load will be broaden by Lsc times.
In this report, therefore, we will propose a parametric method to reduce the feedback
load of CRs of the MIMO-OFDM system. The proposed parametric method is based on
the regressional polynomial model of the selective fading CRs across sub-channels. The
polynomial coefficients, which are served as the parameters of channels, are determined
by the least-square fitting (LSF) approach [23]. The transmitter could rebuild the CRs
based on the fed-back polynomial coefficients. To efficiently feed back the coefficients
by the digital transmission, we need to further apply quantization. Due to the complex
Gaussian distribution of the CRs and the polynomial coefficients, we first consider the
Gaussian quantization (GQ). Then we further utilize the correlation of CRs across
time slots of OFDM symbols and proposed the Delta modulation (DM)- and recursive
least-squares- (RLS) based quantizations. These two approaches do not feed back
directly the coefficients but the related differential terms such that the transmitter
could rebuilt the coefficients and CRs. We also consider the channel phase rotation to
increase the feedback performance, and the prediction method to reduce the amount of
CSI feedback. Under the reasonable feedback load, the simulations show that by our

To break through the bandwidth bottleneck, network coding has been recently applied
to wireless relay networks. Furthermore, the network coding can be applied on co-
operative diversity [31][32]. Many detection schemes have been proposed for the DF,
but it has been shown that the cooperative maximum ratio combining (C-MRC) [37]
can achieve almost the same performance as the optimum likelihood detector [35] and
has a much lower complexity. In this report, we focus on the low-complexity decoding
combining method, we combine the C-MRC with the network coding, and show that it
achieves the full diversity order in multi-user one relay condition. And then we extend
our investigation to multi-user multi-relay networks. We combine with source and relay
symbols form as a kind of cooperative code, join with LDPC code with small matrix,
develop a effective way that can make a tradeoff between the achievable diversity order
and the data rate. We show that network coding offers improved diversity, bandwidth
efficiency and more design flexibility in wireless networks.

× (Ld + 1), and [Q]jk = jk, − Lsc2Lp ≤ j < Lsc2Lp , 0 ≤ k ≤ Ld. After
ci(t)’s are determined, the receiver could feed back these ci(t)’s to the transmitter. For
the fast fading channel, we may need to feed back ci(t) for almost every time slot t,
while for the slowly fading channel, ci(t)’s are nearly constant for several time slots
and we can feed back only one ci(t) for several time slots. Since the the degree Ld of
polynomials are usually chosen much smaller than the segment length Lsc
Lp
, the number
of feedback coefficients for each OFDM block s(t) is Lp(Ld+1), which is usually much
smaller than Lsc, the original number of CRs.
The above parametric method can be extended to MIMO-OFDM systems. For an
MIMO-OFDM systems with Nt transmit antennas and and Nr receive antennas, we
need to feedback the polynomial coefficient vector c(t) for each antenna pairs. The
number of fed-back coefficients is NtNrLp(Ld + 1), which may be a huge load for
feedback transmission. Since the polynomial coefficients are complex numbers, quanti-
zation is necessary for efficient digital feedback transmission. In the following section,
we will propose efficient quantization approaches, and further processing algorithms to
reduce the feedback load.
2.2 CSI Parameterization based on B-Splines
For each pair of MIMO transceiver, since the CRs are correlated among neighboring
subchannels, we can develop efficient approaches to feed back the estimated CRs in the
receiver to the transmitter. We assume the CRs among different transceiver antennas
are independent. In the following, we first briefly introduce the B-splines, then we
use B-splines to model the CRs variation across the subchannels of the MIMO-OFDM
system. The coefficients of the B-splines are quantized and fed back such that the
transmitter can reconstruct the CRs.
2.2.1 The B-splines
A B-spline of order n, denoted by Bn(t), is an n-fold convolution of the B-spline of
zero order Bo(t)[24]. For n = 0, 1, 2 we have the following B-splines.

expressed as
hˆi = Qci, ci = [ci1, ..., cim]

determined by the least-squares-fitting principle such that each ‖hi−hˆi‖2 is minimized,

We can solve the coefficients vector ci as
ci = (Q
TQ)−1QThi = Phi, (2.11)
where the matrix P = (QTQ)−1QT .
After ci’s are determined, the receiver can feed back these ci’s to the transmitter
with the quantization process. The number of feedback coefficients for each OFDM
block h is Npm, which is usually much smaller than Nc, the original number of CRs

2.3 Efficient CSI Feedback Algorithms
In the following, we assume that the true CRs are available in the receiver for easy
development of our algorithm. Since each coefficient vector ci(t) is linear function of
the complex Gaussian distributed CRs h(t;m)’s, each [ci(t)]k, 0 ≤ k ≤ Ld, is also
complex Gaussian distributed. This implies that Gaussian quantization (GQ) can be
applied on each [ci(t)]k. We can construct the optimized codebook based on the nearest
neighborhood condition (NNC) and the centroid condition (CC). For conciseness, we
neglect the indices of time slots and segments, and denote each [ci(t)]k just by [c]k.
The GQ algorithm is applied in both the real and imaginary parts of each [c]k. Let cR
and cI denote the real and imaginary parts of c, then we can write the corresponding
GQ algorithm as follows.
NNC : | [cˆR]jk − [cR]k | ≤ | [cˆR]lk − [cR]k |,
j, l = 1, · · · , 2Bc
CC : [cˆR]
j
k = the average of [cR]k, for [cR]k in (2.14)
the jth section,
and similarly for the imaginary parts cI and cˆI . In (2.14) Bc is the number of fed-
back bits of each [cR]k or [cI ]k, and the quantization coefficients [cˆR]
j
k and [cˆI ]
j
k are
the average of all [cR]k and [cI ]k, respectively, in the jth section. The GQ algorithm
executes NCC and CC recursively until each quantization coefficient [cˆ]jk converges.
The convergent [cˆ]jk’s are used to establish the the codebook, which is stored at both
the transmitter and the receiver. After the codebook is available, the receiver could feed
back the quantized index j corresponding to each [cR]k or [cI ]k , and the transmitter
10
in the receiver. Using the fed-back βi,k(t), the transmitter could rebuild the kth element
of estimated ci(t) by
[cˆi(t)]k = [cˆi(t− 1)]k + µβi,k(t). (2.19)
RLS-based Algorithm
For the DM-based algorithm, though the one-bit step size could significantly re-
duce the feedback load, it is also sensitive to the channel-variation when the Doppler
frequency is large. In addition, with the one-bit of ℜ{βi,k(t)} or ℑ{βi,k(t)} it could not
effectively reduce var{[ci(t)]k− [cˆi(t−1)]k−µβi,k(t)}. Therefore, we further propose an
RLS-based algorithm such that the transmitter could efficiently update the estimate of
[ci(t)]k. For this algorithm, based on the RLS principle the receiver processes [ci(t)]k
as follows.
ϵi,k(t) = [ci(t)]k −wHi,k(t− 1)ui,k(t− 1), with
ui,k(t− 1) = ([c˜i(t− 1)]k, c˜i(t− 2)]k, · · · )T ,
[c˜i(t− 1)]k = wHi,k(t− 2)ui,k(t− 2) + ϵi,k(t− 1),
wi,k(t) = wi,k(t− 1) + ki,k(t− 1)ϵi,k(t), (2.20)
where ki,k(t−1) is the gain vector [26] at the receiver and the length of ui,k(t−1) is the
same as wi,k(t− 1). The receiver then quantizes ℜ{ϵi,k(t)} and ℑ{ϵi,k(t)} respectively
with Bc bits, which are then fed back to the transmitter. These fed-back bits are used
by the transmitter to construct ϵˆi,k(t), the estimate of ϵi,k(t). The transmitter then
uses ϵˆi,k(t) to reconstruct the estimate of [ci(t)]k by the RLS principle as follows.
[cˆi(t)]k = wˆ
H
i,k(t− 1)uˆi,k(t− 1) + ϵˆi,k(t), with
uˆi,k(t− 1) = ([cˆi(t− 1)]k, cˆi(t− 2)]k, · · · )T ,
wˆi,k(t) = wˆi,k(t− 1) + kˆi,k(t− 1)ϵˆi,k(t), (2.21)
where kˆi,k(t − 1) is the gain factor at the transmitter and the length of uˆi,k(t − 1) is
the same as wˆHi,k(t− 1).

with proper Ld’s for Lp = 2, 4. We observe that when applying the rotation with proper
angles (see Section 2.4.1), we could obtain much smaller cost function. When the true
ci in Jθ is replaced by the DM-based and/or RLS-based estimates, we also show in
Fig. 2.2 the corresponding cost functions. We observe that the RLS-based quantization
could approach the lower bound.
Fig. 2.3 shows the channel capacity of an MIMO-OFDM system with Nt = 3 and
Nr = 2. The upper bound of channel capacity is given by the water-filling spectrum
power allocation based on the true CRs. We could observe with the proposed feedback
algorithms, the corresponding channel capacities approach the upper bound. The
difference of DM-based and RLS-based quantization in this comparison is quite small.
In Fig. 2.4, we compare the bit-error rate (BER) of GQ, DM-based, RLS-based

transforms the CRs of Nc = 64 subchannels into 10 coefficients, and the resulted
MSEs (at the receiver) are 0.076 and 0.1845 for the Polynomial and B-spline modeling,
respectively. In the quantization process, we use different number of feedback bits (Bc)
to quantize each coefficient, and we assume the feedback channel is perfect. Fig. 2.6
shows the MSEs of the rebuilt CRs at the transmitter. Thought the B-spline model
has larger parametric distortion comparing with the Polynomial model in Fig. 2.10
and Fig. 2.11, we observe in Fig. 2.6 that for lower Bc the B-spline model has smaller
reconstructed MSEs at the transmitter. We can attribute this to the smaller variance
of the coefficients in the B-spline model than in the Polynomial model, as shown in
Table 2.1 and Table 2.2.
Next we consider an MIMO-OFDM BS system [22] with QPSK modulation, and
the transmitter applies beamforming based on the fedback CRs with GQ. We show
the bit-error rate (BER) in Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8. We note that when the number of
feedback bits is less than 4, the B-spline model obtains better performance than the
Polynomial model. Even when the feedback bits are increased, the performance of the
B-spline model is almost the same as the Polynomial model. We also note that for the
B-spline model, the BER is no longer reduced when the number of the feedback bits is
more than 3. This verifies the B-spline can reach good performance with low feedback

Figure 3.1: Two basic user cooperation schemes
idle user node can be served as a relay. In Figure 3.1(b), the two user node both have
data to be transmitted. We can regard it as an extension of Figure 3.1(b). Two user
nodes are not only sources but also relays. We divide the cooperation transmission
into two phases. In the first phase, each user transmits its own data and receives data
of others. In the second phase, the users help each other by relaying the data received
in the first phase.
Here, we take Figure 3.1(a) for our cooperative model. We divide the available
bandwidth into orthogonal channels and allocate these channels to users. We assume
there is no interference between the orthogonal channels. The orthogonality of the
channels can simplify the receiver complexity and the analysis of the cooperative di-
versity system. In this report, we adopt OFDMA systems as the multiple access method
to make the orthogonality between channels.
Now we will focus on the equivalent channel models for the cooperative system.
For direct transmission, we model the channel as
ySD = hSDxs + zSD (3.1)
where hSD is the channel coefficient of the S-D link, and xs is the source transmitted
modulated symbol with average power P , and ySD is received signal at the destination
from the source, and zSD is the zero-mean AWGN at the destination. For cooperative
diversity, we model the channel during the first phase as
ySR = hSRxs + zSR (3.2)

3.3 Cooperative Maximum Ratio Combining
In the conventional diversity combining methods, the maximum ratio combining
(MRC) is optimal since it can maximize the output SNR. In the cooperative diversity
systems, MRC may not be the best choice. When it comes to performance, the symbol-
error-probability (SEP) for general AF links has been reported in [39], where it is also
proved that full diversity is achievable with AF. In S-R links, a weighted superposition
of the source and relay signals received at the destination can be formed using MRC,
which also collects the maximum available diversity order. Unfortunately, with DF
relays, MRC does not offer a full diversity at the receiver.
A low complexity cooperative MRC (C-MRC) has be proposed in [37]. The idea
of the C-MRC is to exploit knowledge of the instantaneous BEP of the S-R links at
the destination, and derive a novel combiner capable to attain full diversity with DF
for any coherent modulation and in any general (possibly multi-branch and multi-hop)
relay links.
We define the instantaneous signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) at links S-R, R-D and S-D
as γSR := |hSR|2γ¯, γRD := |hRD|2γ¯, and γSD := |hSD|2γ¯, respectively, with γ¯ = P/N0
denoting average SNR. In a S-R-D link, errors at the destination occurs when one of
the S-R and R-D transmission is received in error. Hence, for any given modulation
the two-hop S-R-D channel has end-to-end BEP given by
P beq(γSR, γRD) = [1− P bSR(γSR)]P bRD(γRD) + [1− P bRD(γRD)]P bSR(γSR) (3.8)
where P bSR(γSR) and P
b
RD(γRD) are the conditional BEP at both hops which we assume
available at D. We can think of the BEP in (3.8) as the error probability at the receiver
of an equivalent one-hop AWGN link whose output SNR γeq is
γeq :=
1
α
{Q−1[P beq(γSR, γRD)]}2 (3.9)
where Q(x) := (1/
√
2pi)
∫∞
x
exp(−t2/2)dt, and α is a constant which depends on the
underlying constellation. In this report, we use the QPSK modulation, so α is equal
to 4. Upon defining γmin := min(γSR, γSR), it holds that γeq is bounded by [37] :
γmin − 3.24
α
< γeq ≤ γmin. (3.10)

3.4 Introduction to Network Coding
Network coding has recently received much attention form the research community
because of it potential for improving network throughput and robustness.
The basic idea of network coding is to allow coding capability at relaying nodes,
instead of simply forwarding(repeating) the stored data, relay nodes may combine
several input packets, encode them, and forward it to the next node. A typical example
is considered in which the packets form two sources are linearly combined at the relay,
as shown in the figure 3.2.
Node A and node C want to exchange packet via an intermediate node B(wireless
base station). In tradition method, A sends packet a to B(same as C),and then B
broadcasts their packet in different time slot. Different from the traditional method, in
network coding method, B broadcasts a⊕ b in the same slot. A and C still can extract
the information of interest with an easy logic operation. (a = (a⊕c)⊕c, c = (a⊕c)⊕a).
Obviously, the number of transmission is reduced.
3.5 Cooperative Network Coding
In this section, we will consider the combination of cooperative diversity and net-
work coding in wireless network. In [31], the authors have explored the diversity
performance on distributed antenna system from the outage view. In this thesis, we
focus on the diversity performance on the practical combination of the received signals.
24
Figure 3.3: The basic scheme of cooperative network coding
where Re(.) and Im(.) denote the real and imaginary parts of the symbol, respectively,
and sign(·) is the sign of the symbol. The modulated network-coded baseband symbol
can be written as
X2 =
√
Eb((2(s
(I)
1 ⊕ s(I)3 )− 1) + j(2(s(Q)1 ⊕ s(Q)3 )− 1)) (3.19)
=
√
Eb((−x(I)1 × x(I)3 ) + j(−x(Q)1 × x(Q)3 )) (3.20)
We observe that when we uses the BPSK/QPSK modulation, the modulation of s1 ⊕
· · ·⊕sn is equal to (−1)n−1
∏n
i=0 xi, where xi is the modulated data bit of si. We define
⊕p as the physical network coding XOR operator, so we can rewrite (3.19) as
X2 = X1 ⊕p X3 (3.21)
3.5.2 System Model
Our basic uplink cooperative network coding model is shown in Fig. 3.3. For sim-
plicity, there are Ns source nodes, one relay node, and one destination node. Each node
equips with only one antenna. All nodes transmit data on orthogonal sub-channels. In
this report, we adopt an uplink OFDMA system to keep the orthogonality among nodes.
We study the cooperative network coding with decode-and-forward relaying method
since it offers design flexibility for implementing network coding. The OFDMA system
has Ns + 1 users, which is equal to the number of source nodes plus the number of
the relay nodes. In our scheme based on the OFDMA, each sub-carrier is allocated
26
3.6 Decoding Algorithm
3.6.1 Maximum-Likelihood Decision
We introduce the maximum-likelihood (ML) decision method to get the perfor-
mance low bound of the cooperative network coding. Here we assume a perfect inter-
user channel such that the decoding at the relay node has no errors. The ML decision
can be represented as
(X˜1k , · · · , X˜Nsk ) = argmin(
Ns∑
i=1
|Y ik,D −H ik,DXˆ ik|2
+ |Y Rk,D −HRk,D(Xˆ1k ⊕p Xˆ2k ⊕p · · · ⊕p XˆNsk )|2) (3.26)
The simulation result is shown in Figure 3.4, we compare the performance of the original
OFDMA system, multi-source cooperative network coding system, where Ns − Nr
denotes that the system consists of Ns sources and Nr relays. Notice that the 1-1
scheme is equivalent to the conventional cooperative diversity system without coding.
To keep the total transmission power the same as the original OFDMA system, we set
the transmission power of the each node in the cooperative network coding system to
Ns
Ns+Nr
times the transmission power of the original OFDMA system. Here, we assume
there is only a relay node, and we observe that when more sources share the relay,
the transmission power of each node will approach the power of the original OFDMA
system without relay. From Fig. 3.4, we can find that the cooperative network coding
system achieves the full diversity order 2 and is much better than the original OFDMA
system without cooperation. And we can find that even the number of the source
nodes that share the same relay node is increased, the performance does not degrade
too much. It is a wonderful result that we can save a lot of resource compared with
the conventional cooperative systems.
However, the ML detector is very complicated even for perfect inter-user channel,
so we focus on C-MRC in the next section. One ML scheme for BPSK has been
proposed in [34], which, however, induces large computation complexity, especially for
large constellations. In [30], a piece-wise linear (PL) near-ML decoder has also been
derived, which exploits the average bit-error-rate (BER) of the S-R link. But their do
not include networking coding.

for the ith user, and is known to maximize the SNR at the combiner. However since we
use the decode-and-forward relaying strategy, the fading in thelink S-R causes detection
errors at the relay, and the diversity gain cannot be obtained even using MRC. We can
use the cooperative maximum ratio combining (C-MRC) which was proposed in [37]
and can be applied in our cooperative network coding.
3.6.3 C-MRC in Perfect Inter-User Channel
Even in a perfect inter-user channel, we still cannot achieve the diversity gain as
we expect. Recall that the extraction process of the network coded symbol needs the
direct transmission symbol from the sources in the first time slot. Furthermore, we can
find that the extraction will be success only when both the relay transmitted symbol
and the referenced symbol reliable or unreliable at the same time. It is similar to
the S-R-D link of a cooperative system. We can take the two sources and one relay
cooperative network coding system as an equivalent single relay system. So we can
apply the C-MRC method to combine the destination received symbols. By using the
C-MRC, we revise wik,SD = H
i∗
k,D and change w
i
k,RD as
wik,RD =
min(|Hjk,D|2, |HRk,D|2)
|HRk,D|2
HR∗k,D (3.33)
where wik,RD is the weight of R-D link and H
j
k,D is the channel coefficient of the S-D
links expect for ith user, for j = 1, 2, · · · , Ns but j ̸= i. And we substitute (3.33)
into (3.31)-(3.32) to get
x˜
i(I)
k = xˇ
i(I)
k |Re(
min(|Hjk,D|2, |HRk,D|2)
|HRk,D|2

|HRk,D|2
HR∗k,DY
R
k,D)|+ Im(H i∗k,DY ik,D) (3.35)
The simulation result is shown in Figure 3.5. In Fig. 3.5, we can find that although
in the perfect inter-user channel, the conventional MRC cannot achieve the desired
diversity order 2, and it is even worse than the original OFDMA system. With the
C-MRC, the performance can achieve the diversity order 2 as we expect, and the
performance is just a little worse than the ML decision.

LT3: An Overview of IEEE 802.16m Radio Access Technology 
Instructor: Sassan Ahmadi, Intel Corporation, USA 
 
The growing demand for mobile Internet and wireless multimedia applications has motivated 
development of broadband wireless access technologies in the recent years. Mobile WiMAX has 
enabled convergence of mobile and fixed broadband networks through a common wide area radio 
access technology and flexible network architecture. Since January 2007, the IEEE 802.16 
Working Group has been developing a new amendment of the IEEE 802.16 standard (i.e., IEEE 
802.16m) as an advanced air interface to meet and exceed the requirements of ITU-R/IMT 
Advanced for 4G cellular systems. The technology has been submitted as a prominent candidate for 
IMT-Advanced to ITU-R/WP 5D in October 2009. Depending on the available bandwidth and 
multi-antenna configuration, the next generation mobile WiMAX is shown to be capable of 
over-the-air data transfer rates in excess of 1 Gbps and support of a wide range of high-quality and 
high-capacity IP-based services and applications while maintaining full backward compatibility 
with the existing mobile WiMAX systems to preserve investments and continuing support for the 
first generation products. This tutorial describes the major technical features and functionalities of 
IEEE 802.16m and potentials for successful deployment of the next generation of mobile WiMAX 
in 2012. The IEEE 802.16m is designed to provide the state-of-the-art mobile broadband wireless 
access in the next decade and to satisfy the growing demand for advanced wireless multimedia 
applications and services. The standardization of IEEE 802.16m and Release 2.0 of mobile 
WiMAX profiles are expected to complete by 2011.

The developments in communication technologies have yielded many existing and envisioned 
information network architectures such as cognitive radio networks, sensor and actor networks, 
quantum communication networks, terrestrial next generation Internet, and InterPlaNetary Internet. 
However, there exist many common significant challenges to be addressed for the practical 
realization of these current and envisioned networking paradigms such as the increased complexity 
with large scale networks, their dynamic nature, resource constraints, heterogeneous architectures, 
absence or impracticality of centralized control and infrastructure, need for survivability, and 
unattended resolution of potential failures. These challenges have been successfully dealt with by 
Nature, which, as a result of millions of years of evolution, have yielded many biological systems 
and processes with intrinsic appealing characteristics such as adaptivity to varying environmental 
conditions, inherent resiliency to failures and damages, successful and collaborative operation on 
the basis of a limited set of rules and with global intelligence which is larger than superposition of 
individuals, self-organization, survivability, and evolvability. Inspired by these characteristics, 
many researchers are currently engaged in developing innovative design paradigms to address the 
networking challenges of existing and envisioned information systems. In this tutorial, the current 
state-of-the-art in bio-inspired networking is captured. The existing bio-inspired networking and 
communication protocols and algorithms devised by looking at biology as a source of inspiration, 
and by mimicking the laws and dynamics governing these systems is presented along with open 
research issues for the bio-inspired networking. Furthermore, the domain of bio-inspired 
networking is linked to the forthcoming research domain of nanonetworks, which bring a set of 
unique challeges. The objective of this tutorial is to provide better understanding of the potentials 
for bio-inspired and nano-scale networking, and to motivate research community to further explore 
this timely and exciting field.

Cooperative communication has garnered increasing attention in the technical circles because it can 
serve to address a number of the difficulties inherent in wireless channels. The potential advantages 
of cooperation include: achieving multi-antenna gains with single-antenna nodes, coverage 
extension, improved capacity, as well as higher-layer and cross-layer gains. In the past decade, 
many discoveries have been made in both theoretical and practical aspects of cooperative 
communication and the subject continues to see fast-paced advancements. This tutorial presents an 
updated overview of the fundamentals and practical issues involved in cooperative communication. 
Intended to have a broad appeal, the tutorial builds from basic principles. Furthermore, the tutorial

Realizable Forms of Ideal D/C and C/D Conversions
for Complex Bandlimited Periodic Signals

Abstract—For real bandlimited periodic signals, the author of
[2] proposed reconstruction formulas such that the ideal discrete-
to-continuous-time (D/C) conversion can be realized within one
period of the signal. However, for general complex bandlimited
periodic signals, the results of [2] cannot be directly applied
to the real and imaginary parts of the signals. Furthermore, no
corresponding ideal continuous-to-discrete-time (C/D) conversion
has been proposed.
In this paper, we first derive the reconstruction formulas
for complex bandlimited periodic signals, and this leads to a
realizable form of ideal D/C conversion. For the interpolation
pulse of the D/C conversion, we construct its correlation function,
based on which we further propose a matched filter that can
implement the ideal sampling (C/D conversion) of a complex
bandlimited periodic signal. We compare the sampling effect and
noise effect of the proposed C/D conversion with other sampling
approaches. When there are white noises during the sampling,
we also derive the correlation function of the output noise for
the proposed ideal C/D conversion.
I. INTRODUCTION
For bandlimited signals, the sampling theorem [1] provides
an ideal discrete-to-continuous-time (D/C) conversion with
the reconstruction formula composed of infinitely many time-
shifted sinc pulses. In general such ideal D/C conversion
cannot be realized exactly, due to the infinitely long duration
of the sinc pulse. In [2], the author shows that for a real
bandlimited periodic signal, the infinitely many sinc pulses in
the reconstruction formula can be combined into a summation
of finite periodic pulses, and the ideal D/C conversion1 can
be realized within one period of the signal. Similar results are
appeared in [3], while [4] and [5] propose numerical stable
forms of [2]. However, for a general complex bandlimited
periodic signal, we cannot directly apply the results in [2]-
[5] to the real and imaginary parts of the signal. Furthermore,
no corresponding ideal continuous-to-discrete-time (C/D) con-
version, or ideal sampling, has been proposed for bandlimited
periodic signals.
In this paper we propose realizable forms of ideal D/C and
C/D conversions for complex bandlimited periodic signals.
We first derive the reconstruction formulas that are com-
posed of only a finite number of periodic sinc-like complex
interpolation pulses. The resulted ideal D/C conversion is
therefore realizable within one period of the signal. For
real bandlimited periodic signals, the proposed reconstruction
formulas reduce to those in [2] and alternative equivalent
formulas. We further derive the correlation function of the

quantization. Therefore, we use the phrase “D/C conversion” instead of
“digital-to-analogue (D/A) conversion”.
interpolation pulses, based on which we give a matched filter
that can implement the ideal sampling, or C/D conversion,
of a complex bandlimited periodic signal. We compare the
proposed C/D conversion with the ideal impulse sampling
(IIS) and the integrate-and-average sampling (IAS). The IIS
leads to infinitely large output noise variance, while the IAS
cannot attain ideal sampling. The proposed C/D conversion
can attain ideal sampling and maintain finite output noise
variance. We also derive the correlation function of the output
noise for the proposed C/D conversion.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,
we briefly introduce the previous results. The proposed real-
izable ideal D/C and C/D conversions are given in Section III
and Section IV, respectively. Section IV compares the sam-
pling effect and analyze the output noise of C/D conversions.
Finally, Section V concludes this paper.
Notation : We use { } and { } to represent the real and
imaginary parts of a complex number, vector, or function.
The sinc function is defined by sinc(t) = sin(πt)
πt
if t = 0
and sinc(0) = 1. The Fourier transform of sinc(t) is the unit
rectangular function, defined by Π(f) = 1 if |f | ≤ 12 and
Π(f) = 0 for |f | > 12 . We use δ(t) to denote the Dirac delta
function, and δ[n] the Kronecker delta function.
II. PREVIOUS RESULTS
We briefly introduce the ideal D/C conversion for real
bandlimited periodic signals derived in [2]. For a bandlimited
signal x(t), by the sampling theorem [1] one can use its
samples xn = x(nTs), where Ts is the sampling time, to
reconstruct x(t),
x(t) =
∞∑
n=−∞
xn

π(t− nTs)/Ts
=

)
. (1)
Note this implicitly assumes that the spectrum support of x(t)
is (− 12Ts , 12Ts ). In general, we can not exactly implement(1) due to the infinitely many items in the summation and
infinitely long duration of sinc pulses. When x(t) is also a

and there are 2K + 1 choices of Nd and f0 = Nd2T .
Comparing with (2), in (13) we have a factor eiπNd tLTs
that is related to the frequency shift f0 = Nd2T . This does not
imply that we can simply obtain (13) from (2), since in the
derivation we cannot replace Nd2T in (13) with any real f0.
Only with f0 = Nd2T we can reduce the infinitely many terms
in (11) to finite terms in (12). Since there are only finite
items in the summation of (12), and both the periodic pulses
psinc(t) and psincc(t) have finite-duration periods, we obtain
the realizable ideal D/C conversion of x(t) within one period
of x(t) by (12) and (13). We also have the following remarks.
1) The psincn(t) and psinccn(t) in (14) satisfy
psincn(t + 1) = (−1)n−1psincn(t), (16)
psinccn(t + 1) = (−1)npsinccn(t). (17)
2) Based on (16) and (17), for both the pulses in
(13) we can verify that xrec(t) in (12) satisfies
xrec(t + T ) = xrec(t). This coincides with the
periodicity of x(t).
Comparing with the real interpolation pulses in (2), we
now have complex interpolation pulses in (13). This indicates
that the samples {xk} and {xk} are coupled together in
both {xrec(t)} and {xrec(t)}. Therefore, in general the
ideal D/C conversion of a complex signal x(t) cannot be
decoupled into two independent D/C conversions for the real
and imaginary parts of x(t). This further verifies that we
cannot directly apply the reconstruction formula in (2) to the
real and imaginary parts of a general complex signal. For
the sampling rate 1Ts =
M+N+K
T , we can choose Nd within
the range in (15), and if K ≥ 1, there are multiple choices
of Nd in (15) and this leads may lead to several equivalent
reconstruction formulas by (12) and (13).
Using (16) and (17), We can verify that p(t) in (12) is a
periodic pulse with the period T . Hence the period of the
interpolation pulse p(t) is the same as the block duration.
Therefore, in (12) each p(t−kTs), 0 ≤ k < L, is the circular
shift of p(t) within (0, T ).
A. The Waveforms of Pulses
In Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 we show respectively the periodic sinc-
like pulses psincn(t) and psinccn(t) defined in (14) within the
interval (−1, 1) for n = 4, 5. We also show the corresponding
sinc(nt). We observe that the period of psinc4(t) is 2, while
the period of psinc5(t) is 1. These coincide with (16). For
psinccn(t), its period is 1 for n = 4 and 2 for n = 5. These
coincide with (17). The main lobes of sinc(nt), psincn(t),
and psinccn(t) are almost the same and overlapped. On the
other hand, the sidelobes of the sinc(nt) decay gradually to
zero while the sidelobes of psincn(t) and psinccn(t) do not.
B. For Real Signals
For real bandlimited periodic signals, we set N = M + 1
in the proposed reconstruction formulas, and the signal band
is [−MT , MT ]. Let the sampling time be Ts = TL , where L =
N +M +K = 2M +1+K. For the parameter Nd in (13), we
have −K ≤ Nd ≤ K by (15). When we choose Nd = 0, the
proposed reconstruction formulas in (12) and (13) reduce to
(2). If K > 1, we have 2K+1 choices of Nd, which may lead
to several equivalent reconstruction formulas by (12) and (13).
For example, let K = 2, then L = 2M+3 and −2 ≤ Nd ≤ 2.
If we choose Nd = 0, then L + Nd = 2M + 3 is odd. By
(12) with (13), we have the following reconstruction formula
xrec(t) =
L−1∑
k=0
xkpsincL
(
t− kTs
LTs
)
. (18)
While we choose Nd = 1, then L + Nd = 2M + 4 is even.
By (12), we have the following reconstruction formula
xrec(t) =
L−1∑
k=0
xkpsinccL
(
t− kTs
LTs
)
eiπ
(t−kTs)
LTs . (19)
Note since both xrec(t) and xk’s in (19) are real, we can
reduce (19) to
xrec(t) =
L−1∑
k=0
xkpsinccL
(
t− kTs
LTs
)
cos
(

.
(20)
In (18) and (20), we have equivalent reconstruction formulas,
and they lead to the same xrec(t) when xk are samples of a

Fig. 4. The waveforms of x(t) in (21) and the reconstructed signals xa(t)
and xb(t) by (18) and (20), respectively.
Let x(t) be a complex bandlimited periodic signal with the
period T , and
y(t) = x(t) + n(t), 0 ≤ t < T, (28)
where n(t) is the zero-mean additive white Gaussian noise
with two-sided power spectral density N02 . The IIS of y(t) at
t = t0 is
y(t0) = x(t0) + n(t0), 0 ≤ t0 < T. (29)
However, in (29) the noise sample n(t0) has infinitely large
variance theoretically, since the correlation function of n(t)
is Rn(τ)

= E[n(t)n∗(t − τ)] = N02 δ(τ), which leads to
infinitely large Rn(0) = E[|n(t0)|2]. This also verifies that
the ideal impulse sampling is not practical.
On the other hand, the sampling of y(t) at t = t0 by the
IAS involves the integration

in which the signal component 1

x(t)dt is only
an approximation of x(t0). For the noise component
1
Ts

t0− 12Ts
n(t)dt in (30), we can readily verify that its
variance is N02Ts , which increases with the sampling rate

.
Now consider the proposed ideal C/D conversion. With the
input y(t) in (28), the output of the matched filter in (25) is

for 0 ≤ t0 < LTs. The noise component in (31) is
n˜(t0)

=
1
Ts
∫ LTs
0
n(t)p∗L(t− t0)dt, 0 ≤ t0 < LTs, (32)
and by (24) one can show that its variance is N02Ts , which is
the same as the case of the IAS.
Comparing (29), (30), and (31), we see that the proposed
C/D conversion can attain ideal sampling of the signal compo-
nent x(t), while maintaining the same output noise variance
as that of the IAS.
C. Noise Effect
For the noise component in (32), it is clear that the mean
of n˜(t0) is zero for n(t) has zero mean. Since n(t) has
the correlation function Rn(τ) = N02 δ(τ), applying (24) the
correlation function of n˜(t0) is
E{n˜(ta)n˜∗(tb)} = N02Ts

Ts
∫ LTs

p∗L(t− ta)pL(t− tb)dt
=

2Ts
pL(ta − tb), (33)
for 0 ≤ ta, tb < LTs. We also have the following remarks.
1) By (32) and (33), we see that n˜(t) is a zero-mean wide-
sense stationary noise process.
2) By (23) the noise samples n(ta) and n(tb) are inde-
pendent when ta − tb = mTs, where m is a non-zero
integer.
Though we can maintain the independence between two
noise samples with the sampling time Ts = TL for any integer
L ≥ M+N , the variance of each noise sample is N02Ts = LN02T ,
which increases with L and the sampling rate 1Ts .
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we propose ideal D/C and C/D conver-
sions that are realizable theoretically for complex bandlimited
periodic signals. For real signals, the proposed ideal D/C
conversion reduce to that in [2] and other alternative equiva-
lent forms. On the other hand, the proposed C/D conversion
can attain ideal sampling and maintain finite output noise
variance. The correlation function of the output noise is also
derived. With a complex interpolation pulse, in general the
proposed D/C (or C/D) conversion cannot be decomposed into
two independent D/C (or C/D) conversions for the real and
imaginary parts of the signal.
