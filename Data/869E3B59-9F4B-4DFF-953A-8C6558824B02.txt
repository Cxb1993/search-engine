四、結果與討論

圖 1所示TEM照片為未經電漿處理之
Si/PEOX/TaN/Cu/SiCN 及 Cu/SiCN 界面微

有一連續層，推斷此層應為含氧化合物；
銅薄膜經化學機械研磨後表面會迅速形成
氧化層，造成後續鍍覆 SiCN 薄膜時，於
Cu/SiCN 界面存在氧化物。圖 2 及 3 則分

電漿處理可將界面之氧化物去除，並可在
單晶銅之繞射點周圍觀察到金屬矽化物或
金屬氮化物所形成之繞射點。其中經 H2 電
漿處理後，銅表面會與 SiCN 薄膜反應，而
於 Cu/SiCN 界面處形成金屬矽化物 Cu-Si
鍵結。而經 NH3 電漿處理後，銅表面則會

II. Experimental Procedures 
 
A plasma enhanced chemically vapor deposited (PECVD) oxide (PEOX) film of 500 nm 
thick was firstly grown on 300 mm Si wafers as the substrates, and then a PECVD SiCN etch stop 
layer of 50 nm thick with a dielectric constant less than 5 was deposited on the PEOX film. A 
PECVD porous SiOCH extra-low-k film of 340 nm thick with a dielectric constant as low as 2.05 
was subsequently deposited on the SiCN etch stop layer. A top PECVD SiCN etch stop layer of 10 
or 100 nm thick was then deposited onto the porous SiOCH low-k film to obtain a 
Si/PEOX/SiCN/SiOCH/SiCN multilayered film stack structure. A scanning electron microscope 
(SEM, JEOL JSM-6500F) was used to observe the surface morphologies and cross-sectional 
microstructures of the films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, DI 3100) was applied to 
characterize the surface roughness, and a glancing incident angle X-ray diffractometer (GIA-XRD, 
MAC Science MXP18) was used to analyze the crystal structures. The chemical compositions and 
bonding configurations of the film stack with a thin top SiCN layer of 10 nm were analyzed by 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI Quantera SXM/Auger). The multiplex analyses of 
Si2p spectra were performed by bonding spectrum curve fitting with a constant full width half 
maximum of 1.35 eV and a Gaussian to Lorentzian ratio of 20/80. 
A UMIS nanoindenter (Based Model, CSIRO, Australia) with a nanoscratch test module and 
a Berkovich indenter was used to measure the interfacial adhesion strengths between porous 
SiOCH low-k film and SiCN etch stop layers. A series of indentations with varied maximum 
applied loads from 10 to 50 mN were performed. The load was applied to the maximum value, 
hold, and then released in the same duration of 30 seconds respectively. During scratch tests, the 
indenter tip moved forward with the blunt face. The load was ramped from 0 to 30 mN in 30 
seconds, and the scratch length was set as 1500 µm at a moving velocity of 50 µm/sec. An SEM 
and a focus ion beam (FIB, Nova 200) were used to observe the surface morphologies and 
interface delamination of the film stack around the indent marks and scratch tracks after 
nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Basic characterizations and bonding configurations 
The PECVD porous SiOCH extra-low-k film and SiCN etch stop layer exhibited very 
smooth surfaces with a small roughness below 0.5 nm, and both films were verified as an 
amorphous structure. In the porous SiOCH low-k film, roughly spherical pores with a size of only 
a few nanometers were uniformly distributed. By nanoindentation tests, the hardness and elastic 
modulus of the porous SiOCH film were obtained as about 1.7 and 11 GPa, and those of the SiCN 
etch stop layer were 8.0 and 95 GPa, respectively. By using XPS analyses, the top SiCN etch stop 
layer was known to be composed of Si, C and N, and a high content of O was detected on the 
SiCN surface due to surface oxidation. At the SiOCH/SiCN interface, the amount of O drastically 
increased, while N rapidly dropped. The mixing elements constructed an interlayer region with a 
thickness of about 10 nm. Then in the porous SiOCH low-k film, N gradually diminished. 
Figure 1 shows the XPS multiplex analyses and curve fittings of Si2p spectra of SiCN etch 
stop layer and porous low-k SiOCH film. By the XPS depth profiling analyses, the bonding 
configurations from the SiCN layer to porous SiOCH film were realized. As shown in Figure 1 (a), 
the SiCN layer was composed of Si to C and Si to N bonding, including Si-C, Si-C-N and Si-N-C 
bonds, with low binding energy around 101 eV. On the surface of the SiCN layer, a few amount of 
Si-N-O bond of high binding energy up to 103 eV was detected due to surface oxidation. The 
porous SiOCH low-k film was mostly composed of Si to O bonding, including Si-O-C and Si-O2 
bonds, with few remanence of Si to C and Si to N bonding as shown in Figure 1 (b). At the 
SiOCH/SiCN interface, the bonding configurations were more complicated since SiCN related 
radicals penetrated into the porous SiOCH film during deposition. Mixing bonds including Si-C, 
Si-C-N, Si-N-C, Si-N, Si-O3C, Si-O-C, and Si-O2 were detected in the interlayer region. For the 
 4
buckling occurred. As the load was applied to about 23 mN (indentation depth ~ 480 nm), a very 
obvious displacement burst was found in the curves, indicating that a catastrophic fracture of the 
film stack occurred and resulted in a drastic stress release. From the FIB image of the film stack 
after nanoindentation test at a load of 30 mN shown in Figure 3 (c), interface delamination with 
severe leaf-like film chipping off was clearly identified. The cracks was found to propagate along 
the lower SiCN/SiOCH interface, and as the SiOCH/SiCN bi-layer buckled, the cracks then 
transited into the porous SiOCH film and reached the upper SiOCH/SiCN interface. The crack 
path changed into the upper SiOCH/SiCN interface and then penetrated the top SiCN layer, 
resulting in the chipping off of the SiOCH/SiCN bi-layer.

marks after nanoindentation tests at different maximum applied loads of (a) 10, (b) 20, (c) 30 mN. 
 
By using the following equation (1) [11-13], the fracture energy release rates Gc for interface 
delamination, i.e. the adhesion energy per unit area, between porous SiOCH low-k film and SiCN 
etch stop layers can be obtained.

where σrx is the stress acting on the film stack, equal to P/A (P: applied load, A: contact area), and 
νf is the Poisson’s ratio of SiOCH/SiCN bi-layer, approximate to 0.25. The total thickness t and 
average elastic modulus Ef of the SiOCH/SiCN bi-layer were 440 nm and 30 GPa, respectively. 
The crack length of interface delamination a was measured under FIB observations, and the 
contact length of the indenter tip b was determined by the instrument. The interface adhesion 
energy between the porous SiOCH film and SiCN etch stop layers under nanoindentation test with 
a maximum applied load of 30 mN was then calculated as about 1.68 J/m2 as listed in Table 1. 
With higher maximum applied loads of 40 and 50 mN, more materials around the indenter tip 
were expelled even after interface delamination. The crack lengths were inaccurately determined 
as larger, and the interface adhesion energy was thus calculated as lower as about 1.54 and 1.52 
J/m2, respectively.

IV. Conclusions 
 
In this study, the interface bonding configurations and adhesion strength between porous 
SiOCH extra-low-k film and SiCN etch stop layers were investigated. By XPS analyses, the SiCN 
etch stop layer was found to be composed of Si to C and Si to N bonds, and the porous SiOCH 
low-k film was mostly composed of Si to O bonds. Mixing bonds constructed an interlayer region 
at the interface between the SiCN layer and porous SiOCH film. The interface adhesion strength 
between the porous SiOCH film and SiCN etch stop layers was measured by nanoindentation and 
nanoscratch tests. Under the accumulation of sufficient shear stresses around the indented regions, 
interface delamination occurred. By nanoindentation test with an applied load of 30 mN, the 
interface adhesion energy between the porous SiOCH film and SiCN etch stop layers was 
measured as about 1.68 J/m2, and decreased with higher applied loads. The adhesion energy 
obtained by nanoscratch test was lower as about 0.91 J/m2 due to the mode mixity effect.

II. Experimental Procedures 
 
A thermal oxide film (denoted as OX) of 500 nm thick was firstly grown on a 100 mm Si 
wafers as the substrates, and a plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) SiC etch stop layer of 50 nm thick 
was then deposited on the oxide film. A porous SiO2 low-k film (denoted as PSiO2) with a 
thickness of 700 nm was subsequently deposited on the SiC etch stop layer using a sol-gel method 
with a tetraethylorthosilicate-based precursor, followed by spin coating, aging, and thermal curing 
[6]. A plasma treatment of NH3, N2O or O2 was applied onto the surface of the porous SiO2 low-k 
film, and a top SiN capping layer of 30 or 200 nm thick was then deposited by PECVD to obtain a 
Si/OX/SiC/PSiO2/SiCN multilayered film stack structure. The chemical bonding configurations of 
the film stacks with a thin SiN capping layer of 30 nm were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS, Physical Electronics PHI1600). The multiplex analyses of Si2p spectra were 
performed by bonding spectrum curve fitting with a constant full width half maximum of 1.35 eV 
and a Gaussian to Lorentzian ratio of 20/80. 
A UMIS nanoindenter (Based Model, CSIRO, Australia) with a nanoscratch test module and 
a Berkovich diamond indenter was used to measure the interfacial adhesion strengths of 
Si/OX/SiC/PSiO2/SiCN film stacks with a thick SiN capping layer of 200 nm under different 
plasma treatments. During indentation tests, the load was applied to the maximum value, hold, and 
then released in the same duration of 30 seconds respectively. A series of indentations with varied 
maximum loads from 1 to 50 mN were performed. During scratch tests, the load was ramped from 
0 to 50 mN in 30 seconds, and the scratch length was set as 1500 µm at a moving velocity of 50 
µm/sec. An scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) and a focus ion beam (FIB, 
Nova 200) were used to observe the surface morphologies and interface delamination of the film 
stacks around the indent marks and scratch tracks after the nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Bonding configurations and interface chemistry 
By XPS depth-profiling analyses, the variations in bonding configurations (binding states) 
from the surface of top SiN capping layer down to porous SiO2 layer was realized. On the surface 
of the SiN capping layer, some Si-O bonds like Si3O3N2 and Si2O3 of high binding energy up to 
103 eV were detected in addition to Si-N bonds due to surface oxidation. Then at the depth 
between 5 to 25 nm, the constructing bonds of the SiN layer stabilized at the binding energy 
around 100.5 eV, composed of Si-N bonds, including SiN, Si3N2 and Si2N, with few amount of 
Si-Si bond. Afterwards at the depth of about 25 nm approaching to the PSiO2/SiN interface, an 
interlayer region of about 20 nm thick appeared since SiN related radicals penetrated into the 
porous SiO2 film during deposition. Mixing bonds of Si-N and Si-O were both detected in the 
interlayer region. Because the amount of more electronegative O progressively increased with 
depth, the binding energy gradually shifted to a high value of 103.5 eV, revealing the change of 
bonding from Si-N to Si-O. Then the porous SiO2 film was mostly composed of Si to O bonds, 
including SiO2, Si6O9N2, Si3O3N2, and Si2O3, with the incorporation of few amount of N. 
Basically, the bonding configurations in PSiO2/SiN regions after plasma treatments were 
similar to those without treatment except at the PSiO2/SiN interfaces. The bonding configurations 
at the interfaces were more complicated since plasma related radicals penetrated into the porous 
SiO2 films and changed the bonding of the interfaces during plasma treatments. The thicknesses of 
the interlayer regions after plasma treatments were obviously larger than that without treatment. 
Figure 1 shows the XPS multiplex analyses and curve fittings of Si2p spectra at SiO2/SiN interface 
(depth ~ 30 nm). After NH3 plasma treatment, more Si-N bonds of low binding energy existed, 
while in comparison after O2 plasma treatment, the amounts of Si-O bonds of high binding energy 
obviously increased due to the residues of plasma related radicals and the formation of plasma 
related active dangling bonds on the surfaces after plasma bombardments.

νf is the Poisson’s ratios of SiN capping layer and PSiO2/SiN bi-layer, both approximate to 0.25. 
For the analyses of the upper PSiO2/SiN and lower SiC/PSiO2 interfaces, the thicknesses t and 
elastic moduli Ef of the SiN capping layer and PSiO2/SiN bi-layer, were 200 and 900 nm, and 250 
and 87 GPa, respectively. The crack length of interface delamination a was measured under FIB 
observations, and the contact length of the indenter tip b was determined by the instrument. 
Figure 3 shows the adhesion energy of both upper PSiO2/SiN and lower SiC/PSiO2 interfaces 
with different plasma treatments measured by nanoindentation tests. Without plasma treatment, the 
adhesion energy of the PSiO2/SiN and SiC/PSiO2 interfaces were obtained as about 3.7 and 8.3 
J/m2, respectively. After plasma treatments, the adhesion energy of both interfaces increased. From 
aforementioned interface chemistry, it was known that plasma related radicals resided, and active 
dangling bonds formed at the interfaces under plasma treatments. The interface adhesion was 
believed to relate to the chemical bonding configurations, and higher binding energy was expected 
to contribute higher interface adhesion strength. Thus at the O2 plasma treated PSiO2/SiN interface, 
more O-Si bonds of high binding energy especially existed, and the interface adhesion energy was 
improved to 4.7 J/m2. Although plasma treatments were only applied onto the upper PSiO2/SiN 
interfaces, however plasma related radicals were believed to penetrate into the porous SiO2 film 
and changed the chemical bonding of the lower SiC/PSiO2 interface, thus enhancing the adhesion 
energy of the lower interface as well to 10.5 J/m2.

3.3 Interface adhesion measured by nanoscratch test 
Figure 4 shows the surface morphology of Si/OX/SiC/PSiO2/SiN film stack with O2 plasma 
treatment along scratch track after nanoscratch test at a maximum load of 50 mN. From the 
morphology along the scratch track, three fracture stages of the film stack were identified during 
scratch test. At the earliest stage, the SiN capping layer just deformed to a small extent, and only a 
slight scratch trace was observed. When the load was applied to about 0.4 mN (indentation depth ~ 
100 nm and scratch distance ~ 120 µm), the upper PSiO2/SiN interface delaminated, and SiN film 
buckling occurred as observed on the left side of Figure 4. At this scratch distance, obvious 
variations in the load-distance and indentation depth-distance curves of nanoscratch test were 
found. Subsequently with increasing the applied load to 17 mN (indentation depth ~ 450 nm and 
scratch distance ~ 800 µm), more drastic fluctuations of the curves were observed. Comparing 
with the surface morphology of the scratch track at the scratch distance shown on the right side of 
Figure 4, the delamination of the lower SiC/PSiO2 interface was found to begin to occur, and 
PSiO2/SiN bi-layer chipping off was clearly observed.
