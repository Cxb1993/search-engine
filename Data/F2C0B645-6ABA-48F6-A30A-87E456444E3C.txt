English Abstract 
In the 3GPP/EPC standard, the Policy and 
Charging Control (PCC) integrates the QoS 
policy control and charging rule management 
for the data and multimedia services. In this 
project, we design and implement the PCC 
prototype and develop the PCC-based online 
charging data and multimedia services test-bed. 
Then we measure the performance metrics 
based on sophisticated test cases consulted by 
commercial operator. 
The signaling overhead incurred by PCC and 
the online charging management during the 
handover process is essential for the system 
configuration. To address this issue, this 
project investigates the PCC traffic rate and 
analyzes the signaling delay in a handover 
procedure. We develop an analytic model and 
simulation experiments to investigate the 
performance output measures in session 
continuity probability. Our results can provide 
useful guidelines for the mobile operator when 
PCC architecture is realized in their network.

2. Background 
The 3GPP Release 8 standardizes the Evolved 
Packet System (EPS) as a common IP-based 
core network with heterogeneous radio 
accesses.Fig.1 illustrates the network 
architecture for the EPS based on LTE.. In the 
EPS, the IP-based Policy and Charging 
Control (PCC) framework, accommodating the 
Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF; 
Fig. 1(e)), provides PCC rules that are 
4radio environments and QoS profiles. 
Therefore, the charging key, QoS class 
identifier, UL/DL bitrate fields may be 
changed.) 
Steps O.6-O.7. The PDNGW reauthorizes 
online credit (with the updated charging key) 
for the service session by interacting the 
OCS with the  !" ##$ and  !" ##%
messages. 
Step O.8. If the PCC rules reauthorization is 
success, the PDNGW will enforce the 
decision (i.e., the updated QoS class and 
bitrate) to the affected EPS bearer sessions. 
Then it replies the &'()*+",+)-+-"$+.'/0.+
message to the new Serving-GW. 
Steps O.9-O.10. The new Serving-GW sends 
the  12" ##$ message to the PCRF. The 
PCRF replies with the  12" ##% message, 
which includes the new QoS policy rules 
and event triggers. 
Step O.11. After the PCC rules are obtained, 
the new Serving-GW updates its bearer 
context such that the EPS packets can be 
routed correctly. Then new Serving-GW 
sends a #-+)*+",+)-+-"$+.'/0.+ message to 
the new MME. The new MME updates the 
UE location with the Home Subscriber 
Server (HSS). 
Step O.12. The new MME sends a 3%&"%22+'*"
message to the UE. 
Step O.13. The UE acknowledges the received 
message by replying a 3%&" #/4'5+*+
message to the MME. 
For an intra-Serving-GW handover procedure, 
only Steps O.1, O.12 and O.13 are executed 
(i.e., Steps 1-3 in Fig. 2 (a)), and the details are 
omitted. 
3. The Proposed Proactive Scheme 
This section proposes the proactive scheme 
aimed at reducing PCC reauthorization 
signaling delay in the inter-Serving-GW 
handover. In particular, our scheme predicts 
the occurrence of the inter-Serving-GW 
handover to shorten the core network signaling 
delay for the handover procedure by 
performing the related operations in the 
inter-Serving-GW handover in advance. 
In the intra-Serving-GW handover, the EPS 
session routing path is not changed, and only 
three signaling messages are exchanged to 
update the MME record as illustrated in Fig. 
2(a). The idea of the proactive scheme is to 
track the user mobility by maintaining a list of 
neighboring SAs of the UE. The PDNGW can 
proactively retrieve the updated PCC 
information for the neighboring Serving-GWs 
of these SAs in advance. Once the UE moves 
to a neighboring Serving-GW, the possible 
ways to avoid some of the signaling message 
exchanges for the PCC rule reauthorization are 
listed below: 
 The PDNGW need not perform Steps 
O.4-O.5 because the updated PCC rule 
information has already been stored in the 
PCC rule record. 
 If the “charging key” is unchanged in the 
updated PCC information, the PDNGW 
does not perform Steps O.6 and O.7. 
 The PDNGW can piggyback the updated 
PCC rule information to the new 
Serving-GW in the Update Bearer 
Response message in Step O.8. 
 The Serving-GW need not perform Steps 
O.9 and O.10 because the updated PCC 
rule information is informed by the 
PDNGW in the Update Bearer Response 
message. 
The proactive scheme consists of three phases: 
Phase 1: User Mobility Tracking 
When a user starts an EPS session, the serving 
MME maintains a user mobility state 
3%63!'+78/90()-!:0/0;8/90()-! to record 
which TA type a user currently resides in. 
When 3%63!'+78/90()-!, the serving MME 
informs the Serving-GW of the neighboring 
SA list of the user. With the 3%63!'+
information, one can efficiently monitor the 
user movement and inform the PDNGW for 
updated PCC information for the neighboring 
Serving-GW in advance.  
Phase 2: PCC Pre-reauthorization 
6therefore, Pc is a decreasing function of the 
mobility factor. This figure shows that the 
proactive scheme outperforms the original 
scheme in all cases. Specifically, when the 
mobility factor E[ts]/E[ta]<1, the continuity 
performance is higher than 99.5%. When the 
mobility factor E[ts]/E[ta]>10, we observe that 
the continuity performance for the original 
scheme rapidly drops and is significantly 
affected by the boundary TA proportion β.  
Fig. 4: Effects of the user mobility factor.
Fig. 5: Effects of the signaling delay threshold
Effects on the signaling delay threshold Tthre. 
Fig. 5 plots Pc against Tthre. An interesting 
observation is that Pc =99.999% when Tthre
>6E[td] and Tthre>4E[td] in the original scheme 
and the proactive scheme, respectively. It 
means that the proactive scheme is more able 
to support real-time application under the 
customer's carrier-grade quality expectations in 
session continuity. We note that only non-real 
time services (i.e., background and interactive 
data) will accept a large delay threshold.

Abstract—In this paper, we present the design and the imple-
mentation of a test-bed for the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
system proposed in 3GPP TS23.203. Specifically, we use an IP
multimedia call service example to demonstrate how to implement
an advanced mobile service with policy and charging control
in our test-bed. We show that the PCC system can handle the
application-level session information and the network-level bearer
information dynamically. The corresponding performance metrics
(e.g., the signaling delays) can be obtained through our test-bed,
which can be considered as one of our major contributions in
this work.

I. INTRODUCTION
The convergence of wireless radio networks with all-IP
architecture has gained significant attention due to advances in
Radio Access Technology (RAT) and the prevalence of wireless
IP multimedia applications. The previous studies [5], [7], [8]
provide efficient online charging solutions for the all-IP core
network. In this paper, we further investigate the relationship
between the network resources control (with QoS guarantee)
and flexible charing/tariff scheme.
In 3GPP Release 8, the Evolution Packet Core (EPC)
is standardized such that operators can deploy and operate
one common IP-based core network for heterogeneous radio
accesses types, including Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE-
advanced, 2G/3G, and other non-3GPP radio accesses. In the
EPC, the Policy and Charging Control (PCC) architecture is
defined to realize dynamic network resource control and charg-
ing management over heterogeneous networks [1], [2], [10].
The advanced mobile services can be designed and supported
through the PCC architecture, which brings operators extra
revenue and increases the user satisfaction.
In this paper, we design and implement a PCC test-bed to
investigate the usage and impacts on advanced mobile service
deployment. In this experimental test-bed, we provide web-
based user interface for the subscribers to set up their service
admission policy (e.g., online charging budget) conveniently,
and the setup can be transformed to PCC rules and delivered to
the PCC system immediately. In other words, we offer a testing

PDNGW/PCEF through the Gx interface (see Chapter 9 in
[5]).
When a User Equipment (UE; Fig. 1 (c)) initiates a new on-
line service session, the PDNGW requests a PCC rule from the
PCRF, which includes the details about the end-to-end services
that need to be transferred, such as the service session filters
(source/destination IP address and port number), the related
QoS description (QoS class, maximum and guaranteed bitrate
for uplink/downlink traffic), and the charging information (the
measurement method and the charging key).
Based on the provision PCC rule, the PDNGW generates
an aggregate for each traffic class that is mapped to the
its combined QoS description. The LTE Evolved Universal
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) receives the
aggregate QoS descriptions for each bearer service session.
The E-UTRAN then uses it for downlink scheduling and
uplink policing, while the PDNGW uses it for downlink/uplink
traffic control. In the next section, we propose a PCC test-
bed to investigate the usage and impacts on advanced mobile
service deployment. In this experimental test-bed, the user can
configure the service admission policy and online charging
limit dynamically.
III. DESIGN OF THE PCC TEST-BED
In our implementation, we use the IP Multimedia Subsystem
(IMS) call control service as an example to illustrate the ca-
pabilities provided by the PCC test-bed. In a service scenario,
the administrator and/or the subscriber can configure the PCC
rules through a Web-based portal offered by the operator. The
access control is handled based on the configured credit budget
limit, the access call list and the bandwidth allocation described
in the PCC rules. Through appropriate settings, the intelligent
control services can be easily designed and be realized.
A. The Functional Blocks of the PCC Test-Bed
Fig. 2 shows the block diagram of our PCC test-bed,
where each of the PCC entity consists of several functional
modules. The PCRF (Fig. 2 (a)) includes the Diameter Mod-
ule, the PCC Rules Handler and the SQL Module. In the
PCRF, the Diameter Module implements the Gx and Rx
interfaces. This module communicates with the IMS Call
Session Control Function (CSCF) (Fig. 2 (b)) for service
session request by the Rx Authorize Authenticate
Request/Answer (AAR/AAA) messages and communi-
cates with the PDNGW (Fig. 2 (c)) for providing the PCC
rules by the Gx CCR/CCA messages. The PCC Rules Handler
collects the subscriber (i.e., UE; Fig. 2 (e)) information of the
service session for generating the PCC rules. The subscriber
information is retrieved from the the SPR (Fig. 2 (d)).
The CSCF (including the IMS Session Handler and the
Diameter Module) is responsible for the IMS signaling con-
trol and the service information provision. The IMS Session
Handler handles the service session setup by routing the SIP
messages from/to the UE; the Diameter Module is responsible
for the diameter message communication with the PCRF.
The PDNGW (Fig. 2 (c)) includes four modules: the Policy
Enforcement Module, the Diameter Module, the Charging

Fig. 3. The Sequence Diagram for the IMS Call Control Service in PCC
Rules Handler and the IP Filter Handler. The Policy En-
forcement Module is responsible for the PCC rules execution.
These PCC rules are retrieved from the PCRF by exchanging
Diameter messages via the Diameter Module. The Charging
Rule Handler obtains the credits from the OCS (Fig. 2 (h)) by
exchanging Gy CCR/CCA messages via the Diameter Module.
Based on the PCC rules, the IP Filter Handler uses the iptables
[9] for IP traffic control, e.g., set the budget limit.
The SPR (Fig. 2 (d)) is a database that stores the subscrip-
tion profiles and the related charging information. The sub-
scription profile (i.e., the user policy rules) can be dynamically
configured by the Web Server (Fig. 2 (g)) . The Web Server
contains the SQL Module and the Web Interface: The SQL
Module is responsible for connecting to the SPR to access the
subscription profile; the Web Interface provides a user interface
for configuring the policy rules.
Note that in the Diameter Modules in PCRF,
CSCF and PDNGW, we implement C++ classes,
i.e., the AAA CreditControlClient and the
AAA CreditControlServer. These classes are sub-
inherited from the AAA ClientAuthSession and
AAA ServerAuthSession classes in the Open Diameter API
[6] that realizes the diameter protocol [3], [4]. More details
can be found in Appendix A.
B. The Message Sequence of the PCC Test-Bed
When the policy rules are configured in the SPR, a new
call session is handled based on the policy settings. The

• The iptables package is used to exercise the IP Filter
Handler for limiting the IP traffic in the PDNGW.
• The SPR is implemented by Mysql version 5.0.45 for
storing subscription profile.
• The Web Server is implemented by Apache 2.2.9 and the
PHP 5.2.6 packages for handling the web portal.
• The CSCF, the PCRF and the PDNGW contain the Di-
ameter Modules that are implemented by OpenDiameter
1.0.7h.
Based on the above test-bed, we perform 1000 IMS calls
setup with PCC control. Figs. 4-5 show the PCRF executing
snapshots for the Diameter CCR and CCA messages. Fig. 6
shows the types of Diameter messages captured during an IMS
call setup. We also measure the message processing delay (i.e.,
T1 - T7) marked in Fig. 3. The experimental data is shown in
Fig. 7. We note that the message delay T7 is around 276ms.
This period records the latency started from the first PCC
signaling message AAR in Step 3 to the last PCC signaling
message CCA in Step 15. Our experiment data indicates a large
latency for PCC signaling in an IMS call setup.
V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the design and the implementa-
tion of a test-bed for the Policy and Charging Control (PCC)
system proposed in 3GPP TS23.203. The advanced mobile

Fig. 7. The Message Data Signaling Delay Measured in Our Test-bed
services can be designed and supported through the PCC archi-
tecture, which brings operators extra revenue and increases the
user interaction. Specifically, we used an IP multimedia call
service example to demonstrate how to implement an advanced
mobile service with policy and charging control in our test-bed.
We also provided the signaling delay measurement in this test-
bed. Finally, we observed that the PCC core network delay is
unnegligible in an IMS call setup. Therefore, further works
should be conducted to reduce signaling delay in the PCC
system.
APPENDIX
In the Diameter Modules, we modified the Open Diameter
API [6] for diameter messages. Open Diameter API is a session
based API which realizes the diameter protocol defined in
RFC3588 [3]. In this API, a diameter session is represented
by a C++ class. Generally, the session classes are categorized
into either client or server, which provide AAA client and AAA
server capabilities, respectively. These two types of classes are
further sub-divided into authentication/authorization session
classes and accounting session classes. All of these session
classes are derived from a specific AAA state machine as
defined in Sec 8 of [3].
In Open Diameter framework, client application should
create instance of the client session class, for example,
AAA ClientAuthSession (Fig. 8 (1)), which represents the
