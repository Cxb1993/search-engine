the diffracted images entering at different an-
gles oblique to the pupil. This discovery forms
the foundation analytical methods to analyze
optics resolving power. Later, in 1951, the
Hopkin’s equations, derived by Professor H. H
Hopkins, clarified the correlation relationship
in the image from both spatial and frequency
domain.
Albeit the difference between Abbe’s and
Hopkin’s method, these two methods are ba-
sically very similar. Abbe’s method directly
discretize the source into independent coher-
ence sources while Hopkin’s method use SVD
to decompose the imaging results into indepen-
dent equivalent de-correlated light sources.
Given a 1cmx1cm Integrated Circuit with
1nm as the resolution, we need 1014 image
pixels to computate. A straightforward im-
plementation of the classical optical theorems
can not fulfill this task. As a result, many
new efficient micro-lithography optical image
simulators have been developed. To the au-
thor’s knowledge, most of the related high-
speed commercial tools are developed based
on the Hopkin’s theory with singular value
decomposition (SVD) method since SVD can
produce more compact kernels than the tra-
ditional Abbe’s method. However, it takes a
long time for Hopkin’s method to perform SVD
on the brute force image enumerations to ex-
tract independent kernels sorted by the singu-
lar values. Therefore it is crucial to develop a
method which has Abbe’s simplicity and effi-
ciency while generating as compact kernels as
the Hopkin’s method.
In this paper, we claimed that by comb-
ing Abbe’s theory with the Principle Compo-
nent Analysis (PCA) method, which is specific
to the covariance eigen-decomposition method
rather than the SVD (Singular Value Decom-
position) method, we can achieve an extremely
efficient computational algorithm to generate
the essential kernels for aerial image simula-
tion. The major reason for this speed up is
from our discovery that the covariance matrix
of Abbe’s kernels, which is in the dimension of
number of discretized condenser sources, can
be easily constructed analytically as well as de-
composed to a basis set. As a result, an analyt-
ical form of compact decorrelated Abbe’s ker-
nels can be obtained even without explicit for-
mation of the kernel images. Furthermore, the
asymptotic eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
covariance matrix can also be obtained with-
out much computational effort. This discovery
also creates a new way to analyze the relation-
ship between sources and final images which
can be easily utilized to optimize source shape
for lithography process development. Several
imaging phenomenon have been readily ex-
plained by this method. This method can also
be incorporated with 3D mask analysis. Ex-
tensive experimental results demonstrate the
efficiency and accuracy of this method, Abbe-
PCA.
The organization of the rest of this paper
is as follows: Imaging equation of partial co-
herent illumination by Abbe’s method will be
introduced in the first section. Compact kernel
generation by decomposition will be explained
in sections 2 and 3. Simulation results and
comparisons will be shown in Section 4, and
finally we will conclude our paper in Section 5.
2 Background
In optical lithography systems, object plane,
i.e. the mask patterns, is generally illuminated
by partially coherent quasi-monochromatic
light. The light originates from an incoher-
ent source and reaches the object plane. The
mask patterns can be regarded as inputs to
the imaging system, and the illumination sys-
tem as the response mapping from the ob-
ject plane to the image plane. Abbe’s method
(also called source points integration approach)
models imaging with such illuminators[8]. This
approach is based on a spatial discretization
of the source into discrete point sources as il-
lustrated in Fig.(2). These point sources are
mutually incoherent due to the thermal nature
of the light source. The statistical indepen-

cretization in Abbe’s method.
3.1 The Abbe’s Method
Imaging system regards the light intensity
I(x, y, z) as the output and the mask function
O(x, y) as the input passing through the trans-
fer function K. So we may rewrite the imaging
equation (2) as
I(x, y, z) =
Z ∞
−∞
Z
J(f, g)Icon(x, y; z)dfdg, (5)
where
Icon(x, y; z) = |H(x, y)e−i2pi[(f ′−f ′′)x+(g′−g′′)y] ∗ O(x, y)|2.
(6)
The Abbe’s method first approximates the
effective source function J by a finite number
of point sources:
J(f, g) ∼= J4(f, g) =
∑
s
asδ(f − fs, g − gs)
(7)
Where as is the effective strength of the dis-
cretized point source located at δ(f−fs, g−gs).
The aerial image is then obtained by an in-
coherent superposition of all the contributions
and becomes
I(x, y, z) ∼=
∑
s
asIcon(fs, gs; z). (8)
The computation procedure for the Abbe’s
method is given as below:
1. Calculate the object spectrum O(f, g) from
O(x, y).
2. Approximtate the effective source J(f, g) by
the discretized source J4(f, g)[see Eq.(7)].
3. For each discrete source point, compute the
component image according to Eq.(6).
4. Sum component images to obtain total in-
tensity[see Eq.(8)].
For an effective source of area As, and an
object of area Am, the computation time scales
according to
tcompute ∝ As ·Am. (9)
4 The Hopkin’s Method
On the whole, partially coherent imaging can
be formulated by Hopkins’ formula
I(x, y) =
Z Z Z Z
J−0 (x2 − x1, y2 − y1)H(x− x1, y − y1)
H?(x− x2, y − y2) ∗O(x1, y1)O?(x2, y2)dx1dy1dx2dy2
(10)
where J0 is a coupled term which makes worse
the computational complexity. Previous re-
searchers proposed to rewrite this complicated
equation to a summation of coherence forma-
tion, which would then use several convolution
kernels to approximate.
Method most frequently used is to apply
singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the 4D
matrix built by J−0 HH
?, which can be ob-
tained in both frequency domain and spatial
domain. As you can imagine, this 4D matrix

is so huge that applying SVD on it needs ex-
tremely large memory space and also spends a
lot of time for eigenvalue decomposition. Dur-
ing the process development and model fitting,
kernels are required to regenerate frequently
when parameters are changed, like NA, σ, de-
focus, ... etc. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to apply fast eigenvalue decomposition
with high resolution.

represents a different repetition of the experi-
ment, and each column gives the results from
a particular probe, the PCA transformation is
given by:
Y =XV = US
, where USV T is the singular value decompo-
sition (SVD) of X. Observing the above equa-
tion, it is crucial to find the V matrix to get
Y . According to the definition of X, we know
that
XTX =(USV T )T ∗ (USV T )
=V STUTUSV T = V STSV T
Therefore, V is the eigenvector of the correla-
tion matrix C(= XTX) of X. That is
C =XTX = V ΣV T
, where Σ is the eigenvalue matrix of C which
is also the square of singular value matrix (i,e,
Σ = STS).
5.2 Abbe-PCA Algorithm Details
According to the Abbe-SVD derivation, we
know that I = [Object ∗ US]2. Also from the
above PCA analysis, we get XV = US. Thus,
it is clear that
I =[Object ∗ US]2
=[Object ∗XV ]2 (15)
, where X = Hˆ. The correlation matrix C of
X can be written as follows:
C =XHX (16)
=(Pupil · FBasis · √a)H(Pupil · FBasis · √a)
=
√
a
H
FBasisT · PupilH · Pupil · FBasis · √a
Let P 2 = PupilH · Pupil, we can get
Ci=(x1,y1),j=(x2,y2) = Fbasisx2−x1,y2−y1 ∗ P 2 =
Fbasisδx,δy ∗P 2 = Fourierδx,δy(P 2). It is clear
that each entry of C can be easily obtained by
looking up the relative position in the matrix
of the 2D fourier transform of the square of the
Pupil function.
If we use a simple cycle aperture
with NA, then the pupil function is
P (x, y) = jinc(2rNA/λ). Therefore
P 2 = jinc2(2rNA/λ). We also know
that the fourier transformation of the square
of jinc function is the chinese hat function
chat(r) = 0.5(cos−1(r) − r√(1 − r2))rect0.5r.
Therefore, the correlation matrix can be easily
obtained analytically.
5.2.1 Efficient Eigen-Decomposition of
the Analytical Correlation Ma-
trix
After obtained the correlation matrix, the rest
of the job is simply eigen-decomposed it. If
we descretize the source intomxm independent
sources, then the matrix size is m2xm2 which
is still a relative big matrix. Note that the
Hopkin’s method require to perform SVD on
n2xn2 matrix, where n is the pixel dimension.
It is already a huge saving.
In case further speed up is needed, the fol-
lowing property can be explored. First, if we
discretize the source into mxm squares as a
regular mesh, then the correlation matrix is
a Block-Toeplitz-Toeplitz-Block (BTTB) ma-
trix. The eigenvalue and eigenvectors are
approaching to the fourier transformation of
the first row of the BTTB matrix and the
eigenvectors are approaching to the fourier ba-
sis according to the Block-Circulant-Circulant-
Block theory. Therefore, the computation time
for eigenvalues are only around the FFT time
for a mxm block which is around m2logm.
The speed up is significant. As when we use
concentric angle discretization for the circular
source, each block of the correlation matrix is
indeed circulant matrix. The eigen-value are
exactly fourier transform of the first rows. Tak-
ing advantage of the block structure, we can
decompose one eigen-decomposition operation
on a big m2xm2 matrix problem into m eigen-
decomposition operation mxm matrix. The
speed up is also clear.

7 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed to generate compact
Abbe’s kernel for aerial image simulation using
PCA method. Reduced kernel numbers and
compact kernel size, advanced segmented con-
centric circles discretization, fast imaging sim-
ulation time, and memory saving are the main
advantages. Also, we can still use the analyt-
ical approach to build the correlation matrix
and perform eigen-decomposition efficiently by
taking advantage of the matrix sturcture. Over
40X speed up is observed when compare with
the state-of-the-art algorithm Abbe-SVD.
