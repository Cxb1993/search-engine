from a failure.  Faults such as these are 
called to be (not covered), and the probability 
of successful recovery on the failure of an 
primary component (or standby component) 
is denoted by C. Quantity C which including 
the probabilities of successful detection, 
location, and recovery from a failure is 
knows as the (coverage factor) or (coverage 
probability) (see Trivedi [13]). A standby 
component is called a 'warm standby' if its 
failure rate is nonzero and is less than the 
failure rate of an primary component. We 
assume that the coverage factor is the same 
for primary and standby component failures 
and is denoted by C. We continue with the 
assumption that primary component failure 
(or standby component failure) in the (unsafe 
failure) state is cleared by a reboot. Reboot 
delay takes place for a primary component 
(or standby component) which is 
exponentially distributed.  
 
For the sake of discussion, we consider the 
requirements of a 30 MW power plant.  We 
assume that generators are available in units 
of 30 MW, 15 MW and 10 MW. We consider 
three availability models as follows: The first 
model consists of one 30 MW active unit and 
one 30 MW warm standby unit. The second 
model includes two 15 MW active unit and 
one 15 MW warm standby unit. The third 
model is composed of three 10 MW active 
unit and two 10 MW warm standby unit.  
 
三、研究目的 
 
The purpose of this project is threefold: (i) 
we present a recursive method, using the 
supplementary variable technique, treating 
the supplementary variable as the remaining 
repair time, to develop the steady-state 
availability for availability model i, where i = 
1, 2, 3; (ii) for each availability model,  the 
explicit expressions for the steady-state 
availability for three various repair time 
distributions such as exponential, K-stage 
Erlang, and deterministic are derived; (iii) 
based on three repair time distributions,  
coverage factor, reboot delay, the values of 
the system parameters and the cost of the 
primary and standby components, we rank 
three availability models. 
四、文獻探討 
 
The supplementary variable technique was 
first proposed by Cox [3], and it had been 
widely applied to the M/G/1 queueing system 
by Hokstad [8], Takacs [9] and many others.  
Using the supplementary variable technique, 
Gupta and Rao [6, 7] studied the no-spare 
M/G/1 machine repair problem and the 
cold-standby M/G/1 machine repair problem, 
respectively.  The important effects of some 
critical single faults that cause a system 
failure in a replicated non-repairable system 
are considered in Bouricius et al. [2]. The 
concept of coverage and its effect on the 
reliability and/or availability model of a 
repairable system has been introduced by 
several authors such as Arnold [1], Dugan [4], 
Trivedi [10], and etc. Gaikowsky, et al. [5] 
and Wang and Pearn [13] analyzed the series 
systems with cold standby components and 
warm standby components, respectively, 
where the repair time distribution of the 
server is assumed to be exponentially 
distributed.  Wang and Kuo [11] considered 
the reliability, the availability, and the 
cost/benefit analysis of four different series 
system configurations with mixed standby 
(include cold standby and warm standby) 
components. Recently, Wang et al. [12] 
extended Wang and Pearn's [13] paper to 
investigate the cost benefit analysis of series 
systems with warm standby components and 
general repair times. The problem considered 
in this paper is more general than the works 
of Wang et al. [12] and Trivedi [10].   
 
五、研究方法 
 
We provide a recursive method, using the 
supplementary variable technique and 
treating the supplementary variable as the 
remaining repair time, to develop the 
steady-state availability, for three availability 
models. For each availability model, the 
explicit expressions for steady-state 
availability for three various repair time 
distributions, such as exponential, K-stage 
Erlang, and deterministic are provided. We 
analyze the following three comparisons: 
(i) The effects of the distribution parameters  
on the steady-state availability of three
