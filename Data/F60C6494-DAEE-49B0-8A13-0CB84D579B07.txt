broad mesomorphic peak in the WAXS profile below 190 
deg C； intensity of this mesophase peak started to 
decrease at 150 deg C, with concomitant emergence of 
WAXS- or DSC-discernible formation of stereocomplex 
(βc) crystals. Isothermal measurements at 200 vs. 
170 deg C revealed the presence of low vs. high 
populations of helical pairs； βc crystals were 
observed to develop only at 170 deg C but not at 200 
deg C, indicating the need for adequate population of 
racemic helical pairs for formation of their 
mesomorphic clusters in the melt matrix as precursors 
of βc nuclei. The clear change in the melt structure 
well before the formation of incipient βc crystals 
reflects strong driving force under large 
supercooling toward transformation, but the 
transformation process is kinetically suppressed: 
only after extensive development of racemic helices 
and emergence of mesomorphic clusters in the melt 
matrix may nucleation occur. These observations 
suggest that the nucleation process proceeds in 
elementary units of preformed helical pairs in the 
melt matrix, with an intermediate stage of clustered 
helical pairs before incipience of βc crystals.

pairs into a crystalline lattice of higher melting temperature (Tm) than that of the parent 
homopolymer crystals. 
It was first reported8 in 1987 that racemic stereocomplex of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and 
poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) may crystallize specifically into the βc form with Tm strongly increased to 
ca. 210 °C as compared to the case of Tm ≈ 160 °C for the α crystalline form of enantiomeric 
components. Okihara et al.7 proposed that the βc form is triclinic in structure (space group P1), with 
two chains per unit cell of parameters a = b = 0.916 nm, c = 0.870 nm, α = β =109.2° and γ =109.8°. 
Based on powder patterns from wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and results from molecular 
mechanics computations on the stereocomplex crystal, Brizzolara et al.9 refined the triclinic unit 
cell parameters as a = 0.912 nm, b =0.913 nm, c = 0.930 nm, α = β = 110° and γ = 109°. Cartier et 
al.10 subsequently proposed a large trigonal cell that includes six chains per unit cell with a = b = 
1.498 nm, c = 0.870 nm, α = β = 90° and γ =120° (space group R3c) in order to explain the 
triangular shape of single crystals of the PLLA/PDLA stereocomplex in terms of frustrated packing 
of paired 31-helical chains of opposite handedness. Ozaki et al.11 and Sarasua et al.12 studied the 
interaction of stereocomplex chains of polylactides during crystallization by means of Fourier- 
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), revealing a shift of the C=O stretching band in βc crystals 
to a lower wavenumber lower than the corresponding band in α crystals of the chiral counterpart. 
This band shift is accompanied by similar displacements in the C–H spectral bands. These results 
were interpreted in term of specific C–H•••O=C interactions between the paired stereoisomeric 
chains. More detailed assignments of conformation- or interaction-sensitive bands of polylactides 
were further made for both the chiral PLLA and the racemic PLLA/PDLA blend.13-18   
Although structural features of the βc crystalline form have been extensively studied and 
specific interactions for stereocomplexation between PLLA and PDLA have been addressed, the 
process of the stereocomplex formation was not thoroughly examined. Whether PLLA/PDLA 
stereocomplexation occurs in solution or melt states prior to the formation of βc crystals or during 
crystallization where PLLA (32) and PDLA (31) helices develop through crystallographic clipping

in-house Rigaku Ultima IV instrument equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source (with wavelength λ 
= 1.542 Å) operating at 40 kV and 20 mA and an INSTEC HCS302 high-temperature stage. DSC 
measurements for samples ca. 5 mg in weight were made by use of a Perkin-Elmer Diamond 
instrument routinely calibrated with high purity indium and zinc standards and operated under a 
steady stream of protective nitrogen. In both WAXS and DSC studies, the same temperature 
programs as those in the FTIR studies were adopted for temperature- or time-resolved 
measurements. 
 
Results 
Formation of Paired Helices in Melt. Given in Figure 1a-c are the temperature-resolved 
FTIR spectra of the racemic blend in respective ranges of 3100-2800, 1790-1720, and 1320-800 
cm−1 upon cooling from 270 °C at 1 °C/min. It may be observed from Figure 1a that methyl C-H 
stretching (asymmetric vs. symmetric, ca. 2990 vs. 2940 cm-1) and methine Cα−H stretching band 
(2880 cm-1) all shift slightly to lower frequencies with decreasing temperature; concomitantly, 
intensity of CH3 asymmetry stretching band increased whereas intensities of CH3 symmetric 
stretching/Cα−H stretching bands decreased. These are more clearly demonstrated by corresponding 
difference spectra given in Supporting Information (SI) as Figure S1. The broad C=O stretching 
band around 1750 cm−1 (cf. Figure 1b) suggests a distribution of local surroundings for carbonyl 
groups. With decreasing temperature, there was a general narrowing of the C=O stretching band 
(signifying preference toward a specific molecular environment) with delicate shifts (as more 
clearly identifiable from the second-derivative curves in Figure S2) of maximum position toward 
lower wavenumbers. These observations suggest the development of weak interchain CH•••O=C 
hydrogen bonding.11, 12 Changes in peak positions of CH3 asymmetry stretching and C=O stretching 
bands with temperature are given in Figure 2a, where significant changes in peak positions occur 
between 220 and 160 °C, beyond which the changes are more modest.  
Corresponding WAXS profiles shown in Figure 2b provide some clues to the molecular 
6 
 
As shown in Figure 4a, carefully deconvoluted WAXS profiles provide direct evidences for 
the existence of such a mesomorphic phase of intermediate order. The WAXS profile at 270 °C can 
be decomposed into two broad amorphous peaks which in combination give close description of the 
amorphous halo centered at scattering vector q (≡ 4πλ−1sinθB) ≈ 1.1 Å−1. For temperatures below 
180 °C (the case of 173 °C is selected for demonstration), a new (i.e., “mesomorphic”) component 
must be incorporated to provide proper description of the halo as continued from higher 
temperatures. For temperatures below 150 °C (with the case of 137 °C selected for demonstration), 
crystalline peaks representing (110), (300)/(030) and (220) reflections are further added. The fitted 
compositions (in terms of fractions of the corresponding peak areas) of amorphous, mesomorphic, 
and crystalline phases are summarized in Figure 4b. The amorphous fraction (fa) started to decrease 
at 180 °C, with the mesomorphic fraction (fm) increasing up to ca. 0.38 at 150 °C. Upon quick 
emergence of βc crystals below 150 °C, fa continues to decrease albeit at a lower rate whereas fm 
also starts to decrease; both remain significant (fa ≈ 0.46 and fm ≈ 0.20) at 105 °C where the 
crystallization process was completed (cf. DSC trace in Figure 3b), leaving a crystalline fraction fc ≈ 
0.34. This means that nearly half of the pre-existing mesomorphic phase has eventually transformed 
into βc crystals whereas the rest half remains mesomorphic; nearly half of the final crystallinity is 
contributed by pre-existing mesomorphic phase whereas the remaining half is contributed by 
conversion from the amorphous phase.   
In view of the already extensive formation of paired helices at 180 °C (cf. Figure 3a), the 
mesomorphic state is most likely related to clusters of helical pairs, which would be expected to 
serve subsequently as candidates for primary nucleation of βc crystals. Figure 5a compares the 
time-resolved developments of paired helices in supercooled melt at 170 and 200 °C whereas 
Figures 5b and 6 show respectively the corresponding DSC traces and WAXS profiles. It may be 
observed that isothermal crystallization is well facilitated after a 4-min period of incubation at 170 
°C with significant development of paired helices. At a much lower population of paired helices, 
isothermal crystallization at 200 °C remains inactivated even after prolonged incubation exceeding 
8 
 
population of helical pairs.  
Clustering of Paired Helices. The clustering of paired helices is proposed in order to explain 
the emergence of the broad “mesomorphic” peak in the WAXS profile. This clustering can be a 
result of (1) induced generation of helical pairs around an existing helical pair or more likely (2) 
collision/attachment of neighboring pairs through thermally activated fluctuations or Brownian 
motion. Either of the two routes would be subjected to further balancing force of chain elasticity in 
the entangled melt. The process should again be continuous, as there is still no identifiable heat of 
transformation.  
Nucleation/Growth of βc Crystals and Nonvanishing fm. A more careful examination of 
Figure 4b reveals that, in the temperature range of 150 to 130 °C, fa decreased mildly from ca. 0.62 
to 0.55; development of the crystalline fraction (up to fc ≈ 0.20) was mainly contributed by the 
decrease in fm from 0.38 to 0.25. This signifies extensive formation of βc crystals converted from 
mesomorphic phase and comparatively minor crystal growth in expense of the amorphous fraction. 
In the subsequent range of 130 to 105 °C, the increase in fc from 0.20 to 0.34 was mainly 
contributed by the decrease in fa (from 0. 55 to 0.46) and a minor decrease in fm (0.25 to 0.20).  
Conversion of clusters of paired helices (i.e., the mesomorphic phase) into primary nuclei of 
βc crystals is therefore progressive and incomplete. Mesomorphic clusters are envisioned to 
fluctuate in size and packing order with the balancing elastic forces or thermal fluctuations, similar 
to scenarios reported recently on the basis of molecular dynamic simulation for nucleation of 
polyethylene chains.21 It may be conceived that only those of highly improved packing order while 
exceeding the corresponding critical size may activate subsequent growth; this coincides with the 
classical picture of a discontinuous nucleation process. This critical barrier decreases with 
decreasing temperature yet remains non-vanishing, leaving significant mesomorphic phase fraction 
(fm ≈ 0.20) along with dominant amorphous fraction (fa ≈ 0.46) at the end the crystallization where 
crystallinity fc ≈ 0.34.   
On the basis of Figure 4b, crystal growth is envisaged to proceed in two possible ways. Paired 
10 
 
results will be presented in a separate occasion.  
As a final remark, the present FTIR/WAXS evidences correspond mainly to high-resolution 
molecular processes; hence we have restrained ourselves from discussing the shape/structure of the 
mesomorphic clusters of the helical pairs. This latter issue, however, will be addressed with proper 
analysis of low-resolution SAXS results in the near future. 
 
Conclusion 
Using FTIR, WAXS and DSC, we have investigated the structure evolution of PLLA/PDLA 
stereocomplex during melt crystallization upon slow cooling (1 °C/min) from the equilibrated melt 
state at 270 °C. On the basis of the characteristic 908 cm-1 peak for paired 32/31 helices, we show 
that helical pairs started to emerge in the early stage of cooling below 220 °C. This is followed by 
the clustering of populated helical pairs into mesomorphic precursors (as indicated by a 
mesomorphic peak in the WAXS profile) below 190 °C, which subsequently serve as nucleation 
sites upon further cooling or isothermal standing. The observation that half of the mesomorphic 
clusters (extensively developed, i.e., fm ≈ 0.38, at 150 °C) transformed into crystalline βc phase is 
explained by their participation in both the nucleation and the growth of βc crystals; only half of the 
final crystalline fraction (fc ≈ 0.34 at the end of crystallization process) is attributed to crystal 
growth via the traditional route of surface-nucleation of amorphous chains. We conclude that 
preformed helical pairs in the melt matrix play a dominant role in the crystallization process of 
racemic PLLA/PDLA blend.
