1.  Abstract 
A duplex structure of δ -ferrite and lath 
martensite associated with thin-film retained 
austenite was developed by modifying the 
alloying addition process. The presence of 
δ -ferrite helped refine the grains of austenite 
formed by hot rolling. As a result, there was 
further increase in both the amount and 
stabilization of the retained austenite. It was 
confirmed that tempered martensite 
embrittlement originated from the 
decomposition of the retained austenite. Grain 
refining was also advantageous for reducing 
the severity of tempered martensite 
embrittlement, thereby postponing the onset of 
embrittlement to a higher tempering 
temperature. As a result of the uniform and 
small grains and the large amount of stable 
retained austenite, there was a further 
improvement in the excellent combination of 
mechanical properties. For the same 
tempering treatment, all the mechanical 
properties obtained in the as-rolled condition 
were better than those obtained by direct 
quenching without rolling. After hot rolling, 
however, the increase in hardness and tensile 
strength was not accompanied by any drop in 
the ductility and toughness.

2.  Introduction 
Martensitic stainless steels are widely 
used in turbines and in machine parts that are 
subjected to high stresses in many industrial 
applications [1]. Their high hardenability 
makes them martensitic air-hardenable, 
leading to difficulty in softening them for 
machining and fabrication purposes. Moreover, 
increases in the strength of these materials are 
usually associated with corresponding 
decreases in toughness. With the aim of 
overcoming these problems, in this study, a 
reasonable amount of δ -ferrite was 
introduced into martensitic stainless steels by 
microstructural control via modifications in 
the alloying addition process and heat 
treatment. The development of dual-phase 
steels from conventional low-alloy steels 
consisting of martensite and ferrite phases, in 
which the martensite imparts high strength 
and the ferrite supplies good elongation, can 
produce a desirable combination of strength 
and ductility. 
Some authors [2] have indicated that 
δ -ferrite in martensitic stainless steels may 
have an adverse effect on the mechanical 
properties of these materials at a high 
temperature. But one of the advantages of the 
presence of δ -ferrite is that it causes grain 
refinement of the austenite, a process that 
results in additional strengthening. This effect 
can be accentuated by further refining the 
this investigation is shown in Fig. 1. The 
process included an austenitizing treatment for 
120 min at a temperature 50°C greater than 
the initial rolling temperature of 950°C. Three 
different thicknesses (17.5, 23.5, and 35 mm) 
of the original plates that were 200 mm long 
and 150 mm wide were used for rolling at 
reduction ratios of 20, 40, and 60%, 
respectively. The plates were rolled in a single 
rolling pass using a 700 ton Nippon rolling 
mill with rolls of radius 360 mm. The rolling 
speed was set to 20 rpm. Finally, a plate with a 
thickness of 14 mm was produced in all cases. 
A K-type thermocouple was inserted into one 
side of the plate to measure the temperature of 
the sample continuously during the rolling 
process. All the finish rolling temperatures 
were higher than 900°C in this study. After 
rolling, the plates were cooled in air to room 
temperature then tempered at 200, 300, 400, 
500, and 600°C for 120 min and finally, at 
least 2 mm of material from each side of the 
plates was machined off to remove the 
decarburization layer. 
 
3.3 Microstructural characterization 
Metallographic examination was carried 
out using scanning and transmission electron 
microscopes. Samples for metallography were 
prepared by using standard techniques and 
these were etched in Fry reagent (5 g CuCl2, 
40 ml HCl, 30 ml H2O, 25 ml alcohol). Image 
analysis of the as-received microstructure was 
performed to determine the δ -ferrite content 
(percentage area quantification). For TEM, 
thin foils were obtained from broken Charpy 
pieces. Slices with a thickness of about 0.25 
mm were cut and thinned down to 0.05 mm by 
abrasion with silicon carbide papers. 
Three-millimeter discs were punch cut form 
these slices and then twin-jet electropolished 
using a mixture of 5% perchloric, 20% 
glycerol, and 75% ethanol at ambient 
temperature and 40 V polishing potential. The 
electron transparent thin foils were examined 
using a JEOL 100CX transmission electron 
microscope operated at 100 kV and 40 mA. 
Fractography was conducted on the broken 
Charpy samples using a JEOL JSM-5600 
scanning electron microscope operated at 30 
kV and 40 mA.  
  
3.4 Mechanical testing 
Hardness samples with dimensions of 20 
× 20 × 10 mm and erosion samples with 
dimensions of 50 × 35 × 6 mm were cut from 
the middle of the plates. Standard Charpy 
samples and 6.25 mm standard sub-size 
tensile samples were machined out of the 
rolled plates along the longitudinal direction 
of rolling. Hardness testing of the bulk 
material was performed using a Rockwell 
hardness tester. At least five hardness readings 
were recorded and then averaged. All the 
Rockwell hardness readings were converted 
into Vickers hardness numbers. Tensile testing 
was carried out on an MTS testing machine at 
a constant strain rate of 10–3s–1. Impact tests 
were carried out by using a Charpy impact 
tester. For each set of the samples, every 
tensile and impact test was repeated at least 
three times and the results were averaged.  
 
4.  Results and discussion 
4.1 Microstructural characteristics 
Fig. 2(a) shows the microstructure of the 
experimental steel in the as-received state. A 
banded structure consisting of approximately 
68% martensite and 32% δ -ferrite was 
observed. This is close to the result estimated 
by the Schaeffler diagram. Fig. 2(b) is a 
typical example of martensite packets, 
consisting of autotempered lath martensite and 
thin films of retained austenite at the lath 
boundaries. Fig. 2(c) shows the corresponding 
dark-field image. Some blocky islands of 
the martensite laths (Fig. 4(e)). The Cr23C6 
carbides formed due to the decomposition of 
the interlath films of the retained austenite. 
Fig. 5 shows the microstructures of the 
sample as rolled with a reduction ratio of 60% 
and then tempered at various temperature. 
There is no significant difference in the 
morphologies of the ferrite and martensite in 
these samples as compared to those in the 0% 
reduction sample. However, two important 
substructural aspects were observed in this 
case. The number of dislocations was 
significantly higher than that in the 0% 
reduction sample (Fig. 5(a)). Although 
dislocations in austenite could 
heterogeneously assist in the nucleation of 
carbides [16], these dislocations in the 
martensitic matrix also provided carbon atoms 
with sites that were lower in energy than those 
provided by normal interstitial lattice 
positions [17]. Therefore, the first step in 
tempering at a lower temperature was the 
redistribution of the carbon atoms to these 
lower energy sites. It appears that the severe 
deformation that discouraged carbide 
nucleation and growth could postpone the 
onset of tempered martensite embrittlement to 
a higher temperature. The second aspect is the 
presence of carbides. With tempering at 200°C, 
the retained austenite was stable. M3C or 
Cr7C3 carbides were observed until tempering 
at 300°C (Fig. 5(b)). This interlath carbide 
increased and coarsened following tempering 
at 400°C (Fig. 5(c)). Upon tempering at 500°C 
and 600°C, Cr23C6 carbides were found and 
their precipitation sites were mainly at the 
grain boundaries rather than at the boundaries 
of the martensite laths, as shown in Fig. 
5(d)−(e). However, the 60% reduction sample 
exhibited a smaller degree of tempered 
martensite embrittlement, in terms of the size 
and distribution of the carbides. 
 
4.4  Correlation of mechanical properties 
with microstructure 
The mechanical properties for the four 
reduction ratios are plotted as a function of the 
tempering temperature in Fig. 6 and 7. It is 
known that lath martensitic steels are 
susceptible to tempered martensite 
embrittlement, which is associated with the 
decomposition of the interlath films of the 
retained austenite into coarse interlath 
carbides [18−20]. It occurs when the steel is 
tempered in the temperature range of 200 to 
500°C. With tempering at 200°C and 300°C, 
M3C carbides were precipitated in the 
martensitic matrix, and they coarsened with 
tempering at 400°C. This caused a gentle 
increase in the hardness and tensile strength 
(Fig. 6) and a small decrease in the elongation 
and impact energy (Fig. 7). With tempering at 
500°C, the secondary strengthening effect was 
evident. This phenomenon may be due to the 
precipitation of Cr23C6 carbides at the 
boundaries of the martensite laths and in the 
martensitic matrix. The highest values of the 
hardness and tensile strength and the lowest 
values of the elongation and impact energy 
were obtained at this condition. In the case of 
tempering at 600°C, due to the softening of 
the martensite and the precipitation of Cr23C6 
carbides mainly at the grain boundaries, the 
hardness and tensile strength reduced rapidly 
(Fig. 6), while the elongation and impact 
energy improved significantly (Fig. 7). 
Hot rolling has a strong influence on the 
mechanical properties, primarily due to the 
degree of prior deformation of the austenite 
grains and grain refinement by 
recrystallization. In this case, the mechanical 
properties of samples rolled with different 
reduction ratios (20, 40, and 60%) and post 
tempering were compared with those obtained 
by conventional quenching and tempering 
without rolling (0%). The effectiveness of 
that this occurs due to the mutually 
opposing tendencies of the fine grain size 
and increased retained austenite following 
grain refinement.  
(3) The secondary strengthening effect 
evidently occurs with tempering at 500°C. 
This phenomenon may be due to the 
precipitation of Cr23C6 carbides at the 
boundaries of the martensite laths. After 
rolling, the toughness and ductility of the 
material are quite good even in this case. 
(4) It was shown that improvements in the 
hardness and tensile strength are not 
accompanied by a drop in the ductility and 
toughness, which may be achieved by 
prior hot rolling. This is thus a 
combination of the benefits of attaining a 
large amount of stable retained austenite 
and a fine-grained structure. All the 
mechanical properties of the steels after 
hot rolling are superior to those obtained 
after quenching directly without rolling for 
the same tempering treatment.
