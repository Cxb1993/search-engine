2developed for studying the problems
containing straight cracks in orthotropic
FGMs (e.g. Gu and Asaro [7], Ozturk and
Erdogan [8], Kim and Paulino [9], etc). As
to curved cracks, numerous researches have
been carried out for homogeneous materials,
either isotropic (e.g. Sih et al. [10], Dreilich
and Gross [11], Chen [12], etc.) or
anisotropic (e.g. Obata et al. [13], Xu and
Keer [14], etc.) solids. Nevertheless, more
detailed investigations on the near-tip
singular behavior for cracks of arbitrary
curved shape in generally anisotropic FGMs
are still in need.
The mixed-mode stresses around a
singular point in linear elasticity can be
characterized by a pair of stress intensity
factors (SIFs). Due to the complicated
mechanical state around the singular point,
direct evaluation of the SIFs with numerical
schemes such as finite element method
appears to be difficult. Instead, the SIFs are
usually determined by using various types of
contour and/or domain integrals, e.g., the
Jk-integrals (k=1,2) (Budiansky and Rice
[15]), H-integral (Stern et al. [16]), and
M1-integral (Chen and Shield [17]), etc.
These integrals were originally developed for
problems containing a straight crack in
homogeneous materials. For problems
containing curved cracks, the conventional
concept of the above integrals is no longer
valid and needs to be modified. A number
of modified integrals have therefore been
presented for curved cracks in homogeneous
materials, either isotropic (e.g. Beom et al.
[18], Lorentzon and Eriksson [19], etc) or
anisotropic (Chang and Wu [20]) solids.
Note that the asymptotic singular behavior in
the near-tip region always needs to be
included in calculating the mixed-mode SIFs
by using any of the aforementioned integrals.
In order to use the above integrals for
evaluation of mixed-mode fracture
parameters in FGMs, their formulation needs
to be further modified. For problems
containing a straight crack in isotropic FGMs,
the modified Jk-integrals (Kim and Paulino
[21]) and the domain integral (Gu et al. [22])
have been presented. Also, variations of the
interactive integral have been used for
straight cracks in isotropic (Dolbow and
Gosz [23], Rao and Rahman [24]) and
orthotropic (Rao and Rahman [25]) FGMs.
Note that, in order to perform some of these
integrals, proper auxiliary solutions
associated with the prescribed material
behavior and crack geometry are required.
Therefore, more study is required for general
formulation should problems containing
curved cracks of arbitrary shape in
anisotropic FGMs be considered.
The object of this proposed research is
to evaluate the mixed-mode stress intensity
factors for a curved crack in anisotropic
FGMs. A numerical procedure, by
modifying the concept of the Jk-integrals, is
to be developed for this purpose. Since no
extra auxiliary or complementary solutions
are required in their formulation, this
approach is thus anticipated to be applicable
for problems of arbitrary curved shapes and
general anisotropic FGMs. The approach is
to be developed and incorporated with the
finite element method for numerical
calculation. No particular singular elements
are used in the study.
三、Asymptotic Stress Fields in Anisotropic
FGMs
For a 2-D anisotropic elastic FGM
containing a crack of arbitrary curved shape
(Figure 1), a global coordinate system x1-x2
originating at an arbitrarily chosen point O is
introduced. The position vector at the crack
tip O' is denoted . The spatial variation in
FGMs results in varying elastic compliance,
where the corresponding Cartesian
components Cij(x) are assumed to be
continuous, bounded, and differentiable
functions of the position vector x. With this,
the stress-strain relations can be written as
11= C11(x)11+C12(x)22+C16(x)12
22 = C12(x)11+C22(x)22+C26(x)12
12 = C16(x)11+C26(x)22+C66(x)12,
where (11,22,12)and (11,22,12) are the
strain and the stress components.
It has been shown (e.g. [1]-[3]) that, in
FGMs, the asymptotic near-tip stresses
maintain the inverse square root singularity
and have the same form as those of the
homogeneous materials. To express the
asymptotic stress field for such a curved
4enclosed by o and terminated at the tip O'.
Also, the domain A includes the crack tip
area in the limiting condition whenshrinks
onto O' (again, this limiting case is not
shown in Figure 1). By applying
divergence theorem under the state of
equilibrium, we can have the Jk-integrals
rewritten. It is thus indicated that the idea
of path-independence needs to be modified
by including an arbitrarily chosen remote
contouro and the domain A, along with part
of the crack surfaces D1+D2.
In the domain integral over A, the area
near the crack tip O' is always included.
Also, the line segments D1 and D2 should
both be terminated at the crack tip.
Therefore, while the remote contour o can
be arbitrarily chosen, the asymptotic singular
behavior in the near-tip area is inevitably
involved due to the presence of these
additional integrals. Cautious investigation
is thus necessary in the calculation.
六、On the Singular Behavior
In order to accurately evaluate the
Jk-integrals, we consider that part of the
integrations can be separated as
∫ Wn'k ds =∫        Wn'k ds +D1+D2 (D1–R)+(D2–R) 0
R∫<W>n'k ds, k=1,20
where AR is the subarea of the region A
where singular behavior dominates (Figure 2);
A–AR is the part of A, from which the cutoff
area AR is subtracted; R denotes the length
along the crack surfaces where singular
behavior dominates; D1–R and D2–R are the
portions of D1 and D2, from which the cutoff
length R are subtracted; <W> denotes the
contribution due to the jump of the strain
energy density across the crack surfaces.
Note that, while the first terms on the RHS of
the above equations can be accurately
evaluated by using finite elements, the last
terms of these two equations may cause
difficulty in computation and further studies
are in need.
In order to accurately evaluate the
integrals, the asymptotic mechanical
behavior of the strain energy density and
<W> for anisotropic FGMs in the near-tip
region needs to be first investigated, then
followed by proposition of a treatment for the
singular behavior.
七、Numerical Example
We consider again the plane strain
specimen containing a circular arc crack
(Figure 3). The SIFs associated with crack
tip O' are determined after the Jk-integrals
being properly evaluated by using finite
elements.
In the following study, the
non-homogeneity parameter is taken to be
varied from 0.0 to 1.5/l. Also, in order to
investigate the effects due to material
anisotropy, three instances of stiffness ratio
(i.e. with isotropic, 2=0.5, and 2=0.8) are
considered. As to the geometric condition,
two different arc angles (i.e. =45o and 90o)
are considered. The SIFs are then evaluated
under varying combinations of material
nonhomogeneity and anisotropy. The
normalized results of KI/p(l)1/2 and
KII/p(l)1/2, for =45o, are shown in Figures
4(a) and 4(b), where each curve represents
the relation between the SIFs and the
non-homogeneity parameter under different
values of material orthotropy. Also, the
normalized results of KI/p(l)1/2 and
KII/p(l)1/2, for =90o, are shown in Figures
5(a) and 5(b).
When the angle of the circular arc
crack extends to 45o, the values of KI/p(l)1/2
decrease drastically to the lowest as the
non-homogeneity parameter varying from
0.0 to (approximately) 0.4/l, and then
increase gradually as varying from 0.4/l to
1.5/l (Figures 4(a)). As to KII/p(l)1/2, it is
observed that this second mode factor
changes sign and becomes negative as the
value of increases (Figures 4(b)).
Particularly, the value of KII/p(l)1/2 appears
to vanish asymptotically for 2=0.5. In
general, it is noted that, when the material is
homogeneous (i.e., =0), the values of the
SIFs decrease as the stiffness ratio 
decreases. Nevertheless, the values of the
