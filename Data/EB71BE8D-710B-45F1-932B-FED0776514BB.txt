一、計畫的緣由與目的 
何謂前瞻優質生活環境科技？讓我們先
看看下列情境： 
 
4 
築模擬實驗室等[12]。 
國科會最近為了推展「科文共裕」，分別
在北中南各設一個智慧家庭科技創新與整合
中心，也就是台大的Insight center[13]，交大的
Eco-city center[14] ， 以 及 成 大 的 Touch 
center[15]等三個區域整合中心；而鄰近國家比
較有名的有 Panasonic 的The house of the 
Future[16]，以及韓國的u-Home[17] 等，由上
述說明不難看出，數位生活科技的重要性與發
展的迫切性。 
本計畫的目的，是研究與開發「前瞻優質
生活環境科技」，而以無所不在、或稱為U 化
（Ubiquiteous）的服務為訴求，將U 化技術實
現在日常生活關係最密切的生活環境--廚房與
餐廳之中，並將對廚房U 化之需求、技術、實
現、使用評估與回饋等，做一系列的研究與開
發。首先，根據不動產經營專家的經驗，目前
住宅的發展趨勢可以歸納出下列幾點： 
 現代化住宅設備日新月異，光是大投資購
置豪華設備已經不符市場需求，必須進一
步提升為智慧化才能重新贏得消費者的
青睞。 
 現代女性為家庭生活中心，居家時間最
長，尊重女性的設計將是未來住宅設計的
主流趨勢。 
 廚房與餐廳為家庭中，全家人每天必須使
用到的環境，特別是對於老人與小孩而
言，提供友善、安全、舒適、方便、與健
康的環境是極為重要的。 
 現代科技都朝向節能與環保的方向在努
力，因此智慧型廚房也必須結合節能環保
的設計理念。 
 
內政部建研所長丁育群曾經表示：「預估
到公元2015 年，全球數位化居住空間所衍生
之相關產業將達1000 億美元之產值，高度數
位化的智慧居住生活系統，將成為居住生活設
施中最重要的一環」。內政部建築研究所「智
慧建築標章」審查委員會召集人、中國文化大
學溫琇玲教授更對「智慧化居住空間」做進一
步說明：所謂智慧化居住空間，絕對不只是將
建築予與資訊化、網路化與自動化而已，必須
是透過資訊基礎建設，結合電子、電機、資通
訊相關產業技術與自動化設備，建構智慧化居
住空間，創造及享有安全、健康、便利、舒適
與永續經營的生活形態。 
這裡所謂的「智慧居住生活系統」、或者
是「智慧化居住空間」，又叫做「優質家庭生
活」（U-Home: ubiquitous home life ），是利
用無所不在(ubiquitous)的服務技術，來創造未
來生活環境的新模式，讓未來的生活能夠與家
人分享更多的時間，同時又能提升工作的愉
快；在溫和、方便的無所不在之社會，世界都
是親密的鄰居。 
另一方面，廚房與餐廳不但是家中女主人
的主要活動區域，也是家中不分老少每天都必
須使用的場所，尤其是目前的住宅買賣市場，
常常是由女主人決定，而女主人最在意的當然
是廚房與餐廳的方便性與舒適性。因此，本計
畫的願景在於使用有線及無線通訊技術，例如
網際網路、RFID、以及ZigBee 等，將其應用
並實現在未來優質家庭生活所需的各項技術
裡面，尤其是使用在廚房與餐廳的各項產品與
技術，讓家中的女主人享受無所不在的智慧，
具體減輕女主人的工作壓力，讓優質智慧家庭
的科技得以真正發揮功效。 
於是，本團隊決定將專題的研究目標鎖定
在廚房的U 化方面，換句話說，家庭成員只要
在廚房或餐廳裡面，就可以擁有無所不在的服
務，而可以克服空間的限制，例如，可以在廚
房操控其他房間的電燈而不必走到其他房間
去關燈，再如可以在廚房打影像電話而不必走
到客廳或書房的電腦前面，又如可以在餐廳直
接和門口的訪客對話並操作大門的開與關而
不必走到大門，另如可以在餐桌觀看新聞，打
互動遊戲等等，都是所謂「無所不在的服務」。 
本整合型計畫的總體目標在於結合「科技
類」、「商業類」、「藝術類」、以及「健康
類」等各種不同專長領域的研究團隊，分工合
作來研究跨領域優質生活環境相關技術，希望
藉由商業類的需求分析與滿意度回饋的專
長，來確保研究開發的產品可以真正符合消費
者的需求，也就是讓產品開發的程序是先有需
求、再尋找可用技術，而有別於習見之純技術
研究，等技術開發出來之後、再勉強找應用配
對的窘境；至於產品開發之時，不但有藝術專
6 
線燈光控制系統、餐桌椅等予與U 化，分別由
子計畫二、三、四來研製。這裡所謂的U 化，
是將功能提升到「無所不在的服務」，例如，
餐桌上可以看到冰箱的資訊；再如，餐桌上可
以觀看房子內所有電燈的開關狀態，當然，也
可以由餐桌直接關閉電燈，讓隨手關燈變得更
容易，就算一時忘記，也可以很容易補救，真
正達到省能的目標。而既然是無所不在的服
務，餐桌上有的功能，冰箱上樣樣不能少，因
此，大量的資訊將在網路線上流動，也因此需
要一個子計畫專門幫團隊開發與管理網路，這
就是子計畫五—網路信息整合中心。 
由於無線網路系統在家庭的應用有日漸
普及的趨勢，其中又以ZigBee 最被看好。而
既然是無線傳輸，天線的設計就變得非常重
要，天線做得好，就有可能在不影響信號品質
的情況下，將打到人體的電磁波盡量降低，讓
無線網路的使用變得更健康。子計畫六的工作
就是要設計並實現團隊所需的天線。只是，電
腦與通訊系、或者說崑山科技大學目前尚缺電
磁波的無反射室，對於天線設計而言還是有些
不方便，其會影響到設計天線的效率，還好，
總計畫在第二年已經購置電磁波的無反射室
而解決問題。 
  
三、期中進度 
本計畫共包含七個子計畫，其中子計畫一
為本計畫的先鋒部隊，負責研究與調查使用者
之需求，以提供正確的研究方向給其他子計畫
參考，是本期計畫最重要的成果，尤其今年度
做的是本計畫所期望的使用者之深入訪談，其
結果更具參考價值。今將子計畫一的研究結果
說明如下： 
 
3.1 消費者對於智慧化廚房的心理認知對以
使用者為中心之規劃設計之回饋(子計畫一
期中成果) 
 
本研究為子計畫一之期中成果，主要為
衡量使用者在與 U 化廚具互動過程中的心理
感受，採用「情境設計」的研究方法，以焦
點群體訪談的設計，蒐集使用者的意見，使
設計師了解使用者心理的感受。將分析結果
提出具體結論回饋給設計者作為後續階段設
計參考，以及已完成之產品設計的修改提案。 
本研究採用質化的焦點群體訪談法，蒐集
廚房主要使用者對智慧化廚房的期望，幫助
設計者深入的了解廚房主要使用者之需求。
研究結果顯示如下： 
1.家庭主婦希望廚房和用餐空間成為家人互
動與感情培養的場所 
家庭主婦的生活是以「家」為重心，但因
為丈夫工作忙碌、小孩幾乎天天補習，家人在
家中用餐時間、次數不多，導致家庭主婦備餐
次數也大量減少。家庭主婦越來越注重家中成
員在家時的相處時間，因此希望廚房和用餐空
間成為家人互動與感情培養的場所。 
首先，訪談時家庭主婦因為其每天在家中
的時間較長，家務處理的時間較不受限制。因
此，其主要需求與快速處理家務無關，而是希
望智慧化廚房中能夠保有溫馨的感覺並且不
要太過電器化。因為與家人的相處時間不多，
在用餐時間家人間面對面的談話與互動更為
珍貴。 
2.職業婦女希望廚房能有簡單、乾淨和有效率
的設備，減少女性的負擔 
在職業婦女方面，平日除了要工作外，回
到家中還要準備晚餐、洗衣、打掃整理家中環
境，因此對台灣的職業婦女而言，仍是家中主
要的家事負擔者，必須同時承受家庭與工作的
雙重壓力。 
目前許多雙薪家庭，全家人一同用餐的機
會也較少，常常購買外食回家食用，用餐地點
亦容易由餐廳轉至客廳。所以在廚房設計上希
望能以簡單、乾淨的基本設備為主即可。 
因此，訪談時職業婦女首先提出，因為每
天可備餐時間較短，希望能透過智慧化廚房協
助他們更快速、方便的處理家務，例如：縮短
備餐與前置作業時間、切菜或烹飪機器、廚餘
處理回收的協助…等，減少其每天回到家後從
事家務所耗費的精力與時間。 
其次，希望廚房除了智慧化外，還能包括
整個「空間」的融合，在空間中融入「溝通互
動」的元素。因為，職業婦女回家後，剛好也
8 
置之驅動可能會失效，但接上市電恐另有安全
顧慮，遇天災而停電時，既無法用電鍋也無法
用瓦斯爐煮飯菜；（e）電子式瓦斯爐可提供
定時自動關閉之功能，操作面板為液晶顯示居
多，部分機種有翻掀式操作介面之設計；（f）
瓦斯熄滅裝置仍為機械式，並非安裝在瓦斯管
路上，遇管線洩漏問題無法停止瓦斯供應；（g）
因近年石油價格高漲，瓦斯費用增加，加上瓦
斯安全問題，導致有部分家庭改用電爐之傾
向。本子計畫對於瓦斯安全的設計，結論為：
（a）瓦斯洩漏之偵測除了爐具本身之外，應
置於廚房或其他使用瓦斯等之室內場所亦須
裝設瓦斯感應器；（b）爐具除了本身之偵測
與控制功能外，亦須連結其他感應器，並透過
廚房安全子系統或訊息中心運作，才能進一步
確保安全；（c）遇天災時須有應變措施，防
止電子系統失效。本子計畫擬於下年度採購一
台市售之電子瓦斯爐，進行改良之研究，並建
立安全子系統與訊息中心聯結。 
行為分析方面，目前已完成雙眼攝影機硬
體建置，藉由觀測物件及熱源的相對位置可計
算其距離；當距離過近時，系統將傳送警告給
訊息整合中心，以作進一步處理。 
無線燈光控制系統方面，本年度完成以
ZigBee為基礎的無線室內燈光控制系統，也完
成具有ZigBee介面的語音遙控器，可以使用語
音遙控器操作家中燈光系統而可以完全不必
使用手動操作。 
另外，本子計畫也將語音遙控技術應用於
自動咖啡機的操作，將台製汭星咖啡機裝上語
音控制器，讓咖啡機可以輸出語音和使用者打
招呼，輸出語音提示使用者的選項，還會辨識
使用者所下的語音命令，再根據使用者的語音
命令沖泡濃縮咖啡或者是美式咖啡。本作品於
2010年6月18-20日參加美國匹茲堡發明展，得
到 評 審 極 高 的 評 價 ， 而 獲 得 休 閒 組
(recreation)金牌獎。

(3) 子計畫四期中成果 
子計畫四今年的目標是開發以人因工程
的技術設計的智慧型椅子，它可依使用者的身
份自動做高度、椅背角度、扶手高度調整，還
有體重、體脂肪檢測等功能；除此以外，配合
智慧桌的使用，除了可讓智慧椅上的資訊顯示
於智慧桌上，隨著資訊的提醒，隨時提醒自己
挺胸、縮腹、直腰、坐如懸鐘，阻止脂肪沉積；
更可利用智慧桌資訊平台的功能，提供個人喜
愛網頁、新聞、遊戲、通訊及信件等服務，也
可透過網路平台掌控家中所有資訊家電，提供
無所不在的服務。 
本子計畫的實現分為軟體及硬體兩方
面，在軟體部分已完成伺服馬達及交流馬達位
置控制、類比轉數位程式、數位信號輸出/入
程式等；在硬體實現已完成體重計、心跳計等
電路之製作。目前智慧椅硬體機構的設計已接
近完成，等待其的模擬後，即可施工製作；而
整合設計部分也在積極的執行中，但需等待硬
體機構的完成後，方可與其他硬體功能接合做
整合測試。

Abstract  —  This paper proposed an architecture of an SRR 
transceiver for the applications in multi-target automotive 
environment. The millimeter-wave radar signal is phase-
modulated by a specified Gold code sequence to make the 
reflection signal be capable of identification via auto-correlation. 
A 24-GHz PSK transmitter for the SRR application is also 
implemented. The original VCO frequency is designed at 12 
GHz to release the constrictions of the CMOS process. 
Differential switches are employed in the transmitter for the 
purposes of the frequency doubling and the phase modulation. 
The PSK transmitter of the SRR transceiver is demonstrated in 
TSMC 0.13-um CMOS process. The chip size is 1.03 × 0.93 mm2. 
The measurement results show that the free-running frequency 
of the VCO in the chip is around 10 GHz and the doubled 
frequency is around 20 GHz. The phase modulator is also tested 
under a baseband frequency of 1 GHz and the result shows that 
it is functional work. 
Index Terms — Automotive, CMOS, differential switch, Gold 
code, radar, SRR. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Recently, considerable concern has arisen over short range 
radar (SRR) in millimeter-wave automotive radar systems [1-
6]. In US, 24-GHz band is already granted unlimited in time 
by US regulation authority - Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) in 2002. A bandwidth of 5-GHz UWB in 
the 24-GHz range (24.125 ± 2.5 GHz) is available in USA 
for automotive applications. In Europe, on 17 Jan, 2005, 
European Commission (EC) approved 24 GHz frequency 
band for automotive short range radar (21.625 - 26.625 GHz) 
is allocated for the temporary use of ultra-wideband (UWB) 
automotive short range radar. 24-GHz SRR technology 
allows a low-cost design at reasonable cost today and can 
keep the product size small enough to fit in the space 
available while providing useful range resolution and object 
separation which is needed for Cartesian object tracking. A 
typical car environment generally consists of more than one 
object. The SRR system must therefore be multi-target 
capable and have an interface to the CAN-bus for today’s 
automotive applications.  
Numerous attempts have been made by scholars to 
demonstrate 24-GHz front-end research [7-11]. 
Unfortunately, the CMOS technology has lower cut-off 
frequency (ft) and larger parasitic capacitance makes voltage 
control oscillator (VCO) hard to deliver output power for 
working frequency above 20 GHz. Hence sub-harmonic 
mixers are attractive for millimeter-wave systems, and 
benefit from the capability of working with a local-oscillator 
(LO) frequency that is a fraction of the frequency of 
incoming RF signals. This paper is organized as follows. 
First, in Section II, the SRR transmitter architecture is 
introduced. Each circuit block is depicted in section III.  
Demonstrations of the phase-shift keying (PSK) transmitter is 
characterized in section IV. Finally, concise conclusions are 
drawn in section V.  
II. SRR TRANSMITTER ARCHITECTURE 
This paper proposed the system architecture of the SRR 
transceiver which can be applied in multi-target car 
environment. Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the system 
which consists of a VCO, a Gold code generator, an up-
conversion phase modulator, a bi-phase demodulator, and 
two down-conversion I/Q mixers. The PSK transmitter of the 
fabricated chip is inserted in the transmitter path which is 
shown in the red block of Fig. 1. SRR signal is generated by 
VCO first. Then it is modulated by the up-conversion phase 
modulator which is controlled by the Gold code sequence. 
The phase modulation makes the transmitted signal be 
capable of identification via auto-correlation when it is 
reflected by objects. It is very important that the reflected 
signal is able to be identified in multi-target applications.  
 
Fig. 1. The architecture of the proposed SRR transceiver. 
 
 The identification process begins with a bi-phase 
demodulator which is controlled by the same Gold code 
sequence as the transmitter but some delay is inserted. In case 
that the delayed Gold code sequence is matched with the 
reflected signal, the reflected signal will be converted into 
only one phase. Then the following I/Q mixers can detect the 
single-phase signal strength easily without the help of the 
978-1-4244-2802-1/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE
source, the bias current was directly controlled by choosing 
the transistor size. In order to fit the condition of the 
differential Colpitts oscillator, one on-chip symmetrical 
inductor with a center-tap is inserted in VCO as the tank 
circuit. 
C. The sub-harmonic frequency doubler 
A sub-harmonic frequency doubler is a circuit which 
converts signals from low frequency to twice of the original 
frequency. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the frequency doubler 
consists of two RC-CR circuits, amplifiers, and a differential 
switch. The working waveforms of the circuit can be shown 
in Fig. 5(b). Here assumes that the original signals before the 
frequency doubler are large enough to turn the transistors of 
the differential switch into saturation state. With the self-
mixing of the same signal but quadrature phase difference via 
the differential switch, it is clear that the frequency of the 
output pulse is doubled. From Fig. 5(b), it also easy to 
understand intuitively that exactly 90o phase difference 
between the RF and LO input signals will let the differential 
switch to output the maximum power of the doubled signal.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND MEASUREMENTS 
The proposed PSK transmitter for the 24-GHz UWB SRR 
applications is carefully simulated in TSMC 0.13-um CMOS 
process before the chip fabrication. Fig. 6 shows the 
simulated waveforms including the 1-Gbps Gold code 
sequence, the 24-GHz original signal, and the 24-GHz  
modulated signal. Fig. 7 shows the die micrograph. The chip 
size is 1.03 x 0.93 mm2.  
The chip is measured under a power supply of 1.2 V. The 
core circuit consumes a current around 26 mA. The chip is 
measured on a probe station with a 30-GHz spectrum 
analyzer (FSL of R&S) connected. The control voltage of 
VCO is short to ground. The measured spectrum is shown in 
Fig. 8. Two spectrums, allocated at 9.8 GHz and 19.6 GHz 
respectively, are found. It means the VCO is working at 9.8 
GHz and the frequency doubler mixes the signal up to 19.6 
GHz. Fig. 9 shows the output spectrum of the phase 
modulator under the condition that the phase modulator is 
connected to the output of the frequency doubler (19.6 GHz) 
and an external 1-GHz analog signal which is used as a 
baseband signal in this test. The measurement result shows 
that two spectrums, allocated around 19 GHz and 21 GHz 
respectively, are generated. It certifies that the phase 
modulator is functional work.

Abstract  —This paper proposes a new topology of a 
millimeter-wave triple-mode programmable frequency divider. 
An example of its application at the working frequency of 24 
GHz is also demonstrated in TSMC 0.13-μm CMOS process. It 
consists of a mixer, a BPF, a CML divider and three pairs of 
switches. Under proper control of those switches, the proposed 
divider can offer three division mode of 1/2, 1/3 and 1/4. The 
divider core consumption is simulated to be 13.5 mW under a 
supply voltage of 1.2 V. In divide-by-two mode, the divider 
works from 15 to 26 GHz and the best input sensitivity is 0.1 Vp 
at 16 GHz. In divide-by-three mode, the divider still works from 
15 to 26 GHz but the best input sensitivity slightly shifts to 0.13 
Vp at 25 GHz. In divide-by-four mode, the divider is simulated 
to work from 19 to 24 GHz with a maximum input sensitivity of 
0.32 Vp at 22 GHz.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizers are 
essential building blocks in modern integrated transceivers 
operating at millimeter-wave frequency [1]. A critical part of 
every PLL frequency synthesizer is the frequency divider 
chain, which implements frequency division of the voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) output to make it equal to the 
reference signal frequency. The first stage of the frequency 
divider chain often needs high speed and high input 
sensitivity for being applied in millimeter-wave frequency 
synthesizer. Besides, CMOS technology has higher cut-off 
frequency under the continuously decreasing channel length. 
Some reported dividers have achieved an operating frequency 
of greater than 20 GHz in CMOS process, such as the 
dynamic circuit [2], the static divider [3]-[5], the injection-
locked oscillator [6], and the regenerative divider [7]-[8]. 
However, each of the above dividers offers only a fixed 
division for the limitation of the circuit topology. 
In this paper, we propose a topology of a triple-mode 
programmable frequency divider (TPFD). Three divisions, 
1/2, 1/3, and 1/4, are implemented on the same chip to work 
under a maximum operating frequency of 26 GHz in TSMC 
CMOS 0.13-um process as a demonstration example.

II. TOPOLOGY DESCRIPTIONS 
Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the proposed TPFD, 
which consists of a radio-frequency (RF) mixer, a band-pass 
filter (BPF), a divide-by-two static divider, and three pairs of 
programmable switches defined to be connected in ‘ON’ 
state and to be opened in ‘OFF’ state. 
Fig. 2(a) shows the equivalent block diagram of the 
proposed topology when SW1 and SW3 are both ‘ON’ but 
SW2 is ‘OFF’. It is a topology of a regenerative divide-by-
two frequency divider [9]. The RF mixer has two input 
frequencies, fin at the RF port and fLO at the local port 
individually. The output frequencies of the mixer will be the 
summation and subtraction of those frequencies, e.g. fin ± fLO 
in this example. Because the output port is connected back to 
the local port, that is fLO = fout, the divider in Fig. 2(a) can be 
stated as Equation (1) if a high pass filter is added right after 
the mixer to remove the high band frequency fin + fout. 
 outoutin fff =−  (1) 
From the solution of Equation (1), the function of divide-
by-two is proved.  
In the divide-by-three mode as shown in Fig. 2(b), it is the 
equivalent block diagram of the proposed topology when 
SW1 is ‘OFF’ but SW2 and SW3 are both ‘ON’. Compared 
with Fig. 2(a), a static divide-by-two block is inserted before 
the output port and the divider can be stated as Equation (2) 
which can be solved to verify the function of divide-by-three. 
 outoutin fff =÷− 2)(  (2) 
capacitances in the output stages which will slow the 
operating speed of the latch and then reduce the maximum 
working frequency of the static divider, a center-tapped 
inductor in series with resistors are introduced to lightly 
resonate with those parasitic capacitances at the working 
frequency for the compensation purpose. In addition, for the 
well bias condition, all transistors in CML latch have been 
designed in the same size of a gate length of 0.13 μm and a 
gate width of 20 μm which lets the divider work up to a 
maximum frequency of 18 GHz.

B. Simulation Results 
An example of a 24-GHz TPFD is demonstrated in TSMC 
0.13-um CMOS process in this paper. The circuit layout 
shown in Fig. 6 is designed in Cadence. Both DRC and LVS 
are carefully checked to confirm the layout can be fabricated 
in TSMC process and it is exactly the same as the schematic. 
The post-simulation, including LPE and EM simulation, is 
checked in ADS. The post-layout simulation shows the 
designed TPFD has a maximum operating frequency of 26 
GHz under a supply voltage of 1.2 V and a core power 
consumption of 13.5 mW. 
Figure 7 shows the post-simulation of the designed TPFD 
in divide-by-two mode. The transient simulation shows that 
the input signal is 0.6 Vp at 24 GHz and the divided output is 
0.13 Vp at 12 GHz. It is then verified to work properly in 
divide-by-two mode. In Figure 8, the transient simulation of 
the divide-by-three mode of the designed TPFD is checked. 
The input signal of 0.6 Vp at 24 GHz and the output signal of 
0.06 Vp at 8 GHz shows that the circuit is exactly working 
under the condition of divide-by-three. Figure 9 shows the 
input and the output transient waveforms in the divide-by-
four mode. Similarly, the input signal of 0.6 Vp at 24 GHz 
and the output signal of 0.15 Vp at 6 GHz verifies that the 
circuit works well.  
Figure 10 shows the post-simulation of the input sensitivity 
versus input frequency. In divide-by-two mode, the TPFD 
has a working rang from 15 to 26 GHz with a maximum 
input sensitivity of 0.1 Vp at 16 GHz. In divide-by-three 
mode, the designed TPFD still has a working rang from 15 to 
26 GHz but the maximum input sensitivity slightly shifts to  
0.13 Vp at 25 GHz. In divide-by-four mode, the TPFD only 
has a narrow working rang from 19 to 24 GHz and a 
maximum input sensitivity of 0.32 Vp at 22 GHz.

Key words: living space, smart kitchen, importance, demand 
I. Introduction 
 
1.1 Preface 
 
    In view of global climate change and rising international energy prices, energy-saving and 
carbon reduction has become a universal value. According to the Bureau of Energy, a division of 
Ministry of Economic, Monthly Energy indicators showed that from 1990 to 2008, residential 
and commercial electricity consumption increased from 20.85% to 23.26% in Taiwan's total 
consumption.  In particular, 11.54% of electricity consumption was used in residential section 
(Bureau of Energy, 2009). Therefore, in order to achieve the target set for 2025 in residential and 
commercial building energy conservation, at least 7,000,000 more homes with renewable energy 
are required. In addition, consumers have been expecting high-tech development to bring more 
user-friendly and convenient applications and services, and this has not been met.  This led to 
the issues of Smart Living Spaces, including the emerging applications and services of Wireless 
Sensor Networks (WSN) and Ubiquitous Network Society (UNS). 
    Through UNS, the user can acquire personal services easily from various environments 
such as office, home, public space, or transport facilities, by using computers, mobile phones, 
home servers and other electronic equipments. At present, countries all over the world are 
developing application services in numerous directions. Taiwan can take a page out of the two 
neighboring countries of Japan and South Korea. The Japanese government in 2004 proposed the 
"U-Japan" concept in order to achieve UNS. It further launched the "xICT" policy in 2008, 
featuring industry and region as two new ingredients in response to the global trend, while 
keeping the framework of "U-Japan".  The South Korean government also launched in 2004 the 
"U-Korea" strategy and its precursor "IT839", to use UNS technology as the core to form 8 
Digital Services, 3 Infrastructures and 9 growth power industries. It is clear that UNS application 
services have become a key developing strategy in Japan and South Korea. 
 
1.2 Research background and Motivation 
 
    The main subject of this study is the Smart Kitchen, we would like to stress that, besides the 
basis function of a kitchen, high-tech hardware and software should be applied to the Smart 
Kitchen to meet the users’ demands, convenience and comfort. The basic functions of the kitchen 
include: cooking, drinking water, cleaning, and storage and so on, and a space for family 
members to chat and communicate. Therefore, the kitchen space in a family home plays a rather 
important role, and all family members are users for this space. The kitchen/dining room is a 
space that the whole family must use every day.  Past research indicated that, the kitchen is a 
relatively hazardous place in home for the senior, juvenile, or handicapped members of the 
family.  This has an impact on the frequency and duration for these members to use the kitchen.  
Therefore, an energy saving, safe, comfortable, convenient and healthy kitchen environment is a 
top priority in home design. 
    In addition, the gender of family members is also a factor in the frequency and duration of 
using the kitchen. According to the DGBAS survey in 2004, 31.3% of men in Taiwan 
participated in domestic chores.  This rate is much lower than that of France and the United

conducted a questionnaire survey to explore consumer’s cognition of Kitchen functions, to 
analyze their unmet needs in the kitchen, to pinpoint elements for better designs. Secondly, we 
differentiate the expectations of the Smart Kitchen from different family members, and divide 
the consumers into different "consumer groups" based on the types of families, to serve as a 
reference for market segmentation of the Smart Kitchen.  Finally, we studied the extent of 
user’s needs of the Smart Kitchen, and we hope that our quantified questionnaires and analysis 
will be useful for designers for their subsequent designs.  More specifically, the purposes of this 
study are as the following: 
 
    1. Analysis of the kitchen users' expectation and knowledge regarding the Smart Kitchen, 
its functions and equipments.  Find out the unsatisfied demands and the conditions for a 
kitchen-centered quality home environment. 
    2. Analysis of the differences in perceptions of importance and necessity of the Smart 
Kitchen equipments and functions among family members, in particular, the safety requirements 
for handicapped, seniors and children, and the demand of female users, who will use the kitchen 
most frequently. The cross analysis will be a useful reference for future designs. 
    3. Dividing the consumers into groups according to family types, and analyzing the 
differences in their priorities regarding kitchen equipments and functions, for applications to 
meet the essence of market segmentation. 
    4. Analysis of the kitchen users' acceptance of technology products for the Smart Kitchen 
equipments and functions and its relevance to their demands. 
 
1.4 Research questions 
 
    As mentioned above, this study intended to integrate the literature on consumers' demands 
on the Smart Kitchen equipments and functions, and made further empirical research. We hope 
to gain more insight into the dependency on family types and family members. 
    In marketing theory, the decision-makers usually make different marketing strategies based 
on different groups of consumers, target customer’s characteristics and demands.  The designers, 
however, often consider from the viewpoints of users and design to meet the needs.  Therefore, 
in this study, to realize a Smart-Kitchen centered design in a quality living environment, we first 
analyze the need of the users. Therefore, we propose to explore the following questions: 
 
1. What is the impact of family types and family members on the perception of significance 
and necessity of the Smart Kitchen features? 
2. Is the principal kitchen user's acceptance of technology a factor in their perception of 
importance and necessity of the Smart Kitchen features? 
 
II. Literature Review 
 
2.1 User’s demand and acceptance  
 
The word "demand" contains three different meanings: (Husen & Postlethwaife, 1985): 
First, a demand is a gap, which recognizes the inconsistency of the target and the reality, that is, 
the difference between target status and actual status.  Second: a demand is a want or a 
preference, the state of wanting or preferring, and in determining the demand we do not need to

June 23~June 26, 2010, Milano, Italy

characteristic and image varies with the environment. As the consumption happens in the 
adopting situation, the marketers must understand which situation their products belong to.  
Such information will enable the marketers to successfully sell their products to consumers in 
various situations. 
    Similarly, from the viewpoint of user’s behaviors, the adopting situation of a product also 
affects the user behavior, and the designer must understand the situation of his design. This 
information can bring his design closer to the user's life, and even make the users prefer his 
design. In other words, the key to satisfy a user is to provide the designer with the user's desired 
function in the relevant situation, so that the need can be met. 
    It is worth mentioning the concept of "User-Centered Design" (UCD), in which the product 
design is centered on users and this helps the designer to perceive and analyze the users' need.  
By analyzing the users' objectives and activities, mode and environment of operation, the 
designer can repeatedly redesign and test the products.  Simply put, UCD emphasizes meeting 
the users' expectation, and produce product of their hearts' desire.  
 
2.3 User's demand and interactive design 
 
    The object of this study, the Smart Kitchen, also stresses an interactive system design. The 
ISO 9241-10 gave the principles of interaction design and pointed out that the interaction 
between a user and an interactive device should be in accordance with software ergonomics, and 
meet the seven principles for evaluations and applications: task adequacy, operability, 
consistency, fault tolerance, self-describability, personalization, easy to learn.  Moreover, Oviatt 
(Oviatt 1997) also mentioned in his study of multi-modal interaction that the four principles of 
interactive designs are: transparent, flexible, efficient, and expressive powerfully.  A designer 
can use these principles to make UCD. 
    In this study, we used questionnaire to survey the user’s cognition, needs, and expectations. 
For example, we designed a questionnaire to understand the users' demand and acceptance of the 
Smart Refrigerator, its storage, health message, purchasing guides, recipes, and video/audio 
functions. We analyze the user's expectation and knowledge of the Smart Refrigerator. We also 
study whether the users understand that a Smart dining chair can adjust its functions according to 
the human body, the functions of a desktop living assistant, whether interactive games are 
interesting, whether the Smart Kitchen improve the family life.  In addition, we also try to 
understand whether the users know about the interactive view windows in a kitchen, the security 
alerts, the energy-efficient lighting designs and whether they meet user's need in security, 
environment protection, and comfort in a Smart Kitchen.  By constructing and better quality 
Kitchen, we can improve the living quality. 
         
2.4 Gender, family type and family members and the demand in the kitchen use 
 
    According to past research, the family type in a home has an impact on the gender division 
of labor. For example, women in a nuclear family are usually career women, and the main person 
doing household chores. But in an extended family, these tasks may be divided between a 
mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law. She also noticed that eating-out is a common practice now. 
A young couple in 1999 was more likely to eat out than one in 1970, even after marriage. In 
1999, a young husband is less likely to subject to the traditional view of genders, and less likely 
to regard cooking as the task of a wife.  He may participate in cooking himself. Thus we see

understand the following three topics: 1. the interviewees’ expectation toward the Smart Kitchen 
in terms of different family styles; 2. the usage and suggestions of kitchen space provided by the 
interviewees; 3. the suggestions about the Smart Kitchen’s functions. 
During the process, the interview started right after the researcher introduced the 
background of the research, objective and the interviewees’ background. In the first stage, for the 
interviewees’ were with high homogeneity, they had intensive discussion and interaction. The 
contents were focused on the problems or experiences they had ever confronted with when using 
kitchens at home. The process was digitally recorded and transcribed after finishing the interview. 
And we then conducted content analysis to induct all different attributes and dimensions. The 
results were finally analyzed. 
 
3.2 Quantitative questionnaire survey 
  
1. Subjects 
    We used Directorate General of Budget's "2007 overview of computer applications". It 
showed the popularity of family computers and home internet. We saw that currently internet is 
more popular in the five metropolitan regions and two sub-metropolitan regions.  Therefore, we 
set the targets of this study to be people meeting the following conditions: (1) the main users of 
the kitchen at home; (2) his/her home should have IT equipments (computers and network); (3) 
he/she lives in the five metropolitan regions or the two sub-metropolitan regions. 
 
2. Design of questionnaire 
    In our questionnaire, each question is formed after Likert's scale 5 point scale, "1" for 
strongly disagreeing, and “5" for strongly agreeing. We now describe the content design of the 
questionnaire. 
 
(1). Importance: we designed a total of 36 questions to measure the subjects' view of the 
importance of the Smart Kitchen:  11 questions on safety features, 7 on health 
function, 6 on energy-saving features, 6 on convenience, and 6 on comfort features.

disposer so that they could save time and energy on doing house work. 
    Secondly, they hoped that the Smart Kitchen could also be melted with the factor of “space” 
and combine the element of “communication and interaction”. When they come home to cook, 
it’s also the time for kids to do home work after school. If the spatial layout is well designed, 
they’ll be able to interact with their kids when working in the kitchen. 
 
4.3 Male users hoped that the circulation of the kitchen could be well designed, it’s easy to 
get utensils and the kitchen should be with the function of entertainment 
 
    Males cook generously and speedily, so they hoped that the circulation of the kitchen should 
be fluent. The receiving function and spatial layout should be taken into consideration when 
designing; condiments should be easy to get and utensils could be fast reached. Additionally, for 
single male users, kitchen should be with more entertaining functions, such as liquor cabinet, 
counter and dart, so that they could enjoy living when cooking. Cooking would thus be a pleased 
enjoyment.   
 
4.4 Kitchen appliances practitioners: Designed kitchen appliances have been highly 
advanced with the times, however, in Taiwan; the smart home electronic appliances are still 
hard to be delighted by the consumers 
 
   The kitchen appliances practitioners specially pointed out that with the revolution of the 
times; kitchen has been the core of family life, i.e., the concept of “kitchen is living room” has 
been accepted. Kitchen should be clean and tidy, and storage and receiving should be the 
important points when designing the kitchen, so that the family members would like to get close 
to it. Meanwhile, kitchen should be where for family to dine, interact and have a meeting with 
good friends and family members. Therefore, in modern society, kitchen is a good place for 
social interaction. Moreover, the kitchen appliances should not be so solid and cold; they should 
be integrated with the concept of humanity and art. 
    In addition, the practitioners of Taiwan have developed some advanced cooking appliances 
such as gruel cooker, which also makes smoothie and yeast bread dough. However, the domestic 
consumers seldom bought it, the product is mainly for exporting to the west, it is deeply 
delighted by the western consumers. 
 
V. Statistical analysis  
 
5.1 Analysis of personal background information 
 
We analyzed the 1001 valid samples according to their personal background information 
One can see that the female (810 persons, 80.9%) far outnumbered the male (191 persons, 
19.1%), 446 persons (44.6%) have 2 children or less, and 335 persons (33.5%) are single. 870 
(86.9%) of the respondents have a high school diploma or higher, and 67.6% of them go online 
one hour or more everyday. 53.7% of them prepare a meal daily, or less frequently.  506 (50.5%) 
of them belong to a core family, 119 (11.9%) to a 3-generation family (among these, 83.6% are 
second generation members in the family).  200 respondents (20.0%) have a child of age 6 or 
less, 358 (35.8%) of them have a child of age 6-18, and 350 (35%) of them have a child older 
than 18. Moreover, 192 (35%) of them have a family member of age 65 or older, and 48 (4.8%)

5.3 Importance-Demand Analysis 
 
The Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) framework was introduced by Martilla and 
James(1977) in marketing research in order to assist in understanding customer satisfaction as a 
function of both expectations concerning the significant attributes and judgments about their 
performance. Analyzed individually, importance and performance data may not be as meaningful 
as when both data sets are studied simultaneously (Graf, Hemmasi, & Nielsen, 1992). Hence, 
importance and performance data are plotted on a two dimensional grid with importance on the 
y-axis and performance on the x-axis. The data are then mapped into four quadrants (Bacon,

Figure 2  Health function 
 
Results of figure 2 indicate: 
1. Functions of providing dietary suggestions based on different situations or diseases through 
computer nutrition system and usable memo system for the aged people in the home are located 
in the 2nd quadrant, it implies that the respondents think the functions are both important and 
necessary. Designers need to regard them as important referential factors. 
2. Function of informing abnormal temperature of the refrigerator through phone call or mobile 
phone message is located in the 1st quadrant, it represents that the function is necessary but not 
so important. Accordingly, the function is the critical factor for the Smart Kitchen’s future 
development; designers should improve the shortcomings of the function to increase the 
product’s importance.

members through the interacting screen of the kitchen are located in the third quadrant, this 
indicates that the respondents think the factors are less important and not so necessary, so 
the designers should regard them as important indicators to improve the quality and increase 
the product’s value in the future. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5 Comfort function 
 
From figure 5, we can find: 
1. Functions of dinning chair’s automatic homing function for user’s convenience, and detecting 
the user’s figure and adjust to the most comfortable position of the wisdom dinning chair are 
located in the 2nd quadrant, it indicates that the respondents think the factors are both 
important and necessary, so the designers can regard them as important indicators when 
designing. 
2. Functions of automatically indicating the user’s e-mail through the wisdom dinning table, the 
entertaining function of the wisdom dinning table, the typesetting function of the wisdom 
dinning table, and the interacting, remote information exchanging and game playing function 
of the wisdom dinning table are located in the third quadrant, it reports that the respondents 
think the factors are less important and not so necessary, so the designers may improve them 
to increase the product’s function and value in the future. 
 
5.4 Discussion 
  The study employed independent sample T statistical test to examine if there exists significant 
difference of the average scores between the samples’ demographics (include: gender, 
occupation, hours of internet, family type, number of children aged under 6, and number of 
adults aged above 65) and technology acceptance. The results of table 3 showed some interesting 
issues listed as the following:

VI. Conclusion 
 
This chapter is going to make a conclusion based on the results of chapter 4 and 5 with the 
attempt to help the designer to understand the main user’s demand of the Smart Kitchen as well 
as remind the future designer to realize that both the opinion of the main user and other members 
of the family should be considered as an important factor when designing the system. Further 
research directions and suggestions are provided for future researchers finally. 
  
The difference of kitchen usage between housewives and career women could be the 
reference of market segmentation and the base of making marketing strategy. Under the lifestyle 
of modern business society, people are always busy, family members need time and space to 
interact, and kitchen is therefore the place for dining and parent-kid’s interaction and 
communication. Hence, spatial layout is one of the points to design the Smart Kitchen. Notably, 
safety remains the most urgent needs when designing the Smart Kitchen based on the 
suggestions provided by the users. In a housing space, an interactive monitor is necessary 
because females also hope to take good care of kids when they are working in the kitchen. 
 
The objective of the research is to explore the main user’s extent on the Smart Kitchen’s 
importance and demand. The respondents of the questionnaire mainly come from the five 
metropolitan and two sub-metropolitan areas that equipped with computer and internet 
facilitation in Taiwan. The results are analyzed by independent sample t-test and are explained as 
the following: 
The extent of importance and demand of the Smart Kitchen in terms of the main user: The 
results indicated that the importance and extent of demand on functions and equipments of the 
Smart Kitchen is positively pair wised correlated. Those who regard the functions and 
equipments of the Smart Kitchen as important factors have higher demands.  
 
The extent of importance and demand of the Smart Kitchen in terms of the main user: The 
results showed that in safety dimension, the respondents think the factors (such as gas and 
electricity) are both important and necessary; in health dimension, the respondents think the 
functions (for example: computer nutrition system and usable memo system) are both important 
and necessary; in energy-saving dimension, the respondents think the factors (like monitoring the 
electric appliances’ situation through computer or mobile phone, informing that the refrigerator’s 
door is not tightly closed through computer or mobile phone) are both important and necessary; 
in convenience dimension, the respondents think that the factors (such as: dialing out and 
answering the phone through the interacting screen of the kitchen, and communicating with the 
visitors and opening the door through the interacting screen of the kitchen) are both important 
and necessary; in comfort dimension, the respondents think the factors (for example: dinning 
chair’s automatic homing function for user’s convenience, and detecting the user’s figure and 
adjust to the most comfortable position of the wisdom dinning chair) are both important and 
necessary. The above stated functions could be designer’s important factors when designing the 
system.  
The factor’s ranking of the main user’s attitude toward the function and demand of the 
Smart Kitchen is as the following: safety (average score: 4.12); energy-saving (average score: 
3.38); health (average score: 3.34); convenience (average score: 3.31); comfort (average score: 
3.02). The cooking activities need to utilize electricity and gas, so the users regard safety as the
