微電子工業目前以銲接的方式，將電子零件連接到印刷電路板上(Printed Circuit Board, 
PCB)，而Ni/Sn/Cu為球矩陣式封裝(Ball Grid Arroy, BGA)及覆晶製程中最常見的結構。此
外，銲點與基材進行銲接時，銲料會與基材上的金屬發生化學反應，進而在界面生成一或
多種介金屬，這些介金屬對銲點的可靠度影響甚鉅。因此，欲提升銲點可靠度，必須了解
銲點與基材間的界面反應，而Cu、Ni為目前最常見與銲料接觸的金屬。文獻中以存在相當
多銲料與Cu及銲料與Ni之單一界面之反應結果，然而銲點在實際應用時常常是同時與Cu及
Ni進行銲接。因此本計畫主要著重於探討Ni/solder /Cu內Cu 與Ni 間的交互擴散，以完整的
了解Cu 與Ni 的擴散行為，並且與文獻中銲料與Cu及銲料與Ni之單邊反應做比較。

3、前言 
由本實驗室執行上一期之國科會計畫的成果得知[1-5]，當Cu 濃度較高(大於等於0.6 
wt.%)，則在界面僅會形成連續之(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 介金屬層。但若Cu 濃度較低(0.4 ~ 0.5 wt.%)
則界面上除有(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 生成外，(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 亦會開始生成。在此一 0.4 ~0.5 wt%的
範圍內，若銲料之Cu 濃度不斷的降低，則界面上 (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 的量亦會持續的遞減，而
(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 的量同時會持續的增加。當銲料之Cu 濃度降低至0.4 wt.%以下時，則
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 不再生成，僅有(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 生成在界面。當採用的銲料不含Cu 時(SnAg 銲
料)，則銲料內當然也不會有Cu6Sn5 的存在。在界面上，此時則僅會生成單一之Ni3Sn4 層，
如圖一所示。換句話說，隨著銲料之Cu 濃度的降低，介金屬將由原先的(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 層，
逐漸轉變為 (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 與 (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 共存。若Cu 的濃度更低時，則介金屬將全數
轉變為 (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4。亦即銲料內之Cu 濃度的高低，將可直接影響介金屬的種類與生長
形態。 
由以上討論得知，Cu 濃度對SnAgCu（或SnCu，SnAg）與Ni 之反應有很大的影響。
令人好奇的是Ni 在SnAgCu 中的濃度是否會影響SnAgCu 與Cu 之反應？由本實驗室過去
成果[6]及文獻中之資料[7]，可以得知：添加微量的Ni (0%、0.1%、0.5%、1.0%)不會改變
SnAgCu 與Cu 基板反應生成的介金屬生成的種類，而一直會是(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5。但是
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 的形狀及其厚度卻會因為溶Ni 量的不同而不同。總而言之，不同Cu 濃度的
銲料與Ni 銲接，會生成不同種類介金屬；而不同Ni濃度的銲料與Cu 銲接，雖然會產生同
一種的介金屬，但是其微結構卻不同。亦即，微量的Cu 或Ni 濃度的改變，會改變SnAgCu 
與Ni 或Cu 反應生成物的種類或微結構。本研究計畫主要的目的是探討在實際的銲點中，
此一濃度效應是否會對銲點造成影響。 
此外，由文獻可知當銲點一端與Cu 進行銲接，另一端與Ni 進行銲接時，銲點兩端會
進行的交互作用[8-11]。本研究計畫之主要目的即是深入探討銲點兩端界面間的交互作用。
本計畫將著重於探討Ni / solder / Cu 內Cu 與Ni 間的交互擴散，以完整的了解Cu 與Ni 的
擴散行為。在第一年我們計畫探討在Ni /solder / Cu 擴散偶的結構下，不同厚度的銲料在經
過迴銲後兩個界面之交互作用。第二年計畫則探討在Ni /solder / Cu 擴散偶的結構下，不同
厚度的銲料在經過長時間高溫熱處理後兩個界面之交互作用。而最後ㄧ年計畫則探討在
Cu/solder/Au 擴散偶的結構下，在經過長時間高溫熱處理後兩個界面之交互作用。 
 
4、實驗方法 
本研究使用厚度 400 μm 的銅片（純鍍99.98 %），在電鍍前先拋光至1 μm、5% HNO3
微蝕與去離子水清洗，使銅的表面平整與去除氧化物。接著把銅片置於自製電鍍槽中，使
用掛鍍方式在銅片上電鍍100、200、400 μm 的錫，再以相同的方法繼續在其上鍍上7 μm
厚度的Au。試片結構圖如圖二所示。 
將試片切成8mm*4mm 裝在樣本瓶（φ12 mm size），置於溫度設為160℃的烘箱中，
反應時間由0 到1000hr，反應完成後，馬上吹風使試片溫度迅速回到室溫停止反應，即完
濃度的增加，有機會轉變成(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5，由相圖判斷(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5組成為Cu：40 at. %，
Au：15 at.%， Sn：45 at. %，若此相圖為EDS所測得，此與EPMA 數據結果有些許誤差，
短時間的結果是可以接受的。 
Cu擴散經由Cu3Sn、Cu6Sn5及Sn在AuSn4與Sn中間生成(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5，如圖五，利用
OPTIMAS軟體求得(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5的面積，除上擴散的長度L，得到平均的(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5厚
度d，隨時間增加(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5厚度d也會跟著增加。 
(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5厚度對反應時間的二分之一次方作圖，圖六，由圖中可以看出反應較符
合拋物線關係，即為擴散控制。 
我們利用AuSn4 與Sn的介面生成(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5 計算Cu經由Cu3Sn、Cu6Sn5 及Sn的通
量，由質量平衡我們可以得到下列式子 
WIMC*Cu [wt. %] =Jave*A*t                 （1） 
此WIMC 為(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5 重量，Cu [wt. %]為Cu的重量百分比，Jave為平均通量，A 為
通過單位面積，t為時間。而WIMC=V*DIMC，V=A*d，DIMC為(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5介金屬密度，此
用Cu6Sn5的密度為7.9（g/cm3），V為(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5 介金屬體積，d為厚度。整理（1）可得
（2）式 
Jave=d*DIMC*Cu wt.%/t                  （2） 
再經過單位換算，乘上Avogadro’s number，除上分子量，即可得每單位面積平均通過
Cu原子數。我們把圖六的數據，作出一條符合它的拋物線，d=0.3t1/2[μm]，經單位換算，
帶入下式（3） 
t
dwtCuDJ IMC 
 *.%][*                  （3） 
如此可得到每單位面積瞬間通過Cu原子數，圖七所示。 
 
6、結論 
在200℃下，銅可以在四分鐘內在錫中擴散100μm，而金也可擴散將近80μm。熱處理
至80分鐘，7μm Au會與錫完全反應。在錫中可以找到AuSn4 及Cu6Sn5的介金屬，在AuSn4
與Sn 的介面會生成(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5，(CuxAu1-x)6Sn5的生成為擴散控制。剛開始反應10分鐘瞬
間銅擴散的通量為2*1018 (atom/cm2 sec)，反應至24小時瞬間銅擴散的通量為1.71*1017 
(atom/cm2 sec)，亦即通量會隨時間增加而減少。

and 1c that the spalling occurred across the entire joint.
More intriguing micrographs showing the massive spalling
can be found in the articles by Ho et al.3,4
To understand the occurrence of massive spalling even
in the presence of an intact wettable Ni layer, one has to start
from the phase equilibrium of the relevant elements. The
Sn-rich corner of the Sn-Cu-Ni isotherm at 240 °C is shown
in Fig. 1d.4 The constituent Ag is inert as far as the inter-
facial reaction is concerned and can be ignored in the present
analysis.10,11 This isotherm shows that solders with different
Cu concentration are in equilibrium with different phases.
When the Cu concentration is high between a and b, the
molten solder is in equilibrium with Cu1−xNix6Sn5, and
when the Cu concentration is low between b and c, the
molten solder is in equilibrium with Ni1−yCuy3Sn4. At point
b, the molten solder, Ni1−yCuy3Sn4, and Ni1−yCuy3Sn4 are
in three-phase equilibrium. According to this isotherm, one
might anticipate that the reaction between Ni and the molten
solder with different Cu concentrations would produce dif-
ferent compounds at the interface. This strong Cu concentra-
tion dependency indeed had been observed experimentally in
the reaction between SnCu solder and Ni,12 as well as be-
tween SnAgCu and Ni.10,11 It was found that, upon increas-
ing the Cu concentration, the reaction product changed from
single-phase Ni1−yCuy3Sn4, to two-phase Ni1−yCuy3Sn4
+ Cu1−xNix6Sn5, and then to single-phase
Cu1−xNix6Sn5.10–12 As Cu1−xNix6Sn5 or Ni1−yCuy3Sn4
grew thicker, more and more Cu atoms in the solder were
extracted out of the solder and became incorporated into
Cu1−xNix6Sn5, or Ni1−yCuy3Sn4. Consequently, if the Cu
concentration of the solder is not maintained at a constant
level by certain means, the Cu concentration of solder will
decrease with the growth of the reaction products. In the
studies reporting the Cu concentration effect,10–12 the amount
of solders used was quite large, and therefore the Cu concen-
tration of the solders could be regarded as constant. How-
ever, real solder joints are quite small. For example, current
ball-grid-array solder joints can be as small as 300 m in
diameter, and flip-chip solder joints are in the 100 m range.
The small joint size, compounded by the fact that the Cu
concentration in solders is usually very low typically
1 wt. %, leads to the fact that the total amount of Cu in
real solder joints is very limited. As a result, the Cu concen-
tration in solder can markedly decrease as the reaction prod-
ucts at the interface grow. Ignoring those Cu atoms in
Ni1−yCuy3Sn4 on the grounds that the thickness of this com-
pound is relatively thin and that its Cu concentration is low
compared to that of Cu1−xNix6Sn5, one can obtain the fol-
lowing equation, relating the drop of the Cu concentration to
the thickness of Cu1−xNix6Sn5 at the interface:3
wCu − wCu
0 wt . %  − 40 dpad2djoint3 Cu0.60Ni0.406Sn5, 1
where wCu
0 and wCu represent the Cu concentrations wt. %
in solder before and after the soldering, respectively. The
symbols djoint and dpad represent the diameters of the solder
joint and the diameter of soldering pad’s opening in microns,
respectively. The symbol Cu0.60Ni0.406Sn5 is the thickness in
microns of Cu0.60Ni0.406Sn5 at the interface. This specific
Cu0.60Ni0.406Sn5 composition is used because it is the
composition observed by many researchers under similar
situations.
After a typical reflow, the thickness of Cu0.60Ni0.406Sn5
becomes about 1–2 m.4 The drop in Cu concentration for
smaller solder joints can be quite substantial according to Eq.
1. For example, if 2 m of Cu0.60Ni0.406Sn5 forms in the
100 m/85 m ball/pad combination, the Cu concentration
will drop by as large as 0.58 wt. %. Under such a condition,
the remaining Cu concentration in the solder will approach
zero because most of the popular commercial SnAgCu sol-
ders have Cu concentration less than 0.7 wt. %. Conse-
quently, the phase equilibrium at the interface changes from
the Cu1−xNix6Sn5+L two-phase region to the
Ni1−yCuy3Sn4+L two-phase region, and there will be a
driving force for Cu1−xNix6Sn5 to leave the interface in or-
der to form a more stable Ni1−yCuy3Sn4.
To test this theory, three different sizes of Sn3Ag0.6Cu
solder balls, 760, 500, and 300 m, were planted onto
375 m Ni soldering pads, and reflowed at 235 °C for 20
min. As shown in Fig. 2, the Cu1−xNix6Sn5 thickness after
reflow was 2.3, 1.7, and 1.6 m for 760, 500, and 300 m
balls, respectively. The corresponding drop of Cu concentra-
tion according to Eq. 1 was 0.03, 0.08, and 0.33 wt. %,
respectively. In other words, the remaining Cu concentration
in the solder was 0.57, 0.52, and 0.27 wt. %, respectively.
Therefore, for the cases of 760 and 500 m balls, the equi-
librium at the interface remained in the Cu1−xNix6Sn5+L

librium phase now became Cu6Sn5 and this phase nucleated
between CuZn and Cu, and the spalling of CuZn occurred.
The analysis in this section can be extended to Zn-doped
SnAg, SnCu, and SnAgCu solders, because Zn is the most
reactive constituent in these solders. If the Zn doping is high
enough, say, higher than about 0.7 wt. %, the initial com-
pound at the interface will be Sn-Zn based compounds. Nev-
ertheless, if the Zn concentration is very low, Cu-based in-
termetallic compounds Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn would be the
dominant phases at the interface. Recently, it was reported
that, in the SnAgCu/Cu reaction, minor Zn addition into the
solder was an effective method for reducing the growth rate
of Cu3Sn, which was responsible for the formation of detri-
mental Kirkendall’s voids.14 When doping Zn to these sol-
ders to avoid the formation of excessive Kirkendall’s voids,
one must be careful not to exceed a certain maximum level,
or massive spalling might occur. We estimate that this maxi-
mum level is about 0.7 wt. % Zn. However, more studies are
needed to obtain a more precise value.
C. Massive spalling in Pb5Sn/Cu
High Pb solders, such as Pb5Sn, are exempt from the EU
RoHS requirements for flip-chip applications, and are ex-
pected to be used in this area for an extended period of time
in the future. Recently, it was reported that massive spalling
could also occur in the Pb5Sn/Cu system.7,8 As will be
shown below, the Pb5Sn/Cu system indeed exhibits the two
necessary conditions for massive spalling pointed out in Sec.
II A. One apparent difference is that, unlike SnAgCu/Ni and
SnZn/Cu, where spalling occurred in the reflow stage when
the solder were molten, spalling in Pb5Sn/Cu occurred in the
aging stage when the solder was in the solid state. The reason
for the occurrence of massive spalling in the solid state will
be given below.
It is well known that only Cu3Sn forms when high-lead
PbSn solder is reacted with Cu.15,16 In the study of Jang et
al.,7 the Cu3Sn layer formed during reflow, and adhered well
to the interface after reflow. Spalling of Cu3Sn was not ob-
served after 200 h of solid-state aging at 170 °C, and only
after 500 h of aging could spalling of Cu3Sn be observed.7
Shown in Fig. 4a is the microstructure of spalling after
solid-state reaction at 170 °C for 1000 h.7 Jang et al. pointed
out that spalling occurred because Sn near the interface had
been consumed locally, and the diffusion of Sn in the solder
was so slow that those Sn atoms far away from the interface
could not diffuse back to the interface fast enough to keep
the Sn concentration up. According to the Pb-Sn-Cu isotherm
shown in Fig. 4b, the local equilibrium at the interface
changes from the Cu6Sn5+ Pb two-phase field, to the
Cu3Sn+Pb two-phase field, then to the CuPb two-
phase field with decreasing Sn concentration. Therefore,
spalling was again caused by the depletion of the most reac-
tive constituent Sn in the present case in the solder, al-
though here the depletion occurred only locally near the in-
terface. In fact, it had been shown in a follow-up study8 that
spalling would not occur in Pb10Sn/Cu diffusion couples
subjected to the same treatment because the supply of Sn
was more abundant.
The reason that spalling did not occur in the reflow stage
was twofold. The number one reason was that the formation
of Cu3Sn consumed relatively less Sn because the Cu/Sn
atomic ratio in Cu3Sn is 3:1. The formation of the Cu3Sn
layer did not significantly reduce the total amount of the
available Sn atoms in Pb5Sn. The second reason is that Sn
diffusion in the molten solder was much faster so that the Sn
concentration near the interface never dropped below the
level where Cu3Sn was no longer in equilibrium with the
molten solder. Only in the solid state could the local Sn
concentration near the interface drop below the level leading
to mass spalling.
D. Massive spalling in Pb5Sn/Ni
The Pb5Sn/Ni also exhibits the two necessary conditions
for massive spalling, and massive spalling was indeed ob-
served in this system.9 Figure 5a shows the massive spal-
ling of Ni3Sn4 after reaction at 350 °C for 90 min,9 and Fig.
5b shows the 250 °C Pb-Sn-Ni isotherm calculated by
Ghosh.17 The Pb-Sn-Ni isotherm at 350 °C is not available,
but the 250 °C isotherm should give a reasonable approxi-
mation of the geometry of the phase relationships. Figure
5b shows that the equilibrium phase with Pb changes
from Ni3Sn4 to Ni3Sn2, and then to Ni3Sn, upon decreasing
the Sn concentration. Therefore, as more and more Sn atoms
were incorporated into the growing Ni3Sn4, the Sn concen-

different. This difference in thermal history could in
turn result in different extents of the chemical reaction,
and possibly different solidification microstructures if
both types of joints become molten during soldering.
This effect is just one of many reasons why electronic
soldering is becoming an ever more challenging
technology.
Those regions on the surface of a chip that are to be
in direct contact with the solders are the so-called un-
der bump metallurgy (UBM) regions. Copper is the
most popular choice for the surface layer of the UBM,
mainly due to its good wetting property with solders [2,
3]. In Fig. 1, Cu is selected for illustration as the sur-
face layer of the UBM, and the Ni layer beneath serves
as the diffusion barrier layer. During assembly or
normal service of the device, the Cu layer will be
consumed completely, exposing the Ni layer to the
solder. Those regions on the BGA and PCB substrates
that are to be in contact with solders are known as the
soldering pads, and the base metal of the soldering
pads is always Cu with a few rare exceptions. The Cu
base metal on the soldering pads of the BGA and PCB
substrates has to be coated with a surface finish (or
final finish) to preserve the wetting property during the
storage period before assembly. Popular surface fin-
ishes include Au/Ni, immersion Sn, immersion Ag, and
organic surface preservative (OSP). In the case of Au/
Ni, the Au layer will be dissolved into the solder
rapidly during soldering [4–15], exposing the Ni layer
below. In the cases of the other three surface finishes,
Sn, Ag, or OSP will be dissolved into the solder
(immersion Sn and immersion Ag) or be displaced
from the interface (OSP) during soldering, leaving the
Cu layer exposed to the solder. In Fig. 1, Au/Ni is used
as the surface finish for the BGA substrate, and OSP
for the PCB substrate. Summarizing all the popular
material choices for the UBM and the surface finishes,
one can expect that the most common material
sequences across a post-assembly solder joints are, Cu/
solder/Cu, Cu/solder/Ni, and Ni/solder/Ni. The Ni layer
here can be deposited by electroplating, electroless
plating, or sputtering. In the electroless process, a few
atomic percents of P are often co-deposited with Ni,
and the Ni layer is customarily labeled as Ni(P). In the
sputtering process, V is often added to the sputtering
target to ease off the Ni magnetic effect to enhance the
deposition rate, resulting in the co-deposition of one or
two atomic percents of V into the Ni layer. This type of
Ni layer is customarily labeled as Ni(V), or simply NiV.
The presence of P or V in the Ni layer do complicate
the chemical interactions between Ni and solders
[16–38], but these reactions still share enough common
features to allow a discussion of them together in this
paper.
Several good review articles for electronic solders
have been published in the past few years [3, 11, 29, 39–
44]. The intention here is not to duplicate their efforts.
The focus of this paper is to review and to present
original data on three key issues related to the inter-
facial reactions between common lead-free solders and
Ni, Cu, or Ni + Cu. The first issue is about the effect of
Ni on the interfacial reactions between solders and Cu
(Sect. 2). Recently, the formation of Kirkendall voids
during the solders/Cu reactions had been observed.
These Kirkendall voids have been attributed to being
the root cause for joint fracture during the drop test.

the Cu3Sn thickness remained very thin even after
aging at 150C for 1,000 h [54]. As the growth of Cu3Sn
is the culprit for the formation of the Kirkendall voids,
the addition of Ni can therefore reduce the amount of
the Kirkendall voids. In fact, recently it had been
shown that the interfacial strength from drop test
indeed increase for solders joints with just a small
amount of Ni addition (< 1 wt.%) [56].
Figure 3 also shows that Ni addition increased the
amount of Cu6Sn5 at the interface compared to that
without Ni addition. In addition, the Cu6Sn5phase now
possessed a small amount of Ni, and became (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5. A close examination of Fig. 3(b) reveals that
there were two distinct (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 regions [54].
The inner region was a dense layer of (Cu0.98-
Ni0.02)6Sn5, and the outer region was actually
composed of an aggregate of (Cu0.89Ni0.11)6Sn5 parti-
cles. The compositions noted were carefully deter-
mined by using the electron probe microanalysis
(EPMA). The space between these (Cu0.89Ni0.11)6Sn5
particles was occupied by the solder. It was proposed
that the inner region formed during the solid-state
aging period, and the outer region was the remains of
the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 formed during the reflow period.
This proposition was supported by the micrographs for
the as-reflow samples shown in Fig. 4 [54]. It can
be seen that Ni addition induced a thicker layer of
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 during the reflow stage. During the
solid-state aging, the region of the aggregate near the
Cu side was converted into the dense (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
layer, and what was left of the aggregate showed up in
Fig. 3(b). The outer (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 region in Fig. 4(b)
apparently served as a short cut for Sn diffusion, that
enhanced the Cu6Sn5 growth but inhibited the growth
of Cu3Sn. Consequently, the un-desirable growth of
Cu3Sn was hindered. Another possibility for the
shrinkage of Cu3Sn could be attributed to the substi-
tution of Ni into the Cu sublattice of Cu–Sn com-
pound(s), to reduce the interdiffusion coefficient [56].
The observation that Ni addition could induce a
larger amount of (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 during reflow deserves
more attention. It is proposed that this phenomenon is
closely related to the Cu metastable solubility and the
Cu equilibrium solubility in the solder. Here, these two
types of solubility will be briefly discussed first. During
the reaction of Cu with molten solders, it is often
observed that in some regions bare Cu was in direct
contact with the molten solders without being covered

have Cu as a minor constituent (Table 1), and the
allowance for the concentration variation for each ele-
ment is typically ± 0.2 wt.%, a customary adoption of
the practice from the eutectic PbSn solder. As will be
shown below, this ± 0.2 wt.% difference can change the
compound formed at the interface after reflow.
3.1 Uncomplicated Cu concentration effect
During the reflow of SnCu or SnAgCu solders over
those soldering pads that have the Ni, Ni(P), and Ni(V)
underlayer, the reaction product(s) at the interface are
very sensitive to the Cu concentration in the solders.
After the first report [73] of this Cu sensitivity a few
years ago, over forty papers had been published on this
subject. As summarized in Table 2, the results of these
studies as a whole are quite consistent, even though
different reflow conditions and different Ni substrates,
including Ni, Ni(P), Ni(V), or Au/Ni, had been used.
As shown in Table 2, when the Cu concentration was
low (< 0.3 wt.%), only (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 formed at the
interface. When the Cu concentration increased to
0.4–0.5 wt.%, both (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
formed. When the Cu concentration increased above
0.5 wt.%, only (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 formed. In a few specific
cases [28, 86, 89–91, 96, 104, 105], where the reported
results seemed to differ from the trend shown in
Table 2 at the first sight, the inconsistency in fact could
be attributed to the so-called ‘‘solder volume effect,’’
which is to be discussed in the next section.
To exclude other factors that may obscure the dis-
cussion, the reaction between a large amount of solder
and a piece of thick, high purity Ni substrate will be
examined first. Since the amount of solder was large,
one can then assume that the solder composition
remained constant during the reaction even though Cu
was being extracting out of the solder to be incorpo-
rated into the reaction product(s). In addition, since
the Ni substrate was thick, the Ni substrate was never
totally consumed. In some aspects, the system
approached the limit of classical infinite/infinite diffu-
sion couple. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the reaction prod-
uct at the interface was a continuous layer of (Ni1-y
Cuy)3Sn4 when the Cu concentration was 0.2 wt.%.
When the Cu concentration increased to 0.4 wt.%,
discontinuous (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 particles began to form
over the (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 continuous layer, Fig. 7(b).
When the Cu concentration increased to 0.5 wt.%,
both (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 and (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 were continu-
ous, Fig. 7(c). When the Cu concentration reached
0.6 wt.%, only a continuous (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer was
present, Fig. 7(d). The crystal structures of the prod-
ucts had been verified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns shown in Fig. 8 [73, 106]. To obtain such

Cu6Sn5, and only this phase can be immediately next to
L, as shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d).
3.2 Solder volume effect during reaction
with molten solders (reflow)
During reflow and the subsequent aging, Cu atoms are
incorporated into the intermetallic(s) [i.e., (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5 and (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4] at the interface. As the
intermetallic(s) grow, more Cu atoms are being con-
sumed. The results presented in the previous section
were for the condition that the amount of the solder
was relatively large so that the supply of Cu was also
large. The average Cu concentration in the solder
could consequently remain nearly constant. The ther-
modynamic condition at the interface was thus static,
and the formation of one compound or another was
more or less dictated by the thermodynamics. For a
real solder joint in array–array packages, the supply of
Cu is actually very limited because the solder volume is
quite small in the first place, and secondly the
Cu concentration in SnAgCu solder is always less than
a few atomic percents (see Table 2). The Cu concen-
tration can decrease noticeably as the intermetallic(s)
grow [89–91]. As the Cu concentration changes,
the type of the equilibrium intermetallic at the inter-
face might also change. Now the condition at the

combinations ranging from the BGA to flip-chip
dimensions is plotted in Fig. 13. For example, if 2 lm
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5, which is the thickness commonly seen
in real solder joints, forms in the 100 lm/80 lm
combination, the Cu concentration will drop by as
large as 0.51 wt.%. Under such a condition, the resi-
due Cu concentration in solder will be less than
0.3 wt.% for most SnAgCu solder compositions listed
in Table 1. If the Cu concentration indeed become
less than 0.3 wt.%, then the Cu6Sn5/molten solder
interface is no longer thermodynamically stable

123
classical example, shown in Fig. 16, is the spalling of
Cu6Sn5 during the reaction of eutectic PbSn solder with
Au/Cu/Cu–Cr thin film [3, 116]. Spalling here was due
to the exhaustion of the Cu film, and the poor wetting
between Cu6Sn5 and the remaining Cr (or SiO2) caused
the compound to detach itself from the interface. The
‘‘massive spalling’ introduced in this section is not
caused by the exhaustion of a reaction layer. Instead, it
is caused by the consumption of one element inside the
reacting phase, as had been discussed in the previous
section. The shifting of the interfacial equilibrium
causes the product phase to separate itself from the
interface [89–91].
The massive spalling has a higher tendency to occur
in smaller joints because these joints will experience a
lager Cu concentration drop. Fig. 17 shows an example
of massive spalling in its early stage. The reflow con-
ditions were the same as those in Fig. 15, but dpad and
djoint were 175 and 200 lm, respectively. As can be
seen in Fig. 17, a new (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 layer had formed
over the Ni substrate, pushing the original (Cu1-x
Nix)6Sn5 layer away from the interface, and a gap had
appeared between these two layers. It should be
stressed again that even though the reflow conditions
were the same, such spalling did not occur for the
larger joints in Fig. 15(a) and (b). Longer reflow time
also favors the spalling, as shown in Fig. 18. Here, the
sample had the same configuration as that of Fig. 15(c),
but the reflow time was increased from 90 s to 20 min.
Longer reflow time had increased the separation
between (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 from a
series of voids in Fig. 15(c) to a gap in Fig. 18.
A very revealing example of the massive spalling is
shown in Fig. 19, where a djoint/dpad = 760 lm/600 lm
joint had been reflowed at 235C for 5 min. In this

the joint with the highest Cu concentration (0.7 wt.%),
shown in Fig. 20(g), the amount of Cu was still enough
to sustain a (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer over the (Ni1-y
Cuy)3Sn4, as shown in Fig. 20(g). But when the Cu
concentration became lower (0.5 and 0.3 wt.% Cu),
shown in Fig. 20(h) and (i), the amount of Cu was not
enough to sustain the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer, and only a
(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 layer was present. It should be noted
that in these two cases (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 did appear over
the (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 layer once during certain time
frame, but (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 eventually disappeared and
be converted into (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4. It can be anticipated
that the (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layer in Fig. 20(g) will also
disappear if this sample is subjected to longer aging.
From our recent study, the formation of both
(Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 layers at the
interface after aging has a negative impact on the
strength of the joints. The joints tend to fail along
the interface of these two compounds. This is
because both these two compounds are quite brittle,
and the interface between two brittle intermetallics
unfortunately tends to be weak, especially for two
compounds originate from two different binary sys-
tems. To avoid the formation of two compounds
simultaneously, both the Cu concentration effect and
the solder volume effect have to be taken into
account at the same time.
4 Cross-interaction between Cu and Ni across
a solder joint
In Sects. 2 and 3, the effect of Ni on the reaction
between Cu and solder and the effect of Cu on the
reaction between Ni and solder are discussed, respec-
tively. In this section, the interaction between Cu and
Ni across a solder joint will be considered. The
importance of such cross-interaction had been reported
in several publications available in the literature [53,
80, 117–120].
4.1 Cross-interaction during reaction with molten
solders (reflow)
To investigate the cross-interaction during the reflow
stage more carefully, the solder joints that were
assembled by two different paths are compared. As
illustrated in Fig. 21, in Path I, the solder (Sn3.5Ag)
was attached to the Cu substrate in the first reflow, and
then the Ni substrate was attached to the other side of
the solder joint in the second reflow. In path II, the
solder was attached to the Ni substrate first (the first
reflow), and in the second reflow Cu substrate was
attached to the other side of the solder joint.
Shown in Fig. 22 are the solder/Cu and Ni/solder
interfaces for Path I (left column) and path II (right

been soldered only once and consequently had no
cross-interaction during aging were shown in the left
column for comparison. In the middle column and the
right column, the corresponding interfaces for the Path
I and Path II after aging are shown, respectively. It can
be seen that Cu3Sn in Fig. 26(d) and (f) are thinner
than that in Fig. 26(b). This is due to the Ni effect
presented in Sect. 2.2. Moreover, Cu3Sn in Fig. 26(f) is
also thinner than that in Fig. 26(d). This is reasonable
because in Path II more Ni was dissolved because Ni in
Path II went through one more reflow than in Path I. In
addition, no Kirkendall void was observed in Fig. 26(d)
and (f) even by the means of FIB sample preparation.
It should also be pointed that the cross-interaction
accelerated the consumption rate of the Cu substrate
and reduced the consumption rate of the Ni substrate
[120]. The Ni consumption rate decreased because the
growth of (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 consumed a less amount of Ni
than did the growth of (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 [81, 107, 117,
120].
5 Summary
The addition of Ni to Sn, SnCu, SnAg, and SnAgCu in
amounts as minute as 0.1 wt.% is able to substantially
hinder the Cu3Sn growth in the reaction between these
solders and the Cu substrate. The growth of Cu3Sn
often accompanies the formation of Kirkendall voids,
which has been linked to the weakening of the solders
joints. Accordingly, Ni has been proposed as a useful
alloying additive to these solders.
Likewise, Cu has a strong effect on the reactions
between these solders and Ni-based substrates. When
the amount of solder is large so that the supply of Cu is
not an issue, the interfacial reaction is dictated by the
Cu–Ni–Sn phase equilibrium, and the types of the
reaction products formed depend on the Cu concen-
tration. Under such a condition, when the Cu concen-
tration is low (£0.3 wt.%), only (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 forms at
the interface. When the Cu concentration increases to
0.4–0.5 wt.%, both (Ni1-yCuy)3Sn4 and (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
form. When the Cu concentration increases above
0.5 wt.%, (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 forms. However, in BGA or
flip-chip solder joints, where the solder joints are small
and the Cu supply becomes limited, the solder volume
effect becomes important because the Cu concentra-
tion is no longer constant during the reaction. An
equation, Eq. 1, for the Cu concentration drop has
been derived as a function of the joint size and the
intermetallic compound thickness. As the Cu concen-
tration decreases, the equilibrium phase at the inter-
face may change, and the local thermodynamic
equilibrium at the interface is no longer static. The

reflow and aging. Moreover, the cross-interaction
between Cu and Ni in a Cu/solder/Ni structure has
been reported by Chen et al.10 It was found that the
cross-interaction did occur, and the uphill diffusion
of Cu was observed.10
In all of these previous studies, the solder joints
were assembled by reflow, which is a high temper-
ature process involving molten solder. Substantial
interactions occurred during the assembly process,
and therefore it was difficult to tell whether the
interactions occurred during the reflow stage or
during the aging stage. The objective of this paper is
to investigate the cross-interaction between Cu and
Ni across the solder joints by means of diffusion
couples that are prepared using the electroplating
process. The electroplating process is a low tem-
perature process so that one can be sure most of the
observed phenomena really occur in the aging stage.
This technique has the additional benefit of pro-
ducing variable Sn layer thickness. Using different
Sn layer thickness allows one to simulate solder
joints of various sizes.
EXPERIMENTAL
The Ni/Sn/Cu diffusion couples were prepared by
electroplating an Sn layer (100 lm or 400 lm) and
then a Ni layer (20 lm) on Cu foil substrates. Sim-
ilar preparation techniques have been described in
detail elsewhere.11,12 A schematic drawing of the
sample structure is shown in Fig. 2. After electro-
plating the Sn and Ni layers, the foil was cut into
4 mm · 8 mm diffusion couples. We also prepared
Sn/Cu and Ni/Sn diffusion couples as control
experiments. The diffusion couples were directly
subjected to aging at 160C without going through
the reflow step.
In addition, one of the Ni/Sn diffusion couple was
aged at 160C for 500 h to produce the structure
Ni/Ni3Sn4/Sn first, and then a layer of Cu was elec-
troplated over the Sn to produce a multi-layer
Ni/Ni3Sn4/Sn/Cu diffusion couple. Then this diffusion
couple was aged at 160C for an additional 100 h.
After aging, the diffusion couples were mounted
in epoxy and metallographically polished to reveal
the microstructure. The reaction zone for each
sample was examined by using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). Compositions of the intermetal-
lic compounds were determined by electron probe
micro-analysis (EPMA). In EPMA analysis, the
concentration of each element was measured inde-
pendently, and the total weight percentage of all
elements was within 100 ± 1% in each case. The
average value from at least three measurements
was then reported. The thickness of the reaction
product was defined as the total area occupied by
that phase divided by the linear length of the
interface. The total area occupied a particular phase
was measured by using an image analyzing
software.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The as-deposited Ni/(100 lm Sn)/Cu diffusion
couple is shown in Fig. 3. Even though the electro-
plating was performed at a relatively low tempera-
ture (60C), a very thin layer of intermetallic had
already formed at the Ni/Sn interface, as well as at
the Sn/Cu interface. These two product layers were
too thin to be positively identified by EPMA.
When the aging time reached 30 min, the reaction
products were thick enough for a more qualita-
tive identification. As shown in Fig. 4a, a layer of a
Ni-Sn-Cu ternary intermetallic, presumably
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5, existed at the original Ni/Sn inter-
face, and a layer of Cu6Sn5 existed at the original
Sn/Cu interface. We proposed that the Ni-Sn-Cu
ternary intermetallic was (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 based on
our earlier study.5 Results from the EPMA mea-
surements also showed that the composition of this
compound was (Cu0.6Ni0.4)6Sn5. No Ni was detected

between Cu and Ni in Ni/Sn/Cu. Before going into
the details of this cross-interaction, the effect of
increasing the distance between Ni and Cu, thus the
thickness of Sn in Ni/Sn/Cu, will be shown first.
Figure 7 shows the Ni/(400 lm Sn)/Cu diffusion
couple after aging at 160C for 1,000 h. Although
the Sn layer thickness had been increased by four
times, evidences for the cross-interaction are still
clearly visible. First of all, on the Ni side (Cu1-xNix)6
Sn5, instead of Ni3Sn4, was still the only compound
formed, as shown in Fig. 7a. On the Cu side, shown
in Fig. 7b, both (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 and Cu3Sn were
present as in the Ni/(100 lm Sn)/Cu case, but now
Cu3Sn was thinner than that in the binary Cu/Sn
couple (Fig. 6b), and thicker than that in the
Ni/(100 lm Sn)/Cu couple (Fig. 5b). The EPMA
measurements revealed that the compositions of
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 were also different for Ni/(100 lm
Sn)/Cu and Ni/(400 lm Sn)/Cu, as summarized in
Table I. On the Cu side, the Ni concentrations in
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 were very low in both cases, but
thicker Sn did have the effect of lowering the Ni
concentration by one half, from 0.8 at.% to 0.4 at.%.
On the Ni side, where Cu atoms had to diffuse from
the Cu side, the Cu concentrations of (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5
almost remained the same when the Sn thickness
increased from 100 lm to 400 lm. It seems that
when the Sn thickness increased, the faster diffu-
sion of Cu was affected to a smaller extent compared
to Ni, which diffused slower.
The growth kinetics of (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 on the Cu
and Ni side in both Ni/(100 lm Sn)/Cu and
Ni/(400 lm Sn)/Cu couples are shown in Fig. 8. The
four sets of data all seemed to follow the parabolic
kinetics. The (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 on the Cu side was
always thicker than that on the Ni side, but there

The thicknesses of Cu3Sn in different diffusion
couples that had been aged at 160C for 1,000 h are
shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that in general,
Cu3Sn in Ni/(100 lm Sn)/Cu was thinner than that
in Ni/(400 lm Sn)/Cu, which in turn was thinner
than that in Sn/Cu. This effect was caused by the Ni
effect on the Sn/Cu reaction.8 It has been reported
that Ni-doped Sn-bared solders can reduce the
Cu3Sn growth rate in the Sn/Cu reaction.
8 When the
Sn layer was thinner, more Ni atoms could reach
the Cu side, and this is the reason why Cu3Sn in
Ni/(100 lm Sn)/Cu was thinner than that in
Ni/(400 lm Sn)/Cu. This proposition was confirmed
by the fact that (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 in Fig. 5b has more
Ni than (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 in Fig. 7b.
Figure 12a shows the Ni/Sn diffusion couples
after aging at 160C for 500 h. A layer of Ni3Sn4 had
formed at the interface, resulting in Ni/Ni3Sn4/Sn. A
layer of Cu was then electroplated on the Su surface
of Ni/Ni3Sn4/Sn, forming a Ni/Ni3Sn4/Sn/Cu diffu-
sion couple. This diffusion couple was then aged at
160C for an additional 100 h. Figure 12b shows the
resulting microstructure. It can be seen that part of
the original Ni3Sn4 layer had been converted into
(Cu1-xNix)6Sn5 because of the Cu atoms coming from
the Cu side. This result vividly shows the rapid
diffusion of Cu across the Sn layer. In fact, given
enough aging time, the entire Ni3Sn4 phase will be
replaced by (Cu1-xNix)6Sn5.
SUMMARY
In this study on the Ni/Sn/Cu diffusion couples at
160C, the Cu atoms could diffuse through the
100 lm or even 400 lm Sn layer and change the
reaction product on the Ni side in a few hundreds
hours. Under the same conditions, the Ni atoms
could also diffuse through the Sn layer and became
incorporated into Cu6Sn5 on the Cu side, and the
incorporated Ni atoms would then reduce the
growth rate of Cu3Sn. This study is the first positive

The effect of electric current on the tin whisker growth on Sn stripes was
studied. The Sn stripes, 1 lm in thickness, were patterned on silicon wafers.
The design of the Sn stripes allowed the simultaneous study of the effect of
current crowding and current density. Current stressing was performed in
ovens set at 30, 50, or 70C, and the current density used ranged from
4.5 · 104 A/cm2 to 3.6 · 105 A/cm2. It was found that the stress induced by the
electric current caused the formation of many Sn whiskers. A higher current
density caused more Sn whiskers to form. Of the three temperatures studied,
50C was the most favorable one for the formation of the Sn whiskers. In
addition, the current-crowding effect also influenced whisker growth.
Key words: Tin whisker, electromigration, current crowding
INTRODUCTION
The Sn surface finish is a very promising lead-free
replacement for the eutectic PbSn surface finish for
electronic components. Nevertheless, one key con-
cern about the Sn surface finish is the tendency for
the spontaneous growth of tin whiskers.1,2 Tin
whisker growth is a well-known stress relief phe-
nomenon. Excessive growth of long whiskers pre-
sents the possibility that two neighboring circuits
might be bridged, causing short circuit failure. The
first published report of tin whiskers dates back to
the 1940s.3 Since then, many researchers have
studied the factors affecting whisker formation.4–12
It is generally accepted that the coupling of two
irreversible processes is necessary for tin whisker
growth.12 First, a continuous compressive stress
must be generated in the Sn to maintain the driving
force. Second, the continuous stress generation in
Sn is relaxed through the growth of whiskers to
maintain dynamic equilibrium.12 Any process that
can generate compressive stress may contribute to
the growth of the Sn whiskers. To date, sources of
compressive stress originating from mechanical,
thermal, and chemical processes have been identi-
fied.
It is widely known that electromigration can
generate back-stress in metal lines. When an elec-
tric current passes through a metal line with a finite
length, the atoms in the metal line are pushed by
the moving electrons in the direction of the electron
flow. The electromigration of the metal atoms builds
up a compressive stress field on the anode side. This
led to the possibility that electric current might also
contribute to the formation of the Sn whiskers.
Recently, it was indeed observed that electron flow
could cause Sn whisker growth in straight Sn
lines.13 It was reported that the whisker growth
rate was faster when the applied current density
was higher.13 However, the geometry of the Sn
stripes used was limited to straight lines,13, and the
effect of current crowding was not investigated. One
of the objectives of this study is to use Sn stripes of a
more complicated geometry so that the effect of
current crowding can be studied.
EXPERIMENT
The Sn line pattern used in this study is shown in
Fig. 1. The circles are the contact pads for the
electrodes. Any two of the five pads could serve as
the electron input or output terminals so that elec-
trons could pass through the desired segment(s) of
the pattern. The width of the segments ranged from

Fig. 2a were stressed continuously for 1 h, and were
then examined under SEM. The specimen in Fig. 2b
was a different specimen and was stressed continu-
ously for 5 h without interruption. All the other
specimens in this study were handled this way. We
did try to use one specimen for multiple stressing-
SEM cycles. In other words, we tried to apply the
current stress again to the same specimen after the
SEM observation so that we could follow the growth
of each individual Sn whisker. Unfortunately, during
SEM observation, the accumulated internal stress in
the Sn stripes was relieved due to the e-beam irra-
diation. The e-beam irradiated Sn stripes had to go
through an incubation period for the stress to accu-
mulate before the whisker would grow again. As a
result, the extent of the Sn whisker growth from a
specimen that goes through two 2-h stress-SEM
cycles will be different from that of a specimen that
goes through a continuous 4-h stressing.
Figure 2a shows that after 1 h of current stress, a
few whiskers had formed at region A. At regions
B–E, where the current density was lower, no
whiskers could be observed. Figure 2b and c shows
that many more whiskers had formed and that
these whiskers tended to grow longer with time.
There were only a few isolated whiskers in region B
and no whisker at all in regions C–E after 10 h of
current stress.
It should be noted that no whisker at all was
observed in sample set 5. In other words, when
there was no applied current, no whiskers would
grow. Therefore, it can be concluded that the growth
of tin whisker in this study was driven by electric
current alone.
After 12 h of stress, an open circuit formed due to
local melting of the Sn stripe, as shown in Fig. 2d.
With the growth of the whiskers, Sn atoms were
driven away from a certain region, causing the local
cross-sectional area of the Sn stripe to decrease. The
decrease in the local cross-sectional area increased
the local current density, driving more Sn atoms
away. This vicious cycle continued until the Sn
stripes could not carry such a high local current
density and it melted locally.
When the current applied was reduced to 0.1 A
(sample set 3), a few whiskers were observed only
after 10 h of stressing, as shown in Fig. 3a. As before,
longer aging increased the number, as well as the
length, of the whiskers, as shown in Fig. 3b. In
summary, at 50C environmental temperature, the
incubation time for the whicker growth increased
from about 1 h to 10 h when the current density was
decreased from 3.6 · 105 A/cm2 to 1.8 · 105 A/cm2.
Temperature Effect
Sample sets 2, 3, and 4 underwent the same test
parameters except the oven temperature. A com-
parison of the results from these three sets of

Fig. 6a. During the acquisition of the results shown
in Fig. 6, the locations A and B had been by-passed.
In other words, the electron current left the Sn
stripe through the contact pad between location B
and location C shown in Fig. 1. If locations A and B
had not been by-passed, the Sn stripe would have
failed at location A after about 12 h of current
stress. It can be clearly seen that whiskers only
appeared at the inner corners of the 90 turn
between the two connecting line segments. There
was no whisker at the outer corners of the 90 turn.
The number of whiskers at the inner corner
increased with the stress time, as shown in Fig. 6b
and c. It should be pointed out that the inner cor-
ners were where the current-crowding effect was
important. A finite element simulation of the cur-
rent density distribution for location C is shown in
Fig. 7. The simulation shows that the inner corners,
indeed, have the highest current density and the
highest current density gradient.
The average current density at location C of
sample set 1 was, in fact, relatively low: only one-
quarter of that at location A. As shown in Fig. 2a,
it took only 1 h for some whiskers to form at
location A, due to its higher current density, and the
formation of whiskers here was not limited to the
inner corners. In contrast, even after 50 h of current
stress, at location C no whisker was observed,
except at the inner corners, as shown in Fig. 6a.
Apparently, current crowding was able to cause the
whiskers to form at a relatively low average current
density, which, otherwise, would not have induced
the whisker growth, even after a relatively lengthy
period of current stress.
SUMMARY
The stress generated by the electromigration was
able to induce the Sn whisker growth. When the
current density was 3.6 · 105 A/cm2, some whiskers
formed in as short a time as 1 h. Increasing the
current density caused more whiskers to form and
then to grow at a higher rate. When the current
density was reduced to 4.5 · 104 A/cm2, no whiskers

Flip-chip solder joints with Cu/Ni/Al underbump metallurgy (UBM) on the
chip and an Au/Ni surface finish on the substrate were studied under current
stressing at an ambient temperature of 150C. Three different Ni thicknesses
in the Cu/Ni/Al UBM (0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 lm) were used in order to investigate
the effect of the Ni thickness on reliability. The solder used was eutectic
Pb-Sn, and the applied current density was 5 · 103 A/cm2. The results show
that the combined effect of current crowding and the local Joule heating near
the entry points of electrons into the joints induced asymmetric Ni UBM
consumption. Once the Ni was exhausted in a certain region, this region be-
came nonconductive and the flow of electrons was diverted to the neighboring
region. This neighboring region then became the place where electrons en-
tered the joint, and the Ni UBM there was consumed at an accelerated rate.
This process repeated itself, and the Ni-depleted region continued to extend,
creating an ever larger nonconductive region. The solder joints eventually
failed when the nonconductive region extended across the entire contact
window of the joints. This failure model supports the observation that joints
with a thicker Ni tend to have a longer average lifetime.
Key words: Flip chip, electromigration, solder
INTRODUCTION
As flip-chip solder joints become smaller, the joints
have to endure an ever higher current density. Be-
cause of this increase, failures caused by electromi-
gration become a real reliability concern.1–9
Depending on the experimental conditions, such as
the temperature, current density, UBM, and surface
finish design, and circuit design, several failure
mechanisms have been identified, including void
formation and propagation,10,11 the local melting
mechanism,12 and the UBM dissolution mecha-
nism.13,14 Recently, it was pointed out that the
asymmetrical consumption of the Ni layer in UBM
could also caused failures.15,16 To extend the lifetime
of those solder joints that are prone to fail through
the asymmetrical consumption of the Ni layer, the
use of a thicker Ni UBM layer is a logical avenue.
Nevertheless, there is no published report to verify
this strategy. In this study, we focus on the effect of
Ni UBM thickness on the lifetime of flip-chip solder
joints. Specifically, three different Ni thicknesses,
0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 lm, were used to study the effect of
Ni thickness on the mean time to failure (MTTF) of
flip-chip solder joints under current stressing.
EXPERIMENTAL
The test chips had a daisy-chained circuit and
were mounted on substrates. The solder joints had
the configuration illustrated schematically in Fig. 1.
The chips had Al interconnect lines, which were
60 lm wide and 1 lm thick. The diameter of the
contact window was 90 lm. The UBM on the chips
had a Cu/Ni/Al structure. The Cu (0.8 lm) and the
Ni layers were sputter-deposited. Three different Ni

shown in Fig. 4c, no void occurred in the solder joint
even though the MTTF value (384 h) suggested that
it was about to fail. The joint failed at 420 h, as
shown in Fig. 3d. The coarsened Pb-Sn eutectic
structure was replaced by a finer one, suggesting
that the entire joint had melted at failure. Figure 3d
also shows that no electromigration-induced void
can be seen in the solder.

Cu-Cr UBM and solder.18 It was commented that
the porous layer might have a high electrical resis-
tance.18 In other words, the porous structure
resulting from the reaction between Cu-Cr and
solder might also have the ability to divert the
electrons.
Failure Mechanism and the MTTF
The void formation and propagation mechanism
was reported to be a major failure mechanism under
several different stressing conditions.2,3,10–12 In this
mechanism, a void forms in the solder at the location
with the highest local current density, and the
electrons are diverted around the void, making the
solder next to the edge of the void become the highest
current density region. This causes the void to grow
toward the region with the highest current density.
This process repeats itself, and the void gradually
propagates until an open circuit is created. However,
in this study, the role of the void was replaced by the
porous structure, which presumably was noncon-
ductive. Once the porous structure formed, the
electrons were diverted to nearby region, causing
the porous structure to extend toward that region.
The joints failed when the porous structure extended
all the way across the joint. In the void formation
and propagation mechanism, one key factor deter-
mining the MTTF is the incubation time for void
nucleation.11 Once the void nucleates, its propaga-
tion can cause the joint to fail very quickly. In the Ni
UBM consumption mechanism observed in this
study, the key factor determining the MTTF was the
time required to consume a certain thickness of the
Ni UBM. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the thicker the Ni
UBM, the longer the MTTF.
Void formation and propagation and Ni UBM
consumption are competing mechanisms. If a void
nucleates before the Ni UBM is consumed, void
formation and propagation will be the dominant
mechanism. Conversely, if the Ni UBM is consumed
before the void nucleates, Ni UBM consumption will
be the dominant mechanism. If the UBM design and
the materials used are kept the same, the stressing
conditions, which include the applied current den-
sity, the environmental temperature, the heat dis-
sipation capacity of the package, and the chip/
package circuit design, which determines the
amount of Joule heating, will determine the domi-
nant mechanism.
SUMMARY
It was found that the combined effect of higher
local current density and the resulting local Joule
heating in Ni UBM was able to produce locally
accelerated Ni consumption. Once the Ni UBM was
exhausted at a location, a porous structure formed.
As this structure was nonconductive, the electrons
were diverted to the neighboring region where Ni
UBM was still intact. This process repeated itself
and eventually the porous structure extended
across the entire contact window, causing the joint
to fail. For the solder joints that failed according to
this mechanism, a thicker Ni UBM was able to in-
crease the MTTF. This study found that the MTTF
for the solder joints with 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 lm Ni
UBM were 384, 736, and 1,269 h, respectively.
The role of the porous structure in the Ni UBM
consumption mechanism was similar to the role
played by the void in the void formation and prop-
agation mechanism in that they were both noncon-
ductive and could divert the electrons to nearby
regions. The diverted electrons then caused the
porous structure or the void to extend toward the
new high-current-density region. These two mech-
anisms competed with each other, and the final
failure mechanism depended on the chip/package
design and the stressing conditions.

The high local temperature in flip-chip solder joints of microprocessors has raised
concerns that the solder, a low melting temperature alloy, might locally liquefy and
consequently cause failure of the microprocessors. This article reports a highly
interesting electromigration behavior when the solder is in the molten state. A
6.3 × 103 A/cm2 electron current was applied to molten Sn3.5Ag solder at 255 °C
through two Cu electrodes. The high current density caused rapid dissolution of the
Cu cathode. The dissolved Cu atoms were driven by electrons to the anode side and
precipitated out as a thick, and sometimes continuous, layer of Cu6Sn5. The applied
current caused the dissolution rate of the Cu cathode to increase by one order of
magnitude. A major difference between the electromigration in the solid and molten
state was identified to be the presence of different countering fluxes in response to
electromigration. For electromigration in the molten state, the back-stress flux, which
was operative for electromigration in the solid state, was missing, and instead a
countering flux due to the chemical potential gradient was present. An equation for
the chemical potential gradient, d/dx, required to balance the electromigration flux
was derived to be d/dx  N°z*eJ, where N° is Avogadro’s number, z* is the
effective charge of Cu, e is the charge of an electron,  is the resistivity of the solder,
and J is the electron current density.
I. INTRODUCTION
To meet the demand for decreasing packaging size, the
electron current density through the flip-chip solder
joints of microprocessors has to increase with every new
generation of devices. It is anticipated the current density
through flip-chip solder joints will soon reach 104
A/cm2.1 At such a current density level, two concurrent
processes, electromigration and Joule heating, present
challenging materials problems.2 Several failure mecha-
nisms have been reported for flip-chip solder joints under
the stressing of high current density. In the void forma-
tion-and-propagation mechanism,3,4 a void first initiates
at the current density crowding region. It then extends
along the under bump metallurgy (UBM)/solder inter-
face, and eventually forms a gap between the UBM and
the solder, resulting in an open circuit failure. The main
process responsible for this mechanism is electromigra-
tion. Joule heating plays a secondary role in raising the
local temperature. Nevertheless, Joule heating can play a
more dominating role under certain conditions. Recently,
the local melting of the solder induced by Joule heating
was identified as an operative failure mechanism.5,6
Moreover, Alam et al.6 pointed out the rapid Cu disso-
lution reported in the literature7−9 was in fact caused by
the contact of the Cu UBM with the molten solder. Be-
cause under certain conditions solder can become molten
during current stressing, the knowledge of electromigra-
tion behaviors in molten solder alloys becomes important.
The objective of this study is to examine Cu electro-
migration in molten Sn3.5Ag (wt%) solder, which is an
important lead-free solder alloy. For comparison, elec-
tromigration in the solid state is also performed for the
same system at the same current density.

cathode was not homogeneous along the cathode/solder
interface. The presence of a trapped air bubble was able
to hinder the dissolution of nearby Cu, probably through
disrupting the electron flow through that region. When
the time reached 120 min and beyond, Cu6Sn5 no longer
had the rod morphology but exhibited the layered mor-
phology, as shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d).
To clarify the effect of the electron current, samples
were put through the same thermal histories as those of
Fig. 3, i.e., at 255 °C for different periods of time, but
with no current applied. The effect of electron current
can be seen by comparing Fig. 3 with Fig. 5, which
shows the no-current samples kept at 255 °C. As can be
seen in Fig. 5, only a small amount of Cu6Sn5 scallops
and a thin layer of Cu3Sn formed at the Cu/solder inter-
faces on both sides. The microstructure in Fig. 5 is typi-
cal of the Cu/solder reaction and has been reported many
times in the literature.11,12 The consumed thickness of
each Cu wire for the no-current cases is shown in Fig. 4. As
seen in Fig. 4, application of the electron current accelerated
Cu consumption by about one order of magnitude.
Figures 3–5 clearly show that the dissolution of the Cu
cathode was caused by the applied current because oth-
erwise the Cu dissolution was quite small. Please note
that the dissolution of the two Cu electrodes was asym-
metrical when a current was applied. Only the dissolution
of the Cu cathode was accelerated, and the consumption
rate of the Cu anode did not increase. In fact, the con-
sumption rate of the Cu anode was even smaller than the
no-current case, and this is not shown in Fig. 4 because
it is too small to be measured accurately.

Cu foil was attacked by the solder on both surfaces, the
single-side dissolution rate should then be 4.35 m/min.
The experimental conditions (a small piece of thin foil
dipped into a very large amount of solder) used by Huang
et al. approached the limit c ≈ 0. In other words, the value
4.35 m/min can be considered the maximum dissolu-
tion rate of Cu into Sn3.5Ag at 250 °C. As shown in
Fig. 4, the initial dissolution rate, estimated by using
linear extrapolation, was 1.3 m/min when the electron
current was applied. This value is below the maximum
value of 4.35 m/min. Therefore, one may conclude ap-
plying the current did not “accelerate” the dissolution
beyond the maximum rate. It only somehow retained the
high dissolution rate that the system would experience
during the early stage of the dissolution. In other words,
from Eq. (1), the applied current somehow reduced the
value of c near the interface so the dissolution rate could
remain high even though enough Cu atoms had entered
the molten solder to make c approach cs.
Before discussing how the applied current reduced the
c value near the interface, we need to gain an idea of the
value of cs and the amount of dissolution needed to reach
cs. According to the binary Cu–Sn phase diagram,16 the
saturation solubility of Cu in Sn at 255 °C is ≈1.6 wt%.
Assuming the Cu wires in Fig. 1 can dissolve only in the
longitudinal direction, one can estimate to have the sol-
der in Fig. 1 saturated with Cu at 255 °C, a total length
of 9.2 m has to be dissolved from the two Cu wires. The
value was in qualitative agreement with the consumed
thickness of the Cu wires for the case where no current
was applied (see Fig. 4). Figure 4 shows that, at 30 min,
6 m of Cu had been consumed on each Cu wire (for a
total consumed thickness of 2 × 6  12 m) when no
current was applied. After 30 min, the consumed
thickness increased only very slightly. To sum up, if no
current was applied, the solder became saturated with Cu
very quickly (≈30 min). Afterward, the dissolution rate
approached zero according to Eq. (1). At this stage, the
FIG. 6. Micrographs showing the sequence of events during current stressing at 200 °C, which is below the SnAg eutectic temperature at 221 °C.
The current density through the solder was 6.3 × 103 A/cm2, and the electrons flowed from the left side to the right: (a) after 180 min,
(b) 2400 min, and (c) 4000 min of current stressing.

The analysis above is able to explain the trend shown
in Fig. 4 that the consumption rate of the Cu cathode
decreased as time increased, particularly at the later stage
of the experiment. This trend can be understood by not-
ing in Fig. 3 the length (x) of the remaining solder
between the Cu cathode and Cu6Sn5 decreased with time.
As x decreased, the absolute value of Jchemical increased
according to Eq. (3). In other words, Jchemical was able to
counter Jem flux to a greater and greater degree, and the
net Cu flux Jtotal decreased, resulting in a smaller Cu
consumption rate.
V. SUMMARY
High electron current density caused the Cu cathode to
dissolve at an accelerated rate, which was one order of
magnitude greater than the no-current case. The dis-
solved Cu atoms were then driven by the electron current
to the anode side and precipitated out as Cu6Sn5. Unlike
electromigration in the solid state, there was no back-
stress flux to counter the electromigration flux in molten
solder. There was, instead, a chemical potential flux to
counter the electromigration. The chemical potential gra-
dient, d/dx required to balance the electromigration flux
was derived to be d/dx  N°z*eJ.

Platinum does not oxidize easily, and has slow reaction rates with Sn-based
solders. Due to these two positive attributes, a single platinum layer has the
potential to replace both the oxidation protection layer and the diffusion
barrier layer in the underbump metallurgy of flip-chip devices. To evaluate
this potential further, the dissolution rate and the wetting properties of Pt
were investigated in this study. It was found that Pt did have a dissolution
rate less than half that of Ni, currently the most popular barrier layer
material. The wetting properties of Pt were not as good as those of Ni but were
nevertheless still acceptable for industrial applications. In short, as far as the
dissolution and the wetting characteristics are concerned, Pt is an effective top
surface layer for use in underbump metallurgy.

INTRODUCTION
In microelectronic, optoelectronic, and micro-
electromechanical systems (MEMS) packages, the
contact pads for soldering have a multiple-layer
structure, including typically an oxidation protec-
tion layer, a diffusion barrier layer, and a wetting
layer. A good example of this multiple-layer struc-
ture is the Au/Ni/Cu trilayer structure, where the
Au layer is included for oxidation protection, Ni for
diffusion barrier function, and Cu for wetting. The
necessity to deposit multiple metal layers to form
contact pads adds not only production cost but also
design complexity, which always leads to higher
reliability concerns. Accordingly, there is a strong
driving force to simplify the multiple-layer struc-
ture.
The element Pt does not oxidize easily, and has
slow reaction rates with Pb-Sn solders,1–5 Sn-Cu
and Sn-Ag-Cu solders,6 and pure Sn.7 Because of
these two positive attributes, a single platinum
layer can serve dual functions as both the oxidation
protection layer and the diffusion barrier layer. In
fact, several feasibility studies of using a Pt layer in
flip-chip solder joints have been reported,3–5 and the
consensus was that Pt exhibited several promising
characteristics worthy of further evaluation.
Two types of fundamental data are required before
the use of a Pt layer for contact pads can be fully
evaluated. The first is the dissolution kinetics of Pt
into molten solders. During the assembly of devices,
the solder joints have to experience several reflows,
during which Pt is in direct contact with the molten
solder. The dissolution kinetic data are required in
order to determine the proper Pt thickness to be
used. The second fundamental data required are the
wetting characteristics of molten solders on Pt. In
order to have reliable solder joints, solders have to
wet the Pt surface in a reasonable amount of time
during assembly. The objectives of this study are to
establish these two types of data. The dissolution
kinetic data were obtained by reacting Pt with pure
Sn at 250C, 270C, 290C, and 310C for different
periods of time. For comparison, the dissolution ki-
netic data of Ni and Co were also measured. The
wetting characteristics of Pt with the Pb-Sn eutectic
solder at 230C were studied by using the wetting
balance method. The wetting characteristics of Ni(Received February 29, 2008; accepted August 6, 2008;

For comparison, the interface for the Ni-Sn sys-
tem after the reaction is shown in Fig. 1c and d, and
that for the Co-Sn system in Fig. 1e and f. As can be
seen in Fig. 1c, the only compound formed at the
interface was Ni3Sn4 when Ni reacted with Sn. At
all other temperatures and times used in this study,
only Ni3Sn4 formed, which is consistent with the
literature results.8–12 These Ni3Sn4 grains had an
aspect ratio close to 1, as shown in Fig. 1d. The
thickness of Ni3Sn4 was only about one-third of the
thickness of PtSn4 at the same reaction conditions.
The reaction between Co and Sn only produced
CoSn3, as shown in Fig. 1e. At all the other tem-
peratures and times used in this study, only CoSn3
formed. This observation was consistent with the
study reported in the literature.13 Under the same
experimental conditions, the Co-Sn reaction pro-
duced the thickest reaction product among the three
binary systems in this study, about twice that of the
Pt-Sn reaction. As shown in Fig. 1f, these CoSn3
grains also had a rod-type morphology, with an as-
pect ratio near that of PtSn4. One key difference
between PtSn4 and CoSn3 was that the former
formed a compact and protective layer, whereas the
latter formed a nonprotective, loose aggregate
structure.
Growth Kinetics
Figure 6 shows a comparison of the consumed
thickness of Pt, Ni, and Co at 250C. Platinum had
the slowest dissolution rate, and Co the highest.
Figure 7 shows that this trend is also true at all the

product. (b) Top view showing the grain structure of PtSn4. The solder had been etched away with acids. (c and d) Same as (a) and (b), but with

for the Pt and Ni substrates with the RMA-type and
water-soluble fluxes at 230C. The results indicate
that Ni performed slightly better than Pt, but for
practical purposes they were both more than
acceptable for industrial applications. For both
the wetting time and wetting force indicators, the
water-soluble flux was more effective than the
RMA-type flux because the former has more acid
component.
DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows that the intermetallic at the
interface for the Pt substrate was much thicker
than that for the Ni substrate, even though the
consumed Pt thickness was only half that of Ni
(Fig. 6). The reason for this apparent discrepancy
was that one mole of Pt atoms was able to react with
four moles of Sn to form one mole of PtSn4, while
one mole of Ni atoms could only react with 4/3 moles

the Sn bath.

protective, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The reaction
products from the reactions between Au, Pd, and Ag
and the solder were less compact, and as a result
less protective. Therefore, their dissolution rates are
much higher. The reaction product from the reac-
tion between Co and the solder was also not pro-
tective, as shown in Fig. 1e. Accordingly, Co
exhibited a faster dissolution rate than Pt, as shown
in Fig. 6.
According to the Pt-Sn phase diagram,22 there are
five stable compounds at the temperatures used in
this study: Pt3Sn, PtSn, Pt2Sn3, PtSn2, and PtSn4.
In this study, the main reaction product was PtSn4,
which was always present in a large amount in all
samples. When the reaction time increased, two
other compounds, probably Pt2Sn3 and Pt3Sn based
on the EPMA evidence, were detected. In all the
previous studies,1–7 only PtSn4 was observed. This
present study shows that, given time, the other
stable compounds on the phase diagram might form.
The saturation limits of Pt in molten Sn at dif-
ferent temperatures can be read directly from the
Pt-Sn binary phase diagram,22 and are 1 wt.%,
1.2 wt.%, 1.4 wt.%, and 2.0 wt.% at 250C, 270C,
290C, and 310C, respectively. As the Pt substrates
were consumed, the Pt concentration in the molten
solder increased. From the dimension of the Pt
substrate and the mass of the solder bath used, the
thickness of the Pt substrate that had to be dissolved
in order to make the solder baths become saturated
with Pt can be calculated to be 12 lm, 15 lm, 17 lm,
and 25 lm at 250C, 270C, 290C, and 310C,
respectively. According to Fig. 8, this amount of Pt
could be dissolved in about 1 h at each temperature.
In other words, before 1 h, the solder baths were not
saturated with Pt, and after 1 h the baths were
saturated with Pt. The kinetics reported in this
study mainly belongs to the region that the solder
had already been saturated with Pt. To study the
dissolution kinetics for the region far from satura-
tion, different experimental designs have to be used.
For example, a thin Pt wire can be used in place of
the Pt foil. The mass of the solder bath can be chosen
so that the solder is always far from saturation even
when the entire Pt wire has been consumed.
The activation energy observed in this study
(16 kJ/mol based on linear kinetics) was consider-
ably smaller than that reported in the literature.
A value of 85.4 kJ/mol was reported for Pt dissolu-
tion into 40Pb-60Sn between 485C and 535C.2 In
this study,2 a thin Pt wire was dissolved into a very
large amount of solder so that the solder was always
far from saturation. Linear dissolution kinetics was
reported. Another value of 0.63 eV (or 60 kJ/mol)
was reported for Pt dissolution into 40Pb-60Sn
between 200C and 320C.3 In this study,3 a thin
40Pb-60Sn layer (100 lm) was used over Pt. The
amount of solder used was small, and the solder was
saturated with Pt rather quickly. Parabolic dissolu-
tion kinetics was observed. These two literature
results reported two very different phenomena (linear
versus parabolic kinetics; large versus small solder
volume). Activation energies determined from dif-
ferent (linear/parabolic) kinetics should not be com-
pared. From the above discussion, one knows that
the way in which the experiments are carried out is
important. In all previous studies, the Pt was eval-
uated alone. In the present study, Pt was evaluated
side by side with Ni and Co under the same experi-
mental conditions, and we positively confirmed that
in the dissolution kinetics Pt performed better than
Ni and Co under the same experimental conditions.
This study shows that the wetting of eutectic
Pb-Sn solder on Pt was not as good as that on a Ni
substrate when the RMA-type and water-soluble
fluxes were used. As had been pointed out in the
literature,23,24 wetting characteristics are not only
affected by the substrates but also by the types of
fluxes applied. Using different fluxes is in fact
equivalent to using different substrates because the
solid/flux and liquid/flux interfacial tensions vary
with flux type.23,24 In short, to achieve good wetting,
the type of flux used is no less important than the
substrate itself. Consequently, if a new flux can be
developed specifically for Pt substrates, there is
hope that wetting characteristics better than those
reported in this study can be achieved for Pt.
SUMMARY
The Pt dissolution rate into molten Sn at 250C to
310C was smaller than that of Ni. In fact, the Pt
dissolution rates were less than one-half of the
value for Ni at all investigated temperatures. From
the wetting balance study, the wetting time of Pt
was not quite as good as that of Ni. Nevertheless,
the wetting characteristics of Pt were still accept-
able for UBM and surface finish applications. In
summary, as far as consumption rate and wetting
characteristics are concerned, a single Pt layer does
have the potential to serve as both the oxidation-
protection layer and the diffusion barrier layer.
Future studies should focus on joint strength eval-
uation and reliability verification.
During the reaction between Pt and molten Sn,
the major reaction product was PtSn4, although two
other compounds, likely to be Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn3, did
form at higher temperature reactions (‡270C). The
dissolution followed linear kinetics, with an appar-
ent activation energy of 16 kJ/mol.

sphere only over this wettable opening. Two types of Cu substrates
were used, electroplated Cu and OFHC Cu. The Cu plating solution
was CuSO4-based and did not contain the C6H12O6S4Na2 additive.
The reﬂow temperature proﬁle had a peak temperature of 235 C
and 90 s duration during which the solder was molten. The nomi-
nal ramp rate and cooling rate were both 1.5 C/s. After reﬂow, the
samples were subjected to solid-state aging at 160 C for 500, 1000
or 2000 h.
The samples were then mounted in epoxy, sectioned by using a
low-speed diamond saw, and metallurgically polished in prepara-
tion for characterization. The reaction zone for each sample was
examined using an optical microscope and a scanning electron
microscope (SEM). The compositions of the reaction products were
determined using an electron microprobe, operated at 15 keV. In
microprobe analysis, the concentration of each element was mea-
sured independently, and the total weight percentage of all ele-
ments was within 100 ± 1% in each case. For every data point, at
least four measurements were made and the average value was
reported.
3. Results
Fig. 1a1–a4 shows the backscattered electron micrographs for
the samples using the electroplated Cu substrate with different
Ni additions that were reﬂowed for one time. The corresponding
micrographs for the OFHC substrates are shown in Fig. 2a1–a4.
For both types of Cu substrates, the Cu6Sn5 phase is clearly visible.
At this stage, the Cu6Sn5 phase was the only phase observed at the
interface, and Cu3Sn was not observed. Comparing Fig. 1a1–a4 to
their counterparts in Fig. 2a1–a4, one concludes that these two dif-
ferent substrates produced essentially the same microstructure. In
other words, the substrate effect was not important in the as-re-
ﬂow condition.
Figs. 1a1–a4 and 2a1–a4 also shows that the additions of Ni to
Sn2.5Ag made the amount of Cu6Sn5 at the interface increase sub-
stantially. For Sn2.5Ag without any Ni addition, the Cu6Sn5 layer
was thin, continuous, and void-free, consistent with the classical
scallop microstructure reported in the literature [14–16]. With
the addition of 0.01 wt.% Ni, Cu6Sn5 still retained the scallop micro-
structure. Nevertheless, with the addition of 0.03 wt.% Ni, Cu6Sn5
became thicker, and had many voids between these Cu6Sn5 grains.
As had been pointed out in our previous study [11,12], these voids
were originally occupied by trapped solder. During sample prepa-
ration, the trapped solder in these voids was etched away. When
the Ni addition increased even more, the amount of Cu6Sn5 near
the interface increased correspondingly. The above observation
showed that Cu6Sn5 formed at the interface without regard to
the Ni additions. The alloy additions, however, did change the
amount of Cu6Sn5 and its microstructures at the interface.
Fig. 1b1–d4 shows the micrographs for the samples using the
electroplated Cu substrate with different Ni additions that were
aged for 500, 1000 and 2000 h. The corresponding micrographs
for the OFHC substrates are shown in Fig. 2b1–d4. In all cases,
two intermetallic compounds, the Cu6Sn5-based phase and the
Cu3Sn-based phase, formed. These two compounds both exhibited
a dense layered structure. The voids within the Cu6Sn5 phase
formed during the reﬂow had disappeared after 500 h of aging.
Figs. 1 and 2 show that, for all combinations of Ni additions and
Cu substrates, both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn thickened with aging. During
aging, the most striking feature is that the additions of Ni substan-
tially reduced the Cu3Sn to Cu6Sn5 thickness ratio. For samples
with the same aging, the Ni additions had different effects on the
growth of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn. Ni additions to Sn2.5Ag increased
the Cu6Sn5 thickness substantially, as shown in Fig. 3. The Ni addi-
tions, however, decreased the Cu3Sn thickness substantially, as
shown in Fig. 4. In short, the types of the Cu substrate did not seem
to have a clear effect on the growths kinetics of Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn.

Although the compound formation did not change with the Ni
addition, the amount of compound at the interface did increase
substantially with Ni additions, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Our re-
cent preliminary data show that for a given Ni addition, different
cooling rates produced different amounts Cu6Sn5 near the inter-
face, with slower cooling rate producing thicker Cu6Sn5. This obser-
vation seems to suggest that a major part of the Cu6Sn5 actually
formed during the solidiﬁcation of the solder. A faster cooling rate
corresponded to less time for Cu diffusion, and as a result the dis-
solved Cu atoms precipitated out as Cu6Sn5 evenly throughout the
entire joint. Consequently, less Cu6Sn5 located near the interface.
Conversely, a slower cooling rate corresponded to more time for
Cu diffusion, and as a result the dissolved Cu atoms could diffuse
back to the interface to precipitate out as Cu6Sn5, and more Cu6Sn5
located near the interface. Similar cooling rate effect had also been
reported in a very recent study on the reaction between Sn and
CuNi alloy substrates with various compositions [17].
An interesting observation was that additions Ni was able to
reduce the Cu3Sn thickness substantially. It was effective even
after aging at 160 C for 2000 h, which surpassed the typical
industrial high temperature storage requirement of 150 C for
1000 h. The reason why Ni addition was effective in reducing
the Cu3Sn thickness is unclear at this moment. Several theories
have been proposed, including thermodynamic arguments [18]
and kinetic arguments [12,19]. More studies are needed to eluci-
date this point. The reduced Cu3Sn thickness with the Ni addition
was helpful in reducing the amount of voids within Cu3Sn, be-
cause the formation of these voids was directly related to the
growth of the Cu3Sn layer.
This study shows that the types of Cu substrate used have a
prominent effect on the observation of Kirkendall voids within
the Cu3Sn layer. The reason why the Cu substrate had such a strong
effect deserves further discussion. Other than the Kirkendall voids,
the two different substrates, electroplated and OFHC, behaved very
similarly, in term of the intermetallic growth kinetics and micro-
structure. Since the growth kinetics and microstructure were con-
trolled to a large degree by the interdiffusion of the elements, it
seems reasonable to assume that as far as diffusion-related phe-
nomena were concerned the two types of substrate behaved the
same. In short, the Cu substrates simply served as the end-mem-
bers of the diffusion couples, and maintained a constant Cu ther-
modynamic activity at the Cu/Cu3Sn interface.
If the diffusion-related phenomena were the same for both
types of substrate, then what was the reason why the Kirkendall
voids were observed for one type of substrate, but not for the
other? It was very likely that the impurities in electroplated Cu
helped the nucleation of the voids. Assuming all the atoms in
Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn diffused by vacancy mechanism, one notes that
there were two necessary conditions for the formation of the
Kirkendall voids. The ﬁrst was that the total out-going atomic ﬂux
was greater than the total in-coming atomic ﬂux for a certain
controlled volume. There was consequently a net in-coming va-
cancy ﬂux into the controlled volume due to the un-balanced
atomic ﬂux. These in-coming vacancies were at the same time de-
stroyed at vacancy sinks that existed in any materials, such as
dislocations. The vacancy concentration was determined by the
in-coming vacancy ﬂux minus those vacancies destroyed by var-
ious vacancy sinks. The vacancy concentration had to be higher
than a certain critical value for the nucleation of the voids to oc-
cur. A vacancy concentration higher than this critical value was
the second necessary condition for the formation of the voids.
In electroplated Cu, impurities and crystal imperfections are
imbedded during the electroplating process. These impurities
and imperfections might play key roles in assisting the void
nucleation. These impurities and imperfections might lower the
critical vacancy concentration value by serving as the heteroge-
neous nucleation sites for void nucleation. This was probably
the reason why Kirkendall voids were only observed for electro-
plated Cu even though the diffusional characteristics, expressed
in term of growth kinetics and phase microstructure, were quite
similar for both substrates. Very recently, it was pointed out that
the electroplating additive indeed had a very strong effect on the
void formation and its distribution within the Cu3Sn layer. It was
indicated that the electroplating additive assisted the formation
of the voids by accelerating the void nucleation [20].
The identity of Cu6Sn5 is in fact a rather complicated issue. At
temperatures lower than 186 C, Cu6Sn5 exhibits a monoclinic g’
structure [21,22]. Recent studies, nevertheless, showed that Ni
was able to stabilize the high temperature hexagonal g structure.
Since Ni was observed in Cu6Sn5 in this study, these Cu6Sn5 might
in fact have the high temperature hexagonal g structure. A recent
phase diagram study, that has detailed information on this issue,
has been published very recently [23].
5. Summary
(1) Kirkendall voids formed only when electroplated Cu was
used. No such void was observed when OFHC Cu was used.
(2) Apart from the Kirkendall voids, the two different Cu sub-
strates behaved very similarly, in term of intermetallic thick-
ness and microstructure.

Fig. 1. Backscattered electron micrographs for samples with different Ni additions that were reﬂowed 1, 3, and 10 times. The Cu6Sn5 phase was the only compound observed
at the interface.
resulting number was taken to be the average thickness of that
compound.
Fig. 1 shows the backscattered electron micrographs for sam-
ples with different levels of Ni additions that were reﬂowed for
1, 3, or 10 times. The microstructures after 5 reﬂows were some-
where between those after 3 and 10 reﬂows, and are not shown
for brevity. The symbol SAC stands for the Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu solder
without any Ni addition, and SAC0.005Ni stands for Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu
with 0.005wt.% Ni addition, etc. In all cases, the Cu6Sn5 phase was
the only phase observed at the interface. The phase Cu3Sn was not
observed at this stage, but would appear after the solid-state aging.
As can be seen in Fig. 1(b1)–(b3), with 0.005wt.% Ni added, Cu6Sn5
exhibited a microstructure quite similar to that of SAC, shown in
Fig. 1(a1)–(a3). In the literature, this microstructure was described
as the scallop-type microstructure [9,11–14]. In this microstruc-
ture, Cu6Sn5 was nearly continuous and void-free. When the Ni
concentration reached 0.01wt.%, shown in Fig. 1(c1)–(c3), Cu6Sn5
was slightly thicker but still exhibited features of the scallop-type
microstructure. Only when the Ni concentration increased beyond
0.06wt.% did Cu6Sn5 become the needle-like microstructure, with
small regions of trapped solder between the Cu6Sn5 grains. This
needle-likemicrostructurehadalsobeendescribedas thecolumnar
microstructure [3,5,6] or theaggregate-typemicrostructure [1]. The
amounts of Cu6Sn5 near the interface for various conditions were
plotted in Fig. 2. The amount of Cu6Sn5 increased with both the
number of reﬂows and the increasing Ni concentration. An expla-
nation for this dependency had been presented elsewhere [7]. To
sum up, the addition of 0.01wt.% Ni did not change the Cu6Sn5
microstructure too much, and also did not thicken this phase sub-
stantially. As far as the effect of Ni addition on the Cu6Sn5 phase is
concerned, 0.01wt.% Ni addition appears to be an acceptable level.
After aging at 160 ◦C, Cu3Sn appearedwith a layeredmicrostruc-
ture between Cu6Sn5 and Cu, as shown in Fig. 3. The Cu6Sn5 phase
also changed itsmicrostructure from the scallop-type to the layered
microstructure. The transformation from non-layered to layered
microstructure during solid-state aging is typical inmany soldering

somewhere between those of 500 and 2000h. The data in Fig. 4
indicate that, for aging time equal to or shorter than 500h, the
0.005wt.% Ni addition was as effective as higher levels Ni addition.
However, compared tohigher levelsNi addition, the effectiveness of
0.005wt.% addition reduced by a noticeable degreewhen the aging
time reached 2000h. The addition of 0.01wt.% Ni addition, on the
other hand, was as effective as higher levels of Ni addition even
after 2000h of aging at 160 ◦C. It should be noted that the indus-
trial high temperature storage requirement is typically at 150 ◦C for
1000h. Consequently, 0.01wt.%Ni additionappears tobeanaccept-
able level of addition for inhibiting the Cu3Sn growth for industrial
applications.
The Ni effect in reducing the Cu3Sn thickness had been reported
beforebyus [1], andbyothers [2–6].However, theminimumNicon-
centration that is effective in retarding the Cu3Sn growth and at the
same timenot inducing anexcessiveCu6Sn5 formationhasnot been
properly identiﬁed before. The previous minimum Ni addition (to
Sn0.7Cu solder) used was 0.05wt.% [3], and in this particular study
the most severe aging condition was 150 ◦C for 504h. It was found
that [3], among0.05, 0.1, and0.2wt.%Ni additions to Sn0.7Cu solder,
0.05wt.% Ni addition had a minimum combined Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn
thickness.Nevertheless, our study is theﬁrst to shows that0.01wt.%
Ni addition was effective in retarding the Cu3Sn growth, even after
aging at 160 ◦C for 2000h. In addition, this level of Ni addition also
did not cause an excessive Cu6Sn5 growth during the reﬂow stage.
In short, 0.01wt.% appear to be the optimal Ni addition as far as the
formation and growth of the intermetallics are concerned.
The reason why Ni addition is effective in reducing the Cu3Sn
thickness is unclear at this moment. Several theories have been
proposed, including thermodynamic arguments [6] and kinetic
arguments [10,16]. It was likely that the Ni addition somehow
increased the ratio of interdiffusion ﬂux through the Cu6Sn5 layer
and the Cu3Sn layer [16]. It is widely known that a phase with a
higher interdiffusion coefﬁcient will grew faster at the expense of
its neighboring phase that has a lower interdiffusion coefﬁcient
[16]. Nevertheless, the mechanism explaining how the Ni addi-
tion can change the ratio of interdiffusion ﬂux is still lacking. More
studies are needed to elucidate this point.
It should be noted that thewayNiwas introduced into the react-
ing system did not seem to matter as far as hindering the Cu3Sn
growth was concerned. It had been reported that the growth of
Cu3Sn was hindered even if Ni-alloyed Cu substrates were used.
These substrates included Cu alloyed with 6–9wt.% Ni [17] and Cu
alloyedwith 15at.%Ni [18]. The lowconcentration required in order
forNi addition to be effective reported in this study (0.005wt.%) can
explain why Ni-alloyed Cu substrates also worked. During reﬂow,
the substrate dissolved into the molten solder and the dissolved Ni
atoms functionedasanadditive to the solders. Sinceonly0.005wt.%
Ni in solder is needed to be effective, the thin Ni-alloyed Cu sub-
strates dissolved during reﬂow was sufﬁcient to raise the local Ni
concentration at the interface above the minimum effective con-
centration.

The reactions between Cu and the Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu solders doped with 0.03wt.% Fe, Co, or Ni were studied.
Reaction conditions included multiple reﬂows for up to 10 times and solid-state aging at 160 ◦C for up
to 2000h. In the multiple reﬂow study, Cu6Sn5 was the only reaction product noted for all the different
solders used. Reﬂows using the solder without doping produced a thin, dense layer of Cu6Sn5. Adding Fe,
Co, or Ni transformed this microstructure into a much thicker Cu6Sn5 with many small trapped solder
regions between the Cu6Sn5 grains. In the solid-state aging study, both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn formed, but
adding Fe, Co, or Ni produced a much thinner Cu3Sn layer. Because the Cu3Sn growth had been linked
to the formation of micro voids, which in turn increased the potential for a brittle interfacial fracture,
thinner Cu3Sn layers might translate into better solder joint strength.

1. Introduction
In the past few years, the SnAgCu family of solders has obtained
a wide acceptance as a replacement for the PbSn eutectic solder
in electronic applications. At present, relatively fewer activities are
undertaken by researchers worldwide to develop another solder
family to replace the PbSn eutectic solder. Instead, the currentmain
research thrust in lead-free solder alloy development is on enhanc-
ing or ﬁne-tuning the various properties of SnAgCu through adding
minor alloying elements. For example, Ni was evaluated for its
potential as a minor alloying element to Sn-based lead free sol-
ders [1–8], and so were Ge [2,5], Fe [9], Co [6,8,9], Zn [5,10,11], Bi
[12], Mn [5], Ti [5], Si [5], and Cr [5]. These previous studies point
out minor alloy additions can strengthen the solder performance
in many different respects. One of the more noteworthy alloying
elements is Ni. It was shown Ni addition to Sn3.5Ag (3.5wt.% Ag,
balance Sn) in amounts as minute as 0.1wt.% could substantially
hinder the Cu3Sn growth during soldering as well as during the fol-
lowing solid-state aging [1,7]. The Cu3Sn growth had been linked
to the formation of micro voids, which in turn increased the poten-
tial for brittle interfacial fracture [13]. Recently, it was shown that
drop test performance increased for solders joints with just a small
amount of Ni addition (<1wt.%) [14].
The objective of this study is to examine whether Fe and Co
additions have a similar effect as Ni does. Emphasis is placed on

a systematic comparison study on the effect of Fe, Co, and Ni addi-
tions. Further, the level of alloy addition is reduced to as low as
0.03wt.% so the minimum effective addition of each element can
be assessed. Solders with simultaneous Fe and Ni addition as well
as simultaneous Co and Ni addition are also prepared to examine
whether there is any interaction between the alloying elements.
2. Experimental
Solder ballswith six different compositions, Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu, Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.03Fe,
Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.03Co, Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.03Ni, Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.03Fe0.03Ni, and
Sn2.5Ag0.8Cu0.03Co0.03Ni (all compositions in weight percentage), were prepared
from 99.999% purity elements. The solder ball compositions were veriﬁed using
ICP-AES (inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy), and it was
estimated the reported compositions had a maximum 0.005wt.% uncertainty. For
a given solder ball composition, there was no measurable ball-to-ball variation in
composition.
Each solder ball had a mass of 10mg. The solder balls were placed on the sol-
dering pads of BGA (ball grid array) substrates with 600m diameter opening. The
soldering pads were electroplated Cu layer coated with an OSP surface ﬁnish.
The reactions during the reﬂow and during the solid-state aging were studied
separately. The reﬂow temperature proﬁle had a peak temperature of 235 ◦C and 90 s
duration during which the solder was molten. The nominal ramp rate and cooling
rate were both 1.5 ◦C/s. The number of reﬂows was 1, 3, 5, or 10 times. Some of the
samples were subjected to solid-state aging at 160 ◦C for 500, 1000 or 2000h after
being subjected to one reﬂow.
In order to understand the effect of cooling rate on the microstructure,
Sn2.5Ag0.1Ni and Sn3Ag0.7Cu solder balls were reﬂowed over the BGA substrates.
The reﬂow temperature proﬁle was the same as before except that the cooling rates
during the solidiﬁcation were varied. Three different cooling rates, 18 ◦C/s, 0.5 ◦C/s,
and 0.2 ◦C/s were used in this part of study.
The sampleswere thenmounted in epoxy, sectionedusing a low-speeddiamond
saw, and metallurgically polished in preparation for characterization. The reaction
zone for each sample was examined using an optical microscope and a scanning

reﬂowed once during assembly. In all cases, two intermetallic
compounds, the Cu6Sn5-based phase and the Cu3Sn-based phase,
formed. These two compounds both displayed a dense layered
structure. The voids formed during the reﬂow (Fig. 1) disappeared
after 500h of aging.
Even though the concentration of the addition elements was
very low (0.03wt.%), some of the addition elements did get incor-
porated into Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn. The amounts of these incorporated
elements are shown in Table 1 for solder joints that had been added
at160 ◦C for2000h.As these concentrationsweredeterminedusing
an electron microprobe, which had an accuracy of about one per-
cent, the data in Table 1 only serves to qualitatively illustrate the
existence of these elements in Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn.
Fig. 5 also shows the thicknesses of both Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn
increased with the aging time. The most striking feature in Fig. 5
is that adding Fe, Co, or Ni substantially reduced the Cu3Sn to
Cu6Sn5 thickness ratio. The thickness data are plotted in Fig. 6(a)
for Cu6Sn5, and in Fig. 6(b) for Cu3Sn. As shown in Fig. 6(a), for
all the cases, Cu6Sn5 grew thicker with the aging time, although
the growth kinetics did not follow the parabolic kinetics very well.
The growth kinetics for Cu3Sn, shown in Fig. 6(b), had a better ﬁt
with the parabolic kinetics. The alloy additions had different effects

reﬂowed once during assembly.
4.2. Effect of cooling rate
The Sn-rich corner of the Sn–Cu–Ni isothermwas shown in Fig. 7
[7]. This isotherm shows that, with a slight Ni addition, the sol-
der alloy moved from the liquid phase ﬁeld to the liquid +Cu6Sn5
two-phase ﬁeld. It was very likely, that with this Ni addition, the
solder alloy also entered the primary solidiﬁcation phase ﬁeld of
Cu6Sn5.With the alloy now in the primary solidiﬁcation phase ﬁeld
of Cu6Sn5, a substantial amount of this compoundwould then form
when the temperature reached the liquidus surface. This was the
possible reason for theobservation thatCu6Sn5 increasedwithalloy
additions, in Figs. 1 and 2.
4.3. Reaction during aging
Fig. 6(a) shows during the solid-state aging at 160 ◦C. The
parabolic kinetics did not describe the growth of Cu6Sn5 very well.
However, the growth of Cu3Sn did follow the parabolic kinetics
closely, as shown in Fig. 6(b). This was because during the solid-
state aging, the Cu6Sn5 layer ﬁrst had to consolidate itself from

Ball impact test
The Instron MicroImpact Testing System (Instron Ltd,
Buckinghamshire, UK), whose testing configuration is
schematically shown in Figure 1 (Yeh and Lai, 2007), was
employed in this study for BIT tests. For each BIT test, a striker
was catapulted upon release of an air-compressed spring with
an impact velocity, Vi, up to 1m/s. The impact process was
therefore energy-controlled, albeit the impact velocity changed
slightly during the course of impact.
Figure 2 shows a typical BIT impact force profile. Since the
post-failure structural behaviour of the solder joint is
extremely complicated, only the ascending part of the first
peak of the impact force profile is considered, which
represents the structural behaviour of the solder joint from
the initiation of the impact load until fracturing starts (Yeh
and Lai, 2006b). Characteristics of the impact force profile as
shown in Figure 2 and those derived from these
characteristics are described in the following. The Fmax
stands for the peak impact force. For the failure mode of IMC
fracturing, Fmax corresponds to the IMC strength, which is a
mix of normal and shear adhesion strengths of the solder joint
because BIT actually brings a mixed-mode loading to the
solder joint (Yeh and Lai, 2006a, b). The tr denotes the
duration of the ascending part of the impact force profile.
If Vi varies insignificantly during the entire impact process, we
have d ø Vi £ tr , where d stands for the traveling distance of
the striker from the onset of the impact until the initiation
of fracturing in the solder joint. Either tr or d can be used as a
measure of ductility of the solder joint. The Ar is the area
below the ascending part of the impact force profile, which
represents the toughness of the solder joint. This quantity is
proportional to the impact energy exerted during the
ascending part, Er, because if Vi varies insignificantly during
the entire impact process, we have Er ø Vi £ Ar . The Sr is the
slope of the ascending part of the impact force profile. If Vi
varies insignificantly during the entire impact process, we have
Sr ø Vi £Kr , where Kr stands for the apparent stiffness of the
solder joint structure.
In this study, two sets of ball grid array solder joints with
substrates fabricated by different suppliers, denoted as A and B,
were prepared. The Sn-4Ag-0.5Cu solder balls 500mm in
diameter were mounted onto the copper substrate pads with an
immersion tin surface finish. The solder joints were in a
soldermask-defined structural configuration with soldermask
opening at 500mm.The pitch between adjacent solder jointswas
800mm.The samples underwent 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 reflow cycles,
for which the reflow profile featured an ascending temperature
rate of 0.88C/s, a descending rate of 1.18C/s, and the temperature
maintained at a 2608C peak for 4 s. For BIT, Vi was set at
500mm/swhile the standoff of the strikerwas,50mmabove the
substrate surface. Impact force profiles were measured with a
data sampling rate of,2MHz. For each of the experiment legs,
30 solder joints were tested to ensure statistically meaningful
interpretations of the experiment results.
Results and discussion
Figure 3 shows the cross-sectional views of solder joints near
the substrate pad interface after multiple reflow cycles. The
IMCs on the substrate pad interface after the solder was
etched away are shown in Figure 4. After one-time reflow, a
,5mm thick Cu6Sn5 IMC layer was formed on the interface
as shown in Figure 3(a). Moreover, Ag3Sn IMC was present
in the forms of thin plates inside the solder as well as above
the Cu6Sn5. These Ag3Sn thin plates were best visualized after
the solder had been etched away, as shown in Figure 4(a).
These thin plates had their roots at the interface and radiated
into the solder with different angles. During the solidification
of the solder joints, Ag3Sn, presumably heterogeneously
nucleated at the surface of the soldering pads, grew into the
solders, forming these large, thin plates.
As shown in Figure 3, the thickness of the Cu6Sn5 layer at
the interface increased as the number of reflow cycles
increased. By measuring the thickness of the Cu6Sn5 layer on
the interface at 4-9 locations over the cross-sectioned solder
joint, the average thickness, t, can be fitted as a function of the
number of reflow cycles, n, expressed in the form of t ø
4:35 log nþ 4:63 (mm), for which the correlation parameter
r2 ¼ 0.982.
With an increasing number of reflows, the morphology of the
Cu6Sn5 IMC turned from layer to scallop after three reflow
cycles and became columnar after five reflow cycles. After 20
reflow cycles, the Cu6Sn5 columns apparently merged at the
valleys. In Figure 3(e), it can also be observed that a thin layer of
Cu3Sn became clearly visible beneath Cu6Sn5 after 20 reflows.
The fact that Cu3Sn was observed only when Cu6Sn5 had

Box plots of measured Fmax, Er, d, and Kr corresponding to
different reflow cycles are shown in Figures 6-9, respectively.
In a box plot, the square denotes the mean value, the box is
bounded by lower and upper quartiles, the whiskers extend to
5th and 95th percentiles, and the crosses stand for maximum
and minimum values.
Clearly from the figures we note that, regardless of the two
substrates from different suppliers, as the number of reflow
cycles increases, Fmax, Er, and d decrease gradually while Kr in
general increases gradually. These trends in general indicate
that as the interfacial IMC layer(s) become thicker and the
shape of IMC layer(s) varies with respect to an increasing
number of reflow cycles, the durability of the solder joints
against high-speed shearing loads degrades (with smaller Fmax
and Er) and structural responses of the solder joints become
stiffer and more brittle (with greater Kr and smaller d). The
decrease of peak force with respect to the increase of reflow
cycles was also reported in a conventional ball shear test with a
shearing speed of 0.2mm/s (Koo and Jung, 2005). Specifically,
substantial reductions of Fmax and Er can be observed over
the first three reflow cycles while after five reflow cycles their
magnitudes do not appear to decrease significantly.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
A schematic drawing of the flip-chip structure
used in this study is shown in Fig. 1. On the chip
side, an outer under bump metallization (UBM)
layer composed of 3 lm of Ni was in direct contact
with a 95Pb-5Sn solder bump. The 95Pb-5Sn solder
was electroplated onto the Ni layer and then
reflowed at 350C to form a spherical bump with a
nominal diameter of 95 lm.
The top metal layer on the soldering pads was
electroplated Cu. The pre-solder was screen-printed
over this Cu layer. The mass ratio of the 95Pb-5Sn
solder in the solder bump relative to the 37Pb-63Sn
content in the screen-printed solder paste was 16:5.
In this mass ratio, these two solders, when com-
pletely mixed, would from in an alloy with an
overall composition of 81Pb-19Sn.
The flip-chip assembly in this study was reflowed
between one and ten times. The reflow during
which the 37Pb-63Sn solder paste first became
molten and the substrate was bonded to the chip
was considered the first reflow. The reflow used to
form the 95Pb-5Sn solder bump was not counted.
Each reflow lasted 115 s, during which time the
solder was molten and the peak reflow temperature
was 240 ± 2C. The nominal ramp and cooling rates
were both 1.5C/s.
The first reflow was monitored by a stereo optical
microscope to establish the melting process. After
soldering was completed, the solder joints were
mounted in epoxy and metallographically polished
to reveal the interface and the internal microstruc-
ture. Image analysis software was used to measure
the thickness of the layer of intermetallic com-
pounds. The thickness of each layer was defined as
the total area occupied by the intermetallic com-
pound divided by the linear length of the interface.
A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to
examine the reaction zone for each solder joint,
and a state-of-the-art field-emission electron probe
microanalyzer (FE-EPMA, JEOL JXA-8500F,
Tokyo, Japan) operated at 12 keV was used to
identify the composition of the reaction products.
During the microprobe measurement, Ka, La, and La
x-rays were detected for Cu, Ag, and Sn, respec-
tively. In the microprobe analysis, the concentra-
tions of each of these elements were measured
independently, and the total weight percentage was
within 100 ± 1 wt.% in each case. For every data
point, at least four measurements were made, and
the average value is reported.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In Situ Reflow Observation
Figure 2 shows the sequence of events during the
first reflow, observed through a stereo microscope.
The temperature and the time are shown at the
upper-left and upper-right corners, respectively.
The sample temperature was 31C when the reflow
started, as shown in Fig. 2a. The bright spheres
represent the 95Pb-5Sn solder bumps, and the dark
regions immediately below the spheres represent
the 37Pb-63Sn solder paste. Figure 2b shows the
microstructure 1 s before the solder paste began to
melt; the temperature at this point was 181C.
Figure 2c shows the exact moment when the tem-
perature reached the eutectic point and when the
solder paste started to melt. Because the solidus
temperature of the high-lead solder bump was
higher, the solder bump remained solid. As the
solder paste became molten, its color changed
from a dark color to that of shiny liquid metal. After
another second, the molten 37Pb-63Sn was dis-
placed slightly to the side of the solid bumps, the
standoff (i.e., the vertical distance between the
chip and substrate) decreased, and the molten
37Pb-63Sn climbed up the side of the solder-bump
spheres, as shown in Fig. 2d. The temperature at
this point was 185C. When the peak reflow tem-
perature was reached, the molten 37Pb-63Sn clim-
bed even higher up the side of the solder-bump
spheres, as shown in Fig. 2e. When the reflow
ended, the standoff was the same as that at the peak
reflow temperature, as shown in Fig. 2f.
Closer examination of the solidified solder joints
revealed that the height to which the 37Pb-63Sn
solder ascended along the 95Pb-5Sn solder bump
sphere was uneven. Figure 3 shows that the shape
of the solidified 37Pb-63Sn solder was similar to
that of a calyx (i.e., a cup-like structure) wrapped
around the high-lead solder bump sphere.
Cross-Sectional Observation
In this study, the flip-chip assembly had 45 solder
bumps for the first outer row of solder joints. The
cross-sectional microstructures from the first outer
Fig. 1. Schematic drawing showing a 95Pb-5Sn solder bump placed
over a 37Pb-63Sn pre-solder before assembly. Under the situation
that the 95Pb-5Sn in the solder bump and the 37Pb-63Sn content in
the printed solder paste are completely mixed, the overall composi-
tion will be 81Pb-19Sn.

but they were skewed to the right. The schematic
drawing shown in Fig. 5 helps clarify the difference
in joint shapes. The solder bumps were perfectly
aligned with the pre-solder on the substrate before
reflow, as shown in Fig. 5a. During reflow, as
the oven temperature increased, the chip and the
substrate expanded. The difference in the coefficient
of thermal expansion between the silicon chip
(a = 2.6 ppm/C) and the chip-carrier substrate
(a = 15 ppm/C) caused the substrate to expand
more than the chip. Consequently, the soldering
pads on the chip side became misaligned with the
substrate, as shown in Fig. 5b. When the oven
temperature rose beyond the eutectic temperature,
the solder paste melted and climbed up along the
high-lead solder bump, as shown in Fig. 5c. During
the cooling stage, the molten solder solidified, and
the substrate contracted and slightly deformed the
solder joints. These processes resulted in the final
joint shapes shown in Fig. 5d.

package.

the middle row after one to ten reflows. The result
shows that the middle row of the chip and the first
outer row of the chip have a similar microstructure,
indicating that the thermal history near the center
of the packages was not very different from that
near the edges of the packages.
As the number of reflows increased, gaps between
the UBM and the solder developed in some of the
solder joints, as shown in Fig. 4m and p. Magnified
views of these gaps are shown in Fig. 7. This phe-
nomenon was attributed to the dewetting caused by
the molten 37Pb-63Sn, which climbed high enough
to reach the chip side, as illustrated schematically
in Fig. 8. After the first reflow, the molten solder
only reached about half the height of the high-lead
solder bump, as illustrated in Fig. 8a. As the num-
ber of reflows increased, the tip of the molten solder
climbed continuously higher and eventually reached
the UBM/solder interface, as illustrated in Fig. 8b.
As the number of reflows continued to increase, the
molten solder penetrated into the interface between
the UBM and 95Pb-5Sn, as illustrated in Fig. 8c.
During the cooling stage, the molten solder solidi-
fied, which was accompanied by a volume contrac-
tion. Because the bulk of the heat was drawn away
from the substrate side, the molten solder solidified
near the substrate side first. The last remaining
molten solder was the solder near the UBM. The
volume contraction occurred at the location of
the last remaining molten solder (i.e., the tip of the
calyx near the chip side), causing the formation
of the gaps shown in Fig. 7. The formation of
these gaps caused serious reliability concerns
because the tip of the gap can serve as a site for the
