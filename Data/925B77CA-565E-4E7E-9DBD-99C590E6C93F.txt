英文摘要 
Silicon dioxide thin films have superior characteristics in low dielectric, low 
thermal conductivity, high thermal resistance, optical transparency, and 
anti-diffusive of moisture/oxygen. This project uses silicon dioxide thin film 
as the thermal and diffusive barrier layer of flexible plastic substrate of COC 
polymer, to improve the shortcomings in thermal resistance and moisture 
diffusive for general flexible plastic substrate. Two major researching topics 
discussed in this project are: 1. thermal resistance experiments under ambient 
temperature and vacuum environment for different film thicknesses and using 
infrared thermography to measure the surface temperatures; 2. moisture 
diffusive experiments to measure the diffusivity of moisture and to examine 
the thickness effects on moisture diffusive.

Abstract. A nano-porous silicon film deposited on a flexible cyclic olefin copolymers substrate is 
adopted to insulate the structure at high processing temperature during device manufacturing. In this 
study, the thermal conductivity of nano-porous silicon film modeled by Lysenko et al. [7] is 
implement to do the one-dimensional heat conduction analysis and to calculate the temperatures 
theoretically and numerically. In numerical work, the COMSOL finite-element based package is 
used for the numerical computations and effects of applied temperature loading, thickness of nano-
porous silicon layer, and porosity are discussed. As shown in the analysis results, thickness of 
200µm has the lowest temperature than other thicknesses, 25µm, 50µm, and 100µm, etc. Porosity 
plays a vital effect for thermal insulation. From the analyses, the case of 80% porosity has the larger 
temperature decrement than cases of 40% and 60%. It may be attributed to the lower conduction by 
higher porosity. Also, these temperatures show good agreement between the theoretical and 
numerical results and are consistent to the Lysenko et al. [7] statement for nano-porous silicon film 
for thermal insulating material. 
Introduction 
Use of flexible plastic substrate in flat panel display manufacturing encountered three challenges [1-
3]: 1. plastic substrates like PES and PET can’t sustain processing temperature higher than 350K; 2. 
characteristic of thermal expansion is severe in  glass substrate and incurs alignment difficulty in 
optics; 3. moisture contents and permeations through the substrate for plastic materials are higher 
than glass substrate, which require some barrier layers on plastic substrate to eliminate these issues. 
Furthermore, to reduce dielectric characteristics, one of the effective way is doping micro/nano 
voids into material. If voids are uniformly distributed, dielectric constant is inversely proportional 
to porosity.  The cyclo olefin copolymer (COC) is amorphous and possesses high Tg (max. 2208C) 
[3]. The cyclo olefin monomer can undergo additional polymerization by a suitable metallocene 
catalyst. In addition, the COC also possesses high transparency, high Tg, low moisture absorption, 
and a low dielectric constant. Properties of a typical COC product of Mitsui Chemicals Inc. 
(APEL®) can be found in [3]. 
The thermal conductivity of thin film is known as different that of bulk material due to the 
scattering of phonons at the boundary with the substrate. It depends on the film thickness as well as 
the fabrication method [4]. The thermal conduction issue should be worse in porous materials than 
in condensed materials. If the distribution of pores in the porous material is uniform, the dielectric 
constant is known to decrease approximately linearly with porosity [5]. The 3ω method was an AC 
technique for measuring the thermal conductivity of bulk amorphous solids and crystals, as well as 
amorphous films in the temperature range from 30 to 750 K [6]. Recently discovered phenomenon 
of extremely low thermal conductivity of nano-porous silicon (nano-PS) is used as a barrier layer 
for flexible plastic substrate [7]. When porous-silicon is sintered, the sintered state of porous-silicon 
appears to be particularly important for applications, since sintering is unavoidable if porous-silicon 
is processed at temperatures above 350°C [8]. Free standing single-crystal thin film samples with 
porosities between 27% and 66% are analyzed [8]. The observed thermal conductivities range from 
21 to 2.3W/(mK) and decrease with increasing porosity.  Wuu et al. [9] investigated the 
characterization of silicon oxide (SiO2) films on polyethersulfone (PES) substrates by plasma-
enhanced chemical vapor deposition for transparent barrier applications. Low-pressure microwave

equivalent thermal circuit 
For modeling steady-state temperatures numerically, the COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS 3.2 finite-
element based package was adopted to do the computations, along with proper boundary conditions. 
Geometrical dimensions were set according to the given structure. Meshes were generated by the 
built-in function of this package. According to the physical properties obtained from Eq. (10), 
numerical analyses were conducted. Convergence of iterations for temperature is reached if the 
convergent criterion is satisfied. All the computations were carried out on a Pentium IV personal 
computer with 1GB RAM.  
Thermal Conductivity of Nano-Porous Silicon. To ensure an efficient thermal isolation of 
microsensors, a porous silicon layer with low thermal conductivity should be thick and 
mechanically stable. In the thermal conductivity model of Lysenko et al. [7], by assuming that heat 
transfer in nano-porous silicon occurs only through the Si nano-crystallites and not through the 
pores, total thermal conductivity of a nano-porous silicon layer, nano PSk − , can be defined as: 
( )31nano PS effk k φ− = − ,                                                    ( 4 ) 
where effk is the effective thermal conductivity of an individual Si nano-crystallite, φ is the layer 
porosity. Considering that the phonons scatter at an effective length, effλ , a notion of effective 
thermal conductivity of a single crystallite can be introduced:

Porosity and Thickness Effects. To ensure an efficient thermal isolation of microsensors, a 
porous-silicon layer with low thermal conductivity should be thick and mechanically stable [7]. In 
this study, a variety of nano-porous silicon film structures with three volume percentages of 
porosity, 40%, 60%, and 80%, respectively, are analyzed. As shown in Fig.3(a) and Table 1, in the 
case of 80% porosity and 600K surface temperature loading, the temperature differences can 
increase from 14% to  38% when thickness is increasing from 25µm to 200µm, respectively, and in 
the case of 80% porosity and 700K surface temperature loading, the temperature differences can 
increase from 16% to 43.3% when thickness is increasing from 25µm to 200µm, respectively. 
However, if porosity is decreasing from 80% to 40% for the case of 25µm of COC thermal isolation 
film under 600K of thermal loading on the exterior film surface, the relative temperature is 
decreasing from 14% to 1%, and for the case of 25µm of COC thermal isolation film under 700K of 
thermal loading on the exterior film surface, the relative temperature is decreasing from 16% to 1%. 
In the case of 200µm of COC thermal isolation film under 600K of thermal loading on the exterior 
film surface, the relative temperature is decreasing from 38% to 6.8%, and in the case of 200µm of 
COC thermal isolation film under 700K of thermal loading on the exterior film surface, relative 
temperatures are decreasing from 43.3% to 7.7%. These results are consistent with the Lysenko et. 
al [7] statement for nano-porous silicon film for thermal insulating material.

ABSTRACT 
Plastic substrates for organic light-emitting devices (OLED) 
are extremely sensitive to moisture and oxygen. A new 
amorphous engineering thermoplastic, nominated cyclic olefin 
copolymer (COC) has been used for this application, because 
of higher transparence, lower birefringence, lower dispersion 
and lower water absorption. However, COC plastic substrates 
can’t sustain plasma-based processing temperatures at 350℃. 
In this study, experiments of the moisture permeation rate 
testing and the thermal resistance experiments are conducted to 
explore the moisture diffusion barrier and thermal barrier 
characteristics of COC substrate deposited a SiO2 thin film on 
it. Silicon dioxide layer of thickness, 0.25μm, 0.5μm, and 1μm, 
respectively, are fabricated by PECVD. For the permeation rate 
measurement, the Ca-test method is adopted. For the thermal 
resistance measurements, two methods of the thermocouple in 
vacuum environment and the IR thermography are adopted and 
measured results are compared. Different surface temperatures, 
323.15K, 373.15K, 408.15K, and 473.15K, respectively, are 
applied upon the silicon dioxide film and temperature 
differences for varied thickness of silicon dioxide film are 
measured. Experimental results are presented to investigate the 
behaviors of moisture diffusion barrier and thermal barrier 
characteristics of the COC/SiO2 structure.

INTRODUCTION 
Organic light-emitting devices (OLED) are extremely 
sensitive to moisture and oxygen. Without high-performance 
hermetic seals, the life of these devices is limited. Recently, 
OLEDs have been fabricated on plastic substrates to form 
flexible organic light-emitting diodes (FOLEDs) [1,2,3]. Yu et 
al. [1] developed a novel flexible organic light emitting diodes 
(OLEDs) substrate by simple annealing treatment on the cyclic 
olefin copolymer (COC). The use of flexible substrates will 
significantly reduce the weight of flat panel displays and 
provide the ability to conform, bend or roll a display into any 
shape. Moreover, it will open up the possibility of fabricating 
displays by a continuous roll processing, thus providing the 
basis for cost-effective mass production. However, one major 
drawback of plastic substrate to the application of flexible 
OLEDs is the high permeation rate of water vapor. To achieve 
an operating lifetime in excess of a few tens of hours, however, 
isolation of the OLEDs from atmospheric H2O is necessary.

Moisture Permeation Measurement 
For the moisture permeation measurement, a fixture is 
designed and manufactured to conduct water vapor 
transmission rate (WVTR) experiments. The specimen of 
COC/SiO2 structure is silicone sealed into the cavity of fixture 
and the whole testing fixture is put inside a temperature and 
humidity controlled testing facility (JIA-605W). Humidity 
conditions are set for three levels, 60%RH, 75%RH, and 
90%RH, respectively, at 60℃ environment and testing time is 
24hrs. Inside the fixture cavity, CaCl2 is used to absorb the 
moisture permeate through the specimen into the cavity. The 
flux is then obtained from the weight increment due to the 
absorbed vapor. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) is 
easily calculated by  
( ) 2 22 224 10/ W hr cmP g day m A day mΔ• = × ×            (1) 
where ΔW(g/hr) is weigh increment of CaCl2 and A(cm2) is the 
area of specimen.  
Thermal Resistance Measurement 
For the heat conduction measurement, both of the 
thermocouple (contact type) and IR thermography (non-contact 
type) are adopted to measure the COC surface temperatures if 
different surface temperatures, 323.15K, 373.15K, 408.15K, 
and 473.15K, respectively, are applied upon the silicon dioxide 
surface. And effects of thickness variation of silicon dioxide 
films are investigated. By the Fourier’s law, the total 
resistance, totR , of the structure composed of the silicon oxide 
film and the COC substrates equal to the summation of the total 
internal resistance [10] of two layers of the structure, which is 
expressed by

1k is the thermal conductivity of 
the silicon dioxide film, and 
2k  is the thermal conductivity of 
the COC substrate. The set up and procedures of temperature 
experiments are shown as follows. 
Thermocouple in Vacuum. As shown in Fig. 3(a), 
temperature measurements by thermocouples in vacuum are 
achieved by the following test facilities. It consist five major 
parts, the COC/SiO2 specimen, vacuum chamber, pumping 
system, pressure gauges and mass flow meters, and data 
acquisition system, respectively. The vacuum chamber is a 
SUS304 closed cylinder with 200mm in diameter and 280mm 
in height. To maintain a high-vacuum inside the chamber, all 
flanges are CF sealed and all fittings are SWAGLOG type. The 
pumping system includes a mechanical pump and a diffusion 
pump, respectively, to achieve a vacuum higher than 10-6 Torr. 
Vacuum pressures are indicated by a convectron gauge in 
1atm~10-3 Torr and an ion gauge in 10-3 ~10-7 Torr. A set of 
mass flow meter/controller (0~20SLM) is installed to adjust the 
vacuum in the chamber. To evaluate the leakage of this system, 
pump-down test is conducted. It is obvious to note that vacuum 
of this system is stable after one hour of pump-down, and the 
vacuum pressure is below 77.6 10−× Torr.  
To measure the temperature responses of COC/SiO2 
specimen in a vacuum condition, two electrical feedthroughs 
are installed on the flanges of chamber to supply and to control 
a constant heating power inside the vacuum chamber. The 
schematic of test rig is shown in Fig.3(b). DC power is 
supplied through the right feedthrough and a K-type 
thermocouple for temperature control is connected to the same 
one. Temperatures are measured by the T-type thermocouples 
connected to the left feedthrough and signals are transmitted 
through the feedthrough to a data logger outside the vacuum 
chamber. The measurement procedures are outlined as follows: 
1. Pumping down to base pressure < 77.6 10−× Torr; 
2. PID adjustment of temperature controller to maintain the 
deviation ≦±0.1℃; 
3. Set the temperature in controller and wait for the 
stabilization of temperature; 
4. Record the COC/SiO2 temperature every second for 10min.

IR Thermography. The measurement method for full 
plane temperature distribution in heat transfer applications is 
based on the infrared thermography; this technique was applied 
 5 Copyright © 2008 by ASME 
methodologies of the thermocouple in vacuum and IR 
thermography. 
Considering the case of applied constant temperature 
323.15K, as shown in Fig. 6, triangular and circular symbols 
represent temperatures measured by two different measurement 
technologies, and interpolated straight lines are drawn, also. 
The largest temperature differences (in the case of 1μm SiO2 
film), T1-T2, for two technologies, thermocouple in vacuum 
and IR thermography, are 1.37K and 1.76K, respectively, and 
these values are the same as the slopes of the interpolated 
straight line. Temperature differences are proportional to the 
thickness of SiO2 in a linear manner and the same for both 
measurement technologies of thermocouple in vacuum and IR 
thermography. Also, the measured temperatures by the 
thermocouple in vacuum method are lower than by the IR 
thermogrphic method always. As shown in Fig. 7, in the case of 
constant applied temperature 373.15K, the largest temperature 
differences (in the case of 1μm SiO2 film), T1-T2, for these two 
technologies are 1.83K and 3.98K, respectively, and these 
values are the same as the slopes of the interpolated straight 
line. Temperature differences are proportional to the thickness 
of SiO2 in a linear manner and transition in slope is noticeable. 
It can be noted that the measured temperature difference by IR 
thermographic technology is higher than the measurement by 
the thermocouple in vacuum technique. This may be attributed 
to the fact that, due to the appreciable thickness effect, heat loss 
through the side walls and optical reflection and refraction 
increased as film thickness is increased. As shown in Fig. 8, in 
the case of constant applied temperature 408.15K, the largest 
temperature differences (in the case of 1μm SiO2 film), T1-T2, 
for these two technologies are 2.76K and 4.95K, respectively. 
Transition in slope is noticeable as in 373.15K testing condition 
and this temperature condition, 408.15K, is closed to the glass 
transition temperature of COC. As usual, the measured 
temperature differences by IR thermographic technology are 
higher than the measured one by the technique of 
thermocouples in vacuum. Finally, as shown in Fig. 9, in the 
case of constant applied temperature 473.15K, the largest 
temperature difference (in the case of 1μm SiO2 film), T1-T2, 
for these two technologies is 1.51K and 3.16K, respectively. 
Lower temperature deviations than the case of 408.15K is 
noticeable. Moreover, it can be noted that the measured 
temperatures by IR thermographic technology is lower than the 
measurements by the thermocouple in vacuum technique. This 
may be attributed to the fact that, due to the applied 
temperature loading is higher than the glass transition 
temperature of 408.15K, material properties and molecule 
structures of COC may changed to an unpredictable properties 
and structures which makes this measurement unpredictable. 
The measured temperature differences of COC/SiO2 
structure are listed in Table 2. It is clear to note that, for 
thermocouple in vacuum measurement, thickness of SiO2 films 
is effective up to 0.78% (323.15K) if thickness is increased to 
1μm SiO2 film, and, for IR thermographic measurement, 
thickness of SiO2 films is effective up to 1.2% (373.15K) if 
thickness is increased to 1μm SiO2 film. According to the 
measurements, characteristics of thermal insulation and 
moisture permeation of a COC substrate are enhanced by 
deposition of a silicon dioxide film.

Abstract 
Plastic substrates for organic light-emitting devices (OLED) are extremely 
sensitive to moisture and oxygen. On the basis of higher transparence, lower 
birefringence, lower dispersion and lower water absorption, a new amorphous 
engineering thermoplastic, nominated cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) has been 
used for this application. However, COC plastic substrates can’t sustain plasma-
based processing temperatures at 350℃. This study is focus on two important 
topics regarding to measurements of the permeation rate and thermal resistance of 
a SiO2 layer structure deposited upon the COC substrate. Silicon dioxide layer of 
thickness, 0.25μm, 0.5μm, and 1μm, respectively, are fabricated by PECVD. For 
the permeation rate measurement, the Ca-test method is adopted. For the thermal 
resistance measurements, both of the thermocouple in atmosphere and the IR 
thermographic methods are adopted and measured results are compared. Different 
surface temperatures, 323.15K, 373.15K, 408.15K, and 473.15K, respectively, are 
applied upon the silicon dioxide film and temperature differences for varied 
thickness of silicon dioxide film are measured. Experimental results are presented 
to investigate the behaviors of moisture diffusion barrier and thermal barrier 
characteristics of the COC/SiO2 structure.

1.1 Introduction 
Organic light-emitting devices (OLED) are extremely sensitive to moisture and 
oxygen. Recently, OLEDs have been fabricated on plastic substrates to form 
flexible organic light-emitting diodes (FOLEDs) [1,2,3]. Yu et al. [1] developed a 
novel flexible organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) substrate by simple annealing 
treatment on the cyclic olefin copolymer (COC). The use of flexible substrates will 
significantly reduce the weight of flat panel displays and provide the ability to 
conform, bend or roll a display into any shape. However, one major drawback of 
plastic substrate to the application of flexible OLEDs is the high permeation rate of 
Experimental measurements for moisture permeations and thermal resistances of cyclo 
olefin copolymer substrates 3 
surface of cyclic olefin copolymers (COC) [15].  
This study is focus on two important topics regarding to measurements of the 
permeation rate and thermal resistance of a SiO2 thin film layer deposited upon the 
COC substrate. For the permeation rate measurement, the Ca-test method is 
adopted. For the thermal resistance measurements, two methods of the 
thermocouple in atmosphere and the IR thermography are adopted and measured 
results are compared. The target of this study is to investigate the behaviors of 
moisture diffusion barrier and thermal barrier characteristics of the COC/SiO2 
structure. 
1.2 Experimental Apparatus 
In this study, experiment of the moisture permeation rate testing and the thermal 
resistance experiments are conducted to explore the moisture diffusion barrier and 
thermal barrier characteristics of COC substrate deposited a SiO2 thin film on it. 
For the permeation rate measurement, the Ca-test method is adopted. For the 
thermal resistance measurements, both of the thermocouple in atmosphere and the 
IR thermographic methods are adopted. Detailed descriptions of these experimental 
apparatus and procedures are discussed as follows. 
1.2.1 Sample Preparation 
The substrate material used in this study is cyclo olefin copolymer (COC) modeled 
APEL APL5014DP. The glass transition temperature is 135℃. The particles are 
baked by an oven at 90℃ for a period of time. Then hot-embossing on a machine 
into a flat sheet of 200μm in thickness and annealed in a vacuum oven to achieve 
the high transparency property. After that, dipping in the ultrasonic ethanol bath for 
one minute and rinse by deionized water and then dried by the dry nitrogen to 
clean the particles and organics resided on the substrate surface. In this study, the 
silicon dioxide film is deposited on the cyclo olefin copolymer (COC) substrate by 
PECVD. The process gases are TMS (10 SCCM) and O2 (199.7 SCCM). 
Processing conditions are at 300mTorr of vacuum pressure and at 50W of RF 
power. As shown in Fig. 1.1, three different thicknesses of silicon dioxide films, 
0.25μm, 0.5μm, 1μm, respectively, are fabricated on the top of the COC substrate. 
The processing times are approximated to 5min, 11min, and 22min, respectively. 
The surface morphologies of test specimens are measured by the atomic force 
microscopy, and roughness Ra is approximated to 2.2nm before deposition and to 
7.8nm after deposition.

1.1.1.2 IR Thermography 
The measurement method for full plane temperature distribution in heat transfer 
applications is based on the infrared thermography; this technique was applied in 
many different works and offers many advantages. At first the system is not 
intrusive and the apparatus set-up time is not expensive particularly with respect to 
typical measurement method like the naphthalene sublimation. The principle of the 
IR thermography is the measurement of the amount of IR radiation, which is 
absorbed (or emitted) by a sample as a function of the wavelength. The IR 
measurement can be carried out in the modality of transmission or reflectance, 
being the first one the most popular. 
Fig. 1.3 shows a schematic of the experimental setup. The COC/SiO2 structure is 
placed in an enclosure, the heating power is supplied, and the camera is installed 
above. The micro-bolometer IR camera used is a NEC Thermo Tracer TH9100WL 
that records 60 frames per second with a 320x240 resolution and two operating 
ranges, -40 ℃ ~120 ℃ and 0 ℃ ~500 ℃ , in resolution ± 0.2 ℃ . The detection 
wavelength is in the range of 8~14μm. Focusing range is from 30cm to infinite. 
Emissivity of COC is calibrated by standard procedure. The IEEE1394 interface is 
used to connect to PC for image storage. The measurement procedures are: 
1. PID adjustment of temperature controller to maintain the deviation ≦±0.1℃; 
2. Calibrate the emissivity of COC; 
3. Set the temperature in controller and wait for the stabilization of temperature; 
4. Record the COC thermographic images every five second for 10min. 
measurement duration; 
5. Load the thermographic images into PC and processed by image processing 
software to find the averaged temperature.

Considering the case of applied constant temperature 323.15K, as shown in Fig. 
1.4, square and circular symbols represent temperatures measured by two different 
measurement technologies, and interpolated straight lines are drawn, also. The 
largest temperature differences (in the case of 1μm SiO2 film), T1-T2, for two 
technologies, thermocouple in atmosphere and IR thermography, are 1.32K and 
1.76K, respectively, and these values are the same as the slopes of the interpolated 
straight line. Temperature difference is proportional to the thickness of SiO2 in a 
linear manner and the same for both measurement technologies of thermocouple in 
atmosphere and IR thermography. Also, the measured temperatures by the

It is clear to note that, for thermocouple in atmosphere measurement, thickness of 
SiO2 films is effective up to 1.0% (373.15K) if thickness is increased to 1μm SiO2 
film, and, for IR thermographic measurement, thickness of SiO2 films is effective 
up to 1.2% (373.15K) if thickness is increased to 1μm SiO2 film. According to the 
measurements, characteristics of thermal insulation and moisture permeation of a 
COC substrate are enhanced by deposition of a silicon dioxide film. 
1.4 Conclusions 
This study is focus on two important topics regarding to measurements of the 
permeation rate and thermal resistance of a SiO2 layer structure deposited upon the 
COC substrate. Silicon dioxide layer of thickness, 0.25μm, 0.5μm, and 1μm, 
respectively, are fabricated by PECVD. For the permeation rate measurement, the 
Ca-test method is adopted. For the thermal resistance measurements, two methods 
of the thermocouple in atmosphere environment and the IR thermography are 
adopted and measured results are compared. Different surface temperatures, 
323.15K, 373.15K, 408.15K, and 473.15K, respectively, are applied upon the 
silicon dioxide film and temperature differences for varied thickness of silicon 
dioxide film are measured. Experimental results are presented to investigate the 
behaviors of moisture diffusion barrier and thermal barrier characteristics of the 
COC/SiO2 structure. For the moisture permeation experiments, the measured 
permeation of COC substrate is 2.77 g/day-m2. And after deposited by the PECVD 
process a silicon dioxide layer of thickness of 0.25um, 0.5um, and 1um, 
respectively, the measured permeation is decreased to 0.858~0.386 g/day-m2 
(under 60C, 90%RH). Compared these values to the permeation of glass substrate, 
1.7 g/day-m2, reduction in permeability is in 49.5%~77.3%. For the heat 
conduction measurements, for thermocouple in atmosphere measurement, 
thickness of SiO2 films is effective up to 1% (373.15K) if thickness is increased to

英 文 摘 要 
Plastic substrate for flat-panel-display is flexible, light weight, and sustainable to 
bending deflection, and is a candidate to substitute the glass substrate. However, use of 
flexible plastic substrate in flat panel display manufacturing encountered two challenges: 1. 
moisture contents and permeations through the substrate for plastic materials are higher than 
glass substrate; 2. plastic substrates can’t sustain high processing temperatures. In this thesis, 
a silicon dioxide thin-film layer is deposited on the cyclo olefin copolymer (COC) substrate to 
investigate the moisture permeation, the heat conduction, and the optical characteristics 
experimentally. 
For the moisture permeation experiments, the measured permeation of COC substrate is 
2.77 g/day-m2. And after deposited by the PECVD process a silicon dioxide layer of thickness 
of 0.25um, 0.5um, and 1um, respectively, the measured permeation is decreased to 
0.858~0.386 g/day-m2 (under 60C, 90%RH). Compared these values to the permeation of 
glass substrate, 1.7 g/day-m2, reduction in permeability is in 49.5%~77.3%. 
For the heat conduction measurements, both of the thermocouples and IR thermography 
are adopted to measure the COC surface temperatures if different surface temperatures, 
323.15K, 373.15K, 408.15K, and 473.15K, respectively, are applied upon the silicon dioxide 
surface. And effects of varied thickness of silicon dioxide film are explored. Temperature 
differences of COC substrate are measured to be in the range of 0.15%~0.4% for different 
technologies. With the deposition of silicon dioxide film (1um thickness), temperature 
differences is increased to 1% (about 3~5K). According to the measurements, characteristics 
of thermal insulation and moisture permeation of a COC substrate are enhanced by a silicon 
dioxide film deposition. 
From the optical experiments, transmissivity is significant to thickness of silicon dioxide 
film, and reversed results are found in optical problem than in conduction/permeation 
problems. In the case of 1um thickness, transmissivity of the compoed structure is decrease to 
88.3%, this is not meet the specification of 90% transmissivity for plastic substrate. But, if 
deposited thickness less than 0.5um, transmissivity is measured to be higher than 90%.
