Abstract– In the study, a robust nonlinear L∞−gain output
feedback tracking control design for robotic systems is proposed
under persistent bounded disturbances. The design objective is
to find a reduced-order observer-based controller such that the
peak of the tracking error in time domain must be as small as
possible under persistent bounded disturbances. Since the non-
linear L∞ − gain optimal tracking control for robotic systems
can not be solved directly, the nonlinear L∞ − gain optimal
tracking problem is transformed into a nonlinear L∞ − gain
tracking problem by giving a desired (prescribed) disturbance
attenuation level for the L∞−gain tracking performance. The
proposed robust L∞ − gain controller is based on a reduced-
order observer, which is constructed to estimate the velocity
signal only and whose dimension is half of the dimension of
robotic systems, and is suitable for practical control design of
robotic systems.
Keywords: robust L∞−gain tracking control, reduced-order
observer, output feedback, persistent bounded disturbances,
and robotic systems.
I. Introduction
In recent years, the trajectory tracking control of
robotic manipulators has received considerable attention
because of its potential applications in industry. Several
approaches have been introduced to deal with the tracking
control problem of robotic manipulators. The technique
of feedback linearization of nonlinear systems provides an
alternative way to the tracking control of robotic systems,
which is also called computed torque method [1], [2]. This
method provided a control law separated into two parts
: one is a nonlinear state feedback to cancel exactly the
nonlinear terms and factors, and the other is based on
some techniques of linear control design for the linearized
systems. On the other hand, for LQ optimal tracking
control, Johansson [3] has studied the optimal motion
control with the minimization of the applied torque by
finding an explicit solution to the corresponding Hamilton-
Jacobi equation from H2 optimization point of view. How-
ever, the LQ optimal tracking control does not guarantee
the robustness in the face of exogenous disturbances. In
practical robotic systems, however, external disturbances
are inevitable. The H∞ (or L2−gain) optimal control has
been widely discussed for its robustness in stability and
its capability of disturbance attenuation [4], [5].
In general, H∞ optimal control is to minimize the sys-
tem gain from the energy point of view, i.e., the exogenous
disturbance should belong to L2 space. Therefore H∞
optimal tracking control design can not be applied to the
systems with persistent bounded disturbance which does
not belong to L2 space. In this situation, L∞ − gain (or
L1) optimal control scheme has been introduced to deal
with the rejection of persistent bounded disturbance with
the concern of minimizing the peak of tracking error [6].
Recently, L∞ − gain (or L1) optimal control has been
developed for the linear systems to eliminate the peak
of tracking error due to the eﬀect of the persistent bound
exogenous disturbances [7], [8], [9]. In most case, it is more
appealing for control engineers because they are more care
about the maximum amplitude of tracking error than the
energy of the tracking error. In the L∞−gain (L1) optimal
control design for the linear systems, the duality theory
and linear programming techniques have been proposed
to deal with this optimal design problem by solving a
set of linear equations [6], [7], [8]. This approach is very
complicated, especially for the high-order MIMO systems
and may not lead easily to a finite-dimensional linear
programming problem for some cases [10]. On the other
hand, for the nonlinear systems, the L∞ − gain control
problem is more diﬃcult to be solved [11]. At present,
there are no eﬃcient algorithms to solve the L∞ − gain
control problem for the nonlinear dynamic systems. In this
situation, more eﬀort is needed to develop the nonlinear
L∞−gain tracking control for the robotic tracking control
systems because they are inherently nonlinear systems.
Unfortunately, the need for velocity feedback shows
one drawback of state feedback control methods since in
practice velocity measurements by tachometers are often
contaminated with a considerable amount of noise and
are frequently omitted due to the considerable saving in
cost, volume, and weight [12]. There are many approaches
which relate to the output (position) feedback problem of
tracking control in robot motion via full-order observer
and substituting (8) into (7), the error dynamics (7) can
be rewritten as
s˙2 = M
−1(q)[−C(q, q˙)s2 + δ˜(s1, qd, q˙d)s˜2
−s1 − k0(s2 − s˜2) + τd] + ps˜2 (11)
where
δ˜(s1, qd, q˙d) = C(s1 + qd, ps1 − q˙d)
Then, the error dynamics for the observation error s˜2 is
obtained as follows
.
s˜2 = M
−1(q)[−C(q, q˙)s2 + δ˜(s1, qd, q˙d)s˜2 + τd]
+(p− k1)s˜2 (12)
C. Problem Formulation with L∞ − gain Tracking Per-
formance
The optimal L∞ − gain robotic output feedback
control problem is to specify a observer-based control
input τ in (1) such that the following minimax problem
is achieved for robotic systems.
min
τ
sup
τd(t)∈L∞
nη(t)n∞
nτd(t)n∞
(13)
where error vector η(t) =

s1(t) s2(t) s˜2(t)
T
.
However, it is very diﬃcult to solve the minimax prob-
lem in (13) for the robotic systems directly, the following
tracking control problem for a prescribed attenuation level
is proposed in this study.
L∞ − gain robotic output feedback control problem:
Considering the nonlinear robotic tracking dynamic sys-
tem, given a desired (prescribed) disturbance attenuation
level ρ, the L∞ − gain robotic output feedback control
problem is said to be solved if there exists a observer-
based control law τ such that the following L∞ − gain
tracking performance with η(0) 9= 0
nη(t)n∞ ≤ β |η(0)|+ ρ nτd(t)n∞ (14)
can be achieved for some β > 0.
Assumption2: In this study, it is assumed that not only
τd(t) ∈ L∞ but also its bound is exactly known, i.e.,
nτd(t)n∞ ≤ τ¯d.
IV. Robust L∞ − gain Tracking Control for Robotic
Systems
In this section, a main result is provided for the
L∞ − gain output feedback control problems. First, a
useful Lemma is stated below.
Lemma 1: : If a real scalar function ω(t) satisfies the
following diﬀerential inequality
ω˙(t) ≤ −βω(t) + υ(t) (15)
where β > 0, then
ω(t) = e−βtω(0) +
] t
0
e−βτυ(t− τ)dτ (16)
Proof: The proof is trivial.
Then, we have the following main result.
Theorem 1: : For the robotic systems in (1), if controller
and observer are chosen as that in (8) and (9), respectively,
and if

for some a1 > 0, a2 > 0, and a3 > 0; the initial
conditions |q(0)− qd(0)| ≤ c1, |q˙(0)− q˙d(0)| ≤ c2; the
initial condition of observer dynamics is chosen as
z(0) = −k1(q(0)− qd(0))− a0
where a0 is any vector satisfying |a0| ≤ c3; and η(0) ∈
Ω0, then η(t) ∈ Ω and the following L∞ − gain tracking
performance
nη(t)n∞ ≤ β |η(0)|+ ρ nτd(t)n∞ (19)

, it is obvious that
|s1|2 ≤ 2V (η(0)) + ρ0

|s2|2 ≤ 2

V (η(0)) +
ρ0
p
nτd(t)n2∞
|s˜2|2 ≤ 2V (η(0)) + ρ0
p
nτd(t)n2∞
Hence, if initial condition η(0) ∈ Ω0, then
V (η(0)) ≤ Vmax (41)
This implies that
|s1|2 ≤ 2Vmax + ρ0
p
nτd(t)n2∞
|s2|2 ≤ 2

Vmax +
ρ0
p
nτd(t)n2∞
|s˜2|2 ≤ 2Vmax + ρ0
p
nτd(t)n2∞ (42)
for all t ≥ 0. Therefore, the trajectory η(t) starting in Ω0
remains within Ω ⊇ Ω0. This completes the proof.
V. Simulation Example
The parameter matrices for a two-link
planar robotic manipulator are assumed to
be M(q) =

M11(q2) M12(q2)
M12(q2) M22(q2)

, C(q, q˙) =

−m2l1l2c sin(q2)q˙2 −m2l1l2c sin(q2)(q˙1 + q˙2)
m2l1l2c sin(q2)q˙1 0

and G(q) =

0 0
T
, where q = [ q1, q2 ]T ,
M11(q2) = m1l
2
1c+m2l
2
1+m2l
2
2c+2m2l1l2c cos(q2)+I1+I2,
M12(q2) = m2l
2
2c + m2l1l2c cos(q2) + I2, and
M22(q2) = m2l
2
2c + I2. The parameters of the
robotic manipulator are given as m1 = 2.6125(kg),
m2 = 3.45(kg), l1 = 0.3(m), l1c = 0.178(m), l2c = 0.2(m),
I1 = 0.1977(kgm
2), and I2 = 0.1840(kgm
2). Therefore,
the upper bound of MM = 1.6 and Mm = 0.09
and CM = 0.4 (thus PM = 1.6, Pm = 0.09, and
β =
t
PM
Pm
= 4.2164) can be found. Simply let a1 = 5,
p = 3, c1 = c2 = c3 = 2, and a0 = 0.5. If ρ = 0.5 is given
in advance, then ρ0 = 2ppmρ
2. For the convenience of
design, let a2 = a3 and then a2 = a3 =
t
M2m+1
4ρ0M2m
can be
assigned according to (27). The external disturbances are
assumed to be τd1 = 0.5 sin(10t) and τd2 = 0.5 cos(10t)
(thus τ¯d = 0.5). The desired reference trajectories
are qd = [ q1d, q2d ]
T = [ sin(t), cos(t) ]T (thus
r0 = r1 = 1). The initial conditions q(0) = [ 0, 1 ]
T ,
q˙(0) = [ 0, 0 ]T are assumed. For steady-state (i.e.,
t ≥ 12),
nη(t)n∞
nτd(t)n∞

The trajectories of position tracking error q1 − q1d and
q2 − q2d are shown in Fig. 1, while the trajectories of

VI. Conclusions
In this paper, a reduced-order observer-based con-
troller for the L∞−gain tracking performance is developed
in robotic systems under persistent bounded disturbances.
A dynamic feedback controller is proposed to achieve the
L∞ − gain tracking control design for robotic systems
using position measurements only. In this study, a novel
approach for the robust L∞ − gain tracking output
feedback control problem of robotic systems is provided.
Obviously, the proposed control scheme is useful for the
tracking design in robotic systems with persistent bounded
disturbances.

B. Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)  
The employed ANFIS containing six layers is shown in 
Fig. 2. The system has three inputs 
1 2 3, , and e ix Q x fem x R= = = , and one output y. There are 
three nodes in Layer 1 that pass the three input signals to the 
next layer. Because the value of no-load voltage fem  has 
much more variation on a complete discharge cycle than 
both the extracted charge eQ  and the input resistance iR , 
and the value of the extracted charge eQ  has almost no 
variation, so we choose that the input 1x has only one 
membership function, the input 2x has nine membership 
functions, and the input 3x has two membership functions 
associated with them, respectively. This selection leads to 12 
nodes in Layer 2. Each node in this layer acts as 
membership function  ( ),j
i

xμ  and its output specifies the 
degree to which the given ix  satisfies the quantifier 
j
iA . 
Here we choose the membership function to be a Gaussian 
function as (1).

IV. REAL-TIME ESTIMATION USING SIMULINK 
In order to build the SoC estimator, the trained parameters 
of the ANFIS are needed to know. In addition to plotting the 
trained membership functions as shown in Fig. 8, the 
MATLAB program in Fig. 6 also reports these parameters as 
executed [12]. The trained parameters of the Gaussian-type 
membership functions and 18 Sugeno fuzzy rules are 
summarized as Table I and  Table II, respectively. These 
trained parameters are then used to create an estimation 
model for the real-time estimation of the SoC of a Li-ion 
battery under test.

Fig. 1 The equivalent circuit of a photovoltaic array. 
is an equivalent shunt resistance, Rs is an equivalent series 
resistance, ipv and vpv are the output current and output voltage 
of PV array, respectively. 
In general, for simplicity Rsh and Rs are assumed to be open 
circuit and short circuit, respectively. The simplified 
mathematical model of the output current is given as

T ： cell surface temperature ( K° ) 
p： cell ideality factor ( p =1~5) 
Pn ： number of solar cells in parallel 
sn ： number of solar cells in series 
In addition, the mathematical model of the reverse saturation 
current is given below:

where 
rT : reference temperature; 
rrI : reverse saturation current at reference temperature; 
gpE : band gap energy ( 1.1 eVgpE ≈ ). 
The current source of PV array, PhI , varied according to 
solar irradiation and cell temperature, is given below: 
100/))(( λrIscPh TTKII −+=                       (3) 
where 
scI : short circuit current at reference temperature and solar 
irradiation; 
IK : short circuit current temperature coefficient at reference 
temperature and solar irradiation; 
λ : solar radiation, irradiation, or insulation (W/m2). 
From (1)-(3), the output power of PV array is expressed as 
follows:

From above, the output power pvP  is determined by solar 
irradiation, cell temperature, and characteristics of PV arrays. 
The purpose of this study is to develop a maximum power 
point tracking (MPPT) controller for the PV arrays. The 
conventional MPPT algorithms use (5) as follows to obtain 
the maximum output power point.

                      (6) 
In other words, if (6) can be achieved then the maximum 
power point tracking is also followed. 
As mentioned above, the output power pvP  is determined 
by solar irradiation, cell temperature, and characteristics of 
PV arrays and so is the derivative with respect to pvv . 
Moreover, the analytic solution of (6) is difficult to obtain 
due to its complexity and nonlinearity. This is the reason why 
it is so difficult to solve the MPPT problem for a PV system. 
III. A NOVEL CONTROL STRUCTURE FOR PV ARRAYS 
WITH MPPT 
By observing (6), the parameters rsI  (reverse saturation 
current), T  (ambient temperature), and p  (cell ideality 
factor) are uncertain terms. Let 0T T T= + Δ , ppp Δ+= 0 , 
rsrsrs III Δ+= 0 , where 0T , 0p , and 0rsI  denote nominal 
terms and TΔ , pΔ , and rsIΔ  denote perturbed terms for T , 
p , and rsI , respectively. Therefore, equation (6) can be 
rewritten as follows:

V. SIMULATIONS 
To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, a 
PV system of 310W, composed of two cascaded solar panels, 
a dc/dc converter, and an output load, is constructed. For 
simplicity of implementation, the neural network 
compensator has two input nodes (i=1,2), three hidden nodes 
(j=1, 2, 3) and one output node only (k=1). The simulation 
block diagram of the proposed MPPT controller for the PV 
system with the buck converter switching frequency of 10 
KHz and neural network updating rate of 100 Hz using 
MATLAB is shown in Fig. 4. 
Simulation conditions: TTT Δ+= 0 , CT

)(sin20 CtT °=Δ ω , λλλ Δ+= 0 , 6000 =λ (W/m2),  
tωλ sin400=Δ  (W/m2), and the ideality factor is assumed to 
be unknown. Normally, the varying frequency ω  is very 
small and it will take a long time for simulations in such a 
case. To speed up the simulation efficiency, 5=ω  (rad/sec) 
is assumed in the simulations. The simulated results are 
shown in Fig. 5. As can be seen, the PV array’s output current, 
voltage and hence the output power are varied due to the    
variations of the ambient temperature and solar irradiation. 
The the proposed controller can still make the tracking error 
)ˆ( 0 xxie pv Δ+−=  approach zero despite of the variation of 
ambient temperature and solar irradiation. This is equivalent 
to achieving MPPT for the PV arrays.

characteristics in PV systems. By the simulation of 
MATLAB and implementation of a DSP TMS320F28335, 
a prototype PV system about 310W with maximum power 
point tracking controller is built in this study. By using 
TMS320F28335, this study develops MPPT controller 
compensated by a neural network for a PV system. From 
experimental results, the validity of the proposed MPPT 
controller has been verified under a certain solar irradiation
