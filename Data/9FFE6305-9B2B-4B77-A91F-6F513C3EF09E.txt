which results in the charge balance between the inner and outer plasmic membrane and leads
to the death of all lives at sufficient quantity (Madigan et al. 1997, Crosby 1998 ).
To remedy the recalcitrant compounds in a contaminated site could be risky in terms of costs
and successfulness. Abiotic methods (Chen et al. 1999) usually result in uncertainty of
by-products after treatment; yet, confidence of treatment success is quite mixed if biotic
methods employed. Overall the abiotic methods are costly, and the biotic methods take time-
could last for decades (Chen and Berthouex 2003). However, it is believed that the biotic
methods are superior in terms of their nature of degradation. Less uncertain by-products and
cheaper are two major causes for employing the biological methods.
To increase the consistency and efficiency of the biological degradation of those recalcitrant
compounds on site, we studied the following objectives: (1) screening the potential affecting
factors that might control target compound degradation, (2) determining the optimal
conditions for the important factors, and (3) studying the degradation kinetics of the optimal
conditions and its degradation patterns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Selected chemicals of the three organic groups, namely PCBs, PAHs, and CPs were studied in
same manner. Table 1 shows the list of the selected target compounds in this study. As for the
polluted medium, two soils from the southern Taiwan were obtained; one has lower organic
content and the other higher. The obtained soils were dried, screened, for some spiked with
target toxins, and stored at 4 oC for later uses. For each sample 15 grams of the pre-treated
soil was treated with design conditions and was sacrificed after a pre-determined time for the
residual target compound analysis via a GC-FID. The initial degradation rate of each target
compound was used to assess the treatment effectiveness caused by each factor or their
combinations.
As for the factor screening, six factors (i.e., soil toxin content, glucose addition, sludge
addition, soil organic content, aerobic/anaerobic treatment, moisture content) were screened
form the literature as the studied factors. Results of some pre-test experiments (data not
shown) plus the consideration of real treatment field conditions excluded the
aerobic/anaerobic factor.
To screen the remaining 5 factors, a 25-1 factional factorial run for each toxin group was
conducted. The results showed that the factors importance varied at different toxin groups.
The positive or negative effectiveness of each factor for each toxin group is given in Table 2.
To reconfirm the factor importance, a second screening test (i.e., a 2x full factorial design,
where x=3 or 4) was conducted for each toxin group. The results, given in Table 3, showed
that the toxin content in soil was the most important for all toxin groups. In
PCBs-contaminated soil the soil organic content was also important. Here, we excluded the
effect of soil organic content in the PCBs case due to little control of the factor in the field and
proceeded to determine the optimal condition for treating each toxin group.
