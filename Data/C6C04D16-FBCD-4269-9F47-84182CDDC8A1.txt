I. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, the interest toward complex robot system is expanding for new 
application topic. An example of such a system is a dexterous manipulator mounted on a 
flexible base. When a robotic manipulator is mounted to a crane, boom or mobile platform, it 
loses its accuracy and speed due to the compliance of the base. We shall refer toThe interest 
toward complex robot system is expanding for new application areas. An example of such a 
system is a dexterous manipulator mounted on a flexible base. We shall refer to such a 
system as flexible structure mounted manipulator system. In literature, such a system is 
known under the name macro-micro system, characterized by the number of control actuators 
being less than the number of state variables [1, 2]. In this problem, the manipulator 
dynamics is strongly affected by nonlinear forces due to the oscillation of the base as well as 
its own nonlinearity; these include gravity, Coriolis, and centrifugal forces, which are 
generally intrinsic to a mechanical system. Therefore, the central issue is how to handle these 
kinds of exogenous nonlinear disturbance in addition to the internal nonlinearity, in the 
presence of dynamic model uncertainties [3]. 
Most of the previous work relating to oscillatory base manipulators falls into the type of 
inertial task space and on external disturbances [4]. The main issues of this kind of problem 
are decoupling of the manipulator and base dynamics and damping the base oscillation, for 
which several approaches have been proposed, such as task-space feedback [5, 6], filtering 
command [7], path planning [6], acceleration feedback [1] and active damping approaches [2, 
8]. Many researchers have addressed control schemes for macro/micro-manipulators. One 
area involves determining trajectories that avoid or minimize induced vibration [9]; however 
the schemes are not useful for controlling the vibration once it occurs. Inertial damping 
scheme using the micromanipulator to damp the vibration is an attractive compromise 
between control system complexity and system performance [8, 10]. Its motion produces 
inertial interactions that can be applied directly to the tip of the micromanipulator. This 
method requires no hardware modifications other than some measurement of the vibration at 
the tip of the micromanipulator. However, all of the above papers never discussed the 
intelligent controller for such structures. Moreover, previous studies have several limitations, 
and have ignored many important issues, such as the interaction of the link and base 
oscillation, inertia uncertainties, and lack of availability of some states, among others.

For the practical application point of view, often one mode (which is coupled with 
translation and rotation) is dominant in structural oscillation. Controlling translation implies 
controlling rotation too. Therefore, the paper focuses on translate oscillation only as an initial 
study. The assumption is the same as the literature shown in [1]. For convenience of 
exposition, consider a special case, a two-link planar elbow arm mounted on an oscillatory 
base and shown in Fig. 2, the case of a two degree of freedom (DOF) manipulator and 
1-DOF base motion, where both the motions of the manipulator and the base are restricted on

III. CONTROLLER DESIGN 
When the joint sensors and actuators of the manipulator are located at the same place, the 
system looks collocated. But it is not collocated, due to the flexibility base. Normally, it is 
very difficult to attach another collocated sensor and actuator to measure and stabilize the 
base flexibility. In general, without the presence of additional sensors, strain gauges, 
accelerometers, and so on, it is assumed that the displacement of the oscillatory base cannot 
be measured. The displacement of the joint angles can be measured if encoders are attached. 
Hence, the difficult problem for such a structure is only one control input τ  has to control 
two variables q and . A class of such robot system is so-called under-actuated systems, 
characterized by the number of control actuators being less than the number of state 
variables. 
bx
Moreover, an exact model of an inertia matrix and nonlinear terms is not available, and 
they vary as the configuration changes. The control objective is to determine the input control 
torque τ  such that the base oscillation  damps out as quickly as possible while the joint 
angle q follows the desired tracking performance. Therefore, find a controller, which 
stabilizes the closed-loop system subjected to structured model uncertainties, attenuates 
disturbance desirably, and satisfies given joint tracking performance objectives is strongly 
desired. Therefore, a special intelligent controller is necessary to meet such a goal.

fulfill the control requirement, which includes pure fuzzy tracking controller (FTC), and fuzzy 
supervisory controller (FSC). Due to the complexity of this two link planar robot mounted on 
an oscillatory base, it decomposes the control task into two subtasks and distributes them over 
two different levels.  
The lower level is a FTC, which controls the robot link to track the desired joint trajectory. 
The lower level controllers only take into account each subsystem ignoring the interactions 
among them. To implement the proposed technique, the lower level is decomposed into two 
subsystems: the first subsystem takes joint tracking error  (1e θθ −= de ) and its derivatives 
 as local variables for link 1 subsystem, while the second subsystem takes  and  as 
local variables for link 2 subsystem, respectively. Therefore, the fuzzy logic controller FLC
1e& 2e 2e&
1 
takes  and  as inputs to generate the local control action u1e 1e& c1, while fuzzy logic 
controller FLC2 takes  and  to take another control action u2e 2e& c2. Thus, at the local level, 
each subsystem is designed separately. The fuzzy logic rule base for each subsystem is 
designed based on the dynamic response of each link when a control force is activated on the 
robot system. 
As was said before, the fundamental reason for decomposing fuzzy systems is to reduce 
the curse of dimensionality. Decomposition leads to a multi-staged structure of several simple, 
interacting subsystems, each having a reduced number of input signals. Each subsystem thus 
has a (significantly) reduced complexity if compared to a single (large) fuzzy system, 
measured in the number of rules and of parameters that have to be stored and processed. 
Moreover, the reduction of rules, which is achievable by decomposition, is maximized if the 
number of inputs per subsystem is two. 
In this investigation, the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has 
been used to optimize the fuzzy IF-THEN rules and the membership functions to derive a 
more efficient fuzzy control. The main idea in the learning procedure is to update the 
membership function and fuzzy rule by using the information from the training patterns, i.e., 
sets of input-output outcomes. The training algorithm is similar to the reference [14, 19]. The 
structure of an ANFIS shown in Fig. 3, which is comprised of the input (layer 1), input 
membership (layer 2), rule (layer 3), output membership (layer 4), and output (layer 5) layers. 
Layer 1 accepts the input variables e and . Layer 2 is used to calculate the membership 
values. The nodes of layer 3 and 4 represent fuzzy rules and output membership values. Layer

3.2.2 Fuzzy Supervisory Controller (FSC) 
In order to guarantee that the robot manipulators does not hitting the constraint sets when 
it movements, the research add a supervisory controller that takes control action in extreme 
situations. The supervisory controller consists of some coordination control rules that take 
actions in the subsystem interactions. Specifically while the idea that dividing the control task 
into multiple levels of coordination or supervision and execution has been widely promoted, 
the issue of how one may design the higher levels within the hierarchy has remained the 
major stumbling block in connection with the design of such system.

the correction factor  takes linguistic values  from the same term set {LN, SN, ZE,

This means that one may use two single-output fuzzy controllers to imitate the behavior of 
a single controller with the same two outputs. By the way, the correction factor , e.g., the 
control action can be given by

computed by applying the max/min composition. The fuzzy system representing the second

The inference process of the system is shown in the rule view of the window of the Fuzzy 
Logic Toolbox in MATLAB. Fig. 6 indicates the 3D plot for the rule surface. Furthermore, Fig. 
7 displays the Rule View window for an exemplary input. Moreover, the fuzzy rule base can 
be illustrated in Table 1.  
The main advantage of hierarchical control with respect to complexity costs is that, once 
a hierarchy has been formulated and a corresponding feedback control structure designed, 
variations of the control objectives to other hierarchy compatible specifications can be 
efficiently realized.  
 
3.3 Composite Control 
A hierarchical fuzzy approach is pursued which allows the modification of a composite 
control strategy. The total (final) control action of the hierarchical fuzzy controller is 
composed of the control actions due to different level set; that is

where  is local controls difference and defines as cu∆ 21 ccc uuu −=∆ . 
Furthermore, the correction factor wi (output scaling factor) is self-regulated during the 
control process, and can optimize the gain for the hierarchical fuzzy controller. Then, a 
suitably designed supervisory unit takes care of coordination the switching among the 
tracking controllers so as to ensure stability in the face of uncertainty.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
An experimental device was designed and constructed to verify both model development 
and controller design. The description of the device is the same as the reference [21]. Fig. 8 
shows the experiment apparatus. The test results are obtained by the aforementioned 
procedures using MATLAB and Simulink. The parameters of the system are given in Table 2. 
Two servomotors are attached to each joint with optical encoders for measuring the position 
 13
link 2 joint angle 2θ  subjected to cosine reference command. From Fig. 9(a), it is seen that 
a pure fuzzy tracking controller (FTC) play well transient tracking performance in the 
simulation. Moreover, Fig. 9(b) shows a tracking response with supervisory control scheme. 
We may view the FTC uc as a lower-level operator and the FSC us as an upper-level 
supervisor. If the tracking controller can perform successful control, the supervisor just 
observes and does not take any action. That is why the response of Fig. 9(a) and 9(b) are 
almost the same.  
To further verify the performance of the controller, the step reference command has been 
applied to the system. Figure 10 displays the tracking response for joint angle 2θ . It can be 
seen that the pure FTC cause a large overshoot during the transition. In such case, the control 
system is subjected to quite severe chattering due the base oscillation. In order to reduce the 
overshoot, the supervisory fuzzy controller has been applied. It can be observed that the Fig. 
10(b) demonstrates that the performance has been significantly improvement for joint angle 
2θ  while the supervisory fuzzy controller applied. The overshoot has been reduced 
considerably. 
Moreover, Fig. 11 illustrates the tracking error for the system subjected to step reference 
command. Fig. 11(a) indicates the tracking response for joint angle 1θ . It demonstrates the 
transient performance very well for the proposed controller. In addition, it also displays very 
little improvement in the joint tracking while applied supervisory fuzzy control. The 
maximum overshoot has been reduced form 0.27 (no supervisory control) to 0.19 (with 
supervisory control). Moreover, from the Fig. 11(a), the steady state error has been reduced 
form 3.1e-3 (no supervisory control) to 2.8e-3.  
Additionally, as seen from Fig. 11(b), the steady state error has been reduced form 2.2e-4 
to 1.54e-4 for link 2 tracking. Furthermore, it also indicates the chattering motion has been 
reduced once supervisory controller was introduced. These results show that not only the 
tracking performance can be achieved but also the control chattering can be eliminated. If for 
some reason the tracking controller cannot control the system well, the supervisor takes 
control actions to prevent catastrophic. During this period, the tracking controller learns to 
collect the mistakes and regains control. After the system is back to normal, the supervisor 
becomes an observer again.  
Moreover, in order to verify the controller’s performance, some of the step pulse input 
 15
controller consists of some coordination control rules that take actions in the subsystem 
interactions. The test results of trajectory tracking have shown that the resulting controller 
attenuates the disturbance from the base and tracks the desired joint trajectory despite the 
parametric perturbation of the manipulator and the variation of the frequency of the base 
oscillation. Consequently, the control design method proposed for this structure is found to 
be promising. Consequently, it is shown that the proposed control model offers several 
implementation advantages such as less on-line computation time, reduced effect of 
overshoot and chattering, and a fast convergent rate in simulation. It should be noted that the 
oscillatory base problems evidently contain common problems, i.e., with non-oscillatory 
bases, as a special class. Therefore, the proposed control methodology is extensively 
applicable to general control problems of mechanical systems.
