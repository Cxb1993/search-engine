Environmental Protection Agency enacted the Clean Air Act Amendment in 1990 and classified 
many VOCs as toxic air pollutants. Common control techniques for VOCs include combustion, 
adsorption, absorption, and condensation processes. While the conventional thermal treatment 
and some advanced oxidation processes have shown greater efficiency in removing VOCs and 
enhancing public safety, they require both larger capital investment and processing costs. Also, 
adsorption and absorption approaches only achieve phase transformation only, rather than 
reduction in quantity or toxicity of the VOCs [2-4].  
Microwave was first applied to heating food. In recent years, its applications have grown 
rapidly in diverse fields such as concentration, extraction and synthesis in chemistry [5-8]. This 
study focused on employing microwave as the source of energy radiating on the catalyst of 
Fe3O4 to treat VOCs such as IPA. Microwave processing technique not only saves time but also 
requires no additional fuel. Thus, it is more environmentally friendly and causes no secondary 
pollution. In this study, a high-temperature combustion system is established by applying 
microwave of 2450 MHz to a catalytic Fe3O4 packed column, which is then employed to destroy 
and remove VOCs in waste gas. Results of this research confirm the feasibility of this approach 
to removal of air pollutants [9] and the treatment system has already been granted a patent (No. 
M309457) in Taiwan [10]. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND MATERIALS 
1. Design of Microwave Catalytic Packed Column 
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the proposed continuous microwave radiation 
(CMWR) system. A household microwave oven (Panasonic Taiwan, NE-R30A) with frequency 
  5
First, the microwave power output was calibrated according to TEPA No. 0910019876 
(Environment Protection Agency, Taiwan). Furthermore, the microwave readout (MD-200, 
Digital readout Co., USA) was employed to monitor leakage of microwave and ensure safety 
during the experiment. When the experiment began, power was turned on and IPA was fed into 
the reactor. The temperature of the Fe3O4 catalytic packed column of different heights was 
measured and recorded automatically (PCLD-8710, Bo-Shine Techno. Co., Taiwan) every 5 
seconds. The concentrations of CO and CO2 in the rear gas after treatment were also monitored 
and recorded (EGA-200, Shine-Joint Techno. Co., Taiwan). In addition, the concentration of IPA 
in the rear gas was analyzed using GC-FID to estimate the destruction and removal efficiency 
(DRE) of IPA. The entire reaction time was set to be 30 min. The power was turned off 
automatically by the timer of the microwave oven upon termination of the experiment, followed 
by natural cooling to room temperature at 25 ± 0.5 °C. All experiments were repeated in 
triplicate under the same conditions. The errors of these experiments were less than ± 4 %.  
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
1. Effect of Microwave Power 
Figure 3a shows the effect of different microwave powers (210-760 W), on temperature 
of the Fe3O4 catalytic packed column. As can be seen, the higher the microwave power is, the 
higher the rate of increase in temperature is, which follows the order of 760 W (1.08 °C s-1) > 
520 W (0.68 °C s-1) > 310 W (0.51 °C s-1) > 210 W (0.35 °C s-1). The result was similar to the 
previous study [11] and confirmed the influence of microwave powers. On the other hand, 
regardless of the microwave power, the temperature of the packed column would gradually reach 
  7
In general, the higher the SV of inflow gas, the shorter gas retention time is. The time 
flowed through the catalyst is relatively less and reduced the opportunities of contact between 
IPA and catalyst. In additional, the greater amount of inflow gas carries away the more surface 
heat of the Fe3O4 catalytic packed column that will result in a cooling effect and produce the 
lower DRE of VOCs [12]. Figure 3b shows the effects of different SVs on temperature of the 
Fe3O4 catalytic packed column. The difference in temperature between SVs of 4080 and 6120 h-1 
is small, as evidenced by the overlapping of the two respective temperature curves. This can be 
attributed to the vertical conductive effect of temperature and the turbulence of the inflow gas, 
which undermines the cooling effect achieved by SV of 6120 h-1. In view of this, the SV of 6120 
h-1 should be chosen in the subsequent experiments. However, in order to avoid the vertical 
conductive effect and the interference of turbulence and consider the stability of the operation, 
the subsequent experiment still selects the SV of 4080 h-1. 
.  
3. Effect of Relative Humidity (RH) 
For most catalytic oxidation processes, too high RH will result in active radicals on the 
surface of catalyst being covered by water molecules, which will in turn inhibit catalytic activity 
and reduce treatment efficiency [13,14]. In this study, with SV of 4080 h-1 and microwave power 
of 760 W, air dehumidified by dehydrated reagent (RH < 3 %) and normal air (RH at 60-75 % in 
Taiwan) were fed into the reaction system to examine the effect of RH on temperature of the 
Fe3O4 catalytic packed column.  According to the results, RH showed no significant influence on 
increase in temperature of the packed column (Fig. 3c). For this phenomenon, the reasonable 
inference is that Fe3O4 was an efficient absorbent for microwaves and it did not keep moisture 
similar as activated carbon absorbed. Therefore, Fe3O4 adsorbed microwave rapidly and 
  9
initial 2 min when the power was just turned on. While the concentration of CO2 was about 340 
ppmv, that of CO was less than 5 ppmv and hence undetected by the instrument (≤ 5 ppmv).  
However, the concentrations of both CO and CO2 increased when IPA was thermal oxidized by 
the microwave/Fe3O4 system. The increase in concentration of CO2 from the initial background 
concentration of 348 ppmv to 5940 ppmv was more marked than that of CO, which rose to 31 
ppmv within first 10 min and then decreased to about 19 ppmv. Calculating the mass balance of 
IPA also evidenced the same result, i.e., IPA was thermal oxidized mostly into CO2 and small 
traces of CO. The concentration of oxygen was maintained within 18-19% v/v throughout the 
experiment. The results obtained show that the supply of oxygen was sufficient during the 
reaction, which facilitate the thermal oxidation of IPA by the microwave/Fe3O4 system. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, microwave power and SV of inflow gas were more significant parameters 
affecting temperature. The higher the microwave power is, the greater the rate of increase in 
temperature and the higher the thermal balance temperature are. Moreover, higher SV of inflow 
gas carries away more heat from the catalytic packed column, leading to greater decrease in 
temperature. In sum, the application of the microwave/Fe3O4 system to catalytic destruction and 
removal of IPA promises a new technology for treatment of VOCs. The time required for 
temperature rise is short, with the reaction system reaching 800-900 °C within 10-15 min. Such 
temperature exceeds the ignition point of most VOCs and can thus rapidly destroy and remove 
VOCs in waste gases. The increase in temperature requires no extra fuel added, and both 
operation and maintenance are easy. As long as the VOC concentration is controlled to be less 
than 25% of the lowest explosion level, the system does not present any operation and safety
