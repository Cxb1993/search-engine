1 INTRODUCTION
We consider the joint economic-statistical design
of X¯ and R control charts, assuming that the
distribution of the quality characteristic measure-
ment X is nonnormal and the distribution of the
in-control time is Weibull. Specifically we assume
that X has a Johnson distribution (Johnson et al.
1994) with mean µ, standard deviation σ, skew-
ness α3, and kurtosis α4. In practice, assignable
causes such as aging effects of wear may result in
a shift of the process mean or process variance
or both. We assume that the process is sub-
ject to two assignable causes of variation. The
first assignable cause shifts the mean from µ0 to
µ0 + δσ0, δ ∈ R, while the second assignable
cause shifts the standard deviation from σ0 to
γσ0, γ > 1. Occurrences of these two assignable
causes are independent. The X¯ and R control
charts are used jointly to maintain current con-
trol of the process. The upper and lower control
limits of the X¯ chart for samples of size n are
µ0±k1σ0/
√
n, where k1 > 0. For the R chart, the
upper control limit is k2σ0, k2 > 0, and the lower
control limit is set to zero for simplicity. To use X¯
and R control charts, four parameters—the sam-
ple size n, time h between successive samples,
and factors k1 and k2—must be determined. In
an economic-statistical design, the four parame-
ters are chosen so that the expected cost per hour
is minimized under constraints on Type I and II
error probabilities.
There is extensive literature on the joint
design of X¯ and R control charts. Saniga
(1989) develops the economic-statistical design
for Shewhart-type control charts and has applied
it to the joint determination of the parameters
of X¯ and R charts. The quality characteristic
measurement and in-control time are assumed to
have normal and exponential distributions, re-
spectively. McWilliams et al. (2001) present a
FORTRAN code to jointly determine the para-
meters of X¯ charts used together with either R
or S charts under non-Markovian shock mod-
els. They assume that the occurrence of the
assignable cause results in a simultaneous shift in
the process mean and process variance. Rahim
and Costa (2000) developed a model for the joint
economic design of X¯ and R charts, assuming
that the occurrence times of assignable causes
are independent and follow Weibull distributions
with increasing failure rates. The quality char-
acteristic is assumed to be normally distributed.
The renewal theory approach is used to obtain
the expected cycle length and expected cost.
Some nonnormal literature exists. Lashkari
and Rahim (1982) consider the CUSUM chart,
and Nagendra and Rai (1971) and Rahim (1985)
consider the economic design of X¯ charts. All
of this work models the probability density func-
tion of the quality measurement X by the first
four terms of the Edgeworth series, where the
four terms are functions of the first four mo-
ments. The normal distribution is a special case
of Edgeworth series. Burr (1967), Yourstone and
Zimmer (1992) and Chou et al. (2000) model
the distribution of X¯ as a Burr distribution using
the moment method. The advantage of the Burr
distribution is that it has a closed-form cdf (cu-
mulative distribution function), which simplifies
computations of the Type I and II error probabil-
ities. The disadvantage, however, is that because
the Burr distribution is right skewed, unlike the
Edgeworth series, it strictly limits X¯ to a non-
normal distribution.
This research considers the joint economic
statistical design to minimize the cost of con-
trol charts while keeping reasonable Type I and
II error probabilities. We extend the Costa cost
model so that the quality characteristic measure-
mentX and the in-control time have Johnson and
Weibull distributions, respectively. The Weibull
distribution has advantages of having many dis-
tribution shapes (including exponential), a non-
constant hazard rate function, and a closed-form
cdf. Furthermore, in practice, the product char-
acteristic measurement may not follow a normal
distribution. We choose the Johnson distribu-
tion family for a wide range of the skewness and
kurtosis (see the Appendix). The Johnson fam-
ily (including normal, lognormal, bounded, and
unbounded types) covers the entire feasible part
of the (β1, β2) plane, where β1 stands for the
squared skewness and β2 the kurtosis (Johnson
et al., 1994, pages 29 and 687).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we discuss the cost function and
constraints under the Johnson and Weibull as-
sumptions. In Section 3, we perform sensitiv-
ity analysis to study the effects of nonnormality,
Weibull shape, and shift on the optimal parame-
ters.
2 THE COST MODEL
Our cost model is an extension of Costa (1993)
by assuming that the quality characteristic mea-
1
process variance shifts is
p2 = P
{
|X¯ − µ0| > k1σ0/
√
n or
R > k2σ0 |µ = µ0, σ = γσ0
}
(3)
and the joint power when both the process mean
and variance shift is
p3 = P
{
|X¯ − µ0| > k1σ0/
√
n or
R > k2σ0 |µ = µ0 + δσ0, σ = γσ0
}
. (4)
When variance goes out of control before
assignable cause 1 is detected, ETM is
A2 =
∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=0 [(t + 1)h − τ1 + τ2](1 −
p1)t+1
{
FT1 [(m+1)h]−FT1(mh)
}{
FT2 [(m+ t+
2)h] − FT2 [(m + t + 1)h]
}
. Now consider Case
(ii). Obviously ETM is zero. For Case (iii),
if the mean shifts before the variance, ETM
is then A3 =
∑∞
m=0
∫ (m+1)h
mh
∫ (m+1)h
t1 (t2 −
t1)fT2(t2)fT1(t1)dt2dt1. Therefore, the expected
total time that only the mean is out of control is
TX = A1 +A2 +A3.
Computations of TR is analogous to compu-
tations of TX . By interchanging subscripts 1 and
2 in the formulas of A1, A2, and A3, we have B1,
B2, and B3, respectively. The expected time that
only the variance is out of control is then TR =
B1+B2+B3, where B1 =
∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=0 [(t+1)h−
τ2] (1− p2)t p2
{
FT2 [(m+1)h]−FT2(mh)
}{

FT1 [(m + t + 1)h]
}
,, B2 =
∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=0 [(t +
1)h − τ2 + τ1](1 − p2)t+1
{
FT2 [(m + 1)h] −
FT2(mh)
}{
FT1 [(m + t + 2)h] − FT1 [(m + t +
1)h]
}
, and B3 =
∑∞
m=0
∫ (m+1)h
mh
∫ (m+1)h
t2 (t1 −
t2)fT1(t1)fT2(t2)dt1dt2.
Computation of TXR, the expected time that
both the process mean and variance are out
of control (abbreviated as ETMV), also con-
sists of three parts. For Case (i), when the
variance goes out of control before assignable
cause 1 is detected, ETMV equals C1 =∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=0 [h/p3 − τ2](1 − p1)t+1
{
FT1 [(m +
1)h]− FT1(mh)
}{
FT2 [(m + t+ 2)h]− FT2 [(m +
t + 1)h]
}
. Analogous to Case (i), if the mean
goes out of control before assignable cause 2
is detected in Case (ii), ETMV equals C2 =∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=0 [h/p3 − τ1](1 − p2)t+1
{
FT2 [(m +
1)h]− FT2(mh)
}{
FT1 [(m + t+ 2)h]− FT1 [(m +
t + 1)h]
}
. For Case (iii), ETMV equals C3a if
the mean shifts before the variance and C3b,
otherwise, where C3a =
∑∞
m=0 E[(m + 1)h −
T2 | mh < T1 < T2 < (m + 1)h] P{mh <
T1 < T2 < (m + 1)h} +
∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=1(t −
1)h(1 − p3)t+1 p3 P{mh < T1 < T2 <
(m + 1)h} =
∑∞
m=0
∫ (m+1)h
mh
∫ (m+1)h
t1 [(m +
1)h − t2]fT1(t1)fT2(t2)dt2dt1 +
∑∞
m=0 h(1/p3 −
1) P{mh < T1 < T2 < (m + 1)h}, and C3b =∑∞
m=0 E[(m + 1)h − T1 | mh < T2 < T1 <
(m + 1)h] P{mh < T2 < T1 < (m + 1)h} +∑∞
m=0
∑∞
t=1(t− 1)h(1− p3)t+1 p3 P{mh < T2 <
T1 < (m + 1)h} =
∑∞
m=0
∫ (m+1)h
mh
∫ t1
mh[(m +
1)h − t1]fT1(t1)fT2(t2)dt2dt1 +
∑∞
m=0 h(1/p3 −
1) P{mh < T2 < T1 < (m+ 1)h}. Therefore, the
total expected time that both mean and variance
shift is TXR = C1 + C2 + C3a + C3b.
There are costs associated with each part of
the cycle time. The cost C of the entire cycle in-
cludes the cost of nonconformities (while in con-
trol and out of control), sampling, process repair,
and false alarms. Specifically,
E(C) = V0
[
(1/λ)1/θΓ(1 + 1/θ)
]
+ V1TX
+V2TR + V3TXR
+(a1 + a2n)[(1/λ)1/θΓ(1 + 1/θ)
+TX + TR + TXR]/h+ a3 + a4αs,
where V0, V1, V2, and V3 are the hourly cost due
to nonconformities produced while the process is
in control, only the process mean is out of con-
trol, only the process variance is out of control,
and both the mean and variance are out of con-
trol, respectively. Constants a1 and a2 represent
the fixed and variable costs per sampling, respec-
tively; a3 represents the expected cost required
to locate and eliminate the assignable cause 1
and/or 2; a4 represents the expected search cost
for each false alarm.
The hourly nonconformity costs V0, V1, V2,
and V3 depend on the defective rate. In this work,
we let these values proportional to the defective
rate, defined as P{|X − µ0| > 3.5σ0}. Specifi-
cally, we set V0 = 1000 P{|X − µ0| > 3.5σ0|µ =
µ0, σ = σ0}, V1 = 1000P{|X − µ0| > 3.5σ0|µ =
µ0 + δσ0, σ = σ0}, V2 = 1000P{|X − µ0| >
3.5σ0|µ = µ0, σ = γσ0}, and V3 = 1000P{|X −
µ0| > 3.5σ0|µ = µ0 + δσ0, σ = γσ0}. Therefore,
each .001 increase in the defective rate increases
the expected hourly cost by one dollar. The mul-
tipliers 1000, associated with the defect cost, and
3.5, associated with the tolerance limits, are user-
specified constants and are chosen arbitrarily.

and λ2 change from “λ1 < λ2” to “λ1 > λ2”. For
all three Johnson shapes, this change causes that
n∗ and k∗1 decrease and that h∗ increases as δ =
1 and decreases as δ = 2. The effect on k∗2 de-
pends on the population distribution shape. The
value of k∗2 remains the same for (α3, α4) = (2,
6), increases for (α3, α4) = (5, 100), and does not
change monotonically for (α3, α4) = (2, 10.8634).
These effects can be explained as follows. When
λ1 increases, assignable cause 1 occurs more fre-
quently than assignable cause 2, and hence, k∗1
decreases. (Similarly, when λ2 increases, k∗2 de-
creases.) Furthermore, the variance in the hourly
cost decreases and therefore, n∗ decreases.
Finally, consider the effect of nonnormality.
Comparing the three Johnson shapes, we see that
nonnormality affects the values of n∗, h∗, k∗1 , and
k∗2 . The optimal parameters are sensitive to kur-
tosis α4. For skewness 2, n∗ and k∗1 decrease as α4
increases. Chen and Cheng (2005) show that in
an economic-statistical design with a small skew-
ness, α and β increase as the kurtosis increases,
and hence, n∗ and k∗1 vary monotonically with
respect to α4.
Table 1 also illustrates comparisons of the
fully economic and economic-statistical designs.
When r1 = r2 = 1, the economic-statistical de-
sign is called the fully economic design because
of no limits on Type I and Type II error proba-
bilities. When the upper bounds (r1 and r2) of α
and β decrease, the mean hourly cost increases.
In our empirical results, the fully economic de-
sign has the lowest cost but the Type II error
probability can be as high as .3 (unshown in the
table). By controlling α and β under .1, the in-
crease in the mean hourly cost is less than 10%.
Hence, we conclude that economic-statistical de-
sign is superior.
