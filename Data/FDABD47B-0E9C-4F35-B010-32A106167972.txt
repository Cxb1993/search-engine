simulation results demonstrated that the thermal lesion can be accumulated at 
different depths of 9cm and 6cm by using appropriate number of transducers and 
sonication modes. 
 
II. Methodology 
 
1. Acoustic field calculation 
A continuous wave model is utilized in the ultrasonic field calculation for the 
proposed cylindrical phased-array transducer of the breast tumor treatment. The 
acoustic field generated by the ultrasound transducer can be calculated by using the 
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld integral to sum up the contribution from every point source on 
the surface of the transducer. For every unit area dS, there is a surface vibration 
velocity u. The acoustic pressure field of any point in the space is calculated by 
summing up the element pressure contribution of every unit area and can be expressed 
as

                 (1)  
where p(x,y,z) is the acoustic pressure at point r = (x,y,z), r’ is the location of the point 
source dS on the surface of the transducer, ρ is the density of the medium, c is the 
acoustic speed of the medium, k is the wavenumber, u is the complex surface velocity 
of the point source, and α is the attenuation coefficient of the medium. The acoustic 
pressure p(x,y,z) is in a complex form. It is difficult to solve equation (1) in its closed 
form, so a two-dimensional discrete integration is used for the numerical solutions. 
Assume the phased-array transducer is composed of finite N by M small grid 
elements. Equation (1) can be expressed as

where ΔxΔy is the area of the point source nm, unm
 
 is the surface velocity of the 
point source nm.  
According to previous studies, ultrasound attenuation in the medium is mainly 
caused by the absorption effect of the medium. So the scattering effect is neglected in 
this study and the acoustic absorption coefficient of the breast is assumed to be equal 
to the attenuation coefficient. The relation between the power intensity of the field 
(W/cm2) I and the calculated pressure field p is

Fig. 2. The arrangement of transducers for a target region at the depth of 9 cm. (a) The 
width of intercostal muscles and ribs is 15mm [4]. The height of the ribs is 10mm and 
the skin depth is 1mm. (b) Liver and skin will be taken into account in simulation. 
Each transducer was placed 15o apart from each other. 
 
Fig. 4(a) demonstrates the normalized sound pressure patterns of each mode at 
the depth of 9 cm beneath the skin when five transducers are used in the experimental 
configuration shown in Fig. 2. Every normalized sound pressure pattern is represented 
by a specific color. It can be observed that the combined pressure pattern covers the 
area from -2 cm to 2 cm along the X-direction. Therefore, it is supposed that if the six 
modes are switched during a thermal ablation in the breath-hold condition, a 
continuous thermal dose (TD) distribution can be obtained in the X-direction. Using a 
strategy with the six modes switched at a frequency 10 Hz and the five transducers 
driven at the same power intensity of 4 W/cm2
 
, a lesion at 9-cm depth can be formed. 
Fig. 4(b) shows the accumulated thermal dose distribution in the X-Z and the X-Y 
planes in the breath-hold condition. The contours from the innermost to the outermost 
represent the thermal dose of 240, 100, and 10 minutes at 43℃, respectively. Fig. 4(c) 
shows the temperature distribution after the thermal treatment. The contours represent 
the temperature of 70, 65, 60, 55, 50 and 43 ℃ from innermost to outermost, 
respectively. The maximum temperature in the tissue is 70.18℃.  
To investigate the effects of different driving patterns of a fixed total acoustic 
power intensity, four power intensity levels and heating time are applied to calculate 
the thermal dose distribution. Let the total power intensity equal to 48 W/cm2, the four 
driving patters are 1 W/cm2 for 48 seconds, 2 W/cm2 for 24 seconds, 3 W/cm2 for 16 
seconds, and 4 W/cm2 
 
for 12 seconds. Six modes are switched at 10Hz for the five 
transducers during the treatment.

In the EOE treatment, three combinations of acoustic power intensity and 
heating time are used to investigate their effects on thermal dose distribution while the 
total power intensity remains the same. The driving patterns are 2W/cm2 for 30 
seconds,  3W/cm2 for 20 secones and 4W/cm2
 
 for 15 seconds. 
Table 3 shows the results of the maximum temperatures of tissue and skin in the 
three driving conditions. It is observed that when the acoustic power intensity is 
greater than 3 W/cm2, the maximum tissue temperature can be over 60 ℃. Therefore, 
3 W/cm2 for 20 seconds and 4 W/cm2 
 
for 15 seconds were used for the multiple 
heatings with different initial temperatures to form a large lesion with EOE gating.

Fig. 10 shows the thermal dose distribution after five heatings at the depth of 9 
cm under the skin with EOE gating. Fig. 10(a)(b) are the results for acoustic power 
intensity of 3 W/cm2 for 20 seconds and Fig. 10(c)(d) shows the results of 4 
W/cm2 for 15 seconds. The order of target position is Y = 0 mm, 2 mm, -2 mm, 4 mm, 
and -4mm. After the first treatment, the following treatment does not start until the 
temperature of the previous treatment decreases to the initional temperature setting of 
37℃ or 43℃. Each heating terminates when the temperature reaches the peak 
temareture of the first heating. 
     
 
Fig. 10. Accumulated thermal dose distributions for the X-Z, Y-Z and X-Y planes 
after five heatings with the acoustic power intensities of 3W/cm2 for 20 seconds and 
4W/cm2 for 15 seconds at the depth of 9 cm below the skin, EOE gating. Different 
initial conditions (I.C.) are compared. (a)3W/cm2, I.C. = 37℃, (b) 3W/cm2, I.C. = 43
℃, (c) 4W/cm2, I.C. = 37℃, (d) 4W/cm2
 
, I.C. = 43℃. 
The above results showed that the thermal dose accumulated along the motion 
direction caused by the breath (X-direction). Using multiple heating with the 
transducers moved in the Y direction, the thermal lesion up to 1cm3 could be formed 
for both situations of breath-hold and end-of-exhale. 
 
3. Treatment of multiple planning target volumes at 6-cm depth, breath-holding 
When the liver tumor lies at different depth beneath the skin, the number and 
arrangement of transducers can be adjusted so that the ultrasound beams will not be 
blocked by the ribs and the focus can locate at the desired position. Take the depth of 
6 cm for example, Fig. 11 shows the settings.  
 
The same methodology and procedures stated previously for tumors located at 
the depth of 9cm can be used for the new situation. By using the Pseudo inverse 
method, four focusing modes can be determined and each mode has different phase 
difference of 0°, 180°, 96°, and -96°, respectively.  
 
The transducers are placed at different positions in the order of Y = 0 mm, 2 
mm, -2 mm, 4 mm, and -4mm to make the accumulated thermal dose distribution 
cover the planning target volume. Driving power intensities of 1 W/cm2 for 48 
seconds and 4 W/cm2
 
 for 12 seconds are used.
