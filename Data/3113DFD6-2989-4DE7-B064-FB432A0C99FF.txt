Abstract
Based on the nonlinear observer theory, in the first part of this research a novel virtual
sensing approach for on-line estimation of important process variables of the injection
molding was proposed. An on-machine evaluation positively demonstrated the effectiveness
of the melt flow virtual sensing during the filling stage. Meanwhile, an iterative learning
molding control was also developed. With the learning control, the reliability of an existing
injection machine was significantly improved. Specifically, a 70% reduction in part-weight
variation was attained in a twin-plate molding.
In the second part of this research, we took an initiative to investigate how to bring the
new micro/nano molding ideas, such as capillary molding, contact printing, etc., to practical
engineering use. Based on the results obtained, four patents are currently under review by
both Taiwan and US patent offices. As a result, the report of these results will be deferred to a
later time.

11. Background and Objective
Due to the economy of mass production, varieties of molding processes have been used
in production from low-end plastic products in 70's to electronic packaging and 3C thin-wall
parts in 90's. Nowadays, we are witnessing production of molding prototypes with
millimeter to micron features or in such size. Furthermore, with the continuous expansion of
possibilities, precision and quality become two increasingly important concerns in molding
industry. However, when called to address these new challenges of this new millennium,
existent molding approaches and their associated controls immediately see their limitations.
For example, a serious deficiency exists in the architecture adopted by current molding
controls when we attempt to extend them to address the quality concern. Although many
efforts have been devoted to understanding how process variables determine part qualities,
notably the pvT data, the process variables have never been directly regulated. Instead of
regulating process variables directly, all existing molding controls are designed to regulate
machine variables, which in most situations behave quite differently from the corresponding
process variables. As a result, quality and precision of the molded parts are compromised.
Pertaining to molding of micro featured and micro sized parts, several modifications to
standard injection molding process have been proposed. The most notably is the micro
injection molding introduced in late ‘80s for manufacturing millimeter-scale micro parts.
Injection-compression molding represents a successful effort to produce micron featured parts,
e.g. CD disks. From the opposite extreme, several interesting micro/nano molding approaches
(e.g. capillary molding, contact printing, nanoimprinting, etc.) have been proposed, thanks to
the fast-pace progress in the nanotechnology. With promising results widely reported in the
science literature, how to refine and modify these micro/nano molding ideas to make them
become useful engineering tools seems the logical focus of next-phase research and
development.
Addressing these needs for quality and precision molding and molding of micro featured
and micro sized parts, a long-term research program was established three years ago. Its
objectives are to develop new intelligent control approaches aimed at quality and precision
molding and to conduct further research and development in order to bring the above
mentioned new micro/nano molding ideas to practical engineering use. The past year
represented the third year effort of this long-term research endeavor. In the following, we
describe the approach and summarize results of the program obtained so far. However, we
would like to apologize first that because four patents on new micro/nano molding are under
review, only results on intelligent molding control will be reported here

Design of the two-input virtual sensor
In this design, both the screw position x and nozzle pressure P2 are used as the
measurement inputs. The use of P2 allows for a certain degree of “decoupling”in the virtual
sensor design. Specifically, treating P2 as an input, the dynamics of the injection screw Eq. 1
can be separated from the remaining flow dynamics Eq.s 2 to 4.
Adopting the same state vector as defined in above single-input virtual sensor, the
two-input virtual sensor design was accomplished by first designing a linear Luenburger
observer [9] for screw position and velocity

measurable using hardware sensors. Consequently, screw velocity control is adopted in lieu of
melt front velocity control. If the virtual sensor such as the proposed two-input one could
effectively estimate the melt front position, a genuine melt front velocity control can be
realized to help maintain uniform cavity filling, resulting in reduced internal stress in the
molded parts.

3.2. Accomplishment in Iterative Learning Molding Control
An iterative learning molding control, consisting of both filling and packing learning
controls and a switchover logic, was designed and evaluated on the same injection molding
machine VS-50 with the same twin thin-plate mold (Figure 3). The design details can be
found in [3] and a patent on the designed learning molding control has been awarded [11].
Effectiveness of the filling leaning control was evident in Figure 9, showing the screw
position response approaching the desired trajectory gradually cycle after cycle. Figures 10
and 11 show the convergence of maximal and RMS tracking errors as injection continued
cyclically in screw position tracking during filling and in hydraulic pressure tracking during
packing/holding, respectively. The good tracking performance resulted in good consistency in
the weights of molded plates. The standard deviation in weights of the plates molded under
the learning control was reduced to 0.98 mg compared to the 3.26 mg under existing machine
controller, a significant 70% improvement (Figure 12).

4. Conclusion
One objective of this project was aimed at addressing the increasingly demanding
precision and quality requirements on molding production from a control engineering point of
view. In particular, it was focused on the development of appropriate software-based virtual
sensors and learning control with application to the injection molding process. Specifically, a
promising virtual sensing approach for injection molding was proposed and showed great
potential via an on-machine evaluation. In addition, an iterative learning-based molding
control was designed and demonstrated superior performance improvement over the existing
machine controller.
The other objective of the project was to conduct research and development to bring the
new micro and nano molding ideas, such as capillary molding, contact printing, and
nanoimprinting, to practical engineering use. This effort has resulted in four patent
applications filed with both Taiwan and US patent offices. We apologize that because the
patents are under review, the results on micro and nano molding are not reported this time.

6. 計畫成果自評
本計畫主要的兩項工作分別是，（1）建基於高等控制理論之智慧型成型控制的研
發，以及（2）創新微/奈米成型製程之研發。以下謹從這兩方面評估本計畫之成效。
 射出成型智慧型控制之研究
本研究本質屬於 trend setting領域開創性，針對射出成型控制提出完全嶄新的虛擬
感測構想，同時開發相對的以虛擬感測為主之智慧型學習控制理論與應用。在成型製程
的虛擬感測研究，藉由成型程序（molding process）降階的動態模式（reduced order
dynamic model），引入非線性觀測器理論（nonlinear observer theory），探討成型程序的
可觀測性，設計有效的觀測器，達到對成型程序虛擬感測的目的。經由有系統的分析一
系列實機射出實驗，證實了此構想的可行性。更於日前完成充填階段之虛擬感測器設計
與實機驗證，現正整理資料撰寫論文與申請專利中。
在智慧型成型控制方面，已經在美國塑膠工程師年會 ANTEC 2003發表了第一篇直
接針對非線性射出成型動態進行分析的疊代學習成型控制，同時據此結果獲得中華民國
發明專利。現正著手進行以虛擬感測為主之智慧型學習控制理論之推導。
總計在這領域已發表之研究成果，加上現正撰寫中的一篇論文與一項專利，將會包
括 2篇 SCI論文、2篇收錄於 EI之國際研討會論文、2項專利、1篇雜誌文章、與 3篇
國內研討會論文。
 創新微/奈米成型製程之研發
「微/奈米成型製程之研發」則是過去三年來試著結合「成型技術」研究與「微/奈
米科技」所建立的新研究領域。經過三年的努力，近一年多來已經得到相當豐盛的研究
成果，在創新微/奈米成型製程上提出四項專利申請，經過學校研發處審核通過後，同時
台灣與美國專利。同時由於這項研發，也衍生出多項相關研發成果，包括 3篇 SCI論文
[12][13][14]與 1項同時向國內與美國提出申請之專利。以上所述之研發專利皆屬於平面
顯示器製程領域，若能夠成功地導入實際量產應用，將對台灣兩兆雙星產業之一的平面
顯示器產業產生非常大的直接貢獻。
綜觀本計畫截至目前的成果，在論文與專利發表的數量上屬於”中規中矩”，但最令
我們興奮的是，不論是在射出成型領域所提出之虛擬感測控制方法，或是在微/奈米製造
領域所提出之創新微/奈米成型製程，皆屬於開創性 trend setting的研發成果，若經過進
一步的研發與實例驗證成功後，在其所屬領域將成為世界一流的研發成果。
