This search aims to investigate into children’s attitudes towards android robot appearance and 
behavior as well as study how children interact with robots. A two-year study was conducted to 
allow researchers to get insight of the research issue. The study investigated children’s attitudes 
toward robots with different degrees of anthropomorphic appearance and behavior. The effects of 
gender will be examined as well. Through this study, we hope to gain an insight into how children 
identify the degrees of anthropomorphic appearances of robots, the influence of children’s gender 
on their attitudes toward robot. Then, the design principles of android robot appearances and 
behaviors for children were proposed. Based on the design principles, the study developed three 
robot prototypes and created scenario-based video prototyping. With the video prototyping, the 
study further to evaluate children’s experiences of prototype systems to get deep insight of the 
appearance design and interaction design of robots for children. Through this two-year study, we 
attain the following goals: 1, to provide robot-related industries with a set of principles for the robot 
design for children; 2, to develop a research method to study the field of human-robot interaction; 3, 
to understand how to implement methods for the research involving children. People conducted the 
study will acquire a Human-Robot Interaction study experience and the training of research 
methods applied in this study.

朝向人與機器人互動研究之關注 
機器人從工業目的轉換至個人娛樂與服務目的，這些機器人將與人直接互動，個人服務
機器人所提供的互動設計相形地更為重要，人與機器人互動(HRI, Human-Robot Interaction)
引發學界與業界關注此議題的研究與應用。從人機互動的角度觀之，這些服務性機器人很重
要的一個特質在於他們與人共享實體的空間，使用者的對象亦從小孩到老人都有可能的廣大
範圍。如同其他高科技產品，機器人也需要透過介面與人互動，不同與工業機器人，這些具
有智能、服務功能、娛樂性機器人逐漸走入日常生活，人與機器人的互動將更為密切與頻繁，
服務性機器人的介面設計除了滿足安全與使用性外，也必須讓人覺得容易親近、友善的、具
社會特質等感受。 
人與機器人互動(HRI)的設計探索與研究大約從 1990 年開始，例如：美國 Interval 
Research Corporation 開始研究兒童與成人對社會化機器人(sociable robot)的反應(Scheeff, et 
al., 2000)，在歐洲與日本亦著手相關研究(Kanda, et al., 2004)，MIT 多媒體實驗室研究人員
(Breazeal, 2002)試圖創造能與人們更社交互動的機器人。Scassellati(2000)則藉由擬人機器人
來檢是人們對機器人的心智模式的發展。Sparrow(2002)定義機器人是設計來參與和複製社會
與情感的關係，是人造夥伴(Ersatz companions)。Nomura(2004)進行了相關研究來了解人們對
於機器人的焦慮態度，他們指出對機器人態度的差異也和對電腦焦慮的心理建構有關，電腦
焦慮考量於個體在使用電腦或想到電腦時所產生的焦慮和恐懼(Raub 1981)，這將降低使用者
接受與學習電腦的意願。電腦焦慮包含了電腦對社會影響的焦慮、對於新科技的焦慮。而機
器人正好是整合電腦的新科技產物，對機器人所產生的焦慮情緒也可能阻止了人們與機器人
的互動。這種對機器人所產生的負面情緒和態度所產生的影響仍不清楚。然而，機器人的應
用日俱見增，將逐漸融入人們的日常生活與職場工作場域。對機器人態度的了解正如同研究
人們對電腦的態度一樣重要。 
此外，人們對於機器人也有不同的觀感，特別是擬人機器人（android robot）的外觀形
貌也影響人們對它們的感覺。讓機器展現具有人性特質的介面與使用者產生社會化層面的互
動關係一直是人機互動研究的努力目標，學者指出這種具有人性特質的介面能衍生容易使用
與舒適的感受，亦能提升使用者對互動過程的滿意度(Laurel, 1990; Shneiderman, 1998; Sproull 
及機器人如何成為工作團隊中的一員。著名的國際設計競賽--名古屋國際設計競賽(此競賽列
為教育部獎勵學生參加「藝術與設計類」國際競賽的第一等)，在2006年的主題正是機器人
(Robot)，目的在於鼓勵設計學子探討機器人的設計。顯然地，隨著機器人逐漸成為服務與個
人化之消費性產品，機器人產業更需要設計實務與研究的加入，以開發適合與人共處的產品。 
圖1. Fong等人提出機器人發展所涉及的專業領域  
擬人機器人透過他們虛擬的外表和行為，將更吸引人們對待他們不同於其他科技產品
(Fong, et al., 2003)。Kiesler 和 Goetz(2002)的研究顯示機器人具有擬人特徵或行為的與否會影
響人們對機器人的功能認定和偏好。Nass 等人提出電腦即為社會成員(Computers as social 
actors)，提出人們會更樂於和具有人類屬性的電腦互動。就人們會是電腦為社會成員的角度
觀之，具有人的特質介面像是仿照人們的臉部表情、社會互動、聲音等屬性將會引發人們產
生移情作用下的偏好。擬人的介面設計可提升人與機器的社會互動，可讓人們直覺地了解機
器人的動作的溝通意涵。雖然擬人的形貌和行為有助於人們對機器人的感知，根據日本機器
人學家森政弘(Mori,2005)所提出的"詭異谷" Uncanny Valley 假說(如圖 2 所示)。詭異谷假說認
為，人和非人(包括機器人、其他生物)的互動上，如果用與人相像的程度當作 X 軸，人對該
物的喜好度當作 Y 軸，則喜好的程度並不是平順的隨著和人相像的程度而成長。起初，喜
好的程度確實會隨著相像的程度而逐漸上升，但是到了一定程度之後，人對它的喜好感會急
劇下降，甚至會轉成負面的厭惡；直到相像程度再進一步的逼進，才會再拉升回來。如果可
以把這些機器人形貌很精確的排出一個頻譜，位在詭異谷中的機器人是不適於應用在人類社
會中的，在設計機器人的擬人形貌時也應該避開這區間，然而，每個人對於接受度都不一樣，
在設計時應考量不同族群的接受程度。

初期實驗樣本分群過程： 
實驗受測者為 26 位(有效受測者)新竹國小學生，男生 13 人、女生 13 人，年齡為 10~11
歲，進行擬人化程度感覺評估。實驗過程分小組進行，一次進行 5~6 位受測者，分別使用不
同的桌椅，在不受干擾的情況下進行。由三位研究者參與實驗過程，一位實驗者搭配兩位受
測者，過程中受測者對分類原則及圖片不了解時可以向研究者發問，但是受測者之間不可以
交談。首先受測者拿到亂數排列之機器人彩色圖卡，在給分量表上填寫年齡與性別後，沒有
受測時間限制下，開始進行擬人化程度感覺分類。 
3-1-3 前測實驗結果分析 
前測實驗主要目的為，透過受測族群對於擬人化機器人造形的評價，了解樣本的擬人化
程 度 及 影 響 程 度 ， 將 實 驗 結 果 進 行 統 計 分 析 (SPSS) ， 採 用 Clustering analysis- 
Agglomerative-Ward’s Method，可將樣本集群為四大群。由設計專家進一步地進行最終 12 個
實驗二樣本篩選評估，評估原則包含兩個類別，一為數據分析，對於擬人化機器人造形的評
價分數最低(後 5%)及最高(前 5%)之樣本，及各群評價分數為 25%~75%之間的樣本；另一原

實驗二則是以前測實驗所篩選及評估後之「不同擬人程度機器人」動態影片樣本共 10 項，針
對不同性別之兒童受測者，包括小學中、高年級學生及國中學生進行動態影片問卷調查。 
實驗設計：問卷題目採用實驗一問卷調查之設計為基礎，樣本數為 10 項，以動態方式呈現
30 秒後，進入問卷填寫模式；動態樣本可分為兩大類，一為具備說話特徵及動作特徵的樣本
3 項，二為僅具備動作特徵的樣本 7 項。 
實驗步驟：實驗受測者規劃小學中、高年級學生 4 個班級約 150 人，國中學生 2 個班級約 75
人參與，實驗總受測者人數約 225 人。實驗將採受測者獨立使用電腦螢幕觀看動態影片後填
寫問卷，受測時間包含實驗進行說明約 30 分鐘。 
 
3-3-1 參與對象 
本研究隨機抽取苗栗和新竹國小的四年級和六年級學生，以及苗栗和新竹國中八年級的學生
作為本研究的受測對象。在去除資料不完整之問卷，四年級有 108 名(男生有 59 位，女生有
49 位)，六年級有 118 名(男生有 65 位，女生有 53 位)，八年級有 85 名(男生有 42 位，女生有
43 位)學生。因課程學習自三年級就排進電腦課程，因此全部的同學都有使用電腦的經驗。 
 
3-3-2 實驗設計 
本研究採 2 x 3 二因子單變量分析之完全受試者內的實驗設計。獨立變項有二：一為性別，分
有男和女二個水準；二為年級，分為四年級、六年級與八年級三個水準，分別對於十個機器
人在社會吸引、身體吸引，以及智能吸引的影響。當因子有顯著效果時，利用事後檢定其間
的差異，檢驗水準採用 Bonferroni 法進行校正。另外，當性別和年級有顯著交互作用時，須
進一步作第二次檢定，採用獨立 T 檢定兩因子之間之差異。 
 
3-3-3 實驗情境設計 
本研究利用 Flash CS4 動畫軟體搭配程式設計軟體 Visual Basic 6.0 的運算下，撥放機器人的
影片作為實驗工具，此程式可在一般電腦上執行。實驗樣本共有十個機器人影片(如表 3 所
示)，其中三個機器人有說話聲，分別為：MDS、Actroid Female，以及 Cybernetic Human，

3-3-4 測量工具 
採用實驗二所使用之社會吸引量表與身體吸引量表。 
 
3-3-5 實驗施測程序 
本實驗分為兩個階段。第一階段是讓受試者熟悉本研究的媒體，研究者於正式實驗前示範如
何使用測試的軟體，並講解影片撥放，以及問卷題問答的操作過程，讓所有受試者熟悉其互
動形式，以避免實驗過程中因對介面不熟悉而影響實驗結果。 
第二階段為正式實驗的實施，每次均有三十位受試者統一於電腦教室中參與實驗，實驗人員
需確實每位受試者配有耳機，以防止聲音輸出對實驗所造成的干擾，並確保媒體能正常執行。
開始實驗後，實驗人員須陪同受試者填寫正確的基本資料，再請受試者按下播放影片。到問
卷作答階段時，實驗人員須在旁提醒受試者盡量避免都勾選滿意或都不滿意等無鑑別力的答
案。如此反覆操作完成十個機器人的影片觀看，實驗總長度約為 60 分鐘。實驗人員在完成實
驗後，致贈筆記本或遊戲卡一份給予受試者以表感謝之意。 
 
3-3-6 實驗結果 
社會吸引 
不同性別及年級是否影響機器人在社會吸引因子的表現，兒童對機器人的社會吸引的統計顯
示於圖9。 
圖 1a 依性別作區分的平均分數結果如下：男生認為 ifot(M 男=5.44)和 NAO(M 男=5.13)這兩個
機器人具有較高的社會吸引，而 Miss Rong Cheng(M 男=3.8)機器人最沒有社會吸引力；另外，
女生則認為具社會吸引因子的機器人多達五種，分別是 ifot(M 女=6.02)、Actroid Female(M 女
=5.97)、Cybernetic Human(M 女=5.59)、NAO(M 女=5.4)，以及 MDS(M 女=5.02)機器人，而且沒
有一個機器人不合乎社會吸引的能力。 
圖9b顯示各年級之差異陳述如下：四年級和六年級對機器人的評比分數相似，評比均超過4
分以上，其中最具有社會吸引的魅力分別是ifot(M四年級=5.67和M六年級=5.85)、NAO(M四年級=5.47
和M六年級=5.37)，以及Actroid Female三個機器人(M四年級=5.24和M六年級=5.37)。然而，八年級對機
器人在社會吸引的評比結果，明顯不同於其他兩個年級，他們認為Actroid Female(M八年級=5.8)、
ifot(M八年級=5.56)，以及Cybernetic Human (M八年級=5.35)這三個機器人較有社會吸引的能力，而
Miss Rong Cheng機器人沒有(M八年級=3.95)。 
這些機器人都是具有高度的身體吸引。相較於女生，男生對於機器人的外形吸引力偏低。由
此可見，性別不同，判別身體吸引因子的影響程度不同。 
圖 10b 顯示各年級之結果，發現不同年級在評比身體吸引方面有所差異：四年級在此面向的
喜厭程度仍與上述的社會吸引上相同，最喜歡的機器人有 ifot(M 四年級=5.22)、Actroid Female(M
四年級=5.3)、NAO(M 四年級=5.18)；而 Actroid Female 機器人仍受六年級評比為最高(M 六年級=5.3)，
而 MDS 和 Miss Rong Cheng 則在身體吸引的表現最差(MDS: M 六年級=3.8; Miss Rong Cheng: M
六年級=3.9)；然而，八年級的學生在此面向的判斷上，除了 Actroid Female(M 八年級=5.92)機器人

305)=9.4, p< 0.01, F年級(2, 305)=5.1, p< 0.01; NAO: F性別(1, 305)=3.9, p= 0.05, F年級(2, 305)=4.4, p< 0.05; 
Miss Rong Cheng: F性別(1, 305)=17.4, p< 0.001, F年級(2, 305)=5.1, p< 0.01; Actroid Female: F性別(1, 
305)=48.6, p< 0.001, F年級(2, 305)=4.5, p< 0.05)。經事後檢定這五個機器人在性別和年級之差異，分
別陳述如下： 
就性別差異的結果，發現男生認同Jonny 5機器人較能表現出身體吸引的能力(M男=4.5, M女
=4)，而女生則認為是Roborior、NAO、Miss Rong Cheng，以及Actroid Female四個機器人
(Roborior: M男=4.2, M女=4.8; NAO: M男=4.7, M女=5.1; Miss Rong Cheng: M男=3.6, M女=4.4; 
Actroid Female: M男=5, M女=6.1)。另外，各年級之間的差異上，四年級對Jonny 5、NAO，以及
Miss Rong Cheng機器人的分數比八年級高(Jonny 5: M四年級=4.6, M八年級=4; NAO: M四年級=5.2, M八年
級=4.6; Miss Rong Cheng: M四年級=4.5, M八年級=3.7)，但是六年級與另兩個年級均無顯著差異(Jonny 
5: M六年級=4.2; NAO: M六年級=4.9; Miss Rong Cheng: M六年級=3.9)。另外，八年級對Roborior機器人
的評比上比其他兩年級低(M八年級=4.1)，他們認為Actroid Female機器人最有身體吸引的表現(M
八年級=5.9)，而另兩個年級之間對這兩個機器人並無顯著差異(Roborior: M四年級=4.7; M六年級=4.6; 
Actroid Female: M四年級=4.5, M六年級=4.5)。 
另外，兒童對ifot和MDS機器人在性別因子達高顯著的主要效果(ifot: F性別(1, 305)=20.7, p< 0.001; 
MDS: F性別(1, 305)=4, p< 0.05)。由事後檢定這兩個機器人在性別因子之差異，發現女生的評比分
數均高於男生(ifot: M男=4.6, M女=5.4; MDS: M男=3.9, M女=4.3)。

心智模式賦予人性與擬人的表徵(Friedman, Kahn, & Hagman, 2003)，傾向將機器人擬人
化，這或許受到科幻小說或對自主移動感知的影響(School & Tremoulet, 2000)。當機器人
被賦予擬人的形貌時，會鼓勵人們將它們系統的心智模式擬人化(Hinds, Roberts, &Jones, 
2004)，比較人們對擬人外表的機器人和機器形貌的機器人的態度，發現人們比較願意對
具有擬人外表的機器人回應，具有擬人的機器人比機械外在更能提供自然的介面。在機
器人的設計上，擬人化手法可潤滑人與機器人的社會互動，適當地平衡了它的表徵(讓使
用者相信它在負責的功能上是精熟的)與功能(提供足夠的能力來支援人機互動)(DiSalvo, 
et al, 2002)。為達更自然的溝通來設計擬人外表的機器人，也促使人們在與這些擬人般機
器人的互動下，產生了情感的依附。因此，雖然機器人沒有真實的人類情緒，即便是簡
具人類形貌的機器人都能引發人們的情感依附，而改變了機器人從機器的定位到人們社
會中的一成員(Intini, 2005)。因此，本計畫希冀透過一系列相互關聯研究來探討兒童對於
機器人擬人程度的分類標準、不同性別之兒童對於呈現不同擬人程度形貌的機器人的態
度與偏好、不同性別之兒童對於呈現不同擬人程度動作的機器人的態度與偏好、了解兒
童對於機器人呈現不同動作行為與形貌的態度。以兒童作為研究對象，則不可忽略
Piaget(1929)提出「萬物有靈現象」是運思期兒童特有的思考表現，兒童特有的思維影響
他們於機器人擬人化以及動作的配合的感知程度比成人有更強烈的感受，因此本研究首
先關注兒童如何從外貌區分機器人擬人程度。實驗一結果可得知兒童對於對於機器人形
貌大致可分為四個群組，機器形貌機器人、具有擬人與機器形貌之機器人、擬人形貌機
器人、高度擬人形貌之機器人。綜觀群組分類與組內的程度排列顯示的兒童對於機器人
之擬人程度是具有區別能力。 
根據實驗一的結果，選出從低擬人程度到高擬人程度的機器人作為刺激樣品，來了解兒
童對於這些機器人的社會與外形的吸引力。實驗二結果顯示兒童的偏好態度也呈現如森
政弘所提出的"詭異谷" Uncanny Valley 假說所提出的曲線變化。所不同的是，森政弘的理
論指出在詭意谷之後機器人，意即高度擬人形貌的機器人會獲得最高的認同。從其實驗
二的評價曲線偏好分析得知，全體受測者偏好的評價最高樣本為樣本 6 與樣本 12 (如圖
21 所示)，樣本 12 是為真人於電影所飾演機器人角色的形貌，而樣本 6 卻是落於詭異谷
之前的機器人，外形設計是結合擬人與機器的形貌，顯示針對兒童所設計機器人的設計
並不需要追求高度擬人設計，這樣的設計可與真人有所差別，可避免落入詭異谷中而引

2006)。Woods研究指出兒童偏好卡通外貌的機器人，樣本 6卡通般外形也符合Woods(2006)
研究結果。除了具有卡通般可愛的外形設計，DiSalvo 等人(2002)指出機器人的臉影響人
們對其擬人程度的判斷，其中臉的長寬比與五官呈現也影響人們對於機器人的偏好，人
們通常偏好臉型稍微寬的機器人，兩眼距離大於眼睛的直徑。透過外殼設計來隱藏其內
部機械結構與線路可讓機器人同時兼具擬人與產品的意象，有助於提升人們對機器人的
好感。由此觀之，樣本 6 的臉型與五官配置，以及具有擬人與產品的意象等設計手法符
合其研究論點，這也可以解釋樣本 6 在機器人形貌的研究中獲得較高的社會吸引與外型
吸引的原因。 
並呈現高度的社會臨場感，人們對語音感知的敏感度也遠甚於其他聲音，發展出受語音觸發
的特質(voice-activated)，語音不僅僅是說話者將文字傳送給聽者的功用(Clark, 1996,)，它本身
所承載的社交訊息使得人們對說話聲音的感受遠勝於對文字的感受，因而會讓人們直覺地對
其衍生與人連結的心理反應，因此兒童會對於會「說話」的機器人衍生了社會面向的反應與
認同，當人們聽到「說話」的聲音，會衍生與人連結的社會臨場感，而表現出如同與人的互
動反應。研究顯示善用語音特質在電腦的互動設計，其社會特質可引發使用者對電腦產生人
際互動感受，提升對系統的認同與偏好，藉由語音的引導與回饋的互動形式，達成人際互動
之存在感(Nass, & Gong, 2000)。

還可以通過人的肢體語言和面部表情等非語言線索與人類進行交流，並作出回應。除了學術
界的探討，著名的家電公司飛利浦(Philips)於2004開發出iCat(如圖24所示)，希冀整合硬體、

ABSTRACT 
This study aims at enhancing the sociability of instructional media by adding 
auditory and visual social cues to engage children’s attention in e-learning 
environments. The social cues used in the study are speech and facial expressions, 
both of which are essential in interpersonal communication. A quasi experiment 
was conducted to explore how the rendering of these two social cues affects 
children’s attitudes toward computers and their motivation as they participate in e-
learning environments. A total of 40 girls and 46 boys participated in the study. Data 
were collected via a questionnaire that probed into the perceived social presence, 
similar attraction toward computers, and intrinsic motivation. The results 
demonstrate children’s preference for speech in auditory modality over facial

e-learning environments to support simulated social interactions between a learner 
and the computer by employing social cues borrowed from social contexts [8].  
1.2. Social cues: Speech vs. facial expressions 
As concluded above, adding social cues to interface design can allow users to 
perceive computers as social entities and therefore deliver social responses to 
them. According to previous findings, social cues such as speech and human face 
have been widely employed to enrich social attributes of the media. This study aims 
at investigating the effects of two social cues, speech and facial expressions, in e-
learning environments on children’s feelings of social presence, similar attraction 
toward computer, and their motivation in learning. Speech plays a dominant role in 
interpersonal communication. As long as social groups continue to be an integral 
part of human life, human sensitivity to voice and language cues has a critical role to 
play in the interactions among people. On the other hand, the face, being the most 
important channel of emotional expression, does play a significant role in social 
communication. Therefore, symbols of facial expressions have been applied in 
human-computer interfaces as a means of communication.  
Speech and facial expressions are powerful cues in human-human interaction. 
The two are conveyed via the auditory modality and visual modality, which are two 
important components in multimedia. Adding visual components like facial 
expressions or sound effects such as speech to instructional media does not only 
make them more appealing, but can render the media sociable and friendly, thus 
enabling young learners to feel warm and motivated in the learning process. In 
order to achieve such by utilizing the two social cues, the way children process 
visual and auditory information should be studied further because their modality 
preference may influence how they perceive while interacting within e-learning 
environments. Research reveals that young children are more likely to process 
auditory stimuli [9]. Young children have a preference for auditory information and 
the bias changes in the course of development [10]. A differential modality 
preference in children and adults was found; children aged below 4 rely mainly on 
auditory stimuli while adults rely mainly on visual inputs. However, school-age 
children’s modality preference is not well understood and thus remains to be 
explored. Pupils are one of the main user groups of e-learning; hence, 
understanding their preference might be useful for instruction design.  
Posner et al. [11] argued that visual stimuli are less likely to automatically engage 
attention than auditory stimuli, and people have to learn to direct their attention to 
visual information. Compared with texts and symbols in the visual channel, speech 
in the auditory channel is cognitively less demanding [12]. Moreover, speech is a 
dynamic process that can trigger people’s focus on the content and keep the 
audience in awareness during its creation [13], thus exerting a high degree of social 
presence.  
As seen from the above, the sound of speech is effective in gaining users’ 
attention; nevertheless, Zaidel and Mehrabian [14] claimed that facial expressions 
  
learning activity alone. Thus, it is predicted that speech and facial expressions can 
work equally for bettering learning experiences and motivating learners. 
3. METHOD 
3.1. Participants 
Eighty-six sixth graders (40 girls and 46 boys) from three classes of two 
elementary schools in Hsinchu participated in the experiment. The average age was 
11.4 years. All subjects have used computers and have received computer 
instruction at least once a week in the schools since third grade. A total of 83 
percent of the subjects reported that they often used computers at home for game 
playing and web browsing.  
3.2. Experimental design 
The design was within-subjects with one factor with two levels (speech and facial-
expression). The dependent variables were the perceived social presence, 
children’s similar attraction towards computers, and intrinsic motivation. 
3.3. Experimental materials 
The instructional material was prepared as a math problem-solving practice 
program designed in Macromedia Flash. There are two versions of the program 
developed respectively with speech and facial-expression feedbacks during 
interaction. Feedbacks provided include a greeting at the beginning, feedback on 
correct or wrong answer, and giving comments on the subject’s performance at the 
end. Speech for this study was created from recordings made by a young female. 
Facial expressions were depicted in small yellow faces with different emotions that 
matched different situations. 
3.4. Measurements  
Social presence: The first set of questions adopted the four items proposed by 
Short, Williams, and Christie [19] for measuring social presence, namely 
sociable/unsociable, personal/impersonal, sensitive/insensitive, and warm/cold, 
using a semantic differential technique. The semantic differential technique was 
used with bipolar five-point scales. (Cronbach’s α = 0.85) 
Similar attraction: Similar attraction is measured by social and intellectual 
attractions which are two important criteria in the similarity-attraction hypothesis of 
the interpersonal relationship [20]. The questions were adapted from Moon [21] for 
measuring subjects’ perceptions of the computer with respect to similar attraction. 
The scale consists of six items: Do you find the computer friendly, competent, clever, 
and intelligent? Do you like this computer? Do you like doing math exercise with 
this computer? (Cronbach’s α = 0.87) 
Intrinsic motivation: The questions were adapted from the Activity-Feeling Scales 
(AFS) developed by Reeve and Sickenius [22] for measuring subjects’ intrinsic

5. DISCUSSION 
This study investigated the application within e-learning environments 
respectively with speech and facial expressions acting as social cues to engage 
children in learning. As mentioned earlier, speech and facial expressions are 
essential in interpersonal communication. The two were expected to be used as 
social cues in e-learning environments and have similar effects on enhancing 
children’s attitudes toward computers and boosting their motivation. The analysis of 
the data from the current study, however, indicates that the two social cues made a 
significant difference in the participants’ perception and motivation. The 
participants receiving speech feedback tended to perceive computers on the social 
dimension and reported stronger motivation.   
Speech has unique properties which can be associated with humans. It is not only 
true that speech in the auditory channel draws directly people’s attention, but it also 
originates from the evolution of human social interaction. Therefore, when people 
hear speech, the social presence linking them to other people is achieved. Clearly, 
speech can create stronger gains in social presence and elicit more attention from 
others in the process of interaction than text or symbols can. Since the social 
responses delivered by instructional media are easy to manipulate, people’s social 
awareness toward the media is triggered not only by fancy or sophisticated 
interface but also by voice-based interface. Thus, instruction designers could 
promote human-computer interaction to the level of human-human interaction by 
adding speech feedback.  
Compared with speech feedback, facial-expression feedback does not seem 
sufficient for inducing children’s social responses and engaging them in e-learning 
activities. As to whether school-age children show differential preferences for 
auditory social cues and visual social cues while interacting with computers, the 
findings reveal that children prefer speech in auditory format to facial expressions 
in visual format. To elicit unconscious social responses, a computer still has to 
exhibit enough cues to make people feel the computer worthy of social responses 
[23]. In other words, it might mean that facial expressions are not as sufficient as 
speech in functioning as social cues for interface design. Nevertheless, human brain 
processes facial images differently from images of all other objects, just as the way 
it processes voices differently from all other sounds [24, 25]. In social contexts, 
humans depend highly on facial expressions during communication, which also

meaningful social interaction between human and robot. Such notions lead to an 
assumption that increasing the realism of a robot has practical benefits. While many 
researchers are exerting efforts to pursue a highly humanlike form for a social robot, 
we are interested in the degree of realism involved that people deem sociable and 
appealing. This study specifically addressed the attitudes of children toward robots 
displaying various degrees of anthropomorphic appearance, as numerous robots have 
been created to serve as social companions or learning partners for children. 
Various robots are specifically designed for children, for educational, entertainment, 
and therapeutic purposes. Therefore, understanding children’s perceptions of humanoid 
robots with various degrees of realism is essential. Studies related to Computers As 
Social Actors (CASA) have empirically proven that people tend to treat a computer as 
a social entity when the computer exhibits social cues adequately to elicit social 
responses from people [7,8]. This tendency should also apply to the way humans 
interact with humanoid robots, especially robots that exhibit humanlike appearances. 
Regarding research that concerns children’s attitudes toward robots, the phenomenon 
of childhood animism should also be considered. Piaget [9] first used animism to 
describe children’s tendency to endow inanimate things with life and consciousness. 
He outlined four stages of animism through which children normally go. At the first 
stage (age 4–6), a child attributes consciousness and life to anything that is in any way 
active, undamaged, or useful. A whole dish is alive; a broken dish is not alive. In the 
second stage (6－7), only objects that move are given life-like qualities. In the third 
stage (8－10), consciousness is attributed only to objects that move spontaneously. In 
the final stage (older than age of 11), a child restricts consciousness and life to plants 
and animals only. According to Piaget, animism probably demonstrates children’s 
incomplete knowledge and understanding of the world, and changes in the course of 
development. Okita et al. [10] also revealed that elder children attribute less animistic 
properties to robots compared to younger ones, but the reductions occur in piecemeal 
fashion. 
As mentioned above, the fact that children over-generalize animacy might lead 
them to accept a robot and treat it as a social partner, regardless of the degree to 
which it appears like humans. Children use their animistic intuition to attribute 
intelligence, biological function, and intention to the objects they encounter [11,12]. 
This raises the question as to whether robots that interact with children should have a 
humanoid appearance (an appearance that closely resembles human beings). 
Understanding the means by which children perceive and evaluate robots across the 
spectrum of anthropomorphism is a critical issue within the field of robotics research. 
The phenomenon of childhood animism diminishes gradually as children get older, 
leading to the prediction that age differences might affect children’s perceptions of 
humanoid robots. In addition to age-related factors, gender differences served as a 
noteworthy factor in this study as gender differences related to child interaction with 
agents offered by computers were discovered [13]. Thus, this study further 
investigated whether age and age differences affect children attitudes toward robots 
with different degrees of apparent realism. 
To summarize, this study aimed at exploring children’s attitudes toward humanoid 
robots with different anthropomorphic appearances. This research was interested in 
how children differentiate the degrees of realism of robots and examined whether or 
not these degrees of realism make a difference in their perceptions of humanoid

2.2   Experiment2 
Experiment 2 was conducted to understand whether or not children’s attitudes toward 
robots differ with the degrees of realism and to examine the effects of gender and age 
differences on children’s feelings toward the robots. 
Participants. A large sample group of 267 children (N=267) was recruited, including 
87 fourth graders (42 girls and 45 boys), 86 sixth graders (42 girls and 44 boys), and 
94 eighth graders (45 girls and 49 boys) from five schools. 
Measurement Tools. The dependent variables of social attraction and physical 
attraction were modified from a version of McCroskey and McCain's [15] social and 
physical attraction scale, as well as from relevant studies that adapted the same scale 
to measure users’ attitudes toward computers, robots, or media [16,17]. Social 
attraction and physical attraction are two key dimensions of interpersonal attraction, 
have been found to be facilitators of interpersonal communication leading to the 
formation of friendships. Several humanoid robots are being developed to enhance 
attitudes of social acceptance among users in an attempt to build social relationships. 
For this reason, this study investigated whether or not different levels of 
anthropomorphic appearances influence children’s social and physical attraction 
toward robots. 
The social attraction scale consists of five items: 1) “I think this robot is friendly”; 
2) “I like this robot”; 3) “I think this robot could be a friend of mine”; 4) “I would like 
to have a friendly chat with this robot”; and 5) “This robot would be pleasant to be 
with”. The physical attraction scale consists of three items: 1) “I think this robot is 
good looking; 2) “I find this robot very attractive physically”; and 3) “I like the way 
this robot looks”. The two sets were measured using a set of paper-and-pencil 
questionnaires, each item had a 7-point Likert scale that ranged from 1 (“very 
strongly disagree”) to 7 (“very strongly agree”). The wording used in the 
questionnaires was discussed with teachers and the children to prevent any 
misunderstanding.

Physical Attraction. Table 2 shows the mean physical-attraction scores rated by 
participants in terms of their grades and genders. Figures 3–4 illustrate the physical 
attraction children felt toward the twelve stimuli. Similar preferences for the twelve 
robots were observed regarding physical attractiveness. An ANOVA was performed 
to examine whether age or gender influenced children’s attraction to the appearance 
of the robots in the twelve images. Significant gender differences were observed 
among the ratings for R1, R5, R9, R10, R11, and R12 (all ps＜.05). A similar pattern 
was observed in which boys liked the appearance of R1 far more than girls did, and 
girls liked the appearances of the other images more than the boys did. 
Results show no significant age differences in children’s physical attraction toward 
the twelve robots.

exaggerated features and an encasement to hide mechanical parts to ensure that the 
robot appears not only humanlike but also product-like. Among the twelve robot 
images, the proportion of R6 most closely conformed to the aforementioned design 
guidelines, which could account for why R6 received the highest evaluation regarding 
social and physical attractiveness. 
To examine the individual differences such as age and gender, the results show that 
the influence of children’s age on their attitudes toward robots is less significant than 
that of gender. The results indicate that children, including 4th, 6th, and 8th graders, 
have similar attitudes to and perceptions of humanoid robots. Those children aged 
from 8 to 14 years are in the third and fourth stages according to Piaget’s theory of 
cognitive development. No age-related factors observed in this study imply how 
children’s perception of digital objects or computational companions might be 
evolving because they were born in a digital era. This is a question remaining to be 
answered. 
In contrast to no age-related factors found, an interesting observation involved the 
persistent differences between boys and girls with respect to the ratings of their social 
and physical attraction to robots. The differences were found in their attitudes towards 
robots with the lowest degree of human-likeness and a high degree. Boys reported 
higher social and physical attractiveness of the R1 robot, which is evaluated as the 
lowest degree of human likeness among the stimuli. A possible explanation could be 
that boys are usually more familiar with mechanical tools than girls are and boys were 
more likely to consider a robot with a mechanical appearance attractive. However, the 
preference changed while analyzing attitudes toward robots with high 
anthropomorphic appearances. Results show that girls felt more social and physical 
attraction to those high human-like robots than did boys. A study by Green et al. [24] 
indicated that women have greater tolerance in the acceptable range of facial 
proportion of people and robots. They concluded that traditional feminine nurturing 
roles because increased acceptance and males are generally more familiar with 
mechanical objects with a diminished need to anthropomorphize them. Greater female 
sensitivity to nonverbal cues such as facial expressions may be the result of 
socialization, gender patterns in emotional learning, or gender differences in the brain 
[25,26]. Interestingly, gender differences in the perception of facial expressions in the 
real world also influence the way children interact with humanoid robots. Another 
possible explanation for the tendency among girl participants to favor those humanoid 
robots with high degrees of anthropomorphism is that those robots are presented as 
being female. The findings echo some studies that females favor their own gender 
while males have no gender preference [27,28,29]. 
To summarize, this study observed the way children differentiate the degrees of 
realism of humanoid robots and obtained their attitudes toward robots with different 
anthropomorphic appearances. Findings regarding age and gender differences in their 
perceptions of humanoid robots were discussed. The results of this study could 
provide valuable references for designers and manufacturers of robots.

ABSTRACT 
This study aims at enhancing the sociability of instructional media by adding 
auditory and visual social cues to engage children’s attention in e-learning 
environments. The social cues used in the study are speech and facial expressions, 
both of which are essential in interpersonal communication. A quasi experiment 
was conducted to explore how the rendering of these two social cues affects 
children’s attitudes toward computers and their motivation as they participate in e-
learning environments. A total of 40 girls and 46 boys participated in the study. Data 
were collected via a questionnaire that probed into the perceived social presence, 
similar attraction toward computers, and intrinsic motivation. The results 
demonstrate children’s preference for speech in auditory modality over facial

e-learning environments to support simulated social interactions between a learner 
and the computer by employing social cues borrowed from social contexts [8].  
1.2. Social cues: Speech vs. facial expressions 
As concluded above, adding social cues to interface design can allow users to 
perceive computers as social entities and therefore deliver social responses to 
them. According to previous findings, social cues such as speech and human face 
have been widely employed to enrich social attributes of the media. This study aims 
at investigating the effects of two social cues, speech and facial expressions, in e-
learning environments on children’s feelings of social presence, similar attraction 
toward computer, and their motivation in learning. Speech plays a dominant role in 
interpersonal communication. As long as social groups continue to be an integral 
part of human life, human sensitivity to voice and language cues has a critical role to 
play in the interactions among people. On the other hand, the face, being the most 
important channel of emotional expression, does play a significant role in social 
communication. Therefore, symbols of facial expressions have been applied in 
human-computer interfaces as a means of communication.  
Speech and facial expressions are powerful cues in human-human interaction. 
The two are conveyed via the auditory modality and visual modality, which are two 
important components in multimedia. Adding visual components like facial 
expressions or sound effects such as speech to instructional media does not only 
make them more appealing, but can render the media sociable and friendly, thus 
enabling young learners to feel warm and motivated in the learning process. In 
order to achieve such by utilizing the two social cues, the way children process 
visual and auditory information should be studied further because their modality 
preference may influence how they perceive while interacting within e-learning 
environments. Research reveals that young children are more likely to process 
auditory stimuli [9]. Young children have a preference for auditory information and 
the bias changes in the course of development [10]. A differential modality 
preference in children and adults was found; children aged below 4 rely mainly on 
auditory stimuli while adults rely mainly on visual inputs. However, school-age 
children’s modality preference is not well understood and thus remains to be 
explored. Pupils are one of the main user groups of e-learning; hence, 
understanding their preference might be useful for instruction design.  
Posner et al. [11] argued that visual stimuli are less likely to automatically engage 
attention than auditory stimuli, and people have to learn to direct their attention to 
visual information. Compared with texts and symbols in the visual channel, speech 
in the auditory channel is cognitively less demanding [12]. Moreover, speech is a 
dynamic process that can trigger people’s focus on the content and keep the 
audience in awareness during its creation [13], thus exerting a high degree of social 
presence.  
As seen from the above, the sound of speech is effective in gaining users’ 
attention; nevertheless, Zaidel and Mehrabian [14] claimed that facial expressions 
  
learning activity alone. Thus, it is predicted that speech and facial expressions can 
work equally for bettering learning experiences and motivating learners. 
3. METHOD 
3.1. Participants 
Eighty-six sixth graders (40 girls and 46 boys) from three classes of two 
elementary schools in Hsinchu participated in the experiment. The average age was 
11.4 years. All subjects have used computers and have received computer 
instruction at least once a week in the schools since third grade. A total of 83 
percent of the subjects reported that they often used computers at home for game 
playing and web browsing.  
3.2. Experimental design 
The design was within-subjects with one factor with two levels (speech and facial-
expression). The dependent variables were the perceived social presence, 
children’s similar attraction towards computers, and intrinsic motivation. 
3.3. Experimental materials 
The instructional material was prepared as a math problem-solving practice 
program designed in Macromedia Flash. There are two versions of the program 
developed respectively with speech and facial-expression feedbacks during 
interaction. Feedbacks provided include a greeting at the beginning, feedback on 
correct or wrong answer, and giving comments on the subject’s performance at the 
end. Speech for this study was created from recordings made by a young female. 
Facial expressions were depicted in small yellow faces with different emotions that 
matched different situations. 
3.4. Measurements  
Social presence: The first set of questions adopted the four items proposed by 
Short, Williams, and Christie [19] for measuring social presence, namely 
sociable/unsociable, personal/impersonal, sensitive/insensitive, and warm/cold, 
using a semantic differential technique. The semantic differential technique was 
used with bipolar five-point scales. (Cronbach’s α = 0.85) 
Similar attraction: Similar attraction is measured by social and intellectual 
attractions which are two important criteria in the similarity-attraction hypothesis of 
the interpersonal relationship [20]. The questions were adapted from Moon [21] for 
measuring subjects’ perceptions of the computer with respect to similar attraction. 
The scale consists of six items: Do you find the computer friendly, competent, clever, 
and intelligent? Do you like this computer? Do you like doing math exercise with 
this computer? (Cronbach’s α = 0.87) 
Intrinsic motivation: The questions were adapted from the Activity-Feeling Scales 
(AFS) developed by Reeve and Sickenius [22] for measuring subjects’ intrinsic

5. DISCUSSION 
This study investigated the application within e-learning environments 
respectively with speech and facial expressions acting as social cues to engage 
children in learning. As mentioned earlier, speech and facial expressions are 
essential in interpersonal communication. The two were expected to be used as 
social cues in e-learning environments and have similar effects on enhancing 
children’s attitudes toward computers and boosting their motivation. The analysis of 
the data from the current study, however, indicates that the two social cues made a 
significant difference in the participants’ perception and motivation. The 
participants receiving speech feedback tended to perceive computers on the social 
dimension and reported stronger motivation.   
Speech has unique properties which can be associated with humans. It is not only 
true that speech in the auditory channel draws directly people’s attention, but it also 
originates from the evolution of human social interaction. Therefore, when people 
hear speech, the social presence linking them to other people is achieved. Clearly, 
speech can create stronger gains in social presence and elicit more attention from 
others in the process of interaction than text or symbols can. Since the social 
responses delivered by instructional media are easy to manipulate, people’s social 
awareness toward the media is triggered not only by fancy or sophisticated 
interface but also by voice-based interface. Thus, instruction designers could 
promote human-computer interaction to the level of human-human interaction by 
adding speech feedback.  
Compared with speech feedback, facial-expression feedback does not seem 
sufficient for inducing children’s social responses and engaging them in e-learning 
activities. As to whether school-age children show differential preferences for 
auditory social cues and visual social cues while interacting with computers, the 
findings reveal that children prefer speech in auditory format to facial expressions 
in visual format. To elicit unconscious social responses, a computer still has to 
exhibit enough cues to make people feel the computer worthy of social responses 
[23]. In other words, it might mean that facial expressions are not as sufficient as 
speech in functioning as social cues for interface design. Nevertheless, human brain 
processes facial images differently from images of all other objects, just as the way 
it processes voices differently from all other sounds [24, 25]. In social contexts, 
humans depend highly on facial expressions during communication, which also

meaningful social interaction between human and robot. Such notions lead to an 
assumption that increasing the realism of a robot has practical benefits. While many 
researchers are exerting efforts to pursue a highly humanlike form for a social robot, 
we are interested in the degree of realism involved that people deem sociable and 
appealing. This study specifically addressed the attitudes of children toward robots 
displaying various degrees of anthropomorphic appearance, as numerous robots have 
been created to serve as social companions or learning partners for children. 
Various robots are specifically designed for children, for educational, entertainment, 
and therapeutic purposes. Therefore, understanding children’s perceptions of humanoid 
robots with various degrees of realism is essential. Studies related to Computers As 
Social Actors (CASA) have empirically proven that people tend to treat a computer as 
a social entity when the computer exhibits social cues adequately to elicit social 
responses from people [7,8]. This tendency should also apply to the way humans 
interact with humanoid robots, especially robots that exhibit humanlike appearances. 
Regarding research that concerns children’s attitudes toward robots, the phenomenon 
of childhood animism should also be considered. Piaget [9] first used animism to 
describe children’s tendency to endow inanimate things with life and consciousness. 
He outlined four stages of animism through which children normally go. At the first 
stage (age 4–6), a child attributes consciousness and life to anything that is in any way 
active, undamaged, or useful. A whole dish is alive; a broken dish is not alive. In the 
second stage (6－7), only objects that move are given life-like qualities. In the third 
stage (8－10), consciousness is attributed only to objects that move spontaneously. In 
the final stage (older than age of 11), a child restricts consciousness and life to plants 
and animals only. According to Piaget, animism probably demonstrates children’s 
incomplete knowledge and understanding of the world, and changes in the course of 
development. Okita et al. [10] also revealed that elder children attribute less animistic 
properties to robots compared to younger ones, but the reductions occur in piecemeal 
fashion. 
As mentioned above, the fact that children over-generalize animacy might lead 
them to accept a robot and treat it as a social partner, regardless of the degree to 
which it appears like humans. Children use their animistic intuition to attribute 
intelligence, biological function, and intention to the objects they encounter [11,12]. 
This raises the question as to whether robots that interact with children should have a 
humanoid appearance (an appearance that closely resembles human beings). 
Understanding the means by which children perceive and evaluate robots across the 
spectrum of anthropomorphism is a critical issue within the field of robotics research. 
The phenomenon of childhood animism diminishes gradually as children get older, 
leading to the prediction that age differences might affect children’s perceptions of 
humanoid robots. In addition to age-related factors, gender differences served as a 
noteworthy factor in this study as gender differences related to child interaction with 
agents offered by computers were discovered [13]. Thus, this study further 
investigated whether age and age differences affect children attitudes toward robots 
with different degrees of apparent realism. 
To summarize, this study aimed at exploring children’s attitudes toward humanoid 
robots with different anthropomorphic appearances. This research was interested in 
how children differentiate the degrees of realism of robots and examined whether or 
not these degrees of realism make a difference in their perceptions of humanoid

2.2   Experiment2 
Experiment 2 was conducted to understand whether or not children’s attitudes toward 
robots differ with the degrees of realism and to examine the effects of gender and age 
differences on children’s feelings toward the robots. 
Participants. A large sample group of 267 children (N=267) was recruited, including 
87 fourth graders (42 girls and 45 boys), 86 sixth graders (42 girls and 44 boys), and 
94 eighth graders (45 girls and 49 boys) from five schools. 
Measurement Tools. The dependent variables of social attraction and physical 
attraction were modified from a version of McCroskey and McCain's [15] social and 
physical attraction scale, as well as from relevant studies that adapted the same scale 
to measure users’ attitudes toward computers, robots, or media [16,17]. Social 
attraction and physical attraction are two key dimensions of interpersonal attraction, 
have been found to be facilitators of interpersonal communication leading to the 
formation of friendships. Several humanoid robots are being developed to enhance 
attitudes of social acceptance among users in an attempt to build social relationships. 
For this reason, this study investigated whether or not different levels of 
anthropomorphic appearances influence children’s social and physical attraction 
toward robots. 
The social attraction scale consists of five items: 1) “I think this robot is friendly”; 
2) “I like this robot”; 3) “I think this robot could be a friend of mine”; 4) “I would like 
to have a friendly chat with this robot”; and 5) “This robot would be pleasant to be 
with”. The physical attraction scale consists of three items: 1) “I think this robot is 
good looking; 2) “I find this robot very attractive physically”; and 3) “I like the way 
this robot looks”. The two sets were measured using a set of paper-and-pencil 
questionnaires, each item had a 7-point Likert scale that ranged from 1 (“very 
strongly disagree”) to 7 (“very strongly agree”). The wording used in the 
questionnaires was discussed with teachers and the children to prevent any 
misunderstanding.

Physical Attraction. Table 2 shows the mean physical-attraction scores rated by 
participants in terms of their grades and genders. Figures 3–4 illustrate the physical 
attraction children felt toward the twelve stimuli. Similar preferences for the twelve 
robots were observed regarding physical attractiveness. An ANOVA was performed 
to examine whether age or gender influenced children’s attraction to the appearance 
of the robots in the twelve images. Significant gender differences were observed 
among the ratings for R1, R5, R9, R10, R11, and R12 (all ps＜.05). A similar pattern 
was observed in which boys liked the appearance of R1 far more than girls did, and 
girls liked the appearances of the other images more than the boys did. 
Results show no significant age differences in children’s physical attraction toward 
the twelve robots.

exaggerated features and an encasement to hide mechanical parts to ensure that the 
robot appears not only humanlike but also product-like. Among the twelve robot 
images, the proportion of R6 most closely conformed to the aforementioned design 
guidelines, which could account for why R6 received the highest evaluation regarding 
social and physical attractiveness. 
To examine the individual differences such as age and gender, the results show that 
the influence of children’s age on their attitudes toward robots is less significant than 
that of gender. The results indicate that children, including 4th, 6th, and 8th graders, 
have similar attitudes to and perceptions of humanoid robots. Those children aged 
from 8 to 14 years are in the third and fourth stages according to Piaget’s theory of 
cognitive development. No age-related factors observed in this study imply how 
children’s perception of digital objects or computational companions might be 
evolving because they were born in a digital era. This is a question remaining to be 
answered. 
In contrast to no age-related factors found, an interesting observation involved the 
persistent differences between boys and girls with respect to the ratings of their social 
and physical attraction to robots. The differences were found in their attitudes towards 
robots with the lowest degree of human-likeness and a high degree. Boys reported 
higher social and physical attractiveness of the R1 robot, which is evaluated as the 
lowest degree of human likeness among the stimuli. A possible explanation could be 
that boys are usually more familiar with mechanical tools than girls are and boys were 
more likely to consider a robot with a mechanical appearance attractive. However, the 
preference changed while analyzing attitudes toward robots with high 
anthropomorphic appearances. Results show that girls felt more social and physical 
attraction to those high human-like robots than did boys. A study by Green et al. [24] 
indicated that women have greater tolerance in the acceptable range of facial 
proportion of people and robots. They concluded that traditional feminine nurturing 
roles because increased acceptance and males are generally more familiar with 
mechanical objects with a diminished need to anthropomorphize them. Greater female 
sensitivity to nonverbal cues such as facial expressions may be the result of 
socialization, gender patterns in emotional learning, or gender differences in the brain 
[25,26]. Interestingly, gender differences in the perception of facial expressions in the 
real world also influence the way children interact with humanoid robots. Another 
possible explanation for the tendency among girl participants to favor those humanoid 
robots with high degrees of anthropomorphism is that those robots are presented as 
being female. The findings echo some studies that females favor their own gender 
while males have no gender preference [27,28,29]. 
To summarize, this study observed the way children differentiate the degrees of 
realism of humanoid robots and obtained their attitudes toward robots with different 
anthropomorphic appearances. Findings regarding age and gender differences in their 
perceptions of humanoid robots were discussed. The results of this study could 
provide valuable references for designers and manufacturers of robots.
