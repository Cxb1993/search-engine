2. INTRODUCTION 
In this work, the TLD-100 readout system for various radiotherapy beam doses was 
optimized using the Taguchi methodology. Many researchers consider the use of 
thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) to be the most cost-effective approach for 
performing external dosimetry audits (Arib 2006, Svensson 1993, Derreumaux 1995). 
A well-calibrated TLD readout system not only determines specific doses with good 
reproducibility but also can be used with a wide range of doses. This unique criterion 
for the application of TLD is critical to confirm radiotherapy beam doses, since the 
dose that is given in a single treatment is typically 30-300 cGy. Researchers have also 
noted the tendency to adopt the TLD, and several published papers have offered 
recommendations for optimizing the TLD readout parameters. Dr. Arib optimized the 
characteristics of TLD by specifically adjusting the amount of LiF powder in each 
capsule, the elapsed time between the irradiation and the reading of TLD, and the 
nitrogen flow during measurement (Arib 2006). Dr. Samei optimized the allocation of 
a glow curve for TLD in the heating process (Samei 1994). Dr. Branch employed 
Monte Carlo simulation to predict the glow curve of optimally performing TLD 
(Branch 1999). However, some recommendations made in these studies are very 
controversial since these studies focused mostly on a single parameter despite the 
existence of cross interactions among parameters of the TLD readout system. 
Therefore, this work presents an optimized process for evaluating the TLD absorbed 
dose in various radiotherapy beams based on the Taguchi methodology.

the samples could be organized into only nine groups and still yield results with the 
same confidence as if they were to be considered separately (Taguchi 1990). Table 1 
shows the arrangement of the samples into nine groups according to Taguchi. The 
numbers indicate the various experimental layouts or levels of the different factors. 
 
3.2 Analysis of Variance; ANOVA 
A loss function  is defined to identify any deviation between experimental values 
and desired values. Dr. Taguchi recommends using a loss function to measure 
deviations of the performance characteristics from desired values to suppress 
effectively interference by noise. The loss function value is further transformed into a 
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Performance characteristics fall into three classes; they are 
lower the better, higher the better and nominal is best. Each has its own S/N ratio 
definition to be used in the computation of the optimal combination of parameter. A 
larger S/N ratio always corresponds to optimal quality characteristic, regardless of 
category. Restated, the optimal level of operative parameters is that with the highest 
S/N ratio, and vice versa (Taguchi 1990). Thus, the TLD absorbed dose under various 
radiotherapy beam doses from each group are calculated and reorganized as follows

where  is the inspection index, defined as the signal to noise ratio (S/N unit:dB). S is 
the gross deviation between practical released counts (yi) and theoretical prediction 
for the given dose xi of radiotherapy beam. The  is exactly gradient of the given dose 
as a function of TLD reading. An ideal TLD dosimeter readout system should reflect 
the given dose with good reproducibility (smaller S), and sharp gradient (larger ) in 
real. Thus, A larger value of  is considered preferable herein (this is existed only 
under either smaller numerator, S, or larger denominator, ). In addition, a higher  
(S/N) value also indicates a superior performance for TLD readout system, since the 
major signal dominated the noise. yi is the counts of TLD reading in each group, i, and

tunnel inside the same solid water phantom to obtain the absolute dosimetry as given 
to TLD. The irradiated TLD readout was obtained using a Mikro Lab RA94 TLD 
reader/analyzer and by annealing in furnaces (Barnstead Int. Co. model 47900) 
coupled with an oven/Incubator (model 19200) for 400 1 hour and 100 2 hours. 
Furthermore, the TLD was cooled for at least seven days for next exposure to 
suppress the residual dose effectively.  
 
4.1 Self-developed mathematic (SDM) phantoms  
We have developed three SDM phantoms with anthropometric-shaped skeletons 
constructed of acrylic and epoxy-resin to simulate averaged male body weight 30, 50 
and 70 kg. Acrylic and epoxy-resin were chosen as the neutron and photon transport 
properties. The SDM phantom was GSF adult male mathematical models that heights 
and masses of the whole bodies, as well as the masses of internal organs are based on 
the ICRP reference man and calculated from external neutron and photo irradiated in 
radiotherapy exposures, using Monte Carlo methods, data published by ICRU report 
48 was formulated as follows: skeleton-cortical bone with a physical density 1.486, 
skin, 1.105 and lung-tissue substitute 0.296 g/cm3, respectively (ICRU 48, 1992). The 
SDM phantoms were based on the general human design (ICRU 48, 1992); each was 
constructed of 31 slices, representing the head, neck, torso, abdomen, but without two 
arms and legs. Table 7 lists dimension, physical properties and body mass index (BMI) 
of phantoms.  
 
 
5. RESULTS AND CONFIRMATION OF TLD READOUT 
Table 3 presents the original three TLD readings under various radiotherapy beam 
doses (50cGy, 100cGy and 150cGy) for the nine groups of randomly assigned TLDs. 
Accordingly, twenty seven TLD chips were analyzed. Table 4 plots the analytical 
results for the TLD readout under various radiotherapy beam doses (50cGy, 100cGy 
and 150cGy). The  was an exact gradient of the given dose as a function of TLD 
reading. S refers to the gross deviation between practical counts and regressive 
prediction [cf. Eq. 2]. As Tab. 4 clearly shows, group 8 had the highest  of all nine 
groups and therefore had the steepest gradient for the given doses versus TLD 
readings for various radiotherapy beam doses. Group 1 revealed the lowest statistical 
deviation and thus had the highest reproducibility of all groups. Group 1 also had the 
highest  value which fact indicates that this group achieved the best compromise 
between  and S. Restated, the high regressive slope  and low statistical deviation S 
were both optimal when the TLD readout parameter was the same as that in group 1. 
To further confirm the optimal recommendations of the TLD readout system, 
 8 
of TLD-100 chip in other works (Ozturk 2003, Yossian 1995, Kim 2004, Sabini 2002, 
Wei 2003), the low initial temperature and heating rate in the readout of the TLD chip 
(as evaluated herein) are not always as in the protocol used in other applications. The 
radioactive source that activates the TLD chip remains an important issue since the 
given energy excites electrons from ground state to various meta-excited states. The 
high-energy photons generated by the 6MV linear accelerator can deposit their energy 
into a deep layer of the TLD molecular structure using primarily small-angle 
Compton scattering (Turner 1995). Therefore, a low initial temperature and a slow 
TLD chip heating rate can be used in the readout process in order to help the TLD 
molecular structure release most of the trapped electrons in the layers. Figure. 4 plots 
three typical glow curves of the TLD chip during the readout process. The figure 
clearly shows the same TLD-100 chip placed 5cm deep in the center of a 15cm-thick 
solid water phantom with 100cm SDD then exposed under three different sources 
(a)6MV LINAC 49.37cGy, (b)6MV LINAC 4.94cGy and (c)diagnostic X-ray 
(120kVp, 70mAs) 6.261mGy for comparison. Additionally, diagnostic X-ray is also 
adopted as a radioactive source for further comparison of TLD in wide range. The 
corresponding glow curves reveal diverse characteristics in real TLD counting cases. 
Accordingly, the optimal TLD readout approach is still uncertain in many applications 
(Ozturk 2003, Yossian 1995, Sabini 2002). 
 
6.2 Cross-Interaction between Parameters of TLD Readout 
The Taguchi method not only determines the Quality Control (QC) dominant 
parameters. It is also an effective algorithm for elucidating specific cross-interactions 
among parameters. The unique orthogonal arrangement of different parameter levels 
maintains the same frequency of different levels among nine groups. Therefore, the 
obtained data can also be rearranged to elucidate the cross-interaction between the 
parameters [cf. Tab.1] (Pan 2004, Pan 2005). Figure 5 presents three cross 
interactions between pairs of parameters. Parts (A), (B) and (C) plot initial temp. vs. 
heating rate, initial temp. vs. max. temp., and heating rate vs. max. temp., respectively 
for the TLD readout. In part (A), three lines barely intersect, indicating the absence of 
cross interaction between these two parameters. This situation is preferred for the real 
evaluation of the TLD readout system since the two dominant parameters are weakly 
correlated. The S/N value declines with the initial temperature setting for all three 
heating rates in the TLD readout process. Additionally, the S/N value reaches 
maximum when both initial temperature and heating rate are at minimum (50 and 
3). The initial temperature and maximum temperature in the TLD readout process 
interact moderately with each other [cf. Fig. 5 part.B]. The S/N value declines as the 
initial temperature falls for all three maximum temperature settings. Additionally, the 
 10
various radiotherapy beam doses despite the linearity of the regressed correlation. The 
lowest S value happens to equal that in group 1, which is consistent with the findings 
of the dynamic evaluation. This coincidence does not imply the most dynamic robust 
design since the definition of  and the correlated calculation differ entirely. 
Eventually, the definition of the loss function, S/N () is manipulated to reflect the 
optimal results from various perspectives and thus change the calculations for 
optimization.  
 
 
7 CONCLUSION 
The TLD-100 readout system was optimized for various radiotherapy beam doses 
using the Taguchi methodology. The loss function  was defined as [−10 log (S/)2 ] 
to achieve sharp linearity as well as good reproducibility of the TLD readout at 
various radiotherapy beam doses. The related calculation and discussion were based 
on a dynamic robust design in the optimization process. The suggested optimal 
parameters for TLD readout system herein were (1) 50 for the initial temperature, 
(2) 3/s for the heating rate, (3) 5min. for the TLD preheat time before readout and 
(4) 250 for the maximum temperature setting for the TLD readout. The dominant 
TLD readout parameters were (1) initial temperature setting, (2)heating rate and 
(4)maximum temperature setting, and the minor parameter setting was (3)TLD 
preheat time before the readout. The follow-up evaluations of the cross interactions 
among the parameters revealed no significant conflicts among dominant parameters. 
However, the heating rate and maximum temperature of the TLD readout must be 
carefully set since a complex cross interaction might occur between these two 
parameters. The dynamic robust design was practically superior to the static one since 
the definition of loss function  more closely met the requirements of an actual TLD 
readout.
