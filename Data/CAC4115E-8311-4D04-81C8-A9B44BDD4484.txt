Abstract: Two external-field-free methods are presented for measuring the 
azimuthal anchoring strength in twisted nematic liquid crystal (TNLC) 
cells. For asymmetrical TNLC samples, the twist angle is derived from the 
phase of the detected signal in a phase-sensitive heterodyne polarimeter and 
is then used to calculate the weak anchoring strength directly. The 
measurement resolution which is found to be about 0.01µJ/m2 makes the 
present method sensitive enough for the LC-based bio-sensing application. 
Using the proposed method, the weak azimuthal anchoring strength of a 
composite liquid crystal mixture (40% LCT-061153 + 60% MJO-42761) in 
contact with a plasma-alignment layer is found to be 7.19 µJ/m2. For 
symmetrical TNLC samples, the liquid crystals are injected into a wedge 
cell, and the two-dimensional distributions of the twist angle and cell gap 
are extracted from the detected phase distribution using a genetic algorithm 
(GA). The azimuthal anchoring strength is then obtained by applying a 
fitting technique to the twist angle vs. cell gap curve. Utilizing the proposed 
approach, it is shown that the strong anchoring strength between a rubbed 
polyimide (PI) alignment layer and E7 liquid crystal is around 160 µJ/m2 
while that between a rubbed PI alignment layer and MLC-7023 liquid 
crystal is approximately 32 µJ/m2.

method and a GA for enabling the full characterization of a TNLC cell, including the cell 
thickness, the twist angle, the pre-tilt angle, and the azimuthal angle. 
This study proposes two external-field-free methods for measuring the weak and strong 
anchoring strengths in asymmetrically-aligned and symmetrically-aligned TNLC cells, 
respectively, using a phase-sensitive heterodyne interferometer. In the case of the 
asymmetrical TNLC cell, the cell parameters are optimized in such a way that the detected 
phase signal is rendered sensitive to the twist angle but insensitive to the cell thickness, and 
the twist angle of the sample is then extracted from the phase of the detected heterodyne 
signal. The twist angle is then used to calculate the anchoring strength directly. The proposing 
method is more sensitive than the one utilized by Govindaraju et al. [8] for quantifying 
proteins captured on surfaces through interactions with immobilized ligands and therefore is 
suitable for label-free bio-sensing application. For the symmetrical sample, the twist angle 
and cell gap of a wedge cell incorporating the LCs of interest are extracted from the 2-D 
phase distribution of the sample using a GA, and the azimuthal anchoring strength is then 
derived from the twist angle vs. cell gap curve using a fitting technique. The validity of the 
proposed weak anchoring strength measurement method is demonstrated using an 
asymmetrically-aligned TNLC cell containing a composite LC mixture of 40% LCT-061153 
and 60% MJO-42761. Meanwhile, the validity of the strong anchoring strength measurement 
method is demonstrated by measuring the anchoring strengths between a rubbed polyimide 
(PI) layer and E7 liquid crystal and MLC-7023 liquid crystal, respectively. 
2. Basic theory 
In TNLC display devices, a uniform director alignment is generally obtained using rubbed 
polymer films. When the rubbing directions on the two substrates in the cell are orientated at 
an angle to one another, the nematic LCs injected into the cell form a twisted structure as a 
result of the surface anchoring force. If the surface anchoring energy is weak (and no external 
field is applied), the twisted structure induces a deviation of the director at the cell surface 
from the easy axis of the LC alignment layer, and the deviation angle can then be used to 
estimate the magnitude of the anchoring energy. In practice, the deviation angle is determined 
by the balance between the elastic power of the twisted LC structure and the torsional effect 
of the anchoring energy. For the case of a TNLC cell containing nematic LCs doped with a 
chiral material and having substrates rubbed in anti-parallel or parallel directions, the free 
energy per unit area is given by the sum of the elastic energy Fb and the surface anchoring 
energy Fs [13], i.e.

where K22 is the twist elastic constant; d is the cell thickness; φt is the real twist angle; φ0 is 
the intrinsic pre-twist angle of the sample material and is equal to φ0 = 2πd/p where p is the 
natural pitch of the material; wφ is the azimuthal anchoring strength, and ∆φ is the deviation 
of the surface LC director from alignment (rubbing) direction. (Note that for a nematic LC 
with chiral pitch of p = ∞, φ0 = 0). 
In this study, two external-field-free methods are proposed for measuring the azimuthal 
anchoring strength in TNLC cells. In the first case, the two substrates of the TNLC cell are 
prepared in the same way such that the LCs are symmetrically aligned. As a result, an 
identical (strong) azimuthal anchoring strength is obtained at both substrates. In the second 
case, the two substrates are prepared using different methods such that a strong anchoring

In other words, the detected heterodyne signal has the form of a sinusoidal signal with the 
same angular frequency as the EOM driving voltage. As shown in Eq. (9), the detected signal 
consists of a DC term, IDC, and a modulated term, sin( )K tω σ+ . The phase σ of the 
sinusoidal term can be expressed as a function of the TNLC cell parameters ( , , )t dα φ and can 
be extracted using the phase-lock method. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the variation of the 
phase term in Eq. (9) for twist angles in the range −180° ~180° and retardation values in the 
range 0 ~2 µm. (Note that the azimuthal angle is assumed to be α = 0°.) It can be seen that the 
phase, σ, and the twist angle, φt, are linearly related at retardation values of approximately 0.3 
µm, 0.9 µm, and 1.5 µm. Furthermore, it is noted that the slope of the linearity at d∆n = 0.3

For an asymmetrical TNLC cell with a strong anchoring substrate (input surface) and a 
weak anchoring substrate (output surface), the azimuthal anchoring strength of the weak 
alignment layer can be calculated from Eq. (5) in Section 2 given a knowledge of the actual 
twist angle φt, the cell thickness d, the twist elastic constant K22 and the twist angle induced 
by the easy axis of the LC alignment layer φe. Figure 4 shows the simulation results obtained 
for the correlation between the real twist angle and the azimuthal anchoring strength of the 
weak alignment layer in a TNLC cell with parameters of φe = 120°, K22 = 7.35 pN, and d = 3 
µm. The results show that for a weak anchoring strength of around 7 µJ/m2, the measurement 
resolution of the twist angle (i.e. 0.08°) equates to an azimuthal anchoring strength resolution 
of approximately 0.01 µJ/m2, and the smaller the anchoring strength, the more sensitive the 
anchoring strength measurement.

asymmetrically-aligned TNLC cell with φe = 120°, K22 = 7.35 pN, and d = 3µm. 
3.2 Experimental setup and results for asymmetrical cells 
In setting up the heterodyne polarimeter shown in Fig. 1, a frequency stabilized He–Ne laser 
(Model: SIOS SL 02/2) with an output power of 3 mW was used as the light source and the 
EOM (Conoptics, Model 370) was driven by a saw-tooth signal with a frequency of 1 kHz. 
The phase of the detected signal was acquired using a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford 
Research Systems Inc.,). The asymmetric TNLC sample was constructed by filling an empty 
test cell (twist angle φe = 120°, pre-tilt angle 3°, and cell gap 2.91 µm) with a composite LC 
mixture (K22 = 7.35 pN) comprising 40% LCT-061153 and 60% MJO-42761. The LCs were 
aligned at the lower substrate via a PI rubbing layer and at the upper substrate by a plasma-
alignment layer. In performing the measurement process, the azimuthal angle of the entrance 
LC director was set to α = 0°. The retardation of the TNLC sample, d∆n, was estimated to be 
0.352 µm, i.e. within the optimal range of 0.3 µm ~0.38 µm. The weak azimuthal anchoring 
strength at the plasma-alignment layer was calculated from Eq. (5) using the method 
described in Subsection 3.1. Note that prior to the measurement process, the heterodyne 
signal detected without the TNLC sample in the system was calibrated in order to eliminate 
the phase effect induced by the EOM. 
Figures 5(a) ~5(c) show the correlation between the phase σ and the twist angle for 
azimuthal angles of α = 0°, 1° and −1°, respectively. Note that the value of α = 0° represents 
the optimal azimuthal angle, while the values of α =  + 1° and −1° are used to investigate the 
effect of small errors in the optimal azimuthal angle on the calculated value of the anchoring 
strength. The measured phase σ of the asymmetric TNLC sample is −67.5° ( = 292.5°). In  
Fig. 5(a), the real twist angle tφ  is found to be 80.21° at a phase σ of 292.5°. Substituting this

be obtained simply by fitting the experimental φt - d curve obtained by the GA. Note that the 
azimuthal strength obtained by fitting the multiple φt - d curves is expected to be more 
accurate than that obtained when using a sample with a uniform cell gap. 
 
Fig. 6. Simulated twist angle vs. thickness (φt - d) curves for symmetrical TNLC cells with 
different azimuthal anchoring strengths in the range 30 µJ/m2 (lower) to 150 µJ/m2 (upper). 
Figure 7 presents a schematic diagram of the measurement system utilized to measure 2-D 
parameters distributions from a TNLC cell. As shown, the configuration is modified from the 
one described in Section 3. A beam expander is used to extend the single-point methodology 
to full-field measurement and a QWP whose slow axis forms an angle of 45° with that of the 
EOM was placed at three positions, namely Position 1, Position 2, and Position 3 (see Fig. 7) 
sequentially in the measurement process. After passing the analyzer, the expanded beam is 
incident on a CCD triggered by a complex programmable logic device (CPLD) with a phase-
shift driver. As the QWP is placed at Position 1, the form of the detected signals I1 consists of 
a DC term IDC and a modulated term 1 1sin( )K tω σ+ . Similarly, as the QWP was placed at 
Position 2 and Position 3, the detected signal can be expressed as ( )2 2 2sinDCI I K tω σ= + +  
and ( )3 3 3sinDCI I K tω σ= + + , respectively. In accordance with the method presented in 
[16], the phase maps of (σ1, σ2, σ3) of heterodyne signals can be carried out as follows

The full-field distributions of the azimuthal angle α, cell thickness d and twist angle φt are 
extracted using a GA, and the strong azimuthal anchoring strength is then obtained by 
applying a fitting method to the experimental results for the twist angle vs. cell thickness.

Before inserting the sample into the experimental setup, the DC bias of the EOM was 
adjusted such that the detected signal and the driving signal were in phase (i.e., 0initialσ =  ) in 
order to eliminate the effect of the phase effect induced by the EOM. Having calibrated the 
detected signal, the sample was introduced into the measurement system and the QWP was 
inserted at Position 1 (see Fig. 7). The 2-D phase distribution, σ1, was then obtained from the 
detected signal. The QWP was then moved to Position 2, and the new 2-D phase distribution, 
σ2, was obtained. Finally, the QWP was removed from the experimental system, and the 
corresponding 2-D phase distribution, σ3, was obtained. 
Figure 9(a) presents a typical image acquired by the CCD camera of the wedge cell filled 
with E7 liquid crystals. Note that the diffraction patterns in the image are the result of small 
particles on the lens surface and interference fringes introduced by the optical components 
within the interferometer. Figures 9(b)–10(d) show the corresponding 2-D distributions of σ1, 
σ2, and σ3.

(b)~(d): phase distributions σ1 ~σ3 for sample shown in (a). 
The measured 2-D phase distributions (σ1, σ2, σ3) were substituted into the GA as the 
objective values for the error function, and the optimal values of α , tφ , and d (i.e. the 
parameter values which minimized the error function) were extracted. In Eq. (9), it can be 
seen that the phase term of the detected signal varies as a function of cos2X. That is, as the 
cell gap d increases, the term 2 2 1/ 2[ ( / 2) ]tφΧ = + Γ  also increases, and cos2X varies 
periodically between −1 and 1. Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the variations of terms A and B 
in Eq. (9) as a function of d. The periodic properties of A and B lead to a corresponding 
periodicity in the measured phase distributions. This phenomenon is inevitable, and causes 
the GA to extract multiple solutions for the TNLC parameters if the search space for the cell

折射材料及扭轉型液晶盒參數的可行性。光學外差式偏光架構對於相位量測具有高
度靈敏性，而所得的各參數與設計值十分接近。本系統除了可快速的得到液晶盒厚
度之分佈，可用於對於液晶線上製程檢測，亦可穩定的同時量測扭轉向列型液晶的
方位角、扭轉角及液晶盒厚及方位角錨定能等參數，對於光學非等向性材料之特性
分析提供有力之工具。 
 
藉由光學外差共路徑干涉的量測架構，可降低環境擾動對於訊號的影響，並改
善訊噪比(signal-to-noise ratio)。以外差干涉訊號的相位及強度比作為多目標基因演
算法中的目標值，可找出最適合的基因(即液晶參數)來對應到所要之目標值，此方
法用於量測扭轉向列型液晶盒的入射液晶導軸方位角、扭轉角以及液晶盒厚度之精
度甚高；而以外差訊號之二維相位分佈作為目標值，更可同時求出液晶盒的入射液
晶導軸方位角、扭轉角以及液晶盒厚度之二維分佈。研究中更進一步以楔型液晶盒
為樣本，量測其扭轉角及厚度分布，進而求出液晶與 polyimide 之方位角錨定能，
此方法毋須外加電場或磁場，待測樣本亦不需符合 waveguiding regime 之特殊條件。 
 
本計畫所發展的量測技術對國內的面板產業將有明顯助益，且可向更多領域擴
展延伸，拓展其應用範圍。研究成果亦有多篇論文被 Optics Express 等光學領域頂尖
國際期刊接受。因此，國科會所支持本計畫所得技術與衍生之研究成果相當豐碩。

conference 整個行程, 可謂相當忙碌; 會餘時間，本人逛了一下在會場展出
的書展及實驗器材展。在會場同時並有機械 , 光學量測儀器如 Trilion,
Bose, Lavison, 及 DIC 相關技術等著名廠商及 Experimetnal Mechanic 及
Experimetnal Techniques 期刊書籍展示; 在會議中並結交了多位新朋友。大
家除了交換研究經練外，亦討論了有關教育及目前國內外熱門的研究課
題。
(二）與會心得與建議：
本大會的規模頗為龐大。大家除了交換研究經練，結交新朋友外，亦
交換其他方面的觀念。希望國內的研究人員能和國外的研究團體多交
流，並提早得知國外的研究動態。此次研討會與本屆 2009-2010 SEM
