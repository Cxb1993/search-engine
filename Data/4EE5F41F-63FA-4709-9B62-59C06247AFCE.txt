I. Introduction 
Transportation technology is one of the most influential areas in the human life. Many 
researchers have been involved in a wide scope of related research activities aiming to enhance 
efficiency, comfort, and safety of transportation systems. Among them, the traffic congestion is a 
global problem. One solution of this problem is to increase the traffic flow by decreasing the 
inter-vehicular spacing. To achieve this objective, car following for traffic safety has been an 
active area of research [1, 2]. However, human driving involves reaction time, delay, and human 
error that affect safe driving adversely. One way to eliminate human error and delay in vehicle 
following is to integrate an automated car-following control system in the driving system. Inside 
the vehicle platoon, each vehicle should follow the preceding vehicle with a safety clearance. To 
enable this, each vehicle will be equipped with control systems which coordinate control between 
the brakes, engine and steering subsystems. Advanced electronic technology has brought the 
revolution into the development of intelligent transportation systems, and been applied to many 
diverse elements of the automobile. One way of change to driving is coming as the technology 
which is applied to collision avoidance along with driver interface designs and vehicle control 
systems. Studies have shown that driver errors are determined to be a definite and major factor 
for crash causes. Among multi-vehicle crashes, the rear-end type is the most common considered 
into the driver’s assists at present.  
Adaptive cruise control (ACC) and forward collision warning systems are two key 
technologies for the extension of the driver’s awareness and senses to correct inattention, bad 
following habits, and perceptual biases. Currently ACC systems [3]-[7] are being developed by 
enhancing cruise control with the ability to maintain a desired headway with respect to a forward 
vehicle which has been detected. During the safe headway adaptation by ACC systems, the 
human intervention is normally unnecessary. However, due to the comfort consideration in ACC 
systems [8], the limitation of speed changing would yield the non-effective braking for critical 
situations such as immediate collision. The operational limits should be clearly conveyed to the 
driver. Therefore, it will be essential to design a headway adaptation (HA) system that will 
cooperate or integrate with the collision avoidance (CA) strategy. Such an integrated system 
would not only adapt the speed of the vehicle but also advise the driver of a collision to avoid that 
performance with desired attenuation level. Moreover, all the parameter learning algorithms are 
derived based on the Lyapunov function, thus the system stability can be guaranteed. Finally, two 
simulation scenarios (one-vehicle following scenario and multi-vehicles following scenario) are 
examined to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SSFNNC. 
While the design in the HA/CA strategy is based on the vehicle kinematics, the design of the 
body-level (throttle /brake) controller requires the well-developed techniques against the 
challenge due to the complexity in the sub- components of vehicles. Even to different vehicles, a 
normal driver can be expected to drive well; this evidence motivates the application of human 
reasoning approach. 
 
II. System Design Methodology 
A. System Configuration 
 
Fig. 1.  Functional HA/CA elements. 
The main function of HA/CA system is to control vehicle speed adaptively to a forward vehicle 
which is detected by the forward-looking sensor. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the HA/CA system is 
composed of a supervisory control and a regulation control and is configured with a hierarchical 
structure. One of the most advantages to this system structure is that once the lower level control 
is developed specifically for another vehicle, the upper level control can be designed without 
much modification due to detailed changes.  
The strategies for HA and CA are integrated in the supervisory control which utilizes the 
B. HA/CA Integration Design 
 
 
Fig. 2.  Architecture flow diagram for the integrated HA/CA system. 
To enable the HA and CA strategy to work in collaboration, the supervisory control is 
developed with an integrated architecture. As in Fig. 2, there are two processing modules with 
regard to HA and CA strategy in the architecture flow diagram and for the intelligent functioning 
of the HA/CA system. The required states for the system processing are the measured headway 
distance and the speed of the subject vehicle. The main function in this diagram is to calculate the 
safe speed for the subject vehicle based on the emergency evaluation from the CA strategy. Then 
the commanded speed is executed by the regulation control which adjusts the throttle and brake 
of vehicle to keep the safe spacing to the vehicle ahead. The warning information is also 
displayed to the human driver who can determine whether the braking should be intervened or 
not. In the following sections, the designing approach to the supervisory and the regulation 
control will be introduced, respectively. 
 
III. Supervisory Control Design 
A. CA Strategy 
There are two stages in the CA strategy. The first stage is the computation of warning 
distance for the normal warning situation, while the second stage is the computation of braking 
distance for the guarantee of collision avoidance. It is possible for a driver to begin a driving 
presented as

d V aτ τ−= +                           (3) 
where vrel=vf −vp are the relative velocity at initial time t0 . 
To avoid the discontinuity which exists in the switch between the warning distance and the 
braking distance, an evaluate signal (ES) based on the rational form [16] is given as

Remark: The accelerations of the preceding and the following vehicle are both assumed with the 
same maximum values, and vp is replaced by vrel , then the warning distance defined in (1) can be 
rewritten as

where the augmented offset d0 is essential to be sure that dw_CA -dbr > 0; otherwise, the value of Iw 
will be positive for indicating safety while dr < dbr.  
By examining the braking distance in (3) and the modified warning distance in (5), the low bound 
of d0 shall be reasonably constrained to the value 2max totala τ− /2 such that dw_CA > dbr is guaranteed. 
The evaluate signal in (4) can give a graded display about the event likelihood for the driver. 
While dr < dw_HA , where dw_HA is determined from (5) but with general deceleration in the HA 
strategy, the headway distance is under brake control and thus not in the filed of CA strategy. The 
condition of Iw > 1 corresponds to dr > dw_CA , and it denotes that the headway distance is safe for 
driving. The condition of 0 < Iw < 1 corresponds to dbr < dr < dw_CA, and this range can be divided 
into several graded degrees for warnings. If Iw ≤ 0, then this condition corresponds to dr ≤ dbr and 
the emergency braking should immediately be activated. 
In general the values for all parameters used in the CA strategy can be referred to ISO 15623 
in which the statistics are specified from many practical tests. The maximum deceleration for the 
preceding and the following vehicle are both given as 6 m/s2, and the delay time for the human 
and the braking system is chosen as 0.6 s and 0.2 s, respectively. Figure 4 plots the simulation 
results of the proposed CA strategy. The initial headway between two vehicles is 17 m, and the 
leading vehicle decelerates with rate of 6 m/s2 . The following vehicle applies the deceleration 
rate 6 m/s2 while Iw ≤ 0, and the final stop distance is 0.32 m with respect to the leading vehicle.

In scenario 2, assumes that three FVs follow the LV with the safety space =15m. The

IV. Regulation Control Design 
 
Fig. 11.  Regulation control structure. 
As illustrated in Fig. 11, a single-input FLC (SFLC) with a proportional-derivative (PD) 
control is proposed for the throttle and the brake control. The inputs to the PD-type SFLC are 
speed error and error change, and the controller output is the driving voltage for the motor driver. 
 Fig. 12(a).  Membership functions of SFLC input. 
 
Fig. 12(b).  Membership functions of SFLC output. 
 
For the case of Ds > 0, the summation of speed error and error change is positive and it 
implies that the throttle should be acted to achieve the desired speed. On the contrary, the case of 
Ds < db implies that the bake should be acted to decelerate. The error change in Ds can improve 
the controlling response for instant variance in vehicle speed. It should be noted that the 
normalized universe of discourse of the driving voltage is limited to the range [0, 1] and negative 
voltages (corresponding to negative values of u in Fig. 12(b)) can not provide inverse torques 
from the throttle motor. Therefore, the negative voltage can be output into the brake driver for 
active deceleration control. In other words, the SFLC is designed to provide a positive voltage 
with regard to acceleration for the throttle driver while provide a negative voltage with regard to 
deceleration for the brake motor. By using an inverse operation, the negative voltage can be 
inverted to the brake motor. Due to this nature of input voltage to motor drivers, the switch 
between the throttle and the brake control can be directly constructed. As a result, only the 
throttle will be acted if the requested speed is greater than the current speed; otherwise, only the 
brake will be acted whenever the vehicle is required to be decelerated (Ds < db). Thereby, the 
situation of both throttle and brake being active can be prevented. This approach is similar to the 
behavior of human drivers.

Fig. 14(c).  Crucial warning car-following display. 
The algorithms are developed to function both in highway conditions of high speeds, and in 
urban-like conditions of low speeds with obstacles such as parked cars and pedestrians on the 
track. Figure 14 shows the warning graded display which is divided into 8 grades according to the 
evaluate signal of the CA strategy. This experiment was conducted in the No. 68 expressway in 
Taiwan. The time gap was set as 1.5 s for the integrated HA/CA system. In Fig. 14(a), the forward 
vehicle was out of the range of HA control, and the subject vehicle cruised with the 
driver-selected speed 73 km/h which was safe. As shown in Fig. 14(b), the warning graded 
display suggested to the driver that the distance to the vehicle in front is insufficient for the 
current speed; meanwhile, the HA control then applied the brake to make the graded display back 
to green grade. In Fig. 14(c), the HA control was disable for only testing of the CA strategy. The 
graded display gave red alarm to indicate that it was under crucial warning for this speed and 
The integration HA/CA system consists of the supervisory control and the regulation control 
with a hierarchical structure. The stability of car-following can be ensured based on the 
developed intelligent longitudinal control system via the self-structuring fuzzy neural network 
(SFNN) approach and adaptive control approach for the vehicle-following system. The on-line 
adaptation laws of the proposed self-structuring fuzzy neural network control scheme are derived 
based on the Lyapunov stability theorem, so that the tracking stability can be guaranteed for the 
control system. In the SFNN design, a dynamic rule generating/elimination mechanism is 
developed to cope with the tradeoff between the approximation accuracy and computational 
loading. Finally, two different simulation scenarios are carried out and simulation results have 
demonstrated that the proposed control system can achieve favorable tracking performance for 
the vehicle-following control even under the leading vehicles safety space change and 
acceleration maneuver.  
As to the regulation control design which is based on the soft-computing technique, the 
throttle/brake can be controlled in such a way of human reasoning without need of the detailed 
complex vehicle model. Finally, the integrated HA/CA system is implemented on the real vehicle, 
namely Taiwan iTS-1, and has been tested in real traffic phase, both at highway speeds and in 
stop-to-go situations.
