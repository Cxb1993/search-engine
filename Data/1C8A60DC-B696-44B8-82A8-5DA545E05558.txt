I以眼球追蹤法探索視覺故事敘述之人物與文字之注視軌跡
摘 要
隨著後現代思潮、敘述學與解構主義的興起，影像文本的故事性、趣味性已變成吸引
注意力的重要手法，訴說者與閱讀者間的互動也成為影像閱讀的新形式，圖與文之間的關
係更被重新界定。本研究假設：手寫式日記式的文字、角色人物介紹文字，將會比傳統廣
告文案，更引起閱讀注意力，更添加故事感(storyness)。實驗採取眼球追蹤法，兩組內容不
同樣本，各包含有實驗組(豐富文案)與對照組(僅有簡單標語或商標)，針對設計背景與非設
計背景者進行實驗測試。結果發現，非設計背景者瀏覽圖像的時間，是設計背景者的兩倍。
瀏覽起始點，大都放在圖片中間或左上方的人物臉部。瀏覽終點，有的放回在圖片中間，
有的則停留在線性軌跡的末端。對於豐富的文案，受測者都花更多的時間瀏覽，且有六到
九成的時間分配在文案上。對於較少的人物簡介文字，受測者則會在看過文字後，軌跡再
移回到該人物。研究也回應過去學者所說的，受測者對人的表情最有興趣，閱讀解釋或註
解式的文字後，受測者會來回到人物或尋求有意義中心點來回檢視等議題。
關鍵字：視覺故事敘述、眼球追蹤法、圖像、文字、閱讀互動
Abstract
As the trend of Post-modernism, Narratology, Deconstruction is emerging, the storyness and
interest in design becomes the significant device to get audiences’ atention. And the Interaction 
between designers and image readers also has been valued, while the relationship between images
and text being re-defined. This paper presumes the text written by diary style and by the way of
character description instead of formal typing and mediocre copy will add the storyness and
increase interest to the audiences. Adopting the technique of eye tracking, this paper employs two
sets of samples with different content which includes experimental group (with abundant text)
and control group (with slogan and logo only). Eight subjects with 4 design background and 4
non-design background have been enrolled. We find that the subjects with non-design
background take twice of time to view the advertisement. The initiate journey locates on the
center or figure’s face around the left / middle part and the end of eye trace has been back to
center again while partly subject ends the route wherever they like. Most of subjects take more
time to see the experimental sample and put the 60-90% time to browse abundant text. However,
they bound back to the figures after viewing the simple text of character description. The research
also responses tothe scholars’ finding in the weight of figure face and meaningful focus points.
Keywords: Visual story narration, Eye tracking, Images, text, reading interaction
23.1.2圖文並陳的眼球運動
關於圖文並陳的研究，伊彬、林演慶(2006)舉學者 Finn、Andreson等之說法，認為圖
像較文字注意優先；在平面廣告注視持續時間中，超過 70%投注在圖片上，15%在標題，
其他則是內文。對於廣告直指(explicit)產品與廣告不言明(implicit)產品(如推論、隱喻、類
比)等實驗，結果發現觀眾對於隱諱式的廣告，圖文間的眼睛跳動行為頻繁，會投予較多的
時間、正面態度與興趣。對於線條漫畫與說明文字為刺激物的實驗，結果發現注視會短暫
停留在漫畫上，比如說只有三個注視點，再仔細的去閱讀說明文字，然後又回到漫畫上，
這一次會花比較多的時間停留，但會停留在文字說明中提到的物件或角色，只有少數的證
據顯示注視會在文字與圖形間游移，觀者傾向於閱讀整個文字後，才會回到圖形。
3.2 圖像提供對話、互動與情感
3.2.1對話過程
Kress and Leeuwen (2000)認為不同的敘述性過程可依箭頭的種類、參與者數目種類來
區分：動作過程、反應過程、對話過程與思考過程、轉換過程、幾何式符號表現，與情境。
其中的對話過程(Speech Process)，學者舉漫畫之例，由箭頭連接說話者或思考者和他們說
的話、或想法之思考圈圈(thought ballons)或對話圈圈( dialogue ballons)。這種類似中世紀藝
術的對話過程，如今漸漸被廣泛運用在海報、教科書、產品廣告等媒介上。這類結構被
Halliday稱為「突顯性結構」(projective)，雖非直接表現，卻間接透露察覺者(Senser)、或說
話者(Speaker)的想法。
3.2.2互動要求
對於圖像內容物與觀看者的互動，Kress and Leeuwen (2000)也提出「要求」(demand)
「提供」(offfer)兩種視覺組態。前者「要求」，會因為對圖像中人物的注目、手勢、動作或
箭頭等，或明確地確認觀看者「你」，與觀看者產生假想關係，並產生聯繫、一起加入一種
社會連結的關係。相反地，後者的圖像內容物僅被視為資料項目、沈思對象，如展示櫥窗
標本般。

4左側涵蓋往往我們「已知訊息」，是讀者已知之事實或文化背景，而全新的訊息、或欲告之
的主題，則會安排在右側。另外，上下的編排，設計者往往將上半部做「情感訴求」--讓我
們知道可能會有的美好結果，下半的編排則是資訊性的「實際是甚麼」。
至於報紙版面的編排，大都由左至右、由上至下去考量其重要性，唐大崙、莊賢智(2004)
針對這類內省的結論，以眼球追蹤追蹤注意力分布，則發現圖片置左，使得圖片受到比圖
片置右獲得更多且短暫的凝視落點。
圖二：圖左側是已知資料、右側則是全新或欲告
知之主題。
圖三：圖上方強調情

四、研究方法

依變項：視線總凝視時間、視線跳躍路徑、視線起始點與終點
4.2 研究工具
4.2.1實驗樣本：
本實驗兩組樣本採美國 Living Magazine 2007九月到十二月間之American Express信用
卡廣告(樣本 A)、及美國 C'N'C' CoSTUME NATIONAL時裝在台之促銷 DM圖片(樣本 B)。
為避免受測者因為英語閱讀之障礙，除商品 LOGO外，皆將文案翻譯，以 Photoshop繪圖
軟體、或手寫修改為中文文案。
其中樣本 A-2(實驗組)為原廣告之圖形，只做翻譯修改；樣本 A-1(對照組)則去掉文案，
放大原圖中產品與主要標語。樣本 B-2(實驗組)為原廣告之圖形，只做翻譯修改；樣本 B-1(對
照組)則去掉文案，僅保留原圖商標。
6樣本 B-1較久。其中樣本 A-2因為有較多的資訊，總平均多了將近 12秒。樣本 B-2，因為
介紹的文案不多，加上受測者對圖像有記憶，故瀏覽總平均幾乎相同。值得注意的是，設
計背景學生對四張圖的平均瀏覽時間僅有 13.96秒，而非設計背景學生對四張圖的平均瀏
覽時間共 26.93秒，所花費時間將近兩倍。

5.2 瀏覽路徑
*樣本 A-1：受測者皆先注視畫面左邊豐富的圖片內容，再移動到左邊。其中非設計背景的
受測者停留在左側圖的時間較長(約五分之四)，接著移動到右側，看完右側產品與標語後，
即宣告完成。而設計背景的受測者停留在左側圖的時間(約三分之二)，接著移動到右側，看
完右側產品與標語後，會再移到左邊圖像內容。
*樣本 A-2：因受測者皆對前一張畫面有印象，所以大部分受測者都把六成到九成的時間放
在右側許多文字資訊的部分。有人先再看圖，有人直接閱讀右側的文字。(只有編號 7，對
新的文字內容僅付出三成時間。)
*樣本 B-1：受測者幾乎都先看左上角女孩的臉，再移到右中下男孩的臉，再移到左下的商
標，但由於本產品商標在台灣並非被普遍認識，因此商標被停留的時間很短暫。
*樣本 B-1：受測者眼睛很快閱讀女孩旁的文字，然後是男孩旁的文字，也會在看完文字再
移動回臉部。
5.3 瀏覽起始點、結束點
*樣本 A-1：起始點大都從中間，或左上部、或嬰兒的臉開始。
*樣本 A-2：結束點大都回到左圖短暫的停留。
*樣本 B-1：起始點大都從女孩臉部開始。
*樣本 B-2：起始點有的從中間點迅速移開，大部分從女孩臉部開始、快速移到女孩右側的
文字。結束點，有的會在回到女孩。
六、結論與建議
本研究結果發現，非設計背景者瀏覽圖像的時間，是設計背景者的兩倍。瀏覽起始點，大
都放在圖片中間或左上方的人物臉部。瀏覽終點，有的放回在圖片中間，有的則停留在線
性軌跡的末端。對於豐富的文案，受測者都給予六到九成的時間分配。對於較少的人物簡

          論文發表之學習與心得、Seoul Design Olympiad 2009 參觀心得 
 
(一) 大會主要演講者 Donald A. Norman 與 Elizabeth B.-N. Sanders 之演講心得 
著名的 Donald A. Norman，專長在認知心理學、與互動人機介面。他著有「設
計心理學」(又稱設計&日常生活)與「情感設計」專書，是國內學工業設計領域
師生人人必讀的經典書籍，他在第一本書中過度強調的易用性，於情感設計中大
幅修正其觀念，認為產品設計不是功用處方就可以解決，他開始強調物的情感部
分，認為吸引人的設計不一定是效率最高的設計。 
Norman 原本計畫在大會要講的題目是 Science and Design，但他後來改以對
Design Research 之質疑來開場，他問到許多第一件好的產品，有用到設計研究嗎?
不，他認為所謂 Right tech 與 right application，不見得可以成功，反而是 right needs
符合恰當的時機與人類的需要，才是重要。一件好的創新作品，其實來自對人類
的觀察。Norman 認為所謂的 science 是一種爭辯的過程，建構在可討論、可驗證
的精神上。(這其實是與設計研究的精神很像的)，他認為要跨越 idea 與 production
的鴻溝，只有用科學的方法(Scientific methods)去面對，用一套科學式的系統方法
去建立、去爭辯、去重複驗證出知識的實體來。 
另外一位演講者是 Elizabeth B.-N. Sanders，Sanders 目前是 Ohio State 
University 的教授，也是 MakeTools 公司的創立人，其客戶包括 3M, AT&T, Coca Cola, 
Compaq, IBM, Intel, Kodak, Microsoft, Motorola, Philips, Xerox 等。原本背景是心理
學與人類學，後來以人本設計見長。 
Sanders 提出 Co-creation 的觀念，她認為這部是新觀念，而是我們以身在其
中。要達到 Co-creation，需要建立新的方法、新的工具去連接、去創造、去分享。
而要達到這個願景，就是要大家保持新的態度去關懷那些消費者與使用者。

postmodern trend that is shown on architecture work at the very beginning and gets prevailed to visual 
communication design later. They are categorized by Yang[6] and other scholars as old-fashioned, ironic and 
imitative, local, high-tech, ideological, overlapping text, digital, photography skills and overlay, context, and 
narrative styles. Currently when scholars talk about narrative design, they emphasize “theme, subject, motif” 
strategies, and stress on brainstorming and completion of design end. Our research aims to study story perception 
and emotional experience of readers for graphic design. We will use the findings to reconsider the story and story 
narration from the designer’s perspective.  
 
1.1 Definition of terms: 
1. “Story”：includes people and moving objects. These incidents are associated through time order and cause 
and effect logic which enable people’s curiosity to explore. 
2. “Storytelling”：discuss the phenomenon, issue and overcoming of subjects when turning the written stories 
into oral stories, and explore the subtle interaction between storytellers and audiences. 
3. “Storytelling by graphic design”：instant presentation of extension of visual story, with image showing 
character, time, space, cause and effect and other symbols. 
4. “Storyness”：the impact the story has on readers. 
 
2. Literature review 
2.1 Visual communication and representation structure 
Early hunters traced the tracks left by their preys, and these tracks can be viewed as simple image symbols. 
These symbols are rather rudimentary in the eyes of today’s people – who are buried under complex signals 
daily – but through observation and analysis, these imagery symbols can be used to visualize the prey’s action.  
Whether it is symbols, pictures, or between pictures, each new combination might enable a brand-new meaning 
through special arrangement by designers[2]. Arrangement of text and picture, forming of meaning, 
psychological association and behavior response, lead to a series of interactions between designers and audiences.   
 
Before the end of 19th century, poster designers tend to follow esthetics perspective normally instead of product 
style or symbolizing certain concept, such as Scheler, Lautrec and Mucha for Art Nouveau. In 1950s, U.S. 
graphic designer Paul Rand has advocated “one concept delivered per work” [2] in terms of a combination of 
picture and text, where text and picture are independent from esthetics point of view. In fact, graphic design has 
been obviously affected by Art Nouveau, DADA, Art Deco, POP Art and postmodernism since the end of 19th 
century, which is divided into “Narrative” and “Conceptual” two major types in terms of visual representation 
structure.

As for the role of graphic design readers, Paul Rand has proposed concept of “The New Advertising” early in 
1950s, i.e. “role of audiences is no longer passive but active as they have to be curious and spend time thinking 
about the meaning of work during appreciation process of one design work.”[2] 
 
Originated from 1960s, 1970s, reader’s response criticism is affected by deconstruction, which believes that the 
conversation between work and interpreter is infinite, with representation of definite meaning along passage or 
sliding of “Chain of Signifier”, fun of reading lies in participating this infinite free game [1] which is different 
from directing readers to united activity to view work [2] and challenges for text meaning that allows to rule 
readers, concepts created by readers. In which it not only involves an understanding of reproduction of text 
meaning but also involves new meaning generated by readers. Generally speaking, this kind of readers includes 
text readers, image readers, even viewers of other art patterns. However, storytelling of graphic design also 
echoes the reader’s active interpretation, prolonged imagination concept. 
 
Regarding the affection delivery effect, what makes visual message a powerful communication pattern is the 
stimulations it brings to the mind and emotion that allow us to think and feel [4]. We accept and decode those 
messages and also, acknowledge the feeling enabled by those messages, which is also the most frequent 
technique used on Ad. In Ad marketing scholars’ point of view, humans showing tendency of certain affection is 
advantageous for the enhancement of people’s emotional experience. In other words, people’s feeling towards 
media contents “stimulates” affection. Advertisement for instance, will cause emotional tendency of audiences. 
If this tendency is meaningful to people’s life, symbolic meaning in particular, the emotional experience will rise 
and affect consumers’ decisions and behaviors. Such an affection delivery effect is also one of the features of 
story narration in graphic design. 
 
3. Research Methods 
3.1 Research framework 
The research employs Likert scale, factor analysis and conducts analysis on open coding questionnaire, to 
explore readers’ viewpoints on storyness of graphic design, with samples selected from advertisements between 
Sept.~Dec., 2007 in Living Magazine which focus on improving the quality of home life. Its Ads focuses on 
daily appliances and female health care. It is suitable for exploring the story narration of graphic design. The 
magazine features esthetics and quality with certain standard of design quality for Ad. Respondents will not be 
affected by different quality of product design. The script of Ad is written in English. To avoid error judgment of 
respondents due to different cultural background and language misunderstanding, each picture will be briefed 
orally in Chinese, which is the native language of respondents.  
 
The research is divided into 2 stages, with Likert scale, factor analysis and strength analysis of story conducted 
on the 36 graphic designs and with top 5 Ads selected by each respondent. In stage 1, the top 12 pictures selected 
by participants will be indicated. In stage 2, researcher will analyze the reasons why respondents consider the 
pictures with strong storyness include visual composition through open coding in terms of the 12 pictures 
selected in stage 1.

4.3 Analysis of storyness strength：visual message receiving, personal cognition, positive 
affection identity, sense of drama 
According to stage 2, respondents analyze the top 5 strong stories selected by them in open question. They 
express the visual composition in their own feelings, the most common reason they mention are due to personal 
emotional experiences. After these two major concepts were categorized, there are visual composition such as : 1) 
gesture and eye-contact of main character, 2) diary or scrawling text, 3) the hint of story background, 4) the 
obviousness of theme, 5) dramatic and imaginary space, 6) fairy tale and reminiscence, 7) contrast or special 
layout, 8) full of clues and dialogue box while in “emotional experience”, there are : 1) positive affection, 2) 
impressiveness and familiarity, 3) expectation to outcome, 4) plot felt, 5) message perceiving. The analysis 
structure is shown in figure 3.
10 
 
culture identity and weaker storyness strength if positive affection is not enabled. Printed text reports weaken 
storyness strength more than handwriting or scrawling text.  
 
Besides, storyness strength shown in visual composition with cause-effect relationship, “narrative” visual 
composition with directional feature, “conceptual” visual composition with stability and with overlap in between. 
The relationship will be discussed in further research. Also, the research will continue to develop questionnaires 
to explore the cognition and emotional differences between professionals and non-professionals. The researchers 
hope to expand the experiment to different media and include participants of all ages. By doing this, we will 
have a better understanding of the “total situation for storyness narration” model and apply the findings on visual 
communication review, teaching and design practices.

As for the role of graphic design readers, Paul Rand has proposed concept of “The New Advertising” early in 
1950s, i.e. “role of audiences is no longer passive but active as they have to be curious and spend time thinking 
about the meaning of work during appreciation process of one design work.”[2] 
 
Originated from 1960s, 1970s, reader’s response criticism is affected by deconstruction, which believes that the 
conversation between work and interpreter is infinite, with representation of definite meaning along passage or 
sliding of “Chain of Signifier”, fun of reading lies in participating this infinite free game [1] which is different 
from directing readers to united activity to view work [2] and challenges for text meaning that allows to rule 
readers, concepts created by readers. In which it not only involves an understanding of reproduction of text 
meaning but also involves new meaning generated by readers. Generally speaking, this kind of readers includes 
text readers, image readers, even viewers of other art patterns. However, storytelling of graphic design also 
echoes the reader’s active interpretation, prolonged imagination concept. 
 
Regarding the affection delivery effect, what makes visual message a powerful communication pattern is the 
stimulations it brings to the mind and emotion that allow us to think and feel [4]. We accept and decode those 
messages and also, acknowledge the feeling enabled by those messages, which is also the most frequent 
technique used on Ad. In Ad marketing scholars’ point of view, humans showing tendency of certain affection is 
advantageous for the enhancement of people’s emotional experience. In other words, people’s feeling towards 
media contents “stimulates” affection. Advertisement for instance, will cause emotional tendency of audiences. 
If this tendency is meaningful to people’s life, symbolic meaning in particular, the emotional experience will rise 
and affect consumers’ decisions and behaviors. Such an affection delivery effect is also one of the features of 
story narration in graphic design. 
 
3. Research Methods 
3.1 Research framework 
The research employs Likert scale, factor analysis and conducts analysis on open coding questionnaire, to 
explore readers’ viewpoints on storyness of graphic design, with samples selected from advertisements between 
Sept.~Dec., 2007 in Living Magazine which focus on improving the quality of home life. Its Ads focuses on 
daily appliances and female health care. It is suitable for exploring the story narration of graphic design. The 
magazine features esthetics and quality with certain standard of design quality for Ad. Respondents will not be 
affected by different quality of product design. The script of Ad is written in English. To avoid error judgment of 
respondents due to different cultural background and language misunderstanding, each picture will be briefed 
orally in Chinese, which is the native language of respondents.  
 
The research is divided into 2 stages, with Likert scale, factor analysis and strength analysis of story conducted 
on the 36 graphic designs and with top 5 Ads selected by each respondent. In stage 1, the top 12 pictures selected 
by participants will be indicated. In stage 2, researcher will analyze the reasons why respondents consider the 
pictures with strong storyness include visual composition through open coding in terms of the 12 pictures 
selected in stage 1.
