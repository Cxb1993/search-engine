於 i≠j 以及當 i ∈ {1, 2, …, n(G) −1}時，ui 是與 ui+1 相連接的且 un(G)是與 u1 相連接的，其
中 n(G)是代表圖形 G 中的點數。點 u1 是起始點且 ui代表是第 i 個點。如果稱圖形 G 中的
兩個漢米爾頓圈 C1 = 〈u1, u2, …, un(G), u1〉 和 C2 = 〈v1, v2, …, vn(G), v1〉 是獨立的，是因為 u1 
= v1 且對於 i ∈ {2, 3, …, n(G)}，會使得 ui ≠ vi。如果稱圖形 G 中的一個漢米爾頓圈之集合
{C1, C2, …, Ck}為相互獨立的，是因為集合中的元素都是兩兩互相獨立的。圖形 G 中相互

如果稱一個二部圖 B 為二部泛圈性，是圖形 B 中包含所有偶數長度從 4 到 |V(B)|。
如果稱一個二部漢米爾頓圖形 B 為二部泛定位性，是因為對於任意兩個相異點 x 和 y 在

1. 前言、研究目的及文獻探討 
An interconnection network connects the processors of parallel computers. Its 
architecture can be represented as a graph in which the vertices correspond to 
processors and the edges correspond to connections. Hence, we use graphs and 
networks interchangeably. There are many mutually conflicting requirements in 
designing the topology for computer networks. 
 In 1969, Lovász [1] asked whether every finite connected vertex transitive 
graph has a hamiltonian path, that is, a simple path that traverses every vertex exactly 
once. All known vertex transitive graphs have a hamiltonian path and moreover, only 
four vertex transitive graphs without a hamiltonian cycle are known. Since none of 
these four graphs is a Cayley graph there is a folklore conjecture [2] that every Cayley 
graph with more than two vertices has a hamiltonian cycle. In the last decades this 
problem was extensively studied (see [3-13]) and for those Cayley graphs for which 
the existence of hamiltonian cycles is already proven, further properties related to this 
problem, such as edge-hamiltonicity, Hamiltonconnectivity and Hamilton-laceability, 
are investigated (see [5,14]). In this project, we introduce one of such properties, the 
concept of mutually independent hamiltonian cycles which is related to the number of 
hamiltonian cycles in a given graph. In particular, mutually independent hamiltonian 
cycles of pancake graphs Pn and star graphs Sn. 
The concept of mutually independent hamiltonian arises from the following 
application. If there are k pieces of data needed to be sent from u to v, and the data 
needed to be processed at every node (and the process takes times), then we want 
mutually independent hamiltonian paths so that there will be no waiting time at a 
processor. The existence of mutually independent hamiltonian paths is useful for 
communication algorithms. Motivated by this result, we begin the study on graphs 
with mutually independent hamiltonian paths between every pair of distinct vertices. 
The n-dimensional star network Sn was proposed in [15] as n attractive 
alternative to the n-cube topology for interconnecting processors in parallel computers. 
Since its introduction, the network has received considerable attention. Akers and 
Krishnameurthy [15] showed that the star graphs are vertex transitive and edge 
transitive. The diameter and fault diameters were computed in [15-17]. The 
hamiltonian and hamiltonian laceability of star graphs are studied in [18-22]. The 
spanning container of star graph is studied in [23].

graph G is edge-bipancyclic if for any edge in G, there is a cycle of every even length 
from 4 to |V(G)| traversing through this edge. The concept of edge-bipancyclic was 
proposed by Alspach and Hare [38]. A bipartite graph G is vertex-bipancyclic if for 
any vertex in G, there is a cycle of every even length from 4 to |V(G)| going through 
this vertex. The concept of vertex-bipancyclic was proposed by Hobbs [39]. 
Obviously, every edge-bipancyclic graph is vertex-bipancyclic. It is proved that the 
hypercube Qn is edge-bipancyclic if n ≥ 2 [34]. 
We propose a more interesting property about hypercubes. A k-cycle is a cycle of 
length k. A bipartite graph G is k-cycle bipanpositionable if for every different 
vertices x and y of G and for any integer l with dG(x, y) ≤ l ≤ k/2 and (l − dG(x, y)) 
being even, there exists a k-cycle C of G such that dC(x, y) = l. (Note that dC(x, y) ≤ k/2 
for every cycle C of length k.) A bipartite graph G is bipanpositionable bipancyclic if 
G is k-cycle bipanpositionable for every even integer k with 4 ≤ k ≤ |V(G)|. 
In this project, we have proven that IHC(P3) = 1, IHC(Pn) = n − 1 if n ≥ 4, 
IHC(Sn) = n − 2 if n ∈ {3, 4} and IHC(Sn) = n − 1 if n ≥ 5, and the hypercube Qn is 
bipanpositionable bipancyclic for n ≥ 2.

viewed as a generalization of Latin rectangles. Perhaps one of the most interesting 
topics in Latin square is orthogonal Latin square. Two Latin squares of order n are 
orthogonal if the n-squared pairs formed by juxtaposing the two arrays are all distinct. 
Similarly, two Latin rectangles of order n × m are orthogonal if the n × m pairs formed 
by juxtaposing the two arrays are all distinct. With this in mind, let G be a 
Hamiltonian graph and C1 and C2 be two sets of mutually independent hamiltonian 
cycles of G from a given vertex x. We say C1 and C2 are orthogonal if their 
corresponding Latin rectangles are orthogonal. 
We can also discuss mutually independent hamiltonian paths for some graphs. 
Let P1 = 〈v1, v2, …, vn〉 and P2 = 〈u1, u2, …, un〉 be two hamiltonian paths of a graph G. 
We say that P1 and P2 are independent if u1 = v1, un = vn, and ui ≠ vi for 1 < i < n. We 
say a set of hamiltonian paths {P1, P2, …, Ps} of G between two distinct vertices are 
mutually independent if any two distinct paths in the set are independent. There are 
some study on mutually independent Hamiltonian paths [40, 41]. 
Recently, people are interested in a mathematical puzzle, called Sudoku [42]. 
Sudoku can be viewed as a 9×9 Latin square with some constraints. There are several 
variations of Sudoku have been introduced. Mutually independent Hamiltonian cycles 
can also be considered as a variation of Sudoku. 
On the other hand, we prove that the hypercube Qn is bipanpositionable 
bipancyclic for n ≥ 2. As a consequence of this result, we can see that many previous 
results on hypercubes follow directly from ours. For example, the family of the 
hypercube is bipancyclic, bipanconnected, bipanpositionable, edge-bipancyclic and 
vertex-bipancyclic. Therefore, our result unifies these results in a general sense.

2. Definitions
For definitions and notations not defined here see [6]. Let V be a finite set and E a subset of {(u, v) |
(u, v) is an unordered pair of V }. Then G = (V , E) is a graph with vertex set V and edge set E. The order of G, that is, the
cardinality of the set V , is denoted by n(G). For a subset S of V the graph G[S] induced by S is a graph with vertex set
V (G[S]) = S and edge set E(G[S]) = {(x, y) | (x, y) ∈ E(G) and x, y ∈ S}. Two vertices u and v are adjacent if (u, v) is an edge
of G. For a vertex u the set NG(u) = {v | (u, v) ∈ E} is called the set of neighbors of u. The degree degG(u) of a vertex u in G, is
the cardinality of the setNG(u). Theminimum degree of G, δ(G), is min{degG(x) | x ∈ V }. A graph G is k-regular if degG(u) = k
for every vertex u in G. The connectivity of G is the minimum number of vertices whose removal leaves the remaining graph
disconnected or trivial. A path between vertices v0 and vk is a sequence of vertices represented by 〈v0, v1, . . . , vk〉 such that
there is no repeated vertex and (vi, vi+1) is an edge of G for every i ∈ {0 . . . k− 1}. We use Q (i) to denote the ith vertex vi of
Q = 〈v1, v2, . . . , vk〉. We also write the path 〈v0, v1, . . . , vk〉 as 〈v0, . . . , vi,Q , vj, . . . , vk〉, where Q is a path form vi to vj. A
path is a hamiltonian path if it contains all vertices of G. A graph G is hamiltonian connected if there exists a hamiltonian path
joining any two distinct vertices of G. A cycle is a sequence of vertices represented by 〈v0, v1, . . . , vk, v0〉 such that vi 6= vj
for all i 6= j, (v0, vk) is an edge of G, and (vi, vi+1) is an edge of G for every i ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1}. A hamiltonian cycle of G is a
cycle that traverses every vertex of G. A graph is hamiltonian if it has a hamiltonian cycle.
A hamiltonian cycle C of graph G is described as 〈u1, u2, . . . , un(G), u1〉 to emphasize the order of vertices in C . Thus,
u1 is the starting vertex and ui is the ith vertex in C . Two hamiltonian cycles C1 = 〈u1, u2, . . . , un(G), u1〉 and C2 =
〈v1, v2, . . . , vn(G), v1〉 of G are independent if u1 = v1 and ui 6= vi for every i ∈ {2, . . . , n(G)}. A set of hamiltonian
cycles {C1, C2, . . . , Ck} of G are mutually independent if its elements are pairwise independent. The mutually independent
hamiltonicity IHC(G) of graph G the maximum integer k such that for any vertex u of G there exist kmutually independent
hamiltonian cycles of G starting at u. Obviously, IHC(G) ≤ δ(G) if G is a hamiltonian graph.
The mutually independent hamiltonicity of a graph can be interpreted as a Latin rectangle. A Latin square of order n is an
n×n arraymade from the integers 1 to nwith the property that any integer occurs once in each row and column. If we delete
some rows from a Latin square, we will get a Latin rectangle. Let K5 be the complete graph with vertex set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and
let C1 = 〈0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0〉, C2 = 〈0, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0〉, C3 = 〈0, 3, 4, 1, 2, 0〉, and C4 = 〈0, 4, 1, 2, 3, 0〉. Obviously, C1, C2, C3, and
C4 are mutually independent. Thus, IHC(K5) = 4. We rewrite C1, C2, C3, and C4 into the following Latin square:
1 2 3 4
2 3 4 1
3 4 1 2
4 1 2 3
In general, a Latin square of order n can be viewed as n mutually independent hamiltonian cycles with respect to the
complete graph Kn+1.
LetH be a group and let S be the generating set ofH such that S−1 = S. Then the Cayley graph Cayley(S;H) of the groupH
with respect to the generating set S is the graph with vertex set H and two vertex u and v are adjacent in Cayley(S;H)
if and only if u−1v ∈ S. Hamiltonian cycles in Cayley graphs naturally arise in computer science [25], in the study of
word-hyperbolic groups and automatic groups [14], in changing-ringing [40], in creating Escher-like repeating patterns
in hyperbolic plane [13], and in combinatorial designs [11].
3. Applications of the concept of mutually independent hamiltonian cycles
Mutually independent hamiltonicity of graphs can be applied to many areas. Consider the following scenario. In
Christmas, we have a holiday of 10-days. A tour agency will organize a 10-day tour to Italy. Suppose that there will be a
lot of people joining this tour. However, the maximum number of people stay in each local area is limited, say 100 people,
for the sake of hotel contract. One trivial solution is on the First-Come-First-Serve basis. So only 100 people can attend
this tour. (Note that we cannot schedule the tour in a pipelined manner because the holiday period is fixed.) Nonetheless,
we observe that a tour is like a hamiltonian cycle based on a graph, in which a vertex is denoted as a hotel and any two
vertices are joinedwith an edge if the associated two hotels can be traveled in a reasonable time. Therefore, we can organize
several subgroups, that is, each subgroup has its own tour. In this way, we do not allow two subgroups stay in the same area
during the same time period. In other words, any two different tours are indeed independent hamiltonian cycles. Suppose
that there are 10 mutually independent hamiltonian cycles. Then we may allow 1000 people to visit Italy on Christmas
vacation. For this reason, we would like to find the maximum number of mutually independent hamiltonian cycles. Such
applications are useful for task scheduling and resource placement, which are also important for compiler optimization to
exploit parallelism.
An interconnection network connects the processors of parallel computers. Its architecture can be represented as a graph
inwhich the vertices correspond to processors and the edges correspond to connections. Hence,we use graphs and networks
interchangeably. There are many mutually conflicting requirements in designing the topology for computer networks. The
n-cube is one of the most popular topologies [27]. The n-dimensional star network Sn was proposed in [1] as n attractive
alternative to the n-cube topology for interconnecting processors in parallel computers. Since its introduction, the network

With Theorem 1, we can find the required hamiltonian path in Pn for every n, n ≥ 5. 
Lemma 4. Let a and b be any two distinct elements in 〈n〉 with n ≥ 4, and let x be a vertex of Pn. There is a hamiltonian path P
of Pn − {x} joining a vertex u with (u)1 = a to a vertex v with (v)1 = b.
Proof. Suppose that n = 4. Since P4 is vertex transitive, we may assume that x = 1234. Without loss of generality, we may
assume that a < b. The required paths of P4 − {1234} are listed below:

With Theorem 1, we can find the required hamiltonian path on Pn for every n, n ≥ 5. 
Lemma 5. Let a and b be any two distinct elements in 〈n〉with n ≥ 4. Assume that x and y are two adjacent vertices of Pn. There
is a hamiltonian path P of Pn − {x, y} joining a vertex u with (u)1 = a to a vertex v with (v)1 = b.
Proof. Since Pn is vertex transitive, we may assume that x = e and y = (e)i for some i ∈ {2, 3, . . . , n}. Without loss of
generality, we assume that a < b. Thus, a 6= n and b 6= 1.We prove this statement by induction on n. For n = 4, the required

Suppose that this statement holds for Pk for every k, 4 ≤ k < n. We have the following cases:
Case 1. j 6= n, that is, x1 ∈ P {n}n and x2 ∈ P {n}n . Let c ∈ 〈n − 1〉 − {1, a}. By induction, there is a hamiltonian path R of
P {n}n − {e, x1, x2} joining a vertex u with (u)1 = a to a vertex z with (z)1 = c. We choose a vertex v in P {1}n with (v)1 = b.
By Theorem 2, there is a hamiltonian path H of P 〈n−1〉n joining the vertex (z)n to v. We set P = 〈u, R, z, (z)n,H, v〉. Then P is
the desired path.
Case 2. j = n, that is, x1 ∈ P {n}n and x2 ∈ P {1}n . Let c ∈ 〈n − 1〉 − {1, a} and d ∈ 〈n − 1〉 − {1, b, c}. By Lemma 5, there is
a hamiltonian path R of P {n}n − {e, x1} joining a vertex u with (u)1 = a to a vertex z with (z)1 = c . By Lemma 4, there is a
hamiltonian path H of P {1}n − {x2} joining a vertex w with (w)1 = d to a vertex v with (v)1 = b. By Theorem 2, there is a
hamiltonian Q of P 〈n−1〉−{1}n joining the vertex (z)n to the vertex (w)n. We set P = 〈u, R, z, (z)n,Q , (w)n,w,H, v〉. Then P is
the desired path. 
Our main result for the pancake graph Pn is stated in the following theorem.
Theorem 3. IHC(P3) = 1 and IHC(Pn) = n− 1 if n ≥ 4.
Proof. It is easy to see that P3 is isomorphic to a cycle with six vertices. Thus, IHC(P3) = 1. Since Pn is (n − 1)-regular
graph, it is clear that IHC(Pn) ≤ n− 1. Since Pn is vertex transitive, we only need to show that there exist (n− 1)mutually
independent hamiltonian cycles of Pn starting form the vertex e. For n = 4, we prove that IHC(P4) ≥ 3 by listing the required
hamiltonian cycles as follows:

the vertex (e)n−1. By Theorem 2, there is a hamiltonian path H2 of ∪n−1t=1 P {b1,t }n joining the vertex (e)n to the vertex (x)n with
H2(i+(j−1)(n−1)!) ∈ P {b1,j}n for every i ∈ 〈(n−1)!〉 and for every j ∈ 〈n−1〉.We set C1 = 〈e, (e)n,H2, (x)n, x,H1, (e)n−1, e〉.

between S{i}n and S
{j}
n . By the definition of Sn, there is exactly one neighbor v of u such that u and v are adjacent through an
i-dimensional edge with 2 ≤ i ≤ n. For this reason, we use (u)i to denote the unique i-neighbor of u. We have ((u)i)i = u
and (u)n ∈ S{(u)1}n .
Lemma 7. Let i and j be any two distinct elements in 〈n〉 with n ≥ 3. Then |E i,jn | = (n − 2)!. Moreover, there are (n − 2)!/2

Lemma 8. Let u and v be two distinct vertices of Sn with d(u, v) ≤ 2. Then (u)1 6= (v)1.
Theorem 4 ([21]). Let n ≥ 4. Suppose that u is a white vertex of Sn and v is a black vertex of Sn. Then there is a hamiltonian
path of Sn joining u to v.
Theorem 5. Let {a1, a2, . . . , ar} be a subset of 〈n〉 for some r ∈ 〈n〉 with n ≥ 5. Assume that u is a white vertex in S{a1}n and v
is a black vertex in S{ar }n . Then there is a hamiltonian path 〈u = x1,H1, y1, x2,H2, y2, . . . , xr,Hr , yr = v〉 of ∪ri=1 S{ai}n joining u
to v such that x1 = u, yr = v, and Hi is a hamiltonian path of S{ai}n joining xi to yi for every i, 1 ≤ i ≤ r.
Proof. We set x1 as u and yr as v. By Theorem 4, this theorem holds on r = 1. Suppose that r ≥ 2. By Lemma 7, there are
(n− 2)!/2 ≥ 3 edges joining black vertices of S{ai}n to white vertices of S{ai+1}n for every i ∈ 〈r − 1〉. We can choose an edge
(yi, xi+1) ∈ Eai,ai+1n with yi being a black vertex and xi+1 being a white vertex for every i ∈ 〈r − 1〉. By Theorem 4, there is a
hamiltonian path Hi of S
{ai}
n joining xi to yi for every i ∈ 〈r〉. Then the path 〈u = x1,H1, y1, x2,H2, y2, . . . , xr,Hr , yr = v〉 is
the desired path. 
Theorem 6 ([21]). Let w be a black vertex of Sn with n ≥ 4. Assume that u and v are two distinct white vertices of Sn − {w }.
Then there is a hamiltonian path H of Sn − {w} joining u to v.
Lemma 9 ([30]). Let i be any element in 〈n〉 with n ≥ 4. Assume that r and s are two adjacent vertices of Sn and u is a white
vertex of Sn − {r, s}. Then there is a hamiltonian path of Sn − {r, s} joining u to some black vertex v with (v)1 = i.
Lemma 10. Let a and b be any two distinct elements in 〈n〉 with n ≥ 4. Assume that x is a white vertex of Sn, and assume that
x1 and x2 are two distinct neighbors of x. Then there is a hamiltonian path P of Sn − {x, x1, x2} joining a white vertex u with
(u)1 = a to a white vertex v with (v)1 = b.
Proof. Since Sn is vertex transitive and edge transitive, we may assume that x = e, x1 = (e)2, and x2 = (e)3. Without loss
of generality, we may also assume that a < b. We have a 6= n and b 6= 1. We prove this statement by induction on n. For

hamiltonian graph. We can define MOMH(G) as the largest integer k such that there exist k sets of mutually independent
hamiltonian cycle of G beginning from any vertex x such that each set contains exactly IHC(G) hamiltonian cycles and any
two different sets are orthogonal. It would be interesting to study the value ofMOMH(G) for some hamiltonian graphs G.
We can also discuss mutually independent hamiltonian paths for some graphs. Let P1 = 〈v1, v2, . . . , vn〉 and P2 =
〈u1, u2, . . . , un〉 be two hamiltonian paths of a graph G. We say that P1 and P2 are independent if u1 = v1, un = vn, and
ui 6= vi for 1 < i < n. We say a set of hamiltonian paths {P1, P2, . . . , Ps} of G between two distinct vertices are mutually
independent if any twodistinct paths in the set are independent. There are some study onmutually independent hamiltonian
paths [29,39].
Recently, people are interested in amathematical puzzle, called Sudoku [38]. Sudoku can be viewed as a 9×9 Latin square
with some constraints. There are several variations of Sudoku have been introduced. Mutually independent hamiltonian
cycles can also be considered as a variation of Sudoku.

by Mitchem and Schmeichel [4]. A bipartite graph is bipancyclic if it contains a cycle of every even length from 4 to
|V (G)| inclusive. It is proved that the hypercube Qn is bipancyclic if n ≥ 2 [5,6]. A graph is panconnected if, for any two
different vertices x and y, there exists a path of length l joining x and y for every l with dG(x, y) ≤ l ≤ |V (G)| − 1. The
concept of panconnected graphs was proposed by Alavi and Williamson [7]. It is easy to see that any bipartite graph with
at least 3 vertices is not panconnected. Therefore, the concept of bipanconnected graphs is proposed. A bipartite graph
is bipanconnected if, for any two different vertices x and y, there exists a path of length l joining x and y for every l with
dG(x, y) ≤ l ≤ |V (G)|−1 and (l−dG(x, y)) being even. It is proved that the hypercube is bipanconnected [5]. A hamiltonian
graph G is panpositionable if for any two different vertices x and y of G and for any integer k with dG(x, y) ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|/2,
there exists a hamiltonian cycle C of G such that dC (x, y) = k. A hamiltonian bipartite graph G is bipanpositionable if for
any two different vertices x and y of G and for any integer k with dG(x, y) ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|/2 and (k − dG(x, y)) being even,
there exists a hamiltonian cycle C of G such that dC (x, y) = k. The concepts of panpositionable and bipanpositionable were
proposed by Kao et al. [8]. They proved that the hypercube Qn is bipanpositionable if n ≥ 2 [8]. A bipartite graph G is
edge-bipancyclic if for any edge in G, there is a cycle of every even length from 4 to |V (G)| traversing through this edge. The
concept of edge-bipancyclic was proposed by Alspach and Hare [9]. A bipartite graph G is vertex-bipancyclic if for any vertex
in G, there is a cycle of every even length from 4 to |V (G)| going through this vertex. The concept of vertex-bipancyclic was
proposed by Hobbs [10]. Obviously, every edge-bipancyclic graph is vertex-bipancyclic. It is proved that the hypercube Qn
is edge-bipancyclic if n ≥ 2 [5].
In this paper, we propose a more interesting property about hypercubes. A k-cycle is a cycle of length k. A bipartite graph
G is k-cycle bipanpositionable if for every different vertices x and y of G and for any integer l with dG(x, y) ≤ l ≤ k2 and
(l − dG(x, y)) being even, there exists a k-cycle C of G such that dC (x, y) = l. (Note that dC (x, y) ≤ k2 for every cycle C of
length k.) A bipartite graph G is bipanpositionable bipancyclic if G is k-cycle bipanpositionable for every even integer k with
4 ≤ k ≤ |V (G)|. In this paper, we prove that the hypercube Qn is bipanpositionable bipancyclic for n ≥ 2. As a consequence
of this result, we can see thatmany previous results on hypercubes follows directly from ours. For example, the hypercube is
bipancyclic, bipanconnected, bipanpositionable, edge-bipancyclic and vertex-bipancyclic. Therefore, our result unifies these
results in a general sense.
2. The bipanpositionable bipancyclic property
We prove our main result by induction as stated in Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 below.
Lemma 1. The hypercube Q3 is bipanpositionable bipancyclic.
Proof. Let x and y be two different vertices in Q3. Obviously, dQ3(x, y) = 1, 2 or 3. Since the hypercube is vertex symmetric,
without loss of generality, we may assume that x = 000.
Case 1: Suppose that dQ3(x, y) = 1. Since Q3 is edge symmetric, we assume that y = 001.
y = 001 4-cycle dC (x, y) = 1 〈000, 001, 011, 010, 000〉
6-cycle dC (x, y) = 1 〈000, 001, 101, 111, 110, 100, 000〉
dC (x, y) = 3 〈000, 100, 101, 001, 011, 010, 000〉
8-cycle dC (x, y) = 1 〈000, 001, 101, 111, 011, 010, 110, 100, 000〉
dC (x, y) = 3 〈000, 100, 101, 001, 011, 111, 110, 010, 000〉
Case 2: Suppose that dQ3(x, y) = 2. By symmetry, we assume that y = 011.
y = 011 4-cycle dC (x, y) = 2 〈000, 001, 011, 010, 000〉
6-cycle dC (x, y) = 2 〈000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 100, 000〉
8-cycle dC (x, y) = 2 〈000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100, 000〉
dC (x, y) = 4 〈000, 001, 101, 111, 011, 010, 110, 100, 000〉
Case 3: Suppose that dQ3(x, y) = 3. We have y = 111.
y = 111 6-cycle dC (x, y) = 3 〈000, 001, 011, 111, 110, 100, 000〉
8-cycle dC (x, y) = 3 〈000, 001, 011, 111, 101, 100, 110, 010, 000〉
Thus, Q3 is bipanpositionable bipancyclic. 
Theorem 1. The hypercube Qn is bipanpositionable bipancyclic for n ≥ 2.

A path in G is a hamiltonian path if it contains all vertices of G . A graph G is hamiltonian
connected if there exists a hamiltonian path between any two distinct vertices of G . The
degree of a vertex u in G is the number of vertices of G adjacent to u. We denote by
δ(G) the minimum degree of vertices of G . A graph G is conditional k edge-fault tolerant
hamiltonian connected if G − F is hamiltonian connected for every F ⊂ E(G) with |F | k
and δ(G − F )  3. The conditional edge-fault tolerant hamiltonian connectivity HC3e (G)
is deﬁned as the maximum integer k such that G is k edge-fault tolerant conditional
hamiltonian connected if G is hamiltonian connected and is undeﬁned otherwise. Let n 4.
We use Kn to denote the complete graph with n vertices. In this paper, we show that
HC3e (Kn) = 2n − 10 for n /∈ {4,5,8,10}, HC3e (K4) = 0, HC3e (K5) = 2, HC3e (K8) = 5, and

1. Introduction
For the graph deﬁnitions and notations, we follow [1].
Let G = (V , E) be a graph if V is a ﬁnite set and E is a sub-
set of {(u, v) | (u, v) is an unordered pair of V }. We say
that V is the vertex set and E is the edge set. Two vertices
u and v are adjacent if (u, v) ∈ E . The complete graph Kn
is the graph with n vertices such that any two distinct
vertices are adjacent. The degree of a vertex u in G , de-
noted by degG(u), is the number of vertices adjacent to u.
We use δ(G) to denote min{degG(u) | u ∈ V (G)}. A path of
length m − 1, 〈v0, v1, . . . , vm−1〉, is an ordered list of dis-
tinct vertices such that vi and vi+1 are adjacent for 0 i 
m − 2. We also write the path 〈v0, . . . , vk, P , vl, . . . , vm〉
for P = 〈vk, . . . , vl〉. A cycle is a path with at least three
vertices such that the ﬁrst vertex is the same as the last
one. A hamiltonian cycle of G is a cycle that traverses every
vertex of G exactly once. A graph is hamiltonian if it has
a hamiltonian cycle. A hamiltonian path is a path of length
V (G) − 1.

A hamiltonian graph G is k edge-fault tolerant hamilto-
nian if G − F remains hamiltonian for every F ⊂ E(G) with
|F |  k. The edge-fault tolerant hamiltonicity, He(G), is de-
ﬁned as the maximum integer k such that G is k edge-fault
tolerant hamiltonian if G is hamiltonian and is undeﬁned
otherwise. Assume that G is a hamiltonian graph, and x
is a vertex such that degG(x) = δ(G). We arbitrary choose
degG(x) − 1 edges from those edges incident to x to form
an edge faulty set F . Obviously, degG−F (x) = 1; hence,
G − F is not hamiltonian. Therefore, He(G)  δ(G) − 2 if
He(G) is deﬁned. Assume that n is an integer with n  3.
It is proved by Ore [9] that any n-vertex graph with at least
C(n,2) − (n − 3) edges is hamiltonian. Moreover, there ex-
ists a non-hamiltonian n-vertex graph with C(n,2)−(n−2)
edges. In other words, He(Kn) = n − 3 for n  3. In [5],
it is proved that He(Qn) = n − 2 for n  2 where Qn
is the n-dimensional hypercube. In [6], it is proved that
He(Sn) = n − 3 for n  3 where Sn is the n-dimensional
star graph.
Chan and Lee [2] began the study of the existence of
hamiltonian cycle in a graph such that each vertex is inci-
dent to at least two fault-free edges. A graph G is condi-
tional k edge-fault tolerant hamiltonian if G − F is hamilto-

d11. Obviously,
∑11
i=1 di = 24. Assume that the lemma
is false. Then degK11(F )(xi) ∈ {0,1,5,6,7} for 1  i 
11. By brute force, all such sequences are listed below:
(7,7,7,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0), (7,7,6,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0), (7,
7,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), (7,7,5,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0), (7,6,
6,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), (7,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0), (7,6,5,
5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0), (7,6,5,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0), (7,5,5,5,
1,1,0,0,0,0,0), (6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0), (6,6,6,5,1,
0,0,0,0,0,0), (6,6,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0), (6,6,5,5,1,1,
0,0,0,0,0), (6,5,5,5,1,1,1,0,0,0,0), and (5,5,5,5,1,1,
1,1,0,0,0). By Theorem 2, we can check that such a graph
does not exist. The lemma is proved. 
We can easily obtain the following lemma.
Lemma 4. Let k  2. Let G be a hamiltonian connected graph.
Then deleting any set S of k vertices from G, the resulting graph
G − S contains at most k − 1 connected components.
By the above lemma, we have a simple observation.
Lemma 5. Let k 2. Let G be a graph. If there is a set S of k ver-
tices such that G− S contains k or more connected components,
then G is not hamiltonian connected.
3. Main result
Lemma 6. Let n  4 and F ⊂ E(Kn) with δ(Kn − F )  3.
Then Kn − F is hamiltonian connected if |F |  2n − 10 for
n /∈ {4,5,8,10}, |F | = 0 for n = 4, |F |  2 for n = 5, and
|F | 2n − 11 for n ∈ {8,10}.
Proof. We prove this lemma by induction on n. Yet, we
should be very careful because the size of |F | is depending
on n. Without loss of generality, we assume that |F | = 2n−
10 for n /∈ {4,5,8,10}, |F | = 0 for n = 4, |F | = 2 for n =
5, and |F | = 2n − 11 for n ∈ {8,10}. The induction bases
are n = 4, n = 5, and n = 6. Suppose n = 4 and |F | = 0. It
is easy to see that the complete graph K4 is hamiltonian
connected. Suppose n = 5 and |F | = 2. To keep δ(K5− F )
3, F forms two independent edges. By brute force, it is
easy to check whether K5 − F is hamiltonian connected.
Suppose that n = 6 and |F | = 2. Obviously, F is either two
adjacent edges or two independent edges. Again, by brute
force, we can check that K6 − F is hamiltonian connected.
Now, we assume that n  7. Let u and v be any two
vertices of Kn . The lemma follows if we can ﬁnd a hamil-
tonian path of Kn − F between u and v .
Case 1. degKn(F )(u) 	= 0 or degKn(F )(v) 	= 0. Without loss
of generality, we assume that degKn(F )(u) = k 	= 0. Let
i1, . . . , ik be the vertices such that (u, i j) ∈ F for 1 j  k.
Let F ′ = (F −{(u, i1), . . . , (u, ik)})∪{(v, i1), . . . , (v, ik)}. Ob-
viously, |F ′| |F |. Now, we consider Kn−{u} as a complete
graph of (n−1) vertices with faulty edge set F ′ . Obviously,
|F ′|  2(n − 1) − 8 for n /∈ {8,10} and |F ′|  2(n − 1) − 9
for n ∈ {8,10}. Moreover, δ(Kn − {u} − F ′)  2. Thus, we
can apply Theorem 1 to obtain a hamiltonian cycle C in
Kn − {u} − F ′ . Without loss of generality, we write C as
〈v, x, . . . , y, v〉. Then, 〈u, x, . . . , y, v〉 forms a hamiltonian
path of Kn − F joining u to v .
Case 2. degKn(F )(u) = 0 and degKn(F )(v) = 0. By Lem-
mas 1, 2, and 3, there exists a vertex w such that
2  degKn(F )(w)  n−12  − 1 for n ∈ {9,11} and 1 
degKn(F )(w) n−12  − 1 for n /∈ {9,11}.
Obviously, δ(Kn − F − {w})  2. Suppose that δ(Kn −
F − {w}) = 2. Let x be any vertex in Kn − {w} such that
degKn−{w}−F (x) = 2. Obviously, (x,w) /∈ F , degKn−F (x) = 3,
and degKn(F )(x) = n− 4. We claim that x is the only vertex
in Kn − {w} with degKn−{w}−F (x) = 2. If otherwise, let z
be another vertex in Kn − {w} with degKn−{w}−F (z) = 2.
Then |F |  degKn(F )(x) + degKn(F )(z) − 1 = 2n − 9. This is
impossible because |F | 2n−10. Thus, x is the only vertex
in Kn−{w} such that degKn−{w}−F (x) = 2. Thus, δ(Kn− F −{u, x}) 3.
Let F ′ = F − {(x, i) | i ∈ V (Kn)}. We consider Kn − {u, x}
as a complete graph of (n−2) vertices with faulty edge set
F ′ . Obviously, |F ′| = 1  2 for n = 7, |F ′| = n − 7  2(n −
2)− 10 for n /∈ {10,12}, and |F ′| = n− 7 2(n− 2)− 11 for
n ∈ {10,12}. By induction, we have a hamiltonian path P
of Kn − {u, x} − F ′ joining w to v . So 〈u, x,w, P , v〉 forms
a hamiltonian path of Kn − F joining u to v .
Now, we consider δ(Kn − {w} − F )  3. Since 2 
degKn(F )(w)  n−12  − 1 for n ∈ {9,11} and 1 
degKn(F )(w)  n−12  − 1 for n /∈ {9,11}, there exists
(x, y) ∈ F such that {(w, x), (w, y)} ∩ F = ∅. We set F ′ as
F − {(w, z) | (w, z) ∈ F } − {(x, y)} and consider Kn − {w}
with faulty set F ′ . We have |F ′| = 2n− 10− degKn(F )(w) −
1 2n−13 for n ∈ {9,11} and |F ′| = 2n−10−degKn(F )(w)−
1  2n − 12 for n /∈ {9,11}. By induction, there exists a
hamiltonian path P = 〈u = x1, x2, . . . , xn−1 = v〉 of Kn −
{w} − F ′ joining u to v . Suppose that (x, y) ∈ P . There
exists an integer i such that {xi, xi+1} = {x, y} for some i.
Suppose that (x, y) /∈ P . Since degKn(F )(w) n−12 −1 and
degKn(F )(w) + degKn−F (w) = n− 1, degKn−F (w)  n2 + 1.
Hence, there exists an integer i such that (xi, xi+1) ∈ P and
{(w, xi), (w, xi+1)}∩ F = ∅. Therefore, 〈u = x1, x2, . . . , xi,w,
xi+1, xi+2, . . . , v〉 forms a hamiltonian path of Kn − F join-
ing u to v . 
Theorem 3. Let n  4. Then HC3e (Kn) = 2n − 10 for n /∈
{4,5,8,10}, HC3e (K4) = 0, HC3e (K5) = 2, HC3e (K8) = 5, and
HC3e (K10) = 9.
Proof. Let F be any subset of E(Kn) with δ(Kn − F )  3.
Since δ(Kn− F ) 3, |F | = 0 for n = 4 and |F | 2 for n = 5.
Thus, HC3e (K4) = 0 and HC3e (K5) = 2.
Suppose n = 8. Let V (K8) = {x1, x2, . . . , x8}. We set R =
{x1, . . . , x4}, S = {x5, . . . , x8}, and F = {(u, v) | u, v ∈ R}. We
can check that δ(K8 − F ) 3, |F | = 6 and (K8 − F )− S has
four connected components. By Lemma 5, K8 − F is not
hamiltonian connected. See Fig. 1(a) for illustration. Thus,
HC3e (K8) < 6. By Lemma 6, HC3e (K8) = 5.
Suppose n = 10. Let V (K10) = {x1, x2, . . . , x10}. We set
R = {x1, . . . , x5}, S = {x6, . . . , x10}, and F = {(u, v) | u, v ∈
