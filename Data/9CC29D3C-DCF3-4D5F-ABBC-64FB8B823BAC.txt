下面將分節簡述本年之研究成
果。 
 
三、風致極限狀態 
風致極限狀態可概分為三類，包
括主結構與隔間之損壞、外部被覆物
之損壞及高層居住者之不舒適性，分
述如下： 
 
3.1 主結構與隔間之損壞 
主結構與隔間之損壞依其損壞程
度可概分為崩塌、嚴重損壞、中度損
壞及輕微損壞等層級；各層級各有對
應之層間變位角上限值與下限值。由
順風向風力、橫風向風力與扭轉向風
力所造成之層間變位角若介於某一
損壞層級對應之層間變位角上限值
與下限值之間，則主結構與隔間之損
壞屬於此一層級。 
 
3.2 外部被覆物之損壞 
外部被覆物之損壞可能由於局部
風壓過大或風致飄散物撞擊動量過
大所致。當同時考慮外風壓與內風壓
之最大總風壓超過某一被覆物之耐
風壓強度時，此被覆物產生破壞。而
當鄰近區域產生風致飄散物且撞擊
至某一被覆物時，若最大撞擊動量超
越被覆物之耐動量強度時，此被覆物
也會產生破壞。根據各外部被覆物之
破壞與否，可決定被覆物之整體損壞
比例。 
 
3.3 高層居住者之不舒適性 
高層居住者之不舒適性依其不舒
適程度可概分為無法容忍、嚴重惱
人、中度惱人及輕度惱人等層級；
各層級各有對應之頂層加速度上限
值與下限值。由順風向風力、橫風
向風力與扭轉向風力所造成之頂層
加速度若介於某一不舒適度層級對
應之頂層加速度上限值與下限值之
間，則高層居住者之不舒適度屬於
此一層級。 
 
四、風速之不確定性 
前述三類風致極限狀態中所牽涉
之物理量，無論是風速、風力、結構
性質或各層級門檻值均具有不確定
性，故無法完全確定各風致極限狀態
是否被超越。欲評估各風致極限狀態
被超越之機率，需先估計各不確定性
之機率分佈，其中風速是影響最大
者。 
 
風速在時間與空間上具有高度隨
機性，其不確定性對耐風可靠度有決
定性之影響。本研究分別模擬產生平
常時期每日最大風速與颱風時期逐
時風速，再據以估計風速之機率分
佈。 
 
4.1 平常時期每日最大風速 
針對無劇烈氣候變化的測站風
速，分別採用高斯過程迴歸模型與隱
藏式馬可夫鏈法進行分析。 
 
4.1.1 高斯過程迴歸模型 
以高斯過程迴歸模型來考量風速
的不確定性，並由貝氏分析與漸變型
馬可夫鍊蒙地卡羅法找出合適的高
斯過程模型參數。

Carlo Simulation；MCS)法可準確求
解小型結構可靠度問題，但當分析
真實結構、考慮動態反應或破壞機
率很小的情況下，性能函數 
(performance function)可能牽涉複雜
之動態有限元素運算，讓MCS 變得
非常耗時而不切實際。欲以較少樣本
數模擬而能夠達到相同的精度，必需
使用變異數消減的技巧，其中重點取
樣法是最具代表性的方法之一。本計
劃提出改良式適應核心重點取樣
法。其概念是根據基本隨機變數之聯
合機率密度函數，使用馬可夫鏈取出
落於失敗區域一系列的點，決定中心
密度取樣函數，再以此函數進行少量
取樣，推估失敗機率。其次，在快速
積分法之架構下，將時變(動態)可靠
度問題轉換成時不變可靠度問題
後，其中轉換後之性能函數與條件失
敗機率有關，而條件失敗機率必須用
隨機振動分析或反應曲面法在取樣
中心點估計。 
 
考慮一高寬比為5之方形斷面結
構物，簡化模擬為三個自由度之系
統；此結構系統承受10分鐘穩態
(stationary)、非常態(non-Gaussian)之
橫風向風力作用。假設升力係數與縱
向渦流帶寬函數均不隨高度改變；結
構物底層之勁度與頂層之阻尼均呈
對數常態分佈，且彼此為統計上獨
立。當結構物在10分鐘內，任一時刻
之層間位移(涵蓋穩態與非穩態部分)
超越給定之門檻值即視為失敗。 
 
本研究模擬產生符合橫風向風力
自頻譜密度函數、前四次統計矩及同
調性函數之各自由度風力歷時，以供
耐風歷時分析之用。其中先以交頻譜
密度函數矩陣，模擬產生呈常態分佈
之隨機歷時；接著利用頻譜修正法，
將個別歷時轉換為非常態歷時；再經
重複疊代，使其同調性函數之偏移誤
差與變異誤差符合要求。 
 
研究中以落於失敗區樣本的標準
偏差決定階段長度，以增加取樣之效
率。當作反應曲面分析時，若取較小
之尺寸因子，取樣樣本落於反應曲面
外之比例會較高，動力分析之次數會
增加，所花費的運算時間較長，但破
壞機率之收斂速率較快。分析結果顯
示所提方法估計失敗機率的效率遠
比傳統MCS來得高。

ABSTRACT: Determination of design wind speeds and the associated uncertainty is the most essential step in 
wind-resistant structural designs and in quantatative wind risk assessments.  Design wind speeds are usually 
obtained by analyzing the recorded field wind speeds using various statistical methods.  However, recorded 
field wind data are often quite limited and are not sufficient for reliable statistical analyses, especially when 
one is predicting long-return-period design wind speeds or directional design wind speeds.  Accordingly, the 
generation of artificial wind speeds whose statistical properties are compatible to those from observed wind 
speeds is a critical research topic. 
This paper proposes a non-stationary auto-regressive model with a hidden Markov chain to analyze field wind 
speeds and then to simulate synthetic wind speed time series. Compared to the models adopted by previous re-
searches, the chosen model is different in the way that it is a non-stationary model.  Moreover, new algo-
rithms are developed to generate synthetic wind speeds based on the model and field wind speeds.  
The daily wind speeds at a weather station are collected to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed 
approach.  The long-term trend is first modeled and filtered out of the collected data.  The empirical cumu-
lative distribution function derived from the filtered data is modified by a generalized Pareto distribution; the 
resulting compound distribution function is used for transforming the filtered data into 'standard' data with a 
Gaussian distribution.  Next, a non-stationary auto-regresive model with random coefficients modeled by a 
hidden Markov chain is developed for analyzing the 'standard' data.  The maximum-likelihood estimates for 
the variances of daily winds are computed by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm; the random 
coefficients are sampled based on a Kalman filter algorithm.  It is shown in the current study that the statisti-
cal properties (e.g., means, standard deviations, auto-correlation functions as well as exceedance probabilities) 
of the simulated wind speeds are quite close to those of the field wind speeds.   In addition, the simulated 
wind speeds exhibit the similar non-stationarity inherent in the field wind speeds; it reveals that the proposed 
model is capable of simulating non-stationary wind speeds. 
. 
 
 
3.2 Estimation of model parameters 
The maximum-likelihood estimates ML365:12σˆ for the 
variances 2kσ (k=1,…365) can be derived by an Ex-
pectation-Maximization algorithm (Shumway and 
Stoffer, 1982).  A set of realization for ke (k=1,…, 
365), 365:1eˆ , is then sampled from zero-mean Gaus-
sian distributions with variances of ML365:12σˆ .  Fur-
thermore, a set of realization for jka (j=1,…, m; 
k=1,…, 365), ma :1365:1ˆ , has been sampled based on a 
Kalman filter algorithm (Cherng, etc., 2008). 
3.3 Generation of wind speed time series 
A year of standardized daily wind speeds 365:1Z can be 
generated by substituting a set of ma :1365:1ˆ  and 365:1eˆ , 
sampled in Section 3.2, into Eq. (2).  Subsequently, 
thirty-nine years of standardized daily wind speeds 
39:1
365:1Z  are simulated independently in the similar 
manner.  Moreover, the application of inverse 
Gaussian transformations to 39:1365:1Z  leads to 
39:1
365:1W ; 
finally 39:1365:1S is obtained by adding the trend given by 
Eq. (1) to 39:1365:1W . 
4 COMPARISON OF FIELD AND 
ARTIFICIAL WIND SPEEDS  
4.1 Comparison between 39:1365:1X  and 
39:1
365:1Z  
To verify if the simulated wind speed time series 
39:1
365:1Z  reproduce the statistical properties of the 
standardized field wind speeds 39:1365:1X , one thousand 
sets of 39:1365:1Z  are generated and the 95% confidence 
intervals of their statistical properties are compared 
with corresponding statistical properties of 39:1365:1X .  It 
is found that monthly standard deviations of 
39:1
365:1X fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the 
associated standard deviations of 39:1365:1Z .  Figures 3 
and 4 show the comparison of auto-correlation func-
tions in March and September respectively; Figure 5 
shows the comparison of exceedance probability 
curves.  All three figures indicate that the statistical 
properties of 39:1365:1Z  are quite close to those of 39:1
365:1X .

4.2 Comparison between 39:1365:1V  and 
39:1
365:1W  
Subsequently, one thousand sets of 39:1365:1W  are com-
puted and the 95% confidence intervals of their sta-
tistical properties are compared with corresponding 
statistical properties of 39:1365:1V .  It is observed that 
monthly standard deviations of 39:1365:1V  locate within 
the 95% confidence intervals of the associated stan-
dard deviations of 39:1365:1W .  Figures 6 and 7 display 
the comparison of cumulative distribution functions 
and exceedance probability curves respectively.  
They also demonstrate that the statistical properties 
of 39:1365:1V  fall within the corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals for those of 39:1365:1W .

speeds and then to simulate synthetic wind speed time series. Compared to the models adopted by previous re-
searches, the chosen model is different in the way that it is a non-stationary model.  Moreover, new algo-
rithms are developed to generate synthetic wind speeds based on the model and field wind speeds.  
The daily wind speeds at a weather station are collected to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed 
approach.  The long-term trend is first modeled and filtered out of the collected data.  The empirical cumu-
lative distribution function derived from the filtered data is modified by a generalized Pareto distribution; the 
resulting compound distribution function is used for transforming the filtered data into 'standard' data with a 
Gaussian distribution.  Next, a non-stationary auto-regresive model with random coefficients modeled by a 
hidden Markov chain is developed for analyzing the 'standard' data.  The maximum-likelihood estimates for 
the variances of daily winds are computed by an Expectation-Maximization algorithm; the random 
coefficients are sampled based on a Kalman filter algorithm.  It is shown in the current study that the statisti-
cal properties (e.g., means, standard deviations, auto-correlation functions as well as exceedance probabilities) 
of the simulated wind speeds are quite close to those of the field wind speeds.   In addition, the simulated 
wind speeds exhibit the similar non-stationarity inherent in the field wind speeds; it reveals that the proposed 
model is capable of simulating non-stationary wind speeds.

3.2 Estimation of model parameters 
The maximum-likelihood estimates ML365:12σˆ for the 
variances 2kσ (k=1,…365) can be derived by an Ex-
pectation-Maximization algorithm (Shumway and 
Stoffer, 1982).  A set of realization for ke (k=1,…, 
365), 365:1eˆ , is then sampled from zero-mean Gaus-
sian distributions with variances of ML365:12σˆ .  Fur-
thermore, a set of realization for jka (j=1,…, m; 
k=1,…, 365), ma :1365:1ˆ , has been sampled based on a 
Kalman filter algorithm (Cherng, etc., 2008). 
3.3 Generation of wind speed time series 
A year of standardized daily wind speeds 365:1Z can be 
generated by substituting a set of ma :1365:1ˆ  and 365:1eˆ , 
sampled in Section 3.2, into Eq. (2).  Subsequently, 
thirty-nine years of standardized daily wind speeds 
39:1
365:1Z  are simulated independently in the similar 
manner.  Moreover, the application of inverse 
Gaussian transformations to 39:1365:1Z  leads to 
39:1
365:1W ; 
finally 39:1365:1S is obtained by adding the trend given by 
Eq. (1) to 39:1365:1W .

ARTIFICIAL WIND SPEEDS  
4.1 Comparison between 39:1365:1X  and 
39:1
365:1Z  
To verify if the simulated wind speed time series 
39:1
365:1Z  reproduce the statistical properties of the 
standardized field wind speeds 39:1365:1X , one thousand 
sets of 39:1365:1Z  are generated and the 95% confidence 
intervals of their statistical properties are compared 
with corresponding statistical properties of 39:1365:1X .  It 
is found that monthly standard deviations of 
39:1
365:1X fall within the 95% confidence intervals of the 
associated standard deviations of 39:1365:1Z .  Figures 3 
and 4 show the comparison of auto-correlation func-
tions in March and September respectively; Figure 5 
shows the comparison of exceedance probability 
curves.  All three figures indicate that the statistical 
properties of 39:1365:1Z  are quite close to those of 39:1
365:1X .

4.2 Comparison between 39:1365:1V  and 
39:1
365:1W  
Subsequently, one thousand sets of 39:1365:1W  are com-
puted and the 95% confidence intervals of their sta-
tistical properties are compared with corresponding 
statistical properties of 39:1365:1V .  It is observed that 
monthly standard deviations of 39:1365:1V  locate within 
the 95% confidence intervals of the associated stan-
dard deviations of 39:1365:1W .  Figures 6 and 7 display 
the comparison of cumulative distribution functions 
and exceedance probability curves respectively.  
They also demonstrate that the statistical properties 
of 39:1365:1V  fall within the corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals for those of 39:1365:1W .
