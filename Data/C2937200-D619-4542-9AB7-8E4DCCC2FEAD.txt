一. 中文摘要 
本研究對 0.32m 厚, 0.7m 高及 1.35m 寬
之疏鬆粉土質砂邊坡進行一系列之降雨試
驗。試驗在固定之降雨強度下進行(23、47
及 65mm/hr)。邊坡內部埋設 12 支土壤水份
計，邊坡之坡趾外側裝置漏斗型之崩塌土回
收計量系統。本試驗探討為各種類型邊坡在
降雨中破壞機制之第一步，首先探討不加勁
之邊坡在降雨破壞時內部含水量之變化，並
嘗試從內部含水量之反應曲線找出預測邊
坡大量崩塌(或土粒大量流出)之指標。實驗
結果顯示，邊坡崩塌造成土方流出，可用流
出土方量 vs.時間表示。此曲線隨降雨強度
不同而有不同之形態，但皆具有一明顯的反
曲點。此一反曲點之發生時間與邊坡在降雨
中從外部觀察之坡腳局部破壞時間相當一
致。又從內部土壤含水量 vs.時間之曲線觀
察得知在小降雨強度下，溼潤前線(Wet front)
由坡面下降至土-岩交界後飽和水位往上發
表至某一高度後發生邊坡大量崩塌；在大降
雨強度下溼潤前線本身即可能為一飽和前
線，使邊坡之破壞過程集中相當短時間內完
成，並造成非常陡峭之土粒流出曲線。本研
究並發現，邊坡土粒流出曲線之第一反曲點
與土-岩交界處含水量尖峰值之發生時間相
當接近，因此將含水量反應曲線之尖峰時間
做為邊坡大量崩塌之前兆，在邊坡破壞流出
造成災害之預警方面，具有再研究的價值。

Abstract： 
A series of rainfall tests on 0.32 m-deep, 0.7 
m–high, 1.35 m–wide sandy slopes 
incorporated with in-soil moisture content and 
solid discharge measurements was performed 
to provide a new perspective of the slope 
failure in the debris source area from a 
macro-scopic standpoint.  Focus was placed 
on the relationship between the solid 
discharge induced by the retrogressive slope 
failure in relation to the in-soil moisture 
response to the rainfall infiltration.  
Characteristics of the mass wasting process 
for the slopes were represented by mass 
wasting curves or ‘solid discharge (Qs) vs. 
time (t)’ curves which are functions of the 
rainfall intensity and / or the cumulative 
rainfall.  These mass wasting curves have 
inflection points representing transition from a 
minor toe failure into a state denoted by a 
remarkable retrogressive failure state.  It was 
also found that the inflection point for the ω 
vs. t curve measured at the soil-bedrock 
interface, Tm1(base) signaling the arrival of the 
descending ‘wet front’ may serve as a 
precursor for predicting the onset of an abrupt 
solid discharge induced by shallow slope 
failures.

instability.  A comprehensive field-scale 
monitoring program on the physical process, 
including three on-site stations, one located in 
the debris-flow initiation area, one in the 
lower channel, and one in the retention basin 
in Acquabona, Italy has been described 
in-detail by Tecca et al. (2003).  Direct 
measurements of the response of in-soil pore 
pressures in the slope subjected to rainfall 
infiltration in order to gain a better 
understanding of the mechanism of shallow 
slope failure was one of the major goals of in 
their studies.  These large-scale studies all 
reveal the importance of in-soil moisture, or 
porewater pressure response in gaining a 
better understanding of the mechanism of 
rainfall-induced slope failures.  
  Following a different approach, 
reduce-scale model slopes have also been used 
for investigating the triggering mechanism of 
slope failure.  Results of these experimental 
studies revealed that shallow slope failure 
initiation is strongly related to factors such as 
the relative position of layers with distinctive 
permeability (Lourenco et al., 2006), saturated 
soil at the toe of the slope (Nishigaki et al., 
1999, Orense et al., 2004), retrogressive 
failure nature (Lourenco et al., 2006, Orense 
et al., 2004) and the decrease in soil strength 
caused by dissipation of soil suction (Blatz et 
al., 2004).  However, follow-ups of the slope 
failures, in terms of debris discharge, were not 
reported in the above-mentioned experimental 
studies.  Reduce-scale and large-scale model 
tests have also been performed to study the 
mechanism of rainfall-induced slope 
fluidization, transferring a slope failure into a 
long run-out debris flow (e.g., Dai et al., 1999, 
Okura, Y. et al., 2002, Wang and Sassa, 2003, 
Gabet and Mudd, 2006).  In these studies, the 
soil and/or the rainfall condition triggering 
fluidization of the slope was the focus.  The 
potential of debris discharge resulting from 
the fluidization was not well-studied.   
The present study focuses on the solid 
discharge process of individual slopes 
associated with instaneous internal moisture 
changes due to rainfall infiltration, which 
excludes the long-term (or seasonal) water 
head response in the slope as observed by 
Iverson and Major (1987) in a landslide area. 
 
REDUCE-SCALE MODEL SLOPES 
SUBJECTED TO ARTIFICIAL RAINFALLS 
  Figure 1(a) shows the artificial rainfall and 
the model slope facilities used in the present 
study.  The artificial rainfall system consists 
of a water tank, an air-compressor, a 
flowmeter, plastic pipes, valves and sprinklers.  
The uniformity and intensity of rainfall were 
carefully calibrated using containers placed in 
a regular pattern.  Rainfall intensity and 
uniformity calibrations showed that for the 
range of rainfall intensity used in the present 
study, coefficients of uniformity Uc ranged 
between 85% and 91%, indicating that 
appropriate uniformity was achieved in the 
tests.   
  Figure 2 schematically shows the 
geometries of the reduce-scale model slope 
constructed using a locally available soil 
classified as SM, based on the Unified Soil 
Classification System (ASTM D 2487).  
Particle size distribution curves and the 
physical properties of the soil are shown in 
Fig. 3.  In the compaction process, a specific 
weight of moist soil was compacted using a 
specially designed light vibratory plate 
compactor to a predetermined thickness (50 
mm) indicated by the lines marked on the 
model slope container.  In this way, a loosely 
deposited stratum with a moist density of 15.7 
kN/m3 with initial water contents (ωi) of 
10%±2% were targeted.  Model slopes thus 
prepared had initial void ratios (eo) ranged 
between 0.78 and 0.84, and dry unit weights 
(γd) ranged between 14.0 and 14.5 kN/m3.  
Mean values of eo (= 0.81) and γd (= 14.2 
kN/m3) are used in the following calculations.  
The degree of saturation Sr to be presented 
later can be related to the water content (ω) 
using the following equation :

cumulative solid discharge, Qs vs. t 
relationships for three tests under various 
rainfall intensities.  The curves for relatively 
high rainfall intensities (I = 65 and 47 mm/hr) 
are characterized by steep rising, while this is 
not the case for I = 23 mm/hr.  Fig. 6 shows 
the relationships between the percentage of 
volumetric solid discharge, Pv, and cumulative 
rainfall, Rc, using the same test results as 
shown in Fig. 5(c).  Pv is defined as the ratio 
between the total volume of solid of the slope 
and the volume of discharged solid.  It can be 
seen that the slopes subjected to I = 65 and 47 
mm/hr have similar curves, while the slope for 
I = 23 mm/hr has a very different one.  This 
suggests that Rc is not a unique function of Pv 
when the rainfall intensity is less than a 
threshold value (e.g., 47 mm/hr in this case). 
It is worth mentioning that the mechanism 
controlling the rapid solid discharges seen in 
Figs. 5(c) and 6 is the so-called retrogressive 
failure (or mass wasting) in Figs. 7(a)-7(c) for 
some significant moments of slope failures.  
Figure 7(a) shows a view on the slope toe 
failure at t = 75min. which is about 5min. after 
the first inflection point on the Qt vs. t curve 
for I = 47 mm/hr.  As shown in Fig. 7(a); a 
scrap (or a cliff) can be observed at the upper 
boundary of the wash-out area.  Figs. 7(b) 
and 7(c) were taken at t = 80 min and 101 min. 
for which about 5 % and 15 %, respectively, 
of the total volume of solids was washed-out.  
Almost vertical scarps at the uppermost of the 
washed-out area can be seen, suggesting that 
the solid discharge curves presented in Fig. 
5(c) are associated with shallow slope failures, 
rather that the so-called ‘piping’ or ‘surface 
erosion’ induced by the seepage within the 
slope or the surface runoff, which shows 
gradual wash-out of fine particles from the 
slope.   
    
SOIL MOISTURE RESPONSE TO 
RAINFALL 
  Figure 8 shows typical examples of the 
responses of the water content (ω) vs. t curves 
measured on the left side, at the middle height 
of the slope (S = 0.9 m), under a constant 
rainfall intensity of I = 65 mm/hr.  The 
reason for selecting the MS at S = 0.9 m, 
rather than those at S = 0.46 m and S = 1.29 m 
as a typical example is because the MS at S = 
0.9 m is less influenced by the up-stream 
and/or down-stream boundaries of the model 
slope.  It was considered that the MS at S = 
0.9 m better simulates the in-soil moisture 
response for an infinite slope.  Fig. 8 shows 
the following trends : 
(1) The measured values of ω (or Sr) for the 
moisture sensors at the left and right 
sides of the central lines are similar, 
suggesting that a two-dimensional (2-D) 
infiltration condition has been achieved 
in this test. 
(2) The curves measured by the MS near the 
slope surface, namely M7 (upper-left) 
and M8 (upper-right) are characterized 
by a two-stage rising pattern which is 
different from the one-stage rising 
pattern for the moisture sensors at the 
base (or soil-base interface, M5 and M6) 
of the slope.  This is schematically 
shown in Fig. 11. 
Figure 9 shows plots similar to those shown 
in Fig. 8 except that Fig. 9 is for S = 0.46 m.  
In general, the moisture sensors located at the 
impermeable base (M1 and M2) show a 
one-step rise to a relatively high degree of 
saturation.  This is similar to that discussed 
for Fig. 8 earlier.  However, all the sensors 
show their maximum values of Sr to be about 
80% rather than 100%, due possibly to the 
fact that the toe reached the state of failure (or 
collapse) at a relatively early stage, changing 
the soil density from its initial state.  It can 
also be seen that the two-stage rising pattern 
observed in Fig. 8 is softened to some extent 
in this case.  Fig. 10 shows similar plots for 
MS at S = 1.29 m.  The response of the MS 
at the impermeable base shown in Fig. 8 is 
still valid in this case, while the maximum 
values of Sr for the MS found at the middle 
depth of the slope are only 60%-70% of those 
for M9 and M10 at the base.  This shows that 
a rise in the water table at the upper part of the 
slope is unlikely to occur because of 
dissipating seepage towards the toe of the 
slope by gravitational seepage force.  Based 
on the similar responses for the sensors on 
both the right and the left sides, the 
NSC_final report_2007.doc                                   7
piping. 
(2) The arrival time of the wet front at the 
soil-bedrock interface of the slope (Tm1(base)) 
provides an early indicator for the onset of 
wasting (defined by the inflection point of 
the Qs vs. t curve at which 0.5% < Qs < 1.2 
% of total volume of solid is wasted).
