be used, if necessary, by both large and small vehicles at no or affordable costs. This 
reduces the number of side trips to and from the PD for reloading and produces 
sufficient cost savings. 
From the entrepreneur’s point of view, PD is certainly more controllable than VD. 
However, due to high land prices, it is difficult for logistics companies to increase the 
number of PDs. Thus, the VD becomes important for improving the efficiency of 
delivery operations. If the number of VDs and their locations are fixed, the delivery 
operation will usually be less efficient because in many situations, VDs are different 
on each day depending on the business received. Therefore, it is reasonable to treat 
VDs as variables, rather than accommodating the rigid assumption of fixed VDs. This 
implies that if a type-I customer is serviced by the large vehicle, it will also act as a 
VD; otherwise, it will be treated as a type-II customer and serviced by a small vehicle. 
In addition, time constraints are also critical to the level of customer service as each 
customer is generally not able to receive service all day long and has its own time 
window for business transaction. 
Based on the aforementioned discussions, we propose a new type of delivery 
service with emphasis on variable VDs and time constraints: the linehaul-feeder 
vehicle routing problem with virtual depots and time windows (LFVRP-VD-TW). 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature 
review. Section 3 proposes a solution algorithm. Section 4 solves and analyzes 17 test 
problems. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a few remarks. 
2. Literature Review 
The LFVRP-VD-TW may be classified as a vehicle routing problem (VRP) 
(Bräysy and Gendreau, 2005a,b) with additional complexity generated by variable 
VDs and time constraints. Since this research topic is relatively new in the logistics 
area, few relevant articles can be found in the literature. 
The idea of VD is loosely related to the cross docking (CD) strategy, which has 
been adopted by global companies such as Wal-Mart and UPS to increase the speed of 
logistics and decrease inventory. In the CD strategy, the time schedules of inbound 
and outbound trucks are well planned, so that the products can be moved directly 
from receiving docks to shipping docks without being stored in the distribution center 
(Lee et al., 2006; Yu and Egbelu, 2008). In the LFVRP-VD-TW problem, however, 
the role of the distribution centers is replaced by the VDs, which may be on-street 
parking lots, off-street parking lots, or both; the products are directly transshipped 
from a large vehicle to one or more empty or near-empty smaller vehicles. Although 
the concept of CD is related to VD, the latter is more difficult, because the number of 
VDs and their locations in a system may not be specified and must be determined 
 4
pre-specified VDs. This strict assumption has been relaxed by Chen et al. (2008), 
resulting in a research named linehaul-feeder vehicle routing problem with virtual 
depots (LFVRP-VD). To solve the LFVRP-VD, two heuristics were proposed. 17 test 
problems, modified from a set of classical VRP benchmark situations, were 
extensively examined. The results show that the heuristic that embeds the cost-sharing 
method outperforms the heuristic that embeds the threshold method in terms of 
several selected performance measures. In addition, the more type-I customers 
available for the choice of VDs, the better objective value could be obtained. However, 
the LFVRP-VD is not quite persuasive, because time window constraints associated 
with customers are not considered. In the logistics market, customers are usually not 
open 24 hours a day; they must be serviced during a pre-specified time window. In 
consideration of these additional requirements, a new research topic emerges, the 
linehaul-feeder vehicle routing problem with virtual depots and time windows 
(LFVRP-VD-TW). 
From the above brief literature review, it is clear that none of existing articles has 
addressed both the issues of the variable VDs and time constraints in a VRP 
environment, which naturally become the focus of this study. 
3 Problem Description 
To illustrate the LFVRP-VD-TW, we use Figure 2 to elaborate. The sample 
network contains one PD, four type-I customers (a, b, c, d), two VDs (b, d), and 
eleven type-II customers. A fleet consisting of one large vehicle and two small 
vehicles are dispatched from the PD; the corresponding three vehicle routes are 
constructed as follows: 
Large vehicle route: PD→d(VD)→b(VD)→PD; 
Small vehicle 1 route: PD→2→3→d(VD)→7→9→10→PD; 
Small vehicle 2 route: PD→c→1→d(VD)→4→5→a→b(VD)→6→8→11→PD. 
It is observed that only two of four type-I customers are actually chosen as VD, 
i.e., nodes b and d. Of the two VDs, node d conducts reloading service twice, one for 
each small vehicle, while node b conducts reloading service only once for small 
vehicle 2. The reloading service can be exerted at a VD only when both the large 
vehicle and the small vehicle are present at the same time. Since the other two type-I 
customers, i.e., nodes a and c, are not chosen as a VD, they are treated as type-II 
customers and subsequently serviced by small vehicle 2.

Figure 3: Time-Space Diagram for LFVRP-VD-TW 
 
The LFVRP-VD-TW problem aims to achieve two goals and in the meantime to 
comply with three main constraints: 
1. Goals: (1) the total travel and waiting time for all vehicles is minimized; (2) 
workload among drivers is evenly distributed in terms of the number of 
customers serviced. 
2. Constraints: (1) Each customer must be serviced within a time window which is 
known and fixed. Hard time window definition is used; a vehicle can deliver to a 
customer only after the lower limit and before the upper limit of the time window. 
(2) Each small vehicle has a limited capacity; the capacity of the large vehicle is 
not considered. (3) The total work time of each driver cannot exceed a preset 
maximum work time length. 
For demonstration, we also make the following assumptions: 
1. Only one PD exists. 
2. The location and demand of each customer are known and fixed. 
3. The customers are classified into two groups: type-I customers can be serviced 
 8
vehicles. The large vehicle departs from the PD, services all VDs, and then returns to 
the PD. Small vehicles are routed to service all type-II customers subject to the four 
constraints previously described: customer time window, vehicle capacity, driver 
work time limitation, and even driver workload. Since the large vehicle route and 
small vehicle routes are interacted with each other, they cannot be constructed 
independently. We start by constructing a giant route for a single small vehicle, 
splitting the giant route into several small vehicle routes, determining VDs, and then 
constructing the route for the large vehicle. 
A giant route can be formed by dispatching a single small vehicle from the PD, 
servicing all type-II customers within time constraints, and then returning to the PD. 
The giant route is essentially equivalent to the solution of the traveling salesman 
problem with time windows (Gendreau et al., 1998). This giant route is then split 
evenly based on the number of estimated small vehicles; each small vehicle will form 
a route starting from the PD, servicing distributed type-II customer, reloading at either 
the PD or a VD, if necessary, and then returning to the PD. Constructing initial small 
vehicle routes for all small vehicles based on the giant route is analogous to the 
strategy of route-first-cluster-second that is commonly used for solving the VRP 
problem (Beasley, 1983) 
An unserviced type II customer with the maximum cost saving can be inserted 
into one of the small vehicle routes only when all of the four constraints are satisfied. 
When a dispatched small vehicle is empty or near-empty, a VD is used to reload. VDs 
are essentially chosen from the type-I customers. Since side trips to and from the VDs 
will inevitably affect the schedule of the subsequent customers, the remaining 
subroute must be rearranged for feasibility and optimality. If no additional type-II 
customer requires service after reloading at the VD, the side trip to and from this VD 
will be no longer needed and hence deleted from the subroute. The deleted VD, which 
is a type-I customer, will be treated as a type-II customer for insertion if its reloading 
function remains inactive throughout the entire procedure. 
After initial routes consisting of non-VD type-I and type-II customers are 
constructed for all small vehicles, the route for the large vehicle will be established 
accordingly. The entire process for constructing the initial solution shown in Figure 4 
is summarized as follows: 
Step 1:  Construct a single giant route for a small vehicle to service all type-II 
customers. Estimate the number of small vehicles needed for delivery 
operation by dividing the giant route travel time by the driver work time 
limitation. 
Step 2:  Consider unserviced type-II customers sequentially in the giant route 
 10

To better explain the proposed solution algorithm, we further elaborate the steps 
for constructing single giant route and multiple small vehicle routes, choosing VDs, 
and finding initial route solution in the following sections.

odd-numbered type-II customers, while the second small vehicle services 
even-numbered type-II customers. 
 
Figure 5: Construction of Multiple Small Vehicle Routes by Alternating Method 
(Resource: Chen et al., 2008)  
The alternating method just described is applied by considering two goals (i.e., 
balanced driver workload, and minimum insertion cost) and two constraints (i.e., 
customer time window, and driver work time). The vehicle capacity constraint is not 
treated at this moment. 
Customer time window and driver work time are two hard constraints which 
must be strictly satisfied for each type-II customer scheduled at the end of the small 
vehicle route. Furthermore, minimum insertion cost and balanced driver workload 
must also be considered: The insertion cost accrued is defined as follows: 
 
Insertion cost = (the travel time from the last type-II customer scheduled on the small 
vehicle to the newly scheduled type-II customer) + (the travel time from the newly 
scheduled type-II customer to the PD) - (the travel time between the last type-II 
customer on the small vehicle route and the PD) (2) 
 
The driver workload is measured by the number of type-II customers serviced. 
When the number of type-II customers serviced is evenly distributed among all 
drivers, the workload is balanced. 
To summarize, the four steps comprised of the first module for constructing 
multiple small vehicle routes are stated as follows: 
Step 1:  Select one route yet considered from all small vehicle routes. 
Step 2:  Check the first unserviced giant route customer for the time window and the 
driver work time constraints. If not satisfied, go to Step 4, otherwise, 
continue. 
 14
If the empty or near-empty small vehicles are farther apart than a preset travel 
distance at the time of reloading, the empty or near-empty small vehicles must split 
into clusters, each with a VD. Considering that the sub-optimal choice of VD based 
on the current cost information may later outperform the optimal choice of VD, the 
second choice of VD is kept for further consideration. More than one VD candidates 
considered for each cluster will result in many combinations for the final solution. For 
ease of understanding, we define the concepts of “vehicle cluster” and “VD 
combination” as follows: 
1.  Vehicle Cluster: When a small vehicle is empty or near-empty during delivery 
operation, reloading from the large vehicle is required before continuing work. 
To reduce the large vehicle’s travel cost, we group these small vehicles into 
clusters. A preset threshold defined by the largest travel time among all pairs of 
type-I customers determines each cluster. One VD is needed in each cluster for 
reloading. If two empty or near-empty small vehicles are very close which is 
within the preset threshold, then these two small vehicles are grouped in the 
same cluster; otherwise, they are separated into two different clusters. One 
cluster scenario can be observed in Figure 6 on which the first- and 
second-choice VDs are type-I customers c and d, respectively. Two cluster 
scenario is also depicted in Figure 7 on which the first- and second-choice VDs 
are type-I customers d and c for the first vehicle and type-I customers c and b for 
the second vehicle. 
 
Figure 6: Scenario with One Cluster Figure 7: Scenario with Two Clusters 
 
2.  VD Combination: When only one cluster exists, there is no need for VD 
combination. For example, in Figure 6, one of VD candidates c, d will be chosen 
as a VD and visited by the large vehicle. However, when two or more clusters are 
formed, different combinations of VD candidates must be considered. In Figure 7, 
with VD candidates (c,b) in one cluster and VD candidates (d,c) in another 
 16
solution, a local search method such as the k-opt exchange method is often used. 
However, due to the complexity of the LFVRP-VD-TW problem, this type of 
methods is not ideal, because it is easily trapped within a local region. To move out of 
the local region and explore a wider area in the feasible region, meta-heuristics 
methods such as the Tabu search (Glover, 1989; 1990) offer great potential. In this 
research, we propose a method that combines the local search and Tabu search 
methods to improve the initial solution. 
The local search method is able to explore the neighborhood area, while the Tabu 
search is able to explore a wider area. The Tabu search includes six components: 
initial solution, neighborhood solution, move, Tabu list, aspiration criterion, and 
stopping criterion. The initial solution is generated in Section 4.1. A neighborhood 
solution is usually obtained by exchanging randomly selected nodes in pairs of routes. 
The move refers to a change from one solution to another. The Tabu list defines a set 
of unfavorable elements. Aspiration criterion requires that the new solution be better 
than the existing solution. The stopping criterion is set as a maximum number of 
iterations. The improvement procedure (Figure 8) is described as follows:

5. Test Results and Analysis 
The LFVRP-VD-TW is essentially an extension of LFVRP-VD (Chen et. al, 
2008). 17 test problems were adopted from the VRP web and the LFVRP-VD with 
necessary modifications. The general information associated with these problems is 
shown in the following. 
(1) single PD; 
(2) triangular inequality relations of customers distance are held in the network; 
(3) all pairs of customers are connected; 
(4) link travel distances of small vehicles are represented by the Euclidian 
distance between the two customers 
(5) link travel costs of small vehicles are represented by the corresponding link 
travel distances divided by 40 km/hr; and 
(6) link travel costs of the large vehicle are 1.5 times higher than those of small 
vehicles. 
The test results for the LFVRP-VD-TW are summarized in Table 1.

The results shown in Table 2 are inferior to those in Table 3 in all performance 
indices except for the average improvement rate. The possible reasons are twofold: 
1. This research adheres to the driver work time constraint throughout the entire 
 22
of small vehicles required for delivery and constructing feasible small vehicle 
routes. In other words, in addition to the travel time for servicing customers, the 
travel time to and from VDs for reloading is also taken into account during the 
construction of multiple small vehicle routes. As a result, performance indices 
such as objective function value and the number of small vehicles required are 
worse than their corresponding counterparts in the LFVRP-VD. 
2. In the second stage, the inter-route node exchange method and the Tabu search 
method are combined to improve the quality of the initial solution. The CPU times 
required for the initial and final solutions are 0.07 sec and 54.61 sec, respectively; 
the major portion of the computational time is spent on the Tabu search. However, 
the Tabu search yields an average improvement rate of 14.23%, which is much 
better than that for the LFVRP-VD. 
 
To improve this research, there are several issues regarding computation 
efficiency and practical applications worth further exploration. In view of the 
complexity of LFVRP-VD-TW, multiple agent meta-heuristics such as genetic 
algorithm, ant algorithm, harmony search method, and water flow-like algorithm may 
be able to further enhance the overall computational efficiency and solution quality. 
For practical applications, additional factors need to be considered, such as soft 
time window constraints, pickup and delivery operations, vehicle purchase cost, fixed 
number of small vehicles, and capacity constraint for the large vehicle. In addition, 
link travel times may differ due to traffic, road work, accidents, etc. Therefore, 
time-dependent, rather than fixed, link travel times should be used in real world 
problem solving. Furthermore, customers must be added or canceled in a real-time 
manner during delivery operation because this situation is commonly seen in the real 
world. 
Finally, as for many other VRP problems, real applications for the 
LFVRP-VD-TW problem are essential. In this paper the LFVRP-VD-TW did not 
demonstrate with real-world companies such as FedEx, DHL, and Takkyubin-cat 
because real data are not available to us. Nevertheless, this is inevitably an immediate 
research in the future.
