2其認為活動主體內心存有自由意志(free will)，而自由意志將合理化地操控人類行為。迪
卡兒(Rene Descartes)透過二元研究法(dualistic approach)發現，人與動物之差別在於操控
活動行為的過程。此二元理論後來則受到達爾文(Darwin)之「適者生存」學說的挑戰。
達爾文認為，促使動物(包括人類)產生行為的原動力是生存。人類和低等動物的差別在
於，人類具有改變其生活環境及行為之能力，並非僅是操控活動行為過程上的差異。佛
洛依德(Freud)透過心理分析方法進一步證明，生存需求是如何影響活動行為，其研究更
影響到後世研究者，而發展出人類行為研究法(humanistic approach)。
人類行為研究法係將以往的動機理論加以延伸，Maslow(1970)將人類行為加以延
伸，並闡明人們為了自我實現所必需的條件。其將「不足」從成長動機中區別出來，並
強調任何的不足(不論是心理或生理的)都將使人們產生新的成長。
在活動分析研究領域中，Fried et al.(1977)提出一個可以因應外在環境變動的時間分
派理論。其理論強調活動主體行為調適的動態過程，認為人們會將外在環境的影響調整
至平衡狀態。
綜合上述文獻回顧可知，動機理論認為人的行為是由某種意念所操控，而此意念即
為「生存」。活動主體為了生存，便會調整己身的行為，以適應外在之環境條件；更甚
者，則會為了滿足己身之不足，而產生設法進步的行為(此即為文明進展之原因)。
(二)社會學與規劃學理論
和前述(一)中所提之理論不同，社會學與規劃學理論更直接地提及時間分派；在社
會學的研究中，其係以「資源理論(resource theory)」及「性別角色」對時間分派之影響
做為研究核心。Geerken與Gove(1983)曾提出「不完美效用最大化 (imperfect utility
maximization)，其認為在某些情境下，家戶的時間決策(或時間安排方式)也許並非是最
佳的，反而可能是面對著一連串錯誤選擇的軌跡前進。
在規劃學領域中，Chapin係在都市計畫架構內，由社會學、人類學的立場來分析人
們活動的類型(Chapin, 1965；1974)。為了滿足本能(食、衣、住、行、醫)需求外，人們
還需要從事「賺取收入」的活動；此外，還有廣泛參與社會╱休閒之類的活動。其特徵
為：視活動乃反映人們價值觀的一種選擇結果，屬於心理因素的強調。但應用於實際的
分析上時，卻只有適合環境「限制」下的行為能被觀察收集到。被觀察到的行為，只不
過是選擇方案集合全體中的某一部份而已，在全體未能明確的情況下，人們仍未能把握
到行為的真正意義。Hägerstrand(1970)，則由生理學、經濟學、文化、空間等各種角度，
來強調「時空制約」對選擇的影響。有關生理上、利用可能手段的容量等「能力的制約」；
人、工具、材料須同時共存於某地點等「結合的制約」；某時間、地點不能有人們(活動)
存在等「權力的制約」均屬之。而其研究的重點則為：活動主體的活動於時空上將為一
連續性的存在，如同於場所間的移動會消費時間一樣，空間次元可藉時間次元加以表現
出來，此時，時間與空間則具有相互關係。除了強調限制與選擇之外，在規劃學領域中
也特別強調活動類型之研究。其將人們每日/每週所從事的活動加以分類，並探討影響各
活動類型的時間分派行為(Reichmann，1976；Aas，1982)。
綜合上述文獻回顧可知，在社會學與規劃學研究領域中，強調的是活動主體所面對
之「環境限制」，認為人們在受限的狀況下進行活動時間的分派。而環境限制及活動主
4進行家戶調查時，係對家戶中年滿15歲之所有共住成員進行訪問，總計得553個樣本。
由於受訪者係依比例分佈於六大行政區內，故所蒐集之資料應能呈現出台南市居民的一
般化行為。
五、模式結果與討論
本研究假設受訪者之時間使用係，透過「時間使用的實際狀態」、「時間分配滿意度」
及「生活滿意度」之連結，而形成一個具有階層性的結構關係。以下將針對此結構關係
做初步分析與討論，其內容包括：平日與假日休閒時間與休閒時間分配滿意度之關
係、平日與假日休息時間與休息時間分配滿意度之關係、平日與假日家庭相處時間
與家庭相處時間分配滿意度之關係、休息時間與健康水準之關係、個人休閒時間與
休閒效果之關係，及家庭休閒時間與家庭成員互動時間之關係。
(一)休閒時間與時間分配滿意度之關係
表1中之「假日自己外出日數」係指「受訪者於假日時，為從事自己喜愛的活動，
而獨自外出的日數」。而「平日個人休閒時間」則係指「受訪者於平日時，在一日內為
從事自己喜愛的活動，而獨自利用的時間」。在分組的設定方面，係將資料依序(由小到
大)排列，將人數均分為三組，以33.33百分位數及66.67百分位數所對應之近似值做為區
隔點。

（）中之數值為樣本數
若單就「平日與家人一起在家的時間」來看，「時間分配滿意度」並不會隨著「平
日與家人一起在家的時間」增加而不斷上升，而是在「平日與家人一起在家的時間2~3
小時(含)」時發生停滯現象。此似乎亦和上述(一)的分析相互呼應，顯示出受訪者在平
日安排「個人自由時間(個人休息與個人休閒)」時，有可能會受到「約束時間」和「必
要時間」的共同限制，造成個人在安排「個人自由時間」的活動內容與活動持續時間受
到限制。再就「假日與家人一同外出日數」而言，「與家人相處時間滿意度」並不會一
直隨著「假日與家人一同外出日數」增加而上升，其亦在「假日與家人一同外出日數1~2
日」時出現轉折現象。而此結果正可與前述(一)、(二)之結果相呼應，顯示出受訪者在
進行假日時間分配的時候，也會受到「時間制約條件」的限制。
(四)休息時間與健康水準之關係
圖2的橫軸為休息時間滿意度，共分為五等第，分別為「很不滿意」、「不滿意」、「普
通」、「滿意」、「很滿意」。而對於健康水準滿意度方面，則僅區分為三等第，分別「不
滿意」、「普通」、「滿意」。在此必須說明的是，在進行問卷調查時，係以「七等第」的
方式分別詢問受訪者對「休息時間」與「健康水準」的滿意度，故分析時應會有7 7 49 
個分段直條；但為能清楚呈現上述兩者之關係，乃重新進行了簡化的設定。
由圖2顯示，「休息時間滿意度」愈高則「健康水準的滿意度」也隨之提高；而「休
息時間滿意度」愈低則「健康水準的滿意度」也愈低，兩者有同向變動的趨勢。然而，
當「休息時間滿意度」高到一定程度時，「健康水準的滿意度」便不會再提高，反而會
降低一些。此顯示，當休息時間到達一定水準時，受訪者對健康水準滿意度之感受即不
會有太大變化。
(五)個人休閒時間與休閒效果之關係
圖3是以「休閒效果滿意度」與「個人休閒時間滿意度」進行分析。由圖可知，當
「個人休閒時間滿意度」低時，其「個人休閒效果滿意度」的不滿意度會最高；而當受
訪者對個人休閒時間給予較高評價時，其「個人休閒效果滿意度」也會提高。由此可知，
受訪者對休閒時間的評價，會確實地反映於「個人休閒效果滿意度」上。隨著週休二日
制的實施，個人的休閒時間增加之後，更能有足夠的時間安排休閒活動，而休閒時間的
增加也會使休閒效果更為提高。
8分析樣本中有極明顯或過多的極端值，會對統計分析造成影響並產生偏誤的結果。為了
減少極端值對統計分析的影響，因此在資料輸入模式進行分析之前，需先對樣本進行檢
核的動作。在此，本研究將極端值的定義設定為「超過樣本平均數三倍標準差之樣本
值」。經過分析之後，刪除了53個具有極端值的樣本，最終以500個受訪者的樣本資料來
進行PA-OV模式的建構。
本研究使用LISREL軟體來進行模式校估(estimate)工作，並以最大概似法(maximum
likelihood)來進行模式參數的校估，至於模式選取的參數，則如表4所示。在經過一連串
嘗試與修正之後，得出了最終PA-OV模式，其結果如圖5所示，模式的適配度評鑑資訊
則整理於表5。綜合上述之分析可知，本研究建構的理論模型具有高度的說明力。

家庭休閒時間的滿意度也會隨之提升；而在從事休閒活動時，人們除了考慮到己身的嗜
好活動之外，也會考慮到該活動是否能和家人一同進行。當該項休閒活動一方面可滿足
活動主體之需求，另一方面又可滿足活動主體之家庭成員的需求時，便可有效提升活動
主體之「家庭休閒時間滿意度」。
會對「個人休閒時間的滿意度」產生直接影響的因素為：「自宅外休閒活動時間
(0.23)」。顯而易見，當活動主體花費越多時間在自宅外休閒活動時，所獲得的效用也將
直接透過個人休閒時間的滿意度來表現出來。對於交通規劃的啟示則為，若將「前往活
動地點的交通時間」與「從事休閒活動時間」結合考量，透過某些管制手法，將交通時
間予以縮短，被節省下來的交通時間，將被活動主體轉用於從事休閒活動時間，此將可
提升活動主體的效用。
4.「時間使用的實際狀態」對「生活總體滿意度」之整體效果分析
路徑分析可區分出各變數間之直接效果和間接效果，變數間的直接效果係以圖5之
路徑係數來表示之。兩個變數之間，若具有一個或多個中介變數(mediated variable)，便
可能存在間接效果。每個自變項對每個內生變項的整體效果(total effect)，可以將路徑模
型中與該自變項和內衍變項有關的直接效果和間接效果加總而得之。
在此部份，將針對「自宅外休閒活動時間」、「和家中成員互動時間」、「就寢前在自
宅內休息的時間」、「假日跟家人在宅日數」及「假日跟家人外出日數」等變數對「生活
總體滿意度」之影響效果進行分析。
由表6可知，在平日的時間使用方面，當活動主體可以分配越多的時間於宅外休閒
活動，或是花較多的時間在和家中成員互動，會有效地提升其生活總體滿意度，此結果
也與前述3.中的分析結果相呼應。
在假日的時間使用方面，與其增加和家人一同外出的日數，倒不如增加和家人同留
在家中的日數，更能夠增進活動主體之生活總體滿意度。若依一般經驗可知，若全家人
欲在假日一同出遊，在數日前，甚至數週前便須開始進行計畫。在平日的勞累之後，假
日出遊不僅不能獲得充份的休息，還須費心於照顧家人或處理行程雜務，如此一來，便
無法有效地提升生活總體滿意度。但若於假日中，能與家人同留家中，彼此閒聊或從事
輕鬆的休閒活動，對於提升生活總體滿意度將有較佳的效果。

八、計畫成果自評
本研究透過 PA-OV 模式，來探討「時間使用的實際狀態」、「時間分配滿意度」、「生活
目的滿意度」之間的因果關係，不論是在研究方法與理論架構上，似乎都是目前國內所僅
見；而其對都市裡上班者的時間使用行為之分析，應能讓相關規劃者加以思考運用，故
亦具有實務參考價值。

weekends and life satisfaction, employing Path Analysis with Observed Variables(PA-OV). 
Consequently, all causal relationship among variables can be examined and recognized. This article 
are divided into four parts : (1)Literature Review, (2)Survey Summary and Research Content, 
(3)Empirical Analysis and (4)Conclusion. 
 
II. Literature Review 
Theories about the use of time can be roughly divided into three parts. The first kind is 
“motivation theory”, proposed by anthropologists and psychologists, which specifically emphasizes 
the inherent motivation whereby people arrange their time. The second kind of theory is put forward 
from sociology and city planning field: “sociological and planning theory”, which provides a 
method to directly observe people’s time use behaviors. The third kind is “economic theory,” 
derived from microeconomics. This theory employs a mathematical model to analyze how people 
use time, which is characterized as merit. Nevertheless, this theory has not incorporated the 
influential factors mentioned by motivation theory or other non-economic theories, which may 
render the model incomplete. The following will use the forgoing classification to review literature 
on the use of time in recently years.   
 
(1) Motivational Theory 
The earliest theory of human behavior was proposed by Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato, 
who consider that individual free will rationalize the domination of human behavior. Through a 
“dualistic approach”, Rene Descartes discovered that the difference between human beings and 
animals lie in the process of activity manipulation and control. This dualistic theory was later 
challenged by Darwin’s theory of “survival of the Fittest”. For Darwin, survival is the primary 
incentive behind animals’ behavior (including human beings). Human beings differ from animals in 
that they have the ability to change their environment and behavior. It is not merely restricted to the 
difference in the process of manipulating activity behavior. Freud further discovered how the need 
for survival influences activity behavior through psychological analysis, and his research 
subsequently affected researchers of the later generation, who then developed the “humanistic 
approach”.  
 Humanistic approach is the elaboration of the motivation theory. Maslow(1970) extends 
human behavior and elaborates on the necessity for people’s self-realization. Furthermore, he 
differentiates “deficiency” from growth motivation and emphasizes that any deficiency 
(psychological or physical) will make people grow.  
  In the activity analysis research fields, Fried et al. (1977) proposed a time allocation theory 
which is capable of adapting to the changes of environment. The theory puts emphasis on the 
dynamic process of individuals’ behavior adjustment and proposes that people will adjust to the 
impacts of environment in order to maintain a state of equilibrium. 
   The above discussion shows that motivational theory claims that people’s behavior is 
manipulated and controlled by certain kind of will and the will denotes “survival”. In order to 
survive, individuals will adjust their behavior to adapt to the environment. What’s more, human 
 8
Becker (1965) indicated in his time economics model that individuals must consume time in 
order to fulfill their life purposes. He suggested that time itself encompasses values and after 
individuals consume time, efficiency will emerge. Okumura and Tsukai (1999), however, proposed 
that when individuals conduct the allocation of time of weekdays and weekends, there must be an 
evaluation framework of time allocation and they will carry out time allocation on the basis of this 
evaluation framework. Since individuals play simultaneously different kinds of social roles, they 
will take into account their social roles when allocating time. This concept is also mentioned by 
Golob and McNally (1995), who utilize structure equation to conceptualize the allocation of time 
concerning indifferent activities.  
 Economic theory makes use of mathematical methods to develop an economic theory model, 
which obviously advances manipulation and control; however, in order to fulfill the postulation of 
the model and the mathematical operation, many qualitative indicators cannot but be neglected to 
some extent. This condition diverts this model from reality and consequently becomes a 
shortcoming for this economic theory. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that using mathematical 
methods to comprehend human behavior and provide a corresponding policy has its advantages, 
specifically where scientific studies rely on economic theories for support.  
 
III. Survey Summary and Research Content 
(1) Survey Summary 
This study chose six large districts in Tainan City (the east, the middle-east, the south, the north, 
An-Ping and An-Nan) as the scope of research. Quota sampling (sampling according to the 
proposition of the population in each district) was employed to conduct household interviews with 
Tainan citizens, with a total number of 200 households. The household interviews were targeted at 
all household members aged 15 or older. A total of 553 samples were collected. Data collection was 
distributed to six large districts in order to better represent the ordinary behavior patterns of Tainan 
citizens. 
The following illustrates the statistical analysis of interviewees’ occupation, age and average 
salary. Figure 1 showed that among the interviewees, employed participants occupied the largest 
proportion, or 65.64%. The second largest proportion of participants was students, or 22.97%. The 
third was housewives, approximately 6.69%. The smallest proportion was unemployed, or 4.70%. 
Figure 2 illustrates that the largest proportion of interviewees were in the age range of 20~30 years 
old, or 26.58%. The second largest was ranged from “40~50 years old, or 25.86%; the third largest 
ranged from “30~40 years old, or 17.90%. 
Figure 3 showed that among the interviewees, those whose average salary was below 40,000 
occupied the largest proportion, or 58.95%. The second largest ranged between 40,000~80,000, or 
22.24%. The third largest was no income, at 13.38%. The smallest population was those whose 
average salary was above 120,000, or 1.45 %. “40~50 years old, or 25.86%; the third largest ranged 
from “30~40 years old, or 17.90%.

In Figure 4, 1 indicates the actual status of time use, and the allocation of time use is divided 
into weekday time use and weekend time use. In the aspect of weekday time use, three indices are 
considered: “time spent on out-of-home leisure activities”, “time spent on family interaction”, and 
“time spent on indoor rest before going to sleep”; in the aspect of weekend time use, two indices are 
considered: “the number of weekend days when staying at home with household members”, and 
“the number of weekend days when going out with household members”. The actual status of time 
use of individuals can be anticipated to be reflected by the indices above. 2 indicates the 
satisfaction with time allocation, which is used to examine the levels of satisfaction with individuals 
with the amount of time allocated to each and every activity by using the following three indices: 
“satisfaction with rest time”, “satisfaction with indoor leisure time” and “satisfaction with personal 
leisure time”. e indicates the satisfaction with life, which is used to examine the levels of 
satisfaction with individuals with the achievement of each life purpose by using the following four 
indices: “satisfaction with money sufficiency”, “satisfaction with health conditions”, “satisfaction 
with family interaction” and “satisfaction with leisure activities”. This study hypothesizes that the 
purpose of efforts invested by individuals in life is to achieve their goals in life. Following such 
hypothesis, a causal relationship will be developed among actual status of time use, satisfaction 
with time allocation and satisfaction with life; this is the evaluation framework of activity time 
postulated in this study. Each index is detailed as Table 1. 
Given that we consider this to be a causal relationship, a sequence of policy-making will be 
obtained. Regarding the individuals in level 3 (satisfaction with life), in addition to income and 
health needs, interaction of household members or engagement in leisure activities provide 
individuals with a wide variety of different amusements or sense of fulfillment. In order to fulfill 
their goals in life, individuals must consume a certain amount of time. However, it seems 
impossible to fulfill all one’s goals within a limited period of time when individuals because their 
time is constrained by necessities discussed in the introduction (i.e. job, school, commuting, 
sleeping, etc.). As a result, individuals will allocate their time in the light of how they value various 
activities, which is presented in level 2. In addition, it should be taken into account when the 
activity is implemented (during weekdays or weekends) as well as how much time is allocated to 
the activity. If there is not sufficient time to accomplish the activity during weekdays, the activity 
will take place during the weekend. Consequently, time is allocated to both weekdays and weekends, 
as presented in level 1. In the next section, a demonstrative analysis of path analysis model will be 
conducted using the evaluation framework of activity time shown in Figure 4.

(1) Model Establishing Process and Results 
This study conducted household interviews with Tainan citizens, with a total number of 200 
households sampled. The household interviews were targeted at all household members aged 15 or 
older and 553 samples were collected in total. After data collection was completed, a statistical 
analysis was performed on these data, and the result revealed that samples of partial variables had 
outliers. If there are very obvious or too many outliers in analysis samples, influence will be given 
rise to on the statistical analysis and erroneous results will occur.  
To minimize such influence of outliers on statistical analysis, verification should be carried out 
on samples before data are input into the model to allow analysis to be made. In this study, the 
outlier is defined as the sample value exceeding three standard deviation of mean value of samples. 
As a result, 53 samples with outliers were gotten grid of, and PA-OV model was developed by using 
sample data of the remaining 500 interviewees finally. 
This study used LISREL software to estimate this model and maximum likelihood method to 
estimate model parameters. After a succession of trials and corrections, the final PA-OV model was 
formulated eventually, with its results as shown in Figure 5, and the evaluation information of 
model goodness-of-fit is summarized in Table 2. 
This study employed Chi-Square Test ( 2χ  test) to test the goodness-of-fit of theoretical matrix 
(predicted values) and view matrix (actual values), in order to show the explanatory power of this 
model. In Chi-Square Test, its null hypothesis is: there is no difference between theoretical matrix 
and view matrix. Therefore, the more the calculated Chi-square value approximates to zero, the 
more the predication ability of this model is very perfect. The 
2χ  value of the model developed in 
this study is 54.80, indicating null hypothesis is true and the model goodness-of-fit is perfect. 
 The larger number of degree of freedom means more parameters shall be estimated, namely, 
there are more factors influencing the hypothetical model, and there is a higher possibility that bad 
theoretical model goodness-of-fit will be resulted as well, thus, Chi-square value is less able to used 
to check whether theoretical model can reflect observed data or not. Therefore, the ratio of 
Chi-Square to degree of freedom ( 2 dfχ ) is employed to test the model in order to minimize the 
influence of degree of freedom on test. Carmines and McIver (1981) suggested that the ratio of 
Chi-Square to degree of freedom of no more than two serves as an adequate indicator of model 
goodness-of-fit. In this study, the ratio of Chi-Square to degree of freedom is 1.166, less than 2.0, 
denoting the model has an ideal goodness-of-fit. 
Both GFI (goodness-of-fit index) and AGFI (adjusted GFI) have standard characteristics: their 
values lie between 0 and 1, and the more the values come close to 1, the better the goodness-of-fit is, 
on the contrary, the more the values departure from 1, the worse the goodness-of-fit is. Generally, a 
model is considered to have an ideal goodness-of-fit only when its values of GFI and AGFI are 
larger than 0.90. From Table 2, the GFI value of the theoretical model developed in this study is

(2) Analysis on influential factors of overall satisfaction with life (A1)  
It is clear from Fig. 5 that factors directly influencing overall satisfaction with life (A1) can be 
sorted in decreasing order by the “direct effect” of individual factors as follows: satisfaction with 
family interaction (0.32), satisfaction with money sufficiency (0.26), Satisfaction with leisure 
activities (0.17), satisfaction with indoor leisure time (0.15) and satisfaction with rest time (0.10). 
And it may be known from such sort that both family harmony and income sufficiency are what are 
still highly valued by people. As the old saying goes, if the family lives in harmony, all affairs will 
prosper; findings of this study are in line with it. 
 
(3) Analysis on influential factors of satisfaction with life  
Four indices are set to measure the satisfaction with life: satisfaction with money sufficiency, 
satisfaction with health conditions, satisfaction with family interaction and Satisfaction with leisure 
activities, and their influential factors are described as follows respectively: 
Factors that may directly influence the satisfaction with money sufficiency include: 
satisfaction with indoor leisure time (0.27), satisfaction with health conditions (0.20) and 
satisfaction with family interaction (0.17). The values of these factors indicate that the measurement 
of monetary values is still based on family harmony and health conditions. 
Factors that may directly influence the satisfaction with health conditions include: Satisfaction 
with leisure activities (0.33), satisfaction with personal leisure time (0.23) and satisfaction with rest 
time (0.13). The results of these factors indicate that if adequately participating in leisure activities 
or taking a rest after the work will be very helpful to people, physiologically or psychologically. 
Factors that may directly influence the satisfaction with family interaction include: Satisfaction 
with leisure activities (0.32), number of weekend days when staying at home with household 
members (0.18), satisfaction with health conditions(0.15) and satisfaction with personal leisure 
time(-0.11). The results of these factors indicate that the interaction with family members shouldn’t 
be restrained only in home; instead, the effective way is to mutually participate in leisure activities, 
and to increase interaction between family members. On the other hand, high level of satisfaction 
with personal leisure time will directly decrease the satisfaction with family interaction, that is, if a 
person spends more time in his own leisure activities, his time spent on interaction with his family 
members will be decreased correspondingly. 
Factors that may directly influence the Satisfaction with leisure activities include: satisfaction 
with personal leisure time (0.52), satisfaction with rest time (0.15) and satisfaction with money 
sufficiency (0.10). It is worthwhile to note that the direct effect of satisfaction with personal leisure 
time is 0.52, far higher than those of other two influential factors. Thus it is clear that individuals 
prefer to engage in their favorite activities and it may be considered that if the level of satisfaction

effect and indirect effect related to this independent variable and this endogenous variable in the 
path model. 
In this part, the influential effects of the time spent on out-of-home leisure activities, time 
spent on family interaction, time spent on indoor rest before going to sleep, number of weekend 
days staying at home with household members and number of weekend days going out with 
household members on overall satisfaction with life will be analyzed. 
It may be known from Table 3 that with regard to weekend time use, when individuals allocate 
more time spent on out-of-home leisure activities or on interaction activities with their family 
members, their overall satisfaction with life will be effectively enhanced. This result is in line with 
the analysis result in point (IV). 
With regard to weekday time use, it is better to increase the number of days of staying at home 
with household members than the number of days of going out with household members, because 
this can more increase the overall satisfaction with life of individuals. According to general 
experiences, if all household members of a family want to go out together on a weekend day, they 
have to start to make plan for it in advance of several days or even several weeks. After weariness 
out of work at weekdays, an outing can not provide an adequate rest, but requires efforts made to 
take care of family members or handle journey affairs, thus, the overall satisfaction with life can’t 
be effectively enhanced. However, if it is possible to stay at home with family members, chatting or 
engaging in pleasant leisure activities together, the overall satisfaction with life will be enhanced 
significantly.

V. Conclusion 
This study placed an overall consideration on the close correlation between the use of time 
during weekdays and weekends and questionnaire surveys were conducted on both simultaneously. 
It was hypothesized that a hierarchical structural relationship could be established between the 
allocation of time of interviewees, which contained 3 levels such as actual status of time use, 
satisfaction with time allocation and satisfaction with life. Subsequently, this structural relationship
