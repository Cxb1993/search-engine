4Introduction
In recent years, Six Sigma and Lean methodologies were popularized because their
successful implementations by many world-class companies/organizations around the world.
Six Sigma has become the core initiative in contemporary quality management systems (Harry
and Schroeder, 2000). The key success factors of Six Sigma are: (1) the emphasis on
statistical science and measurement; (2) a rigorous and structured training deployment plan
(Champion, Master Black Belt, Black Belt and Green Belt); (3) a project-focused approach with
a single set of problem solving techniques such as DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve,
Control); (4) reinforcement of Juran’s tenets of top management leadership, continuous 
education and an annual savings plan (Basu, 2004, Snee, 2004, Su and Kano 2003).
On the other hand, the fundamental ideas of Lean were derived from those of the Toyota
Production System, which, in turn, were derived from Henry Ford’s breakthroughs at Ford 
Motors early in the twentieth century (Womack, 1990, 1996, and 2004). The objective of Lean
is to rapidly respond to changing customer demands and to create more value at a lower cost.
To achieve this objective, Lean provides a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating
waste, i.e. non-value-added activities, that inflate costs, lead times and inventory
requirements, through continuous improvement by flowing the product/service at the pull of
the customers in pursuit of perfection (McAdam and Evans, 2004; George, 2003; Nave, 2002)..
As a whole, Lean is a five-step methodology for a lean transformation in an organization. We
will describe these steps in detail later in this paper.
It is readily apparent that the fusion of lean and Six Sigma improvement methods is
required because each can be reinforced by the complementary results from the other. In
addition, it is important to determine whether and how the Lean Six Sigma can be applied to
the service quality improvement. By combing the advantages of Lean and Six Sigma, we
attempt to develop a Lean Six Sigma methodology for service quality improvement. An
empirical case study of patent filing services was conducted to verify the validity and
demonstrate the practices of the Lean Six Sigma methodology.
Developing a Lean Six Sigma methodology
Since DMAIC is generally regarded as a virtually unassailable credo in the area of Six
Sigma process improvement (Upton, 2004), we will follow its well-proven discipline to develop
a Lean Six Sigma methodology under the process umbrella of DMAIC cycle without losing the
well-established groundwork. A conceptual steps of the Lean Six Sigma methodology for
service quality improvement that we will propose is depicted as follows.
Phase 1: Define / Identify Value
Step 1: First identify the voice of customer (VOC), i.e. the key attributes that are valued
by either the external or internal customers in the service settings.
Step 2: Translate those attributes identified in step 1 into measurable
requirements because they could be qualitative in nature.
6corporate objective to be among the top ten patent filing service providers in the nation in
terms of the annual total number of patents approved. Moreover, when it is possible,
customers prefer a stable and consistent schedule for the completion of a patent filing process.
Lastly, according to a survey conducted between the customers and employees of the patent
service firm, it revealed that the patent engineers in the firm often spent too much time on the
processes of correcting technical specifications, writing disclosure documents, and searching
reports. This has become a major bottleneck issue in the whole process of the patent filing
services.
Implementing the Lean Six Sigma Methodology
Phase 1: Define / Identify Value
Step 1: The voices of both the internal and external customers can be identified
as follows.
 A shorter patent filing interval than it is used to be.
 Achieving the corporate objective to be among top ten patent filing service
providers in the nation.
 Reducing the time which the patent engineers spent on the processes of correcting
specifications, writing disclosure documents, and searching reports.
Step 2: Concerning the key attributes identified in step 1, we translate each of those
attributes into a measurable item as follows.
 A cycle time relates to the patent filing interval.
 A throughput accounts for the annual total number of patents approved.
 A process cycle efficiency relates to the amount of value-added time to the total
lead time of the process (George, 2003). It can be a metric for measuring the
performance of the patent engineer.
Step 3: Among the metrics defined in step 2, we identified the CTQs as the
cycle time since it has a direct impact on throughput and process
cycle efficiency.
Phase 2: Measure / Value Stream Mapping
Step 1: Once the CTQs, i.e. cycle time, was identified in the Define phase, a data collection
plan is developed to gather sample data. In this sample, 70 previous cases in total
of 250 were randomly selected for a survey for a certain eight-month time period.
The data collected was summarized in Table 1.

Cycle time

Step 2: Construct a current-state value stream map as shown in Figure 1. By examining
this map, two non-value-added steps are identified and should be eliminated.
Moreover, as it was highlighted in the problems section of this case study, the time
spent on drafting the patent specifications by patent engineers is considered to be

Step 4: The upper and lower specification levels are determined for the cycle
time of each input/output item.
Step 5: Develop an implementation plan for achieving the ideal/future states
from the existing conditions.
Phase 3: Analyze / Determine Root Causation
Step 1: By looking into the cycle time data in each step of the current/future-state value
stream maps and the detailed process map, the problem of long total process cycle
time can be easily analyzed. It was discovered that there exists a huge gap between
the ideal and existing amount of time spent on drafting the patent specifications by
the patent service firm.
Step 2: The root causes of long total process cycle time were identified by using
the cause-and-effect diagram as shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3: The cause-and-effect diagram of long total process cycle time
Step 3: Among the root causes as depicted in Figure 3, we concluded that the background
of the patent engineer and the associated level between the patent engineer’s 
background and the type of the case addressed would have a significant impact on the
total process cycle time.

Conclusions and Discussion
One of the major findings in this study was that the average total process cycle time for a
patent filing service case was reduced by 29.7 days or 31.9% equivalent compared with the
patent filing performance before implementing the Lean Six Sigma methodology, and it also
exceeds the firm’s target number, i.e. 75 days.  This achievement in cycle time reduction 
implies that the Lean Six Sigma methodology has proven its power to accelerate the process
flow by eliminating the non-value-added steps while also streamlining the remaining
value-added steps. In addition, this result also means that the patent filing interval can be
enhanced through the use of this Lean Six Sigma process. As well, it is encouraging to see that
the standard deviation has decreased by 5.5 days or 68.8% equivalent and, meanwhile it
outperforms the target performance level. These results indicate that a more stable and
consistent schedule for the completion of a patent cycle was established, which was a
significant improvement over the results obtained prior to the implementation of the Lean Six
Sigma methodology.
Using Six Sigma project terminology, this project achieved a 4.68-sigma quality level
result combining hard and soft savings valued at US$121,090 annually based on the
calculations of the obtained data. The hard savings refer to the Six Sigma project benefits that
allowed this firm to do same amount of business with less employees or handle more business
without adding people. On the other hand, soft savings are Six Sigma project benefits such as
reduced time to market, cost avoidance, improved employee morale, and other intangibles
which contributed additional savings to the firm.
