optical properties zirconium oxide has, the 
thin films are widely applied as 
high-reflectivity mirrors, active 
electro-optical device [2]. Zirconium oxide is 
also a promising high-κ candidate in the 
electronics industries. The higher dielectric 
constant may improve current leakage and 
gate capacitance of silicon oxide thin films 
[3]. 
Zirconium oxynitride is also a useful 
material which can be investigated by 
nitrogen doped into zirconium oxides or 
oxygen added into zirconium nitrides. They 
have decorative colorations which can be 
changed by different coating atmosphere and 
thickness [4-5]. They were also introduced 
with good corrosion behavior for 
applications of protective hard coating [6]. 
Furthermore, addition of nitrogen in 
zirconium oxide will enhance the optical 
properties and dielectric constant [7]. 
Among the stoichiometric zirconium 
oxynitrides, Zr2ON2 phase was first prepared 
by mixture of ZrO2 and Zr3N4 at 700℃ [8]. 
The structure and arrangements of Zr2ON2 
were discussed by Clarke. They suggested 
there was no preferring order between O and 
N anions [9], and the vacancy concentration 
could increase anion mobility in oxynitrides 
at high temperature. Bazhanov et al. [10] 
obtained two types of transition metal 
oxynitrides M2ON2 structure, which were 
cubic Bixbyite-type and hexagonal 
La2O3-type. They found the structure of 
Zr2ON2 may affect the energy band gap and 
the formation energy.  
With variable active gas flow rates, the 
variation of structure and mechanical 
properties are also worth studied. Different 
oxygen and nitrogen flow rate may influence 
the deposition rate and the thin films growth 
process [11].The decorative color and 
deposition rate of zirconium oxynitride thin 
films may vary by tuning the O/N flow rate 
during deposition [4-5] [12-14]. The bond 
fraction of covalent bond Zr-N and ionic 
bond Zr-O in thin films may also be affected 
by adjusting the different reactive gas flow 
rate. Therefore, the corresponding properties 
of thin films, such as mechanical and optical 
properties, may change accordingly [15]. 
Heat treatment is widely applied in 
industries. The annealing process not only 
changes the structure and properties of thin 
films, but also affects the stress relief and 
atom diffusion during the process. Besides, 
thermal stability of thin films is important 
that kept thin films with their main properties 
constantly at high temperature [16]. Under 
elevated annealing temperature, zirconium 
oxide and oxynitride thin films will introduce 
phase transformation and possibly changing 
mechanical properties. Different deposition 
processes before heat treatment also 
influence the properties of thin films. L. 
Cunha et al. [17] suggested the stress 
relaxation which is induced by heat treatment 
will decrease the disorder of crystallite and 
Before deposition, the substrates were 
bombarded by Ar ions for ten minutes with 
Ar (99.9995% in purity) flow rate of 56 sccm 
and the substrate bias was -250V. Then the 
hollow cathode electron gun was ignited 
under Ar flow rate of 156 sccm after the 
electron beam was lit up, the working gas 
was consisted of Ar and O2 (99.99% in purity) 
flow rate at 10.4 sccm and 10 sccm 
respectively. N2 flow rate was used to adjust 
O/N ratio ranging from 0.6, 0.8, 2.0, and 3.0 
during deposition. 
Results and Discussion 
 
3.1 Chemical composition  
The variation of Zr, O and N content 
with the O/N flow rate ratio is showed in 
Fig.1. The variation of oxygen and nitrogen 
content increases with increasing O/N flow 
rate ratio. During the deposition, the flow 
rate of oxygen is fixed while the flow rate of 
nitrogen is decreasing. In order to maintain 
the (N+O)/Zr to approach the values of 
m-ZrO2, which is the main structure in 
as-deposited series, the zirconium content 
slightly decreases.

3.2 Depth profile  
The depth profiles through thin films 
can be obtained by AES analysis. During 
deposition, the content of oxygen increases 
rapidly near the interface of thin films and 
substrate, which is defined as interfacial 
layer. The obvious oxygen interfacial layer 
of sample AD06 is showed in Fig.2. In 
HCD-IP system, zirconium ions also favor to 
react with oxygen than nitrogen. The uniform 
distribution after the oxygen interfacial 
interlayer is stable region during deposition. 
The interfacial thickness decreases 
from 229 to 136 nm with increasing O/N 
flow rate ratio, which is showed in Fig.3. The 
sample AD06 is in the high nitrogen content 
during deposition. At the beginning of 
deposition, oxygen may be more active to 
bond with zirconium. The reaction may take 
more time to reach the stable region, which 
may increase the interfacial layer thickness. 
With the decreasing nitrogen flow rate, the 
beginning of deposition is under higher 
oxygen content. The reaction may take 
shorter time to reach the stable region, and 
interfacial layer decreases.

this study is higher than the practical 
applications in the semiconductor industries, 
which is requested to be less than 100 nm. 
The improvement of thin film thickness and 
interlayer growth and the relation between 
nitrogen and dielectric constant may need 
further investigation.

3.5 Phase transformation and phase 
separation  
Before heat treatment, the m-ZrO2 is 
the main structure in all specimens, which is 
showed in Fig.6 (a). In this study, the oxygen 
content is higher than 30 %, the m-ZrO2 is 
the main structure showed in all the 
as-deposited specimens. After annealing, 
different phase transformation and phase 
separation observed by XRD and GIXRD 
patterns, which is displayed in Fig.6 (b), is to 
be discussed.  
3.5.1 Zone Ⅰ (m-ZrO2 Æ Zr2ON2) 
The O/N flow rate ratio is 0.6 and 0.8 
in zoneⅠ. After heat treatment, the major 
phase transformation is from the m-ZrO2 
phase in the as-deposited films to the only 
Zr2ON2 phase in the heat treated films. 
Zr2ON2 is the only phase in HT06 can be 
found in both XRD and GIXRD patterns in 
this zone, which is showed in Fig.7. The 
similar results can be obtained in sample 
HT08. Since zirconium ions in HCD-IP 
system is more favorable to bond with 
oxygen, m-ZrO2 structure may form first 
during deposition while nitrogen may stay at 
interstitial sites in the structure. The nitrogen 
content is higher than 20% in specimen 
AD06 and AD08. The m-ZrO2 structure 
accommodated with nitrogen defects may be 
unstable after deposition. Our previous study 
suggested that the Zr2ON2 structure is more 
stable than m-ZrO2 structure with nitrogen 
defects [28], and heat treatment may provide 
thermal energies for phase transformation. 
The Zr2ON2 phase may transform from 
m-ZrO2 with nitrogen defects.  
3.5.2 Zone Ⅱ  (m-ZrO2Æmixing of 
m-ZrO2 and Zr2ON2) 
With the increased O/N flow rate ratio 
to 2.0, the phase separation of m-ZrO2 and 
Zr2ON2 are observed in both XRD and 
GIXRD patterns. The increasing O/N flow 
rate ratio may lead to the formation of 
m-ZrO2 phase to be more kinetically 
favorable than Zr2ON2. The oxygen content 
may be sufficient to provide a portion of 
m-ZrO2 phase to be stable in the same 
structure after annealing, and a portion of 
m-ZrO2 may transform to Zr2ON2 phase with

Conclusions 
1. Thin films with m-ZrO2 phase have been 
deposited on P-type (100) wafer by 
hollow cathode discharge ion-plating 
(HCD-IP) system. 
2. After annealing, the phase changes with 
increasing O/N flow rate ratio. The phase 
transformed to Zr2ON2 with the O/N flow 
rate ratio is 0.6 and 0.8 in zone Ⅰ. The 
mixing phase of m-ZrO2 and Zr2ON2 
exhibits with O/N flow rate ratio at 2.0 in 
zone Ⅱ. The phase is remained m-ZrO2 
at O/N flow rate ratio at 3.0 in zone Ⅲ. 
3. The mechanical properties of Zr2ON2 are 
as following: the packing density is 5.78 
× 1022 atoms/cm3, the hardness is 16 GPa, 
and the optical residual stress is 0.45 
GPa. 
4. The obvious stress relief in thin films 
after annealing may be due to the 
reduction of defects. 
5. The dielectric constant of AD08 and 
AD30 is 7.1 and 14.9, respectively. The 
dielectric constant decreases with 
increasing nitrogen content.

中東主要產油國家由於宗教與政治問題，與西方先進工業國家時有衝

其影響範圍甚大，幾乎擴及各重要層面，如國防、工業、農業、石化、

能源問題廣受各國的重視。 
    各先進國家除了穩定油源與節約能源外，更投入大量人力物力進
