Abstract in English 
 
Within the framework of the present study, extensive two- and three-dimensional 
simulations of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and experimental 
measurements using PIV/BIV (particle/bubble image velocimitry) were performed in 
order to gain significant insight into various complex flow phenomena surrounding an 
artificial reef owing to its interaction with an oncoming wave. Nonlinear effects in the 
nearfield of the structures such as vortex formation, turbulence and wave breaking 
were intended to be investigated. In the numerical modeling, the transient evolution of 
the free-surface is opted to be captured by the higher order weighted essentially 
non-oscillatory schemes. Capillary effects is taken into account, so as to include 
concentrated nonisotropic stresses near the interface. Results concerning time 
evolutions of the velocity field were extracted for short waves, revealing how an 
initial steep wave undergoes breaking and successive splash-up cycles. Breaking 
processes, including overturning, splash-up and air entrainment, and breaking induced 
vortex-like motion and the associated energy dissipation were be investigated.

In the presently proposed experimental-numerical studies our interest is to 
investigate the turbulent characteristics surrounding an artificial reef and the 
associated wave breaking phenomena. Moreover, stability of artificial reef is very 
much dependent on the scouring at the toe. To estimate the sediment transport rate, 
accurate information on the local fluid velocity and turbulent intensity are also crucial. 
On the other hand, an accurate prediction of turbulence under breaking waves is still 
an ongoing and challenging research subject. While studying the interaction between 
breaking waves and a coastal structure, here we will be considering three different 
kinds of turbulence generation mechanism: (i) the turbulence due to wave breaking 
process as initiated by shoaling, (ii) the turbulence generation inside the boundary 
layer near the bottom of the artificial reef, and (iii) the turbulence generated by its 
porous nature. Notably, while small-scale turbulence inside a porous medium could 
be weak, turbulence could be significantly higher under breaking waves when the size 
of the artificial reef is relatively large. Moreover, it will be interesting to investigate 
turbulence physics (and generation/dissipation of energy) for different locations of 
wave breaking; for example, when wave directly collapse on the reef, and when 
waves breaks before they reach the coastline. On the other hand, over a narrow reef 
wave breaking is expected to take place in the form of overturning. We hope through 
our investigation we will be able to clearly display some of the physical phenomena 
that remain unclear associated with wave-reef interaction and breaking, and various 
dimensions/geometrical shapes of the artificial reef will be considered in order to 
extract detailed physics. 
 
On the other hand, very often horizontal vortices are generated under breaking 
waves (particularly in presence of an artificial reef); however, evidences of direct 
computations/measurements for the mean vorticity field under the breaking wave are 
very rare. Notably, vorticity transport exhibits a totally different feature from the 
turbulence transport. Vortices are usually generated at the weather side of the 
reef/breakwater as the wave propagates over it and there takes place strong 
wave/surface interaction. However, the position at which vortices are produced and 
their development varies as the relative amplitude increases, and they are generated as 
a consequence of flow separation owing to an adverse pressure gradient. Moreover, 
there appears very less scope of production or destruction of a significant amount of 
vorticity in the fluid region that may change the total amount of vorticity, and the 
diffusion and convection are the only two processes that could redistribute the 
vorticity. The mean vorticity is therefore expected to only be destroyed on the 
free-surface. In case of moderate interaction between the reef and the wave, usually 
vortices move up along the crest and eventually disappear at the top. However, in the 
 4
Moreover, breaking waves over artificial reef serve to restrict the height of the 
surface waves, and enhance air-sea fluxes of heat, mass and momentum through the 
generation of turbulence and air entrainment, and usually occurs due to intrinsic 
instabilities of water waves or interactions through wave-structure, wave-wave, 
wave-current and wind-wave. In addition, breaking waves exert the largest 
wave-induced force on offshore structures in heavy seas, which cause serious safety 
problems and structural damage. Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the 
mechanisms leading to the breaking processes. 
 
Breaking is characterized by “white water’’ falling down the front face of the 
wave. The plunging breakers (Bonmarin, 1989; Rapp and Melville, 1990) are 
characterized by a steepening and overturning of the front face and the formation of a 
jet that plunges into the water ahead of the wave. For the spilling breakers (see Banner 
and Meliville, 1976; Duncan, 1981) the wave shape as a whole remains more or less 
symmetric. Breaking is visible by the appearance of aerated water near the top of the 
wave, which subsequently spreads down over the front face. The distinction between 
plunging and spilling breakers refers to the phase of initial breaking. Farther inshore, 
both types gradually develop into a turbulent bore, of which properties are mainly 
controlled by the local depth. As these bores approach the waterline, they collapse, 
and the motion continues in the form of a thin sheet of water rushing up the slope to 
the point of maximum run-up, and then break again. 
 
Flow visualization shows that at large crest curvatures a toe is formed on the 
forward face of the wave. At higher curvature near the toe, the disturbance rapidly 
leads to the generation of parasitic capillaries, which grow and evolve into a turbulent 
spilling region on the forward face of the wave. Longuet-Higgins and Cleaver (1994) 
have found that the formation of the initial toe is similar to an inviscid irrotational 
instability of the highest wave. The large curvature at the tip of the toe along with free 
boundary conditions lead to the generation of vorticity associated with capillary 
waves. This vorticity is then transported into the surface layers and resonate with free 
surface modes (Longuet-Higgins, 1994). Laboratory measurements also suggest that 
the Benjamin-Feir instability generates dispersive sidebrand components that may 
lead to gentle breaking. On the other hand, laboratory experiments by Miller et al. 
(1991) suggest that the long-wave/short-wave interactions can lead to breaking. It is 
well known that waves propagating against an increasing current may steeper and 
break. Weissman et al. (1984) used high speed wave-gauge time series to detect 
breaking in lake experiments. Melville and Rapp (1988) conducted the LDV 
measurements of the horizontal velocity of the fluid at the surface to detect breaking.

2. Methods 
 
2-1 Experimental Method 
 
In recent years a modified version of the PIV method, called bubble image 
velocimetry (BIV) has been introduced by directly using bubbles as the tracer and 
measuring the bubble velocity by correlating the bubble images. The use of BIV is 
essential in this case due to the fact that in the vicinity of the artificial reef the flow is 
almost entirely bubbly flow after the wave breaking. Therefore, in our experiment we 
will be employing both PIV and BIV, depending on their suitability to extract the 
flow details. 
 
The experiments will be performed in a glass-walled wave tank located at the 
Department of Hydraulic and Ocean Engineering, National Cheng Kung University. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the wave tank is 25 m long, 0.5 m wide and 0.6 m high. Artificial 
reefs will be installed in the middle of the wave tank. The PIV technique will be first 
used to measure the velocity field near the artificial reefs without breaking wave. The 
light source of the PIV system is a dual-head frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser that 
has a 532 nm wavelength, 6 ns pulse duration and 10 Hz repetition rate for each head. 
The image recording device is a CCD camera from TSI Inc. with capacity 30 frames 
per second (fps) and a resolution of 1600×1200 pixels (Fig. 2 (a)). The seeding 
particles will have a nominal mean diameter of 8~12 μm and a specific weight of 
1.05~1.15. 
 
The BIV method will be used to obtain the velocity field while wave breaking is 
encountered. The method correlates the bubble images generated from the breaking 
waves. The images will be captured by a high speed camera mounted with focal lens. 
A 5 watt light emitting diode (LED) plate will be used to illuminate the flow more

2-1-2 BIV method 
 
The velocity field in the aerated region around the structure, which is the most 
interesting and important to the physical problem but difficult to measure using PIV, 
was measured by using the bubble image velocimetry (BIV) technique. The BIV 
technique is similar to PIV except it directly correlates the bubble images and does 
not require a laser light sheet for illumination. The BIV technique uses the bubbles as 
tracers and correlates the bubble texture in the aerated region. This means that the 
BIV technique works in the region where the PIV technique does not work. Fig. 5 
shows a sample of inverted BIV image captured from a breaking wave state. 
Since the BIV technique does not use a light sheet to illuminate a specific plane 
of interest like the traditional PIV method, it is necessary to know where the measured 
bubbles are in the cross-tank direction. The problem is solved by limiting the depth of 
field (DOF) in the experiment, achieved by carefully setting up the camera. The DOF 
is defined as the distance within which objects captured by the camera are well 
focused and appear to be sharp. The camera focal point and the DOF can be

2-2-1 Governing equations 
 
The Reynolds decomposition method is applied to simulate the turbulence effect 
of wave breaking and energy dissipation. The governing equations which describe the 
mean quantities of the flow field for unsteady incompressible turbulent flows are the 
Reynolds equations consisting of the continuity equation for incompressible flow and 
momentum equations on the x, y, z planes,

The coefficients nA and nmB in Eqs. (12) to (14) are determined based on the 
theory of Isobe et al. (1978), cn, sn, and dn are Jacobian elliptic functions, 
respectively. On the other hand, a radiation boundary condition proposed by Orlanski 
(1976) is also imposed at the downstream to let progressive waves outgoing without 
reflection. 
The boundary conditions on the solid surfaces including the bed and the 
undulation surfaces are assumed to be impermeable and non-slip, that is, the velocity 
components U and W are equal to zero at those boundaries. On the free surface 
boundary, one kinetic and two dynamic boundary conditions are used which are 
written in the form,

where the subscripts n and  denote the outward normal direction and two tangential

stress components specified by the flow on the free surface. 
 
2-2-3 Interface calculation 
 
Like other studies of free surface flows, we also encounter difficulties in treating 
the free surface boundary conditions of wave breaking on a sloping beach beach 
profile. Thus a suitable way of finding the free surface is of great importance in the 
numerical calculation. The piecewise linear interface calculation (PLIC) method 
presented by Gueyffier et al. (1999) which was developed on the basis of VOF  is 
adopted in this study to track the complicatedly and rapidly changing water surfaces 
during wave breaking. The VOF/PLIC is more precisely to treat the interface with 
Lagrangian advection of the interface pieces. In the numerical scheme, momentum 
 14
occupied by the solid phase. Details of the EB method are referred to Ravoux et al. 
(2003). An advantage of the EB method is that the computations are performed on a 
Cartesian grid without the need to fit the complex boundaries. 
 
2-2-4 Model validation 
 
Numerical simulations of breaking waves on a sloping beach and bar/step-type 
beach profiles are conducted to evaluate the performance of the present model. For 
the comparison with the other models, experimental data sets were used to compare 
with numerical results. Table 2 shows the numerical conditions for each case. 
 Fig. 6 shows the schematic view of the numerical wave channel for tested cases 
where the distance between x = 0m and the beginning of the varying bed is -0.7m and 
z = 0 is located around the toe of the bottom. Ting and Kirby (1994) performed 
experiments to investigate the evolution of a spilling breaker of Cn wave over a 
sloping bed. The incident wave height and period are H0 = 0.125m and wave period T 
= 2.0s in the constant water depth 0.4m for the spilling breaker as listed in Table 2. 
The time varying water surface elevations after wave breaking were measured at 4 
various locations (see Fig. 6) over the bed. In the numerical simulation, the 
computational domain is 20m long and 0.8m high. Fig. 7 shows comparison of the 
simulated and measured instantaneous water surface elevations from the shoaling 
region to the bore region. It is noted that the model results agree very well with the 
experimental measurements. In Fig. 7, we notice that the wave profiles present shorter 
and higher wave crests and longer and flatter wave troughs after wave breaking. In 
such condition, much wave energy has been released at the breaking point where 
wave height decreases.

with other’s results except for the values in the region x = 5~7m. In this case, the 
wave breaking region occurs between x = 6.5m and x = 7.5m and the bore region 
happens between x = 7.5m and x = 9.11m. The computed breaking point by the 
present model is located at xb = 6.1m, which is very close to the measured breaking 
point at xb = 6.4m. Notably the RNG model predicts the wave breaking far early than 
observed in the experiment, and also underestimates the wave crests in the surf zone. 
The computed breaking point by SGS model is at x = 7.5 m, which is very late 
compared to with the observed breaking point. The present model accurately predicts 
the wave height at the inner surf zone, while SGS model overestimates the wave crest 
near the breaking point and inside the surf zone. It is interesting to note that the mean 
water level is lower than the still water level before the wave breaking point x = 6.4m 
and arises gradually after the breaking point. These phenomena are known as wave 
setdown and setup due to variations of wave radiation stresses nearby the region of 
breaker line.

The phase averaged horizontal and vertical velocities are compared with 
laboratory measurements as shown in Fig. 9. At the region of the wave breaking x = 
7.275m and propagating bore region x = 9.11m comparisons are made at three 
different elevations below the trough level. The overall agreement between the 
numerical results and experimental data is reasonable. The numerical simulation of 
breaking waves by a k   model presented by Lin and Liu (1998) seems to show 
similar trends but overestimates the horizontal velocity at z = -0.1m. We note that the 
interface calculation techniques using VOF/PLIC and EB provide a more accurate 
prediction of wave profiles and particle velocities.

Numerical simulations of periodic waves propagating on a composite sloping 
bottom with bar or step configurations were carried out to evaluate the performance of 
the present model on wave recovery and again breaking and decay. Figs. 10 and 11 
show comparisons of simulated and measured surface elevations from the shoaling 
region to the bore region for the barred and stepped beach profiles. The beach profiles 
were made in the physical model test conducted by Nagayama (1983). It can be seen 
from Fig. 10 that waves breaking firstly takes place at the bar crest. At the 
post-breaking stage, the wave energy may recover followed by another occurrence of 
wave breaking due to the fact that the local water depth becomes deeper at the trough 
of the bar then decreases gradually shoreward. Nagayama (1983) measured the wave 
height variations on the bar/step-type beach profile as shown in the upper part of Figs. 
10 and 11. The wave conditions for these two laboratory experiments are listed in 
Table 2 as cases B and C, respectively. 
It is clearly seen that the recovery of wave energy takes place when the 
postbreaking waves propagate on the section with increasing or constant water depth. 
In Figs. 10 and 11, we note that the locations of first and second breaking points are 
well predicted in comparing with the experimental data for the barred profile, but are 
overestimated at the second breaking point for the stepped profile. In general, the 
present model results show good agreement with the measurements of wave height 
except that the numerical results shows slightly overestimate in the surf zone for case 
bottom

measurements extend well to the crest region and cover the entire surf zone with the 
mosaic of image frames. The result reveals that the velocities in the outer surf zone 
still nearly keep a distribution of a potential-like wave, while those in the inner surf 
zone are less uniform and asymmetric. During the spilling wave propagation, the 
wave height and flow velocities attenuate gradually. Experiment results show that the 
measured maximum velocity in the outer surf zone occurs at the head of the wave 
crest, the so-called roller region. The measured  velocity in this region is over 
1.25 C ,where C is the local phase speed and equals about 0.92 m s in the outer surf 
zone). 
 
Fig. 13 shows the distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy with color 
magnitude scale. Strong TKE densities are successively generated in the front face of 
the bore. The measured mean maximum value of TKE in the established bore region 
is 0.36C2 (t/T = 1/10). The turbulence continues to be generated during the bore 
propagation and is elongated to fill the whole wave crest. 
 
3-2 Numerical Results 
 
    In this section, we will present the results of numerical simulation results and 
provide some discussion on mean flow field and turbulent transport mechanism under 
wave breaking on a sloping bottom, the bar/step-type beach profiles using the present 
model. Interesting issues are the horizontal vortices formed in a breaking wave, 
turbulent kinetic intensity, turbulent dissipation and eddy viscosity.  
Four snapshots at different wave phases, i.e. t/T = 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75, are 
shown in the spatial domain to give a precise description of some characteristic 
phenomena in the breaking processes. Fig. 14 displays the spatial variations of the 
mean flow field. It is shown that the roller acts as the recirculating flow in the front of 
the turbulent bore. A jet is ejected from the crest of the breaking wave and impacts in 
the very upper part of the face of a wave. In the roller region, the horizontal fluid 
particle velocity is strong and roughly equal to the local phase velocity. As shown in 
Fig. 15, a vortex starts to form at the toe of the wave front right before wave breaking. 
This vortex is further strengthened and convected to almost the whole crest region.

The horizontal vorticity is normalized by /g h . 
 
 26
The snapshots of turbulent intensity are demonstrated in Fig. 16. Fig. 16 shows 
that the turbulent intensity is generated just before the breaking point and is higher in 
the roller region and forward face of the wave. Note that the turbulent intensity is then 
convected and diffused to the back face of the wave, remaining a considerable amount 
as the wave moves into the surf zone. 
 
The turbulent dissipation is presented in Fig. 17. Fig. 17 shows that the turbulent 
dissipation takes place above the wave trough and at the wavefront, with no turbulent 
dissipation under the wave crest. The turbulent dissipation displays a long tail at the 
back face of the wave when the wave approaches the shore. 
 
The eddy viscosity is an important parameter measuring the mixing rate of 
momentum. Fig. 18 demonstrates the spatial distribution of the eddy viscosity. The 
eddy viscosity has been normalized by the molecular viscosity. The eddy viscosity 
decreases with the shoaling of water depth after wave breaking. Since the eddy 
viscosity is proportional to the length scale and turbulent intensity, compared with the 
turbulent intensity, the eddy viscosity decreases faster in the surf zone. 
 
Fig. 19 demonstrates the sequence of spatial variations of particle velocities of 
the bar-type profile in a wave period. In Fig. 19, it is shown that the flow ejection is 
initiated at the breaking bar crest and then become flat to almost the bar though region, 
then the strong flow structure occurs at the second wave breaking. Fig. 20 presents the 
simulated mean velocity field for the stepped bar profile case. Comparing with results 
from the bar-type profile, we see that the flow structure of the stepped profile after 
wave breaking is uniform to almost the whole water body. 
 
We also look at the normalized horizontal vorticity defined by

In Fig. 21, it is noted that the major vorticity generated by the braking wave is located 
at the bar crest, this vortex is weaker and further convected to the region between x = 
3.5m and x = 5.2m. The substantial vorticity regenerated at the second breaking point 
associated the recovery wave crest. Fig. 22 illustrates the simulated horizontal 
voritcity in the stepped beach profile case. It is found that the vorticity is first 
generated at shallow water region and reaches its maximum value at the breaking 
point, finally covers a larger region in the surf zone.

4. Conclusions 
 
The flow field, turbulence and wave energy of spilling breakers over a step-type 
profile have been measured using PIV and BIV techniques. The advantage of the PIV 
method lies in its capability of measuring the instantaneous spatial distribution of the 
velocity field. The spilling wave breaker in front and on top of the step in the aerated 
region was obtained using the BIV measurement. 
 
The measured ensemble-averaged velocity fields and kinetic energy are 
presented. It is shown that the dynamic features outer surf zone still keep a 
distribution of a potential-like flow, but inside the surf zone are less uniform and 
asymmetric. Significant turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent Reynolds stress are 
produced by breaking waves in front of aerated region, then more offshore and decay. 
 
A three-dimensional turbulent model was developed to simulate spilling and 
plunging wave breaking in the surf zone by directly solving Reynolds averaged 
Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the continuity equation. The VOF with 
piecewise linear interface calculation (VOF/PLIC) which was developed to a second 
order accuracy is adopted to track the free surface configurations on a Cartesian grid. 
The bottom boundary condition is accounted for using the embedding method (EB) 
presented by Ravoux et al. (2003) in which the solid boundary is represented by 
adding a force to the flow phase in the computed cells that are fully or partially 
occupied by the solid phase. The advantage is that it is unnecessary to impose 
boundary conditions on the body surface. An explicit numerical algorithm is 
employed with a predictor-corrector procedure of pressure and velocity field. By 
applying the developed model to the problems of periodic waves breaking on a 
sloping bottom as well as bar/step-type beach profiles, we found that the model results 
compare very well with experimental data. The present model performs a better 
numerical result than that of Lin and Liu’s (1998) RANS model. Additionally, the 
model is demonstrated to provide reliable information concerning wave breaking and 
wave recovery on a bar-type and step-type beach profiles. 
 
We have presented a numerical model which can simulate spilling and plunging 
wave breaker in the surf zone. Characteristics for the spilling and plunging breaking 
wave in the surf zone on sloping and bar/steptype beach profiles were investigated by 
the numerical simulation. Although it is most successful on a sloping beach, it may 
also be employed to the cases where barred and stepped beach profiles are present. 
Detailed analysis of numerical results also showed that the turbulent intensity and
