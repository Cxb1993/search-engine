1. Photo-luminescence analysis 
The group Ⅲ-nitride wide band gap semiconductors 
have attracted much attention due to their applications 
in red/green/blue/UV light emitting diodes (LEDs) 
and laser diodes (LDs). Some commercial 
applications have included LED back-light for liquid 
crystal displays, traffic signals and indoor illumination. 
It has also been noted that multiple quantum well 
LED grown on silicon substrate has some advantages 
over that on sapphire substrate, such as lower cost, 
less hardness, and design flexibility in electronic 
circuits. In this paper, Ga (In)-Nitride multiple 
quantum wells have been successfully grown on high 
quality Si(111) substrate using metal-organic vapor 
phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The nanostructure and 
optical properties were carefully investigated and 
discussed. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) 
of GaN(0002) was about 600 arcsec from x-ray 
diffraction (XRD) rocking curves. The In-rich phase 
separation was studied by photo-luminescence (PL) 
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the 
20 K PL curves, the different emission peaks 
suggested the quantization effect and In-rich 
phenomenon in the multiple quantum wells. From our 
calculation, the polarization effects have caused the 
potential well Ew = -1×109 V/m and Eb = 1×108 V/m. 
 
1.1 Experimental methods 
The growth of the LED wafers was carried out in a 
low-pressure metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy 
(MOVPE) system with a horizontal reactor (Aixtron 
200/4 RF-S). Two-inch diameter silicon substrates 
with Si(111) plain orientation were used. 
Trimethylgallium (TMGa), trimethylaluminum 
(TMAl), trimethylindium (TMIn), and ammonia (NH3) 
were used as Ga, Al, In, and N sources, respectively. 
Monosilane (SiH4) and bis-cyclopentadienyl 
magnesium (CP2Mg) were used as n-type dopant and 
p-type dopant, respectively. A set of three samples 
were grown to study the influence of different 
quantum well pairs. The schematic illustration of 
InGaN MQW structure is shown in Fig.1.1. In the 
experiments, the MQW structure was designed to be 
three pairs (sample A), five pairs (sample B), and ten 
pairs (sample C). At first, a low temperature AlN 
nucleation layer was coated on the substrate. Si-doped 
AlGaN was then grown on AlN layer as a buffer layer 
at 720℃. The substrate temperature was raised to 
1080℃ and the Si-doped n-type GaN (0.5 μm) layer 
was grown on the buffer layer. After being grown 
nominally undoped InGaN/GaN MQW with well and 
barrier thickness of 1.5 nm and 16.4 nm, the substrate 
temperature was decreased and held at 700℃. Finally, 
the substrate temperature was raised to 950℃ and 
Mg-doped p-type GaN (0.3 μm) was grown. The 
structural properties of these samples were 
characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The 
structural profiles in the InGaN quantum well and 
GaN quantum barrier were defined using high 
resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
The optical properties of these samples were analyzed 
using photoluminescence (PL). The PL measurement

where Eg-GaN(0) = 3.4997 eV and Eg-InN(0) = 0.6502 
eV.  
From the above equations, the energy band gap value 
of In0.155Ga0.845N/GaN film was estimated at 2.5516 
eV. The corresponding wavelength 485 nm has been 
far more red-shifted than the peak positions listed in 
Table 1.1. This could be attributed to the particles 
confined in the nano-structure that produced some 
levels of strain to match the eigen-value of 
Schrödinger equation. From Fig. 1.4, the PL spectra 
for the In0.155Ga0.845N/GaN MQWs with different 
numbers in quantum well pairs were further analyzed. 
The peak position at 461 nm is the ground state and 
440 nm is the first excited state at the 20 K spectra. 
We calculated the ground state value to be 460.3 nm 
using the Schrödinger equation. From Fig. 1.3(c), 
there are three additional peaks at 485 nm, 504 nm, 
and 528 nm for sample C. These extra peaks are 
caused by In-rich phase separation. Because InN and 
GaN are far from being lattice-matched (11% 
difference in lattice constant), the low miscibility of 
these two compounds leads to large fluctuations in the 
indium content. It has appeared different indium 
composition with the original design (x = 0.155), such 
as x = 0.2444 to 0.6122. This suggested more indium 
atoms occupying gallium vacancies during the 
epitaxial deposition of the In0.155Ga0.845N film. The 
In-rich phase separation could produce InxGa1-xN 
(x>0.155) quantum dots. The carriers were also 
trapped from the alike quantum dots. The 
phenomenon would affect the optical properties and 
reduce the efficiency of electron-hole recombination 
rate. On the other hand, the integrated PL intensity 
data are shown in Fig. 1.6 for the three samples. It was 
evidenced that the integrated PL intensity of the 
InGaN/GaN MQW increased from 3 pairs to 5 pairs, 
because the number of carriers confined in the MQWs 
has been proportional to the number of MQW pairs. 
However, when the number of MQW pairs was more 
than five, such as ten, the integrated PL intensity 
became reduced dramatically due to the effect of 
In-rich alloy. Since the 5-pair MQW sample exhibited 
the highest intensity, the experimental PL data from 
Fig. 1.3(b) are compared with the simulated data for 
sample B in Fig. 1.7. The experimental data are more 
red-shifted than the simulation results between 20 K 
and 200 K. The quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE) 
was attributed to this condition.  
 
1.5 Polarization evaluation 
The compressive strain was accompanied by the 
growth of InGaN film on GaN matrix which in turn 
produced the piezoelectric filed. Table 1.2 provides 
some of the physical parameters of GaN, InN, and 
In0.155Ga0.845N for the evaluation in polarization. We 
could evaluate the strain transforming potential from:

2. Photonic crystal arrays 
The increase in light extraction efficiency has been 
encouraged by the incorporation of photonic crystal 
structures. In this study, photonic crystal array 
structures on p-type GaN of InGaN/GaN based 
light-emitting diodes were fabricated by 
photolithography and ICP dry etching processes. The 
blue light emitting diode wafers were grown by 
low-pressure metal organic chemical vapor deposition. 
The active InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells 
(MQW) were grown on 1.9 μm n-GaN layer. The 
Mg-doped p-type GaN was deposited on top of the 
active layer. The thickness of the p-GaN was about 
0.14 μm. Three pattern masks were then designed for 
patterning, including square lattice array, triangle 
lattice array, and honeycomb lattice array. After the 
patterned areas were pumped by the laser, the devices 
have exhibited enhanced photo-luminescence (PL) 
intensity at 438 nm. It has been attributed to the 
increased reflection by the lattice array structures, 
especially when the depth of the arrays was 100 nm. 
The analysis results showed that the improvement in 
the PL intensity with the square lattice array, triangle 
lattice array and honeycomb lattice array has been 
208%, 188%, and 90%. In addition, the square lattice 
array structure was demonstrated to have lower 
reflection coefficient of about 3-10% at incident angle 
of 0-20°. The temperature dependent PL was also 
discussed in the low temperature range. 
 
2.1 Experimental methods 
The growth of the blue LED wafers was carried out in 
Aixtron 200/4 RF-S. The thickness of n-GaN was 
about 1.9 μm. InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells 
were then grown to be the active layer of blue LED 
structure. The Mg-doped p-type GaN was grown 
afterwards. The thickness of p-GaN was about 0.14 
μm. Fig. 2.1 shows the schematic diagram of the blue 
LED structures. We used photolithography technology 
to fabricate micro-hoe array structure on the p-GaN 
layer. The three pattern masks included square lattice

lattice array (sample A) > honeycomb lattice array 
(sample C). Therefore, the illuminating area of the 
active layer for the honeycomb lattice array (sample C) 
is much larger than the square lattice array and the 
triangle array. This explained the higher PL 
improvement by the honeycomb lattice array sample. 
Nevertheless, all the three patterned samples have 
shown some enhancement in light extraction, while 
the un-patterned sample was supposed to have the 
largest illuminating InGaN/GaN active area. 
 
2.4 PL of lower etching depth array structures 
Fig. 2.5 shows the PL spectra of the surface-patterned 
square lattice array (sample D), triangle lattice array 
(sample E), honeycomb lattice array (sample F), and 
the un-patterned sample G at 300 K. The etching 
depth of the three patterned samples was lower at 
about 100 nm. This etching depth was sufficient to 
achieve the desired penetration near the MQW active 
layers of our structures. It was found that the PL 
intensity of the three patterned samples has been 
dramatically increased, and the increase was in the 
order of square lattice array (sample D) > triangle 
lattice array (sample E) > honeycomb lattice (sample 
F). The degree of enhancement in PL intensity has 
been 208%, 188%, and 90%, respectively. The 
increased photoluminescence intensity could be 
attributed to the efficiently decreased reflection 
between GaN and air, due to the patterned array 
structures. The incident light with angle higher than 
the critical angle might refract to air by the side wall 
of the etched holes. It not only introduces more laser 
light incident into the active layer to enhance 
photoluminescence intensity, but also transfers more 
light to air. The light intensity thus increases with the 
area of the etched side walls. This suggests higher 
light intensity enhancement with circle hole density. 
In accordance with this argument and the circle hole 
density, the light intensity would be in the order of 
triangle lattice array > square lattice array > 
honeycomb lattice array. However, the experimental 
results actually showed the order of light intensity in 
square lattice array > triangle lattice array > 
honeycomb lattice array. It has been suggested to be 
further influenced by optical interference. It provides 
the 438 nm main wavelength with constructive 
interference. On the other hand, the triangle lattice 
array exhibits two different symmetry directions. The 
T1 symmetry is similar to that of the square lattice 
array, and could provide less constructive interference 
in the triangle lattice array. Therefore optical 
interference might be beneficial for the enhancement 
in PL intensity of the square lattice array structure. 
 
2.5 Analysis of reflection coefficients 
From the PL analysis, we have found that the square 
lattice array with less etching depth to be most 
efficient in the enhancement of light extraction. It 
would be interesting to analyze the decreased 
reflection between GaN and air by electromagnetic 
wave using the square lattice array structure. Fig. 2.6 
displays the schematic diagram of the square lattice 
array model. The active layer is shown in region (I), 
where the permittivity is ε1. The region (II) is 
represented by air layer, where the permittivity is ε2. 
The region (III) is p-type GaN, where the permittivity 
is ε3. The surface structure is denoted by ζ(x). We 
assume the incident light to be p-polarized.

exhibits a much lower reflection coefficient. The 
reflection coefficient drops to about 3-10% while the 
incident angle is between 0° and 20°. When the 
incident angle approaches about 20°-25° critical angle, 
it can provide much total reflection condition for the 
incident light. 
 
2.6 Temperature dependent PL analysis  
The temperature dependent PL spectra of the 
patterned square lattice array structure (sample D) and 
the un-patterned wafer (sample G) are shown in Fig. 
2.8. In addition, Fig. 2.9 displays the tendency of PL 
intensity and the corresponding peak emission 
wavelength of the two samples versus temperature. 
From Fig. 2.9, it has been found the S-shaped 
temperature dependent emission shift condition. The 
PL intensity of the un-patterned wafer (sample G) 
decreased with increasing temperature. The carriers 
get much more energy of heat that can not be confined 
in MQW. However, the PL intensity of the patterned 
square lattice array structure (sample D) increased 
with temperature between 10 K and 200 K. When the 
temperature was above 200 K, the PL intensity began 
to decay. It was suggested that the square lattice array 
structure decreased the surface reflection and could 
transfer much laser light into GaN layer to excite 
more carriers to emit light. On the other hand, If we 
focus on the temperature range of 10-50 K, the PL 
intensity of the patterned square lattice array structure 
(sample D) is weaker than that of the un-patterned 
wafer (sample G), as shown in Fig. 2.10. It was 
attributed in part to the bond breaking due to dry 
etching of the side walls, which would catch some 
electrons.

centimeter per minute). Sample A was from 200 sccm, 
sample B was from 100 sccm, and sample C was from 
50 sccm. The LEDs were fabricated using 
photolithographic patterning, dry etching, and 
deposition of Ni–Au and Ti–Al as p- and n-type 
Ohmic contacts. The current–voltage (I–V) 
characteristics were measured at room temperature 
(RT) using Keithly power supply 2430, with the 
forward voltage from 0 to 5 V and the reverse voltage 
from -10 V to 0 V. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) 
characteristics were also measured at room 
temperature using Agilent 4294A (frequency at 100 
kHz) and Keithly power supply 2430. RT 
photoluminescence, RT electroluminescence (EL) at 
20 mA and the luminous intensity of these samples 
were measured as functions of forward injection 
current between 0 and 100 mA. RT-EL spectra and 
L-I curves were measured at room temperature (RT) 
using a Keithly power supply 2430 and a Keithly 
6485 power meter. Secondary-ion-mass spectrometry 
(SIMS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed 
to reveal the microstructures. The depth profiles of In 
and Mg were analyzed using Cameca IMS-4f. XRD 
was measured using PANalytical X’Pert PRO MRD. 
 
3.2 Electro-luminescence 
Blue LED structures that contain electron-blocking 
barriers grown at various Cp2Mg flow rates were 
prepared to investigate the doping efficiency. Fig. 3.1 
shows the EL spectra of the samples with the injection 
current of 20 mA at room temperature. The peak 
wavelength of these three samples has been around 
457 nm. The EL intensity of sample A was much 
higher than the other two samples. This was attributed 
to the increased hole injection in p-AlGaN during 
illumination. The higher Cp2Mg flow rate during the 
growth of AlGaN:Mg at 1050℃ thus could increase 
Mg diffusion into the MQW active region and 
improved EL efficiency. In addition, Fig. 3.2 describes 
the relative output luminous intensity as a function of 
injection current between 0 and 100 mA. Notably, the 
luminous intensity of sample A increased more than 
90% than those of sample B and sample C at an 
injection current of up to 100 mA. However, both the 
electron concentration in n-type and the hole 
concentration in p-type would contribute to the 
influence in luminous intensity. It is then interesting to 
estimate the electron concentration by calculating the 
donor concentration (Nd) using capacitance-voltage 
(C-V) characteristics. In Fig 3.3, we used 1/C2 versus 
the reverse voltage to calculate the donor 
concentration (Nd) by the following equation 
 
where C is the capacitance, q is the magnitude of 
electron charge (1.6×10-19 C), ε is permittivity, ε0 is 
permittivity of free space, Nd is the donor 
concentration, A is the area, Vbi is the built-in voltage 
and VR is the reverse voltage. It is evidenced that the 
Nd concentration has been in the range of 1.07-1.10 x 
1018 cm-3 for the three LED samples. Therefore, the 
dominant factor that influenced the luminous intensity 
would be the hole concentration from p-type structure. 
 
3.3 Secondary-ion-mass spectrometry  
Secondary-ion-mass spectrometry (SIMS) has been 
employed to reveal the Mg and In atomic 
concentrations near the MQW active region. Both the 
Mg depth profiles in GaN:Mg and AlGaN:Mg layers, 
and the In depth profiles in the MQW are shown in 
Fig. 3.4. The In concentration exhibited periodical 
profiles in the MQW region, indicating the thickness 
and composition of the QW structures as intended. 
The difference in Mg profiles from p-AlGaN to MQW 
active region suggested effective Mg diffusion into the 
active region for the high Cp2Mg flow rate sample.

form screw dislocation is the shear stress between 
atoms. And the mixed dislocation is the combination 
with edge dislocation and screw dislocation. The 
FWHM from GaN (0002) diffraction is usually more 
useful in observing the screw dislocation and the 
result from GaN (10ī2) diffraction could better 
identify the edge dislocation and mixed dislocation. It 
is therefore presumed that screw dislocation has been 
more easily to form than the edge dislocation and 
mixed dislocation. More Mg atoms have taken the 
lattice space of Ga in AlGaN to form screw 
dislocation. The damage or loss of structure and light 
intensity in edge dislocation and mixed dislocation is 
also much larger than that in screw dislocation. 
Therefore, the loss in luminescence intensity due to 
the contribution by screw dislocation density has been 
relatively less obvious in sample A. The higher hole 
injection and carrier concentration have played the 
dominant role in enhanced luminous intensity and 
reduced forward voltage.

temperature of 720oC. In addition, the GaN barrier 
layers of some samples were intentionally delta doped 
with SiH4 at a flow rate of 4 sccm. The substrate 
temperature was then elevated to 1150oC, and a 
0.21-um-thick p-type GaN layer were grown. The 
crystal qualities of these epitaxial layers were 
evaluated by temperature-dependent PL and high- 
resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD). A Philips 
MRD high resolution XRD instrument including a 
three-crystal monochromator was used for 
characterization. For the temperature-dependent PL 
measurements, the samples were mounted in a 
closed-cycle He cryostat and excited by a 
continuous-wave He-Cd laser, while the temperature 
gradually increased from 20 to 300 K. The average 
excitation intensity was 20 mW. The luminescence 
signal was dispersed through a 0.5-meter 
monochromator and later detected by a Si photodiode, 
during which a standard lock-in amplification 
technique was employed. 
 
4.2 Structural analysis 
Fig. 4.1 shows the HR-XRD ω-2θ scans for the (0002) 
reflection from the InGaN/GaN MQW samples with 
the doped and undoped barriers. The splitting between 
the diffraction peaks of the InGaN and the GaN are 
also shown, from which the heterstructures with Si 
delta doped barrier and undoped barrier can be 
qualitatively analyzed. The observed high-order 
satellite peaks emerging from the InGaN thin layer 
imply the In incorporation in the heterobarriers, while 
the main peak is (0002) from the thick GaN layer. 
Since the (0002) diffraction peak reflects the lattice 
constant in the growth direction only, larger splitting 
means higher In content for the samples. The x values 
of the InxGa1-xN/GaN MQWs for samples with Si 
delta doped barrier and undoped barrier are 0.148 and 
0.178 by Vegard’s rule, respectively. The sample with 
Si delta doping has been reduced in indium content. 
The broadened x-ray diffraction linewidths are also 
observed as the In composition in the MQWs further 
increased, indicating the crystalline randomization, 
the intermixing, and/or interface roughness in 
InGaN/GaN nanostructures. 
 
4.3 Photo-luminescence analysis 
Differences between heterostructures investigated are 
substantially reflected in PL spectra. In order to 
examine the In carrier diffusion process, the 
temperature dependent photoluminescence spectra 
were measured from 20 to 300 K. The emission peaks 
can be seen at 2.83 and 2.73 eV, with full width at 
half maximum (FWHM) for 135 and 119 meV, for 
samples with Si delta doped barrier and undoped 
barrier, at room temperature. It was observed in the Si 
delta doping structure with higher photon energy 
which could be attributed to the quantum-confinement 
effect and the reduction in dislocation density in the 
Si-doped GaN layer, while the broader FWHM was 
caused mainly by the In-rich InGaN crystallinity. 
Fig. 4.2 shows the evolution of photoluminescence 
emission peak energy for the InGaN/GaN MQW 
samples over a temperature range from 20 to 300 K. 
As can be seen, when the temperature was increased, 
the emission peak energy position of the InGaN/GaN 
MQW semiconductors exhibited the abnormal 
S-shaped curves (redshift-blueshift-redshift). It was 
found that InGaN/GaN MQW sample with Si delta 
doped barrier had higher In composition crystallites. 
Due to the carrier lifetime being prolonged by 
increasing temperature, we discovered that the PL 
peak energy values decreased when the temperature 
increased from 20 K to 100 K for both samples. By 
further increasing the temperature, the spectral 
blueshift occurred at temperature lower than the 
turning-point temperature, which is dominated by the

5. Electron tunneling layers 
InGaN/GaN quantum wells are being successfully 
used as the active region of blue and green light 
emitting diodes and injection lasers. Nevertheless, the 
epitaxil heterosystem exist misfit dislocation in 
nanocrystalline structures, which would led to the 
nonradiative recombination and decrease emission 
efficiency. In this article, we studied the unique 
correlations between the electrical and optical 
characteristics of the InGaN/GaN multiple quantum 
well (MQW) blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with 
n-AlGaN layer and n-InGaN/GaN superlattice 
electron tunneling layer (ETL) at a temperature range 
of 20 to 300 K by examinations of the ideality factors 
temperature evolution. It is found that the ideality 
factor of two devices increase with decreasing 
temperature from 300 K to 20 K. For these, we 
employ Levine’s model to characterize this anomaly 
and acquired the ideality factor as function of 
temperature is give by n=1+ To/T. The so-called 
pseudo-temperature To is a voltage-dependent 
parameter associated with the interfacial state 
distribution at heterojunction. The experimental 
evidences for electrical properties of two diodes 
exhibited the ideality factor extremely departure from 
unity, and the anomalies were characterized by 
pseudo-temperature To and carrier tunneling behavior.  
With respect to conventional n-AlGaN barrier devices, 
devices with ETLs inherently exhibit a large 
pseudo-temperature To with a large characteristic 
energy and charge population of the multilayer 
interface, over a variety of temperature and voltage 
ranges. Due to the more interface state distribution 
and the less effective density of state (DOS), the 
excitons formed in the ETL sample augment the 
spectral radiations at the temperature higher than 140 
K. Furthermore, the carrier tunneling processes via the 
extent of the charge population consequently cause
