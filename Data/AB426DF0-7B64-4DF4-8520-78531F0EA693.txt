1.2 Literature review
The earlier study of valveless pumping was closely related to the development of hemody-
namics. William Harvey was the ﬁrst physician to propose the concept of circulation theory
of blood ﬂow in 1628. In such a theory, the heart pumps the blood ﬂow in the circulation
system. However, as reviewed by Moser et al [2], some scholars doubted that the heart alone
could maintain the circulation of the whole body. From the contemporary study, we can
ﬁnd that there are many ways to evaluate the power of a human heart, but it is generally
agreed that the power is less than 5 watts in any situation [8]. Then in 1834, Weber suggested
that there may exist other mechanisms that help pump the blood ﬂow in the circulation sys-
tem [9]. Donders in 1856 proposed the concept of “respiratory pump”. The respiratory system
enhances the blood circulation eﬃciency by pumping the blood ﬂow in vena cava valvelessly
through periodic inspiration and expiration. However, this idea was debated for more than a
century [2,10,11]. In 1881, Ozanam also claimed that the arteries can cause valveless pumping
eﬀect on their companion veins [12]. A similar concept at the present time is muscle pump.
Contraction of skeletal muscles would be helpful to pump the blood ﬂow in veins back to the
heart. The valves in veins can also prevent backﬂow of blood [13].
Then, 70 years later, physician Gerhart Liebau in 1954 was the ﬁrst scientist to propose
a model of a valveless pumping mechanism [1], in which he demonstrated the generation
of a mean ﬂow in a valveless open-loop mechanical apparatus by periodically compressing
a plaint part of the apparatus. The aim of such a demonstration was to support the view

mechanism of human cardiovascular system. The faucet (W ) turned on and oﬀ to work as the heart,

the whole cylinder was immersed inside the water container ﬁlled with water to simulate as capillaries
(B), and porous linen (K) as ﬂow resistance between artery and capillaries. It can be observed that the
water could be pumped to elastic reservoir (H) located at higher level through the conduit (E) [14].
called the impedance deﬁned ﬂow or Liebau eﬀect. What should also be noted is the similar
mechanism in the cardiovascular system. The most obvious asymmetry structure of human
circulation is the location of the heart. It is always located at the left side of the vascular
system and this may have some connection with impedance deﬁned ﬂow. Some papers also
discussed other asymmetry contraction time course during heart perfusion, that is, the normal
cardiac cycle should always have a shorter systole phase and longer diastole phase to minimize
energy consumption [18,19]. Furthermore, the asymmetry of the heart chambers may also be
involved for the optimization of vascular system during blood mixing process [20].
Here we can note that Liebau’s work focused on the qualitative research but lacked of
ﬂuid-dynamic analysis. But his work then inspired a number of experiments and mathemati-
cal models for various valveless pumping systems. To give some quick ideas about such works,
a few of them are sketched below. For example, in 1963, Mahrenholtz [21] carried out experi-
6 1. Introduction
video by Beikzadeh et al. [29–31] on the Internet. Meanwhile, in 1983, Takagi and Saijo [32]
studied, both theoretically and experimentally, the performance of a valveless piston pump
under non-resonant conditions. In a follow-up work, Takagi and Takahashi [33] then modiﬁed
the piston pump conﬁguration and examined the eﬀects of resonance phenomenon on the
pumping characteristics.
In recent years, experimental studies and theoretical works continue to be devoted to un-
derstanding the many interesting characteristics of valveless pumping. For example, in 2003,
Ottesen [34] derived by averaging the Navier–Stokes equations a one-dimensional nonlinear
mathematical model for a ﬂuid-ﬁlled torus (like that originally described by Liebau [17]). The
mathematical model was then analyzed partly analytically and partly numerically, and the
theoretical ﬁndings were validated by some experiments carried out on a physical realization
of the torus system. In such experiments, a remarkable unidirectional mean ﬂow in the torus
was produced by compressing the soft tube at an asymmetric site with respect to the system’s
conﬁguration. It was also observed that the size and direction of the mean ﬂow depend on
the frequency and speciﬁc temporal form of the compression, the elasticity of the tubes, and
the compression ratio in a complicated manner. Babbs [35] also proposed a similar model like
Ottesen and discussed the viscous damping eﬀect in the wall of the valveless pump. For more
complicated 2-D model, Jung and Peskin also proposed a mathematical model and solved it
numerically by immersed boundary method [36].
Meanwhile, aiming to answer a number of important questions regarding the fundamental
mechanisms of valveless pumping, Hickerson et al. [37,38] carried out a comprehensive experi-
mental study using an impedance pump. The pump was constructed by connecting an elastic
tube to two water reservoirs; in some experiments, the two reservoirs were also connected by
an additional rigid tube to form a closed–loop system. The elastic tube was compressed by a
set of pinchers moving sinusoidally at a controllable frequency and ﬁxed nominal duty cycle
(i.e., the fraction of the pinching period during which the pinchers are separated by a distance
smaller than the resting diameter of the tube). Waves then are excited and propagate on the
tube. At the tube ends, the waves would partly reﬂect due to impedance mismatch, thereby
building up a mean pressure head that drives the ﬂuid ﬂow in the tube. Several distinguishing
features of impedance-driven ﬂows were then precisely identiﬁed, including that the net ﬂow
is highly sensitive to the pinching frequency. In particular, it was observed that an open-loop
8 1. Introduction
Broadly speaking, existing mathematical models of valveless pumping systems can be divided
into the following three categories: namely lumped-parameter models where the state of the
system is represented by a small number of lumped parameters (which, in turn, are gov-
erned by a set of coupled ordinary diﬀerential equations; see, for example, Refs. [2, 47–50]),
computational models that solve relevant ﬂuid and structural dynamics equations (e.g., Refs
[4, 27, 34, 51, 52]), and the wave-pulse model of Hickerson and Gharib [39] mentioned above.
Basically, lumped-parameter models are suitable for systems having a relatively low driving
frequency so that the eﬀects of wave propagation are subdominant, whereas the wave-pulse
model presumably would work well for systems driven at a relatively high frequency. Also, if
all the relevant physical factors are accounted for, computational models supposedly can be
used to simulate the system dynamics for a broad range of driving frequencies (but usually
at higher computational costs).
In existing models of valveless pumping, the interaction between the compression actuator
and the pliant part of the system in question has often been modeled in rather simple ways.
As a matter of fact, in some of the models cited above, the instantaneous deformation of
the pliant part of the system is prescribed in a manner not inconsistent (but not absolutely
consistent either, as we shall explain in Chap. 3) with the actuator motion (see, for example,
Ref. [34]), while in some other models the temporal variation of the external pressure at
the compression site is speciﬁed (e.g., Ref. [52]). Meanwhile, in the wave-pulse model of
Hickerson and Gharib, [39] a pair of pressure waves of a prescribed waveform are emitted from
the compression site at the driving frequency, and then travel in opposite directions. Under
suitable conditions, the aforementioned approaches have produced theoretical predictions that
can be satisfactorily veriﬁed by experiments. This suggests that, in such cases, the actuator
and the pliant part of the system may indeed interact in a rather simple way. This report is
intended as an investigation of the eﬀects of actuator impact of a valveless pumping system.
A ﬂuid–ﬁlled closed–loop system which consists of two distensible reservoirs connected by two
rigid tubes, which one of the reservoir is driven by the actuator. A lump–parameter model is
constructed to describe the system dynamics. Through asymptotic and numerical solutions,
we observe that actuator impact takes eﬀects on complicated nonlinear dynamical response
of the system. These results would be helpful to understand the fundamental mechanism of
valveless pumping.

dure [57]. Hoeben [58] also experimentally investigated impedance deﬁned ﬂow development
during CPR by constructing a ﬂuid–mechanical circulatory system.
For medical staﬀs, CPR is a tiresome procedure. In standard procedures, we should com-
press the chest about 100 times per minutes, and it may persist several minutes to accomplish
the procedure. Thus, in 1960’s, Dr. Clare Barkalow and his colleagues invented a mechanical
CPR assist device. This device can replace the physical work by linear motion mechanism
to compress the patient’s chest continuously. (for more understanding of this device, you
can see the video prepared by Jolife company [59].) Until now, the chest compression sys-
tem still similar to prototype design and have some technical defects, such as the ribs were
overloaded and may be broken by the device. How to improve the chest compression system
more eﬃciently and do less harm on human body becomes an important topic.
Recall the early work of valveless pumping experiment by Liebau and Moser [2], these
issues can be grouped in the same category because the similar mechanism–to pump the
system working ﬂuid by squeeze motion. It should also be noted that the eﬀects of actuator
impact discussed in this report and other papers published by our group [60,61] is similar to
the actuation motion of mechanical CPR assist device, it is reasonable to infer that our study
here will be useful and able to improve these techniques.

Furthermore, when the state of illness is in the worst case, the patients may need heart
transplant or VAD. VAD is a mechanical invasive device that is used to partially or completely
replace the function of a failing heart [70]. VAD are designed into three types: to assist
right(RVAD) or left ventricle(LVAD) or both(BiVAD) [70], but LVAD is the most common
case. In 1970’s, Texas Heart Institute began the study of LVDA design. In general, the

1.3.3 Varicose veins and its treatment
Recall the muscle pump discussed above. Healthy veins have one-way valves to control
the ﬂow direction of blood, that is, to make sure that the deoxygenated blood will ﬂow back
to the heart and preventing its backﬂow. However, for long-time standing or sitting workers,
the high hydrostatic blood pressure could cause damage on the venous valves and lead to
the occurrence of varicose veins. A brownish-blue shiny skin discoloration near the aﬀected
veins and the patients always feel painful, especially when standing or walking [76, 77]. The
symptoms of varicose veins are usually treated with surgery either to remove varicose veins
or to close them; and for non-surgical treatment, the patients can wear medical compression
stockings to alleviate the symptoms. Here we had an idea that, can we have an conceptual
design for a physical therapy instrument to treat varicose veins? Maybe it is possible to design
a electrotherapy instrument to stimulate the muscle contraction, or an active mechanism for
medical compression stockings, thus the blood ﬂow in veins can be pumped back to the heart.
The symptoms of varicose veins may be treated to some extent in this way. Clearly, in doing

So far, we have seen the importance of valveless pumping in biomedical engineering and
biological science. All these things make it clear that the mechanism of valveless pumping
is complicated, but the study of this topic is applicable in engineering and biological science
potentially.
1.4 Outline of this report
As can be concluded from the foregoing discussion, in the present work we shall demon-
strate that, in some cases, the collision of the compression actuator and the system’s pliant
part would be the only cause that produces a mean ﬂow in the system, and therefore deserves
more careful modeling.
To that end, a ﬂuid-ﬁlled closed-loop system proposed by Yang and Wang [60, 61] is
considered here, which consists of two distensible reservoirs connected by two rigid tubes,
with one of the reservoirs (hereafter referred to as the V0 reservoir) compressed by an actuator
at a prescribed frequency; see Fig. 2.1. It is assumed that the actuator motion speciﬁes the
upper bound of the instantaneous volume of the V0 reservoir. Moreover, during the whole

22 2. Basic Formulation
2.2 Mass conservation and momentum balance
Denoting the volumetric ﬂowrates (from the V0 reservoir to the V1 reservoir) inside the L-
and R-tubes by QL and QR, respectively, mass conservation requires that
V˙0 = −QL −QR, (2.4)
V˙1 = QL +QR, (2.5)
where the overdots represent derivatives of the state variables with respect to time t. Recall
that, when the system is in the contact mode, V0(t) = Va(t) is prescribed by Eq. (2.1);
Eq. (2.4) then requires the ﬂowrates QL and QR to vary consistently. On the other hand,
in the free mode Eq. (2.4) should be used in conjunction with other governing equations to
determine V0(t).
Again, in order not to introduce additional nonlinearities, we assume that the ﬂow resis-
tance coeﬃcients are constant, i.e., the pressure drop to the ﬂuid ﬂow in each tube is assumed
to be linearly proportional to the volumetric ﬂowrate therein. Likewise, the inertia of the ﬂuid
in each tube is taken to be constant too. The momentum equations for the L- and R-tubes
therefore are
ILQ˙L +RLQL = p0 − p1, (2.6)
IRQ˙R +RRQR = p0 − p1, (2.7)
since the tubes are assumed to be rigid, RL,R and IL,R are the constant resistance and
inertia coeﬃcients, respectively. It can be readily deduced from Eq. (2.6) that, if the L-tube
stands alone (i.e., not connected to the system), the intrinsic time scale for the variation of
QL is TL = IL/RL. Similarly, the intrinsic time scale for QR variation when the R-tube
stands alone is TR = IR/RR. So far we have introduced 7 state variables (namely V0,1,
p0,1, pe, and QL,R) and 11 input parameters (ω, Vmax, Vmax, V0f , V1f , C0,1, IL,R, RL,R)
of the model system. As non-dimensionalization of the above mathematical formulation
does not signiﬁcantly reduce the number of variables and parameters (by three at most,
since three independent physical dimensions—namely mass, time, and length—appear in the
formulation), here we shall proceed with the dimensional formulation. However, in the sequel,

and the same skin thickness of h = 5 mm. The free volumes of the two reservoirs therefore
are V0f = 65.4 ml and V1f = 523.6 ml, respectively. Meanwhile, despite that relatively large
volume changes will be allowed in our numerical calculations, the compliance coeﬃcients of
the two reservoirs are estimated by that of thin-walled spherical shells having mean radii
a0,1 and undergoing small volume changes, namely C0,1 = 2pia40,1/Eh. This somewhat crude
approximation yields C0 = 2.45 × 10−4 ml/Pa and C1 = 3.93 × 10−3 ml/Pa.(We have also

coeﬃcients, and the results are only about 20% smaller than that listed above. So, the values
of C0,1 speciﬁed above indeed are reasonable estimates of the compliance coeﬃcients. And
of course, more accurate estimates of the parameter values may be needed if one wishes to
compare the model predictions with relevant experimental data in future works.)
Suppose also that the L- and R-tubes have the same length lL = lR = 200 mm, but
diﬀering inner radii, aL = 5 mm and aR = 7.5 mm. Water at room temperature, with
density ρ = 1000 kg/m3 and viscosity µ = 0.00112 Pa·sec, is taken to be the working ﬂuid
in the system. Using the Poiseulle’s law, the ﬂow resistance coeﬃcients RL,R appearing in

by Eq. (2.8), this result gives
(IL + IR) Q˙L + (RL +RR)QL = −RR · V˙a − IR · V¨a
= ∆Va · (ωRR sinωt+ ω2IR cosωt). (3.1)
Given a suitable initial value of QL, one can solve Eq. (3.1) analytically for QL(t), and then
calculate all the other state variables accordingly using Eqs. (2.2)–(2.7). Equation (3.1) also
indicates that, when the L- and R-tubes are connected with the V0 and V1 reservoirs, the
intrinsic time scale for the ﬂowrate variation in the closed loop is TLR = (IL+IR)/(RL+RR),
which generally is diﬀerent from the time scales TL = IL/RL and TR = IR/RR for stand-alone
tubes. The sample parameter values speciﬁed in Sect. 2.4 give TL = 2.79 sec, TR = 6.28 sec,
and TLR = 3.37 sec.
Assume now that the system has a steady periodic response completely in the contact
mode. Accordingly, one may write
QL(t)
ω∆Va
= A cosωt+B sinωt, (3.2)
where the coeﬃcients A and B can be readily determined by substituting Eq. (3.2) into
Eq. (3.1) and then comparing coeﬃcients of the sine and cosine functions in the resulting
expression. This yields
A =
RLR
RL
· ω(TR − TLR)
1 + ω2T 2LR
, B =
RLR
RL
· 1 + ω
2TRTLR
1 + ω2T 2LR
,
with RLR, given by 1/RLR = 1/RL + 1/RR, being the overall resistance coeﬃcient when the
L- and R-tubes are connected in parallel. It then transpires that, if the system is completely
in the contact mode—and hence is perfectly linear, no pumping eﬀects are produced on
average. This also points to the fact that asymmetry alone is not suﬃcient for producing a
mean ﬂow in a valveless pumping system; certain nonlinearities of the system also are needed
(i.e., a perfectly linear valveless pumping system excited sinusoidally at an asymmetric site
still produces no mean ﬂow).
30 3. Mode Switching and Jump Conditions
ω = ωth—at which S20 = S21 +S22—is of O(ϵ−1). Accordingly, ωTLR, ωTL and ωTR are O(ϵ−1)
quantities, and the expressions for S1,2 derived above simplify to S1 = 1− (ϵω)2TLTR+O(ϵ2)
and S2 = O(ϵ). One may then approximate the aforementioned admissibility condition by
S20 ≥ [1 − (ϵω)2TLTR]2 to leading order, and deduce that the system has a steady periodic
response completely in the contact mode only when ω < ωth, with
ωth ∼ ϵ−1
(
1 + S0
TLTR
)1/2
(3.5)
for ϵ → 0+. As will be shown in Chap. 4, Eq. (3.5) gives an accurate estimate for ωth,
provided that the dimensionless compliance parameter ϵ is suﬃciently small.
3.3 Separation of the V0 reservoir from the actuator
As shown in Sect. 3.2, while the system is pre-compressed, as time goes on the external
pressure of the V0 reservoir, pe given by Eq. (3.4), may decrease to zero, say, at t = Ts. The V0
reservoir then separates from the actuator, and the system switches from the contact mode
to the free mode. After t = Ts, the volume of the V0 reservoir varies freely (i.e., without
forcing), and we set pe = 0. Accordingly, Eqs. (2.2) and (2.3) give p0(t) = −[V0f − V0(t)]/C0,
p1(t) = [V0f − V0(t)]/C1, and so in the free mode
p0(t)− p1(t) = −[V0f − V0(t)]/C01 < 0. (3.6)
This implies that, when the system is in the free mode, the diﬀerence in the reservoir pressures
tends to drive the working ﬂuid from the V1 reservoir to the V0 reservoir. (Due to inertial
eﬀects, however, the ﬂowrates QL,R still may be positive.) Note also that all of the state
variables vary continuously at t = Ts, and the only discontinuity occurs in p˙e, which “jumps”
from a ﬁnite negative value at t = T−s to zero at t = T+s .
3.4 Blocking of the ﬂuid loop
Now, when the system is in the free mode, V0(t) may decrease to zero. (Note that this
would not happen for V1(t), because then we would have V0 = V0f +V1f > Vmax; but Vmax is
the maximum value of V0(t) for ∀t > 0.) When the V0 reservoir is completely depleted, say,
32 3. Mode Switching and Jump Conditions
where the “characteristic inertia” ILR of the system is deﬁned by 1/ILR = 1/IL+1/IR. It then
transpires that the magnitude of the impulse and the resulting ﬂowrate jumps are directly
proportional to the decrease in V˙0; see Eq. (3.8).
3.6 Mode switching at the reservoir–actuator collision
After the collision at t = Tc, the V0 reservoir may stay in contact with the actuator (and
the system switches to the contact mode), or simply rebound (so that the system stays in the
free mode). To decide what would happen, ﬁrst we assume that the V0 reservoir rebounds,
so that pe(T+c ) = 0 and hence p0(T+c ) = −[V0f − Va(Tc)]/C0, p1(T+c ) = [V0f − Va(Tc)]/C1
(see Sect. 3.3). Of course, one would also have QL(T+c ) and QR(T+c ) given by Eqs. (3.9)
and (3.10), in addition to V0(T+c ) = Va(Tc) and V1(T+c ) = V0f + V1f − Va(Tc). If these state
conditions render V0 < Va right after t = Tc, it is interpreted that the V0 reservoir just has to
rebound. On the other hand, if V0 > Va subsequently (which is inadmissible), the V0 reservoir
stays in contact with the actuator, and the system is switched to the contact mode.
3.7 Numerical method
Fig. 3.1 summarizes the decision rules discussed above. Such rules can be readily inte-
grated with the numerical procedures for solving Eqs. (2.2)–(2.7). Brieﬂy, with the initial
conditions speciﬁed in Sect. 2.3, the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is used to integrate
Eqs. (2.2)–(2.7). At each time step, the decision rules are applied to check if any mode switch-
ing occurs, and, if necessary, reset the values of the system’s state variables. In general, the
computation is terminated when a steady state of the system is reached. In our computations,
when the relative variations of all the system state variables after a complete compression pe-
riod are less than 10−13 (or 10−11%), which in fact is a rather stringent criterion, it is decided
that a steady state is established. Generally speaking, it takes a few dozen compression cycles
for the system to reach steady periodic responses with complete depletion of the V0 reservoir,
while a few hundred compression cycles may be needed for steady periodic responses without
complete depletion of the V0 reservoir. Care is also taken to ensure that the time step is
suﬃciently small to adequately resolve the system dynamics. Typically, the number of time
steps in a complete compression cycle is on the order of 103–104. The numerical results will

balance analysis reveals that the time scale is of O(1/ϵ). [81] The same conclusion applies for
QR(t) and [V0(t) − V0f ] as well. One may then introduce the fast temporal variable τ = t/ϵ
and transform Eq. (4.2) into

where the primes denote diﬀerentiations with respect to τ , i.e., (·)′ = d(·)/dτ .
The leading-order approximation of Eq. (4.3) for ϵ→ 0+ is
Q′′′L +Q

L/TLTR = 0, (4.4)
which has the general solution QL(τ) = C1+C2 cos(τ/
√
TLTR)+C3 sin(τ/
√
TLTR). However,
Eq. (4.4) is a valid approximation of Eq. (4.3) only for fast varying QL, and hence the constant
solution must be discarded. Accordingly, for ϵ→ 0+, we have

Note also that some extra factors are introduced in the coeﬃcient of Eq. (4.5) for some
convenience in subsequent algebra. Similarly, we have for ϵ→ 0+

with undetermined (as yet) amplitude factors CR,V and phase constants φR,V . Now, with
Eqs. (3.6) and (4.5)–(4.7), balancing the leading-order, namely O(1/ϵ2), terms in Eqs. (2.6)
and (2.7) requires that

undetermined as yet.
To determine θ, φ, and C, note ﬁrst that V0(t1,2) = Va(t1,2). With Eqs. (2.8) and (4.7),
this implies that −C cosα/ILR = −γV0f −∆Va(1− cos θ); hence we have
cos θ = S0 − C cosα
ILR∆Va
. (4.11)
Next, using Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6), the jumps in the ﬂowrates QL and QR upon a collision are
calculated as follows: QL(t+1 ) −QL(t−1 ) = QL(t1) − QL(t2) ∼ 2C sinα/ϵIL
√
TLTR; similarly,
QR(t
+
1 ) − QR(t−1 ) ∼ 2C sinα/ϵIR
√
TLTR. These results are consistent with Eq. (3.8), which
also gives the impulse of the collision at t = t1: I ∼ 2C sinα/ϵ
√
TLTR (> 0). Meanwhile,
Eq. (3.11) gives I = ILR[V˙0(t−1 ) − V˙a(t1)] = ILR[V˙0(t2) − V˙a(t1)] ∼ ϵ−1(C sinα/
√
TLTR +
ω˜ILR∆Va sin θ). Equating the above two equivalent results then yields
sin θ = C sinα
ω˜ILR∆Va
√
TLTR
=
Cα sinα
piILR∆Va
, (4.12)
where the last equality is obtained by use of Eq. (4.10). Moreover, as explained in Sect. 4.4,
to ascertain that the collision at t = t1 does not switch the system to the contact mode, V0(t)
must decrease faster than Va(t) does at t = t+1 . Since V˙0 = V˙a after collision (see Sect. 4.3),
this implies that V¨0(t+1 )− V¨a(t1) < 0. Using Eqs. (4.7), (4.10) and (4.11), it is calculated that
V¨0(t
+
1 )− V¨a(t1) ∼ ϵ−2ω˜2∆Va[S0 − (1− α2/pi2)(C/ILR∆Va) cosα]; hence it is required that
C
ILR∆Va
≥ S0
(1− α2/pi2) cosα. (4.13)
Now, making use of the basic trigonometric identity that sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1, it is derived
from Eqs. (4.11) and (4.12) that

One root of the above algebraic equation clearly violates the separation condition given by
Eq. (4.13), and the only possibly admissible root is written as follows:

Figure 4.1: The threshold frequency ωth for the onset of free-mode responses, and the critical
frequencies ωcr and ωst between which steady periodic purely-free responses stably exist. The curves
are the asymptotic results, and the overlapping symbols are the corresponding numerical results. (The
four numerical data of ωst for Vmin/Vmax < 0.34 also are connected by a curve for clarity.)
values (by the characteristic frequency ϵ−1(TLTR)−1/2) of ωth are shown in Fig. 4.1. Also,
while Eq. (3.5) predicts that the leading-order approximation of the normalized threshold
frequency, ϵωth
√
TLTR, depends on the ratio of γ/δ only, here the more straightforward (from
a practical standpoint) volume ratio Vmin/Vmax = (1− γ− 2δ)/(1− γ) is used as the abscissa
in Fig. 4.1. It is clearly seen that, given the extremely small value of ϵ2 = 1.03× 10−5 here,
the numerical and asymptotic results are in excellent agreement.
Moreover, the critical frequency beyond which the purely-free system responses arise,
i.e., ωcr deﬁned by Eq. (4.16), and the parameter boundary for such responses to have a
non-negative V0(t), speciﬁed by Eq. (4.17) with γm = 0, are shown as the short-dashed and
dot-dashed curves in Fig. 4.1, respectively. It is important to note that the ωcr curve intersects
the γm = 0 curve at about Vmin/Vmax = 0.30 (with ϵωth
√
TLTR = 3.7) and terminates there,
since Eq. (4.16) is valid only when V0(t) is non-negative. Again, the asymptotic and numerical
results of ωcr agree extremely well. Other curves in Fig. 4.1 will be explained later.
42 4. Steady Periodic Purely-Free System Response
Since only small collision phase deviations are considered here, there is no need to impose
an additional condition for the separation of the V0 reservoir from the compression actuator.
Similarly, at the next collision, a volume matching condition analogous to Eq. (4.18) can be
written down and then linearized. Using also Eqs. (4.20) and (4.21), the result is reduced to

= sin θ cos 2α+ pi

Substituting Eq. (4.14) into the above result, one then deduces (with some algebra) that
the stability condition |δa2/δa1| ≤ 1 implies that[

≤ (1− α
2/pi2) cos2 α+ α2/pi2
(1− α2/pi2) cos2 α− α2/pi2 . (4.22)
With the separation condition, Eq. (4.15), it can be shown that the left-hand side of Eq. (4.22)
is positive and decreases monotonically with α (from an inﬁnitely large value at α = 0), while
the right-hand side increases monotonically with α (from unity at α = 0). So, for the steady
periodic purely-free response to be stable, the phase parameter α must exceed a certain
critical value, denoted below by αst, which can be determined numerically from the equality
in Eq. (4.22). In terms of the driving frequency ω of the system, this implies that such
responses are stable when
ω ≤ pi/αst
ϵ
√
TLTR
≡ ωst. (4.23)
Again, with the same parameter values speciﬁed in Sect. 2.4 and the pre-compression
ratio γ = 0.4, the stability-margin frequency ωst calculated from Eq. (4.22) is shown as
the long-dashed curve in Fig. 4.1. The ωst curve intersects the γm = 0 curve at about
Vmin/Vmax = 0.31 (with ϵωst
√
TLTR = 4.2) and terminates there, since in deriving Eq. (4.22)
a non-negative V0(t) is assumed. As shown in Fig. 4.1, when the volume ratio Vmin/Vmax
exceeds about 0.34 (at which ϵωst
√
TLTR = 4.2 and γm ≈ 0.02), the numerical results (indi-
cated by the overlapping symbols) agree well with the asymptotic results of ωst. However,
when the Vmin/Vmax ratio is decreased below 0.34 (but still greater than the limiting value
0.31), a sudden increase in ωst is observed in the numerical results.
It must be noted here that we never discuss the cases when non-negative V0(t) assumption
is failed. The high non–linearity is produced under this condition and it oﬀers the important

Figure 5.2: For γ = 0.4 and Vmin/Vmax smaller than about 0.34, when the driving frequency exceeds
a critical value ωv0—plotted here for various Vmin/Vmax ratios—the V0 reservoir would be completely
depleted at a certain phase of the compression cycle. Some results in Fig. 4.1 are duplicated here for
reference.
As a demonstration, let us take Vmin/Vmax = 0.33 (corresponding to line II in Figs. 4.1
and 5.2). For this case, the asymptotic results give ϵωth
√
TLTR = 2.00 (or fth = 23.7 Hz),
ϵωcr
√
TLTR = 3.72 (fcr = 44.1 Hz), and ϵωst
√
TLTR = 4.18 (fst = 49.4 Hz). Meanwhile,
it is determined numerically that ϵωv0
√
TLTR = 3.97 (fv0 = ωv0/2pi = 47.0 Hz). When the
system is driven at the frequency f = 48 Hz, which is higher than both fcr and fv0 and lower
than fst, two diﬀerent system responses indeed are found in the steady state, and are both
shown in Fig. 5.3(a). In one of them, the V0 reservoir has a positive volume throughout
the compression cycle, and the numerically calculated response is visually indistinguishable
from the asymptotic solution given by Eq. (4.7) (not shown in Fig. 5.3(a)). In the other
response, the V0 reservoir is completely depleted at a particular compression phase. Since
in such a response V˙0(t) has a non-zero (negative) value when V0(t) vanishes, it will be
referred to as the “hard-landing” response in the sequel. Note also that both of the coexisting
responses shown in Fig. 5.3(a) are purely-free, and are sustained by a collision of the V0
reservoir with the actuator in each compression cycle. However, to ﬁnd the purely-free steady
50 5. Further Numerical Results and Discussion
periodic system responses having a positive deﬁnite V0(t) (or, the “never-landing” responses),
the initial conditions of the system need to be carefully tuned. When the arbitrary initial
conditions speciﬁed in Sect. 2.3 are used, we generally ﬁnd the hard-landing purely-free
responses instead. This seems to suggest that the hard-landing responses are more stable
than the never-landing ones, in the sense that certain accidental depletions of the V0 reservoir
accompanying the initial transient would cause the system to respond in the hard-landing
way.
Note also that, for driving frequencies f < fv0 (but exceeding fcr), only the purely-
free never-landing responses are found. Meanwhile, for values of f that are slightly higher
than the stability-margin frequency fst predicted by the asymptotic theory, only the hard-
landing purely-free responses are found. However, as indicated in Fig. 5.2, if f is further
increased, the hard-landing purely-free responses also will become unstable. In particular,
for Vmin/Vmax = 0.33, this higher stability-margin frequency is about 65 Hz (see Fig. 5.2).
Taking then f = 70 Hz as an example, the resulting system response in shown in Fig. 5.3(b).
It is interesting to note that the response appears to repeat itself every six compression cycles.
However, as mentioned above, tracing the detailed transition of the simple periodic responses
to other more complex responses is beyond the scope of this report. Now, for even smaller
volume ratios, i.e., Vmin/Vmax < 0.31, Fig. 5.2 indicates that the never-landing purely-free
system responses would cease to exist. In such cases, the only useful asymptotic result is
the still accurate estimate of the threshold frequency ωth for the onset of free-mode system
responses. Here we shall take Vmin/Vmax = 0.15 as a particular example, corresponding to
line III in Figs. 4.1 and 5.2. For this parameter combination, it is determined numerically
that fv0 is 33.1 Hz (or ϵωv0
√
TLTR = 2.80) and fst = 128 Hz (ϵωv0
√
TLTR = 10.8); see Fig.
4.1. Also, the asymptotic theory predicts that fth = 22.4 Hz (ϵωth
√
TLTR = 1.89). Moreover,
it is found that, for f ∈ (fth, fv0) (say, f = 28 Hz; see Fig. 5.4(a) for the resulting system
response), the V0 reservoir would separate from the compression actuator for some part of the
compression cycle, and its volume during that part would be positive. Meanwhile, when f
slightly exceeds fv0, the V0 reservoir still would be in contact with the compression actuator
for some part of the compression cycle, but would be completely depleted during the free mode
of the system response; see Fig. 5.4(a) for an example with f = 50 Hz. When the driving
frequency is further increased (beyond a critical frequency fcr of about 71 Hz), however, the
52 5. Further Numerical Results and Discussion
system response becomes purely-free, and the V0 reservoir would be completely depleted at
a certain phase of the compression cycle. An example with f = 100 Hz is also shown in Fig.
5.4(a). Finally, when f > fst (say, f = 130 Hz; see Fig. 7(b)), steady periodic responses
repeating themselves in one compression cycle no longer can be found. While the response
shown in Fig. 5.4(b) also appears to repeat itself every six compression cycles, more complex
system responses would result from rather small variations of the driving frequency, which
will not be discussed here.
5.2 Demarcation of system response
Let us now discuss the numerical results of our impact dynamics model for a model
valveless pumping system having the parameter values speciﬁed above. First, Fig. 5.5 shows
the parameter boundaries for various types of system responses observed in our computations.
Basically, in the parameter range shown in Fig. 5.5, when the driving frequency ω of the
actuator does not exceed the “stability-margin frequency” ωst , ﬁve diﬀerent types of
system responses are observed, namely the “purely–contact”(labeled by abbreviation PC
in Fig. 5.5), “contact–free”(CF), “purely–free”(PF), “contact–free with V0 reservoir
depletion”(CF0), and “purely–free with V0 reservoir depletion”(PF0) responses.
The PC responses exist when ω is below the threshold frequency ωth, in which the V0
reservoir never separates from the actuator and no mean ﬂowrate is produced in the ﬂuid
loop. When the volume ratio Vmin/Vmax is larger, the CF responses arise when ω exceeds
ωth but is lower than the onset frequency ωPF of the PF responses. In the CF responses, the
system is in the contact mode for a certain portion of the compression cycle, and is in the
free mode for the rest of the compression cycle; see Fig. 5.6(a) for an example. Meanwhile,
in the PF responses, the V0 reservoir collides with the actuator at a particular phase of the
compression cycle and separates from the actuator right afterwards; see Fig. 5.6(b). If ω
is further increased beyond the stability-margin frequency ωst , the system responses then
become much more complicated, and will be discussed later.
For smaller values of the ratio, when ω exceeds ωth , the V0 reservoir also would separate
from the actuator during some portion of the compression cycle, so that the CF responses
would arise. However, beyond a certain critical driving frequency ωCF0 , the V0 reservoir would
be completely depleted at a certain phase in the free-mode portion of the CF responses. Such

both QL and QR to zero), so that the V0 reservoir would collide with the actuator earlier
than it would when negative values of V0(t) were allowed. This results in the small increase
of the actual duty cycle when ω slightly exceeds ωv0 (followed by further decrease of the duty
cycle for even higher driving frequencies). Meanwhile, the curves in Fig. 5.8 suggest that
the frequency dependence of the actual duty cycle for diﬀerent Vmin/Vmax ratios is somewhat
similarity—with ωˆ being the similarity parameter—as long as the V0 reservoir has a positive
volume throughout the compression cycle.
Next we discuss the frequency dependence of the mean volumetric ﬂowrate in the L-tube,
which is calculated by averaging QL(t) over one compression period: 〈QL〉 =

with T = 2pi/ω. (By mass conservation, 〈QR〉 = −〈QL〉 in the steady state; there therefore
is no need to discuss 〈QR〉 separately.) After being normalized by the characteristic scale
∆Va/TLR, the calculated results of 〈QL〉 for cases I, II, and III are plotted as functions of the
normalized driving-frequency parameter ω∗ = (ω − ωth)/(ωst − ωth) in Fig. 5.9(a). Unlike
in Fig. 5.8, here we present the results for driving frequencies ω up to the stability-margin
frequencies ωst in the three case. Also, since the mean ﬂowrate 〈QL〉 may change sign as ω
varies, shown in Fig. 5.9(a) is the absolute value of 〈QL〉.
Let us discuss the frequency dependence of 〈QL〉 in case I (with Vmin/Vmax = 0.6) ﬁrst;
see the solid curve Fig. 5.9(a). Note that in case I the mean ﬂowrate 〈QL〉 is positive (i.e.,
there is a mean ﬂow in the L-tube from the V0 reservoir to the V1 reservoir) when the driving
frequency ω slightly exceeds the threshold frequency ωth. As ω further increases, 〈QL〉 reaches
a maximum near ω∗ = 0.10, and changes its sign near ω∗ = 0.62.(The dependence of the
mean-ﬂow direction on the driving frequency is a common feature shared by many valveless
pumping systems. For example, in Ref. [34] such a dependence was demonstrated both
experimentally and numerically.) The reversed mean ﬂow reaches its maximum magnitude at
about ω∗ = 0.73, and vanishes at about ω∗ = 0.81, which corresponds to the onset frequency
ωcr for the purely-free responses in case I (marked with the abbreviation “ωI = ωcr” in Fig.
5.9(a)). When the driving frequency ω exceeds ωcr (but still is within the stability margin),
the numerically calculated values of 〈QL〉 become exceedingly small and cannot be shown in
Fig. 5.9(a). While this result may seem surprising at ﬁrst, it is actually predicted by the
asymptotic calculations. Speciﬁcally, according to the leading-order results, Eqs. (4.5) and
(4.6), the purely-free system responses would produce zero average ﬂowrate in the ﬂuid loop,
60 5. Further Numerical Results and Discussion
which is now conﬁrmed numerically.
In case II (with Vmin/Vmax = 0.33), the frequency dependence of 〈QL〉 depicted by the
(blue) dashed curve in Fig. 5.9(a) is qualitatively similar to that in case I for driving fre-
quencies up to ωcr (marked with “ωII = ωcr”). The only quantitative diﬀerences are that
〈QL〉 now changes sign (from positive to negative) at about ω∗ = 0.38, and vanishes at about
ω∗ = 0.50. However, while the purely–free responses having positive deﬁnite V0(t) again have
a vanishingly small mean ﬂowrate, a relatively large 〈QL〉 is produced when the V0 reservoir
is completely depleted. Speciﬁcally, this occurs when the driving frequency ω exceeds the
critical frequency ωv0, which corresponds to ω∗ = 0.56 and is marked with “ωII = ωv0” in
Fig. 5.9(a). Note in particular that the resulting mean ﬂowrate is about 100 times greater
than the maximum mean ﬂowrate that would be produced by system responses having a
nonzero actual duty cycle. This makes good intuitive sense, because the system restarting
following the complete depletion of the V0 reservoir generally would produce a much stronger
nonlinearity than that produced by the separation of the V0 reservoir and the actuator. V0
reservoir depletion has valve function, and drastically increases mean ﬂow rate. It was also
pointed out by Kenner et al. [82] that complete compression of a ﬂuid-ﬁlled valveless tube,
like the complete depletion of the V0 reservoir here, is very eﬀective in generating a mean ﬂow
in the tube. In the present model system, however, the V0 reservoir has to separate from the
actuator ﬁrst, before it can possibly be completely depleted. Careful modeling of the interac-
tions between the V0 reservoir and the compression actuator therefore still is important. For
the same reason, the mean ﬂowrate 〈QL〉 in case III, with Vmin/Vmax = 0.15 and depicted
by the (red) short-dashed curve in Fig. 5.9(a), also experiences a sudden increase of about
500 times as the driving frequency crosses ωv0, corresponding to ω∗ = 0.10 and marked with
“ωIII = ωv0.” Note also that since the depletion of the V0 reservoir occurs ﬁrst (i.e., at a
lower critical driving frequency) before purely-free responses arise in case III, the calculated
(positive) values of 〈QL〉 are never vanishingly small.
Some interesting observations also can be made by examining the temporal variations
of the volumetric ﬂowrates QL,R in various types of system responses (as an anonymous
reviewer kindly pointed it out). In particular, QL,R(t) in three representative responses with
Vmin/Vmax = 0.33 (i.e., case II discussed above) and driving frequencies f = 40, 45, and 50
Hz (corresponding to ω∗ = (ω − ωth)/(ωst − ωth) = 0.39, 0.52, and 0.64), respectively, are

the driving frequency f in Fig. 5.12(a). To understand the evolution of the curves in Fig.
5.12(a), let us observe ﬁrst in Figs. 5.5(a) and 5.5(b) that for ω > ωPF0 (the lower branch),
the system responses would transit from PF0 to CF0 (at ω = ωCF0 ), and then from CF0
back to PF0 (at ω = ωPF0, the upper branch) , before they eventually become seemingly
chaotic at f = fst. Accordingly, in Fig. 5.12(a), the θr curve ﬁrst bifurcates into a θs curve
and a θc curve at f = fPF0 = ωPF0/2pi = 47 Hz (or,f − fth = 23.4 Hz), which then merge
into a single θr curve at f = fPF0 = 51.9 Hz (or, f − fth = 28.3 Hz). And again, the PF0
responses would eventually become seemingly chaotic when f exceeds fst.
Finally, for the case of Vmin/Vmax = 0.15, the characteristic phases are plotted against
the driving frequency f in Fig. 5.12(b). (Note that, as the range of the driving frequency
is now much larger than that in previous cases, here the value of is plotted in logarithmic
scales.) Compared with the previous case (with Vmin/Vmax = 0.325 ), here the transition
of the system responses are much simpler, namely from PC to CF (at f = fth ), CF0 (at
f = fCF0 ), PF0 (at f = fPF0 ) in turn, and ﬁnally to the seemingly chaotic responses (at
f = fst ). Also, since all the important features of the characteristic phase curves have been
explained above, they are readily understandable in Fig. 5.12(b), and therefore will not be
over-discussed here.
68 5. Further Numerical Results and Discussion
5.5 Seemingly chaotic system responses
We now brieﬂy discuss some interesting features of the seemingly chaotic responses of the
system when the driving frequency f exceeds the stability-margin frequency fst. Note that,
as such responses seem to be chaotic, they are quite sensitive to the speciﬁc parameter values
of the system. However, for the purpose of demonstrating a number of qualitative features of
such responses, here we shall only consider the case of Vmin/Vmax = 0.33. It is also important
to note that, for such responses the temporal means (over one compression cycle) of the
ﬂowrates in the system would vary from cycle to cycle. So, to extract some orders out of
the seemingly chaotic responses, for each parameter setting the numerical computations are
run for 2000 compression cycles, and the temporal means of the aforementioned system state
variables are computed for each compression cycle. Of course, during the ﬁrst few cycles, the
variations in such temporal means may result partly from the initial transients. However, we
found that the initial transient eﬀects practically are negligible after a few dozen cycles. Also,
it suﬃces to keep track of the last 50 cycles (of the 2000 cycles of computation) to bring out
the general pictures of the system responses.
To illustrate the frequency dependences of the system responses for f > fst, it remains
useful to trace the variations of the critical phase angels θs, θc, θr, and θ0, as shown in Fig.
5.13(a). Note, however, that such phases generally vary from cycle to cycle, and that the
results for the last 50 cycles are plotted. So, for a given driving frequency f (which can be
represented by a circle in Fig. 5.13(a)), a certain critical phase (say θr ) may have multiple
values and hence be represented by several data points. Moreover, for f > fst, the critical
phases are extremely sensitive to a small variation in f . As a result, the data points in Fig.
5.13(a) appear to be scattering, and generally do not form continuous curves (while they
do in Figs. 5.11) – 5.12). (Note also that here the computations are carried out at the
driving-frequency increment of 1 Hz.)
However, some characteristic phases do seem to form continuous curves within a number
of driving-frequency windows. For example, in the frequency window bounded approximately
by 109 Hz and 177 Hz (labeled with “2T”in Fig. 5.13(a)), the separation phase (θs) and
collision phase (θc) appear to form two continuous curves, which start at about f = 109 Hz
and merge into a single curve of rebound phase (θr) at about f = 135 Hz. Meanwhile, the
zero volume phase (θ0) also appears to form a continuous curve throughout this frequency
70 5. Further Numerical Results and Discussion
window. Moreover, in the frequency window bounded approximately by 226 Hz and 266 Hz
(labeled with “3T”), the rebound phase (θr) and zero volume phase (θ0) appear to form
two continuous curves. Some insights about the dynamical behaviors of the“2T”and“3T”
responses can be gained by plotting the mean ﬂowrate in the L–tube, 〈QL〉 (normalized by
the characteristic ﬂowrate scale ∆Va/TLR ), against the driving frequency (subtracted by the
threshold frequency fth ); see Fig. 5.13(b). Two examples of such responses are indicated by
lines (a) and (b) in Fig. 5.13(b). As can be readily seen, for the“2T”and“3T”responses,
the mean ﬂowrates of the 50 cycles plotted in Fig. 5.13(b) appear to repeat every two cycles
and every three cycles, respectively, and that is exactly why the responses are named as such.
In fact, while being somewhat more diﬃcult to observe in Fig. 5.13(a), some more regularities
in the system responses can be observed in Fig. 5.13(b); two examples are indicated by lines
(c) and (d) there. Speciﬁcally, on lines (c) and (d), the mean ﬂowrates of the 50 plotted
cycles appear to repeat every three cycles and every ﬁve cycles, respectively. The regularities
of such responses also can be seen more clearly by plotting them in time domain; see Figs.
5.14 – 5.15.
Of course, there certainly are other less obvious regularities of the system responses in the
frequency range plotted in Figs. 5.13(a) and 5.13(b), and much much more at higher driving
frequencies. Meanwhile, outside the particular frequency windows within which such regular
responses exist, the seemingly chaotic responses can get as complicated as one can imagine.
However, as a detailed analysis of such response clearly is non-trivial, and is beyond the scope
of this work, it will not be further pursued. Instead, let us point out an additional observation
in Fig. 5.13(a). Speciﬁcally, it is seen in Fig. 5.13(a) that the V0 reservoir may stay in contact
with the compression actuator only when the driving frequency is lower than about 135 Hz.
Above that frequency, the separation–collision interaction between the V0 reservoir and the
actuator would no longer be possible (and the separation and collision phases cease to appear
in Fig. 5.13 (a)). What happen then are that, whenever the V0 reservoir collides with the
actuator they separate from each other immediately afterwards, and that each collision of
them would be so strong to completely deplete the V0 reservoir. As a result, in Fig. 5.13(a),
for f > 135 Hz, only the rebound and zero volume phases exist and are plotted there.
Finally, to conclude this discussion, let us speculate a few possible applications of the
system responses with driving frequencies f > fst. First, as can be readily seen in Fig.
72 5. Further Numerical Results and Discussion

76 6. Conclusion
V0 reservoir from the compression actuator, the onset frequency ωth and stability-margin
frequency ωst of the purely-free responses (which have an actual duty cycle of zero) are
obtained in Chap. 4. Furthermore, numerical solutions of the model for three representative
cases are carefully discussed in Chap. 5 to elucidate the complex dynamics of the model
system studied here, and to clarify the frequency dependence of the mean ﬂowrate and mean
pressures in the system.
While we have also studied the model system using other pre-compression ratios (than the
particular choice of γ = 0.4 here), the dependence of the numerical results upon the driving
frequency and other system parameters appear to be qualitatively similar to that discussed
in this report. Such results therefore are not included here for brevity of the presentation.
However, it should be noted that when the system is not pre-compressed, i.e., when the
compression actuator initially is not in contact with the V0 reservoir, they would collide with
each other at any driving frequency, and are expected to produce a signiﬁcant mean ﬂowrate
thereby. Although some numerical results have been obtained, a detailed discussion of them
is beyond the scope of this report, and will be presented elsewhere.
For periodic system responses repeating themselves in one compression cycle, ﬁve diﬀerent
types of responses are found, which are referred to above as the purely–contact (PC), contact–
free (CF), purely–free (PF), contact–free with reservoir depletion (CF0), and purely–free with
reservoir depletion (PF0) responses (and illustrated in Fig.5.6 and Fig.5.7 ). By examining
the dependences on the volume ratio Vmin/Vmax of a few critical frequencies at which the
system responses undergo a transition in type, the parameter boundaries within which such
responses exist have been clariﬁed (see Fig.5.5). Furthermore, the system mean ﬂowrate and
mean pressure are also calculated (see Fig.5.9), we ﬁnd that these mean values are highly cor-
related with the nonlinear eﬀects of actuator impact. Moreover, for a few particular values of
Vmin/Vmax , the driving-frequency dependences of a number of characteristic phases, namely
the separation phase θs, collision phase θc , rebound phase θr , and reservoir depletion phase
θ0 (see Fig.5.11 and Fig.5.12), the interrelations of the diﬀerent types of system responses
have been identiﬁed. It is believed that these results not only are useful for understanding
the nonlinear impact dynamics of valveless pumping systems, but also would help optimize
the design of practical valveless pumps with certain prescribed speciﬁcations.
It has also been demonstrated in this report that, for driving frequencies f higher than

80 6. Conclusion
Lee et al. presented an active micromixer. Pressure perturbations are applied transversally to
the main stream by means of two adjacent channels leading to chaotic–like mixing [88]. Recall
the seemly chaotic responses of Fig. 5.13 (b), we can attempt to extend the observation into
the idea of the active micromixer. The nonlinear eﬀects of actuator impact and the system
stability analysis may be helpful to enhance mixing eﬀects.
We may, therefore, reasonably conclude that, the interaction between the actuator and
the pliant part of the valveless pumping system is indeed an important issue, and we propose
a methodology to deal with this overlook problem.
6.3 Future work
To our knowledge, this report appears to be the ﬁrst careful study of the eﬀects of actuator
impact in valveless pumping system. In order to obtain a better understanding of valveless
pumping mechanism, some additional works are worth pursuing and are brieﬂy discussed
below:
1. Identiﬁcation of system response with more parameter studies
In this report we only carry out a set of parameters study. For more understanding of
the system responses, more parameter studies should be carried out to clarify the most
important mechanism in valveless pumping. The same may be said, no doubt, of the
seemingly chaotic system response. Especially, it is diﬃcult to analyse its response due
to the system instability.
2. Non–pre–compressed and loop blocking system
So far, we have seen that two non–linearity eﬀects, actuator impact and loop blocking
condition plays an important role in the model we proposed here. A natural extension
of this work is to study these two non–linearities especially. It is an inevitable prob-
lem and we can infer that the non–pre–compressed system responses would be more
complicated than the pre–compression case. The system response patterns may quite
diﬀerent from the pre–compression model since the reservoir will separate from the ac-
tuator when the driving frequency is not zero. Thus, nonlinear impact eﬀects should
be taken into account initially. The question which we must consider next is the loop
blocking condition. Since the V0 reservoir depletion has valve function, and drastically
82 6. Conclusion
and economical experimental design needs to be developed and reﬁned to demonstrated
the model we proposed here.
6. More complicated ﬂuid loops and multi-actuators
Finally, from the viewpoint of biomedical applications, we expect that a deep and com-
plete understanding of valveless pumping mechanisms would motivate certain innovative
designs of heart assist devices and more understanding in biology as we discuss before in
Chap. 1. And for more practical applications, it is necessary to construct more practi-
cal models, such as complicated ﬂuid loop, for example, bifurcation structure, or multi–
actuators driving system. Some special characteristics or restrictions of physiological of
engineering problem should also be considered to reﬁne the mathematical model.
7. Related experimental works
At present, experiments are being carried out in our laboratory to validate the many
interesting theoretical ﬁndings discussed above. Speciﬁcally, a closed-loop apparatus
and an open-loop one have been constructed, and substantial data have been obtained.
In Chapter 7 (in Chinese), the experimental setups are described, and some preliminary
results are discussed. The purpose here is to give a brief outline of the experimental
results obtained in this project. More systematic and comprehensive discussion of the
experimental results will soon appear in the form of two Master’s degree theses (by Mr.
王文憲 and Mr. 洪孟漢).
8. Self-evaluation of the achievements of this project
Brieﬂy, several conference papers, refereed journal papers, and degree theses have been
published based upon the theoretical and experimental results of this project. Please
see Chapter 8 (in Chinese) for a detailed self-evaluation. It will be demonstrated there
that this project has been successfully carried out and have been quite fruitful.

實際系統整體裝置與實驗流程如圖 7.6與圖 7.7，實驗時我們調整擠壓頻率 (0.1 Hz 至 6
Hz)，並在各頻率下利用壓力計測得遠端水槽（如圖 7.6）的壓力值，而迴路中流量計 A、B
則分別量測兩分支水管的流量，位移感測器 A、B 分別負責測量馬達驅動時所帶動的上板
（圖 7.2的平板 A）和受到碰撞擠壓時連結伸縮囊的下板（圖 7.2的平板 B），高速攝影機則
拍攝液面高變化，近一步推知無流量計一側之動態流量變化。完成一次掃頻後，調整擠壓機
構，在不同進程下以及預壓與否重複進行掃頻 (預壓表示靜止時擠壓器於上死點就緊貼著伸
縮囊，而無預壓則是會分開一段距離，所以無預壓者從最低頻率開始運作就會有撞擊，而預
壓者則是達到一定頻率才開始碰撞，此頻率即為門檻頻率)。改變擠壓頻率會造成系統迴路內
的淨流量發生變化，換言之，系統內的淨流量可以不用藉由閥門的開關而是利用頻率的變化
來達到控制流量大小。藉由位移感測器的量測觀察出平板 A、B 的碰撞型態，以分析兩者的
接觸模式，因為不同的接觸模式對於系統的流量變化也會有所影響。在此我們還增加了一個

近，根據圖 7.3所示伸縮容器機械性質可近似一線性彈簧，因此自由運動時可視為簡諧

使伸縮囊在較靠近端點處運動，與擠壓器碰撞的速度則相對較小。平均流量整體而言

由圖 7.15，極低頻時亦無顯著影響，也同樣於 0.4 Hz 後兩條曲線始分開，但是之後整

影響需視預壓與否而定。整體而言，預壓時進程較小者流量較低；分離時則進程較小
者流量較高。
7.4.4 系統動態之探討
為了觀察系統動態流量之特性，將平均流量再細分為接觸模態 (CM) 與自由模態 (FM)。
接觸模態即為擠壓器與伸縮囊接觸時之平均流量，自由模態則為擠壓器與伸縮囊分離時之
平均流量。本系統流量量測裝置的設計、以及管線的配置，使得右管流阻遠大於左管，圖
7.18為右管之接觸模態及自由模態流量與頻率關係，圖 7.19則為左管。由圖可以看出，在流
阻較大的一側 (右管)，於接觸模態時流量不一定排出，而自由模態時流量也不一定回抽，甚
至接觸模態與自由模態呈現規律交錯的現象，亦即在某些頻率下，分離與接觸的平均流量相
等。但是在流阻較小的一側 (左管)，則很服從地呈現接觸就排出，分離就回抽的現象
98 7. 實驗研究部份
高，流量逐漸趨向零，但在某幾點頻率會有微小的逆流與較小的峰值產生，而壓力也在有限
頻率內趨近一定值。實驗亦觀測接觸模式，發現在不同頻率之下會有不同之碰撞型態，於極
低頻下（如圖 7.10，0.2 Hz），伸縮囊與擠壓器分離後約在平衡點（displacement=0）附近上
下震盪，此時平均流量為 0.27 ml/s；最大流量頻率下（圖 7.11，0.8 Hz），分離後的伸縮囊
隨即平緩抬升至下一撞擊點，此時平均流量為 2.64 ml/s；而較高頻下（圖 7.12，4.8 Hz），
伸縮囊分離後停留在低於平衡點處做小幅度的震盪，此時平均流量為 -0.2 ml/s；因此像這樣
不規則的流量趨勢除了跟擠壓頻率有關以外，同時也跟碰撞型態有很大的關聯，亦即本實驗
發現了造就無閥系統之特性的另一重要因素: 碰撞型態。另外本實驗也設計出一個雙向動態
流量的量測方法，可以有效解決市面上大多數流量計只能量測穩定單向流量及反應不夠快的
問題，而有利於此領域的更進一步實驗研究。實驗也探討了擠壓進程、預壓與否對平均流量
的影響，並藉此發現了衝擊效應對流量所造成的影響。系統動態方面，將接觸模態與自由模
態、左管與右管分開討論，發現兩管不同的流阻造就了不同的擠壓反應。目前的研究方向專
注於更進一步的碰撞型態探討，以找出定量區分碰撞型的方式，並進一步用以解釋流量的非
線性變化。另外，開放系統也已架構完成並進行實驗中。如圖 7.20，於非對位置進行擠壓，
運作一段時間後系統進入穩態，此時左右兩管水柱將出現一高度差，而此高度差則用來作為

Abstract:
Valveless pumping assists in fluid transport in various biomedical and engineering
systems. In this talk, we shall focus on one factor that has often been overlooked in
previous studies of valveless pumping, namely the impact that a compression actuator
exerts upon the pliant part of the system when they collide. In particular, a fluid-
filled closed-loop system is considered, which consists of two distensible reservoirs
connected by two rigid tubes, with one of the reservoirs compressed by an actuator
at a prescribed frequency. A lumped-parameter model with constant coefficients
accounting for mass and momentum balance in the system is constructed. Based upon
such a model, a mean flow in the fluid loop can only be produced by system asymmetry
and the nonlinear effects associated with actuator impact. Through asymptotic and
numerical solutions of the model, a systematic parameter study is carried out, thereby
revealing the rich and complex system dynamics that strongly depends upon the
driving frequency of the actuator and other geometrical and material properties of the
system. The driving-frequency dependence of the mean flowrate in the fluid loop and
that of the mean reservoir pressures also are examined for a number of representative
cases.

ABSTRACT 
 
Valveless pumping assists in fluid transport in 
various organisms and engineering systems.  In a 
previous work, to study the actuator impact effects on 
valveless pumping, we constructed a piecewise-linear 
lumped-parameter model for a closed-loop system, 
which consists of two distensible fluid reservoirs 
connected by two rigid tubes.  The preliminary 
asymptotic and numerical results of that work 
indicated that the system dynamics is rather rich and 
complex, and strongly depends upon the driving 
frequency of the actuator (which periodically 
compresses one of the distensible reservoirs) and 
other system parameters.  Here, a more 
comprehensive numerical study on the 
aforementioned model is carried out, so as to clarify 
how many different types of system responses can be 
excited, and to locate the parameter boundaries 
within which each type exists.  Moreover, by 
examining the driving-frequency dependences of a 
number of characteristic phases (such as the phase of 
the compression cycle at which the actuator collides 
with or separates from the distensible reservoir it acts 
upon), the interrelations between different types of 
system responses are identified. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
In various organisms and engineering systems, 
the working fluid transport more or less is assisted by 
valveless pumping. For example, even when the 
heart 's valves fail ,  blood circulation in the 
cardiovascular system still is maintained to some 
extent (see Liebau, 1954, and Moser, 1998). Various   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other biomedical systems involving valveless 
pumping also are discussed in Moser (1998).  
Meanwhile, in microfluidics, valveless “impedance 
pumps” have been fabricated by Rinderknecht et al. 
(2005), and it is expected that they would be 
particularly suitable for handling sensitive biofluids.  
One way to achieve valveless pumping is to compress 
a pliant tube periodically at an asymmetric site from 
the tube’s interfaces to different tubing or reservoirs, 
so that pressure waves are excited and propagate on 
the tube.  Due to impedance mismatch at the tube 
ends, the waves would partly reflect, and hence build 
up a mean pressure head that drives the fluid flow in 
the tube (see Hickerson et al., 2005, Hickerson and 
Gharib, 2006, and Wen and Chang, 2009). 
Despite the existence of a sizable research 
literature on valveless pumping (for a brief review, 
see Yang and Wang, 2010, and references cited 
therein), a full understanding of its mechanisms has 
not yet been obtained.  To a certain extent, this is 
because that valveless systems may differ in 
configuration and operation conditions (e.g., the 
compression frequency; see Hickerson et al., 2005, 
and Wen and Chang, 2009), and therefore rely upon 
one or more different mechanisms to pump fluids.  
It is intuitively clear, however, that for a valveless 
pumping system to produce any mean flow, a 
necessary condition (but not necessarily a sufficient 
one; see Yang and Wang, 2010) is to drive (i.e., 
compress) the system at an asymmetric site with 
respect to its configuration.  It is also arguable that 
appropriate theoretical modeling is as important as 
extensive experimental studies in furnishing a more 
complete understanding of valveless pumping 
mechanisms. 
As pointed by Yang and Wang (2010), in 
existing mathematical models of valveless pumping, 
the interaction between the compression actuator and 
the pliant part of the system in question has often 
been modeled in rather oversimplified ways.  
Specifically, in some models the instantaneous 
deformation of the pliant part of the system is 
prescribed in a manner not inconsistent (but not 
absolutely consistent either, as demonstrated by Yang 
and Wang, 2010) with the actuator motion (see, e.g., 
Ottesen, 2003, and Huang et al., 2010), while in some
