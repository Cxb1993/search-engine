英文摘要 
In this project, extremely high potential barrier height and gate turn-on voltage of a novel 
GaAs field-effect transistor with n+/p+/n+/p+/n double camel-like gate structure are demonstrated. 
The maximum electric field and potential barrier height of the double camel-like gate are 
substantially enhanced by the addition of another n+/p+ layers in gate region, as compared with the 
conventional n+/p+/n single camel-like gate. For a 1 x 100 μm2 device, a potential barrier height up 
to 2.741 V is obtained. Experimentally, a high gate turn-on voltage up to + 4.9 V is achieved 
because two reverse-biased junctions of the double camel-like gate absorb part of positive gate 
voltage. In addition, the transistor action shows a maximum saturation current of 730 mA/mm and 
an extrinsic transconductance of 166 mS/mm. 
 
二、 計畫的緣由與目的 
GaAs-based field-effect transistors (FETs), such as metal-semiconductor FETs (MESFETs) [1, 
2], doped-channel FETs (DCFETs) [3, 4], and modulation-doped FETs (MODFETs) [5, 6], etc., 
have been widely developed for digital circuit applications because of their simplicities and 
excellent device performances. However, the low gate turn-on voltage resulting from the low 
potential barrier height of Schottky gate severely affects the noise margin in inverter circuit 
applications [4, 7]. On the contrary, high gate turn-on voltage can prevent the injection of channel 
carriers into the gate electrode and allow the drain output current to increase. 
Over the past years, due to the pn depletion in gate region the n+/p+/n camel-like gate FETs 
performing with high barrier heights were well investigated [8-11]. The camel-like gate also 
provides some advantages when compared with conventional Schottky gate, such as i) elimination 
of the metallurgical difficulties due to the ohmic contact, ii) relatively easy adjustment of the 
built-in voltage, and iii) the potential for improving reliability in adverse environments and under 
high power dissipation conditions [8]. Recently, we have fabricated and demonstrated n- and 
p-channel camel-like gate pseudomorphic MODFETs (pMODFETs) [10, 11]. A gate turn-on 
voltage larger than 1.7 V (2V) was achieved which can be attributed to the pn depleted junction 
and the presence of large conduction (valence) band discontinuity at InGaP/InGaAs 
heterostructure for the n-channel (p-channel) pMODFET.  
In this project, a novel GaAs n+/p+/n+/p+/n double camel-like gate FET exhibiting extremely 
high potential barrier height and gate turn-on voltage is fabricated and demonstrated. The high gate 
turn-on voltage increasing the forward gate operation voltage and input voltage swing is suitable 
for linear and signal amplifiers and inverter circuit applications [4, 10]. The electric-field 
distributions and energy-band diagrams of the single (conventional) and double (studied) 
camel-gate devices are investigated and compared. As compared to the conventional camel-gate 
devices, the potential barrier height and gate turn-on voltage are enhanced efficiently by the 
addition of another thin n+/p+ layers in middle region of the camel-like gate.  
 
三、 研究方法 
 
 
In order to investigate the improvement of the double camel-like gate structure on the gate 
turn-on voltage, two devices denoted devices A (our double camel-like device) and B 
(conventional single camel-like device) are compared. Similar to the device A, only a 50 Å p+ = 
2 x 1019 cm-3 GaAs layer was added between n+-GaAs cap layer and n-GaAs channel in the 
device B. By solving Possion’s equation, the electric-field distributions of the two devices are 
shown in Fig.3. In the device A, the designed principle is that the thin p+/n+/p+ GaAs triple layers 
must be completely depleted at equilibrium and under gate biases. Similarly, the thin p+ GaAs 
layer of device B must be entirely depleted. With respect to the device A, four pn junctions are 
denoted as J1, J2, J3, and J4, respectively. It can be seen that the maximum positive electric field 
is substantially increased and another triangular-shaped positive electric-field distribution is 
formed by the addition of another n+/p+ layers in gate region as compared to the device B. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.3. Electric-field distributions of the single and double camel-like gate FETs. 
 
The energy band diagrams of depletion region for the devices A and B are illustrated in Fig.4. 
Double camel-like gate is formed in the device A, while only a single camel-like gate is formed in 
the device B. At equilibrium, the potential barrier height up to 2.741 V is observed for the device A, 
while it is only 0.851 V for the device B. The second triangular-shaped positive electric-field 
distribution also helps to increase the potential barrier height, as seen in Figs. 3 and 4. It is worthy 
to note that the turn-on voltage (4.9 V) is larger by a factor of about 2 than the potential barrier 
height (2.7 V) at equilibrium. The detailed mechanism corresponding to the large gate turn-on 
voltage can be explained as follows. 
As a positive gate voltage is applied, the J2 and J4 are forward-biased while the J1 and J3 are 
reverse-biased. Because the concentration of channel is lower than that of the n+/p+/n+/p+ 
heavy-doped camel-gate layers, the variety of depletion thickness mainly occurs at the channel 
region. Significantly, it is true that the first p+ layer is completely depleted by the n channel and the 
first n+ layer. With the increase of positive gate voltage, the deplettion depth into the first p+ layer 
by the contribution of depletion charge in channel layer is decreased and then the depletion depth 
into the first n+ layer by the contribution of depletion charge in the first p+ layer is increased (note 
that the p+/n+/p+ layers are entirely depleted). Thus, the reverse-biased J3 will cause the substantial 
elevation of energy band in the first n+ “heavy-doped” layer. Similar to the above condition, the 
energy band of the second n+ “heavy-doped” layer (cap layer) is also elevated, as seen in Fig.4. 
Thus, the reverse-biased J3 and J1 could absorb part of positive gate voltage and a relatively high 
gate turn-on voltage is expectable. The high turn-on voltage could enhance the drain output circuit 
and gate voltage swing. However, as to the device B, only a reverse-biased junction helps to 
五、結論 
In summary, a novel GaAs double camel-like gate FET has been successfully fabricated and 
demonstrated. For the studied device, relatively high barrier height, gate turn-on voltage, and 
broad gate voltage swing are obtained attributed to the insert of another n+/p+ layers in the middle 
region of the double camel-like gate structure. These results indicate that the studied device is 
promising for linear and signal amplifiers and inverter circuit applications.
