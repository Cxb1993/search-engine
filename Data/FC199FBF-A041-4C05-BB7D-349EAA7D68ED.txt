2study attempts to identify the critical factors and sub-factors of these organizations in
implementing CP using the FAHP approach. A hierarchical model was elaborated to help
visualize which factors are prioritized and formulate strategies for CP implementation.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Implementing CP needs to be integrated within the whole organization with a
continuousand open system handled by an effective leadership of the organizational structure,
as well as an effective communication to customers [7]. An exhaustive list of critical factors
integrated from literature review on CP implementation is shown in Figure 1.

3. METHODOLOGY
AHP and ANP, developed by Satty in 1971 and 1996, have been widely employed in
tackling the multi-criterion decision making problems. AHP is based on some algebraic
assumptions including independence and hierarchy among different levels. Yet, ANP is
grounded on interdependence and feedback. In the research, structured framework depends on
the previous literatures in which independence and hierarchy can be obviously discerned;
therefore, the AHP is chosen rather than the ANP in the study.
However, it has been generally criticized because of the use of a discrete scale of one to
nine which cannot handle the uncertainty and ambiguity present in deciding the priorities of
different attributes (See Table 1). The hierarchy of the decision variables is the subject of a
pairwise comparison of the AHP. Traditionally, the pairwise comparison is established using
a nine-point scale which converts the human preferences between available alternatives as
equal importance, weak importance, strongly importance, demonstrated importance and
absolute importance. Even though the discrete scale of AHP has the advantages of simplicity
and ease of use, it is not sufficient to take into account the uncertainty associated with the
mapping of one's perception to a number [8]. The linguistic assessment of human feelings and
judgments are vague and it is not reasonable to represent it in terms of precise numbers. It
feels more confident to give interval judgments than fixed value judgments; hence, a fuzzy
concept might be considered to compensate the insufficiency of AHP for the uncertainty
problem.
Fuzzy set theory has proven advantages within vague, imprecise and uncertain contexts
and it resembles human reasoning in its use of approximate information and uncertainty to
generate decisions. It was specially designed to mathematically represent uncertainty and
vagueness and provide formalized tools for dealing with the imprecision intrinsic to many
decision problems. Fuzzy set theory implements classes and grouping of data with boundaries
that are not sharply defined (i.e. fuzzy). Fuzzy set theory includes the fuzzy logic, fuzzy
arithmetic, fuzzy mathematical programming, fuzzy graph theory and fuzzy data analysis,
usually the term fuzzy logic is used to describe all of these. The FAHP is the fuzzy extension
of AHP to efficiently handle the fuzziness of the data involved in the decision of best CP
implementation factors.

4. EMPIRICAL RESULT
The whole hierarchy of the selection of CP implementation factors can be easily
visualized from Figure 1. After the construction of the hierarchy, the different priority weights
of each criteria and attributes are calculated using the FAHP approach. The comparison of the
importance or preference of one criterion or attribute over another can be done with the help
of the questionnaire. The preference of one measure over another is decided by the available
research, the current business scenario and by the experience of the experts. The method of
calculating priority weights of the different decision criteria using FAHP is discussed below.

5. CONCLUSION
This study model helps organizations identify the differences between the desired and
current situations, and then identify the improvement areas and develop the strategies for the
CP implementation. In addition, the company can also use the assessment results as a
benchmark with competitors and other “best-in-class” organizations. To manage CP
successfully, its measurement indicators must be defined and prioritized. Because of the
subjective of the attributes used in the evaluation, AHP is the most appropriate method for
this problem. However, since the experts prefer natural language expressions rather than sharp
numerical values in their assessments, the classical AHP may not yield with a satisfactory
result. This study proposes a fuzzy AHP framework to weigh the CP implementation factors.
FAHP approach has been presented to prioritize CP implementation factors for a
manufacturing organization to implement one of its most critical parts used in management
process and under multiple criteria’s decision making in the fuzzy environment. The main
criteria and attributes have been decided which are based on the current business scenario and
experience of the experts in the respective fields. The large number of criteria and attributes
demonstrated the complexities being involved in the selection of CP implementation factors.
Each factor affecting the CP implementation have been analyzed and discussed. This paper
has made a significant contribution to identify the important criteria and paves the way to
consider these practically relevant and interesting issues of selection of CP implementation
factors in the fuzzy environment.
We emphasize that the contribution of this research contributes to build up and select the
theoretical model of CP implementation priority. The researchers and practitioners are paying
more attention to the phenomenon of the social responsibility and involved in present
management status. This study takes a step in that direction of setting priorities of clarifying,
organizing and integrating terms and concepts relevant to CP implementation and
management aspects in the firm process.
