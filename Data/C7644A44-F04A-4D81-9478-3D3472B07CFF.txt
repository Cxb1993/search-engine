Abstract 
Over the Internet, e-Learning has speeded up the 
knowledge transfer without restrictions on time and 
space in recent years. In order to achieve the goal of 
knowledge sharing and reusing interactively, lots of 
available e-Learning standards have been adapted to 
complete this purpose, such as SCORM (Sharable 
Content Object Reference Model)、IEEE LTSC LOM、
IMS CC(Common Cartridge), and IMS QTI(Question 
& Test Interoperability). Normally, learning objects 
meeting these standards are sharable with other e-
Learning platforms. Most e-Learning platforms, 
however, are unable to share learning objects directly 
on the Internet. In recent years, Cloud computing has 
provided people the way to share distributed resources 
and services over the Internet in the open environment. 
Therefore, Cloud computing makes the applications be 
assigned in a great number of distributed computers, 
rather than local computer or remoter servers. With 
this in mind, this project employs the characteristics of 
Cloud computing to provide a promising infrastructure 
to compute and store resources as services. 
Furthermore, this project introduces Cloud computing 
into an e-Learning platform to allow the integration of 
different e-Learning standards to enhance 
interoperability of learning objects. By combining the 
characteristics of e-Learning and approach of Cloud 
computing, educators have not to re-construct learning 
objects to satisfy e-Learning environments developed 
from different e-Learning standards. 
 
中文摘要 
    近幾年，數位學習透過網際網路在沒有時間
與空間的限制下，加快了知識轉移。為了達成
知識共享和重複使用之目的，許多數位學習標
準已陸續被提出以滿足此一目的，例如
SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference 
Model)、IEEE LTSC LOM、IMS CC (Common 
Cartridge) 及 IMS QTI (Question & Test 
Interoperability)。一般而言，在數位學習平台
上應能分享由這些學習標準所包裝編製完成的
學習物件。然而，因為學習者所處的學習平台
環境與學習物件被包裝時所使用的標準不一致，
導致在大多數的數位學習平台上並不能直接分
享這些學習物件。近一、二年來，雲端運算技
術透過網際網路，使能在開放式環境下，分享
分散式資源及服務。因此，雲端運算使得網路
服務能在許多分散式電腦上被運用，而不必僅
侷限在區域電腦或是遠端伺服器上。基於此，
雲端運算技術的特色在於提供一個計算基礎結
構和儲存資源的服務。所以，本研究計畫提出
一套以雲端運算技術為基礎之可分享的數位學
習架構機制，得以整合異質性之數位學習標準
所包裝完成之學習物件，以提高學習物件之交
互性。藉由結合數位學習的特點和雲端運算技
術的理論，讓使用學習物件的學習者不需要重
新建構由不同數位學習標準所編製之學習物件，
以滿足一較有彈性之數位學習環境。 
 
1 Introduction 
 
E-Learning plays an important role in creating a 
good learning environment with the rapid 
development in internet technology. Over the past 
decade, an increasing number of schools and 
businesses have set up E-Learning platforms for 
their students and employees for the purpose of 
efficiency. Generally speaking, a good learning 
environment involves an authoring system, and 
LMS (Learning Management System), and 
learning object repository to create, execute, and 
store the teaching content (Bohl et al., 2002). 
Especially, the LMS plays to deliver the desired 
learning objects when and as needed and to track 
the learner’s reactions and responses. There are 
lots of famous e-Learning standards launched to 
support E-Learning environment, such as 
SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference 
Model) (http://www.adlnet.org/), IEEE LTSC 
LOM (Learning Object Metadata) 
(http://ieeeltsc.org/), and IMS Common Cartridge 
(http://www.imsglobal.org/specifications.html). 
Basically, learning objects meeting E-Learning 
standards are sharable with another LMS. 
However, every LMS platform runs its own 
learning objects and cannot be exchanged with 
another LMS. The main problem is that every 
individual LMS does not have the capability to 
share learning objects directly with another LMS. 
This is due to the lack of a reliable sharing 
mechanism among these acknowledged standards 
such that results in an isolated E-Learning 
platform. In this project, we make use of Cloud 
computing platform to provide a necessary 
foundation for a sharing E-Learning platform, 
where learning objects can be shared and reused 
significantly between E-Learning standards. 
 
4 
 
3 Design and Implementation of the 
Cloud Computing Architecture 
 
3.1 System Architecture 
A sharable E-Learning architecture based on 
Cloud computing infrastructure is composed of 
three layers, from the bottom to top it is followed 
by Infrastructure layer, Middleware layer, and 
Application layer. The architecture model is 
shown in Figure 1. 
 
 
Figure 1. Architecture of a Sharable E-Learning Based 
on Cloud Computing 
 
There, the Infrastructure Layer is mainly used 
as the E-Learning resource pool that includes 
hardware and software virtualization technologies 
to ensure the stability and reliability of the 
infrastructure. At the same time, this layer 
provides the network supported environment and 
the basic realization environment of service-
oriented architecture to supply the computing and 
storage capacity for the higher level. 
The Middleware Layer mainly supplies a 
sharable platform to become a software system of 
an actual run of storage, interoperability, and 
provision of resources, and it is the e-Learning 
web development integration platform. The 
sharable platform consists of two modules: 
CNRI’s (Corporation for National Research 
Initiatives) Handler System Module 
(http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) and Metadata 
Transformation System Module (Yen et al., 208). 
The former is utilized to record the metadata 
description and physical resources in teaching 
resources. The latter illustrates a flow chart of 
metadata transformation for a variety of e-
Learning standards.  
The Application Layer is the last application 
platform to supply services for learners. At this 
layer, Cloud computing provides convenient 
access to the E-Learning resources, such as 
authoring tool and content repository. Besides, 
the layer can apply to different application areas 
according to the specific needs of users, such as 
office automation, personal space-based service, 
and e-commerce, and so on. 
 
3.2 CNRI’s Handler System Module 
An identification mechanism called Handler 
System is proposed by Corporation for National 
Research Initiatives. Handler system can be 
considered as an indexing method for general 
purposes which provide efficient, extendable, and 
secure Name Service. The Handler System in our 
work aims to provide a resolution service in the 
back-end learning content repository. Figure 2 
shows the registration process and the returned 
parameters. 
 
Figure 2. The Registration Process and the Returned 
Parameters of Handler System 
 
An example in figure 2 could be illustrated as 
below: 
<HandleID>=<NamingAuthority>"/" 
LocalName> 
A Handler is comprised of 2 main parts: 
Handle Naming Authority and Handle Local 
Name. If a handler is formed as 123/456, the 
Naming Authority would be 123, and the Local 
Name of the handler would be 456. The Local 
Name in the belonging Naming Authority is 
unique and represents a specific URL for 
allocating the learning resources. In this paper, 
we utilize the “HandleID” returned by CNRI 
service server to be the basis of identification of 
the learning resources and metadata description 
while re-aggregating them into the new learning 
content structure. Through this mechanism, the 
edited learning materials would be given a unique 
ID such that we could do the modification 
without lost of relevant information. 
 
3.3 Metadata Transformation System Module 
The flow chart of metadata transformation system 
module for different E-Learning standards is 
well-defined and we also make it in an order. The

3 : assign Handler Identification to elements in  
            
     for each elements k in     
              
    
     
            
     where                          and 
                         
4 : check handler identification of required elements 
     if (  
  =   
 ) 
          load    
    
     
   to     
    
     
   
     else skip 
5 : convert generated metadata template to expected 
metadata format 
              
The algorithm presents the processing of the 
metadata transformation. Firstly, the system will 
detect the operation environment, e.g. MOODLE 
for SCORM-compliant course and IMS Course 
Reader for course package followed Common 
Cartridge format, that user is coping with. In this 
phrase, structural expressions, for both input (   ) 
and output (    ), will be generated. Then, the 
system will automatically fill the     by using 
the detection result of client. Two major elements 
are included in the expression. One is for 
detecting the header information (       ) of a 
course package, while the other one is the 
annotation for storing actual metadata 
organization and corresponding values. Secondly, 
the system will utilize the function, 
getSchemaType, to compare the source metadata, 
the courses on server side, and the designated 
metadata, the client side. If they are different, the 
system will translate the organization annotation, 
    , to another general expression by following 
the format of IMS Global Handler System. The 
Handler System can be separated into two parts 
combining a series of numeric and/or alphabet. 
The first part,    , represents the identification 
and the major category. The second part then 
identifies the corresponding resource types and 
the values. After obtaining this information, a 
candidate, null annotation set     , will be 
generated for receiving the source metadata. In 
this phrase, the reciprocity, between source and 
result metadata, will be determined by a pre-
defined mapping table. Then the system can 
transfer the value from the source metadata 
description to the one we created. 
 
4 Performance Evaluation 
 
In this section, we focus on evaluating the 
performance of the proposed metadata 
transformation strategy under the support of 
cloud-based environment. Three test courses, two 
standard HTML-based courses released by ADL 
and a customized course includes several 
multimedia content, are utilized to perform this 
experiment. The organizations of the courses are 
shown below. 
 
Course 1: Photoshop_None 
 HTML-based learning content 
 Simple course cluster structure 
 Without SCORM sequencing 
information 
Course 2: Photoshop_KnowledgePaced 
 HTML-based learning content 
 Normal course cluster structure 
 With SCORM sequencing information 
Course 3: Customized Course 
 Hybrid learning content 
 Complex course cluster structure 
 With SCORM sequencing information 
 
In the test courses, we assume that all of the 
source metadata format is complied with the 
SCORM and will have the following metadata 
organization.

sex, age, status of marriage, degree of education, resident 
areas, occupation, monthly income and credit cards. In all 
the factors, only degree of education s makes a great impact 
on how the pick-up service in convenience store affects 
consumers’ trust in online shopping. People who graduated 
from college consider service promoting consumers’ trust in 
online shopping. However, people who graduated from high 
school consider security promoting consumers’ trust in 
online shopping. Thus, H1 is partly ‘Yes’. 
     In H2, Customer’s trust model in online shopping based 
on pick-up in the convenience stores differs very much 
among Internet users with different browsing experience. 
The factors are : different Internet browsing experience, 
different online frequency and most often online places. All 
the factors didn’t have an impact. Thus, H2 was ‘No’. 
     In H3, Consumers with different Internet shopping 
experience make an impact on consumers’ trust model in 
online shopping. The experience are: picking up goods in 
convenience store, picking up goods in convenience store in 
past 6 months, average cost of online shopping, pick-up 
service in convenience store and receiving way. All the 
factors, only whether the consumer had experience pick-up 
goods in convenience store made a great impact. Thus, H3 
was partly ‘Yes’. 
V. CONCLUSION 
    The main contribution of this paper is to investigate 
consumers’ trust in online shopping based on pick-up goods 
in the convenience stores in Taiwan. Firstly, two of the three 
hypotheses support the relationship between pick-up goods 
behavior in the convenience stores and consumers’ trust. 
Secondly, in the results of statistic analysis receiving from 
227 valid questionnaires, this paper shows that pick-up 
goods in the convenience stores is one of important factors 
that contribute to consumers’ trust. Finally, this paper makes 
a valuable contribution not only to the information online 
shop managers needed but also the overall body of 
consumers’ trust and diffusion research. The influence 
factors of pick-up goods in the convenience stores to 
consumers’ trust concluded as follows: 
1. Pick-up goods in convenience stores can promote 
consumers’ trust in online shopping. By review and 
analysis of data, the average point of trust is over 3 
(87.23%). It shows that 90% of the participants 
considered pick-up goods in convenience stores could 
promote consumers’ trust model in online shopping. 
2. The characteristics of pick-up goods in convenience 
stores. By analysis of factors, we conclude three 
characteristics of pick-up goods in convenience stores: 
service, convenience, and safety. Convenience is the 
highest with 4.38 points; safety comes to the second 
with 4.27 points, finally service has 4.09 points. It 
showed convenience is the most important factor. 
3. There are three major advantages of pick-up goods in 
convenience stores. 24-hour service is the best (4.52 
points), free to choose receiving time can promote 
consumers’ trust model in online shopping; easy to 
reach convenience stores (4.51 points) and convenience 
store is near (4.447 points) show easy of receiving can 
promote consumers’ trust model in online shopping; 
delivery cost is low (3.91 points) makes a small part of 
impact. 
4. Degrees of education make an impact on consumers’ 
trust model in online shopping. 
5. Whether the consumer had experience of pick-up goods 
in convenience store make an impact on consumers’ 
trust model in online shopping. The one who had 
experience of pick-up goods in convenience store 
considered convenience is the key point of higher trust 
in online shopping.
