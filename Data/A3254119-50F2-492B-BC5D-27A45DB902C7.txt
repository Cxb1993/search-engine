  
Abstract--A closed-loop 2-stage multiphase switched- 
capacitor (MPSC) converter is proposed by variable-
phase control (VPC) and pulse-width-modulation 
(PWM) technique for DC-DC step-up conversion and 
high-efficiency regulation. In this 2-stage MPSC, 2 
voltage doublers are connected in series for boosting 
voltage gain up to 4 at most. For improving efficiency, 
the VPC is suggested to realize variable multiphase 
operation by changing phase number and topological 
path according to the desired output voltage so as to 
obtain the more suitable level of voltage gain. Besides, 
PWM is adopted for the better output regulation to 
compensate the dynamic error between the practical 
and desired outputs. Further, the relevant theoretical 
analysis includes: MPSC model, steady-state analysis, 
power efficiency, voltage conversion ratio. Finally, the 
closed-loop VPC-PWM-based MPSC is simulated, 
and all the results are illustrated to show the efficacy 
of the proposed scheme

I.  INTRODUCTION 
An SC converter, possessed of the power stage based 
on the structure of charge pump, is one of the good 
solutions to low-power DC-DC conversion because it has 
semiconductor switches and capacitors only. Unlike 
traditional ones, it needs no magnetic element, so SC 
converter always has light weight, small volume, and low 
EMI. A charge pump SC converter is usually designed 
for an output higher than times the voltage of supply or a 
reverse-polarity voltage. Such a step-up/reverse function 
is suitable for many applications, e.g. op-amp power, 
flash EEPROM, LED, fluorescent lamp, and LCD drivers. 
Up to now, various SC types have been suggested for 
power conversion, and some well-known ones are: (i) 
Dickson charge pump, (ii) Ioinovici converter, and (iii) 
Makowski charge pump. In 1976, Dickson charge pump 
was proposed based on a diode-chain structure with 2-
phase operation via pumping capacitors [1]. It provides 
voltage gain proportional to the stage number of pumping 
capacitor, and the detailed dynamic model and efficiency 
analysis are discussed [2-3]. But, its drawbacks include 
the fixed voltage gain and the larger device area. In 1993, 
Ioinovici et al. suggested a voltage-mode SC with two 
symmetrical capacitor cells working complementarily [4], 
and PWM was used for output regulation enhancement 
[5-6]. Based on this, Chang proposed an integrated SC 
step- up/down DC-DC/DC-AC converter [7-8]. However, 
Ioinovici SC still has voltage gain just proportional to the 
number of pumping capacitors, so it could need the larger 
device area for the high voltage gain asked. 
In 1997, Makowski suggested a canonical structure of 
multiplier charge pump with cascaded voltage doublers 
[9]. By 2-phase operation, an n-stage Makowski charge 
pump can obtain the voltage gain limited by the (n+1)-th 
Fibonacci number. In the 2-phase converters, it has been 
proved just to require the least number of pumping 
capacitors, and steady-state analysis, voltage/power loss 
were discussed [10- 11]. In 2001, Starzyk proposed a new 
charge pump scheme, called multiphase voltage doubler, 
where multiphase operation was employed different from 
2-phase before [12]. Its relevant performance limits are 
discussed, and the relationship (voltage gain and phase 
number) was presented by generalized Fibonacci number 
[13-14]. An n-stage Starzyk charge pump has voltage 
gain of n2  at most. In other words, the number of 
pumping capacitors in Starzyk is required fewer than that 
in Makowski for the same voltage gain. Nevertheless, 
some improved spaces still exist as follows. (i) Since 
Starzyk multiphase operation is fixed, the voltage gain is 
also fixed. It often results in the bad efficiency, especially 
for the lower output voltage. For improving efficiency, 
VPC is suggested here to realize variable multiphase 
operation to change phase number and MPSC topology 
for the more suitable level of voltage gain. (ii) Since 
Starzyk circuit scheme is fixed, the output regulation 
capability is limited. For enhancing the output regulation, 
PWM is adopted here to compensate the error between 
the practical and desired outputs. 
 
II.  CONFIGURATION OF 2-STAGE MPSC 
Fig. 1 shows a closed-loop scheme of 2-stage MPSC, 
and it contains 2 major parts: “power part” and “control 
part”. The power part in the upper half of Fig. 1 is called 
2-stage MPSC, which is based on Starzyk charge pump 
[12], and it is composed of 2 cascaded voltage doublers 
in series between source SV  and output oV . For more 
details, it includes 2 pumping capacitors 21,CC , 1 buffer/ 
output capacitor o,CC3 , 8 MOSFET switches ...21 ,,SS 8S , 
and 1 PWM switch PWMS , where each capacitor has the

(LPF), PWM, and variable-phase generator. From the 
view of signal flow, ov  is sent into LPF for high-
frequency noise rejection. Then, the filtered oV  is 
compared with the desired reference refV  to produce D  
via PWM block. The goal is to keep oV  on following 
refV  for enhancing output regulation. Besides, VPC is 
suggested to realize “variable” multiphase operation for 
improving power efficiency, especially for the lower 
output voltage. The idea of VPC is to change phase 
number p  and topological path according to the desired 
output for the more suitable level of voltage gain. In 2-
stage MPSC, based on 4x operation as above, other 
multiphase operations for 1x,2x,3x can be also obtained 
as presented in Table 1, where all operations of 1S - 8S  
are listed. With digital programmable chip/frequency 
divider, the variable-phase generator can be designed for 
realizing VPC idea, and it needs to do 2 things as follows. 
(i) The generator has to determine a phase number with 
Gaussp ]VV[ So  ( 4 3, 2, ,1p ) according to the desired 
output. (ii) Based on this p , the generator has to generate 
the signals 1S - 8S  (Table 1) so as to change topology for 
the more suitable voltage gain (1x,2x,3x,4x). Thus, VPC 
can be performed by this variable-phase generator. 
 
III.  FORMULATION OF 2-STAGE MPSC 
 Now, let’s start with the formulation of 4x MPSC. 
First, let’s start with the formulation of 4x MPSC. Based 
on the topologies in Fig. 3(a)-(c), the dynamic equations 
in Phase I~IV are derived. And then, by taking average of 
them,5,7 the state equation within PWM ON-time can be 
obtained as:

V.  EXAMPLE OF 2-STAGE MPSC 
 A closed-loop 2-stage MPSC with VPC-PWM control 
is designed and simulated by OrCAD tool (PSPICE), and 
all the results are illustrated to verify the efficacy of the 
proposed scheme. First, according to the proposed 
scheme in Fig. 1, the closed-loop MPSC is designed by 
PSPICE for circuit simulation. The main function is to 
boost up output oV  to 4 times voltage of source SV  
( V6.3 ) at most for supplying the standard load LR  
( 600 ). In the controller, cut-off frequency Lw  is set on 
1000Hz for high-frequency noise rejection, and PWM 
proportional gain PK  is assigned to 12. Further, other 
parameters are included as: kHz200Sf , kHz20PWMf , 
)0.01 ESR(1  FC  , FCo 20 ,  2.04800:PMOSFET , 
and  2.09600:NMOSFET . The two cases are discussed 
as: (i) steady-state output, output ripple and power 
efficiency, and (ii) output ripple and power efficiency for 
various outputs. 
 (i) Let’s consider the steady-state response. Now, the 
closed-loop MPSC is simulated for 4 desired refV = 
V0.14 / V6.10 / V1.7 / V3.3  (assigned arbitrarily), and then 
the results of output voltage and ripple are obtained as 
shown in Fig. 5-8. In Fig. 5(a)/6(a)/7(a)/8(a), it is found 
that the 4x/3x/2x/1x MPSC are at the stable work on step-
up conversion, and all the steady-state values oV  are 
following the 4 desired refV  after passing the settling time 
of ms2 . In Fig. 5(b)/6(b)/7(b)/8(b), the output ripples are 
measured as: rp %059.0 / %0283.0 / %2336.0 / 
%338.0 , and the power efficiencies are obtained as: 
 %88.95 / %96.97 / %40.97 / %94.91  under using 
VPC. Truly, the results correspond to the theoretical 
conclusion of power efficiency of (14)-(17). As above, 
the results show that the MPSC has good steady-state 
performances. Now, if VPC is not adopted and the MPSC 
is operated for the “fixed” 4p  (4x MPSC), then the 
efficiencies for the 4 different refV  are obtained as: 
 %88.95 / %11.72 / %02.48 / %07.21 . Obviously, 
without VPC, the efficiencies for the lower output 
voltage become worse. 
 (ii) The output ripple and power efficiency are 
discussed for  the various desired outputs. With 
consideration of the standard LR  of 600  and the 
desired refV  from V0.1  to 14.0V , the output ripple and 
power efficiency are arranged as shown in Fig. 9(a)-(b). 
In Fig. 9(a), it is obvious that all the output ripples are 
lower than %8.0 . In Fig. 9(b), the bold line represents 
the efficiency   with VPC for various outputs oV . 
Really, its curve shape includes 4 divisions. The results 
correspond to (14)-(17). And then, the dotted line in Fig. 
9(b) is the efficiency   without VPC for various outputs 
oV . The efficiency without VPC is a sloping line, and it 
is rising with increasing oV . By comparing the two 
curves, it is obvious that   with VPC is much better than 
  without VPC, especially for the lower output voltage

Two-Stage Multiphase Switched-Capacitor  Converter with Variable-
Phase and PWM Control

same C  with equivalent series resistance (ESR) Cr  
( CCCC  321 ), and the output capacitor has 
capacitance oC , and all MOSFETs are operated as static 
switches with the on-state resistance Tr . 
 Firstly, let’s discuss 2-stage MPSC operation. The 
phase number p  is selected no more than 422   
( 4or  2,3,,1p ). Here, for the good of explanation, p  is 
temporarily assigned to 4, i.e. the maximum voltage gain 
will be 4 (4x). Fig. 2 shows the theoretical waveforms of 
4x MPSC within one PWM cycle PWMT  ( PWMPWM fT 1 , 
PWMf : PWM frequency). One PWMT  contains ON/OFF-
time intervals for PWMS . The PWM ON-time interval is 
PWMTD  , and OFF-time interval is PWMTD  )1( , where 
D  is the duty cycle of PWMT  ( 10  D ). And then, ST  is 
the MPSC cycle which is the inverse of MPSC frequency 
Sf  ( SS fT 1 ). ST  contains 4 phases Phase I,II,III,IV, 
and each phase has the same phase cycle T  ( 8STT  ). 
As shown in Fig. 2, one PWMT  has 10 ST  here. Actually, 
for the better response, PWMT  can be taken at over 10 
times value of ST , i.e. 10PWMS TT  . Now, Phase I-IV 
operations within PWM ON-time interval are as follows. 
 
 
(a) Phase I, III 
 
(b) Phase II 
 
(c) Phase IV

(c) Phase IV 
Fig. 4. Topologies within PWM OFF-time interval 
 
(i) Phase I ( ] [ 10 t,tt  ): 1S , 2S , PWMS  turn on. Then, the 
Phase I topology is shown in Fig. 3(a): 1Cv  across 1C  is 
charged up to SV , and 3C , oC  are discharged to supply 
LR . (ii) Phase II ( ] [ 21 t,tt  ): 3S , 4S , 5S , 6S , PWMS  turn on. 
The Phase II topology is in Fig. 3(b): 2Cv  across 2C  is 
charged by SV , 1Cv  in series, and 3C , oC  are still 
discharged to supply LR . (iii) Phase III ( ] [ 32 t,tt  ): it 
repeats Phase I operation. (iv) Phase IV ( ] [ 43 t,tt ): 3S , 
4S , 7S , 8S , PWMS  turn on. The Phase IV topology is in Fig. 
3(c): 3C , oC  are charged by the series connection of SV , 
1Cv , 2Cv  to supply LR . Next, let’s consider Phase I-IV 
operations within PWM-OFF interval. In fact, they are 
similar to the operations with PWN-ON interval but 
turning off PWMS . Thus, the Phase I-IV topologies are 
obtained as shown in Fig. 4(a)-(c). Obviously, ov  is 
regulated relative to how long PWMTD   is. Since 1Cv / 2Cv  
is charged to the goal values of SV / S2V , ov  will be 
boosted up to 4 times of SV  at most. 
 Secondly, the VPC-PWM controller is shown in the 
lower half of Fig. 1, which is composed of low-pass filter

 Next, let’s look at the steady-state analysis of 4x 
MPSC. By substituting 0' x  of (3), the steady-state 
output voltage oV , output current oI , and supply-
terminal current SI  can be

If 0D , then 04x M . If 1D , then 4xM  is close to 4 
when TL rR  , Cr . For nominal conditions, the maximum 
attainable output oV  is SV4 voltage drops in the 
charging/discharging circuits. For the better conversion 
ratio, LR  is asked much larger than Tr , Cr . In fact, LR  is 
about in  -level, and Tr , Cr  is about in m -level. By 
the same process, the voltage conversion ratios of 3x/2x/ 
1x MPSC can be also derived as (10)-(12).

From (14), it is obvious that 4x  is rising when oV  is 
desired as close to S4V  as possible. On the contrary, if 
So V4V  , then the efficiency will be quite bad. The 
situation often appears in the lower desired output voltage. 
To improve the efficiency, VPC is suggested to realize 
variable multiphase operation (Table 1), and it can 
change phase number p and topological path according to 
the desired output so as to obtain the more suitable level 
of voltage gain. In other words, VPC has 4 different 
levels ( S4V / SV3 / SV2 / SV1 ) to choose from for fitting oV  
as close as possible. For example, SV  is 3.6V , and the 
maximum output can be boosted up to 14.4V . Now, the 
desired oV  is just at 7V . If the 4x MPSC is running, then 
the best efficiency will not be higher than 48.6% via (14). 
In the 3x MPSC, the best efficiency is about 64.8% via 
(15). But, if the 2x MPSC is adopted now, then the best 
efficiency is improved up to 97.2% via (16). The reason 
is that S2V  is close to the desired oV = 7V  most now. So, 
VPC can improve the efficiency, especially for the lower 
output voltage. 
 
C.  Output ripple percentage 
 According to Fig. 2, ov  is exponentially decaying 
from max o,V  to min o,V  within PWM OFF-time, and ov  
can be expressed as: 
PWM
t
o TDtetv )1(0  ,V)( maxo, 
  ,                       (18) 
where the maximum/minimum value within PWMTD)(1  
is denoted by max o,V / min o,V , defined by )0(V maxo, ov , 
))1((V mino, PWMo TDv  , and oLCR  is the discharging 
time constant. Thus, the output ripple variation can be 
defined as:

Obviously, rp  is worse while the load is heavier, but it 
can be improved by increasing PWMf  or oC . Clearly, 
when MPSC is unloaded ( LR ), rp  is almost zero.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS 
 A closed-loop 2-stage MPSC is proposed by 
combining VPC and PWM for DC-DC step-up 
conversion and high- efficiency output regulation. For 
improving the efficiency, VPC is suggested to realize 
variable multiphase operation by changing phase number 
and topological path according to the desired output so as 
to obtain the more suitable level of voltage gain. Besides, 
PWM is adopted to enhance the output regulation for 
different desired output. The advantages of the proposed 
scheme are as follows. (i) The MPSC needs no magnetic 
element, so I.C. fabrication will be promising future. (ii) 
This MPSC can obtain the high voltage gain by the least 
number of pumping capacitors, so it will save the device 
area. (iii) By using VPC here, the power efficiency can be 
improved much better than that just by the fixed phase 
operation, especially for the lower output voltage.

本計畫以多級多重相位電壓倍壓轉換電路(Multiple-stage Multiple-phase 
Voltage Doubler, MPVD)為主體架構，配合脈寬/頻率調變(PWM/PFM)技術，在電
流/電壓模式控制的考量下，整合設計出一高效率之升壓轉換器/逆轉器(DC-DC 
converter/DC-AC inverter)，並且已完成雛型電路實作測試、及相關控制晶片之
下線製作(國家晶片製程中心 CIC，下線晶片編號：D35-98B-92e、D35-98C-78e)。
 
1.在學術研究方面，本計劃採用多重相位多級式切換式電容架構為基礎，隨後依
據光源負載 WLED/ EL 需求的輕重，在寬幅輸入電源的考量下，使用 PWM 或 PFM 補
償進行調整亮度及增益，以期達成更高的轉換效率。其中相關控制晶片部份以 CIC 
Full-custom Layout來達成實際設計。 
2.在實際應用方面，本計畫研發一套 DC-DC/DC-AC 轉換電路雛型架構，如此可以
提供做為未來晶片實作時的理論與原型設計之基礎，且本計畫已將其晶片實現完
成(CIC 國家晶片製程中心)，藉以提升產學界對電源轉換系統晶片開發之興趣與技
術水準，並強化可攜式電子產品之競爭力。
