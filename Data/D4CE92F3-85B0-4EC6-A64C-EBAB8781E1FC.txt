11、前言
隨著文明進展，人類愈需要能源以推動工業生產與民生應用。二十世紀能源主要來源為
石油、煤、天然氣等礦物燃料(fossil fuels)，然而由於地球上的礦藏量有限以及人類過渡使用，
已經使得來源逐漸枯竭。人類於數十年前即感受到礦物燃料來源枯竭的嚴重性，因此早已投
入研究替代能源，且由於最近兩年石油價格高漲使得能源成本急劇提高，今年石油價格一度
突破每桶 90 美元，短時間內能源的價格高漲已造成人類生活品質，長期而言，能源潰乏將威
脅人類文明，因此新的能源科技益形重要。
最近幾年能源成本與能源需求急劇提高，燃料電池、太陽能電池、風力等新的能源科技成
為重要替代能源。燃料電池為近來廣受注意的替代能源之一，其原理為採用電化學轉化方式
將氫氣或碳氫化物與氧氣反應，直接以電能輸出，其能源轉化效率比燃燒方式要高。燃料電
池目前已可發展為小型電源以及發電廠級的大型設施，而其使用之材料與材料間搭配組成皆
影響實質能量輸出效率，因而為目前能源材料研究之重要課題。
2、研究目的
本子計畫研究以薄膜技術製做適用於固態氧化物燃料電池之陶金(cermet)陽極，並規劃與
其他計畫整合共同完成燃料電池系統。本計畫先以鎳—釔安定型氧化鋯之陶金組成為標準陽
極材料，研究使用薄膜技術與氫氣還原技術形成具有奈米等級孔隙的電極薄膜，並建立此技
術為後續研究的技術平台。具有奈米等級孔隙的電極薄膜將優於傳統以燒結法形成的，孔隙
尺寸為數微米的電極，因為奈米等級孔隙可以提高單位電極面積之三相界面，降低反應極化
損耗，提高燃料電池輸出效率。依據前述新開發的技術，將所開發出的奈米孔隙鎳—釔安定
型氧化鋯之陶金陽極用於固態氧化物燃料電池，並建立單氣室式量測系統以及雙氣室量測系
統測試，分析薄膜電極用於固態氧化物燃料電池的效能。同時以提高薄膜陶金陽極之可靠度
與發電效率為出發點，本計畫研究以鎳—銅—氧化鋯—氧化鈰組合為陶金材料，以期適用於
碳氫燃料環境的高效率且抗碳化陽極。本計畫開發多孔性薄膜陶金陽極，預期未來可以與薄
膜電解質結合，做為低阻抗-高能源轉換效率的燃料電池。
3、文獻探討
固態氧化物燃料電池(SOFC, solid oxide fuel cell)使用具有氧離子穿透能力的氧化物為固
態電解質，兩側電極分別曝露於燃料氣氛與氧氣氣氛，使氧氣於陰極還原為氧離子並進入電
解質，接著氧離子擴散穿過電解質，最後在電解質與陽極界面氧與燃料於進行電化學氧化，
據以將化學能轉化成電能[1]。
圖 3.1、固態氧化物燃料電池的示意圖
固態氧化物燃料電池的電解質為一種具有高的氧離子穿透率的材料，氧離子經由氧化物
3程中可能遇到因電極減薄造成有效三相界面減少的問題，使電池極化損耗變高[8]。跟據文獻
[9,10]的研究，如果增加單位區域三相界面，將可補償因厚度減少造成的極化損耗。本實驗室
先前於研究氧氣感測器時開發了以薄膜技術製做多孔性鉑電極的技術[11]，可以形成具有奈米
孔隙純金屬薄膜，本計畫則進一步將此技術應用於製成多孔性陶金電極，並製成固態氧化物燃
料電池與量測特性，並與傳統厚膜技術製作的電極比較。
4、研究方法
4.1. Ni-YSZ、Ni-CeO2-YSZ 薄膜陶金電極研製
本計畫使用反應式共濺鍍與熱還原程序形成多孔性 Ni-YSZ 或是 Ni-CeO2-YSZ 陶金陽極。
共濺鍍系統如圖 4.1 [12]所示:以兩支陰極分別濺鍍鎳靶材與鋯釔混合靶，或是鎳靶材與鋯釔
鈰混合靶，濺鍍過程中通入氬氣與氧氣以形成複合氧化物膜，基座並加以旋轉以便形成均勻
成份與厚度的膜，以及將基材座加熱以增加膜與基材界面的附著力。

圖 4.1. 共濺鍍系統示意圖[12]
再將濺鍍所得之複合氧化物薄膜置於石英管爐中，於真空環境中熱還原或是於稀氫氣氛中熱
還原，使複合氧化物薄膜中的氧化鎳還原成鎳，但保持釔安定型氧化鋯或是鈰摻雜釔安定型
氧化鋯為氧化物狀態。
4.2. 固態氧化物燃料電池
燃料電池元件採用陰極-電解質-陽極的三明治式結構，於 8YSZ 碟型基材兩側分別鍍上陽
極與陰極，再濺鍍薄的白金網罩以提高電子流分散與收集能力。陰極製作方式為將錳酸鍶鑭
(La0.7Sr0.3MnO3) 以網印方式塗佈至 8YSZ 基材上，再予以燒結形成；陽極則採用段落 4.1 之
反應式共濺鍍再加熱還原程序製做多孔性 Ni-YSZ 或是 Ni-CeO2-YSZ 陶金。本計畫也製備使
用厚膜 Ni-YSZ 陽極之燃料電池參考品，以及製作三層薄膜陽極的試片以進行燃料電池效率
比較。
形成燃料電池所需之碟型釔安定型氧化鋯電解質採用陶瓷燒結製作，選用含 8 mol%Y2O3
的 ZrO2(8YSZ)為電解質成份，將採購來之粉末置於不銹鋼模具並以萬能試驗機施壓成碟型基
材，再置於高溫爐中於 1500°C 燒結三小時，待爐冷至室溫後取出。
本計畫建立單氣室式系統與雙氣室系統量測電池之極化曲線，於 700°C 至 800°C 間採用混
合氣(CH4:Air=29.4:70.6)外加約 3%水氣量測，或是以氫氣為燃料，量測並分析電池的最大輸

5.3. 單氣室式燃料電池量測系統建立
本子計畫為了測試所發展的多孔性陶金薄膜用於燃料電池的性能，乃做成平面碟型的燃
料電池，並以掃瞄電流量測電壓的方式分析燃料電池。雖然高效率的燃料電池採雙氣室式量
測，但由於所需的高溫封合技術不易，因此本研究乃以先以單氣室式量測。單氣室式量測乃
將燃料電池置放於一個混合燃料與空氣的氣氛中，並控制於穩定的高溫環境操作，因此我們
將所製成的燃料電池置於如圖 5.5 的石英載具，再放置於石英管爐中操作。燃料電池的陰極
與陽極分別於兩個面，並以金導線連接至真空電極連接頭(Vacuum feedthrough)，再經空氣端
接頭連接至電源電表，為了固定導線並避免短路，乃以中間設計好開口之 S310 不銹鋼製具以
及雲母片固定碟型燃料電池。整組石英載具連同導線接頭設計為獨立組件，可以由管爐側面
接頭伸入爐體中央進行恆溫與變溫之電流量-電壓量測。

5.4. 雙氣室式燃料電池量測系統建立
圖 5.6、(a)雙氣室式燃料電池量測系統與(b)不銹鋼製電池載具
本計畫進行於第三年度自行裝設了雙氣室式燃料電池量測系統，以便研究所開發之多孔性

微鏡觀察之表面輪廓，初始 NiO-8YSZ 鍍膜為細小顆粒聚集成類花椰菜(cauliflower-like)結
構，符合一般低溫鍍膜的表面型態。經過 900°C 空氣中退火的 NiO-8YSZ 膜的晶粒長大至數
十奈米，與 XRD 較佳結晶化的結果相穩合。再經過 800°C 還原得到的 Ni-YSZ 膜的晶粒尺寸
縮小，同時出現數十奈米的孔隙，成為奈米多孔性陶金膜。

圖 5.9、NiO-YSZ 薄膜於(a)鍍膜、(b)結晶化與(c)還原成 Ni-YSZ 的表面型態
經由圖 5.8 的 XRD 分析與圖 5.9 的表面型態分析，我們可以由所規劃的材製料程獲得具
有奈米尺度孔隙的 Ni-YSZ 陶金薄膜，並可以於計畫中用於燃料電池的陽極。因此我們已建
立奈米尺度多孔性陶金薄膜的製程平台，此製作方式也用於開發未來將延續至 Ni-YSZ-CeO2
奈米多孔性陶金膜，應用於燃料電池的陽極。
5.6. 平面型燃料電池之單氣室量測
本計畫以開發薄膜陽極為目標，並將薄膜陽極用於 Ni-YSZ/YSZ/LSMO 燃料電池元件測
試，同時另以使用厚膜 Ni-YSZ 陽極的燃料電池為參考樣品，將兩個樣品以相同量測條件比
較。圖 5.10 為兩個燃料電池的 V-I 與 P-I 曲線，樣品於單氣室式系統通入 29.4 sccm CH4 與 70.6
sccm Air 以及約 3%水氣量測，量測溫度介於 600°C 與 800°C 之間，而此處比較的數據為於
700°C 量測的樣品。本研究中以單層薄膜 Ni-YSZ 為陽極的燃料電池之最大輸出功率為 0.38
mW cm-2，而以厚膜 Ni-YSZ 為陽極的參考樣品為 0.76 mW cm-2。初步得到的結果驗證以本計
畫規劃的薄膜陶金陽極可進行電化學氧氣還原反應，且應用於單氣室式量測環境中具有觸媒
選擇性，可促成 CH4與 H2O 重組為 CO 與 H2 燃料，並進行電化學氧化反應，促成燃料電池
輸出電力。另一方面，單層薄膜 Ni-YSZ 比厚膜 Ni-YSZ 電極的輸出功率低，其原因仍待探討。
圖 5.10、以 Ni-YSZ 薄膜(●)與厚膜(▲)為陽極之燃料電池於單氣室與甲烷燃料的 V-I 與 P-I 分析
本計畫另以一個三層薄膜陽極的燃料電池試片進行溫度與時間變化對電池效能之影響，
結果如圖 5.11。於 600°C 至 800°C 區間量測電池之 V-I 曲線，再經計算所得的 P-I 曲線中所求
得最大功率密度隨溫度變化的情形，約於 680°C 達到最高的 0.51 mW cm-2，升高溫度則造成
95.8. 鎳奈米線成長
圖 5.13、於 NiO-YSZ 薄膜表面形成的 Ni 奈米柱
本計畫進行中一方面尋求簡化製程，一方面開發新穎的電極微結構，過程中得到如圖 5.13
的鎳奈米線。此處使用類似圖 5.1 的技術平台，首先以共濺鍍法製作 NiO-YSZ 混合氧化物薄
膜，接著於 Ar-20% H2 氣份中熱處理，結果於薄膜表層成長出鎳奈米線。此處的鎳奈米線可
能尚無法直接應用於燃料電池的電極，但是預期與總計畫主持人周振嘉教授發展的 YSZ 奈米
線整合之後，便可以做為高效率燃料電池的陽極。
5.9. 網狀銅膜
圖 5.14、(a)以熱氧化形成的 CuO 奈米線與(b)還原後得到的網狀銅結構的型態
本計畫尚無法將銅以如圖 5.1 的技術平台製作成多孔性 Cu-CeO2-YSZ 陶金膜，因此構思
其他方式製作銅基的多孔性陶金薄膜。圖 5.14 的掃瞄式電子顯微鏡影像為本計畫開發的另一
種技術平台，以奈米氧化物為原料，再於轉化形成網狀金屬。將來我們將使用此網狀銅金屬
製作銅基的多孔性陶金，並用於燃料電池的陽極。
5.10. 論文發表與專利申請
本計畫部分成果已整理並撰寫為學術論文並投稿與發表於國際學術期刊，參與學生也完
成三份碩士論文以及發表於國內研討會。目前仍有一位同學將再完成投稿國際論文與完成碩

1. INTRODUCTION
One-dimensional nanostructures, including nanotubes, nanowires, nanorods and nanocones of
diverse materials, have been receiving extensive interest due to their unique properties.1,2 A great
many of techniques have been developed to produce a wide range of nano-scaled structures, from
carbon nanotubes to oxides and to metallic and semiconductor nanostructures.1-4 Several
processes have been developed on producing metallic nanowires and nanorods.1,2 However, these
processes involve multiple steps and require many facilities. This paper provides a simple but
versatile approach to generate metallic nanorods.
The processes used for producing metallic nanowires or nanorods include using nanoporous
materials or carbon nanotubes as templates for growing metallic nanowires,1,2 using a polyol or a
micellar medium for forming one-dimensional precursors and then reducing the precursors for
making metallic nanowires, using chemical and hydrothermal reduction of precursors in solutions,
and using H2 reduction of dry precursors.2 Also, metallic nanowires, especially Zn nanowires,
were generated by condensing vapor to solid (VS),5,6 while direct deposition of Ag nanorods was
achieved by employing an oblique angle deposition of Ag with self-shadowed effect.7
Furthermore, metal nanowires have been generated by surface treatment of bulk metal. Lee et al.8
treated a W film in a mixture of H2 and Ar at 850 °C to generate W nanowires by means of a
self-catalyzed reaction, while trace of O2 would help forming W nanowires, but oxide nanowires
would be generated in the presence of O2 gas.9,10 W nanowires were also generated by depositing
tungsten oxide above oxide’s decomposition temperature.11
In this paper, as an alternative, we present a simple method in the generation of nickel nanorods
without a template or an intermediate step as compared to those techniques discussed above in the
forming of metallic nanorods. The Ni nanorods were directly obtained by annealing the NiO-YSZ
composite films in H2 at 800 °C. This method is expected to be used to prepare other metallic
nanorods, facilitating a variety of applications.
2. EXPERIMENT
The original NiO-YSZ composite film was created by a mixture of NiO and CeO2-doped YSZ,
which were deposited on thermal-oxide-coated Si(100) substrates by using reactive co-sputtering of
a Ni and a Zr-Y-Ce targets in a gas mixture of argon (10 sccm) and oxygen (10 sccm). Working and
base pressures for the sputtering process were 2.4 Pa and 6.7×10-4 Pa, respectively. The composite
oxide film was then annealed in 20 vol.% H2-80 vol.% Ar in a quartz tube furnace at 800 °C for 1 h.
H2 reduction was employed to convert NiO-YSZ to Ni-YSZ. However, Ni nanorods were
produced on surface of the films.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Morphology and structure of the as-deposited (Fig. 1a) and annealed films (Fig. 1b) were first
inspected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As-deposited composite oxide film has
dense columnar structure, as shown in Fig. 1(a), while Fig. 1(b) shows nanorods are grown on the
top of a porous film after annealing. These nanorods are 45 to 140 nm in width and 230 nm to 1.4
m in length. Grains of 60 to 200 nm in size are also present on surface of the porous film.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was also used to study the composition and crystal structure of the
nanostructures after and before annealing. XRD spectra were taken at a glancing angle of 5°. As
shown in the upper XRD spectra in Fig. 2, the nanorod-containing film is composed of Ni and YSZ
phases, while the lower one is the XRD spectra of the as-deposited films. The as-deposited oxide
film has low crystallinity, and two broad peaks should represent NiO (111) and (200) reflections in a
stressed state. According to the XRD spectra, NiO in the composite oxide film is reduced to form
Ni crystals, while the YSZ remains as oxide, after the H2-annealing. Ni nanorods on the surface of

1. Introduction
Planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been developed for potential use in portable power
devices [1-5]. SOFCs have a sandwiched cathode/electrolyte/anode structure. The power
efficiency of fuel cells depends on the resistive and polarization losses that generally are incurred in
the fuel cells. Reducing the thickness of the electrolyte increases the power efficiency and reduces
the operating temperature of the SOFCs because of the reduction of the resistive loss across the
electrolyte [1]. Using a porous cermet electrode with a large three-phase-boundary (TPB) can
reduce the loss of activation polarization and improve cell performance [6]. The porous structure
of the cermet electrodes facilitates electrochemical reactions at the TPB where the gases, electrolyte
and the electrode meet [7]. Conventional SOFCs use dense yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) as the
electrolyte, porous nickel (Ni)-YSZ cermet as the anode, and porous strontium-doped lanthanum
manganite (LSM) as the cathode [1]. Two stack structures are used in the planar SOFCs [8].
One is that of the electrolyte-supported SOFC and comprises an electrolyte disc of thickness of 50
to 150μm, with the two sides coated separately with anode and cathode films. The other is that of
the electrode-supported SOFC comprising a thick anode or cathode disc with a thickness of a few
hundred micrometers, and an electrolyte film with a thickness of 5 to 20μm.
In electrolyte-supported SOFCs, the thick porous Ni-YSZ anodes are fabricated by the screen
printing, tape casting or spray coating of mixtures of NiO and YSZ powders, followed by sintering
in air and further reduction in diluted hydrogen [2,4,8,9]. Large YSZ powders are used in the
NiO-YSZ ink or slurry to produce a rigid porous microstructure of the Ni-YSZ anode with large
grains following sintering. The size of the pores thus produced in the Ni-YSZ anode is in the
micrometer range, allowing gases to diffuse through. Yet the Ni-YSZ anode with large YSZ grains
reduces the TPB length and causes a loss of electrochemical activity because of the agglomeration
of Ni particles at high temperatures [10-12]. The issue of the Ni agglomeration can be minimized
by introducing fine YSZ particles in the Ni-YSZ anode [13]. A stable, high-performance porous
Ni-YSZ anode has been produced using a mixture of coarse (tens of micrometers) and fine (below
one micrometer) particles, to form an entangled YSZ frame and Ni network with large TPB [14].
Various approaches have been employed to increase the TPB and to improve the performance of
SOFCs by modifying the porous microstructure with nano-sized substances [15-21]. For instance,
cermet anodes can be produced by impregnating a porous Ni frame with ceramic precursors or
nano-sized suspensions, or by impregnating a porous YSZ frame with precursors of metal salts,
followed by post-annealing [15-17]. A high-efficiency cermet anode with a nano-sized
microstructure can also be obtained by sintering NiO-YSZ core-shell powders [18] or nano-sized
composite powders [19-21].
In anode-supported SOFCs, a thick porous Ni-YSZ cermet is employed to provide the
mechanical strength for the cell. Slow gas flow through thick Ni-YSZ may cause concentration
polarization if the electrode comprises small grains and pores. Multi-layered Ni-YSZ anodes with
gradients of composition and microstructure have been used in SOFCs to provide a supporting
substrate layer with large grains and pores, and a functional layer with small grains and pores
[22-25]. The thin anode functional layer (AFL) comes into contact with the electrolyte and
provides abundant TPB. The thick anode substrate layer (ASL) provides high porosity for gas
diffusion, thus reducing the concentration polarization. Meanwhile, the ASL contains many large
Ni particles to ensure good electrical contact [24]. Anode-supported SOFCs use a thinner
electrolyte than electrolyte-supported SOFCs, which electrolyte has lower resistive loss. Basu et
al. [23] studied anode-supported SOFCs with a thin Ni-YSZ AFL of about 5μm thick and a thick
ASL of about 1.5 mm thick. The SOFCs could be operated at an intermediate temperature of
under 800 °C by using a 5μm-thick YSZ electrolyte and a 50μm-thick LSM cathode on top of the
supporting anode.
Dense YSZ electrolyte films with a thickness of under 5μm have been used in SOFCs, using
colloidal spray [26] and various vacuum deposition approaches [27], such as e-beam evaporation
[28], sputtering [29-33], pulsed laser deposition (PLD) [5] and polarized electrochemical vapor
23
turbomolecular pump to a base pressure of 2.6×10-3 Pa. Argon (99.999%) flow at 20 sccm and
oxygen (99.999%) flow at 20 sccm were then introduced into the system, and a working pressure of
2.66 Pa was maintained during the depositions. The substrates were physically placed on a
stainless steel holder that was heated by quartz lamps from its backside to 350 °C. The surface
temperature of the substrate was measured by mechanically attaching thermocouple wires in a
separated experiment. The surface temperature of the substrate was raised to about 410 °C by the
transfer of additional plasma energy during sputtering the Zr-Y target at an RF power of 100 W.
The holder was rotated at 3 rev. min-1 to yield NiO-YSZ films of uniform composition and
thickness. The NiO-YSZ films were then annealed in air at 900°C for 1.5 h to improve their
crystallinity. Then, the annealed NiO-YSZ samples were decomposed into Ni-YSZ in a quartz
tube furnace at 800 °C for 2 h. The quartz tube furnace was pumped using an oil-typed
mechanical pump to a pressure of 2.66 Pa during the decomposition.
The structures of the as-deposited, post-annealed and the decomposed films on top of the
oxide-coated Si (100) substrates were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku
DMAX-B, Japan) with Cu-Kαradiation. The XRD measurements were made in the
Bragg-Brentano (BB) set-up using a step-scan mode. The chemical structures of the as-deposited
films were elucidated by analyzing the binding energies of Ni, Zr and Y using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCA Scientific, USA) with Al-Kαradiation. XPS data of the samples
were corrected using the C 1s peak energy at 284.6 eV. Before the XPS spectra were obtained, the
surfaces of the samples were cleaned by Ar+ bombardment in an ultrahigh vacuum. The surface
morphology and cross section of the films were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM,
JEOL JSM6500F, Japan). For cross-sectional examination, the samples were cleaved rather than
cut to prevent damage to their microstructure. The chemical compositions of the films were
obtained using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS, INCA Energy 300, Oxford Instruments, UK)
in the SEM. The acceleration voltage of the electron beam was 25 kV for EDS acquisition.
Ni-Kαand Zr-Lαlines were selected to analyze the chemical compositions of the films herein.
Planar Ni-YSZ/YSZ/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 stacks were fabricated to test the performance of the
SOFCs. Thin and thick porous Ni-YSZ films were used as anodes, whereas a thick porous
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 film was used as a cathode in an YSZ electrolyte-supported SOFC. The thin anode
film was prepared using the previously mentioned sputtering and annealing procedures. The thick
Ni-YSZ film was prepared by screen printing technique. Commercial YSZ powder (HSY-8,
Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo, Japan) with an average diameter of 0.59μm was used to prepare
the electrolyte discs. Around 0.3 g of the YSZ powder was pressed into a die of 15 mm in
diameter at 80 MPa at room temperature for 3 min to form a YSZ compact. Then, the YSZ
compact was sintered at 1500 °C for 3 h to produce electrolyte disc of 11.5 mm in diameter and 0.4
mm in thickness. Then, the anode and cathode were coated on two sides of the sintered YSZ disc.
Coating and heat treatment sequences began with a high-temperature process and to end with a
low-temperature process. For SOFC cells with thin Ni-YSZ anodes, the thick LSM cathode was
fabricated on one side of the YSZ disc first, and the Ni-YSZ films were formed on the other side in
the final step. The sintered YSZ disc was screen-printed using La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 paste, and then
sintered in air at 1100 °C for 2 h. The La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 paste was prepared by mixing 10 g of
La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 powder with 4 g of Terpineol 318 (Hercules, Germany) and 0.2 g of CR-300
(Hercules, Germany). The NiO-YSZ thin films were then deposited on the other side of the
LSM-coated 8YSZ discs and converted to porous Ni-YSZ anodes using previously mentioned
sputtering and annealing procedures. A reference cell with a thick Ni-YSZ anode was prepared by
screen printing to compare the performance of SOFCs. Since a sintering temperature as high as
1350 °C would be required to produce the thick NiO-YSZ film, the order of steps to produce the
reference cell were changed from that used to prepare the SOFC with the thin film electrode.
Otherwise, the porous LSM coating would begin to react with YSZ to form pyrochlore La2Zr2O7
above 1200 °C, which compound has a high resistance and no O2 reduction activity [41-43]. Here,
a thick NiO-YSZ (NiO:8YSZ=60:40 by weight) film was first screen-printed onto one side of the
sintered 8YSZ disc before it was sintered in air at 1350 °C for 2 h. Then, the La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 film
25
sputter deposition. The NiO phase in the NiO-YSZ films may experience similar stress state
causing angular positions of the NiO reflections shift to lower angles. Fig. 3b presents XRD
patterns of these NiO-YSZ films after they were annealed in air at 900 °C for 1.5 h. The
diffraction peaks of the NiO phase become strong and sharp in the annealed films, indicating
improving crystallinity. Positions of the diffraction peaks of the NiO phase agree with those for
the NiO standard [44]. New peaks at 2θvalues of 30.1°, 34.9°, 50.2° and 59.7°, which correspond
to the reflections of cubic 8YSZ(111), (200), (220) and (311) [53], are obtained from the annealed
films. It indicates that the crystalline 8YSZ phase is present in the films following annealing.
Therefore, the post-annealed films comprise NiO and YSZ phases. Fig. 3c presents XRD patterns
of the films after being annealed in a vacuum at 800 °C for 2h. The NiO peaks disappear, whereas
the new peaks that related to Ni(111) and (200) reflections [54] are present at 2θvalues of 44.5° and
51.9°, respectively. The YSZ (111), (200), (220) and (311) reflections are still obtained from the
films after they have being annealed in vacuum. Therefore, the NiO decomposed to form Ni but
the YSZ phase remained unchanged during annealing in a vacuum at 2.66 Pa. Therefore, the
NiO-YSZ films are transformed to Ni-YSZ cermet films that comprise crystallites and pores of tens
of nanometers in sizes (visualized in Fig. 1 and fig. 2) following vacuum annealing.
Fig. 4 presents XPS spectra of Zr, Y and Ni in the as-deposited films and their related nominal
peak positions, obtained from the literature. As presented in Fig. 4a, binding energies of the Zr
3d5/2 and 3d3/2 are centered at 182.4 eV and 184.8 eV, which agree closely with the Zr4+ state in
YSZ [55-57]. As presented in Fig. 4b, the binding energies of the Y 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 are around
157.6 eV and 159.6 eV, which are related to the Y3+ state in YSZ [56]. The binding energies of
both Zr and Y in the as-deposited films are the same as those in the crystalline YSZ. YSZ clusters
are suggested to have already formed in the as-deposited NiO-YSZ films. They were not detected
by the XRD (Fig. 3a) because of poor crystallinity, but were readily revealed by the XPS analyses
of valence states of Zr and Y. Fig. 4c presents the binding energies of the Ni 2P3/2 in the
as-deposited films. A strong peak at 856.1 eV and a satellite peak at 862.5 eV, whose intensities
increase with the DC power delivered to the Ni target, are obtained from the samples. These two
binding energies relate to the Ni2+ state in bulk NiO [58] and have also been obtained from thin NiO
coatings on the YSZ surface [59,60]. Another peak centered at 853.4 eV is attributed to the Ni0
state in Ni clusters [59]. Metallic Ni clusters could be formed by the decomposition of NiO during
the Ar+ cleaning step [58], and were not present in the original sample. The intensity of the Zr 3d
and Y 3d peaks declines, while the intensity of the Ni 2P peaks increases as the DC power that is
supplied to the Ni target increases from 20 to 60 W, as presented in Figs. 4a-4c. According to
analyses of the XPS spectra, the molar ratios of NiO/YSZ on the surface are 58/42, 74/26 and 85/15
in the NiO-YSZ films that were deposited using 20, 40 and 60 W of DC power to the Ni target,
respectively.
Fig. 5 presents the atomic ratios of Ni/(Ni+Zr) of the as-deposited NiO-YSZ(), air-annealed
NiO-YSZ() and vacuum-annealed Ni-YSZ() films, which are determined by EDS analyses.
The ratio of Ni is less in the Ni-YSZ films than in the NiO-YSZ films possibly because Ni is lost
by reacting with residual moisture to produce volatile Ni(OH)2 [61]. The ratios of Ni are
increased with the DC power to the Ni target. The final atomic ratios of Ni/(Ni+Zr) are 73%,
88% and 92% for the Ni-YSZ films that were originally prepared at 20, 40 and 60 W of DC power
delivered to the Ni target during deposition, respectively. The calculated volume ratios of
Ni/(Ni+YSZ) of these films () are 45%, 68% and 78%.
According to the XRD, XPS and EDS analyses, the as-deposited films comprised NiO
crystallites and poor crystalline YSZ clusters. Mixtures of NiO and 8YSZ grains were derived
after the as-deposited films were annealed in air at 900 °C for 1.5h. The NiO phase decomposed
to Ni while the YSZ remained after the air-annealed NiO-YSZ films were annealed in a vacuum at
800 °C for 2h. According to the surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the as-deposited and
post-annealed NiO-YSZ films, voids are generated by heat treatment. These voids may be
generated from the transformation of the YSZ phase in the NiO-YSZ film from poor crystalline
clusters to crystalline grains. Amorphous YSZ film with a low density of 3.9 to 4.7 g cm-3 was
27
fluctuated during the measurements, and its maximum power density was between 0.6 mW cm-2
and 1.14 mW cm-2, which is similar to or better than that with the thick Ni-YSZ anode used in this
work.
The I-V characteristics of the SOFCs with the thin film anode and the thick film anode also
fluctuated when the measurement temperature was raised above 700 °C. Various mechanisms for
the instability of Ni-YSZ cermets have been discussed. Waldbillig et al. [63] noted that a small
amount of air could re-oxidize Ni, and that the cyclic reduction and oxidation of Ni degraded SOFC.
Cassidy et al. [10] observed cracking along anode-electrolyte interface when Ni-YSZ was
re-oxidized with a change in volume. Zhang et al. [64] and Tulenin et al. [65] investigated
oscillatory reactions over a Ni surface during the partial oxidation of CH4 gas. The Ni catalyst
surface became cyclically oxidized by reaction with oxygen and was reduced by reaction with CH4.
Complex surface phenomena occurred when both oxidant and reducing agents were present.
Dicks [66] reviewed the reforming of natural gas and explained the breakdown of a supported Ni
catalyst by the growth of carbon filaments due to low steam partial pressure. The reasons for the
fluctuation of the output of the SOFC in this work may be complex. Carbon deposit and Ni
oxidation may be present on surface of the Ni-YSZ anode. On the other hand, during the
preparation of the specimen for SEM inspection, the triple-layered anode was peeled off from the
surface of the thin porous Ni-YSZ coating. Cracking in the triple-layered Ni-YSZ anode films
may have been caused by the sintering of the top Ni layer during the SOFC’s measurement. Figs.
9a and 9b present surface morphology of the triple-layered Ni-YSZ before and after the SOFC’s
measurement. The top surface of the Ni layer comprises grains of about 100 nm in diameter
before the SOFC measurement, as presented in Fig. 9a. After the SOFC measurement, sintering of
the top Ni layer is observed and the grains grow to a few hundred nm, as shown in Fig. 9b. The
sintering of the top Ni layer reduces the number of pores on the top surface. Therefore, the
triple-layered anode may be degraded by the unstable top Ni layer. Fig. 9c presents the surface
morphology of the thin film Ni-YSZ anode following the SOFC measurement. The surface of the
thin Ni-YSZ anode retains its nano-porous structure with linked crystallites of about 30 nm in size.
Therefore, the thin porous anode may perform stably even though its performance is not as good as
that of a conventionally screen-printed thick anode film.
The potential to use a thin Ni-YSZ anode in SOFCs has been demonstrated. The thin porous
Ni-YSZ anode itself exhibits small power efficiency. When incorporated with a thicker thin
porous anode, the power density can be increased to a value similar to that of a conventional thick
anode film. Therefore, the thin porous Ni-YSZ layer made by co-sputtering and post-annealing
techniques may be suitable as an intermediate anode layer to improve the efficiency of SOFCs. A
thicker thin porous Ni-YSZ anode may exhibit similar power efficiency as that of conventional
thick anode. Improvement of power efficiency and stability of SOFC using thin film anode is
currently under investigation.
4. Conclusion
Porous Ni-YSZ thin films were produced using reactive co-sputtering and vacuum annealing.
The pore and grain sizes of the porous Ni-YSZ films are tens of nanometers. A solid oxide fuel
cell using a 0.7μm thin porous Ni-YSZ film as an anode yields a power density of 0.38 mW cm-2 in
a mixture of methane and air at 700°C. The power density of the SOFC with the thin Ni-YSZ
anode was less than that with a 20μm thick screen-printed Ni-YSZ anode. The power density of
the SOFC using thin Ni-YSZ anode could be increased but fluctuated between 0.6 and 1.14 mW
cm-2, when a modified three-layered Ni-YSZ was used as the anode.
