Abstract. During the last decade, a large amount of research has been published in Taiwan on the 
reduction of the urban heat island effect for different strategies. The most important strategy for 
reducing ambient temperature and mitigating the heat island effect is to encourage citizens to build  
green roofs on their buildings. For analyzing the effect of a green roof on the thermal environment, 
this paper collects temperature and humidity data from two building roofs that have different 
greening levels and tries to analyze the thermal influence of a green roof on air temperature in Taipei 
City. The results of this research can give citizens an idea what kind of thermal environment they can 
benefit from; moreover, it also can provide useful data to governments for calculating the 
environmental benefit if they carry out a green roof policy. 
Introduction 
Taipei is the biggest metropolis of Taiwan, which has a population around 5,000,000 with a very 
concentrated living density. The high concentration of buildings in the city has resulted in many 
environmental issues, such as air pollution, traffic jams, urban warming, and the urban heat island 
effect. To potentially address these problems, several studies have indicated that green roofs can be 
used to mitigate some problems associated with storm water runoff, the urban heat island effect, 
wildlife habitats, along with air quality and energy consumption (Liu and Baskaran, 2003; Wong et 
al., 2003; Takebayashi and Moriyama, 2007). In recent years, motivated by ecological concerns, the 
government has promoted people to build sustainable architecture, to mitigate a building’s negative 
impact on the urban environment, and to create harmony between human and inhabitants who live in 
urban areas. Therefore, making more green roofs in the city could be the best ecological solution, 
which can improve air quality, mitigate the heat island effect, beautify the environment, and 
simultaneously make the city more sustainable. 
Although green roofs can cool the ambient air through consuming the solar heat that is gained 
from transpiration and photosynthesis, some quantitative data on its thermal benefits are desirable for 
exploring the thermal impacts of green roofs in the Taipei metropolitan area. The objective of this 
study is to find answers for the reduction of air temperature by examining two types of green roofs at 
four different levels of height. 
Method 
1. Study area 
Two study areas are located in Taipei City. Site A is the roof of an international company with an 
abundance of vegetation on it; and Site B is the roof of an elementary school building with a large 
area of grass on top. Both sites have a green roof covering, but with different vegetation (Fig. 1 and 
Fig. 2). 
 
  
 
3. Data analysis 
In this research, the green coverage ratio of Site A and Site B are 24.42% and 35.05% by 
calculating the greening area within a radius of 10 meters. This study not only made comparative 
analyses of the data of four different level of height at two different study sites for figuring out the 
thermal benefit of green roofs; but it also tried to analyze the relationship between the green coverage 
ratio and air temperature at both sites. 
 
Results 
1. The temperature difference between Greening areas and Non-Greening areas 
The objective of this study was to find answers for the reduction of air temperatures at four 
different levels of height on two types of green roofs. To do this, we calculated the difference of 
temperature between the greening area and the non-greening area at both sites. The results showed 
that the thermal benefit of the greening of Site A and Site B were 0.438 and 0.202 in winter (Table 1), 
0.527 and 0.436 in spring (Table 2), and 0.669 and 1.708 in summer (Table 3). The results also 
verified that the greening roofs could decrease the ambient air temperature around 0.320 in winter, 
0.482 in spring, and 1.189 in summer. The thermal influence of green roofs on air temperature will be 
more significant when the weather becomes hot.

2. The temperature difference at four different levels of height 
By analyzing the data of the two study sites, this research demonstrated that the vegetation of a 
green roof could influence ambient air temperature at a height of 0.5 and 2.5 meters above the rooftop 
(Table 4 and Table 5). The results also indicated that the green roof decreased air temperature more 
significantly both at Site A and Site B at the height of 0.5 and 2.5 meters during the summer due to 
abundant transpiration.

Conclusions 
In this study, the thermal impact of green roofs in Taipei City was investigated through field 
measurement. From this quantitative research, it has been shown that there is an important potential 
for lowering urban temperatures when a building’s roof is covered with vegetation. The average 
thermal benefits of the two green roof study sites are 0.320 during the winter, 0.482 during the spring 
and 1.189 during the summer respectively. It can be concluded that planting vegetation on the rooftop 
could not only beautify the environment but also decrease the temperature in urban areas.  
Regarding the results of this study, we indicated that green roofs have a significant influence on 
cooling ambient air at the height of 0.5 and 2.5 meters and the quality and quantity of a greening roof 
played a significant role in lowering temperature in relation with the green coverage ratio. Therefore, 
if governments intend to use green roofs to mitigate the urban heat island effect, making a policy to 
stipulate the use of rooftop vegetation for every single building roof would be a very wise and 
efficient policy.
