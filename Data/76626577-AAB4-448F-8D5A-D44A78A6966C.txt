waveguide is highly efficient due to high laser intensity confined in the 
waveguide. However prior art always adopts a waveguide guiding all 
the mixing waves. This conventional approach is not practical for THz 
generation, because the THz wavelength is much longer than the other 
mixing wavelengths. The present invention adopts a waveguide for the 
THz wave, which is large enough to be considered a bulk for other 
mixing waves at the optical frequencies. Thus, high efficiency in the 
mixing process is achieved without sacrificing the energy throughput

In the past few years, the generations of terahertz (THz) wave radiation have 
drawn much attention. The scope of THz studies and applications includes molecular 
science, solid-state physics, biomedical applications, diagnostics, ultra-high speed 
optical communications and so forth.  
Conventional THz generation is from an ultra-fast laser gated semiconductor. 
With the high-voltage switch from the ultra-fast laser, short electromagnetic pulse 
would radiate out. Moreover, the Fourier content of the short electromagnetic pulse 
contains some energy in the THz spectrum. This technique has been an efficient way 
of producing incoherent, broadband THz radiations. 
In addition, there are many approaches to generate coherent THz waves. For 
example, free electron lasers have been used to generate widely tunable THz radiation, 
with frequencies varying over the region of 1 to 3 THz. However, the huge cost and 
large size of a free electron laser has restricted its use to a limited number of 
researchers1. With an effort to reduce the cost, the principal investigator of this project 
accomplished a $300 k-USD THz free electron laser radiating at 85-µm wavelength 
during 1990 ~ 1994 at Stanford University.  
Another method to generate THz-wave is using so-called p-type germanium 
lasers. Nevertheless, a large current, a strong magnetic field, and ultra-low 
temperature are required2,3. Due to the difficulties of generation and detection, the 
development of terahertz wave has lagged. Thus, there is significant potential in 
developing a simple, convenient, and tunable terahertz wave source. In contrast to 
those methods mentioned above, many research efforts had been carried out in the 
past decades by using optical technology to generate tunable coherent far-infrared 
electromagnetic waves. 
Following Pantell’s work4 , Hiromasa Ito’s group has generated THz-wave 
through optical parametric generation (TPG) and oscillation (TPO) in lithium niobate 
(LiNbO3). They achieved continuous tuning over a wide wavelength range (120~310 
µm, 0.97~2.5 THz). Although Ito has greatly improved Pantell’s original work, the 
output power and conversion efficiency of his TPG and TPO are not very impressive. 
In his experiment, the non-collinear configuration seriously limited the interaction 
length and thus the conversion efficiency in the nonlinear conversion process.  
Secondly the strong THz absorption in lithium niobate or lithium tantalite greatly 
reduced the THz output. In addition, the refractive index of the crystal materials at 
THz was so high and most THz power was trapped in the nonlinear crystals.   For 
example, K. Kawase et al tried to couple out the THz-wave radiation from a LiNbO3 
 5
PPLN. During the past years, there have been several successful experimental 
demonstrations of THz-wave parametric oscillation (TPO) in lithium niobate crystals, 
despite the strong absorption in the THz region. For a PPLN backward TPO, the 
required QPM grating period is in the range of 30-40 µm, which is in the most 
comfortable range of the PPLN electric-field-poling techniques. Therefore, achieving 
PPLN backward parametric oscillation in the THz region becomes a feasible and 
attractive research direction. Nevertheless, the THz-wave propagates in PPLN crystals 
forming a TM waveguide mode. The waveguide confinement for the THz radiation 
could greatly reduce the threshold intensity of the backward TPO. In the backward 
collinearly phase-matched configuration, one further takes the advantage of long gain 
length and mode confinement in backward phase-matched PPLN THz waveguides 
and demonstrates the preliminary evidence of backward TPO by pumping the PPLN 
waveguides with an actively Q-switched (AQS) Nd:YAG laser. 
 In this project, we set several targets, which have to be complete in series, 
1) Non-co-linear TPG, bulk/waveguide 
2) Non-co-linear TPO, bulk/waveguide 
3) Co-linear TPG, forward 
4) Co-linear TPO, backward 
5) The formation and integration of DFB structures 
 
Targets 1) and 2) base on the conventional TPG/TPO techniques and aim to develop 
the basic THz techniques in our research group. We will emphasis on the waveguide 
version so that the conversion efficiency and the mode characteristics can be 
enhanced and clarified, respectively. Targets 3) and 4) base on our previous expertise, 
quasi-phase-matching (QPM) techniques, and have an important goal to achieve 
co-linear phase-matching conditions, so that the gain length of the generation of the 
THz radiation is greatly increased. If a proper dichroic mechanism is introduced, 
high-power THz radiation can be separated from its original pump. We expect 
µJ-level THz pulses should be generated from the QPM co-linear TPG devices. As to 
targer 5), it depends on the success of targets 1) to 4). However, the strong absorption 
of the THz radiation in the substrate material might severely affect the function of the 
DFB structure. This issue is to be addressed in the future.

1. Historical Background 
The scientist of India C. V. Raman9 observed that the sea of the Mediterranean is 
 7
A certain class of materials, referred to as infrared active, allow a combination of 
parametric- and Raman-mixing scattering processes. These materials have the 
property of both absorbing and generating electromagnetic radiation from dipole 
movements at the crystal vibration frequency. Therefore, the optical modes and 
radiated electromagnetic fields greatly influence the dispersion curve of 
infrared-active materials. 
 
Figure 1 Dispersion curve of an infrared-active material, elementary excitation generated by 
combination of a photon and a transverse optical phonon (WTO). The polariton in the low-energy region 
behave like a photon at THz frequency. K is the propagation constant. 
 
Besides purely parametric and purely Raman scattering process, materials which 
are called infrared active allow parametric- and Raman-mixing scattering process. 
Infrared active materials have the properties both absorb and generate electromagnetic 
radiation due to the dipole moments at the crystal vibration frequency. Therefore, the 
optical modes and electromagnetic radiations have a lot of influences on the 
dispersion curve of an infrared-active material.11 Then, the dispersion curve could be 
classified into photon-like, partly phonon-like, and photon-phonon-like regions, as 
shown in Figure 112,13. When we varied the terahertz prorogation constant into the 
photon-phonon-like region, the nonlinearity of an infrared-active material comes from 
both electrons motion and ionic vibration. Thus, both signal and terahertz outputs are 
obtained.

z-direction, or parallel to the crystal optical axis. Therefore, the coupled-wave 
equation becomes a scalar equation. For simplicity, we first consider the case with a 
single vibration mode. Then the discussion will be extended to multimode case later. 
The polarization vector comes from the mechanical vibration, which is related to 
the electric field through the equation for the driven harmonic oscillator, thus

where e is the charge associated with the transverse vibration, N is the number of 
particles per unit cell per unit volume, and X is separation of vibrating particles in

the motion of equation can be expressed as:

1. Non-co-linear phase-matching schemes 
Two conditions must be satisfied in a frequency conversion process: energy 
conversion and momentum conversion. In this experiment, there are three waves, 
pump, signal, and terahertz, in the process. These two conditions for this interaction 
can be written as equations (10) and (11).

The subscripts p, s, and i denote the pump, signal, and idler, respectively. With the 
QPM technique, the collinear phase-matching condition can be achieved with the use 
of the highest nonlinear coefficient in a nonlinear optical crystal. Furthermore, one

where Ip is the pump intensity and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. From the above, a 
direct method to enhance the efficiency of OPG is to increase the pump intensity. In 
addition, increasing the crystal length is another method to increase the efficiency of 
OPG. While in the case of QPM OPG, it requires additional work to resolve the 
problem but in principle there are few differences between QPM OPG and a 
conventional one. QPM needs periodical modulation of the nonlinear coefficient of a 
nonlinear optical crystal. One could simply express the periodically modulated 
nonlinear coefficient as the summation of its Fourier series components in the spatial 
domain given by:

where Λ= mkm π2  is the wave number of the domain grating of the m-th order 
harmonics, and ? is the period of the modulated domain. Therefore, one can 
compensate the phase-mismatching by adding the additional term of Λπ2  to 
achieve momentum conservation. The flexibility of phase matching arbitrary 
wavelengths by choosing a proper QPM grating period was unavailable in the 
birefringent phase-matched technique, whereas it becomes possible in the QPM 
technique. PPLN is the most common QPM material offering numerous advantages in 
various nonlinear-frequency-conversion processes with its wide transparent range

Figure 9. Calculated exponential gain coefficient for the parametric THz-wave generation in PPLN 
from 1064-nm pumped. 
 
Figure 9 shows the calculated parametric gain at typical pump intensities for 
 19
parametric oscillators. The threshold intensity monotonically decreases with the 
increase of the pump wavelength due to the dependence of ( ) 21sT wwg ∝  with 
ps ww ≈  for TPO. With a short interaction length, there exists a minimum threshold 
intensity at a certain wavelength due to the trade-off between the reduced absorption 
loss and its wavelength dependence. For a longer interaction length, the threshold 
intensity does not have a local minimum between the 150-µm and 350-µm 
wavelength range. Figure 10 shows the possibility of reaching the threshold intensity 
of a backward parametric oscillator from a collinearly phase matched PPLN crystal. 
The damage threshold for lithium niobate can be as high as 2 ? 1010 W/cm2 for a 
30-ns laser pulse. Therefore, we can achieve the backward OPO threshold intensity 
and generate backward THz waves from a collinearly phase-matched PPLN.

5. Waveguide Enhancement 
Waveguide confinement of mixing waves is known to enhance the efficiency in a 
nonlinear frequency mixing process. In a slab waveguide of thickness t and refractive 
index THzn  at the THz wavelength THzλ , the maximum number of THz modes 
supported by the waveguide is given by28  THzTHzntm λ12 2max −= . For example, 
the maximum numbers of the waveguide modes in 0.5-, 0.78-, and 1-mm-thick 
 21
grating mirror arrangement as shown in Fig. 12. 
 
Figure 12 Grating and tuning mirror arrangement illustrating angles were used in the analysis. 
 
We call the case of one trip in optical path as the single-pass and we discussed 
the single-pass bandwidth first and then we will extend to the multiple-pass condition. 
When the light is incident toward the grating, it will be diffracted by the grating and 
reflected by the HR mirror to the grating again. Furthermore, it will be diffracted 
again. According to the basic grating formula, we can obtain

such that m equal to m’. Under above assumption we can rewrite the equation as

where λsignal is defined under the above situation. 
The spectral bandwidth of the laser ∆λ is determined by the grating acceptance 
angle and the ratio of the effective spectrometer length to the width of the active 
region (exit slit width). Thus the bandwidth of this system is given by [ ]

PART I. Enhanced Terahertz-wave Parametric Generation and Oscillation 
in Lithium-Niobate Waveguides at Terahertz 
 
1. Experimental Scheme 
Figure 13 shows the schematic of our TPG and TPO experiments. The pump 
source is an actively Q-switched Nd:YAG laser, producing laser pulses at 1064 nm 
with a 5.8-ns pulse width. The pump laser was first attenuated by a polarizer 
following a half-wave plate and focused into a LiNbO3 nonlinear waveguide. The two 
off-axis flat reflectors having 99.5% reflectance at 1071 nm form a singly resonant 
THz-wave parametric oscillator. Without the two reflectors, the 1064-nm pumped 
LiNbO3 waveguide is a THz parametric generator. The nonlinear waveguides used in 
the experiments were three 45-mm long, 15-mm wide double-side polished z-cut 
congruent LiNbO3 slabs with thicknesses of 0.5, 0.78, and 1 mm. All three LiNbO3 
slabs were used in our TPG experiment for studying thickness dependence of 
waveguide-enhanced parametric gain. The 1-mm crystal slab was used for 
demonstrating high-efficiency, low-threshold TPO. Each crystal slab has a 65°-angle 
cut with respect to the pump beam for coupling out THz waves, as shown in Fig. 13. 
The input and output faces of the LiNbO3 wafers were coated with anti-reflection

of the LiNbO3 waveguide was reduced from 1 to 0.5 mm. The 1.61% single-pass 
parametric efficiency and the generated signal energy from the 0.5-mm-thick 
waveguide have been greatly improved from previously reported values30 for a 
1064-nm pumped LiNbO3 THz-wave parametric generator at 2.2-mJ pump energy. 
When the waveguide thickness was reduced from 1 to 0.5 mm, the signal pulse width 
was also reduced from 4 to 2.8 ns. The reduction in the signal pulse width is a 
signature of high-gain parametric generation in the thinner waveguide due to a highly 
nonlinear growth rate of the signal wave in an exponential-gain process. The higher 
parametric gain and THz-mode excitation also caused signal spectral broadening to 
the signal in thinner LiNbO3 waveguides. 
 
 
Figure 14 Direct observation of the near-infrared signal wave with an IR card. The distance from the 
crystal end side to the IR card is 40 cm and the separation between the pump and signal wave is 18 mm. 
The phase matching angle is approximately 1.17 degrees inside the crystal. 
 
3. The Evidence of the Waveguide Mode 
In order to investigate the THz-mode frequencies in the TPG process, we 
translated the 1-mm-thick LiNbO3 waveguide in the z direction so that the pump laser 
was displaced vertically from the waveguide-gap center. At different vertical positions, 
the pump laser can selectively excite one or several high-order THz-wave modes with 
which the pump laser mode has a good overlap. The slightly different frequencies of 
the generated THz modes are encoded into the signal output spectrum according to 
the frequency-conservation law. Figure 15 shows that the measured center wavelength 
of the signal output spectrum indeed varies with the pump displacement from the 
waveguide-gap center z∆ , where a positive z∆  denotes a pump beam above the 
waveguide-gap center. As expected, the signal-wavelength shift is symmetric about

oscillation threshold is apparently below 2 mJ in pump energy or 70 MW/cm2 in 
pump intensity, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the lowest pump threshold 
ever reported for a LiNbO3 THz-wave parametric oscillator27. An intracavity signal 
energy of 0.31 mJ was generated at a pump energy of 4.3 mJ or at a pump level 2.15 
times above the threshold.

using a 1-mm-thick, 45-mm-long LiNbO3 slab waveguide. The pump threshold at 1064 nm is as low as 
70 MW/cm2. 
 
To measure the THz output wavelength, we used a room-temperature, deuterated 
triglycine sulfate (DTGS) pyrodetector immediately after an air-gap GaAs scanning 
etalon near the exit cut of the LiNbO3 waveguide. Each of the two GaAs plates has a 
thickness of 0.633 mm. Figure 17 shows the fitting between the measured THz 
transmission and the Airy function. The characteristic period of the etalon 
transmission curve clearly indicates a THz wavelength of 162 µm. In the 
measurement, we averaged 1000 pulses for each data point and the signal-to-noise 
ratio at the peak transmission was about 7~10. Because we did not calibrate the 
DTGS detector, we were not able to deduce the exact output energy of the THz wave. 
In this work, the energy extraction technique for the THz wave was not optimized. It 
is our next effort to maximize the energy extraction of the THz wave and calibrate the 
measured energy.

Minilase II/20, and the configuration of this part is shown on the upper left of Fig. 18. 
When the pumping laser beam passed through the lithium niobate which was a 
45-mm long, 15-mm wide, and 1-mm thick z-cut congruent LiNbO3 slab with 
double-side polished in x-y surface, the signal wave and THz wave was then 
generated from this lithium niobate chip. 
 
Figure 18 The configuration of the GITPO. 
 
In general, the signal wave also needs to be narrowed down its line width, 
therefore the band width of THz wave can not be over the total band width of pump 
laser and signal wave. To achieve this goal, we utilized two mirrors and a 1200 
grooves/mm grating to oscillate the signal wave. The THz wave can be coupled out by 
a silicon grating coupler which can overcome the total internal reflection problem 
inside the lithium noibate due to the refractive index = 5.5 of the THz wave. After that, 
the 90 deg off-axis mirrors (50.8mm diameter and effective focus length is 152.4mm) 
was conducted to collect THz wave, and focused the THz-wave into a 4k silicon 
bolometer. A 4k silicon-bolometer was used to measure the THz-wave radiation, and 
the corresponding near-infrared signal wave spectrum was confirmed by a 1/2-m CVI 
monochrometer. In the measurement of terahertz wave line width, the wire-mesh 
etalon which is high reflective mirror for terahertz wave was constructed. The signal 
power vs. pumping laser power was also measured by utilizing pyrodetector. In

intracavity grating was gold-coated with 1200 grooves/mm. 
In this setup, we utilized the M2 to feedback the -1st order therefore the 1064-nm 
wavelength laser is coupled out through the 0th order grating output. We used a 1/2-m 
grating monochoromater (CVI DK480) to measure the central wavelength and use an 
air-spaced etalon to measure the laser line width. After lasing, the line width of this 
laser reduced from 30GHz to 350 MHz. In order to scan the line width of this seeding 
laser, two high reflective mirrors and the piezoelectric translation stage (THORLABS 
MDT690) were formed as the Fabry-Perot (FP) etalon to scan the real laser line width 
of this laser. When we input the 0.3 volt pulse to the piezoelectric translation stage 
and the distance between two mirrors is 3 cm, the FP etalon can scan the 4.195 GHz 
band width repeatedly. As Fig. 20 indicates the actual line width was 350 MHz. In 
addition, by adjusting the angle of mirror 2, the 1064-nm emission was tuned over 
0.42-nm range as the Fig. 21 shows the tuning region. In addition, the incident angle 
of 1064-nm wavelength was approximately 85° for emitting wavelength. This is the 
most oblique angle we can achieve for 1064-nm laser lasing because when the 
incident angle is larger, the diffraction efficiency is smaller and 1064-nm laser 
oscillation becomes impossible.

resolution for reducing the laser line width therefore we chose the most oblique angle 
and the 1064-nm wavelength still can be oscillated under the 25-ampere 808nm diode 
laser pumping. 
Figure 22 indicates that if the central wavelength of seeding laser is not at the 
full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) gain band width of Mililase II, the original and 
seeding wavelength will compete for the gain of the Nd:YAG., the dotted line shows 
this phenomena. On the other hand the broken line and thin line are the desired 
situations for our applications. After 350 MHz laser seeding, the line width of 
Minilase II was reduced from 0.12nm (30GHz) to 0.035nm (9GHz). The 0.035nm is 
quit close the resolution of our monochrometer and we expected that the line width of 
Minilase II was also close to 350 MHz. Although the monochrometer can not resolve 
the real line width of Minilase II, it still can provide the center wavelength location so 
that we can confirm that the seeding result is good or not.  
When we did the GITPO experiment, we utilized the optical spectrum analyzer 
(OSA) to confirm the central wavelength of the seeding laser hence we can tune the 
incident center wavelength. On the other hand, we can avoid the two wavelength gain 
competition problem which is mentioned above. 
However nothing is perfect when we succeeded in reducing the pumping laser 
line width by seeding the narrow line width laser, the energy jitter problem sometimes 
appeared. In general, the energy fluctuation of the high power Q-switch laser is very 
larger, especially when we seeded another laser into it. It will amplify the energy 
fluctuation of the seeding laser. In this seeding experiment, the original energy 
fluctuation of the Minilase II is close 10% to 20%. And after seeding, it will be 
increased to 30%. About the fluctuation percentage is according to EfMax= (Emean-EMax 
or min)/Emean ·100%. From this equation we can obtain the worst-case energy 
fluctuation. 
 
3. The Grating Coupler 
Owing to the large refractive index of lithium niobate31 at THz frequencies, 
shown in Fig. 23, most of the generated THz power was trapped in the nonlinear 
crystals. In order to couple out the generated THz-wave, we utilized a silicon grating 
coupler attached to the side-surface of the LiNbO3 crystals to extract out the THz 
wave. In the non-collinear TPG, the angle between the signal and the THz waves is 
about 65 degree. Therefore the THz wave makes an incident angle about 25 degree 
when it impinges to the side-surface of the LiNbO3 wafers, shown in Fig. 24. The 
relation between the grating period Λ and the m-th-order radiation angle θm to the 
grating surface is give by 
 35
THz-wave which is about 20 degrees. The right-hand-side picture of Fig. 25 also 
shows that there is only one diffraction order upon which all the diffracted THz power 
will concentrate. The groove depth and the groove width of the silicon grating coupler 
are 50 µm and 65µm, respectively. The thickness of the silicon grating is 240µm. 
Furthermore, the silicon grating coupler was contacted to the y-z surface which was 
optically polished and it was pressed by a specially designed holder against the y-z 
surface of the LiNbO3 crystal to maximize THz wave coupling out efficiency. 
 
 
Figure 25 the left figure is the grating coupler which grating period and depth is 125 and 50 µm 
respectively then the right is the calculation by using above equation. 
 
4. The Power and Linewidth Measurement of a Linear-cavity TPO 
In order to show the effect of the intra-cavity grating at the grazing incidence 
angle, we tried to assemble a linear-cavity TPO with its cavity length and output 
coupler similar to the GITPO. The linear-cavity TPO included the 1000-µm-thick 
LiNbO3 crystal, a 99.9% high reflector, and 50% output coupler for signal wave. The 
50% output coupler was chosen for comparison with grazing incident grating which 
was a narrow line-width and output-coupler element in the GITPO configuration 
which will be discussed more detail in the next section. The 50% output coupler is 
quite closed to the double-pass diffraction efficiency of the intra-cavity grating in the 
GITPO configuration. The cavity length was chosen the 135mm which was exactly 
the cavity length of the GITPO. 
For the threshold measurement, we observed that the threshold was apparently 
below 2.2 mJ or 70 MW/cm2, which is the best of our knowledge, the lowest 
oscillation threshold ever reported for LiNbO3 TPO, as shown in the Fig. 26. The 
signal of 0.49 mJ was generated at pump energy of 4.6 mJ. Therefore the conversion 
efficiency of the signal wave was 10.6%, the ~166 µm THz wave was generated the

In this experiment, we measured the line width of the signal wave by utilizing 
the Fast Gate Intergrators and Boxcar Averagers (Stanford Research system model 
SR280-system Mainframe) to do 30-pulse integral because Mililase II pumping laser 
has low repetition rate laser which is 10 Hz. The Figure 27 shows the spectrum of the 
TPO which line width was reduced from 235GHz to the 120GHz. 
 
5. The Performance of the GITPO 
In the previous section, we observed the terahertz parametric oscillator can 
provide the high conversion efficiency, narrow line width of the signal wave which 
was compared with the terahertz parametric generation. In general, the bandwidth of 
THz wave was the sum of the pumping and signal bandwidths. This means that if we 
can reduce the signal bandwidth, we can obtain a narrower THz bandwidth. Therefore 
we again utilized the Littman configuration to oscillate signal wave to reduce band 
width of the signal wave. This configuration not only reduced the signal bandwidth 
but also oscillated the signal wave to obtain high conversion efficiency. 
The alignment method needs to be described due to the wavelength is not exactly 
twice than the alignment green laser therefore it is a little tricky to align the GITPO. 
The alignment procedure is described as the followings. First, we aligned the 
Fabry-Perot (FP) linear cavity and measure the output power to insure the oscillator 
did establish or not. After the FP linear cavity laser was lasing, we replaced the output 
coupler by the grating. When the signal wave was incident to the grating, it diffracted 
2 beams which were 0th-order and 1th-order respectively. Next, we traced the 0th 
diffraction beam of the signal wave by using alignment green laser thus we utilized its 
-1th-order to adjust the HR mirror which was above the grating. If the central 
wavelength of signal wave was 1064nm, it can be easy to use this kind alignment 
procedure, however right now the signal wave is about 1071nm. This means that the 
green laser will be not overlapped with the signal wave when the -1th-order of signal 
reflected back to the LiNbO3. Nevertheless this alignment still can provide x-axis 
alignment and we can rotate the HR mirror along the y-axis to check another 
dimension then we can observe the signal output power energy will increase more 
than twice when the oscillation did establish. 
For the GITPO experiment, we can measure the 0th order power and determine 
the pulse width to see if the oscillation was indeed established. For the 1-mm-thick 
CLN crystal, we first insert the metal sheet between the high reflector and the grating 
to destroy the oscillation, and then we measured the pulse width by using the 1-GHz 
bandwidth measuring system including a silicon detector and a digital oscilloscope. 
The result shows a 2.6-ns signal pulse width. After that, we removed the metal sheet, 
and found that the signal pulse width increased to 3.8 ns, shown in Fig. 28. 
 39
In addition, we could measure the 0th-order power of the diffraction grating to 
check the establishment of the oscillation. Figure 29 shows the energy performance of 
the GITPO. We observed that the oscillation effect reduced the pumping threshold 
from 3.4mJ to 2.2mJ. The conversion efficiency was also increased by a factor of 7 
when the pumping energy was 4.4 mJ. Obviously we can discover that the energy of 
the GITPO was lower than the linear TPO. Although we utilized the quit same 
condition in linear TPO for example, the output coupling and the cavity length. The 
loss was coming from that the beam of the minus one order was expanded larger than 
the reflector mirror. So even we consider the 0th and 1st diffraction loss in the grating, 
there are still other loss in the geometry setup. However we still obtained the 4.7% 
conversion efficiency of the signal wave and the impressive bandwidth which will be 
discussed later. 
 
Figure 30 The temporal wave forms of the pump (1064nm) and signal (1071nm). When the pump 
energy was 4.6 mJ, pump depletion was observed in the GITPO experiment. 
 
Figure 30 shows the temporal wave forms of the pump and signal under the 
4.6mJ pumping the LiNbO3. We observed pump depletion effect under the maximum 
pumping energy incident on the LiNbO3. However the bandwidth of our oscilloscope 
is 1 GHz, thus the depletion phenomenon can not be observed very clearly.  
The pulse width of the pumping laser and signal wave are about 7 and 3.8 ns, 
respectively. Therefore we can estimate how many round trips in the GITPO process 
further according to the Littman equation, Eq. (33), the theoretical line width can be 
obtained. Figure 31 shows the theoretical single pass bandwidth, further the multiple 
pass bandwidths was obtained by

Figure 32 This plot shows the signal spectra of TPG and GITPO. The bandwidth of the signal wave 
was reduced from 235 GHz to 13 GHz. 
 
To measure the THz wavelength, we used a 4K-Si bolometer (Infrared 
Laboratories) after two Ni-metal mesh with 65-µm grid between the pair of the 
off-axis mirrors, as shown in Fig. 18. The THz wavelength was measured by utilizing 
the scanning Fabry-Perot etalon spacing varied up to 540µm using the automatic 
scanning system. As for the structure of Fabry-Perot etalon, we mounted the wire 
mesh on the metal ring which was fixed to a 2” mirror mount for tilting of the mesh. 
The scanning system included the translation stage (Mitutoyo) and the 5-phase step 
motor (model PK564AU-TG20 with0.036° per one step); furthermore we utilized a 
connector to link the translation stage and the step motor for controlling the spacing of 
the interferometer. And the stepping motor and the signal receiving from lock-in 
amplifier were controlled by the Lab View program. 
As we know the THz wave is invisible light, therefore to align it directly is not 
easy. Recall Part B Grating Coupler, we know the exit angle of the THz-wave which 
is about 20 degree, and thus we utilized a green laser to simulate pass route of THz 
wave. At the same time, we used an alignment green laser to insure the parallelism of 
the Ni mesh Fabry-Perot etalon. In addition, in order to avoid the water-vapor 
absorption problem, a nitrogen purge system was installed. 
The process of THz-wavelength measurement is described as following. First we 
utilized the pair of off-axis mirrors (f=15cm) to collect the THz Wave, and we used 
the divergent light source to observe the focus point of the off-axis mirror. Second we

Figure 35 shows the wavelength measurement of THz wave and its fitting curve 
under the signal is optimized for maximum output. When the signal was kept at the 
maximum output, the central wavelength is 1071.5 nm. The corresponding THz 
wavelength is about 163µm. In the experiment, the characteristic period of the etalon 
transmission curve clearly indicated that THz wavelength was 166 µm. The 
inaccuracy comes from measurement system because the rotation axis of the step 
motor and the translation stage is not matched perfectly by utilizing the special 
connecter. 
 
Figure 35 THz-wave intensity transmitted through a scanning metal mesh etalon as a function of the 
etalon gap in the GITPO experiment. A 166-µm THz wavelength can be determined from the 
periodicity of the fitting curve which shows the wavelength of THz-wave is 166?m and the 
corresponding signal is 1071.5nm. 
 
The free spectral range (FSR) of the Fabry-Perot etalon was about 500GHz, and 
the line width was measured to be almost 120GHz. However under no other 
absorption condition, we assume the reflectivity of the metal mesh was about 80% 
which was deduce by the 20 % transmittance of FTIR measurement for 166-　m 
wavelength, therefore the theoretically finesse was 23.3907, as shown in the red line 
in Figure 3-19. Therefore we can observe that the theoretical curve was very close to 
the fitting curve. In the theoretical calculation, we did not consider the loss of the 
metal mesh and the effective finesse; in the other words, the experimental finesse was 
less than the theoretical one. Therefore the resolution of this Fabry-Perot etalon was 
not high enough to resolve the real bandwidth of the THz wave under the 300µm gap

is 10.6% and 4.7% respectively by utilizing a 1-mm-thick, 45-mm-long z-cut LiNbO3 
THz slab waveguide. In addition, we also demonstrated a waveguide parametric 
oscillator with an ultra-low threshold intensity of 70 MW/cm2. In addition, we can 
tune the ?z to fine tune the signal’s center wavelength, when we tune the 240µ m we 
can get the 0.1nm shift and we can obtain the 0.5-nm tuning range by adjusting the 
HR mirror of the GIPTO setup. Therefore we could fine tune the THz by waveguide 
effect and the rough tune THz by rotating the reflective mirror angle of the GITPO 
configuration. Furthermore we measure the bandwidth of signal can be narrowed 
down from 235 to 13GHz. In addition, the wavelength of the THz wave was about 
166µm under the signal wave is 1071.5nm.

The PPLN period, ΛPPLN, can be determined from the dispersion characteristics of 
lithium niobate for a given set of mixing wavelengths. However, the dispersion 
characteristics of lithium niobate in the THz spectral range are not yet completely 
known. We interpolated the extraordinary refractive indices, and calculated the 
extraordinary refractive index from the reported absorption modes 33 . Accurate 
extraordinary refractive indices are not known in lithium niobate, especially in the 
wavelength range from 100 to 500 µm. Based on the calculated refractive index, we 
establish a theoretical analysis for collinear TPG. Without loss of generality, based 
 47
~50 µm, and it is relatively hard to couple the pump into the crystal. On the contrary, 
utilizing a thicker lithium niobate crystal can suppress the waveguide effect and result 
in a parametric process close to that in a bulk crystal.

2. High-efficiency Forward Collinearly-Phase-Matched TPG in PPLN 
Waveguides 
To generate ~100-µm wavelengths from 532-nm pumped TPG, we designed a 
PPLN domain period of 71.5-µm from Ref. [34]. We fabricated a 6-cm-long, 
780-µm-thick, and 1-cm-wide PPLN crystal with both uncoated and optically 
polished end faces. The crystal was kept at the room temperature during the TPG 
experiment. Figure 38 shows the experimental setup of the collinearly phase-matched 
TPG experiment in a PPLN crystal. The pump source was a 532-nm actively 
Q-switched frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser with a 5-ns full-width-half-maximum 
(FWHM) pulse width. The laser polarization was aligned along the crystallographic z 
axis so as to access the largest nonlinear coefficient d33 in lithium niobate. We 
operated the pump laser at a 5-Hz repetition rate. The 5-ns pump pulse is much longer 
than the group walk-off distance between the THz wave and the optical waves in the 
6-cm PPLN crystal. To prevent laser damage, we kept the pump intensity less than 
200 MW/cm2 or kept the pump energy less than 150 µJ for laser waist radius of 100 
µm in the PPLN crystal. To separate the THz radiation from the pump and the signal 
waves, we installed a 45o optically polished copper reflector with a 1.2-mm-diameter

The measured THz wavelength was about 80 µm. 
 
It can be seen from Fig. 39 that the characteristic THz wavelength is 79.88 µm 
can be calculated from the fitted Airy function by λT equal to 2 times the period of the 
sinusoidal term. One can calculate the bandwidth of THz-wave from the theory of 
Fabry-Peort etalon, and the interferogram implies a broadband THz radiation from the 
TPG process. Figure 40(a) is the signal spectrum measured by a 1/2-m grating 
monochromater with a resolution of 0.06 nm. The wide signal’s bandwidth also 
indicates the existence of waveguide modes. In view of the frequency conservation 
law in a parametric process, the signal wavelength peaking near 535.6 nm is 
consistent with the THz characteristic wavelength shown in Fig. 39. The ~1-nm signal 
spectral width in Fig. 40(a) is also consistent with a coherence length of a few tens of 
microns in the THz interferogram. 
To further demonstrate low-pump-power and high-repetition-rate operation for 
collinearly phase-matched TPG, we employed a passively Q-switched (PQS) Nd:YAG 
laser for pumping a PPLN crystal at the room temperature. The PPLN crystal has a 
domain period of 67 µm, a length of 6 cm, and a thickness of 780 µm. The PQS laser 
produced 65-µJ/pulse energy at 1-kHz repetition rate and 1064-nm wavelength. The 
pulse length of the PQS laser was only ~500 ps or ~7 cm in the PPLN crystal, which 
was about the walk-off distance between the THz and the pump pulse in PPLN. 
Because of the shorter pulse length and longer pump wavelength, we were able to use 
a pump intensity of 700 MW/cm2 without damaging the PPLN crystal. Figure 40(b) 
shows that the signal spectrum of the 1064-nm pumped TPG was centered at 1067.4 
nm, implying a characteristic THz wavelength of 334 µm at the output. This time we

period of 80 µm. By replacing the 67-µm-period PPLN crystal with the 80-µm-period 
one in the PQS-laser pumped TPG experiment, we observed the signal wavelength 
shifted from 1067.4 nm to 1067.3 nm, corresponding to the THz wavelength shifted 
from 334 µm to 344 µm. This result indicates that lithium niobate is not very 
dispersive in this part of the THz spectrum. We also observed a factor two increase on 
the signal intensity due to the reduced walk-off problem in a shorter crystal. 
Compared to the signal spectra previously reported for TPG experiments36, the 
signal spectra in Fig. 40 clearly show spiky features for both the 532-nm and 1064-nm 
pumped PPLN TPG. The spectral peaks primarily appear on the long-wavelength side 
of the signal spectra, indicating that high-order waveguide modes with short THz 
wavelengths were excited in the 780-µm thick PPLN crystal. For comparison 
purposes, we also conducted a series of non-collinearly phase-matched 1064-nm 
pumped TPGs from z-cut lithium niobate wafers with 500, 780 and 1000-µm 
thicknesses, and always observed similar signatures of the THz waveguide modes on 
the long-wavelength sides of the signal spectra. Due to the waveguide mode 
confinement, those non-collinearly phase-matched TPG also showed significant 
enhancement on parametric efficiency compared to the previously reported 
experiments37,38. 
The observation of high-gain multimode THz generation from a PPLN 
waveguide is unexpected from Ref. [39] due to the concerns on the destructive phase 
among waveguide modes. This concern can be removed by knowing that not all the 
high-order waveguide modes can be excited, but only those phase-matched modes 
with mode-field distributions similar to the pump field can grow to some appreciable 
energy. Among all the phase-matched modes, odd transverse magnetic (TM) modes, 
having a transverse electric field anti-symmetric to the center of the waveguide gap, 
can not be excited by a TEM00 pump laser well aligned to the core center of a 
waveguide. Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the three labeled spectral peaks 
in Figs 40(a) and 40(b) resulted from the first three even TM modes of the THz waves 
in the PPLN waveguide. Given the mode wavelengths and the waveguide dimensions, 
we deduced the bulk refractive indices mTn ,  of the THz waves from the QPM 
condition, which is given by and the eigen equation of a TM-mode slab waveguide,

In the energy measurement, we could not directly use our DTGS pyroelectric

estimate the actual THz energy by measuring the signal energy. From the slowly

no scattered pump laser can go through the GaAs etalon. Furthermore, the DTGS

Figure 42 The photograph of the experimental configuration of the 532-nm pumped PPLN backward 
TPO. The pump laser was a 532-nm actively Q-switched, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser with a 
10-ns pulse width at a 10-Hz repetition rate. The grating period of the PPLN crystal was 44 µm. A 
copper reflector with a 1.2-mm-diameter aperture was used to reflect the backward-propagating THz 
wave. The wavelengths of the THz wave are measured by the scanning GaAs etalon. 
 
To investigate the backward threshold intensity of the 532-nm pumped backward 
TPO, we measured the signal energy when gradually increasing the energy of the 
pump. Figure 3.6 shows the measured 535.52-nm signal output energy versus the 
pump energy from the 44-µm PPLN crystal pumped by the 532-nm AQS Nd:YAG 
laser. According to the theory of backward OPO, one can realize that the THz and 
signal waves at the same threshold condition. The sensitivity of the DTGS 
pyrodetector is not high enough to investigate the generation of THz-wave in the 
backward collinearly phase-matched configuration. However, we could measure the 
signal energy accurately. Then, the signal was observed when the pump energy 
exceeded ~30 µJ, which indicates a 20-MW/cm2 threshold intensity for the backward 
oscillation. Furthermore, the calculated threshold intensity of the 532-nm-pumped 
backward OPO was consistent with our experimental result.

To verify if the signal wavelength came from Raman scattering and also to 
further investigate the dispersion characteristics of PPLN backward TPO, we 
employed a 1064-nm PQS Nd:YAG laser as the pumping source. The PPLN crystals 
we used for the 1064-nm pumped experiment are the same as those we used in the 
532-nm pumped one. The PQS laser produced 65-µJ/pulse energy at a 1-kHz 
repetition rate. The pulse length of the PQS laser was ~500 ps or ~7 cm in the PPLN 
crystal. For backward-wave oscillator, the group walk-off distance between the THz 
and the pump pulse becomes a more considerable issue than that of a forward 
phase-matched TPG. In addition to the walk-off problem, the longer pump wavelength 
also reduces the parametric gain. Therefore, we can expect higher oscillation 
threshold and/or much lower conversion efficiency. Fortunately, the PQS laser’s 
shorter pulse length and its longer pump wavelength allows us to use higher pump 
intensity without damaging the PPLN crystal. Curves (c) and (d) in Fig. 44 show the 
signal spectra for the 44-µm and 32-µm PPLN crystals, respectively. It is clear that 
the tendency of the wavelength tuning for the 1064-nm backward TPO is the same as 
that for the 532-nm pumped one. The frequency shift for the 1064-nm pumped 
backward TPO is ~ 30 cm-1, whereas that for the 532-nm pumped one is ~ 125 cm-1.

with each other. The reduced spectral width occurred primarily in the 
long-wavelength (right) sides of the two spectra. This confirmed that the high order 
THz modes, corresponding to the long signal wavelengths, were eliminated when the 
thicker PPLN crystal is used. 
 
3. Discussions for the Collinearly Phase-Matched Configuration 
In the forward TPG or backward TPO experiment, we observed that the signal 
wavelength is different from our expectation according to our calculated result. Our 
first speculation is that the dispersion curve could be incorrect. However, the other 
possibility would be the large angular acceptance42. The QPM condition depends on 
the angles between the PPLN grating vector and the three waves’ vectors. The 
implications of this effect are similar to those of the angular dependence of the 
extraordinary index of refraction in a birefrigently phase-matched device. The large 
angular acceptance of the collinearly phase-matched TPG could be easily realized 
because of the small difference of refractive indices between the pump and signal 
waves. 
In a PPLN crystal, the QPM effect and the birefringence effect would occur 
simultaneously. Figure 46 shows the collinearly phase-matched configuration with 
considering QPM and birefringence effects. 
 
 
(a) (b) 
Figure 46 Wave vector diagram for QPM angle tuning analysis. (a) forward collinearly phase-matched 
configuration (b) backward collinearly phase-matched configuration 
 
First, we considered the forward collinearly phase-matched configuration. One 
can obtain the relationship of three waves and grating vector, which is given by

,  (38) 
where k is the wave vector, ?is the angle between the pump and the THz-wave,?is 
the angle between the signal and the THz-wave, (?-?)is the angle between the pump 
and the grating vector, and kgp denotes the grating vector. Figure 47 shows the angular 
acceptance for 80-?m terahertz wavelength, and the pump laser is 532-nm

Furthermore, we considered the angle between the pump laser and the grating 
vector is small enough. Figure 48 shows ?k versus the wavelength and the angle 
between the pump and the signal. The pumping laser is 532 nm, and the domain 
period of the PPLN crystal is 71.5?m. In Figure 48, there are a lot of possibilities to 
achieve the phase-matched condition. That is, the THz-wave would be radiated if its 
gain coefficient reaches the highest. 
From above, it is difficult to tune the radiated THz wavelength by varying the 
grating period due to the large angular acceptance. In addition, the accurate dispersion 
characteristic is not yet available in the THz region. Therefore, one can not choose the 
proper grating period easily to obtain any specific THz wavelength. Unless there is an 
optical resonator for oscillating a specific signal wavelength at a certain angle, only 
the THz radiation with the highest gain would be generated.  
In the THz-wave measurement, there are still some mid-infrared light radiated 
due to higher-order nonlinear-frequency-mixing processes. No suitable material could 
be a filter to block the mid-infrared light and transmit THz waves. In order to obtain a 
good finesse for a scanning etalon without the disturbance of the mid-infrared noises, 
we attempted to set a gold coated grating between the cooper reflector and the first 
concave mirror. The working wavelength range, linear dispersion, and the maximum 
resolution of the grating is between 132 ?m and 600 ?m, 676 nm/mm, and 0.98 
?m, respectively For the unwanted mid-infrared light, the grating provides quite a 
small momentum, thus the whole energy would be distributed into a lot of modes. 
However, the THz-wave would be mostly reflected by the grating in the first order 
direction. Thus, the noise came from the mid-infrared light could be greatly reduced.

 Our accomplishments in the past three years have far exceeded what were 
originally anticipated. Totally, we published one paper in J. OSA (B), two papers in 
Optics Letters, one paper in Optics Express, and several conference papers. On the 
other hand, more interesting problems are also discovered in the past three years. 
Based on this three year’s effort, we will continue to extend our past result, study new 
problem, and set world records in this field.

We derive a coupled-wave theory for backward phase-matched optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators in
a dielectric modulated nonlinear optical material. Unlike a forward phase-matched distributed-feedback opti-
cal parametric oscillator, a backward oscillator of this type can have high-threshold gap modes at Bragg reso-
nance and low-threshold detuned modes. In addition to the structure feedback loop, the internal feedback loop
in the counterpropagating waves strongly influences the resonant-mode formation in this oscillator. A back-
ward distributed-feedback optical parametric oscillator also exhibits the mode-dependent oscillation threshold
similar to that for a distributed-feedback laser and yet has the additional advantage of wavelength selectivity
in a much broader parametric bandwidth. © 2005 Optical Society of America

1. INTRODUCTION
A typical distributed-feedback (DFB) laser has periodic
dielectric modulation in a laser gain medium. Laser oscil-
lation in a DFB laser is established from distributed op-
tical feedback in a dielectric grating along the laser axis.
A semiconductor DFB laser does not require resonator
mirrors and can be fabricated with ease from microlitho-
graphic techniques. Among all the advantages, the most
notable characteristic of a DFB laser is perhaps its mode-
dependent threshold gain, which often results in a single-
frequency laser output.
There has been a goal to seek a laser source with a
single-frequency output at a designated wavelength. Re-
cently the experimental1 and theoretical2 demonstration
of a forward phase-matched DFB optical parametric oscil-
lator (OPO) is one major step toward this goal. Although
implementing reliable dielectric modulation in a bulk or
waveguide nonlinear crystal is still under investigation,
the demonstrated conversion efficiency in a bulk DFB
OPO has been comparable to an ordinary OPO with a
similar material and pump configuration.2,3 With appro-
priate dielectric modulation in a nonlinear optical mate-
rial, a DFB OPO has the advantage of both wavelength
selectivity and mode selectivity, in addition to having the
compact size and simplicity of a DFB laser. An optical
parametric process requires phase matching among the
pump, signal, and idler waves. In a DFB OPO, one of the
two output waves, defined to be the signal wave in this
paper, is further phase matched to the Bragg resonance of
the dielectric grating. Because of a symmetric distributed
optical feedback, the resonant wave or the signal wave in
a DFB OPO travels in both forward and backward direc-
tions. Given a forward pump laser and two possible
propagation directions for the idler wave, there are three
possible phase-matching conditions, one for forward and
two for backward optical parametric processes. The for-
ward DFB optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and oscilla-
tor governed by a phase-matching condition among for-
ward pump, signal, and idler waves have been discussed
elsewhere.2 I present in this paper the analysis of back-
ward DFB OPAs and OPOs with the forward pump phase
matched to a backward signal and a forward idler or with
the forward pump phase matched to a forward signal and
a backward idler. The former is called a backward-signal
OPA and OPO and the latter is called a backward-idler
DFB OPA and OPO in this paper.
Without any structure feedback, a backward-wave os-
cillator builds up oscillation from an internal feedback
loop formed by a forward-propagating pump and a
backward-propagating wave. For a backward-traveling
wave tube or a gyrotron backward-wave oscillator,4,5 the
forward pump is an electron beam and the backward sig-
nal is a microwave. For a backward-wave OPO,6,7 the for-
ward components include a pump laser and a low-
frequency output wave, and the backward component is
another low-frequency output wave. Difference-frequency
generation between the forward pump wave and the
lower-frequency backward wave provides an optical feed-
back to the backward wave; in turn, different frequency
generation between the forward pump and the backward
wave also provides an optical feedback to the lower-
frequency forward wave. Because of this internal feed-
back loop, a backward-wave oscillator does not rely on
electromagnetic feedbacks from physical boundaries and
permits continuous frequency tuning through the phase-
matching bandwidth. With dielectric modulation in a non-
linear gain material, both the internal and the structure
feedbacks can affect the oscillation conditions in a back-
ward DFB OPO. As shown in this paper, the DFB struc-
ture provides another feedback path and therefore addi-
tional flexibility for threshold and mode selections in such
an oscillator.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we de-
rive the coupled-wave equation for the mixing waves in a
dielectric-modulated OPA or OPO. In Section 3 we show
the solutions to the coupled-wave equation for a lossless

Rowe relation9 or photon number conservation for nonlin-

In practice, single-side forward pumping is the most
commonly adopted configuration for an OPA or OPO. To
simplify the analysis, we further assume an undepleted
forward pump wave. This assumption is valid for the fol-
lowing OPO mode analysis because the pump wave re-
mains nearly unchanged before the device starts oscilla-
tion. Substituting Ap

+s0dL are introduced. Therefore z¯=0 and 1 cor-
respond to the locations of the entrance and exit faces of
the device, respectively. Without parametric coupling,
k¯p,s,i=0, Eqs. (9) and (10) are reduced to the coupled-wave
equations for a DFB laser10 with a laser gain coefficient
equal to −as. Without DFB coupling, k¯=0, Eqs. (9) and
(10) are reduced to the coupled-wave equations for an or-
dinary backward OPO.11
It is interesting to note that Eqs. (9) and (10) are dual
equations. In other words, replacing the symbols
fRsz¯d ,Ssz¯d ,Ai
+*sz¯d ,dz¯g with fSsz¯d ,Rsz¯d ,Ai
−*sz¯d ,ds1− z¯dg in
Eq. (9) transforms Eq. (9) into Eq. (10). Given a set of de-
vice parameters, k¯ , k¯s,i , a¯s,i, the field-envelope solution to
a backward-signal DFB OPA and OPO is the same as that
of a backward-idler DFB OPA and OPO under the system-
atic interchange of the symbols. This duality property re-
sults from the fact that the internal feedback loop of a
backward OPO is symmetric to the counterpropagating
signal and idler waves, yielding the same threshold con-
dition for the signal and idler waves [see Eqs. (17)].
For different device parameters, the performance of a
backward OPA or OPO could be quite different. The de-
vice parameters are all functions of wavelength. For ex-
ample, among the device parameters k¯ , k¯s,i , a¯s,i, the loss

DFB oscillator, establishing oscillation from the structure
feedback loop only, usually has a bandgap near the Bragg
resonance d¯=0 due to destructive optical phases at zero
detuning. At d¯=0 the effect of dielectric modulation in a
backward DFB OPO does not completely remove the os-
cillation modes commonly seen in a backward OPO but
increases the threshold of these modes. The threshold in-
crease of the gap modes at d¯=0 can be viewed as a conse-
quence of the competition between the internal feedback
loop and the structure feedback loop.
At the device output, z¯=0 for the backward signal wave
or z¯=1 for the forward signal and idler waves, all three
solution sets of Eqs. (13)–(15) satisfy the condition

as required by the Manley–Rowe relation [Eq. (8)]. Usu-
ally it is difficult to extract signal power in the backward
direction from a backward-wave amplifier. A backward
DFB optical parametric amplifier has the advantage of
coupling some signal power in the forward direction. Fig-
ure 2 shows the ratio of the forward and backward signal
intensities at the outputs of a backward-signal DFB OPA,
IRs1d /ISs0d, as a function of the dimensionless gain G¯ for
the DFB coupling coefficients k¯=1, 2, 3. The thin solid
line marks the level at which the forward signal output
power is equal to the backward signal output power. It
can be seen from this plot that strong DFB coupling helps
forward power extraction in a backward DFB OPA and
weak DFB coupling gives a lower threshold gain for the
Bragg mode in a backward DFB OPO. Given a finite DFB
coupling coefficient, it is possible to produce more forward
signal power than backward signal power in a backward-
signal DFB OPA.
In the above we have limited our OPA analysis at the
Bragg resonance d¯=0. The analytic solutions at zero de-
tuning are useful for comparison with some known prop-
erties of an ordinary backward OPO and a DFB laser. For
d¯Þ0, we show in the following that a backward DFB OPA
and OPO can be high-gain and low-threshold coherent
light sources. By using numerical techniques, we can
solve Eq. (11) to obtain

intensity amplification ratio in an ordinary backward
OPA is Iis1d /Iis0d=sec2sG¯d from Eq. (17c), the contours
relative to the horizontal lines G¯= sm−1dp
+ s0.2,0.4,… ,1.53d give a qualitative gain comparison be-
tween a backward DFB OPA and an ordinary backward
OPA. It is evident from the plots that a backward DFB
OPA operating near d¯=0 and large k¯ is unfavorable in
gain when compared with an ordinary backward OPA, as
noted previously in a comparison of Eqs. (15) and (17).
For k¯=1 in Fig. 3(a), only the Bragg modes, marked by h
at d¯=0, are present in the range of the parametric gain
G¯,13. As k¯ is increased to 3 in Fig. 3(b), the thresholds of
the Bragg modes are increased according to Eq. (16), but
detuned modes are created symmetrically about the d¯=0
line. When the DFB coupling coefficient k¯ is increased to 5
in Fig. 3(c), the thresholds of the Bragg modes become
even higher, but those of the detuned modes are further
reduced. It is interesting to see from Fig. 3 that increas-
ing k¯ moves up the Bragg modes, branches off the oscilla-
tion modes from the d¯=0 line, lowers the threshold of the
detuned modes, and introduces more abrupt changes to
the amplification ratio in the G¯th– d¯ plane. Because k¯ is an
index of the DFB structure feedback strength, the de-
tuned modes, which are gradually generated with in-
creasing k¯, result primarily from the DFB structure feed-
back. In Section 4, however, we show the evidence that, in
addition to the structure feedback loop, the internal feed-
back loop also has a significant influence on those de-
tuned modes. In Fig. 3(c) the two lowest threshold modes
at d¯= ±5.65 have a threshold gain of G¯th=1.15 that is

the level at which the forward signal output intensity is the same
as the backward signal output intensity.

and the threshold gain G¯th of a resonant mode. The matrix

evaluated at z¯=1, where L−1 is the inverse Laplace trans-
form operator and s is the Laplace transform variable.
Since only the parametric gain G¯= suk¯sk¯i
*ud1/2 shows up in
the expression, the pump phase does not affect the mode
locations.
The above mode calculation does not include endface
reflections from the device. To include signal reflections
from the boundaries, we impose the conditions for steady-
state resonance:
Rs0d = r1Ss0d = ˛R1 expsjf1dSs0d at z¯ = 0, s23ad
Ss1d = r2Rs1d = ˛R2 expsjf2dRs1d at z¯ = 1, s23bd
where the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the quantities asso-
ciated with the upstream and downstream endfaces, re-
spectively; r is the reflection coefficient of the signal field;
R is the reflectance of the signal intensity; and f is the
reflection phase of the signal field. Assuming Ai
+*s0d=0 for
self-started oscillation and substituting the boundary con-
dition of Eqs. (23) into Eq. (19), one obtains the steady-
state resonance condition with end reflections:
Ub21s1d˛R1 expsjf1d + b22s1d
b11s1d˛R1 expsjf1d + b12s1d
− ˛R2 expsjf2dU = 0.
s24d
For the case of R1,2=0, Eq. (24) is reduced to the reso-
nance condition without end reflections ub22s1du=0. In a
DFB laser, the end reflections have profound influence on
the mode threshold and the mode frequency because the
longitudinal modes are a consequence of longitudinal
boundary conditions. The symmetry of the mode locations
with respect to Bragg resonance d¯=0 can also be modified
by the optical reflections. While keeping f1=0, r2=0, and
k¯=5, we show in Fig. 5 the mode locations in the G¯th– d¯
plane for R1=0, 12.4%, 50%, and 99%. R1<12.4% is the
optical reflectance at a lithium niobate crystal surface in
air. The arrows in Fig. 5 indicate the moving directions of
the resonant modes when R1 is varied from 0 to 99%. Be-
cause of the additional feedback from the endfaces, the
mode locations in Fig. 5 are no longer symmetric with re-
spect to the zero detuning line. If the additional feedback
phase does not favor the formation of a particular mode
(for example, the Bragg mode), the mode threshold grows
higher because of the reflection feedback. However, with a
correct phase, a small end reflection can greatly reduce
the mode threshold.
From Eqs. (11) and (19), it is straightforward to obtain
the relation b12sz¯d=−b21sz¯d. From Eq. (24), ub21s1dr1
+b22s1du=0 for r2=0 and ub22s1d−r2b12s1du=0 for r1=0 are
symmetric in r1 and r2 under the substitution b12=−b21.
Consequently the plot in Fig. 5 is also valid for the bound-
ary condition f2=0; r1=0; and R2=0 , 12.4%, 50%, 99%.
This property clearly results from a DFB structure that is
symmetric to the forward and backward signal waves.
It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the boundary reflectance
provides only limited tuning to a resonant mode. In a
resonator having longitudinal modes, the resonance fre-
quency of one mode can be tuned to the next one by vary-
ing the longitudinal phase from 0 to 2p. For example, in-
troducing a longitudinal phase of p /2 can create a gap
mode at the Bragg resonance in both a DFB laser13 and a
forward DFB OPO.2 However, a backward DFB OPO be-
haves differently because of the interplay between the in-
ternal feedback loop and the structure feedback loop. Fig-
ure 6 shows the mode loci of a backward-signal DFB OPO
in the G¯th– d¯ plane with k¯=5, R2=0, R1=12.4%, and a

dashed arrows indicate the moving directions of the resonant
modes when R1 is varied from 0 to 99%.

loop for each oscillation mode over a 2p phase change in the lon-

!2pDnl /l0, we kept only the real part of k=2pDnl /l0
− jDal,s when plotting Fig. 7. With some distributed loss
a¯L, the gain and mode dynamics of a backward DFB OPA
and OPO are apparently more complicated. Compared
with Fig. 3(c), Fig. 7 clearly shows reduction in the OPA
intensity amplification ratio for a given pump intensity in
G¯. The thresholds of the resonant modes also become
higher in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7(a) the signal loss a¯L associated
with Eq. (25) tends to smooth out the OPA gain distribu-
tion in the G¯– d¯ plane and slow down the division of the
Bragg modes into detuned modes. In Fig. 7(b) the idler
loss a¯L associated with Eq. (26) tends to localize the OPA
gain and isolate the newly formed detuned modes in the
G¯– d¯ plane. The first oscillation mode in Fig. 7(b) can be
seen to have a threshold lower than that in Fig. 7(a).
Since the abrupt intensity increase near an oscillation
mode is a characteristic of a DFB oscillator and a low os-
cillation threshold is always desirable for an oscillator, it
is therefore apparent that the device configuration asso-
ciated with Eq. (26) is a preferred design for a backward
DFB OPO having long-wavelength loss. The low intensity
gain or the high oscillation threshold resulting from Eq.
(25) is a consequence of the optical loss to the signal am-
plitudes in both forward and backward directions in the
DFB structure. On the other hand, the optical loss in Eq.
(26) is applied to the idler amplitude in only the backward
direction. The device configuration associated with Eq.
(25), although having a higher pump threshold, could still
be useful for applications requiring a broad amplifier
bandwidth.
6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Material dispersion for most known materials imposes a
severe constraint on the mixing frequencies vs!vp ,vi for
a backward-signal DFB OPO or vi!vp ,vs for a
backward-idler DFB OPO. A possible experiment to dem-
onstrate a backward DFB OPO is to employ the periodi-
cally poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal.15 For a
1064-nm pumped backward OPO in a 40-mm period
PPLN crystal, the forward and backward wavelengths
can be 1068 nm and 300 mm, respectively, at 25°C. The re-
fractive index of lithium niobate16 at a 1068-nm wave-
length is 2.16 and that at 300 mm is <5. For l=1 in the
Bragg condition 2b0− lkg=0, the DFB structure period is
247 nm to oscillate the 1068-nm wavelength and is 30 mm
to oscillate the 300-mm wavelength. In lithium niobate,
the Bragg grating can be implemented by the photorefrac-
tive, electro-optic, or acousto-optic technique.2 At a 300-
mm wavelength, an electromagnetic wave is strongly ab-
sorbed in lithium niobate with a field attenuation
coefficient17 of 4.1 cm−1. Therefore a DFB period of 247
nm to oscillate the 1068 nm is the preferred design for
this backward DFB OPO. Using k¯=2.7 scaled from the
demonstrated photorefractive DFB grating in Ref. 1, we
calculated a threshold gain of G¯=2.7 or a threshold inten-
sity of 100 MW/cm2 for a 1-cm-long PPLN crystal. As a
comparison, a threshold intensity of 130 MW/cm2 is re-
quired to achieve backward oscillation in the same PPLN
crystal without a DFB grating. Apparently, the threshold
intensity can be further reduced by use of a longer crystal.
For terahertz nonlinear frequency mixing in lithium nio-
bate, noncollinear phase matching has been a popular
configuration in which the near-infrared output is oscil-
lated at an angle with respect to the near-infrared pump
direction.18 By using a DFB structure in a nonlinear op-
tical material, one is able to collinearly oscillate either the
near-infrared signal or the terahertz wave to maximize
the parametric gain length.
Previously the perfect phase-matching conditions 2b0
− lkg=0 and kp±b07ki=0 were both assumed to obtain
the stationary solutions above. In practice, mode detuning
d¯ could cause a k vector mismatch Dk;kp±b07ki in the
parametric process, and a finite bandwidth is imposed to
the range of frequency detuning. In general, a finite band-
width will further affirm the mode-dependent oscillation
threshold derived above because an oscillation mode out-
side the system bandwidth has an even higher threshold.
On the other hand, as long as the amount of mode detun-
ing d¯ is well within the system bandwidth, the assump-
tion that Dk=0 is insensitive to d¯ is still valid. The system
bandwidth is a combination of intrinsic parametric band-
width, pump bandwidth, DFB grating bandwidth, and
material bandwidth. In the following, we use the pro-
posed backward-idler DFB OPO experiment as an ex-
ample and show how Dk=0 can be satisfied in a typical
experiment.
If mode detuning d¯ causes a signal frequency shift of
Dvs from the Bragg resonance, the corresponding shifts in
the idler and pump frequencies Dvi and Dvp, respectively,
satisfy the expression Dvs+Dvi=Dvp. The resulting k vec-
tor mismatch due to the frequency shifts in a backward-
idler DFB OPO is
Dk = npDvp/c0 − pDLg/Lg
2 + niDvi/c0. s27d
Suppose that the pump is a single-frequency source Dvp
=0 and the mode frequency is detuned by approximately
one free spectral range Dvs,2pc0 /2nsL from the Bragg
resonance. From Eq. (27), the DFB grating bandwidth re-
quired to ensure Dk=0 is
DLg/Lg = sni/nsdsLg/Ld = 5.6 3 10−5, s28d
with Lg=0.25 mm, L=1 cm, and ns=2.2 and ni=5 for the
proposed experiment in lithium niobate. DLg,1.4
310−2 nm yielded from Eq. (28) is probably smaller than
any dimension fluctuation in a microfabrication process,
and the intrinsic DFB grating bandwidth should be large
enough to ensure Dk<0. In addition, for lithium niobate
near 298 K, the DFB grating period varies with tempera-
ture T according to19 DLg /Lg= ,1.1310−5sT−298d, which
allows temperature adjustment within a degree to keep
Dk=0 for a crystal length of L,5 cm.
The pump laser for an OPO usually has multiple longi-
tudinal modes. Assume that a perfect DFB grating is
made in a nonlinear optical material and DLg=0 in Eq.
(27). It is straightforward to show that the following two
equations have to be satisfied to ensure Dk=0:
Dvi =
− np
ni + np

0.5, 0.78, and 1 mm thick LiNbO3 slab waveguides
are 34, 52, and 67, respectively, assuming a refractive
index of 5.4 at 160 m. The confinement of THz
waves in such highly multimode waveguides is still
apparent, because the half-diffraction angle of a THz
wave at 160 m is as large as 100 mrad for a beam
diameter of 300 m. Although there could be con-
cerns regarding the generation of multiple THz-wave
modes from parametric mixing in a submillimeter
LiNbO3 waveguide, it is clear that not all the wave-
guide modes can be excited; only those phase-
matched modes with mode field distributions well
overlapped with the pump field can grow to some ap-
preciable energy. If a TEM00 pump field is aligned to
the waveguide-gap center, an odd TM mode at THz
wavelengths having a transverse electric field anti-
symmetric to the center of the waveguide gap is less
likely to grow. Since the lowest-order TM0 mode has
the largest overlapping integral with a center-aligned
TEM00 pump beam, it is therefore reasonable to as-
sume that most THz output energy is still from the
fundamental TM mode in the multimode nonlinear
waveguides.
Initially, we investigated the waveguide-enhanced
TPG with different waveguide thicknesses. The
waveguide effect is more significant when the pump
beam is well overlapped with the THz waveguide
mode. In the experiment we passed a collimated
pump beam through a 480 m diameter aperture
and transmitted 2.2 mJ of pulse pump energy into
each LiNbO3 slab waveguide. In Table 1 we show the
measured output characteristics of the signal wave
from 0.5, 0.78, and 1 mm thick waveguides under the
same pumping conditions. It is evident from Table 1
that the pump-to-signal energy conversion efficiency
was increased by more than a factor of 2 when the
thickness of the LiNbO3 waveguide was reduced from
1 to 0.5 mm. The 1.61% single-pass parametric effi-
ciency and the generated signal energy from the
0.5 mm thick waveguide have been greatly improved
from previously reported values4 for a 1064 nm
pumped LiNbO3 THz-wave parametric generator at
2.2 mJ pump energy. When the waveguide thickness
was reduced from 1to0.5mm, the signal pulse width
was also reduced from 4 to 2.8 ns. The reduction in
the signal pulse width is a signature of high-gain
parametric generation in the thinner waveguide due
to a highly nonlinear growth rate of the signal wave
in an exponential-gain process. The higher paramet-
ric gain and THz-mode excitation also caused signal
spectral broadening in thinner LiNbO3 waveguides.
In order to investigate the THz-mode frequencies
in the TPG process, we translated the 1 mm thick
LiNbO3 waveguide in the z direction so that the
pump laser was displaced vertically from the
waveguide-gap center. At different vertical positions
the pump laser can selectively excite one or several
high-order THz-wave modes with which the pump la-
ser mode has a good overlap. The slightly different
frequencies of the generated THz modes are encoded
into the signal output spectrum according to the
frequency-conservation law. Figure 2 shows that the
measured center wavelength of the signal output
spectrum indeed varies with the pump displacement
from the waveguide-gap center z, where a positive
z denotes a pump beam above the waveguide-gap
center. As expected, the signal-wavelength shift is
symmetric, about z=0, owing to the symmetry of
the THz-mode field profile about the waveguide axis.
The 23 GHz signal-frequency shift for a pump dis-
placement of z= ±120 m is equal to the frequency
spacing between the TM0 and the TM9 THz-wave
modes. We evaluated the overlapping integrals be-
tween the pump field and the TM mode fields and
found a 15 GHz frequency shift in the signal’s power
spectrum for a 120 m pump displacement from the
waveguide axis. The difference of a few GHz between
the calculated and the measured frequency shifts
could be attributable to the ±8 GHz uncertainty in
the measurement and a numerical model that does
not consider gain and loss of individual waveguide
modes.
We continued to perform THz parametric oscilla-
tion by using two off-axis flat mirrors to oscillate the
Fig. 2. Signal wavelength versus the pump-beam position
relative to the waveguide-gap center in the TPG experi-
ment. A positive z denotes the vertical displacement of the
pump beam above the gap center. The 23 GHz frequency
shift shown in the plot corresponds to the frequency spac-
ing between the TM0 and the TM9 modes for THz waves in
the waveguide.

Abstract: We report a single-longitudinal-mode CW diode-pumped 
Nd:YVO4 laser emitting at both 1064 and 1342 nm with 10% optical 
efficiency at 20-W pump power. The measured spectral widths at 1064 and 
1342 nm were less than 450 MHz and 400 MHz, respectively. The two 
emission wavelengths can be independently tuned over the lasing 
bandwidths of the dual-wavelength laser.

and M3 form a resonator for the 1064-nm laser. M1 and M2 form the 1342-nm laser resonator. 
The smaller coupling loss (8%) at 1342 nm in M2, compared with the higher one (30%) at 
1064 nm in M3, is designed to account for the smaller emission cross section at 1342 nm in a 
Nd:YVO4 crystal. The laser outputs from M2 and M3 are incident on a gold coated grating G 
(1200 grooves/mm) at 85° from the grating normal. High reflectors M4 and M5 reflect the 
−1st-order diffraction of the 1064-nm and 1342-nm lasers, respectively, back to the Nd:YVO4 
crystal to limit the laser linewidths.  At 85° incident angle, the grating feedback to the 
Nd:YVO4 crystal are only about 33 % and 21% for the 1064 and 1342-nm lasers, respectively. 
As a result the primary resonator for the 1064-nm laser is still formed by mirrors M1 and M3, 
and that for the 1342-nm laser is still formed by mirrors M1 and M2. The free-spectral ranges 
of the two primary resonators are 2.3 GHz and 2.5 GHz at 1064 and 1342 nm, respectively. 
The useful laser power is coupled out through the 0th-order diffraction of the grating G. 
Varying the angles of M4 and M5 can independently tune the two output wavelengths near 
1064 and 1343 nm, respectively. According to Ref. [2], if the laser waist ratio of the 1064 and 
1342-nm lasers is slightly larger than unity, the optimal reflectance at the 1064-nm output 
coupler M3 can become fairly independent of the waist ratio for a given output coupling at the 
1342-nm mirror M2. By adjusting the distance between M2 and M3, we set the waist ratio to 
be 1.1 and achieved stable CW lasing at the two wavelengths. The laser operated with TEM00 
modes for both emission lines. The measured polarization directions of the two lines were 
both along the crystal axis of the Nd:YVO4 crystal.

Mirrors M1 and M2 form the 1342-nm laser resonator, and mirrors M1 and M3 form the 1064-
nm laser resonator. Narrow-line optical feedback at 1064 and 1342 nm are provided by M4 and 
M5, respectively, through a grazing-incident grating G. Rotating the angles of M4 and M5 
independently tunes the 1064 and 1342 nm wavelengths, respectively.

circles) output powers versus pump power under single-longitudinal-mode emission. The 
triangles are the measured total laser output power. Indeed, the 1342-nm line reaches the 
lasing threshold first at 4.3-W pump power, and the 1064-nm line has a higher pump threshold 
near 12 W.  As the 1064-nm power builds up, the 1064-nm output power quickly exceeds the 
1342-nm power due to the relatively larger output coupling at 1064 nm. At 20-W pump power, 
the 1064-nm and 1342-nm lasers reach 1.2 W and 0.9 W, respectively. The power stability 
was better than 3 % and 5 % at 1064 and 1342 nm, respectively, over a 1-hour period at 20-W 
pump power.

We report the observation of light-enhanced electro-optic spectral tuning in annealed proton-exchanged,
asymmetric domain-duty-cycle periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) channel waveguides for second-
harmonic generation. The spectral tuning rate was increased rapidly from 0.07 nm/ kV/mm to a saturated
value of 0.32 nm/ kV/mm in a 30%/70% domain-duty-cycle PPLN waveguide when the fundamental pump
power near 1534 nm was increased from 0.6 to 46mW. The second-harmonic laser power at 767 nm was
identified to be the source enhancing the spectral tuning. © 2006 Optical Society of America

Among various nonlinear wavelength conversion
techniques, quasi-phase-matched (QPM) nonlinear
wavelength conversion1 is known to have high effi-
ciency and excellent flexibility. In particular,
waveguide-based QPM wavelength converters have
demonstrated unprecedented, conversion efficiency2
in recent years. To date, the most widely used QPM
nonlinear crystal is periodically poled lithium nio-
bate (PPLN).3 Since lithium niobate is also a good
electro-optic (EO), acousto-optic, and piezoelectric
material, it is possible to integrate multiple material
properties into a single PPLN device to enhance its
functionalities. For example, the EO property of
lithium niobate has been used for demonstrating si-
multaneous amplitude modulation and second-
harmonic generation (SHG) in a monolithic PPLN
crystal.4 An electrode-coated asymmetric-duty-cycle
PPLN crystal was also employed for tuning the wave-
length of an optical parametric oscillator.5
Most published works for EO tuning in QPM ma-
terials were related to bulk PPLN crystals. To lower
the tuning voltage, one approach is to reduce the
bulk-crystal dimension to an optical-waveguide size.
For example, Watts et al.6 demonstrated EO tuning
of phase mismatch of a SHG built upon an
asymmetric-duty-cycle periodically poled lithium
tantalate (PPLT) waveguide. The nonideal spectral
tuning rate, 0.025 nm/ kV/mm, reported by Watts et
al. was attributed to a nearly 50%/50% domain-duty
cycle in the PPLT waveguides. Usually, impurity dif-
fusion is necessary to form a high-index waveguide
channel in a lithium niobate or lithium tantalite
crystal. The material properties, such as the EO and
nonlinear optical coefficients, could be affected by
those impurities. In this Letter, we investigate the
EO tuning of SHG phase mismatch in several
asymmetric-duty-cycle PPLN waveguides. To our
surprise, the spectral tuning rate in an annealed,
proton-exchanged (APE) PPLN waveguide can be
greatly enhanced by laser intensity in the waveguide,
as will be reported below.
EO tuning of the SHG phase mismatch in bulk
PPLN crystals with an asymmetric-duty cycle has
been studied both in theory and experiment with an
externally applied electric field along the crystallo-
graphic z direction.7 For a PPLN crystal exhibiting
photorefractive effects, an internal z-component field
alternating with domain orientation is also present
under laser illumination.8 By taking the total tuning
field as the superposition of the external and internal
electric fields, one can derive from the phase-
matching condition that the total EO tuning of the
fundamental wavelength for the first-order QPM
SHG process in a PPLN waveguide is expressed by

tral tuning rate versus the fundamental power for
this crystal sample. Again, the tuning rate is evi-
dently dependent on the pump power. The spectral
tuning rate was initially pinned at 0.07 nm/ kV/mm
for a fundamental-wave power below 2 mW. When
the fundamental-wave power was increased from 2 to
40 mW, the spectral tuning rate grew rapidly and
saturated at 0.32 nm/ kV/mm. The tuning rate of
this waveguide sample is approximately 1.38 times
that of the previous sample, which agrees well with
the ratio of the two domain length difference L1−L2,
as expected from Eq. (3).
In Eq. (3), the domain length difference L1−L2 is
fixed for a given PPLN crystal and cannot be changed
by the laser power or by the applied electric field. If
the light-enhanced EO tuning rate implies a power-
dependent r33, the nonlinear coefficient d33 and the
SHG efficiency could also depend on the laser power,
regardless of the domain-duty cycle. We therefore
measured the SHG conversion efficiency as a func-
tion of the pump power for our 50%/50% and 70%/
30% duty-cycle PPLN waveguide samples. According
to Eq. (2) and Fig. 2, the laser power in a PPLN
waveguide can induce an internal electric field and
detune the SHG phase-matching wavelength. After
carefully compensating for the detuned wavelength
in our measurement, we found that the SHG conver-
sion efficiencies for both samples stayed fairly con-
stant over the range of our pump power. Therefore
the nonlinear coefficient d33 and thus the EO coeffi-
cient r33 do not depend on the laser power in the
waveguide. To determine whether the pump power at
1.5 m or the SHG power at 0.7 m is responsible for
the enhanced EO tuning rate, we conducted a pump–
probe experiment by first measuring the tuning rate
with 1.5 mW pump power at the 1534 nm phase-
matching wavelength in the 70%/30% duty-cycle
PPLN waveguide and remeasuring it by copropagat-
ing 43 mW laser power at a detuned wavelength
1551 nm into the same waveguide. We found that
the EO tuning rate stayed at the low value of
0.07 nm/ kV/mm with or without the presence of
the 43 mW power at 1551 nm. Therefore the SHG la-
ser at 767 nm is responsible for the enhanced EO
tuning rate in an asymmetric-duty-cycle PPLN wave-
guide. With 40 mW pump power at 1534 nm, there
was approximately 1.5 mW power at 767 nm in the
lithium niobate waveguide.
To estimate the uncertainty in the domain-duty
cycle of our PPLN samples, we also performed an EO
tuning experiment by selecting an 50% /50% duty-
cycle PPLN waveguide sample and found a one-sixth
spectral tuning rate measured for the 65%/35% duty-
cycle PPLN waveguide. Therefore we inferred an un-
certainty of ±2.5% in estimating the domain-duty
cycle. In addition, to avoid any mistake in calculating
the external field Ez,ex, we also reproduced Figs. 3
and 4 by using 500 m thick PPLN waveguide
samples with no cutting trenches on the opposite side
of the waveguides.
In conclusion, we have observed a power-
dependent EO spectral tuning in APE PPLN
waveguides for SHG. The spectral tuning rate in-
creased from 0.07 nm/ kV/mm to a saturated value
of 0.32 nm/ kV/mm when the fundamental pump
power was varied from 0.6 mW to 40 mW in a 70%/
30% duty-cycle PPLN waveguide. The enhanced EO
spectral tuning rate is useful for applications employ-
ing APE PPLN waveguides. Although the mechanism
of the light-enhanced EO tuning in a PPLN wave-
guide is not yet known, we identified that the SHG
laser near 700 nm is responsible for the abnormally
large EO spectral tuning.

Abstract 
We report high-efficiency collinearly phase-matched terahertz-wave parametric 
generation from a 6-cm long, 780-µm thick, 71.5-µm and 67-µm period periodically 
poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide pumped by a ~150 µJ/pulse actively 
Q-switched laser at 532-nm wavelength and by a ~60 µJ/pulse passively Q-switched 
Nd:YAG laser at 1064-nm wavelength, respectively. We measured 80-µm and 330-µm 
terahertz wavelengths from the 532-nm and 1064-nm pumped PPLN crystal, 
respectively. Due to the long gain length and the waveguide-mode confinement, ~nJ 
terahertz radiation at 80-µm wavelength was detected by a pyrodetector with ~150-µJ

phase-matching configuration, where a Nd:YAG laser is polarized along the 
crystallographic z direction and a THz radiation is generated at a ~65° angle from the 
pump laser. This non-collinear phase matching scheme is useful for separating the 
THz wave from the other mixing waves, but severely limits the parametric gain 
length.  
The quasi-phase-matched (QPM) technique [4] permits the use of the largest 
nonlinear coefficient in a nonlinear optical material with a non-critically phase 
matched configuration, leading to the demonstration of numerous wavelength-tunable 
and high-efficiency coherent light sources5,6. Periodically poled lithium niobate 
(PPLN), a popular QPM crystal, has been used for demonstrating non-collinearly 
phase-matched surface emitting THz via difference frequency generation7. Ding et 
al.8 also proposed collinearly phase-matched THz difference frequency generation in 
PPLN crystals, which has the advantage of a longer gain length and thus a lower 
pump power for a given conversion efficiency. Moreover, the thickness of PPLN 
crystals is usually in the range of 500-1000 µm, forming a waveguide at THz 
wavelengths. The waveguide confinement for the THz radiation could greatly enhance 
the efficiency of the nonlinear frequency conversion. In this letter, we take advantage 
of the long gain length and mode confinement in a collinearly phase-matched PPLN 
multimode waveguide and demonstrate efficient THz parametric generation with a 
niobate. We operated the pump laser at a 5-Hz repetition rate. The 5-ns pump pulse is 
much longer than the walk-off distance between the THz wave and the optical waves 
in the 6-cm PPLN crystal. To prevent laser damage, we limited the pump intensity to 
be less than 200 MW/cm2 or the pump energy to be less than 150 µJ for a laser waist 
radius of 100 µm in the PPLN crystal. To separate the THz radiation from the pump 
and the idler waves, we installed a 45o optically polished copper reflector with a 
1.2-mm-diameter aperture in the downstream of the experiment. The distance between 
the copper reflector and the PPLN crystal output was 5 cm. The pump and idler waves, 
both in the visible spectrum, were transmitted through the aperture, whereas the THz 
wave was mostly reflected by the copper reflector due to fast diffraction. Given a THz 
wavelength of ~80 µm and a beam diameter of ~ 780 µm at the PPLN crystal output, 
we estimated that more than 96% of the generated THz energy was reflected by the 
copper reflector. We employed two concave metallic mirrors, each having a 40-cm 
radius of curvature, to collimate and collect the THz radiation into a deuterated 
triglycine sulfate (DTGS) pyrodetector. A scanning GaAs etalon was installed 
between the two concave mirrors for measuring the THz wavelength. The scanning 
etalon consists of two optically polished, 0.633-mm thick GaAs plates with a variable 
air gap. Since the absorption coefficient of GaAs at the 532-nm wavelength is 80000 
cm-1 10, no scattered pump laser or idler can go through the GaAs etalon. Furthermore, 
pulse length of the PQS laser was only ~500 ps or ~7 cm in the PPLN crystal, which 
was about the walk-off distance between the THz and the pump pulse. Because of the 
shorter pulse length and longer pump wavelength, we were able to use a pump 
intensity of 700 MW/cm2 without damaging the PPLN crystal. Figure 3(b) shows that 
the idler spectrum of the 1064-nm pumped TPG was centered at 1067.4 nm, implying 
a characteristic THz wavelength of 334 µm at the output. This time we only observed 
a peak signal-to-noise ratio of ~2 in the DTGS pyrodetector when performing the 
scanning etalon measurement. The reduced signal-to-noise ratio is attributable to the 
walk-off of the THz signal, the poor response of the DTGS pyrodetector near 300-µm 
wavelengths and to the sub-ns THz pulse width, and some scattered noises at 1-µm 
wavelengths. 
We further fabricated a 4-cm long and 780-µm thick PPLN crystal with a domain 
period of 80 µm. By replacing the 67-µm-period PPLN crystal with the 80-µm-period 
one in the PQS-laser pumped TPG experiment, we observed the idler wavelength 
shifted from 1067.4 nm to 1067.3 nm, corresponding to the THz wavelength shifted 
from 334 µm to 344 µm. This result indicates that lithium niobate is not very 
dispersive in this part of the THz spectrum. We also observed a factor two increase on 
the idler intensity due to the reduced walk-off problem in a shorter crystal. 
Compared to the idler spectra previously reported for TPG experiments11, the 
and (b) resulted from the first three even TM modes of the THz wave in the PPLN 
waveguide. From the known mode wavelengths and the waveguide dimensions, we 
deduced the bulk refractive indices of the THz waves from the QPM condition, Eq. (1) 
and the eigen equation12 of a TM-mode slab waveguide. Table I summarizes the 
deduced extraordinary refractive indices and their corresponding THz wavelengths. 
Near the 70-µm and 300-µm THz wavelengths, the bulk refractive indices are about 
the same as the corresponding mode indices mTn , , as expected for the low-order 
waveguide modes. The generated THz wavelengths and the deduced refractive indices 
are somewhat different from the predictions in Ref. [8] based on curve fitting for the 
discrete refractive-index data in Ref. [9]. The TPG experiments in PPLN crystals 
showed a reliable and convenient way for measuring the refractive index of LiNbO3 
in the THz spectrum. 
Our DTGS pyroelectric detector was not calibrated for THz waves. We estimated 
the generated THz energy from the measured idler energy according to the following 
equations. From the slowly varying plane-wave model for parametric generation, the 
idler intensity iI  and the THz intensity TI  along the collinear direction z are

excitation of THz waveguide modes in the 780-µm thickness PPLN crystal. The high 
efficiency is attributable to the collinear phase-matching configuration and the 
waveguide mode confinement. For the first time to the best of our knowledge, 
nJ-level THz energies were directly measured by a pyrodetector with a kW-level 
optical pump power in lithium niobate. Our experiment also shows the potential of 
high-repetition-rate THz generation by using a relatively low-power and compact 
passively Q-switched Nd:YAG laser as a pump source.
