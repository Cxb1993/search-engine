1. Introduction 
Falls are the leading cause of death and injury in the workplace (LMRIS, 
2010; Chang et al., 2009). The 2010 Workplace Safety Index (LMRIS, 2010) 
shows that “fall to the same level” and “fall to a lower level” ranked second 
and fifth in the top 10 causes of disabling injuries in the United States. Beyond 
the human tragedy, they represented a major cost to US businesses and 
industry with 8.37 billion (15.7 %) and 5.29 billion (9.9 %) of direct US 
compensation costs in that year. The cost of the combined fall categories, 13.67 
billion USD, slightly exceeded the costs of overexertion. This demonstrates 
that falls, when considered together, were comparable to overexertion in 
terms of impact on the overall cost burden. The guidelines for labor protection 
measures in high-rise workplaces have been enforced in Taiwan (CLA, 1997). 
However, the annual report of the labor inspection in Taiwan showed that in 
2008 more than 115 high-rise building construction workers were fatally 
injured in the workplace (CLA, 2009), which corresponds to a fatal injury 
incidence rate of 1.62 per 100,000 workers. As a comparison, in the UK, the 
number of workers fatally injured in 2009/10 regardless of industry or 
occupation was 152, which corresponds to a fatal injury incidence rate of only 
0.5 per 100,000 workers (HSE, 2010). Since concerns on falling are the primary 
source of stress for workers at height (Chang et al., 2009), it is essential to 
investigate the working postures and the potential risks of losing balance in 
high-rise workplaces.    
The mounting of an electric transmission tower is a high-risk operation 
within a highly restricted workspace. This study focuses on the mounting of 
electric transmission towers. The island of Taiwan alone has more than 10,000 
transmission towers, among which several hundred must be rebuilt or 
maintained annually. This tall structures is usually steel lattice towers used to 
support overhead electricity conductors for electric power transmission. They 
come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Their typical height ranges from 
15 to 55 meters. Transmission towers are set up in remote areas as part of the 
work at a power plant site. In such areas, it is not possible to use a crane. All 
steel parts must be lifted using a small winch, and workers must climb up and 
down. Extreme weather conditions such as thermal or cold stress and strong 
winds increase the challenges faced by the workers (Kirk and Sullman, 2001). 
Since fall hazards cannot be completely eliminated, workers wear fall 
protection harnesses at all times, limiting their reachability and the degrees of 
freedom for all parts of the body (Hsiao et al., 2003).  
While working on the structure of a transmission tower with a restricted 
working platform, workers do not have the luxury of taking appropriate 
stepping actions to increase their support base during the work. Therefore, 
manual tasks involving lifting, lowering, screwing, and/or body transfer 
constantly put workers at risk of losing their balance, which may result in a 
near fall and/or an actual fall event with possible serious injuries (Mao et al., 
2000). In addition, a loss of balance may cause the trunk muscles to

afternoons.  
Participants wore long-sleeved shirts and trousers. The handling of steel 
parts requires high force exertions, and during the recording period, 
participants would change their wet clothes daily at lunch time, which 
demonstrates the heaviness of the workload. Most of the time, workers wore a 
safety belt as a fall protection device, thus limiting their reachability and the 
degrees of freedom for all parts of the body.

2.3 Recording of working postures  
Participants’ working postures were recorded during three days. The 
working height was approximately 20, 35, and 50 meters measured from the 
base of the tower. Two SONY digital video cameras were used continuously 
by two cameramen to record the working postures of each participant from 
8:00-12:00 am and 1:00-5:00 pm on three consecutive days. Only the lateral 
view of the participants was recorded. After each recording, the name of the 
cameraman, the participants, the time, and date of the recordings were kept 
on record for further analysis. The working postures of each participant were 
sampled every 10 seconds and were coded according to the coding system 
below.  
2.4 Coding system for working postures  
A coding system was developed to meet our special purpose based on 
the working envelope concept of Adams (2006). We used a seven digit system 
to record the tasks, the working envelopes, the force exertion, the safety belt 
be used, upper-extremity safety maneuvers, as well as the lower-extremity 
maneuvers of the trunk. The coding system is listed in Table 1, comprising 
five task categories: safety belt use, materials handling, screwing, body 
transfer, and idle.  
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
Insert Table 1 here 
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
We identified six working envelopes according to the physical location of 
the task: near-middle, near-high, near-low, far-middle, far-high, and far-low. 
A reach distance of more than 18”, required for the extension of upper-arm 
and/or some movement of the trunk, was categorized as a far reach. A 
working level higher than that of a participant’s “shoulder height” was 
considered a “high” level; whereas a working level lower than that of “hip 
height” was considered a “low” working level. See Figure 2 for the definition 
of the different working envelopes. 
Among the six, only the near-middle envelope was considered a

3. Results 
A total of 3,039 working postures were coded, excluding those that could 
not be identified clearly from the lateral viewing pictures. Table 2 lists the 
sampled task categories in the mounting of an electrical transmission tower. 
In all, materials handling accounted for 35.0 % of the tasks, while 36.9 % of the 
tasks were related to screwing. Body transfer accounted for 9.6 % of the tasks. 
Workers were idle for 13.9 % of the time. Most of this time, they had to wait 
for the arrival of material supplies or for another team member to finish their 
task before the next could be undertaken. Though resting periods lasted no 
more than 2-3 minutes, they were sufficiently frequent to provide workers 
with a short break.  
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
Insert Table 2 here 
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
The data in table 2 also present the physical locations of the sampled 
tasks. In all, 51.6 % of the tasks were located in the near-middle envelope, 
which was the most economic in terms of motion requirement. However, 7.7 
% of the tasks were conducted in the far-high envelopes and 9.5 % in the 
far-low envelopes. A total of 17.2 % of the tasks required the use of the 
extended arm and the bending/twisting of the trunk whenever necessary. 
Force exertions showed that 46.7 % of the tasks were performed using the 
wrist, 25.5 % using the arm/arms, and 27.8 % involved using the trunk.   
Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of the use of body parts while 
performing different tasks for each working envelope. The results show that 
27.1 % of the material handling tasks were performed in either the far-high 
(13.3 %) or the far-low (13.8 %) envelopes, and that 40.2 % of the tasks 
required the use of the trunk. When screwing tasks were performed, 17.5 % of 
the tasks were performed in the far-high and far-low working envelopes. 
Force exertions were done mainly using wrist (34.7 %) and arm/arms (44.0 
%).

--------------------------------------------------------------- 
To minimize the risk of falling, workers are required to wear safety belts 
at all times. Nevertheless, the sampling results show that the belt was not 
used 16.8 % of the time. This includes 3.2 % for materials handling, 3.4 % for 
screwing, and 7.5 % for body transfer. Non-use of safety belt occurred mostly 
in the case of body transfer. The belt protects workers from falling; however, 
21.2 % of the time the belt was used as an extended weight-hanging and body 
support system enabling the hands of the worker to be free to perform the 
tasks.

4. Discussion 
When working on the structure of an electric transmission tower, 
workers are forced to perform their tasks while being at the outer edge of 
their stability boundary. Our examination shows that 17.2 % of the tasks are 
conducted in far-high and far-low envelopes, and furthermore, that 25.5 % of 
the tasks are performed with the use of arm/arms and 27.8 % using the trunk. 
A former study by Steven and Mohamed (1979) showed that tasks considered 
easy at the ground-level become more difficult when performed at 
high-elevation workplaces. Our study shows the additional efforts made by 
the worker to secure safety while working in the far-high and far-low 
envelopes up in the tower, thus adding additional loads to tasks that are 
already challenging. When the arm/arms and the trunk move forward, 
upward, and downward, this increases the risk of approaching the center of 
gravity of a worker or even of crossing the stability boundary. In this case, a 
small perturbation in the body motion (such as a sudden move or a shift of 
the load being handled) and/or a reduction in the friction coefficient of the 
standing/walking surfaces could easily jeopardize the worker’s ability to 
maintain his balance (Bhattacharya et al., 2009). Working in these envelopes, 
one’s perception of a postural threat should elicit appropriate corrective 
postural muscle contractions. The corrective postural muscle action reduces 
the postural sway response and minimizes postural instability (Bhattacharya 
et al., 2009).            
In our study, material handling is the most frequent task (35.0 %). This 
includes the following: (1) lifting, moving, and positioning parts of steel 
structures into an exact location; and (2) lifting, moving, and unloading the 
screws, nuts, and tools in a basket. To accomplish the task, it is sometimes 
necessary to shift the body. However, using a safety belt limits the reach 
capability and the degrees of freedom for body movement. This explains our 
findings that 27.1 % of the tasks are performed in either the far-high or 
far-low envelopes, and that 40.2 % of the tasks require the use of the trunk, 
which may result in a near fall and/or in an actual fall event. Although a 
safety belt is used to minimize safety hazards, 25.8 % of the time the belt is 
actually used as a body support mechanism instead of as a safety device, and 
9.2 % of the time the belt is not used at all. In these cases, horse-ride standing 
and/or prone lying on the steel structure frees the hand/arm to perform the 
task. Both of these compensatory maneuvers are attempts to lower the center 
of gravity of the system and to increase the BOS to minimize postural 
instability. However, they require more muscle efforts. Potten et al. (1999) 
showed in a previous study that when reaching forward, workers rely 
significantly more on non-postural muscle compensation to maintain their 
 10
Slips and falls occur because of many factors. It is erroneous to assume 
that slips are due entirely to the coefficient of friction value of the shoe-floor 
surface. Slips may be caused by distractions, postural adjustments required to 
maintain balance, or differences in gait patterns during body transfer. 
Information from visual and auditory cues, and to some extent tactile 
sensations, provides impressions of the level of slipperiness (Cohen and 
Cohen, 1994). To be able to see clearly is of vital importance, especially in the 
case of a false step or a trip. Unfortunately, poor weather conditions such as 
wind, fog, and raining in mountain areas increase the difficulties of 
perception. It is always good practice to stop the operation immediately in 
case of poor weather conditions to minimize risks. 
This study has several limitations. Firstly, the sample is limited to 3,039 
working postures among 12 participants over 3 working days. The video 
recording of the working postures was restricted by the viewing angle of the 
cameras and the height of each workplace. In addition, only good-quality 
recording of working postures were sampled and coded. Secondly, tour study 
focuses on stress arising from physical work or a particular working posture. 
Psychological stress when working at a height should be considered when 
estimating the workload of the mounting of a tower. Finally, our study does 
not identify muscle kinematic and kinetic changes consistent with a more 
“cautious“ working posture and/or a “near miss” scenario, which present 
additional loads to already challenging tasks. More specifically, when facing a 
potential risk, awareness of a potential slip primarily alters how the body 
parts approach the steel part of the tower structure, changing the anticipatory 
muscle activation of hand/arm, trunk, leg, and foot.  
Conclusions 
By coding various working envelopes, force exertion using different body 
parts, and safety maneuvers for work on electric transmission towers at 20, 35, 
and 50 meters, the findings of this study provide important input for the 
design of fall prevention campaigns. The results confirm that workers are 
exposed to risk factors of restricted workspace, uneven walking surfaces, and 
poor environmental conditions, and that they perform heavy manual 
materials handling, screwing, and body transferring tasks. Our examination 
of the working envelopes shows that 17.2 % of the tasks are conducted in the 
unbalance and instability areas, and furthermore, that 25.5 % of the tasks are 
performed with the use of arm/arms and 27.8 % using the trunk. Though a 
safety belt exists to prevent falls, it is not used 16.8 % of the time, and 21.2 % 
of the time the belt is used instead as an extended weight hanging and body 
supporting system while the workers’ hands, trunks, and legs are used as a 
supplementary supporting system. This increased burden on the non-postural 
muscle causes overstress. We recommend that a High Reliability 
Organization be established for each team. Further, positioning the steel parts 
exactly before screwing, as well as adopting conservative gait patterns and 
planning a route before body transfer, will help minimize the risk of a slip or
