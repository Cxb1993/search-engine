二、英文摘要 
In the research, a modified histogram equalization for contrast enhancement of monochrome 
image/frame is proposed and publishied in VLSI Design/CAD 2008. We use the sampled and 
quantized image to create the look-up table and apply the table to obtain the enhanced image. The 
features of the modified scheme are as follows: 1) As compared with the original scheme by the 
MATLAB simulation, the differences in enhanced images are tiny and indistinguishable by our 
eyes. 2) For the requirement of real-time processing, the proposed sampling and quantization 
techniques are more suitable for pipelining in hardware design. Verification of the proposed 
four-stage pipeline design with FPGA design flow shows that the proposed design is adequate for 
most of surveillance system; even if the frame size of video is larger than HDTV. 
關鍵詞： 
Contrast enhancement、Histogram equalization、Sampling and quantization、Pipeline design、

creation of look-up table by MHE, both the number 
of pixels and the size of grey levels are reduced. No 
matter for monochrome or colour frame, the 
reduction will make we can design more effective 
pipeline architecture.  
III. MATLAB SIMULATION RESULTS 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
MHE, MATLAB simulations are performed. In the 
simulations, four images “Pentagon”, “Brick wall”, 
“Truck and APCs”, and “Girl: Elaine” of size 
512×512 pixels are used. They are all downloaded 
from a database in Signal & Image Processing 
Institute of University of  Southern California [9].  
To sample the original image f by row sampling 
rate 1/p and column sampling rate 1/q, and quantize 
fS by the quantization step size QL,  we consider 
the cases of  p = q = 1, 2, ", 7 and QL = 1, 2, 4. 
As a representative, some enhanced results of  
“Pentagon” are shown in Fig. 1. Notice that the 
case p = q = 1 and QL = 1 is just the original 
histogram equalization scheme. 
To measure the difference of enhanced results 
between the OHE and the proposed MHE, the mean 
absolute difference (MAD) is computed. Let OHEenhf  
be the enhanced result of the image f by OHE and 
MHE
enhf  be the one by MHE. The MAD of
OHE
enhf  
and MHEenhf is defined as

M N
− −
= =
≡ −× ∑∑ . 
To sample a row and a column from every 
non-overlapping  p rows and q columns, 
respectively, there are pq different kinds of 
sampling possibilities. Applying MHE to each 
sampling possibility in four images, we can obtain 
4pq MADs and then compute the expected value 
and standard deviation for 1 ≤ p, q ≤ 7 under 
different QL. Tables I, II, and III show the results 
for QL =1, 2, and 4, respectively. 
From Figure 1, the enhanced results by MHE 
shown in Figs. 1(c)-(h) under different parameters 
are indistinguishable from the result by OHE 
shown in Fig. 1(b). It also can be confirmed by the 
quantitative results listed in Tables I-III. Table I 
indicates that, for QL =1, the expected values of 
MAD range from 0.0519 to 0.8248 and the standard 
deviations range from 0.0450 to 0.5513 for 1 ≤ p, q 
≤ 7 and   (p, q) ≠ (1, 1). The expected values of 
MAD increase very slowly as p and q increase. 
When (p, q) equals  (7, 7), the small average grey 
level fluctuation 0.8248 in each pixel is 
indistinguishable by our eyes certainly. Even in the 
case QL = 4, Table III indicates µ = 2.8787 and σ = 
1.0317 for p = q = 7. Human eyes are hard to 
distinguish the difference in grey level just as we 
are hard to distinguish Fig. 1(h) from Fig. 1(b).

V. DESIGN VERIFICATION 
For the application of surveillance system with 
the specification of CIF frame size and 30 fps, we 
verify the MHE design on the Quartus-II FPGA 
EDA tool with Altera stratix  EP1S80F1508I7 
FPGA. The simulation results are listed in Tables 
IV-VI. From Tables IV and V, we can see that the 
throughput is increased from 876.36 fps to 3546.1 
fps with few additional hardware when the 
sampling technique with p=q=2 is adopted. If both 
the sampling and quantization techniques with  (p, 
q, QL) = (2,2,2) are adopted, Tables IV and VI 
show that the throughput is increased from  
876.36 fps to 4018 fps, and the hardware cost is 
reduced from 26098 LEs to 14857 LEs. The 
performance improvement from the proposed 
sampling and quantization techniques is obvious 
and significant.

VI. CONCLUSION 
In the research, a modified histogram 
equalization has been proposed. The qualitative and 
quantitative results from the MATLAB simulation 
show the enhanced images by the MHE are very 
similar to the ones by the OHE. Besides, the 
four-stage pipeline architectures of MHE for (p, q, 
QL) = (1,1,1), (2,2,1), and (2,2,2) have been 
designed. The FPGA simulation result shows that 
the design for the OHE (i.e. (p, q, QL) = (1,1,1)) 
works at the throughput of 876.36 fps and the 
hardware cost of 26098 LEs, and the design for the 
proposed MHE with (p, q, QL) = (2,2,2) can work 
at the throughput of 4018 fps with less hardware of 
14857 LEs. Obviously, the proposed sampling and 
quantization techniques result in significant 
performance improvement. Although the other 
related designs are in progress, based on the above 
investigation, we draw the following inferences. (i) 
If p, q, and QL are larger than 2, much better 
performance improvement can be obtained. (2) The 
designs for the colour frame can also benefit from 
the proposed sampling and quantization techniques. 
Finally, it is believed that most of the application of 
surveillance system for real-time processing can 
benefit from the proposed MHE design; even if the 
frame size is larger than HDTV.

Cryptographic System (CCCS)
Wei-Jian Lin and Jui-Cheng Yen
Department of Electronic Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan.
• A new integrating channel coding and cryptography design for wireless local area networks is proposed.
– A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) encoder which is composed of a selectable CRC bank is placed in front of 
the encryptor in the proposed design. .
– The calculated CRC codes together with the input data packet are sent to the encryptor .
• The cryptanalyses on brute-force attack indicate that the proposed design is a strict cipher and has 
higher security than the conventional one. 
• The simulation shows that the proposed design has a good ability in error detection and the detection 
ability is enhanced when the longer length of CRC code is employed .
3. Cryptanalyses
5. Conclusions
4. MATLAB Simulations
• The proposed design is a strict cipher and has higher security than the conventional encoder.
• The design achieve a good performance in error detection when the longer length of CRC code is used.
• When the system is used in low SNR environment, the longer the CRC code length could be selected to 
keep the detection performance in a prescribed undetected rate. 
• The proposed structure can easily be modified to combine the CRC bank with other encryptors to 
enhance the security.
