measuring their responsivty and using the two proposed theories to fit the results. Moreover, we 
examine the current transport mechanisms of different surface treated samples by specific contact 
resistivity versus temperature measurement. 
 
 
II. Experiment 
We prepare several kinds of GaN MSM detectors as shown in Fig.3. and the MSM patterns 
are interdigitated as showed in Fig.4. Among all, the MOCVD GaN films are grown on sapphire 
by standard metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and the concentration of MOCVD 
GaN films are all n-type 1.3x1017 (cm-3) in our experiment. Besides, the sputtered GaN films are 
deposited by sputter of our lab. The sputtering parameters are as follows:(1)unintentional substrate 
heating (2) the distance between the gun and the substrate~2cm (3) the ratio of Ar:N =78:22 and 
the pressure is maintained around 1.9x10-2 Torr (4) the RF=150watt (5) deposition rate~80Å/min. 
Furthermore, the sputtered GaN films of Fig.3 (b) are annealed at 800oC in N2 ambiance for 1hr. 
But the sputtered GaN films of the other structure as showed in Fig.3 (c) are as-deposited and not 
annealed. After preparing all kinds of the GaN films, the MSM Ni/Au interdigitated electrodes are 
coated on the GaN films by e-beam coater and Ni/Au ratio are 25Å/3000Å. Then all kinds of MSM 
GaN photodetectors are done. On the other hand, we use the CTLM to measure the specific contact 
resistivity versus temperature for finding out the current transport mechanism of different surface 
treated samples and the metal materials of the CTLM electrodes(as showed in Fig.5) are 
Ti/Al(200Å/3000Å). 
    After all samples preparation and fabrication are finished, we measure the responsivity of all 
kinds of GaN MSM detectors by the monochromator and HP4145B semiconductor analyzer and 
use the proposed theories to fit the measured results. Moreover, the specific contact resistivity 
versus temperature measurement is taken by HP4145B semiconductor analyzer and heating the 
substrates.

decrease as the sputtered GaN thickness increases on the MOCVD films. This is because the 
sputtered GaN film has poor photoresponse so the responsivity decreases with increasing the 
sputtered GaN thickness on MOCVD films.  
     After the discussion of the measured responsivity, the fitting responsivity results are 
dicussed as below. At first, Fig.10 shows the measured curves and the fitting responsivity curves of 
the 300Å sputtered GaN/MOCVD GaN MSM detectors which has highest responsivity values and 
it exhibits that the measured responsivity versus voltage curve of this detector is roughly linear and 
it coincides with the fitting curve of the theory J.C.C. as the recombination life time τ or t is 
4.23ms. Besides, the theory O.K. doesn’t fit the measured curve well even modulating the 
concentration Nss of the hole capture traps. Furthermore, the measured curves of the other surface 
treated detectors also coincide with the theory J.C.C. as shown in Fig.11 and the responsivity 
values decrease with increasing the sputtered GaN thickness on MOCVD GaN films as above 
discussion, too. In Fig.11, It also exhibits that the recombination life time decrease as the sputtered 
GaN thickness increases on the MOCVD GaN films. It could be attributed to that the sputtered 
GaN film has large defects and poor conductivity so it increases the carrier recombination 
opportunity and reduces the recombination time. On the other hand, the J.C.C. theoretical fitting 
curves of the pure MOCVD GaN detectors in Fig.12 doesn’t fit well compared with the surface 
treated ones. But the tendency of the measured curves is more corresponsive to the J.C.C. 
theoretical fitting curves much than the O.K. theoretical fitting curves. Therefore, the internal gain 
mechanism and formula of the J.C.C. theory are not completely suitable for the pure MOCVD 
GaN detectors. 
       Finally, the specific contact resistivity versus temperature is showed in Fig.13. It exhibits 
that the specific contact resistivity of the surface treated samples are less temperature dependent so 
the current transport mechanisms are tunneling10) and it coincides with the J.C.C. theory. In the 
case of the pure MOCVD sample, it is more temperature dependent and it indicates that its current 
transport mechanism is thermionic or thermionic/field emission10).
