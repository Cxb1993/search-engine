Abstract 
Since most manufacturers promote ISO/TS16949 quality system certification 
process through the help of external counselors, this study focuses upon the auditors of 
ISO/TS 16949 as the primary objects of the research, in contrast to previous studies 
targeting certified manufacturers. Collecting data through questionnaire surveys, this 
study first utilizes Kano’s model to discover the main factors identified as potential 
improvements by ISO/TS 16949, then uses FAHP to rank the importance of these 
factors, and finally introduces the QFD relation matrix to discuss the key factors to a 
successful implementation of ISO/TS 16949 certification. The results show that two 
remarkable improvement factors of enterprises promoting ISO/TS 16949 certification 
lie in identifying internal customers to meet the requirements to complete product, and 
identifying production and service supply processes to meet the requirements. Results 
acquired from QFD further show that Customer information collection, internal auditing 
capability, and statistical analysis capability are the necessary technical demands to 
achieve these essential improvements. The results can help enterprises effectively 
allocate resources to implement the quality system of ISO/TS 16949. 
 
Keywords: ISO/TS 16949, Kano’s Model, FAHP, and QFD  
 
1. Introduction 
ISO/TS 16949 is stipulated by the International Automotive Task Force (IATF), 
integrating quality management standards from QS 9000 (North America), VDA6.1 
(Germany), EAQF (France) and AVSQ (Italy) (Chrysler Corporation et al., 1998). It is a 
set of commonly accepted worldwide technical standard developed in accordance to the 
experiences and essences of automobile industries in America, Europe and Japan. Based 
upon the foundation of ISO 9001, ISO/TS 16949 shares the chief spirit of requiring 
businesses to continuously improve themselves and further satisfy customer 
  3
suggestions for such enterprises, and to be applied for subsequent research. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, related literatures about 
ISO/TS 16949, Kano’s model and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process are reviewed.  
Methodology employed to obtain critical factors is provided in Section 3. Sampling, 
data collection and analysis results are demonstrated in Section 4. Conclusions and 
suggestions are derived accordingly in Section 5.  
 
2. Literature review  
2.1 ISO/TS 16949 Quality Management System  
ISO/TS 16949, which integrates a series of standards in automobile quality from 
various countries, realizes the aim of only one automobile regulation used in the world 
and reduces unnecessary wastes of suppliers. Franceschini (2004) believes that passing 
ISO/TS 16949 certification represents that the quality management system of an 
enterprise has reached the standard level. ISO/TS 16949 is a new standard developed for 
the automobile industry on the basis of ISO 9000. Since being published and executed, 
it has gradually become a quality assurance abided by internal and external 
collaborating factories. In accordance with previous standards applied in automobile 
industry, such as QS 9000 (North America), VDA6.1 (Germany), EAQF (France) and 
AVSQ (Italy), ISO/TS 16949 standardizes the quality system requirements of the 
automobile industry in relation to development and production, design, and service. 
Moreover, the launch of ISO/TS 16949:2002 (Reid, 2005) in March, 2002, after 
learning from experience and extracting the essences of the automobile industries in 
America, Europe and Japan, ultimately creates a more comprehensive ISO/TS 16949 
and brings innovative change to the global automobile industry . 
ISO/TS 16949 is created on the basis of ISO 9001, following operation of overall 
continuous improvement and circulation of PDCA, and is composed of original articles 
in ISO as well as special supplement requirements regarding automobile industry as 
described in notes. ISO/TS 16949 puts production capability, quality, cost, delivery, 
morale and security of the interior of enterprises into practice, causes increase in above 
aspects by using quality operation and management methods to the exterior of 
enterprises, pursuing the final goal of achieving customer satisfaction, is composed of 
original articles cited from ISO and special supplement requirements regarding 
automobile industry as described in notes and the five tools, Advanced Product Quality 
Planning (APQP), Production Parts Approval Process (PPAP), Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA), Statistic Process Control (SPC), and Measurement System Analysis 
(MSA), as well as defines that quality management system regarding production on 
automobile spare parts is applicable to the supply chain in the whole automobile 
industry. ISO/TS 16949 mainly aims to highlight the development of quality 
management system on deficiency prevention, continuous improvement provision, and 
  5
presented. Five classifications are divided with the relative relations in the coordinates. 
1. Attractive quality attributes: attributes that give satisfaction if present, but 
produce no dissatisfaction if absent; 
2. One-dimensional quality attributes: attributes that are positively and linearly 
related to customer satisfaction—that is, the greater the degree of fulfillment, 
the greater the degree of customer satisfaction; 
3. Must-be quality attributes: attributes whose absence will result in customer 
dissatisfaction, but whose presence does not significantly contribute to 
customer satisfaction; 
4. Indifferent quality attributes: attributes whose presence or absence does not 
cause any satisfaction or dissatisfaction to customers; and 
5. Reverse quality attributes: attributes whose presence causes customer 
dissatisfaction, and whose absence results in customer satisfaction.

Figure 1. Kano’s Model (Kano et al.,1984) 
 
Kano’s model is applied to the areas of research and development of products 
(Marzler and Hinterhuber, 1998); otherwise, Schvaneveldt et al. (1991) applies this 
model into service industry to discuss four service industries including bank, laundry, 
restaurant and supermarket; Tontini(2000) also adjusts Kano’s model to discuss service 
quality and improvement index in restaurant.; Zhang(2002) understands the expectation 
of users to quality factors on websites by using Kano’s model. Kano’s model is widely 
applied. This study intends to make classification on quality factors in ISO/TS 16949 by 
using Kano’s model, and thus find out factors for initiative improvement.  
 
2.3 Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process 
Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) integrates fuzzy theory with the aim of 
  7
fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Tseng and Lin(2008) discussed competitive advantage 
of implementing overall quality management by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process 
combined with sensitivity analysis. Therefore, this study plans to decide the importance 
of quality factors by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. 
  
2.4 Quality function deployment  
Quality function deployment is a systematic structure method of integrating 
thoughts of customers into the product development process, changing demands of 
customers into technology and service provided by enterprises as the standard to 
product establishment or service design, as well as deploying such design into each 
spare part or service program in a systematic way, and into relative relation between 
each factor in manufacture project or each factor in service project, so as to make 
products or service meet expectation and demand of customers (Akao, 1990). Bossert 
(1991) believes that quality function deployment can assist companies to understand 
customer demands, and make products or service meet expectation and demands of 
customers. Other than effectively integrating customer demands and product 
information (Buyukozkan and Feyzioglu, 2005), QFD is capable of correctly 
establishing quality standard regarding products or service design (Lowe ea al., 2000). 
QFD is a tool of crossing multiple functions that exchange market demand into the 
management decision process contained with variation (Wasserman, 1993). Quality 
house is a basic tool in quality function deployment, seen in figure 2. Quality house can 
exchange customer demands into technical demands, conforming to demands in final 
goal.

3.2 Sample objects and questionnaire design  
Firstly, surveyed objects are auditors and internal auditors with ISO/TS 16949 
inspection qualification, as well as consultants with years of experience in instruction. 
The questionnaire is designed into three parts, including measurement dimensions of 
quality factors, Kano’s model positive and negative questions and FAHP paired 
comparison questionnaire. Firstly, measurement dimensions of quality factors are 
designed on the basis of quality dimensions, integrated by Yusof and Aspinwall (1999), 
35 items regarding quality factors refer to the provision in articles in ISO/TS 16949, and 
variables developed by Saraph (1689) targeting quality management. Each dimension 
and its definition are seen in table 1.  
Secondly, a questionnaire with Kano positive and negative questions is designed by 
targeting such 35 items in quality factors of ISO/TS 16949, and designed under 
assumptions that quality factors are presented as well as quality factors are lacked. The 
questionnaires adopts Likert’s five-point scale, which respectively stands for 
satisfaction, must be, don’t care, acceptable and dissatisfaction from 1 to 5 score. 
Finally, according to the results in Kano’s model questionnaire, quality factors with 
preferable improvement will be listed into items in FAHP questionnaire. This study 
adopts paired comparison method to collect data; and respondents will compare the 
contents of two items in questionnaire. Filling method is measured by using nine-point

As to which quality factors to be preferably improved being discussed, this study 
regards the customer satisfaction coefficient defined by Marzler and Hinterhuber (1998) 
as the standard. Customer satisfaction coefficient refers to satisfaction increase by 
improving quality factors and more dissatisfaction reduction by improving quality 
factors. This study adopts satisfaction increment index (SII) and dissatisfaction 
decrement index (DDI) to find out quality factors with initial improvement. The 
calculation method is seen in formula (1) and (2):  
IMOA
OASII +++
+=
                                                  (1) 
IMOA
OADDI +++
+−= )(
                                            (2) 
 
In the above formulas, O represents one-dimension quality, A is abstractive quality, 
M is expected quality, and I is indifferent quality. Dissatisfaction reduction index 
multiplied by -1 is to highlight dissatisfaction feeling. Among which, as satisfaction 
increment index approaches 1, it means as quality factors are presented, and the 
satisfaction increment will be bigger. On the other hand, as dissatisfaction decrement 
index approaches -1, it means as quality factors are lacked, and it will cause bigger 
influence on dissatisfaction. This study obtains essential quality factors increasing 
satisfaction or reducing dissatisfaction as customer demands of QFD by summing up 
absolute values of SII and DDI.  
Next, after the satisfaction in Kano is calculated by using FAHP, quality factors 
with preferable improvement will be sequenced according to their importance. This 
study is based on theories developed by Buckly (1985) and replaces trapezoid fuzzy 
number by triangular fuzzy number, steps seen as follows:  
1. Problem description and hierarch framework establishment: Establish system 
framework to discuss the interaction among factors in each criteria in the 
  13
arithmetic mean method is seen as follows:  
   ( )nijijijij mmmNM ⊕⊕⊕⊗⎟⎠⎞⎜⎝⎛= ......1 21                              (7) 
     Among which  
     aijm : fuzzy appraisal toward sub-criteria j in major criteria i by experts. 
     ijM : fuzzy number after opinions of experts are integrated. 
7. Defuzzification: Defuzzification is used to exchange fuzzy number into 
understandable definite values. Formula acquired by using gravity method in this 
study is seen as follows. Geometric gravity of the calculated membership 
function of fuzzy number is regarded as definite value.   
    ( )ijijijij RMLA ,,~ =  is one triangular fuzzy function, and its defuzzification 
weight ijDF  is  
    ( ) ( )[ ] jiLLMLRDF ijijijijijij , , 3/ ∀+−+−=                   (8) 
 
8. Hierarchy series: Fuzzy weight in each hierarchy is multiplied by fuzzy weight in 
sub-criteria of each hierarchy, to acquire final fuzzy appraisal.  
9. Sequencing: Final scores in each criterion are sequenced to find quality factors in 
urgent need of improvement as essential quality factors.  
 
Finally, after two customer satisfaction coefficient values are summed up, quality 
factors with higher scores will be listed in left side of QFD as customer demands. Then, 
fuzzy weight acquired from FAHP is regarded as weight of customer demands. 6 kinds 
of technical demands will be listed in upper side of quality house by experienced 
auditors. Finally, technical demands to be preferably strengthened will be obtained after 
customer demands and relevant technical demands matrix being analyzed.  
 
4. Data analysis  
In the first phase of questionnaire survey, this study distributes a total of 83 pieces 
of Kano’s model questionnaire. After invalid questionnaires being cancelled, a total of 
effective 53 questionnaires were obtained. First, after questionnaire being conducted 
with reliability and validity analysis for verifying feasibility of the questionnaire, 
quality factors with preferable improvement were extracted after customer satisfaction 
coefficients in Kano’s model being counted. Then FAHP questionnaire was developed 
and distributed to 30 experts for completion. 7 invalid questionnaires were cancelled; 
and a total effective 23 questionnaires were obtained with a total recovery ratio of 
76.67%. Finally, essential quality factors and their weights were introduced into QFD to 
find out technical demands in urgent need of strengthening.

5. Conclusion and suggestion  
After the analysis being made above, two orientations with preferable 
improvement by enterprises are advocated by this study, which are given as suggestions 
about implementing ISO/TS 16949 certification. One is how to improve capability of 
collecting customer information to identify internal customers completing the 
requirements of products; and the other is how to identify production and service supply 
process to meet requirement by improving internal audit capability and statistical 
analysis capability. 
Customers were often emphasized in previous quality management literature; 
whereas the fact of customers containing internal customer and external customers is 
often neglected (Drake and Kossen, 1998). It is described in article 8.2.1 in ISO/TS 
16949 that an organization must monitor information data related to whether customers 
are satisfied toward the organization, and identify methods of acquiring and utilizing the 
information as one measurement method of operation efficiency of quality management 
system. Currently, the category of customer management is widespread. Other than 
external customers being customers, internal customers are separated into departments 
inside company, plants, and employee of the company. Survey on employee satisfaction 
can be realized through establishing models and questionnaires investigating employees 
with the following factors, such as working environment, salary and welfare, education 
training and employee cultivation, promotion management, and so on. Survey on
