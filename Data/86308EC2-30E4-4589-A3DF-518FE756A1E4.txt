Abstract 
Bromo-initiators for atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) were successfully immobilized on the surfaces 
of cross-linked poly(methyl methacrylate (PMMA) spheres by soap-free emulsion polymerization using CBr4 as 
the chain transfer agent. Subsequent surface-initiated ATRP (SI-ATRP) afforded a layer of PMMA brushes 
covalently attached to the sphere surfaces. Colloidal crystal films of these monodisperse spheres were then studied 
to identify the relationship between variation in particle diameter and the optical properties. The particle 
diameters were controlled by varying the feed monomer proportions in soap-free emulsion polymerization and the 
thickness of the grafted brush layer. It was found that the particle diameter could successfully be controlled to 
obtain crystal films that produce a variety of brilliant colors in the visible region. The results of this study can 
provide useful information for facile preparation of surface-immobilized ATRP initiators on colloidal polymers 
and employed for grafting polymer brushes.

Introduction 
Monodisperse colloids have long been used as advanced materials in various fields such as colloidal crystals, 
pigments, and bioassays.1–3 In the past few years, there has been much interest in colloidal crystal materials with 
three-dimensional periodic structures because of their ability to selectively control the propagation of 
electromagnetic waves in a particular frequency range.4 The crystal structure of the materials results in various 
brilliant colors in the visible region, as determined by the photonic bandgap of the crystal lattice and period.5 In 
addition, these materials have also found application in lasers, optical fibers, and quantum optical devices.6–8 
Throughout history, colloids have been successfully prepared by different synthesis methods: the Stöber 
method,9,10 emulsion polymerization,11 dispersion polymerization,12,13 soap-free emulsion polymerization,14–16 etc. 
Among these methods, soap-free emulsion polymerization is the simplest procedure for preparing monodisperse 
colloidal polymers, and this method can be used in the construction of colloidal crystals. In typical soap-free 
emulsion polymerization, synthesis parameters such as the kind of monomer, agitation rate, and temperature 
strongly determine the obtained particle diameter, coefficient of variation in particle size distribution (Cv), and 
polymerization rate. Zhang et al. proposed a rapid soap-free emulsion polymerization process, in which the 
monomers were polymerized at the boiling status of the solvent, for synthesizing monodisperse polymer spheres 
with various particle diameters to be used in colloidal crystals.16 Cui et al. have also successfully used 
monodisperse particles with various diameters to control the optical properties of the colloidal crystals.11 Precise 
control over particle diameter and low Cv, is thus critical to achieving accurate control over the optical properties 
of the obtained colloidal crystal. Therefore, soap-free emulsion polymerization is one method that promises a 
high degree of control. 
Surface functionalization of spherical particles is a widely used technique in both academia and industry.17–20 The 
synthesis of a polymer brushes-grafted sphere can be accomplished by the grafting-from method.21 This method is 
carried out in conjunction with surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP): linear chains are 
grown from the surfaces of the spherical particles to yield a covalently attached brush layer. SI-ATRP is an 
attractive polymer grafting method because it affords a narrow shell layer of well-defined polymer brushes with 
high grafting density. Most previous studies employed several synthetic steps to anchor the initiator groups 
necessary for SI-ATRP.22–25 Mizutani et al. reported the synthesis of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brush-grafted 
polystyrene beads by SI-ATRP.25 The ATRP initiator-immobilized polystyrene beads were prepared by two-step 
synthesis. The modification process can be simplified by the use of chain transfer agent during the particle growth 
period. A chain transfer agent is also employed in free radical polymerization to terminate chain growth.26 
Harrisson et al. reported evidence for halogen-capping of chain ends by CCl4 and CBr4 as chain transfer agents.27 
Therefore, the latter chain transfer agent was employed to attach halogen-capped chain end ATRP initiators to 
polymer particle surfaces. Subsequently, brushes can be grafted on by SI-ATRP. 
This paper describes the attachment of SI-ATRP initiators on colloidal polymers for the purpose of grafting 
brushes, as shown in Figure 1. On account of the grafting process was carried out in organic-solvent by SI-ATRP. 
Therefore, in order to ensure the colloidal polymers used had sufficient organic-solvent tolerance, cross-linked 
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) spheres (CPS) with different degrees of crosslinking, determined by the 
weight fraction of divinylbenzene (DVB) were subject to soap-free emulsion polymerization at the boiling 
 3
oxygen. Polymerization was then carried out at 60 °C under stirring (500 rpm) for 24 h. After polymerization, 
ion-exchange resin was added to the synthetic solution (to remove the copper ions) until the solution color turned 
from green to white. The obtained CPS with attached brushes (CPB) were rinsed with THF by repeated sequential 
centrifugation and then resuspended in THF. The monomer conversion was 7.26%, as determined by the 
gravimetric method. In addition, in order to obtain the molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 
the polymer brushes, the additional (sacrificial) ATRP initiator was added into the SI-ATRP system. 
Construction of Colloidal Crystals. Colloidal crystal films were made from CPS, CPI, and CPB. For this, 0.5 mL of 
latex of polymer spheres was dropped on glass substrates and then dried at 60 °C for 6 h. After evaporating, these 
polymer spheres were fabricated to ordered colloidal crystal films on glass substrate. 
Measurements. Each colloids were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, HITACHI, 
model S80, Japan) to determine the morphology. More than 200 particle diameters were picked from the FE-SEM 
photographs to determine the number-averaged diameter (dn), the standard deviation (), and the coefficient of 
variation in particle size distribution (Cv), defined as follows:28

Here ni is the number of particles with diameter (di). In addition, the hydrodynamic diameter (dh) was measured 
by dynamic light scattering (DLS, MALVERN, Zetasizer nano ZS, U.K.) for each colloids at 25 °C (633 nm laser, 
173o scattering angle). 
The surface chemical compositions of the colloids were characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical 
analysis (ESCA, Thermo VG Scientific, Sigma Probe, U.K.) with Al K source (1486.6 eV). Elemental surface 
stoichiometries were obtained from the sensitivity factor-corrected spectral area ratios. 
The molecular weight and polydispersity index were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, 
Viscotek, TDA 300, U.S.A.). The instrument consisted of a pump, three 300-mm mixed columns (Shodex, 
KF-805L, Japan), and a differential refractive-index detector in series. Data were collected and analyzed with 
Viscotek’s TriSEC gel permeation chromatography software package. The GPC system was operated at 40 °C 
with tetrahydrofuran as an eluent at 1 mL/min. A molecular weight calibration curve was obtained via 
polystyrene standards. 
The grafting density (, chains/nm2) was calculated according to the equation:29

Here W is the weight of polymer brushes, NA is the Avogadro’s number, Mn is the number-average molecular 
weight, and S is the surface area. The surface area was calculated from the dn to obtain a number of spheres and 
surface area of a sphere.  
Optical properties of the colloidal crystal films were evaluated by measuring reflection spectra to determine 
 5
maximum value of conversion (~80%) was achieved after 30 min. In order to immobilize bromo-initiators on CPS 
surfaces, the CBr4 was added at conversion nearly 70% (at 10 min). Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis 
(ESCA; Figure 6) showed composition of the CPS and CPI, respectively. The C 1s core-level spectra clearly 
showed that the immobilization of bromo-initiators on the CPI surfaces was verified by the appearance of the C-Br 
peak (286.4 eV). After surface atom calculated using survey spectral data, the attached amount of bromine atoms 
was 0.05% (Table 2). The ESCA results evidence of the presence of bromo-initiators on surfaces and proceeded 
with grafting of polymer brushes via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). 
The grafting process of PMMA brushes was carried out from the CPI surfaces by SI-ATRP. The ESCA result of the 
elemental surface stoichiometries were evaluated from the sensitivity factor-corrected spectral area ratios. As 
listed in Table 2, the O concentration of CPB was higher than that of CPI due to the addition of the homo-PMMA 
brushes grafted on CPI surfaces. After grafting process, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and 
polydispersity index of the PMMA brushes were 17200 and 1.38, respectively. The grafting density of the CPB 
could be calculated based on equation (4) which was 0.89 chains/nm2. In addition, the particle diameter 
characteristics of CPI and CPB are shown in Figure 7. From the FE-SEM photographs, the slight necking between 
the polymer spheres of CPB appeared due to the homo-PMMA brushes on surface. The average dn (n = 200) for 
CPI and CPB is shown in Table 2. This value of dn suggests that the thickness of the grafted brush layer was 7 nm. 
Furthermore, the dh increased from 206 nm to 322 nm in THF, which shows that the grafted PMMA brushes can 
greatly expand in THF. These results indicate that the monodisperse CPI could be successfully prepared and 
employed for grafting polymer brushes. 
Optical Properties of Colloidal Crystals. The monodisperse colloidal polymers were fabricated by evaporation 
method to form colloidal crystal films. The brilliant color of colloidal crystal films covering the visible regions 
could be controlled through the various particle diameters. Figure 8(a) shows color photographs of colloidal 
crystal films with various particle diameters. The CPS0, CPS15, and CPS35 films exhibited brilliant colors of red, 
green, and blue-green, respectively. Colloidal crystal films could exhibit brilliant color due to prevent the 
propagation of electromagnetic waves in a particular frequency range through the crystal structure in visible light 
region. Figure 8(b) shows the reflection spectra of the CPS0, CPS15, and CPS35 films at incident angles of 0º. As 
clearly seen in Figure 8(b), the reflection wavelengths in the visible region were controlled by varying particle 
diameter. Furthermore, the maximum reflected intensity decreased moving from CPS0 to CPS35 due to the 
influence of defects such as cracks, point defects, and dislocations (Figure 2). The measured wavelengths of 
maximum reflected intensity (max) are listed in Table 3. In addition, the theoretical wavelength (cal) of the 
colloidal crystal films could be estimated from the modified Bragg’s law, which describes the bandgap position of 
a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. As shown in Table 3, the peak reflected intensity wavelength (max) was 
greater than the value predicted form modified Bragg’s law (cal) because of an increase in the distance between 
colloidal crystals for FCC lattice with close-packed structure (Figure 2 and Figure 7). Nevertheless, agreement is 
good, which suggests that Bragg’s law is practical for the colloidal crystals. From modified Bragg’s law for the 
FCC structure, two parameters (the particle diameter and incidence angle) determine max. Therefore, the varying 
incident angles of CPS0 colloidal crystal film were evaluated as shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 9, max 
for incidence at 20°, 40°, 50°, and 60° on the CPS0 film was 635 nm (red region), 584 nm (yellow region), 555 
nm (green region), and 519 nm (green region). Clearly, max exhibited significant blue-shift with an increase in

This study investigates the preparation of luminescence of hollow silica microspheres by using 
monodisperse polystyrene spheres as template. The monodisperse polystyrene spheres were 
prepared by dispersion polymerization. Subsequently, the luminescence of silica material was   
synthesized on polystyrene sphere surface by Stöber method to form a core/shell structure. After 
calcination of the core/shell microsphere, the luminescence of uniform-size hollow silica 
microspheres could be obtained. The luminescence of uniform-size hollow silica microspheres were 
characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and fluorescence spectrometer. As results, 
the shell layer (luminescence of silica material) was ~80 nm. The brilliant color could be varied 
throughout the emission spectra by the luminescence of silica material with various 3-aminopropyl 
triethoxysilane (APTEOS) amounts. Consequently, this study provides useful information for 
preparation of luminescence of uniform-size hollow silica microspheres and their potential 
applications in various fields.
