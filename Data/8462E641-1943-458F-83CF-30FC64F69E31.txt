1. Introduction  
 
The objective of the proposed research is to establish a multidisciplinary research infrastructure using 
the high-throughput screening technique (combinatorial approach) for systematically exploring novel 
electronic metal-oxide thin film dielectrics, with high dielectric constant () and reasonably low leakage 
current density (JL), applied in the field of advanced gate stacks.  
 
Based on this, amorphous Y2O3-TiO2/SiO2 higher- gate dielectric layers were targeted. We have 
obtained some good results, which were wrapped into a manuscript. It has been accepted by the IEEE 
Transactions on Electron Devices and will be published in the next available issue of IEEE T-ED. 
 
Here summarize some key features. A full paper is attached. 
 
 
2. Experimental procedures 
 
A pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system, equipped with a multiple target carousel and an indexed rotating 
substrate holder/heater, was used to deposit the Y2O3-TiO2 library films. Target ablation is synchronized with 
the rotation of a substrate. By adjusting overlap of the two sub-monolayers, a uniform natural Y2O3-TiO2 
composition spread can be obtained. The library films were deposited on 75 mm (100) p-type silicon wafers, 
heated to a temperature of 400 ºC. All films were subjected to a 500 °C/2 hr + 400 °C/1 hr forming gas (90% 
N2 and 10% H2) anneal to minimize interface state density (Dit). To fashion capacitors for local measurement 
of the electrical properties, a 50 nm molybdenum (Mo) electrode film was deposited through a stainless steel 
shadow mask that had a 25 x 25 array of 250 m diameter openings.  
 
High throughput spectroscopic reflectometry was used to measure the thicknesses of the library films. A 
scanning X-ray diffractometer was used to characterize the phase structure as a function of composition. A 
semiautomatic probe station was programmed to measure the array of 625 capacitors. An 
inductance-capacitance-resistance (LCR) meter was used to measure capacitance-voltage (C-V) 
characteristics. The measured C-V curves were fitted using a standard program to extract the accumulation 
capacitance and the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT). 
 
3. Results 
 
The characteristic near infrared spectra of Y2O3 and TiO2 films were measured by optical reflectometry 
and fitted by a bimodal cosn function to obtain a thickness distribution. A wide atomic composition range, i.e., 
TiO2 ranging from 28% to 94%, is obtained.

Abstract— In this study, it is reported an approach using native 
SiO2 to make amorphous higher dielectric constant films based on 
the Y2O3-TiO2/SiO2/Si compositional spread libraries by a 
combinatorial pulsed laser deposition. The key feature of the 
experiment is that combinatorial methodology is used to quickly 
screen the potential high dielectric constant films out of a large 
composition parameter space. Scanning X-ray 
microdiffractometry and high resolution transmission electron 
microscopy results show TiO2-rich is amorphous after 500 C 
anneal. A wide composition range near TiO2-rich, exhibiting 
amorphous, dielectric constants of 30 to 50, and reasonably low JL 
(< 10-5 A/cm2), may be of great interest for a gate-last process flow 
for the advanced gate stacks.

I. INTRODUCTION 
GGRESIVE scaling of complementary-metal-oxide- 
semiconductor (CMOS) transistors has resulted in SiO2 
gate dielectric layers so thin (≈ 1 nm) that they are no longer 
effective dielectrics, giving rise to high leakage current 
densities (JL) [1, 2]. Thus, much recent research has focused on 
efforts to identify new dielectric materials, having dielectric 
constants () higher than SiO2 to replace it in advanced gate 
stacks [3-8]. To meet the demands of the Si microelectronics 
industry, the following criteria must be considered: 1) the gate 
dielectric should ideally be amorphous to prevent electrical and 
mass transport along grain boundaries, 2) it should have a high 
 so that a gate capacitance equivalent to that of an SiO2 film 
may be achieved in a physically thicker film, 3) its band offset 
with Si should be high enough (> 1 eV) to avoid Schottky 
emission, and 4) it should be thermodynamically stable in 
contact with Si to prevent interfacial reactions that would 
degrade device performance [8]. HfO2-based or related 
dielectrics have been leading candidates to replace SiO2 due to 
their high  (≈ 20) as compared to SiO2 ( = 3.9) [9-15]; Intel 
has incorporated HfO2 in 45 nm transistors [16]. However, for 
continued scaling applications [3], research pushes for higher- 
(25 to 100) dielectrics.

Washington, Seattle, WA 98185 USA.  
The literature suggests that it would be difficult to find a 
simple dielectric possessing all of the required characteristics. 
For example, TiO2 has a higher  (80 to 110), but it is not 
thermo-dynamically stable on Si [8], and exhibits a small 
conduction band offset with Si (≈ 0.3 eV) due to its small band 
gap (≈ 3.5 eV), and therefore high JL [17]. Y2O3, on the other 
hand, is thermodynamically stable on Si, and has a larger band 
gap (≈ 5.6 eV) and a large conduction band offset with silicon 
(≈ 2.3 eV). However, its dielectric constant (17 to 20) is 
relatively low [8, 18]. In addition, both TiO2 and Y2O3 are easy 
to crystalize at temperature higher than 300 C [19-21], which 
prevents them to meet the criteria for the advanced higher-k 
applications.  
The goal of this research is to explore an efficient route to 
rapidly screen amorphous higher- layers with reasonably low 
JL by taking advantage of the native SiO2, which is widely 
known to possess a capability to sustain amorphous of many 
metal oxides [8]. We addressed this issue by applying 
combinatorial methodologies [22, 23] to produce a wide range 
of compositions of Y2O3-TiO2 based “library films” on the 
SiO2/Si substrates.   
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
A pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system [24], equipped with 
a multiple target carousel and an indexed rotating substrate 
holder/heater, was used to deposit the library films. Target 
ablation is synchronized with the rotation of a substrate; a 
sub-monolayer amount of TiO2 was deposited first, indexing 
the substrate to 0º, followed by the deposition of a 
sub-monolayer amount of Y2O3, after indexing the substrate to 
180º. This cycle was repeated multiple times until the desired 
library thicknesses, 12 nm (20 cycles), 30 nm (50 cycles), and 
90 nm (150 cycles), were obtained. The 90 nm sample was only 
used to determine the compositions of the Y2O3-TiO2 library, 
which will be discussed in Fig. 1. By adjusting overlap of the 
two sub-monolayers, a uniform natural Y2O3-TiO2 composition 
spread can be obtained. To maintain the same atomic flux ratios 
for Ti and Y, a cycle of 38 laser pulses for TiO2 followed by 59 
pulses for Y2O3 was used; the number of laser pulses was 
determined by calibrating the deposition rates from the two 
targets separately [25]. The library films were deposited on 75 
mm (100) p-type silicon wafers, heated to a temperature of 400 
ºC. During PLD, the oxygen pressure was maintained at 0.67 Pa. 
A KrF excimer laser (248 nm) was focused to a fluence of ≈ 15 
J/cm2 on the targets. The distance between the target and the 
substrate was 6.5 cm. All films were subjected to a 500 °C/2 hr 
+ 400 °C/1 hr forming gas (90% N2 and 10% H2) anneal to

二、與會心得 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the National Science Council (NSC) to financially 
support my trip to this meaningful conference.  
I have learned a lot from attending this conference, including networking within the international 
community of other young researchers, and increasing the breadth of my general/specific materials-based 
knowledge. Also I have gained opportunities to seek the insight and advice of successful senior 
researchers through plenary sessions and instructive seminars.

Abstract 
 
Combinatorial synthesis is an emerging methodology since there is an increasing need for a more 
efficient approach to accelerate the discovery of new materials. The combinatorial approach allows the 
making of hundreds of different samples and enabling the generation of comprehensive and consistent 
data sets, which significantly enhances the systematical study of the change in different physical 
properties of materials.
