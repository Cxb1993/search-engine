INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Research Background 
A wide range of cost forecasting techniques has been exploited in the 
construction industry. Research on uncertainty in construction has emphasized 
the importance of incorporating uncertainty factors in project cost forecasts. 
Such forecasts are necessary for the project manager to determine if corrective 
actions are required to minimize the expected variances from planned 
performance.  
Construction cost overrun is a common problem in the construction industry. 
It is believed that construction projects experience an increase in cost of about 
33% on average (Hartley and Okamoto 1997). In the project domain, most 
studies have focused on developing methodologies that incorporate the effects of 
uncertainty on project cost overruns. Most cost systems often underestimate cost 
overruns until late in the life of a project when there is little that can be done to 
control the situation. Since one of the most important requirements of a cost 
system is to give early warning of cost overruns, this is a significant failure 
(Teicholz 1993).  
Many factors are necessary to consider in forecasting cost overruns. Factors 
such as weather, productivity, material, equipment and management quality are 
identified escalating cost for the construction projects. These factors will affect

To make this research more clearly, the boundary of this research is 
specified below: 
1. This research presents a way to obtain cost overrun probability using Poisson 
process and particle filter algorithm. Amount of actual dollar value overrun is 
not forecasted in this research. 
2. This research only attempts to give early warning of cost overruns in the 
construction stage and to determine if corrective actions are required or not. 
What kind of corrective action that taken is not presented in this research. 
3. Some factors that affecting cost escalating are considered, including weather, 
productivity, material delivery, etc.

CHAPTER 2  
LITERATURE STUDY AND REVIEWS 
 
In this chapter, the comparison to the amount of research that has been done 
on project cost overrun is described. At first, this research attempt to understand 
to the main idea of project cost overrun. Section 2.1 shows some researches on 
project performance and earn value management (EVM). Some cost 
contingency researches that have been proposed are described in section 2.2. 
Section 2.3 describes some researches proposed kind of factors that affect the 
project costs and durations. Finally, section 2.4 shows study on stochastic 
process applied in construction project. 
  
2.1 Project Performance and Earn Value Management (EVM) 
When controlling project performance, it is important to not only monitor 
cost and time variances for actual project progress, but also to properly establish 
the actual project status based on objective predictions (forecasts) of final 
project performance. At completion project performance can be predicted by 
comparing estimates of planned total budget and final duration with their 
respective most likely forecasted values (Ahuja et al. 1994).  
Earned value project management is a well-known management system that 
integrates cost, schedule and technical performance. It allows the calculation of 
 8 
¾ Vandevoorde and Vanhoucke (2005) compared the classic earned value 
performance indicators SV and SPI with the newly developed earned 
schedule performance indicators SV(t) and SPI(t). They also presented a 
generic schedule forecasting formula applicable in different project 
situations and compare the three methods from literature to forecast total 
project duration.  
The different schedule forecasting methods will be applied to real 
project data for three projects. Each project has a different performance, one 
project is behind schedule but under cost, one project is late with a cost 
over-run and one project is ahead of schedule but with a cost over-run. 
The results show a similar forecasting accuracy for each method in the 
linear planned value case. However, the introduction of learning curves, 
which is much more realistic in the project world, results in a different 
forecasting accuracy for the three methods. The three real-life projects 
reveal that the earned schedule method was the only method which showed 
satisfying and reliable results during the whole project duration. 
Consequently, the results confirm the previously found results that the 
results obtained by the planned value rate and the earned duration method 
are unreliable at the end of the project. Instead, the earned schedule method 
seems to provide valid and reliable results along the project’s lifespan.

uncertainty in large multiyear construction projects. The system uses a 
Monte Carlo simulation approach and considers variability of project 
component durations and uncertainty of escalation factor during the project 
lifetime and calculated the distribution for cost. 
¾ Baccarini (2006) provide a review of literature pertaining to the estimating 
of project cost contingency. It describes the flaws of the tradition percentage 
method for estimating project cost contingency and sets out more robust 
estimation methods – regression analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and 
artificial neural networks.  
 
2.3 Factors Affecting Cost and Duration of Construction Projects 
Many of the factors that affect cost and duration of construction projects 
have been identified and studied. In this section, some researches about factors 
affecting cost and duration of construction projects are described. Following are 
the brief introduction of those researches. 
¾ Okpala and Aniekwu (1988) investigated causes of high costs of 
construction in Nigeria. The study revealed 27 factors contributing to high 
costs and delays in completion time. A questionnaire survey was conducted 
which included engineers, architects and quantity surveyors. The rankings 
of the influencing variables by the three professions were found to be fairly 
similar, despite some differences in their views. The professionals generally 
agreed that shortage of materials, methods of financing and payments for 
 12 
sources that affect the contractor’s risk of cost overburden. Source of these 
risks relate to factors affecting the cost estimate and the final cost of a 
project include factors specific to the cost estimator, the project design, 
construction and the project environment. Construction-specific factors 
include unknown geological condition, weather conditions, and client and 
subcontractor-generated risk factors. 
¾ Dissanayaka and Kumaraswamy (1999) evaluated the relative influences of 
critical procurement and non-procurement related factors on cost 
performance in a sample of Hong Kong based building projects. Using 
multiple linear regression, they found that cost overruns are influenced by 
levels of client confidence in the construction team, risk retained by client 
for quantity variations, levels of construction complexity related new 
technology and payment modality. These factors were then used to develop 
artificial neural network models for predicting cost indices. 
¾ Chan et al (2004) developed a conceptual framework on critical success 
factors (CSFs). Five major groups of independent variables, namely 
project-related factors, project procedures, project management actions, 
human related factors, and external environment are identified as crucial to 
project success. 
¾ Elhag et al. (2005) assessed and ranked cost-influencing factors of 
construction projects at the pre-tender stage for building projects in the UK. 
Sixty-seven factors were selected. They were grouped into six different

CHAPTER 3 
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 
In order to achieve the objective of this research, some approaches and 
practices are required. Poisson process and Particle Filter are the main 
approaches of this research. Poisson process is used to model the occurrence of 
cost overrun events and particle filter algorithm is used to sampling the 
uncertain parameters which requires the incorporation of the observation data. 
Some stochastic simulation systems include Sampling-Importance Resampling 
(SIR), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Particle Filter is as follow. 
3.1 Stochastic Simulation Techniques for Cost Overrun Forecasting 
Traditional percentage is the most commonly used estimating method in 
cost overrun forecasting (Baccarini, 2006). However, three estimating methods 
have gained prominence in recent times: stochastic simulation techniques, 
regression analysis and artificial neural networks. Because the approaches used 
in this research are the stochastic simulation systems, the traditional percentage, 
regression analysis and artificial neural networks method will not described in 
this research.  
In this section, some stochastic simulation techniques are described 
including Sampling-Importance Resampling (SIR), Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) and Particle Filter. Figure 3.1 shows the history of stochastic

Importance sampling is inefficient when X dimension is high. This is 
because when the dimension is high, the importance weights may become highly 
non-uniform. The consequence is that the number of effective samples is little. 
3.1.2 Modified Importance Sampling (MIS) 
For Bayesian analysis, we usually only know how to evaluate the posterior 
PDF ( )Yxf ˆ  up to a constant:

3.1.3 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a class of algorithms for 
sampling from probability distributions based on constructing a Markov chain 
that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution. The state of the 
chain after a large number of steps is then used as a sample from the desired 
distribution. The quality of the sample improves as a function of the number of 
steps. 
3.1.4 Particle Filters 
In recent years, particle filters have found widespread applications in 
domain with noisy sensor, such as computer vision and robotic. Particle filterz 
are powerful tools for Bayesian state estimation in non-linear systems. The key 
idea of particle filters is to approximate a posterior distribution over unknown 
state variables by a set of particles drawn from this distribution. 
Particle filters, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMC), are 
sophisticated model estimation techniques based on simulation. They are usually 
used to estimate Bayesian models and are sequential analogue of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and are often similar to importance sampling 
method. If well designed, particle filters can be much faster than MCMC.

4.3 Poisson Cost Overrun Model 
Let us further assume the cost overrun event is subjected to random events 
modeled by a Poisson process. This assumption is based on the previous 
research study by Touran (2003) that also assume cost overrun event is modeled 
by a Poisson process. Let us denote μ equal to mean rate of occurrence per unit 
time, and each rate of occurrence brings in cost overrun amount equal to λ. In 
most cases, the λ and μ parameters are unknown.

Corrective Action Model 
The equations presented so far do not consider corrective actions. If the cost 
is overrun at time instant m and the corrective action is taken place at that time, 
Xm will be deterministic and equal to 0, i,e it is assumed that the project cost 
returns to the planning cost . If the corrective action is taken place at time instant 
m, λXm will be set equal to real number [ ]1,0∈ν , or equivalently Xm will be reset 
to λν / . That is, it is assumed that when the corrective is taken the project cost 
does not return to the planning cost. The parameter ν also unknown since the 
impact of the corrective action is uncertain. 
Observation Model 
It is assumed that at certain time instant i, an observation is taken to 
determine if the cost is overrun or not, i.e. to determine if λXk is greater than 1. 
However the observation is assumed to be noisy. Given λ and Xi = xi, and the 
probability that the cost will be overrun is

CHAPTER 5 
CASE STUDY  
 
  Based on the model construction and simulated example in chapter four, 
we can use the factors that affecting cost escalating from the observation result 
such as weather, productivity, etc to estimate the cost overrun probability and 
cost overrun rate of the project. But in the real condition, many factors are 
necessary to consider in forecasting cost overruns. We need to combine all the 
factors and use sensitivity analysis in order to know which factor has the most 
influence on project cost overrun.  
In this chapter, the application of the proposed model in the real project is 
demonstrated to validate the accuracy of the particle filter algorithm through the 
comparison with earn value management (EVM) method. Two projects of SRC 
building in Taiwan are taken to demonstrate the use of the proposed method.  
Moreover, this chapter describes the concept to combine many factors and 
sensitivity analysis in order to know most influence factor.

5.1.2 Simulation Result 
First project: Muzha 
For the first project, it is assumed that the factors are independent to each 
other because of the complexity of the project. With this assumption, the prior 
PDF of the parameter μ  is assumed to be uniformly distributed over [0.001, 
0.01], [0.001, 0.1], [0.001, 0.1], [0.001, 0.1], [0.001, 0.1] for weather, 
productivity, material, equipment and management, respectively. This 
assumption is based on the information, how many times each factor affecting 
cost overrun in one month. Since there is not much prior information about the

the above equations, the cost overrun probability from EVM can be estimated.  
Table 5.8 shows the comparison between EVM value, PF value and real 
value. The shaded area is the values that match the real value. The accuracy 
from each method is estimated with equation (5.3).

The estimation of percentage accuracy is described in Table 5.9. The 
percentage accuracy of EVM and PF compare to the real value is 82.5 % and 
100 %, respectively. From this result, we can see that the particle filter value is 
more accurate than EVM value compare with the real value.

CHAPTER 6 
CONCLUSION AND FURTHER RESEARCH DIRECTION 
 
The primary purpose of this research is to forecast the cost overrun 
probability based on the factors that affecting cost escalating such as weather, 
productivity, etc. In order to achieve this purpose, the application of the 
proposed model in the real project is presented in previous chapter to determine 
the cost overrun probability, cost overrun rate and most influence factor to cost 
overrun. In this chapter, the conclusions and contribution of this research are 
presented. Moreover, recommendations to future research direction are also 
addressed.  
 
6.1 Conclusion 
The use of particle filter to forecast the cost overrun probability yields a 
more realistic model. It enables the assessment of the cost overrun probability to 
be made based on the factors that affecting cost escalating. The output of the 
model is presented numerically, providing the early warning of cost overruns to 
the project manager of the project.  
From the simulation result described in previous chapter, the conclusions of 
this research are described as follow: 
1. The particle filter result is more reliable than from EVM although at some 
 56 
overrun. 
3. Further research should examine factors that affecting cost escalating in 
more details not only factors described in this research.
