in order. The Gray code is a method of encoding binary
numbers which has the property that two consecutive
numbers differ only in one bit. Based on the Gray
code representation, each sensor can effortlessly real-
ize whether a packet comes from one of its adjacent
directions or not.
Most previous works mentioned the benefit of
location-known sensors placement in localization [13],
[14]. DLS, thus, deploys a small fraction of direction-
aware sensors, called anchors, via either digital com-
passes or manual presetting. That is, each anchor is
aware of its direction. The numbers of anchors re-
quired in DLS is the same as the number of directions
(namely, Ndir). All anchors are evenly placed at the
range r from the sink on each axis (i.e., there exists
only one anchor on each axis).
The communication ranges of the sink, anchors, and
unknown sensors are assumed to be identical. DLS
exploits the radio propagation model in [30], by which
the receiver is able to measure the signal strength
in spite of attenuation of radio signal. The perfect
spherical radio propagation is also assumed.
Definition 1: Given two sensors si and sj , sj is
said to be the neighbor of si if sj is within si’s
communication range, and vice versa. 2
Recall that we use the Gray code representation to
stand for the direction code. The code assignment of
the anchor follows the counterclockwise manner, by
which anchor ai+1 is regarded as in the counterclock-
wise direction of anchor ai. In Figure 1, four anchors
(namely, a1, a2, a3, and a4), whose primary direc-
tion codes cpri(a1), cpri(a2), cpri(a3), and cpri(a4)
are respectively indexed by 00, 01, 11, and 10, are
placed on each axis. The anchors associated with axes
virtually partition the network into 8 regions, termed
Ri and Ai, for i = 1, 2, ..., 4. The sub-regions of axis
region Ai are denoted as A
(1)
i and A
(2)
i . Actually, the
primary direction code of each directional region is
assigned by the sink. Suppose the direction code of
Ri and Ai are respectively denoted by cpri(Ri) and
cpri(Ai). As Figure 1 shows, the primary direction
codes of four directional regions, cpri(R1), cpri(R2),
cpri(R3), and cpri(R4), are regarded as 00, 01, 11, and
10, respectively. The direction codes of axis regions
A1, A2, A3, and A4 are regarded as 00, 01, 11, and
10, respectively. All sensors in a certain directional or
axis region have the same primary direction code. For
example, all sensors within R1, A
(1)
1 , and A
(2)
1 share
direction code 00.
III. SPATIAL LOCALITY PROPERTY
As mentioned before, packet dissemination enables
a sensor to determine its direction by means of the
information in the received LREQ packet(s). Namely,
the estimate for a sensor is obviously associated with

Fig. 1. Example of the network model with Ndir = 4. Without
loss of generality, the sink is placed at the center. Four anchors
(i.e., a1, a2, a3, and a4) are deployed at the range r to the sink
on each axis. The network is virtually partitioned into 8 regions: 4
directional regions (i.e., R1, R2, R3, and R4) and 4 axis regions
(i.e., A1, A2, A3, and A4). Each axis region is divided into two
sub-regions. Namely, axis region Ai includes sub-regions A

the direction of its neighbors. Thus, we made nu-
merous prior investigations to observe the impacts
of the packets received at a sensor. Figure 2 shows
the result in terms of different numbers of sensors
and communication ranges. For ease of explanation,
the directions where LREQ packets come from are
categorized as the same, adjacent, and other, which
are listed as below.
• Same: Given a sensor si with direction code
cpri(si), if a sensor sj is si’s neighbor and
cpri(si) = cpri(sj), then for sensor si the packet
sent from sj is indicated by the same.
• Adjacent: Given a sensor si with direction code
cpri(si), if a sensor sj is si’s neighbor, and the
difference between cpri(si) and cpri(sj) is only
in one bit, then for sensor si the packet from sj
is indicated by the adjacent.
• Other: For a sensor si, the packet from neither the
same nor the adjacent is denoted by the other.
Consider a network with Ndir = 4, for a sensor
with direction code 00, a packet from direction 00
is indicated by the same, while a packet from either
direction 01 or 10 is viewed as the adjacent. A packet
originated from the direction other than 00, 01, and 10
is represented by the other. The observation in Figure 2
reveals that for a sensor, approximately 88.8% packets
received come from the sensor(s) in the same direction.
The percentages of packets from either the adjacent or
other region reach about 5.1% or 6.1%, respectively.
In general, a sensor close to the axis most probably
receives packets from the sensors in the same or
the adjacent direction. Besides, a sensor within the

range of anchor a8. Significantly, a1 and a2 are the
two closest anchors to the sensor. We consequently
give Rule 1 for code assignment of the critical sensor.
Rule 1: Suppose ai and aj are the two closest
anchors to the critical sensor si. The direction code
of critical sensor si is defined as cpri(ai) if cpri(ai)
is precedent to cpri(aj) in the Gray code sequence.
Obviously, a sensor within either CR1 or CR2 has
the accurate direction code 000. All critical sensors in
other directions are also aware of the correct direction
codes in accordance with Rule 1. Recall that accu-
rate estimation of critical sensors significantly assists
unknown sensors in direction estimations because the
LREQ packet is initiated from the sink. As a result,
DLS exploits an elegant anchor deployment strategy,
which locates all anchors evenly at the communication
ranges from the sink on each axis, to reduce the prop-
agation errors in the course of packet dissemination.
B. Multi-message Decision Scheme
As mentioned before, one-message decision scheme
only relies on one LREQ packet for sensor direction
learning. The localization protocol based on such
scheme is straightforward and cost-effective, as well as
easy to implement. However, the technique obviously
incurs erroneous estimates if a sensor only receives one
LREQ packet which comes from the other direction.
Inspired by the spatial locality property, a novel multi-
message decision scheme is utilized in DLS. The main
idea of the scheme is taking a reasonable duration
into account to consider more LREQ packets for the
improvement of the accuracy in direction estimating.
Figure 4 illustrates the transitions among the states.
Each sensor maintains the information of the neighbors
in its own neighboring table. All sensors are initially
in the Idle states. A sensor in the Waiting and the
Learning states is to gather more LREQ packets and to
determine its direction according to the received LREQ
packets, respectively. In the Sending state, a sensor

immediately sends an LREQ packet to propagate the
current estimate to all of its neighbors, and then enters
the Idle state.
C. Virtual Dual Direction Coordinate (VDDC) System
The spatial locality property implies that for a sensor
most of the received LREQ packets come from its
neighbors in the same direction. Although the anchor
deployment strategy guarantees accurate estimates for
all critical sensors, erroneous estimates are likely to
occur during packet dissemination. The circumstance
is significantly revealed in the axis region.
As Figure 5 shows, the shaded regions are the axis
regions. Each direction has two axis sub-regions. In
spite of the utilization of the multi-message decision
scheme, a sensor within the axis region may signifi-
cantly obtain the erroneous estimate. Specially, the di-
rection code of such sensor is probably identical to the
one of the adjacent direction. For example, a sensor, si,
actually locates within A(2)1 (i.e., cpri(si) = 00), but
may be regarded as locating in R4 (i.e., cpri(si) = 10)
if most of LREQ packets received come from direc-
tion 10. Such incorrect estimation obviously incurs
less performance in sensor localization. To efficiently
improve the DLS of estimated correctness in direction
of the sensor within the axis region, DLS considers an
auxiliary coordinate system, VADC, associated with
the VPDC system. The VADC system is generated by
counterclockwise rotating the VPDC system with an
angle α = piNdir . The approach to code assignment in
the VADC system resembles that in the VPDC one.
As shown in Figure 6, a system, involving the
VPDC and VADC systems, is named the Virtual Dual
Direction Coordinate (VDDC) system. The dark and
gray broken lines respectively indicate the VPDC and
VADC systems. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the VADC
systems for Ndir = 4 and 8, respectively. Figure 5
demonstrates an example of the coding system ex-
ploited in DLS. For ease of description, each direction
is assumed to comprise 4 sub-regions. Two of the
sub-regions are directional sub-regions, and the other
two ones are axis sub-regions. All sensors hold two
direction codes at the end of direction estimation.
The main goal of the VADC system is to enable a

with the random and greedy methods with respect
to different numbers of sensors and communication
ranges. Besides, the scenario, where the sink is placed
at the edge of the network, is also evaluated.
1) Effects of Anchor Deployment Strategy: Here,
we devise two methods, random and greedy methods,
to evaluate the impacts of different anchor deploy-
ments on sensor localization. The numbers of anchors
in both approaches are identical and equal to Ndir.
For ease of representation, the random and greedy
methods, here, are respectively indicated by RLS and
GLS. In RLS, all anchors are randomly deployed
within the whole network, whereas in GLS, whose
main idea is to improve the estimated correctness of
the critical sensors, anchors are evenly distributed in
each direction within the critical regions. Additionally,
both of which also use the multi-message decision
strategies for direction estimation.
Figure 7 shows the estimated correctness for differ-
ent anchor deployment strategies. Obviously, GLS out-
performs RLS regardless of the number of directions.
Due to random deployment of anchors, the average
correct rates of RLS to 4, 8, and 16 directions are
approximately 30.13%, 35.52%, and 39.82%, respec-
tively. The correct rate actually improves with the
increase of Ndir because of the existence of more
anchors.
In GLS, the average estimated correctness in terms
of 4, 8, and 16 directions reach 64.96%, 58.93%, and
43.00%, respectively. Since GLS exploits the strategy,
which places all anchors within the critical region,
in sensor localization, more critical sensors enable to
obtain the more accurate estimations. Based on the
packet propagation, the unknown sensors will learn the
high level of accuracy in direction by means of packet
propagation. However, the result shows that more
directions in GLS obviously incur the disappointing
performance. Because all anchors are randomly placed
within the critical region of each direction, a critical
sensor within multiple anchors’ communication ranges
has a high chance to receive the LREQ packets from
the anchors with different direction codes. Therefore,
a sensor may consequently obtain the erroneous direc-
tion.
To consider the tradeoff between the number of
anchors and the locations of anchors, DLS places all
anchors at the communication range from the sink on
each axis. Figure 7 reveals that DLS achieves approx-
imate 94.33%, 86.06%, and 81.09% in correct rates
for 4, 8, and 16 directions, respectively. Such anchor
deployment technique guarantees a critical sensor not
only receives the LREQ packets transmitted from the
limited anchors, but also avoids much communica-
tion and computation overhead. Therefore, a sensor
does not suffer from the interference resulted from
the LREQ packets from other directions, and quickly
achieves the direction estimation.
2) Comparison of Different Localization Schemes:
Figure 8 shows an example result of spatial sensor
distribution, in which the circle and cross respectively
represent the sensors with the accurate and erroneous
estimates. The network with Ndir = 4 consists of 500
sensors, and the communication range of each sensor
is 80m. In this case, totally 438 sensors are identified
the accurate directions. Namely, DLS achieves an
estimated correctness of approximately 88%. Signif-
icantly, incorrect estimated sensors always appear in
the vicinity of the axis region due to the receipt of
numerous packets from other directions.

Fig. 8. Example of spatial sensor distribution for 500 sensors
scattered in the network with Ndir = 4. The blue and red sensors
respectively represent the sensors with accurate and erroneous
estimates.
Figures 9 and 10 respectively show the simulation
results of the estimated correctness in terms of dif-
ferent numbers of sensors and communication ranges
for RLS, GLS and DLS. Among these localization
schemes, the performance of DLS is obviously better
than those of both GLS and RLS in case of the
6
variation for different numbers of sensors because of
the invalidation of the multi-message decision scheme.
In Figure 10, for DLS, the increase of communica-
tion range results in the larger critical region. Thus, the
number of critical sensors, whose directions are always
accurate also increases. Such critical sensors further
lead to the accurate estimate of the unknown sen-
sor within the non-critical region, and, consequently,
improve the performance of sensor localization. Ad-
ditionally, large communication range increases the
number of neighbors of a sensor. Therefore, a sensor
receives more LREQ packets, and then obtains the
accurate direction by means of the multi-message
decision scheme. With the characteristic of random
anchor deployment, RLS causes slight variation in
Cdual for distinct communication ranges. In GLS, with
the increase of the communication range, the number
of unknown sensors within the critical region may
increase owing to more LREQ packets coming from
different directions. Such LREQ packets eventually
degrade the correct rates of unknown sensors within
the critical region. Furthermore, the increase of sensors
with erroneous directions may result in the disappoint-
ing performance of localization because such incorrect
direction information will be propagated via LREQ
packets.
Figure 12 demonstrates the effectiveness of DLS
in diverse high density networks. The results are
generated by averaging the estimated correctness for
various communication ranges in the corresponding
number of sensors. Obviously, DLS reaches approx-
imately 96.51%, 90.27%, and 85.59% in accuracy for
Ndir=4, 8, and 16, respectively. The correct rates for
Ndir = 4, 8, and 16 all keep rising with large number
of sensors because the multi-message decision scheme
works significantly. Note that the curves for Ndir=4,
8, and 16 rise gently after 1000 sensors. We reason
that more sensors within the axis regions are likely to
deteriorate the correct rate. Overall, the multi-message
decision scheme is able to tolerate the estimated errors
in spite of large number of sensors within the axis
regions. Consequently, DLS can achieve well level of
accuracy, especially for high dense WSNs.
3) Effects of the VADC system: As mentioned be-
fore, the VADC system is mainly to improve the
estimated correctness of the sensor within the axis
region. Numerous non-critical applications, such as
environmental monitoring can tolerate the inaccuracy
in geographic information. Thus, Cdual is obviously
unsuitable for such applications to evaluate the esti-
mated correctness. Here, we devise the metrics, Cpri,
revised from Cdual to evaluate the effect of the VADC
system in sensor localization. Compared to Cdual, Cpri
does not consider the effect of NA because NA is
related to the VADC system. The Cpri is defined as

where Ns is the number of sensors in the network.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the VADC sys-
tem, we make the simulations about the improvement
of the VADC system in terms of different numbers
of sensors and communication ranges, respectively. In
Figures 13 and 14, DLS-VADC means the approach,
excluding the VADC system from DLS. Overall, DLS-
VADC reaches 82.74%, 67.83%, and 57.05% in the es-
timated correctness for Ndir=4, 8, and 16, respectively.
As shown in Figures 13 and 14, the improvement in
estimated correctness becomes remarkable with the
increase of Ndir. The VADC system significantly
leads to the improvement in the estimated correctness
for Ndir = 4 about 11.59%, for Ndir = 8 about
18.23%, and for Ndir = 16 about 24.04% on average.
Intuitively, the increase of Ndir implies the increase of
the sensors within the axis regions. The VADC system
enables to increase the value of NA, and consequently
enhances the performance in sensor localization.

efficient routing protocol for WSNs is being designed
on the basis of the information of the relative direction
and the hop count obtained by DLS.
