Abstract 
The steady diffusioosmotic flow of an electrolyte solution in a fine capillary slit with each 
of its inside walls covered by a layer of adsorbed polyelectrolytes is analytically studied.  In 
this solvent-permeable and ion-penetrable surface charge layer, idealized polyelectrolyte 
segments are assumed to distribute at a uniform density.  The electric double layer and the 
surface charge layer may have arbitrary thicknesses relative to the gap width between the slit 
walls.  The Debye-Huckel approximation is used to obtain the electrostatic potential 
distribution on a cross section of the slit.  The macroscopic electric field induced by the 
imposed electrolyte concentration gradient through the slit is determined as a function of the 
lateral position rather than taken as its constant bulk-phase quantity.  Explicit formulas for the 
fluid velocity profile are derived as the solution of a modified Navier-Stokes/Brinkman equation.  
The effect of the lateral distribution of the induced axial electric field in the slit on the 
diffusioosmotic flow is found to be of dominant significance in most practical situations and to 
drive the fluid towards the end of higher electrolyte concentration.  The existence of the 
surface charge layers can lead to a quite different diffusioosmotic flow from that in a capillary 
with bare walls.

layer of adsorbed polyelectrolytes were obtained by solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann 
equation for the case of an arbitrary value of Rκ  or hκ , where R is the radius of a capillary 
tube and h is the half thickness of a capillary slit [20].  Recently, the diffusioosmotic flow of a 
symmetric electrolyte solution in a fine capillary slit bearing adsorbed polyelectrolytes on its 
inside walls was theoretically investigated for the case of small potentials or low fixed-charge 
densities, and an analytical formula for the fluid velocity profile on the cross section of the slit 
was obtained [21].  In this study, however, the effect of lateral distributions of the counter-ions 
and co-ions on the local macroscopic electric field induced by the imposed electrolyte 
concentration gradient in the axial direction, which can be important, was neglected. 
In this report we present an analysis of the steady diffusioosmosis of an electrolyte solution 
with a constant imposed concentration gradient through a capillary slit bearing permanently 
adsorbed or covalently bound polyelectrolytes on its inside walls.  The charge and segment 
densities of the adsorbed polymers are assumed to be uniform throughout the surface charge 
layer, and the Debye-Huckel approximation for the electrostatic potential is employed.  
However, no assumptions will be made about the thickness of the electric double layer or the 
thickness of the surface charge layer relative to the gap width between the slit walls, and the 
lateral distribution of the induced axial electric field is allowed.  We shall derive explicit 
formulas for the local and average fluid velocities due to the application of an electrolyte 
concentration gradient along the slit walls.  These results show that the effect of the deviation 
of the induced axial electric field in the slit from its bulk-phase quantity on the diffusioosmotic 
velocity of the fluid is dominantly significant in most practical situations. 
 
2. Electrostatic potential distribution 
We first consider the electrostatic potential distribution in the fluid solution of a 
symmetrically charged electrolyte on a cross section of the narrow channel between two large

3. Induced electric field distribution 
 Since the ionic concentrations +n  and −n  in the capillary slit are not uniform in both 
axial  and lateral  directions, their prescribed gradients in the axial direction can give 
rise to a “diffusion current” distribution on a cross section of the slit.  To prevent a continuous 
separation of the counter-ions and co-ions, an electric field distribution  along the axial 
direction arises spontaneously in the electrolyte solution to produce another electric current 
distribution which exactly balances the diffusion current [4, 10, 26].

of the induced electric field on the fluid velocity was excluded. 
 
4. Fluid velocity distribution 
We now consider the steady flow of an electrolyte solution in a capillary slit with each of 
its inside walls coated with a layer of charged polymers under the influence of a constant

while the functions 2Φ  and 3Φ  denote the second orders.  As it is well known, the 
diffusioosmosis of an electrolyte solution in a capillary pore results from a linear combination of 
two effects: “chemiosmosis” due to the nonuniform adsorption of counter-ions and depletion of 
co-ions in the electric double layer over the charged surface and “electroosmosis” due to the 
macroscopic electric field generated by the imposed concentration gradient of the electrolyte 
given by Eq. (15) or (19).  The terms in Eqs. (26) and (29) involving the functions 1Φ  and 
3Φ  represent the contribution from electroosmosis, while the remainder terms (containing the 
function 2Φ ) are the chemiosmotic component.  Note that additional second-order terms 
caused by electroosmosis may exist if the electrolyte is not symmetric.

5. Results and discussion 
 For the system of an electrolyte solution in a capillary slit bearing adsorbed 
polyelectrolytes on its inside walls, the surface charge density of the wall, the surface potential 
of the wall, the fixed-charge density in the polyelectrolyte layer, and the electrokinetic 
dimensions of the system are related by Eq. (9).  Figs. 2(a) and (b) show the results of the ratio 
N/σ  for the case of  and for the case of a finite value of  (=0.8), respectively, 
as functions of 
0/ =hb  / hb
hκ  for several values of the ratio N/ζ .  It can be seen that 0/ =Nσ  as 
0=hκ  and 1// −= NN ζσ  as ∞→hκ , regardless of the values of N/ζ  and .  For 
the special case with  and 
hb /
0/ =hb 1/ =Nζ , the potential in the polyelectrolyte-filled 
capillary equals the Donnan potential everywhere, and 0/ =Nσ  at any value of hκ .  For the 
other cases with 0/ =hb , σ  has the same sign as N−ζ  and the magnitude of N/σ  
 14
is positive for given values of these parameters, equals zero everywhere in the capillary for the 
limiting case of 0=hκ , and decreases with an increase in hλ  for an otherwise fixed condition.  
When the magnitudes of N/ζ  and hλ  are relatively large, 23 / NΦ  is not a monotonic 
function of  due to the existence of the finite polyelectrolyte layers on the slit walls.  In 
the limit 
hy /
∞→hλ , 3Φ  vanishes within the surface charge layer ( ) as expected, but can 
be finite at other locations in the capillary.  For the case of 
by >
0/ ≥Nζ , as illustrated in Fig. 4, 
the value of 23 / NΦ  increases with an increase in hκ  or N/ζ  for an otherwise specified 
condition.  For the case of 0/ <Nζ , as shown in Fig. 5, 3Φ  at a given relative position not 
too close to the slit walls may not be a monotonically increasing function of hκ . 
 In Figs. 6, 7, and 8, the averaged values N/1Φ , 22 / NΦ , and 23 / NΦ , respectively, 
calculated from Eq. (38) as functions of the relevant parameters are plotted for a slit filled with 
adsorbed polyelectrolytes.  For all cases, both N/1Φ  and 23 / NΦ  are positive, and the 
dependence of these values on the parameter N/ζ  becomes relatively weak when the 
magnitude of the parameter hκ  is large.  On the other hand, 22 / NΦ  is positive as 
1/ >Nζ , negative as 1/0 <≤ Nζ , and vanishes as 1/ =Nζ .  For the case of 0/ <Nζ  
(which is not plotted here for conciseness), 22 / NΦ  can be either positive or negative 
depending on the combination of N/ζ  and hκ .  As expected, the magnitudes of all these 
three average functions increase with an increase in the value of hκ  (the dependence for 
2
2 / NΦ  is weaker than for the other two functions when hκ  is large) and decrease with an 
increase in the value of hλ , for an otherwise specified condition.  In the limiting situations 
that 0=hκ  or ∞→hλ , 0321 === ΦΦΦ  and there is no fluid flow in the capillary. 
 The dependence of the normalized average diffusioosmotic velocity */Uu  of an 
electrolyte solution in a capillary slit with each of its inside walls covered by a layer of adsorbed 
polyelectrolytes on the dimensionless fixed-charge density N  at a fixed value of hκ  and

flow is still dominated by the electroosmotic contribution and in the direction of increasing 
electrolyte concentration. 
 
6. Concluding remarks 
The steady diffusioosmotic flow of solutions of symmetric electrolytes in a narrow 
capillary slit bearing a layer of adsorbed polyelectrolytes on each of its inside walls is 
analytically studied in this project.  Solving the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation and the 
modified Navier-Stokes/Brinkman equation applicable to the system, the electrostatic potential 
distribution and the fluid velocity profile under the influence of a constant gradient of the 
electrolyte concentration are obtained in closed forms to the orders ),( Nζ  and ),,( 22 NNζζ , 
respectively.  The macroscopic electric field induced by the prescribed electrolyte 
concentration gradient through the capillary slit is a function of the lateral position rather than a 
constant bulk-phase quantity.  The contribution to the diffusioosmotic flow made by the 
position dependence of the induced electric field is of the same order [ ] as, but 
may have an opposite direction to, that made by the chemiosmotic effect, and the former is 
dominant in most practical situations, as indicated by Eq. (26).  Therefore, the effect of the 
deviation of the induced axial electric field in the slit from its bulk-phase quantity, which causes 
the fluid flowing towards the end of higher electrolyte concentration, can not be neglected in the 
evaluation of the diffusioosmotic flow rate in a capillary, even for the case of very thin double 
layer.  Our results demonstrate that the structure of the surface charge layer can lead to a quite 
different diffusioosmotic flow from that in a capillary with bare walls [16], depending on the 
characteristics of the capillary, of the surface charge layer, and of the electrolyte solution.
