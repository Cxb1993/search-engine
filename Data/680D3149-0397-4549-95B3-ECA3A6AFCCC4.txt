二、報告內容 
1. Background and Research Objective 
Machine vision provides innovative solutions in the area of industrial automation and 
inspection.  Many industrial inspection tasks such as textile [13], printed circuit boards [17], 
ball grid array (BGA) [20], passive component [19], electric components [8], wire bonding for 
Integrated Circuit (IC) [9,18], machine tools [5] and profile matching for machined parts [1], 
have used machine vision inspection to improve the productivity and quality management 
[10,11,15].  In order to achieve high efficiency and effectiveness in production, the 
development of automated visual inspection systems is essential.  The rapid growth in PCB 
production has led to the growing importance of microdrilling.  Microdrilling is characterized 
not only by drilling small holes, but also providing a smooth and precise drilling surface without 
creating unstable vibration during processing.  Due to the trend for high-density circuit on 
PCBs, the diameter of a microdill is much finer than ever before.  The inspection for microdills 
becomes more difficult and the defects are harder to be detected.  Moreover, as the size of a 
microdrill is reduced, higher probability of breakage is expected, thus increasing the production 
cost for microdrills dramatically [14].  Therefore, ensuring the quality of microdrills becomes a 
critical issue for both PCB and microdrill manufacturers.  
2. Literature Review 
The characteristics of a normal microdrill from its top view are presented in Figure 1(a) 
and its digitized mage is shown in Figure 1(b).  The lip relief planes, also called first facets or 
cutting planes, comprise with four edges, in which the cutting lip and chisel edge are two most 
important cutting edges on the first facet.  Centering point (or point) is the first contact point of 
a microdrill with the material, and cutting lips are the major cutting edges for material removal.  
Chisel edges are made by two intersecting planes, which define two primary cutting edges of a

The inspection of microdrills has been popularly discussed in the past few years.  Hinds 
and Treanor [6] used the finite element method to analyze the stresses occurring in microdrills.  
Three-dimensional models of microdrills were defined by setting node points of the drill 
geometry.  Gille et al. [3] developed ultrafine hardmetals for PCB microdrills, which reduce 
the failure probability of the microdrills.  Hazra et al. [4] presented a computer aided 
inspection system for drills by using a contact probe-type instrument.  Hazra et al. [5] later 
proposed a method that measured the geometry of drill points of microdrills by using three 
CCD cameras to obtain the silhouette of flank surfaces, and fitting the coordinate data to 
mathematical model, which was optimized by genetic algorithms, to estimate five geometry

3.1 Image acquisition 
A microdrill will be digitized by a CCD camera, when it is brought into an automated 
visual inspection system.  With the color digitizing system incorporated with the illuminating 
system, the image of the microdrill is transferred into three two-dimensional matrices, in which 
three colors, Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B), are used to represent the intensity of the object.  
To be suitable for processing, the color image functions are expressed spatially and in amplitude 
as  
fr(X, Y), fg(X, Y), fb(X, Y)     (3)

pivot, we find the next boundary point by scanning its 8-connected neighbors clockwise.  Then, 
the new boundary point becomes the new pivot.  This process proceeds until the starting point 
is reached, and the boundary is extracted.  At this stage, the number of objects segmented can 
be determined by counting the number of pixels on the extracted boundary.  If the number is 
greater than a certain amount, then the two first facets are connected.  By means of this method, 
the single- or two-object conditions can be determined and processed individually, and noise 
blobs can also be eliminated.

3.3 Boundary Representation  
3.3.1 Eigenvalues of Covariance Matrices 
Using eigenvalues of covariance matrices have been an effective way for boundary 
representation.  Tsai [16] used the smaller eigenvalues of covariance matrices to represent the 
curvature of boundary, and successfully detect corners.  Yeh and Tsai [20] applied this method 
to the inspection of BGA substrates.  Let the sequential n digital pixels describe a boundary P, 
      P= { pi= (Xi, Yi), i=1, 2, 3, …, n}    (2) 
9 
For an elliptical object, the square roots of λL and λS are the semi-major and semi-minor axial 
lengths of the ellipse, respectively.  The λS value approximates to zero when point pi is on a 
straight line or on a flat curve.  The smaller the radius of a circle, the larger the λS value 
obtained.  Also, in a sense, the sharper the corner, the larger the λS value that results.  The λS 
value of a corner point on the boundary segment is usually a local maximum, which is a peak 
when representing the boundary as a 1-D sequence, while the λS values of the boundary points 
decrease gradually away from the corner.  An example of 1-dimensional λS boundary 
representation of a first facet is illustrated in Figure 5.

3.3.2 K-curvature Corner Detection 
Curvature, defined as the change rate of slope, has been widely used in different applications 
such as feature extraction, corner detection, dominant point detection, joint point detection, 
object recognition and shape representation (Asada 1986, van Otterloo 1991, Mokhatarian and 
Macworth 1992, Cong 1998, Bandera et al. 1999, Urdiales et al. 2002).  Chang et al. (1991, 
1992) used curvature for measuring the profile of compound parts.  Sánchez-Marìn (2000) used 
Fourier descriptors and curvature function to achieve automatic recognition of biological shape.

3.4 Boundary Separation  
With different numbers of region of support, s, the boundary representation of the upper 
right first facet for the example microdrill is shown in Figure 6.  In order to filter the noise 
caused by chipping and other defects, the value of region of support ought to be set large enough.  
As shown explicitly in Figure 7, a ragged boundary representation is first obtained when using 
s=2.  The ragged condition gradually releases when the region of support, s, increases, and then 
four obvious peaks are shown in the 1-dimensional boundary diagram.  Thus, using a large 
region of support can effectively eliminate the noise.   Furthermore, after the s is decided, the 
threshold of λS can be determined accordingly.  The lower bound and upper bounds can be 
derived as following algorithm. 
Select an incremental step: ΔT; 
T=0, check =1, no_of_segment = 4 or 8;  
While (){ 
 no_of_extract = Segment_Extraction(T); // segment extraction function; 
 If (no_of_segment = no_of_extract & check =0){

3.6 Inspection of Defects 
 In order to effectively identify the defects, a quality system of microdrills is built to measure 
five features according to three inspection rules.  These features are illustrated in Figure 9.  
Among them, ϕˆ  is the gap distance measured between the two vertices a and b; 1ˆθ  is the 
estimated angle between L1 and L2; 2ˆθ  is the estimated angle between L2 and L3; 1αˆ  is the 
slope of L1; and 2αˆ  is the slope of L2.  For the second first facet, these features are expressed 
as 'ϕˆ  '1ˆθ  'ˆ2θ  'ˆ1α  and 'ˆ 2α  accordingly.  The inspection rules are described as follows: 
<Rule 1> Gap distance 
      0 < ϕˆ  < φ         (6) 
where φ is the predefined specification of the gap distance.   
<Rule 2> Parallel inspection (L1// L1’ & L2 // L2’) 
   |tan-1 1αˆ －tan-1 'ˆ1α | < ξ1 and |tan-1( 2αˆ )－tan-1 'ˆ 2α | < ξ2  (7) 
where ξ1 and ξ2 are the specified tolerances that define the deviation limits between two 
corresponding slopes.  This rule inspects the parallel properties of L1 and L2 between the two 
first facets by estimating the slopes of L1, L2, L1’ and L2’.  When both the differences of angles 
and the measured gap distance, ϕˆ , are within the specification limits, we conclude that the two 
first facets are located at the correct relative positions and pass the gap inspection. 
<Rule 3> Angle inspection

lighting device.  The testing images are in 640 × 480 pixels size and the corresponding field of 
view (FOV) is 6.4 mm × 4.8 mm, which gives 0.01 mm for each pixel length.  Examples of 
microdrills are shown in Figure 9(b), and its fixture is shown in Figure 10(c).  Fifteen 
microdrills with diameter 0.3 mm were digitized without alignment and used for verification of 
the proposed scheme as shown in Figure 11.  For image preprocessing, such as color image 
thresholding and boundary following, the library of e-Vision image processing software 
(EasyAccess 6.0) is used.  The rest of the inspection processes were implemented in C++ 
language under Borland C++ Builder 5.0 environment.

inspection process are shown in Figure 12.  The inspection results are listed in Tables 1, 2, and 
3.  Table 1 shows that the microdrills 2 and 11 were detected as gap defects by the scheme, 
since the measured distances, ϕˆ , were greater than 3 pixels.  In Table 2, all microdrills 
conform to the specification limit of parallel, which means the production of grinding Lines 1 
and 2 is under control.  However, the defects happened mainly in making Line 3 (cutting lip), 
which were detected by measuring the angle, 2θˆ , between Lines 2 and 3.  In Table 3, 
microdrills 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 13, and 15 did not pass the specification limit, which mainly 
happened in grinding facet 2.  These results also mean that the production of grinding cutting 
lips is still out of control.

4.2 Experimental Result of K-curvature Method 
 According to the obtained boundaries, the K-curvature corner detection algorithm is 
employed to detect corners. Since the largest angle within the cutting plane is known as 124 
degree, using Equation (2) with K=6, we derive the threshold T=-0.800 to detect the four corners 
on the boundaries successfully.  At this stage, the boundary of the first facets is divided into 
four line segments, which are numbered sequentially and fitted by Equations (4) and (5). In the 
last phase, the angles θ’ between the cutting lip and chisel are respectively measured by 
calculating the differences in slopes.  If the measured angle θ’ is greater than θ+δ or less than 
θ-δ, it is classified as taper or flare, respectively.  The specification of the gap or overlap 
distance, ψ, is determined as 0.05 mm, which equals to 5 pixels in the image space.  In order 
to notify the user, a go/no-go message is shown in figure 13(e), and the measurement reports are 
shown in figure 13(f in the developed system.  As shown in figure 13, for example, the 
geometry of a Type I microdrill is derived.

5. Conclusion 
The proposed project developed a translation, rotation and template-free automated visual 
inspection scheme that identifies the microdrill defects using both the eigenvalue of covariance 
matrices and K-curvature methods.  The proposed scheme first used the software library to 
extract the boundaries of first facets.  Then, the smaller eigenvalues of covariance matrices of 
and K-curvature of a given regions of support were measured. Then they were thresholded to 
separate the boundary into line segments.  After that, the least square linear regression method 
was used to fit the segments into linear equations. According to the fitted equations, the 
intersected vertices of the two first facets, enclosed angles, properties of parallel were

Subcelluar Patterns for System Biology，由於內容以 computer science 於生物醫學上之應用為
主，理解有限。由於需趕回 Vienna 搭飛機，故並未參加晚宴。 
 
二、與會心得 
1. 此會議為人工智慧領域中重要之國際會議，許多相關之研究於此研討會中討論，但最主要
為 GA、ANN 等應用。 
2. 本次會議行程參與之 session 主要以 ANN 之應用為主，發現各國對於 ANN-BP 之廣泛應
用，包括醫學、石油、生物、電子用品、交通、金融、軟體等，範圍之廣闊，幾乎無所不
及。 
3. 由於往返參加 conference 中，需經過 Vienna，藉機參觀當地之風景及人文，參觀之地點包
括維也納大學、國會、皇宮劇院等，得以瞭解奧地利人對文化、音樂、藝術的愛好、珍惜、
及享受，整體國家、人民對戲劇藝術之支持、鼓勵，且該國政府對於學術、自由、宗教、
藝術之尊重，不會無謂追求現代、崇拜美式文化，強調及保有自我文化，且接受新藝術及
文化，對於奧國之現有古蹟不斷修復、維護國家藝術遺產，讓人生活在藝術之中 
 
三、考察參觀活動 
(略) 
四、建議 
1. 與會時發現本次參與會議之台灣學者數量很少，因該研討會為 EI 所認定之 conference，是
否與經費補助方式之改變有關。 
2. 國內於 AI 研究之學者甚多，建議由國內相關之學者於明年之年會中自組一ＡＩ應用之
Session，藉機展現國內之研究成果，更藉由此研討之機會交換研究之方法與心得。
