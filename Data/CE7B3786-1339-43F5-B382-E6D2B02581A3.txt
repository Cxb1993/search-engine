 palette index table. Mostly, the image quality will be 
influenced, if a great deal of information is concealed 
in palette. For keeping the quality sake, the quantity of 
the concealed information should be limited. Thus, we 
have to determine take the image quality or high hiding 
capacity into considering according to the user 
practical situations. 
 
II. REVIEWS OF RELEATED PAPERS 
 
In this section, we review related literatures of 
some recent researchers. In 2005, Wu et al.’s proposed 
a watermarking technique based on the frequency of 
spatial color in an image palette [1]. In this paper, they 
use the palette to sort and group the colors according 
to probability of appearance. At first, the palette is 
divided into three groups: A, B and C. Both Group A 
and Group B are the effective controlled groups to 
each other, while Group C is the ineffective one, in 
which no information can be concealed. Following the 
experience of experiments, they decide an optimum 
threshold value for the palette. Then they select a 
center color and evaluate the least distance between the 
center color and each of other colors. If the least 
distance of a color from the center color is greater than 
the pre-selected threshold, the color is assumed 
ineffective and is put in Group C. They partition the 
palette into M N×  blocks of equal size and determine 
the group which the color in each block belongs to till 
all the pixels are scanned. When retrieving information, 
they also partition the palette into M N×  blocks. The 
blocks in Group A and those in Group B reveal 0 and 1 
concealed respectively, while those in Group C contain 
no concealed information.  
In [2], Tsou and Hu proposed a high capacity 
hiding scheme for the image palette. The technique 
sorts the colors according to the palette itself. An 
optimum threshold value is selected and the center 
colors are chosen. Then the Euclidean distance of each 
color to the center color is computed. When the 
Euclidean distance is less or equal to the threshold, the 
color is categorized in the same group with the center 
color. Each group is evaluated the hiding capacity 
before concealing information. Let C be the capacity 
that can be concealed, the formula is, 
 
 
where iG  is the number of color in the i-th group. 
Compute the possible concealing capacity for each 
group. Furthermore, they determine which group the 
color belongs to and hide the information orderly, 
according the concealing capacity of the group. To 
retrieve information, they use the same threshold value 
and same grouping process to obtain the origin groups 
according to the index table of grouping.  
In [6], Jo and Kim categorized the encoded 
characters in codebook into three groups,  and 0 1,G G
1G− . The method selects a threshold and computes the 
Euclidean distances between each pair of encoded 
characters. They sort the two encoded characters with 
least distance between them in a pair, which are put to 
groups  and , respectively. If the distance 
between two encoded characters is greater than the 
threshold value, put them in , where no 
information is concealed. When information is 
retrieved, the same group is located if the same 
threshold value and the same grouping method are 
applied.

III. HIGH CAPACITY DATA HIDING SCHEME 
 
In our method, we extend the aforementioned high 
capacity watermarking skills [2][5], and utilize the 
specific feature of color completely to group a palette 
so that the concealed data is increased and the image 
quality is also preserved. In the concealing procedure, 
a secret key is used to protect the hidden information 
from being tampered by a malicious person. Hence the 
ownership of an image is protected. 
Given an color image with size of N M× , we 
construct an index table P, Table 1, and a palette I, 
Table 2. The index table is as the same large as the 
image, every entry indicates a pixel. Each pixel 
displays a value between 0 and 255 which represents a 
color and corresponds with an index in palette. The 
palette is composed of 256 sets of colors, R, G and B. 
The content of palette is . A 
palette is trained from an image and it may be slight 
different from another image.

For instance, the Index table and the palette of a 
128×128 Lena image, Figure 1, are shown in Table 3 
and Table 4 respectively, after the image is transferred. 
In Table 3, the Index at the entry  is found 27, (0,0)P

 palette. On the other hand, it is not necessary to sort 
the palette in grouping that is executed before 
retrieving information. 
Step 2: Select a center for a group 
In this step, we select a center color, , and search 
another colors that fit for our need via the center. So, 
the available colors can make up a group, G. In the 
selecting center color, we determine whether the color 
 is categorized in G. If it is definite, let 
iI
iI 1i i= + , then 
determine again if the  meets our need. Continue the 
process till an available center is found. The selection 
of center color, , will affect the formation of G and 
then influence the capacity of concealed information. 
To more sufficiently use the colors, we give the 
priority to the color with more frequent appearance.

Step 3: Calculating and grouping 
Once the center, , is determined, search colors 
from  to . Using the Euclidean distance matrix 
D, find ’s that are not grouped and depart from the 
center less than threshold value, that is

}255,...,1{, +∈<− itTII hit . It is possible that 
nothing can be found because  could be quite far 
away from other colors or the colors that are apart 
from  less than the threshold could be already 
grouped. In this situation, the color  is excluded in a 
group, in other words, no information is concealed in 
the pixel. Then go back step 2 and select another color 
as center. 
iI

Step 4: Sieve the groups 
Compute the colors that are selected in step 3 
including the center colors. According to the distance 
from near to far away the center, sieve the colors to 
make the total number become a power of 2. The 
colors that are ruled out are not categorized into a 
group. Then, all sieved colors are categorized in 
Group jG , then, let . We can conceal 
information in a group with maximum size of a power 
of 2. The color beyond the size is not used temporarily. 
We categorize those unused colors into another group 
such that the availability is lifted and the capacity of 
concealing is raised. 
1j j= +
The steps are executed from step 2 to step 4 until 
. In other words, we finish the grouping 
algorithm till all 0~255 colors are settled down 
properly.

B.  Hiding procedure 
 
In the embedding method, we set up a secret key, at 
least 8 bits long. The secret key is used to lift the 
complexity of coordinates shift, and thus enhance the 
security of concealed information. We denote the k-th 
bit of the secret key with ( )kKey , and let the initial 
value for k be 1. The bit of the secret key is used one 
by one from the most right bit to the most left one. If 
the key is set longer, it takes longer to finish a regular 
cycle of coordinates shift. Hence the security is 
promoted. On contrary, it takes sooner to finish a 
regular cycle for shorter key. Hence, the security is 
demoted and the concealed information is easily 
sneaked by a malicious person. In the embedding 
procedure, it is necessary to construct a record matrix, 
S, as follows, 
   
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,255)
(1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (1,255)
(2,0) (2,1) (2,2) (2,255)

where  indicate whether the corresponding pixel 
in image is concealed with information or not in order 
to prevent the coordinate from being doubly operated. 
The doubly concealing information will cause 
information lost or mistaken. The status of each entry 
in the record matrix, S, is expressed as 0  and 1 . The 
value 1 indicates the position is treated and 0  indicates 
the position is not treated yet. If the value 0 shows up, 
we further determine the availability to conceal 
information for the corresponding location in image. 
The dimension of S is the same as that of image. The 
record at each entry of S displays the status of the pixel 
at the corresponding coordinate in image.

Our method applies the groups that had been 
categorized with grouping algorithm to conceal 
information. Considering the prospective pixel where 
we try to conceal information, we determine the group 
which the related index belongs to. According to the 
concealing value, we replace the pixel with the 
corresponding index. After the information is 
concealed, the previous secret key is used to determine 
the next concealing coordinate. The concealing steps 
are as follows: 
Step 1: Set the initial location 
Let A be the value of the most right four bits of the 
secret key and B the value of the next four bits. 
Compute the values yx, , where x A mod N≡ , 
y B mod M≡ , and N , M  are sizes of the image 
respectively. Let ( , )x y  be the initial coordinate and 
thus is the initial pixel to conceal information. 
The procedure will randomly generate an initial 
location and then shift to next location in the image. 
The following steps will describe how we can shift 
location through picking the values on the secret key. 
( , )P x y

 matrix, , which is used to determine the location is 
treated or not. The extracting procedure as follows: 
S
 
Step 1: Compute the initial location 
The system uses the most right four bits of the 
secret key, A, and the next four bits, B, to compute the 
values x A mod N≡ and , and then y B mod M≡
( , )P x y be the initial location. The proposed method 
extracts information from the initial location and then 
shifts to another coordinate according to the value of 
key value. 
Step 2: Check the current status of location 
The system uses the record matrix S and checks the 
current status according to the entry  of the 
record matrix. If the value is equal to 1, the 
information was already extracted or no information 
was concealed at the location. If the status indicates 
this spot is processed but no information is concealed, 
we have to shift the coordinate  position(s) to a new 
location. The shifted location is computed as follows: 
( , )S x y
1L
1 (( ( )) / 10 kL M N Sum S K ey⎡ ⎤= × − ×⎢ ⎥) .  
Then, the system checks the status at this new spot 
again. When , the coordinate is never 
treated. To ensure whether any information is 
concealed or not, the system executes next step.  
( , ) 0S x y =
Step 3: Check the concealed information  
After checking the status of location, the system 
determines whether the index at  is grouped or 
not. If an index is grouped, the information is 
concealed. Then, the system execute the extracting 
procedure. Otherwise, the index of coordinate could be 
far enough apart from another color, or the index could 
be categorized to different group because the distance 
is less than the threshold. In this situation, the system 
has to shift the coordinate  to generate new 
( , )P x y
2L x  
and , where the shifted location  is computed as 
follows: 
y 2L
   ,  
2 ( ) ( 1)( )     k kL K ey K ey m o d−= + 8
the value  could be one of the numbers from 0 to 7. 
Then apply the rule shown in Fig. 5 on 
2L
x  and  to 
shift coordinates. Let S x
y
( , )y = 1 be expressed that the 
index is treated. Then, the system goes back to step 2 
and checks ( , )P x y .  
 
 
 
 
 
Step 4: Extracting the information 
The system determines the group which P x( , )y is 
categorized to. Let P x( , )y  be in the group G . In 
advance, determine the location where the index of 
q
( , )P x y is located. The location represents the 
concealed information. We first transfer the value into 
binary number which is a part of information. Then let 
( , ) 1S x y =  to indicate the location is treated. For 
example, the index table is shown in Fig. 6. The index 
at  is 10 which is at the fourth position in 
group  and marked with 3. The value ( is 
transferred into binary number, (
(2, 2)P
2G 10)3
)211 , which is a part 
of concealed information. Repeat step 2 to step 4 until 
all parts of information are extracted. All the retrieved 
information is permuted orderly and obtain the hiding 
data.

IV. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
 
In this section, we demonstrate the experimental 
results of our proposed method and compare the results 
with that of Tsou and Hu’s method [2]. Our 
experiment is based on the following equipments: 
Hardware includes Intel Pentium 4 CPU 3.0 GHz with 
768 MB RAM; the OS is Microsoft Windows XP 
Professional SP-1; the application software includes 
Matlab 7.0 and PhotoImpact 12. 
In the experiment, we use the color images of Lena, 
Airplane and Baboon with size . We first 
apply PhotoImpact 12 transferring the images into *.tif 
files to get index tables and palettes. The information 
we conceal is the watermark of size n  in *.bmp 
format, Fig. 7, where n  and  are dependent on the 
selected threshold and the quantity of the concealing 
information. We also do our best to make the 
concealing quantity approach the maximum capacity in 
an image.
