such as Goyal [13] is the first person of
considering the economic order quantity
under conditions of permissible delay in
payments. Chung [7] then simplified the
search for the optimal solution to the
problem.
Furthermore, the analysis of inventory
system is carried out without
considering the effects of deterioration.
The first attempt to describe optimal
policies for deterioration items was
made by Ghare and Schrader [12] who
derived a revised form of the economic
order quantity EOQ model assuming
exponential decay. Shah [20] develops
the mathematical models in inventory
control to determine the ordering
policies of deterioration items under
permissible delay in payments. Jamal et
al. [16] extended Goyal’s model to allow
for shortages and deterioration.
However, all the above models assumed
that the supplier would offer the retailer
a trade credit period, but the retailer
would not offer the trade credit period to
the customer. For practical purpose, this
assumption is unrealistic. Furthermore,
this study assumes that the supplier
provide a permissible delay to the
retailer, likewise, the retailer adopt the
trade credit policy as well to stimulate
the demand of the products and
developing the retailer’s ordering
policies. In addition, all previously
published models assumed that the unit
purchase cost is the same as the unit
selling price per unit, this assumption is
unrealistic. Consequently, in order to
combine the inventory model of
deterioration items and practitioners,
there are assumptions are as follows：
(1) We assume that the trade credit
policy is that the supplier provides
a permissible delay to the retailer,
likewise, the retailer adopts the
trade credit policy as well to
stimulate the demand of the
products and developing the
retailer’s ordering policies.
(2) Our approach adopt that there
exists difference between unit price
( p ) and unit cost ( c ).
二、緣由與目的
在存貨理論的研究領域中，最廣泛研
究的存貨模型為經濟訂購量 EOQ 模式，
然而 EOQ 模式的基本假設與實際的存貨
狀況並不完全相符；其中之一假設為訂購
物品一到達，貨款就必須支付給供應商。
事實上，在實際的交易環境中，供應商為
了維持持續性的交易活動，通常會給予零
售 商 一 信 用 交 易 期 限 (trade credit
period)，如此零售商可以降低存貨資金的
積壓，且物品於信用交易期限到期前售
出，可賺取機會成本，讓資金做更有效的
利用。探討信用交易期限之相關文獻有
Haley 與 Higgins [14]，他們首先考慮在
允許信用交易條件下，經濟訂購批量問
題。之後，Davis 和 Gaither [11] 、
Chapman et al. [4, 5]、Daellenbach [9,
際知名之期刊。
