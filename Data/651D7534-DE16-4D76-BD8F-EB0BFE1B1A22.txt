and 3D ultrasound images of tumor in breast [17-19]. 
Various types of computer simulated images were 
created to evaluate the accuracy of AVQM.  The 
active contour model algorithm with AVQM for 
area/volume quantification has been implemented 
using Matlab software to perform image 
segmentation, edge linking, region filling, pixel 
counting and area/volume calculation on a PC based 
computer.  Finally, the accuracy of AVQM and 
DCM was compared. 
Material and Methods 
Manually outlining the regions of lesions 
requires a well-trained professional and it is a time 
consuming process.  Hence, automatic image 
segmentation methods have been extensively studied 
in many fields [1-5].  ACM (Active Contour Model) 
is one of the most popular image segmentation 
techniques.  ACM was first proposed by Kass et al., 
to detect the edge of an object [1].  Recently, it has 
been widely used for segmenting various diseases on 
most medical imaging modalities [6-10].  The 
balloon model [11] and Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) 
method [12] has been reported to be more efficient 
for ACM image segmentation.  In addition to 
segment out the lesion contour, how to accurately 
quantify the volume of the lesion in an image is very 
important.  Recently, most researchers were 
focused on developing methods to improve the 
identification of the region contour, and less work 
has been devoted to the calculation of the segmented 
region area/volume [13-15].  One of the automatic 
segmented region quantification methods being 
reported is the direct counting method (DCM), 
which is simply the summation of the maximum 
coordinate value minus the minimum coordinate 
value for each line [16].  DCM performs well for 
segmented regions with simple shapes, but it often 
fails when dealing with segmented regions of 
complicated shapes.   
The purpose of this study is to develop an automatic 
volume quantification method with edge linking and 
region filling processes (AVQM) for the ACM 
segmented regions.  The algorithm presented herein 
includes edge linking and region filling processes.  
The proposed edge linking process is based on the 
stick concept.  The stick concept was proposed for 
enhancing object’s boundary in ACM segmented 2D 
and 3D ultrasound images of tumor in breast [17-19]. 
Various types of computer simulated images were 
created to evaluate the accuracy of AVQM.  The 
active contour model algorithm with AVQM for 
area/volume quantification has been implemented 
using Matlab software to perform image 
segmentation, edge linking, region filling, pixel 
counting and area/volume calculation on a PC based 
computer.  Finally, the accuracy of AVQM and 
DCM was compared. 
The results of the ACM output are decimal 
coordinate values of a closed contour. In order to 
calculate the volume of the segmented regions, the 
boundary points with decimal coordinate values 
need to be rounded up to integer values.  This 
round-up process would create breaks to the 
originally closed contour.  To connect the breaking 
points, the concept of stick was used to produce a 
closed contour with integer coordinate values.  
Afterwards, the region filling method was applied to 
fill in the segmented regions.  Finally, the pixels in 
the segmented regions were counted and the 
area/volume was calculated.  The flow chart of the 
experiments was demonstrated in Fig. 1. 
A. Edge Linking Algorithm 
A 3×3 blank matrix was used as stick to connect 
the break points and moved throughout the whole 
image.  In our proposed method, the break points 
were defined and linked at the center position of the 
3× 3 matrix. 
Case I. 3× 3 matrix containing two boundary 
points 
The central position of the 3× 3 matrix will be 
linked if both of the following conditions are met: (1) 
the Euclidean distance of those two boundary points 
2≥ , and (2) the Euclidean distance between the 
median point of two boundary points and the central 
position of the 3×3 matrix 5.0≤ .  
Case II. 3×3 matrix containing three boundary 
points 
The central position of the 3×3 matrix will be 
linked if the condition that the Euclidean distances 
among those three boundary points are 1, 2  5  or 
1, 5 , 22  is met.  
B. Region filling 
Region filling is a simple algorithm based on the 
combination of seeds, set dilation, compliment and 
intersect.[20]  Beginning with a seed point p  
inside the boundary, the following procedure was 
used to fill the region of interest: 
,...3,2,1)( 1 =⊕= − kABXX ckk I   (1) 
where pX =0 (seed point), A  is a set containing a 
subset whose elements are 8-connected boundary 
points of a region of interest and the subset is a 
continuous close contour, B  is a structuring 
element and cA  is the compliment of set A . 
The seeds were placed at the appropriate 
positions inside the closed contour before region 
filling.  We used the local minimum values of

of the three aspects in quantifying the volume of 
segmented regions after ACM image segmentation 
process.  It is capable of quantifying the volume of 
malignant.  The proposed AVQM after ACM 
image segmentation process is more accurate and 
more reliable than DCM in quantifying the 
segmented regions.  The error of 9.24% is mostly 
coming from the ACM segmentation process and 
round-up process.
