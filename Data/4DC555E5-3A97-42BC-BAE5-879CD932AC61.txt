I. INTRODUCTION
As is widely recognized, optical sensors based on fiber gratings represent a highly promising
technology for different sensing system applications such as for sensing strain, surrounding
refractive index, temperature, bending, and other physical parameters [1-5], largely owing to
the intrinsic optical properties of fiber gratings in combination with available packaging
approaches. According to the grating period, fiber gratings can be divided into short-period
gratings (or fiber Bragg gratings, FBGs) and long-period gratings (LPGs). FBGs are based
on the grating phase-matching condition to create the forward-propagating core mode to be
coupled into the reverse-propagating core mode and cladding modes. Actually, the forward
core mode is coupled to backward cladding modes for strong and tilted gratings [6, 7]. LPGs
exist only for co-directional coupling owing to the smaller grating wave-vector. For a single
mode fiber, the forward-propagating core mode is dominantly coupled to the
forward-propagating cladding modes, one of which can be coupled back to the core mode by
selecting an appropriate grating period of an LPG. By the coupling mechanism of LPG for
cladding-to-core modes, the LPG pair interferometer has attracted the considerable attention
[8-11], whereas the cladding mode created by the front LPG is re-coupled back into the core
by the following LPG. Additionally, several reports have shown that the reverse-propagating
cladding modes of fiber grating can be coupled back to the core mode to create induced
channels by acousto-optic interactions when the acoustic wave traveling along the fiber axis
vibrates the fiber [12-15].This capability is owing to that acoustic flexural waves traveling
along the fiber for producing fiber micro-bending to cause the periodic index modulation to
function as an LPG for satisfying the phase matching between the core mode and cladding
modes.
This study first experimentally demonstrates that the backward cladding modes in an
FBG can be also coupled back to be the backward core modes to create several induced
wavelength channels by cascading an LPG. The reflectivity of the Bragg wavelength and the
induced wavelengths can be tuned by various refractive indices (RI) surrounding the fiber
grating. The scheme of concatenating an FBG and an LPG may provide another simple
method for a wide range of sensing applications[16].
II. PRINCIPLES
Phase matching can describe the coupling between the core modes and cladding
modes in an FBG cascaded with an LPG (FBG-LPG) [14]. When the vector of an LPG
equals the difference between the backward-core mode and the backward-cladding mode
wave-vectors of an FBG in order to satisfy the phase matching between the two modes, the
coupling occurs and the induced-channelλBL is located at the shorter wavelength side of the
Bragg wavelengthλB, as shown in Fig.1.
where β01(λcl)=2πncore(λcl)/cl, βcl(λcl)=2πnclad(λcl)/cl and KLPG=2π/ΛLPG. The parameters of
ncore(λcl) and nclad(λcl) denote the effective core index and cladding index at resonant
wavelengthλcl, respectively, andΛLPG represents the grating period of LPG.
The other core-mode signals propagate forward along the core-axis direction at the
distance between LPG and FBG. The light signal in FBG through means of the grating
wave-vector effect of KFBG causes the coupling between forward propagation β01( λB ) and
backward propagation -β01( λB ) of the core mode at Bragg wavelengthλB, as shown in Fig.
2(b) and the transmission spectrum (П) and reflection spectrum (І) of Fig.1. The Bragg 
condition is described as
2β01(λB) =β01(λB) - ( -β01(λB))= KFBG, (3)
The Bragg wavelengthλB can be obtained as
λB = 2 ncore(λB)ΛFBG, (4)
where β01( λB )=2πncore(λB)/B and KFBG=2π/ΛFBG. The parameter of ncore(λB) denotes the
effective core index at Bragg wavelengthλB., andΛFBG represents the grating period of FBG.
However, for a shorter wavelength λBL than Bragg wavelength λB, the grating wave
vector KFBG is not sufficiently large to cause the coupling between the forward propagation
constant β01(λBL) and the backward propagation constant -β01(λBL) of the core mode, as
shown in Fig. 2(c). The vector can only cause the coupling from the forward core mode
β01(λBL) to the backward cladding mode -βcl(λBL). This condition can be expressed by Eq.
(5):
β01(λBL) +βcl(λBL) = KFBG, (5)
When the backward cladding mode -βcl(λBL) reflects back through LPG and the wave
vector KLPG of LPG matches the difference between the backward cladding mode -βcl(λBL)
and the backward core mode -β01(λBL) at the wavelength λBL, the backward cladding mode
-βcl(λBL) can be coupled back to be the backward core mode -β01(λBL). This phenomenon
satisfies the following phase-matching condition:
β01(λBL)–βcl(λBL) = KLPG, (6)
Bragg wavelength λB and induced-channel λBL are observed in the reflected spectrum, as
shown in the reflection spectrum (П) of Fig.1. Theinduced-channel wavelength λBL can be
obtained as

coupling of the FBG wave-vector. Figure 4 shows the transmission and reflection spectra of
the FBG-LPG device. Figure 4(a) reveals a large Bragg loss dip at a wavelength of 1561.47
nm and many cladding modes of small loss dips on the left side of Bragg wavelength. For
the reflection spectrum from the FBG-LPG device shown in Fig. 4(b), the reflective
wavelength of FBG (λB) is confirmed at the wavelength of 1561.47 nm; in addition, two
induced channels (λBL2, λBL1) are created at wavelengths of 1559.50 and 1557.57 nm,
respectively. This phenomenon is attributed to the coupling of backward-propagating
cladding-modes with the core modes by the phase matching of the LPG wave-vector.
Additionally, if the propagation constant of the two induced channels is not the core mode,
the channels are leaky with respect to fiber bending and are unable to propagate over a long
distance. Thus, the induced core-mode channels observed in Fig. 4(b) can be confirmed
from the back coupling of the backward-propagating cladding-mode signals.
Furthermore, the coupling intensity of cladding mode to core mode in FBG-LPG is
investigated by using the various RI oils for surrounding the cladding region between FBG
and LPG to monitor the variation in the grating spectrum. Figure 5 shows the transmission
spectra of FBG-LPG and Fig.6 shows the loss-peak wavelengths of FBG and LPG versus
the index variation (1.42~1.46). When the index is increased in a range from 1.42 to 1.45
Figure 4 (a) Transmission and (b) reflection spectrum of FBG-LPG without
the surrounding index (RI=1).

(b)
Moreover, the reflection spectra of FBG-LPG reveal a change in the power intensity
owing to different cladding-core coupling efficiency in FBG-LPG. Figure 7 shows the
reflection spectra of FBG-LPG for use of the surrounding indices of 1 and 1.43, respectively,
to cause the Bragg wavelength loss dip on the negative-slope side of a wide-band notch.
According to the insert transmission spectra in Fig.7, loss notch of the LPG is shifted
towards the shorter-wavelength side to locate narrow-bandwidth loss peaks in the bottom of
the left side of the wide-band notch. Thus, the reflection intensity of the second induced
channel at λBL2 is increased from -43.9 to -37.9 dB owing to an increase in the coupling
efficiency from the cladding mode to core mode. Despite the ability to improve the coupling
of the induced wavelength channels with the wide-band notch shift, the reflection intensity
of the Bragg wavelength channel at λB is decreased from -13.5 to -23.1 dB owing to the
coupling increment from the core mode to the cladding mode. The reflectivity of the first
induced channel at λBL1 remains almost constant. This phenomenon is attributed to the
saturation of the coupling efficiency from the cladding mode back to the core mode -
regardless of the location of the narrow-bandwidth loss peak in the negative-slope side of
the wide-band notch.
Conversely, when the surrounding index is increased from 1.44 to 1.45, the loss notch
of LPG is shifted towards the shorter-wavelength side. Thus, the narrow-bandwidth loss dip
of the right side of the wide-band notch is shifted upwards, as shown in Fig.8. Reflection
intensity of the second induced channel at λBL2 is decreased from -37.1 to -42.6 dB, while
the reflection intensity of the Bragg wavelength channel at λB is increased from -22.5 to
-12.6 dB due to the mode coupling of LPG. When the surrounding index is greater than 1.46,
the light coupling in the space between LPG and FBG is switched from the cladding mode
Figure 7 Reflection spectra of FBG-LPG for using the surrounding index
of 1 and 1.43.
agreement by comparing the experiment results with theoretical prediction as Eq.(8).
Besides, the reflectivity of both the induced wavelength channels and the Bragg
wavelength channel can be changed due to different index surrounding the fiber grating.
This phenomenon can be applied in index sensing by measure the change of reflective
power. No matter where the narrow-bandwidth loss dip locates on the negative or positive
slope side of a wide-band notch, the change of the reflection intensity of the induced
wavelength channel is contrary to the Bragg wavelength channel. Thus, measuring the
difference of reflective power between the induced wavelength channels and the Bragg
wavelength channel can improve the sensitivity for index sensing. Figure 11 shows the
relationship of the difference of reflective power versus refractive index surrounding the
fiber grating. For the Bragg wavelength loss dip on the negative-slope side of a wide-band
notch, the sensitivities are 22.68 dB/RIU by λBL1 and 34.24 dB/RIU by λBL2, respectively.
For the Bragg wavelength loss dip on the positive-slope side of a wide-band notch, there are
large sensitivities with -867.7 dB/RIU by λBL1 and -1469.4 dB/RIU by λBL2, however, the
dynamic range is small for index sensing.
IV. CONCLUSION
This study has demonstrated the feasibility of coupling the cladding modes of an FBG with
the core modes by a cascaded LPG. Also, various RI surrounding FBG-LPG can change the
refractive power intensity of the Bragg wavelength and the induced wavelengths. For a case
involving the narrow-bandwidth loss peak to be located on the negative-slope side of the
wide-band notch, increasing the RI surrounding the FBG-LPG also increases the refractive
intensity of the induced channel due to the coupling efficiency from the cladding mode to be

Abstract— This study proposes a new fiber sensor based on the cascaded different types of
fiber gratings for applying in the simultaneous measurement of stress, temperature, and refractive
index. The fiber sensor is composed of a concatenated the fiber Bragg grating fabricated in
polarization maintaining fiber (PMFBG) and the long period fiber grating (LPG) fabricated in
photosensitive fibers. The sensing mechanism is based on the variation both of the power in the
reflection wavelength and the Bragg wavelength corresponding to the Bragg peaks to be located
on the positive or negative slope of the loss peak of LPG. Thus, it can be used for detecting the
changes of stress, refractive index, and temperature simultaneously by monitoring the wavelength
shift and power variation of PMFBG.
1. INTRODUCTION
Optical fiber sensors have been used for a wide range of applications in recent years due to their
intrinsic outstanding characteristics such as light weight, small size, and immunity against electro-
magnetic interference, etc. Thus, fiber optical sensors for practical application are attractive and
growing fast for their development By using the different optical properties of the FBG and LPG,
the strain, temperature, and refractive index can be measured simultaneously [1–7]. When a fiber
Bragg grating is fabricated in a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF), due to the different reflective
index corresponding to the fast-axis and slow-axis mode of the fiber, there are two reflective peaks
at the reflection spectrum for the applications of fiber sensors [8].
In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that a PMFBG in series with a LPG to measure
three physical parameters of stress, temperature, and refractive index simultaneously. The sensing
mechanism is based on the variation both of the power in the reflection wavelength and the Bragg
wavelength corresponding to the Bragg peaks to be located on the positive or negative slope of
the loss-dip of LPG. This scheme may provide another simple method for a wide range of sensing
applications
2. BASIC PRINCIPLES
In this study, the sensing head (PMFBG-LPG) includes a PMFBG to be cascaded with an LPG.
The LPG is fabricated by using a 248 nm KrF excimer laser to exposure on photosensitive fibers
(Fibercore PS-1250/1500) by the amplitude-mask writing technique with the periods of 380µm.
The PMFBG is fabricated on hydrogen-loaded PMF (Nufern PM1550-HP, panda fiber) by using
the phase mask writing technique with the periods of 1.0741µm. The length both of the LPG and
PMFBG of 2 cm and the separation of 1 cm between these two gratings are shown in Fig. 1.
Because of the birefringence characteristics of PMFs with different refractive indexes for the slow
and fast axes, the FBG fabricated in the PMFs shows two different reflection grating wavelengths

In the index-measured experiment, the index surrounding the sensing head is changed by drop-
ping the different-index oils on the surface of the grating in the index range from 1.34 to 1.42. The
Bragg wavelengths of PMFBG almost keep a constant as shown in Fig. 3. However, due to the
loss-dip wavelength shift of LPG to be red shift, the Bragg reflective power of PMFBG is increased
in the range of index from 1.34 to 1.42. The sensitivities both of RF and RS are 42.975 and
27.375 dBm per unit index as shown in Fig. 4.
For the temperature measurement, as the temperature is changed from 23 ◦C to 45 ◦C, the loss
dip of LPG is blue shift and the wavelengths of PMFBG are red shift. The sensitivities both
of 0.0163 nm/◦C and 0.1445 dBm/◦C for the fast axis are obtained as shown in Fig. 5 and the
sensitivities both of 0.0159 nm/◦C and 0.08 dBm/◦C for the slow axis are obtained as shown in
Fig. 6.
For measuring the effect of stress, 0, 23.96, 47.92, 63.90, and 71.88MPa are applied in the
sensor head in keeping the constant both of index and temperature. The different levels of stress
cause the variation both of the grating center-wavelength and the reflective power of PMFBG.
The grating wavelength in the fast axis (λF ) is shifted from 1540.66 to 1542 nm with the sensi-
tivity of 0.01864 nm/MPa and the grating wavelength in the slow axis (λS) is shifted from 1541.1
to 1542.42 nm with the sensitivity of 0.01836 nm/MPa as shown in Fig. 7. Besides, due to the
PMFBG to be located at the positive slope of LPG, the reflective power is increased when the grat-
ing wavelength of PMFBG is shifted toward longer wavelength. The RF is varied from −52.39 dBm
to −51.173 dBm, and RS is varied from −50.203 dBm to −49.293 dBm, corresponding to the sensi-
tivities of 0.01992 and 0.1266 dBm/MPa as shown in Fig. 8.
Because the fiber Bragg grating is not sensitive to the external refractive index, therefore, the

Fig.5 Measurement results of rotating position (a) form 0o to180o, (b) 
form 90o to 270o with the spectra of grating wavelength shift. 
 
Because these two FBGs with different reflected 
central wavelength are bound to the capillary in a way 
separated by 90°, the locations of their maximum or 
minimum central wavelengths in the optical spectra are 
separated accordingly. The corresponding results are 
shown in Fig.5. 
By using the arctangent function, the rotating angle can 
be calculated as below:   
θ ′ = tan-1((∆λ1/λ01)/(∆λ2/λ02)) , (1) 
and 
∆λ1=λFBG1-λ01,  (2) 
∆λ2=λFBG2-λ02, (3) 
where λ01 and λ02 are the origin central wavelengths of 
FBG1 and FBG2 respectively and λFBG1 and λFBG2 
represent the central wavelength locations of FBG1 and 
FBG2 respectively. However, θ ′ can only demonstrate 
an angle within the range from -π/2 to π/2. If we want to 
obtain a full round angle expression, the calculation 
formula should be modified as follows.

In this experimental procedure, arbitrary real angle 
input activates the sensor shaft to rotate, accompanied by 
the reflected central wavelength shifts of FBG, and then 
practically measured. It is a good agreement to compare 
the calculated angles and real angles as shown in Fig.7.

III.  CONCLUSION 
A novel FBG-based angular position sensor was 
experimentally demonstrated with the characteristics of 
excellent linearity, fine resolution, long-term stability, 
and negligible hysteresis. In this study, the maximum 
deviation just happened at 195° by only 0.876° . 
Regardless of the quasi-static or dynamic rotating 
condition, the highly accurate rotating position detecting 
reliability has been satisfactorily confirmed.
