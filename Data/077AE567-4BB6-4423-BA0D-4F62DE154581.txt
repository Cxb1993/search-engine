has been explored and investigated its ORR 
activity.6-9 The oxophilicity of O2 adsorption 
on Pt crystallites may be affected by the 
alloying with Au.7 Besides promotion of the 
ORR by alloying, incorporation of oxygen 
storage material such as ceria (CeO2) into 
cathode catalysts is an alternative way to 
enhance the fuel cell performance.10 The 
enhancement in dispersion of metals on the 
support and the prevention of their thermal 
sintering is contributed by CeO2.11-13  
 2
By use of TPR technique, the variations 
on surface compositions of the Pt-Au/C alloy 
catalysts can be characterized. The 
enhancement of alloying with Au and 
modification with CeO2 measured by 
electrochemical analyses can be explained in 
detail by the surface analysis and structure 
characterization of TPR and XRD, 
respectively. 
 
III. Results and Discussion 
     
Figure 1 presents the XRD patterns of 
the fresh PtxAu100-x/C alloy catalysts. For the 
monometallic Pt, peaks of Pt (111) and (200) 
were located at 2θ = 39.8o and 46.2o, 
respectively (JCPDS 04-0802). In the case of 
Au, peaks (111) and (200) were found at 2θ 
= 38.2o and 44.4o, respectively (JCPDS 
04-0784). Peak positions of PtxAu100-x/C 
alloy catalysts in the XRD patterns were 
noted between those of Pt and Au. No 
metallic Pt or Au peaks were observed in the 
patterns, indicating that various Pt-Au alloys 
were formed during the process. However, 
according to the position of (111) peaks, the 
lattice parameters of Pt-Au alloy 
nanoparticles are not a linear function of 
their alloy compositions, indicating that they 
do not obey Vegard's law and may have 
inhomogeneous alloy structures. By use of 
the Scherrer’s formula, the width of (111) 
peaks can be used to determine the particle 
size. The particle sizes of Pt-Au (dPtAu) for 
various PtxAu100-x alloy nanoparticles 
prepared in this study were about 3.6~ 4.5 
nm. The TEM micrograph for 
Pt50Au50/Ce15C is displayed in Figure 2. 
Figure 3 depicts the single scan 
voltammograms for the Pt-Au/C alloy 
catalysts using a RDE at 1600 rpm. The 
reaction rate of oxygen reduction on Pt/C 
catalysts was also compared. The ORR 
reaction at cathode may be divided into the 
following two steps14:  
2Ms + xO2→ 2MsOx    (1)  
MsOx + 2xH+ + 2xe- → Ms + xH2O (2), 
where Ms denotes atoms on the surface of Pt 
or alloy catalysts of cathode. For Pt75Au25 
catalysts shown in Figure 3, the onset 
potential is more positive than those of 
various Pt-Au/C alloy catalysts, but the ORR 
activity is restricted by removal of surface 
oxide (Reaction (2)).15 On the contrary, for 
various Pt-Au alloy catalysts, the relatively 
low adsorption rate of O2 may restrain the

was elucidated. The XRD and 
TPRcharacterizations provide the structural 
and surface information for the promoted 
alloy catalysts. The following conclusions 
have been obtained from this study: 
a. A significant enhancement of I07 for 
ORR was noted for Pt50Au50/Ce15C sample, 
when compared to unmodified Pt50Au50/C 
and Pt/C samples. 
b. The alloying of Au in Pt catalysts 
enhanced the onset potential and the current 
density in specific kinetic-diffusion control 
region. This promotion may be attributed to 
the modification of the oxophilicity and 
enhancement of the removal rate of surface 
oxide on Pt-Au alloy catalysts. 
c. XRD characterization indicated that the 
CeO2 was a textural promoter which 
increased the dispersion and decreased the 
dPtAu. For this reason, the surface segregation 
of Pt during reduction was enhanced by 
CeO2 promotion.  
d. The TPR technique provided an 
alterative aspect to the CeO2 promotion. It 
suggested that an alloy surface with a 
moderate oxophilicity and Pt-related surface 
species is essential to high I07 and onset 
potential for ORR.

Alloy nanoparticles of PdxNi100-x (x ) 20, 30, 70, and 80) were prepared by the coprecipitation method. The
surface segregation of nanoparticles, driven by the surface energy, strain energy, and reduction potential, was
studied systematically. The surface composition, surface species, and alloy structure of as-prepared PdxNi100-x
and heated Pd30Ni70 alloy nanoparticles was characterized by ESCA, TPR, and XRD, respectively. The structure
of as-prepared PdxNi100-x alloy nanoparticles is not homogeneous and changes with the alloy content x. The
surface is Pd enriched for as-prepared Pd80Ni20 alloy due to the strain energy effect. In contrast, the surface
is Ni enriched for as-prepared PdxNi100-x alloy with x ) 20, 30, and 70 due to the reduction potential effect.
In addition, a combinatory process of surface segregation and homogenization during the heat treatment was
observed on the surface of Pd30Ni70 alloy nanoparticles after heating at T > 620 K.
1. Introduction
Surface segregation is a well-known phenomenon in nanoal-
loy systems in which one of the constituents preferentially
migrates to the surface, resulting in a surface composition
different from that of the nominal composition.1,2 Surface
segregation may be driven by many thermodynamic factors, such
as surface energy and strain energy.3–11 The surface composition
due to surface segregation can be described by the following
thermodynamic equation
(X sA ⁄ X sB)) (X bA ⁄ X bB)exp(-∆Ha ⁄ kT) (1)
Here A and B are the components, Xs and Xb refer to the surface
and bulk composition, respectively, and ∆Ha is the enthalpy of
the segregated component.3–5 This can estimate the change in
enthalpy when one atom migrates to the surface while in another
atom migrates into the center. This is the driving force behind
segregation and a function of the surface energy of the
components. It implies that the surface energies of A and B
play an important role in surface segregation. The thermody-
namic basis of the driving force for surface segregation is the
drive to decrease surface energy.12 Upon heating, the system
tends to reach the most stable state by means of atomic migration
as the surface atoms rearrange stepwise.5,13 Finally, the atoms
with smaller surface energies enrich the surface until they
predominate. Thus, both the surface energy of the alloy system
is lowered and the composition in each nanoparticle is inho-
mogeneous across its diameter (concentration gradient) due to
surface segregation.7
In the literature, surface compositions and structures of
PdxNi100-x alloy have been comprehensively studied using several
techniques, such as low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger
electron spectroscopy (AES), and electron spectroscopy for
chemical analysis (ESCA). All measurements at temperatures
near 900 K displayed a remarkable segregation of Pd.14 Miegge
and co-workers proposed that the surface composition of Pd in
Pd1Ni99 and Pd5Ni95 alloys is about 20 and 50 atom % Pd,
respectively.15 Ni is alloyed with highly segregated Pd on its
surface at very low concentrations. Since Pd surface segregation
is predicted based on surface energy, enthalpy, and atomic radii,
the surface is occupied by the costly and noble Pd atoms which
are electronically modified by Ni. The activity of Pd in 1,3-
butadiene hydrogenation is improved when associated with Ni,
and this is a synergetic effect of Pd and Ni. Such alloys
demonstrate excellent performance, and their catalytic and
chemical properties can be strongly modified by surface
segregation and alloying.16
Although surface segregation and surface composition of alloy
nanoparticles affects their properties significantly, there is a
distinct lack of quantitative approaches to alloy nanoparticles
in the literature. Surface scientists focus on the surface properties
of clean and single-crystal systems instead of on those of
complex alloy nanoparticles. Therefore, relatively little informa-
tion exists regarding the surface properties of alloy nanoparticles.
If the surfaces of alloy nanoparticles can be controlled through
surface modification and surface engineering systematically, the
properties and functions of nanoparticles can be manipulated.
In this study, PdxNi100-x (x ) 20, 30, 70, and 80) alloy
nanoparticles were prepared using the coprecipitation method.17
The surface composition of the as-prepared PdxNi100-x and
Pd30Ni70 alloy nanoparticles heated at the given temperatures
was elucidated systematically and analyzed by the temperature-
programmed reduction technique (TPR) and ESCA. The TPR
technique has been used to reduce the oxygen chemisorbed on
bimetallic crystallites.18–20 It can probe the oxidation states of
noble metals and surface composition of PtRu and PdAg alloys
successfully. Since the reduction peak temperature varies with
the surface composition of the bimetallic samples, TPR can
probe the surface composition and surface segregation of the
topmost layer (<1 nm) in Pd-Ni alloy nanoparticles.
2. Experimental Procedure
A. Sample Preparations. A series of PdxNi100-x alloy nano-
particles were prepared by the co-precipitation method, as
reported previously.17 The phase diagram of the Pd-Ni alloy
system shows a disordered solid solution for all compositions.21

surface composition of Pd is only 3.8 and 4.8 atom %,
respectively, much lower than the nominal composition. This
is because Pd precipitates first during this process and the core
is enriched with Pd. On the other hand, for the Pd70Ni30 and
Pd80Ni20 alloys, the surface composition of Pd is 34.6 and 70.9
atom %, respectively. The Pd-based alloys also have structures
with a Pd-rich core and a Ni-rich shell. Therefore, according to
the ESCA analysis, it is found that surface enrichment of Ni
on as-prepared PdNi alloys is inherent due to the reduction
potential effect.
Figure 3 depicts a series of TPR results obtained from the
preoxidized Pd, Ni, and PdxNi100-x nanoparticles. In Figure 3a,
two peaks were found, i.e., a hydrogen-consumption peak at
230 K and a hydrogen-desorption peak at 360 K.20 The
consumption peak may be assigned to a reduction of
H2 + PdOf Pd+H2O (2)
The reduced Pd nanoparticles absorb hydrogen to form PdH
in the hydrogen streams. The peak located at T ) 360 K in
Figure 2a is ascribed to the hydrogen desorption of PdH.
The preoxidized Ni nanoparticles exhibited a single hydrogen-
consumption peak at around 600 K as shown in Figure 3f. This
peak may come from reduction of oxidized Ni23
H2 +NiOfNi+H2O (3)
For PdxNi100-x nanoparticles, the TPR features vary with alloy
compositions (x). In Figure 3b, the TPR features, including the
hydrogen-consumption and hydrogen-desorption peaks of Pd
for Pd80Ni20, are similar to those for monometallic Pd. Moreover,
no hydrogen-consumption peak of oxidized Ni was observed.
This implies that the surface composition of Pd80Ni20 alloy is
analogous to that of monometallic Pd. Although a structure with
a Pd-rich core and Ni-rich shell has been observed in this alloy
by ESCA (Pd:Ni ) 70.9:29.1), it is interesting to note that most
Pd atoms distributed over the outer shell mainly occupy the
outermost surface due to the strain energy effect.3,11,14
As can be seen in the TPR analysis of Pd70Ni30 shown in
Figure 3c, the trace consists of two hydrogen-consumption peaks
at 250 and 600 K, which are assigned to reduction of O atoms
chemisorbed on the Pd and Ni nanoparticles, respectively. The
TPR trace indicates that in the Pd-rich alloy the surface is
composed of Ni and Pd species; therefore, it is relatively Ni
enriched. This observation is consistent with the ESCA result.
As shown in Table 1, the surface composition of this alloy is
Pd:Ni ) 34.6:65.4, differing from the nominal composition due
to the higher reduction potential of Pd. Comparing Figure 3c
to Figure 3b, it is noteworthy that the surface compositions of
Pd80Ni20 and Pd70Ni30 are Pd enriched and Ni enriched,
respectively.
The TPR analysis of Pd30Ni70, as shown in Figure 3d, displays
two peaks ascribed to reductions of preoxidized Ni and Pd and
a strong hydrogen-uptake peak located at Tr ) 800 K. This may
be assigned to reduction of PdNi alloy. Therefore, the existence
of three reductive peaks suggests that the surface of alloy
nanoparticles is inhomogeneous and consists of three different
species (Pd, Ni, and PdNi alloy). Furthermore, the TPR of
Pd20Ni80, shown in Figure 3e, displays a lack of monometallic
Pd on the surface but rather monometallic Ni and PdNi alloy.
While according to the ESCA result the surface compositions
of Pd20Ni80 and Pd30Ni70 are similar, TPR suggests that the
surface species are different. This is because the characteristics
and surface information provided by the ESCA and TPR
analyses are different. The detection depth of the ESCA analysis
is in nanometers scale, while TPR detects information on the
topmost layer, thus providing more information about the surface
than ESCA. Therefore, the chemical state of the surface Pd
atoms on the Pd20Ni80 may be alloying Pd, while that on the
Pd30Ni70 is monometallic Pd and alloying Pd.
Column 5 of Table 1 summarizes the variations in the
chemical species found on the alloy nanoparticles using TPR,
although according to the XRD results the nanoparticles have
an alloyed structure; TPR and ESCA analyses indicate that the
structure is not homogeneous and the surface composition
suddenly changes from being Pd rich to Nibrich when the Pd
content decreases from 80 to 70 atom %. For the former, the
Pd-rich surface may be due to the strain energy effect, and in
the latter, the Ni-rich surface is attributed to the effect of
reduction potential during the preparation. On the other hand,
in the TPR results of Ni-based alloys, the surface-enriched Ni
may not only be attributed to inherently Ni-rich composition in
the bulk but also the reduction potential effect.
