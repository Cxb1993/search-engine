capacities, PC based on dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) is becoming a next 
generation large capacity system. Expansion of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) 
channels results in an increase in the complexity of the optical cross-connect. A cascade 
structure with thirtytwo-channel dropping in out-of-plane type is reported [14], the 
corresponding 100G DWDM device with the wavelength spacing of 0.8nm. The device is 
mainly determined by the vertical loss and the radiation along the normal direction to bring 
interferes destructively. To the best of our knowledge, DWDM devices based on PCs in-plane 
type have not been proposed before. 
As described in previous, the micro ring resonator is very useful as optical filters in-plane 
type. We believe that the concept realizes the same narrow linewidth property by building PC 
ring resonator (PCRR). Therefore, it is a realizable compact and high-resolution optical filter 
for DWDM system.  
 
II. Analysis of photonic crystal ring resonator filter 
The coupled-mode theory (CMT) [22-24] has been proposed for the study of PCRRs. We 
adopt the concept of micro ring resonator to design the PCRR filter. First, we remove one 
column of rods to induce straight bus waveguide, and then remove the row of rods from the 
side of the ring resonator, as shown in Fig. 1(a), where green color points indicate scatters at 
each corner of the PCRR at half of the lattice constant. In our PCRR structure, the end of the 
bus waveguides is blocked as a reflector to improve the transmission efficiency. When the bus 
waveguide is blocked, the light will be scattered and induce the back reflection, which uses a 
highly efficient coherent scatters of trapped light by the PCRR. Thus the spectrum is obtained 
resonance frequencies with narrow linewidth. Besides, the four scatters can reduce the 
back-reflection, improving the transmission efficiency. The output waveguide is changed to 
perpendicular to the side of the ring resonator. It influences a change of the light propagation 
direction for 90 degrees without oblique grating structures. The silicon material was chosen for 
the PCRR filter and was made of a square lattice of high index dielectric-rods with a refractive 
index of 3.4, a lattice constant of 550nm, and a radius of 0.17a, where a is the lattice constant. 
This choice is meant to simulate the behavior of a SOI structure operation at communication 
regions. The structure is simulated by plane wave expansion (PWE) [25] and has a PBG for 
transverse magnetic (TM) polarization which extends from 0.317 to 0.453 (a/λ). For transverse 
electric (TE) polarization no band gaps are observed. This is explained by considering the 
polarization of a dielectric-rod induced by an external electric field. The N×N supercell are 
applicable for calculation the resonance frequency of micro-cavity [16]. The dispersion 
relation of a 9× 9 supercell indeed exhibits resonance frequencies with narrow bandwidths 
extending from 0.42223 to 0.42273 (a/λ), 0.38352 to 0.38436 (a/λ), and 0.35596 to 0.3568 
(a/λ), respectively, as shown in Fig. 1(b). When the frequency of PBG is the same in the 
common band, the resonance frequency is dropped out from the PCRR. The performance of 
the designed PCRR filter has been calculated by using the two-dimensional finite-difference 
time-domain (2D FDTD) method [26]. 
To demonstrate our proposed design, we show the plots of the transmission efficiency and 
the scatter radius both for calculated results, as shown in Fig. 2(a). We take steps to further 
the PCRR filter is available for DWDM devices, which can connect other optical devices to 
take the advantage of their common use of nano-scale silicon.

scatters radius and (b) waveguide width. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Transmission spectra of the single-channel PCRR filter shows a wide FSR of 113nm, 
which allows more wavelengths of utilizing within this range. The 1549.4nm drop wavelength 
corresponds to the Q value of 3800. Insets graphically illustrate plotted terms. 
 
 Fig. 5. The PC waveguide consists of two ring resonators that with different radii r1 and r2, 
were set as 0.156a and 0.158a, respectively. 
 
The PCRR filter has been calculated by adding an extra ring resonator, where λ1 and λ2 are the 
resonance wavelengths, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. The distance between two ring 
resonators is the key of the PCRR filter. The two-channel PCRR filter for both radii of r1 and r2 
were 0.156a and 0.158a, respectively. The transmission efficiency is calculated from different 
distances of ring resonators, as shown in Fig. 6(a)-(d). However, the distance extends from 5a 
to 8a. The excellent isolated performance is exhibited at the distance of 8a, dropping the 
wavelengths of λ1=1549.4nm and λ2 =1551.5nm. This means that the PCRR filter can be 
cascaded from the end of the bus waveguide, and then achieve even more wavelengths to drop 
out from each channel. These numerical results provide a PCRR filter model to assist us in 
developing a practical DWDM device.

r10=0.1507a, r11=0.1520a, r12=0.1536a, r13=0.1549a, r14=0.1565a, r15=0.1583a, and r16=0.1598a, 
respectively. Figure 9(a) shows that the transmission efficiency which is measured from each 
output port, all the designed wavelengths of 1528.1nm, 1529.7nm, 1531.3nm, 1532.9nm, 
1534.5nm, 1536.1nm, 1537.7nm, 1539.3nm, 1540.9nm, 1542.5nm, 1544.1nm, 1545.7nm, 
1547.3nm, 1548.9nm, 1550.5nm, and 1552.1nm are showed clearly. Comparing to the PCRR 
filter without reflector, the transmission efficiency is acutely decreased by 10%~60%, as 
shown in Fig. 9(b). One of the most important considerations in designing PCRR is the 
fabrication tolerance. When the geometrical size deviates from the designed values, the 
transmission performance will decrease and the wavelength will shift. The dynamical 
tenability of PCRR filter was studied in detail, as shown in Tab 1. The PCRR filter can be 
tuned to any wavelength by adjusting the radii of the inner-ring. As the channel number 
increases, sixteen-channel PCRR filter is demonstrated, with the advantages of the low 
crosstalk ( ≤ -17.89dB) and high quality factor 6125. Besides, the PCRR filter maintains 
excellent filtering properties, such as good wavelength resolution, compact configuration, and 
high transmission efficiency. 
 
 
Fig. 8. The PC waveguide consists of sixteen PCRRs. The radii of inner-ring r1~r16 are 0.1402a, 
0.1412a, 0.1423a, 0.1434a, 0.1445a, 0.1457a, 0.1468a, 0.1480a, 0.1494a, 0.1507a, 0.1520a, 
0.1536a, 0.1549a, 0.1565a, 0.1583a, and 0.1598a, respectively. 
 
IV.  Conclusions 
In this paper, we have proposed a new design of optical filter based on a two-dimensional 
photonic crystal ring resonator structure with N-channel model. This device resolves the 
challenge of the narrow wavelength spacing for the in-plane type light propagation. 
Furthermore, we have also developed a sixteen-channel filter to demonstrate the feasibility. 
The transmission efficiency is larger than 90% and the inter-channel crosstalk is less than 
-17.89dB. The PCRR filter has a spectral resolution of 1.6nm due to its high quality factor 
(Q~6000), which makes it suitable for 200G DWDM applications. This approach represents a 
novel technique for creating high-Q filters of the in-plane type that furthermore opens the 
possibility of the photonic integrated circuits (PICs).
