Abstract
Design of experiments (DOEs) are useful techniques for
improving the reliability (or quality) of a product. The
main work of a DOE is to select significant factors that
affect the product reliability (or quality). Then the
significant factors can be set at the levels which lead to
reliability improvement. One of the basic assumptions of
DOEs is that the (logged) observations at each run
follow a normal distribution. In practical applications,
normal and extreme value distributions are much alike.
They may fit the data at hand well in practical
applications. However, their predictions may lead to a
significant difference. A well-known assertion:
“moderate departures from normality are of little
concern in the fixed effects analysis of variance
(Montgomery, 1997)”. The main purpose of this project
is to evaluate the assertion by investigating the impact of
mis-specification between normal and extreme value
distributions on the precision of selecting significant
factors for a screening experiment.

1. Introduction
Owing to the strong competition in markets,
continuously improving the reliability (or quality) of a
product has become a necessary condition for the
manufacturer to compete with others. Design of
experiments (DOEs) are useful techniques for improving
the reliability (or quality) of a product. The main work of
a DOE is to select significant factors that affect the
product reliability (or quality). Then the significant
factors can be set at the levels which lead to reliability
improvement.
One of the basic assumptions of DOEs is that the
(logged) observations at each run follow a normal
distribution. In practical applications, normal and
extreme value distributions are much alike. They may fit
the data at hand well in practical applications. However,
their predictions may lead to a significant difference.
As stated above, the analyst is usually confronted
with the problem of selecting an appropriate distribution
based on whatever data are available. Many excellent
researchers have given considerable attention to such a
problem of discriminating between two distributions for
some given observations. For example, White (1982)
investigated the problem of model mis-specification
when maximum likelihood techniques are used for
estimation and inference. He also obtained the
asymptotic properties of the quasi-maximum likelihood
estimator with mis-specification under some regular
conditions. Atkinson (1969, 1970), Chen (1980),
Chambers & Cox (1967), Cox (1961, 1962), Jackson
(1968), and Dyer (1973) studied the discrimination
problem in general between two models. Besides,
Jackson (1969), Quesenberry & Kent (1982), and Wiens
(1999) studied the discrimination problem between
lognormal and gamma distributions. Bain & Englehardt
(1980) and Fearn & Nebenzahl (1991) studied the
discrimination problem between Weibull and gamma
distributions. Gupta & Kundu (2003) considered the
discrimination problem between Weibull and generalized
exponential distributions. Gupta & Kundu (2004)
considered the discrimination problem between gamma
and generalized exponential distributions.
Kundu, Gupta, and Manglick (2005) considered the
discrimination problem between lognormal and
generalized exponential distributions.
Among the discrimination problems, the one for
Weibull and lognormal distributions is particularly
important and has received much attention, this is
because the two distributions are the most popular ones
for analyzing the lifetime of electronic products.
Dumonceaux & Antle (1973) adopted the ratio of
maximized likelihood (RML) in discriminating between
4If ),(~ buExtremeY iij  (1)
For two pre-specified constants 1  and
)0( 010  , if 1hE , then we say that hF is
practically significant; while, if 0hE , then we say
that hF is practically negligible.
Let  hh EE ,  be the corresponding )%1(100 
confidence interval of hE . Then an identification rule
)ΙR(  is proposed as follows:
IR:  For mh 1 , hF  is identified as a statistically
significant factor if  hh EE ,0 ; while hF  is identified
as a statistically negligible factor if  hh EE ,0 .
3.2 Measure of Selection Quality
Suppose that there are )( ms   factors of practical
significance. In this case, we will assume without loss of
generality that sFFF ,,, 21  are the significant factors.
Let S  denote the set of indices of all significant factors,
i.e.,  s,1,2,3,S  .
Define miEEEEE im  1,|),,,( 21  .
The following two subsets s  and 0  of   are
critical to the decision maker: 1121 min|),,,(   hshms EEEEE 
and  01210 min|),,,(   hmhm EEEEE  .
That is, s and 0  represent the sets of all
practically significant effects and all practically
negligible effects, respectively. We say that Rule IR
gives a correct decision (CD) for
smEEEE  ),,,( 21 

, if hF  is identified as a
statistically significant factor for all Sh . Also, we say
that Rule IR gives an incorrect decision (ICD) for
021 ),,,(  mEEEE 

, if hF  is identified as a
statistically significant factor for some h, mh 1 .
Our goal is to select all practically significant factors
with a minimum probability of correct decision, while
controlling the maximum probability of false selections
for negligible effects as small as we like. Symbolically,
what we are of interest are the following quantities:
)IR|CD(inf EE Ps   and )IR|ICD(sup 0 EE P  , where
)IR|CD(
E
P  and )IR|ICD(
E
P denote the
probabilities that Rule IR gives correct decisions and
incorrect decisions for E

, respectively.
For simplicity, )IR|CD(inf EE Ps   and
)IR|ICD(sup
0 EE
P will be simplified as I(CD) and
S(ICD) in the following sections, respectively.

For mi 1 , based on the observations  ijY nj 1 , i and

5. Evaluation of the Probabilities of CD and
ICD with Correct Specification
The whole work consists of the following two cases:
Case 1. If the data at each run follow a normal
distribution and get a correct identification.
Case 2. If the data at each run follow an extreme value
distribution and get a correct identification.
Case 1.
Obviously, by the orthogonality of )2( mrL , it is easily
seen that )( NhE

’s are independent. Thus, based on
Equations (7), (9), and (10), the expressions for I(CD)
and S(ICD) can be obtained as follows:

6. Evaluation of the Probabilities of CD and
ICD with Mis-specification
The work of computing the probabilities of CD and ICD
with mis-specification comprises the following two
parts:
Case 3. If the data at each run follow a normal
distribution, but get mis-identified as an
extreme value distribution.
Case 4. If the data at each run follow an extreme value
distribution, but get mis-identified as a normal
distribution.
Case 3.
In such a case, the true main effect of hF  is )( NhE .
What we want is to evaluate the probabilities of CD and
ICD for the CI in Equation (18). To do so, we need first
the asymptotic distributions of )(EhE

and b

with
mis-specification. According to the result (2) of Theorem
1 of Yu (2007b), it can be shown that for sufficiently
large n , the joint distribution of )(EhE

 and b

 with
mis-specification approximately follows the following
bivariate normal distribution:

In fact, I(CD)s for Case 1 and Case 3 depend on

we will explore the impacts of mis-specification on I(CD)
and S(ICD) separately. Figure 2 shows the plots of I(CD)

Conclusion
This paper investigated the impact of mis-discrimination
between normal and extreme value distributions on the
precision of selecting significant factors for a screening
experiment. Specifically, taking  134 2 L  as an example,
we investigate the impacts of mis-specification between
normal and extreme value distributions on the
probabilities of correct and incorrect selections for a
screening experiment. For each of these two
distributions, the probabilities of correct and incorrect
selections under correct specification and
mis-specification are computed. From the results, it is
observed that: (1) for both of normal and extreme value
distributions, the probabilities of correct and incorrect
decisions are all increasing with the sample size; (2) for
fixed sample size, the probabilities of correct decision
(the probability of incorrect decision) for both of normal
and extreme value distributions with 2s  are less
than those with 1s ; (3) for normal distribution, the
