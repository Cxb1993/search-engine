英文摘要： Poly-p-xylylene or as the commercial trade name, 
Parylene, is a promising biomedical coating because of 
its advanced processibility and excellent intrinsic 
biotolerability. For instance, the first FDA approved 
drug-eluting stent (Cypher stent, J&amp；J) uses a 
vapor deposited polymer (parylene) as adhesion 
promoter. The commercially available non-
functionalized parylene coatings lack, however, anchor 
groups for further modification and therefore would 
fail as potential coating candidates to anchor 
appropriate drug molecules to the surface of the 
devices. In contrast, we have recently developed 
biomedical coatings based on a novel class of vapor-
deposited polymers: functionalized poly-p-xylylenes. 
In this one-year research project, we have further 
identify necessary specifications for the CVD 
copolymerization, while demonstrating the fundamental 
feasibility of multi-functional coatings. Moreover, 
the CVD-based coatings can be generically applied to a 
wide variety of substrates – including polymer, such 
as PTFE, stainless steel, Nitinol, and tungsten being 
the most common materials used in cardiovascular 
implants. 
The commercially available non-functionalized poly-p-
xylylene coatings (parylenes) however lack anchor 
groups for further modification and therefore fail as 
effective carriers for biomolecules. In recent years, 
we successfully refined the Gorham process to prepare 
functionalized poly-p-xylylenes. These polymers show 
all the advantages of their commercial siblings, but, 
in addition, provide versatile anchor gruops for 
sophisticated surface modifications. Hence, this 
technology represents essentially a one-step coating 
procedrue to generate functionalized surfaces without 
requiring any kind of post-treatment once the films 
are deposited. In addition to the availability of 
anchor groups, the simplicity in providing a wide 
range of functional groups, the excellent adhesion to 
various aubstrates, and its applicability to surfaces 
with three-dimensional geomertries are key advantages 
when compared to polymers deposited by solvent-based 
methods.

of polysaccharides. In fact, we established the availability of the aldehyde groups on the surface of the polymer 
films via chemical conversion with hydrazides to yield hydrazone linkages and by tethering model sugars to the 
reactive surfaces.[10] In addition, a new type of biofunctional surface based on alkyne-containing 
poly-p-xylylene has also been prepared via CVD polymerization of diethynyl-[2,2]paracyclophane and 
4-ethynyl-[2,2]paracyclophane. These reactive coatings are applicable to a wide range of substrates and can be 
modified by subsequent spatially-directed spatially-directed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (click 
chemistry).[11]  The first photo-definable poly-p-xylylene, poly(4-benzoyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene), has 
shown its compatibility with photolithographic processes by fabricating micron-sized hydrogel elements.[12] or 
to prepare discontinuous surface patterns[13] on 3-D microscale objects, and on curved substances.[14] 
Micro- and nanostructured surfaces are of fundamental importance to a range of applications including 
electronics and biotechnology. For instance, bioanalytical diagnostic devices, such as DNA or protein arrays, 
artificial substrates to mitigate cell-growth regulation, or next-generation micro/nanofluidic systems will 
require precisely structured surfaces. It can be expected that further progress in these and other areas of 
biotechnology will continue to fuel the need for simple and scalable surface structuring methods that result in 
both, topologically and chemically defined surfaces. Previous reports have also shown that these 
functionalized parylenes have provided a dry and clean route for creating surface patchy structures during or 
after the vapor-based deposition process.  The resulting micro- or nano- features on the surface with 
equipped functional group can render topologically can chemically defined anchoring sites for precise control 
over microenvironments.  More importantly, the patterning technique can be applied to flat (2D) and curved 
surfaces (3D) regardless of materials, dimensions and geometries. 
 
 
3. 研究方法 
Synthesis of substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes 
Functionalized poly(p-xylylenes) constitute an versatile class of reactive polymers that can be prepared in a 
solventless process via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization from substituted 
[2.2]paracyclophanes. We first synthesized a series substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes with functionalities 
including amine, aldehyde, hydroxyl, carboxylic acids, vinyl, alkyne, and maleimide as shown in Figure 1.  
The synthesis of the substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes followed previously established protocols.[1, 15] and 
has worked out well in our laboratory and new precursors are constantly prepared.  These substituted 
[2.2]paracyclophanes are then subsequently used for the study of CVD polymerization on a variety of 
different substrate materials including poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, glass, silicon wafer, stainless 
steel and poly(tetrafluoroethylene). And the following studies were conducted:

Surface nano-/micro- structuring 
Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN), a scanning probe microscopy-based nanolithographic technique that delivers 
“chemical inks” to substrates, was demonstrated on the CVD coated surfaces. 
(4-ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) was used as an example to proof the concept in the study. Next, the 
ability of these substrates to support DPN nanopatterning was confirmed via spatially controlled Huisgen 
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. This reaction involves ethynyl groups presented on the CVD coating, which 
spontaneously convert with azides in the presence of a copper catalyst. The resulting nanostructures were 
characterized by using AFM and fluorescence microscopy. 
 
 
4. 結果與討論 
Reactive polymer coatings can improve the interfacial biocompatibility of biomedical surfaces or can be 
compatible with complex biological features as they represent designable interlayers. Many key features for 
biological applications have been added during the past few years. Recently, the uses in microfluidic devices, 
fabrication of non-fouling surfaces, and the precise surface modification for complex 3-D devices have also 
been demonstrated and were discussed in this article. These advanced coatings provide a technology platform 
that will improve active long-term control and improved mimicry of biological systems. Development of these 
technologies will hold promise for enabling studies in biological and medical areas, such as control of cell/cell,

particle manipulation [33,34], self-assembly [35,36] 
and controlled drug delivery [6,37,38]. 
It is clear that the intrinsic surface properties 
of such microfabricated devices, such as hydro-
phobicity/hydrophilicity, cationic/anionic sur-
face charges, surface morphology, or the chemi-
cal makeup of the surface, will critically affect 
bioanalytical performance. Due to the high 
surface-to-volume ratio typically encountered 
in microfluidics, even slight inhomogeneities of 
the surface make-up can result in poor opera-
tional performance or, in the worst case, cause 
device malfunction [39]. A precise engineering 
strategy for producing well-controlled syn-
thetic surfaces is increasingly important and 
the development of sophisticated surface modi-
fication protocols has become a proliferative 
subfield of microfluidics (table 1). Currently 
available methods on modifying microf lu-
idic surfaces include, but are not limited to, 
polymer grafting, plasma treatment, UV/
ozone treatment, salinization, phospholipid 
polymers, adsorption of detergents, proteins, 
layer-by-layer assembly (LBL), sol-gel and sol-
vent extraction. Recent review articles provide 
a comprehensive overview of these techniques. 
Interested readers should refer to the follow-
ing articles [10,11,40–46]. table 1 compares CVD-
based reactive coatings with other methods 
that are currently employed for the surface 
modification of microfluidics.
The continuously increasing complex-
ity of microfluidic systems will require the 
development of methods for the precise and 
stable fabrication of additional features, such 
as surface patterns, within microfabricated 
devices [47–53]. If these patterned substrates can 
be easily integrated into microfluidic systems, 
the surface modification approach can address 
the need for chemically and spatially defined 
micro-/nano-domains. Patterned microf lu-
idic systems may be of benefit to a number of 
applications in biotechnology, such as capillary 
electrophoresis, micro-/nano-assays, separa-
tion devices and targeted diagnostic devices. 
Currently employed methods for creating pat-
terns in microfluidic channels either rely on pat-
terning of a flat substrate, which is subsequently 
sealed to a microstructure, or the use of fluid 
patterning. Specific processes include micro-
fluidic patterning [54], stencil masking [55,56], 
laminar flow patterning [57–59], robotic spot-
ting [60–62] jet printing [63,64], photolithog-
raphy [65–69], microcontact printing [70] and 
selective plasma etching [71]. Although these 
patterning methods have been used to pattern 
cells [70,72], proteins [57] and hydrogels [68,69,73] 
within microfluidic systems, they often are asso-
ciated with several shortcomings. For example, 
laminar flow-patterning techniques can only 
achieve continuous patterns. Photolithographic 
processes usually change surface properties and 
topology of the device simultaneously. Other

functional moieties for enhanced bonding 
strength. For the case of PDMS, it is a siloxane 
elastomer that lacks functional groups to affili-
ate with adhesives and usually requires oxida-
tive environments, such as plasma treatment or 
UV/ozone treatment to induce silanol groups 
for bonding purpose [76]. However, hydropho-
bic recovery tends to remove silanol groups 
within minutes to hours from the surface, and 
the bonding procedure is usually required to 
proceed immediately [10], which limits the 
long-term usability of these methods. Similarly, 
thermoplasts can result in hydrophobic sur-
faces with poor wettability and weak bonding 
strength. In addition, bonding methods asso-
ciated with excessive heating and melting are 
also not favored for thermoplasts [74]. A number 
of review articles have covered a diverse set of 
topics including adhesive bonding, welding, 
solvent bonding, thermocompression bond-
ing and other methods for silicon/glass-based 
wafer bonding [11,15,74,75,77,78]. 
Over the past few years, we [79,80] and oth-
ers [81–88] have explored the use of chemical 
vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization to 
develop surface modification protocols for a 
wide range of different substrate materials [89]. 
The CVD polymerization process shows prom-
ising features, such as conformance to substrate 
topology, pinhole-free coverage even in very 
thin films and the ability to penetrate [90] and 
coat complex geometries [91]. CVD polymer-
ization often does not require solvents, plas-
ticizers, catalysts or accelerants, minimizing 
cytotoxic effects by excluding potential leach-
ing of low-molecular-weight additives [92,93].

 Controlled nonfouling modification 
& microfluidic channels
One of the major challenges in microfluidic 
devices is the prevention of nonspecific interac-
tions of the analyte with the large surface area 
available in microchanels. To reduce nonspecific 
interactions, a photodefinable polymer, poly(4-
benzoyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) [97], prepared 
by CVD polymerization was used for fabrication 
of hydrogel elements with dimensions smaller 
than 5 µm. Results from infrared reflection 
absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) and x-ray 
photoelectron (XPS) spectroscopy were found 
to be in accordance with the predicted polymer 
structure of poly(4-benzoyl-p-xylylene-co-p-
xylylene). The photoactivated carbonyl groups 
of the polymer have the potential to enable light-
induced crosslinking of molecules and can rap-
idly react via insertion into CH- or NH-bonds 
upon photoillumination at 340 nm [98,99]. In 
Figure 3, the example shows a microchannel 
consisting of deep and shallow areas that was 
incubated with fluorescently-labeled fibrinogen 
after poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) modifica-
tion. Based on this method, spatially controlled 
confinement of nonfouling molecules and PEO, 
and the selective adsorption of proteins including 
albumin and fibrinogen within microchannels 
were demonstrated.
Furthermore, poly(p-xylylene-4-methyl-2-
bromoisobutyrate-co-p-xylylene) was synthesized 
by CVD polymerization [100] and, subsequently, 
poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methac-
rylate] hydrogels were prepared via atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP) on a CVD-based 
initiator coating. Although the focus of this 
work is on a flat substrate made of PMMA, this 
surface modification technique can be applied 
to microfluidic systems fabricated from glass, 
quartz, metal or other polymers [91]. The result-
ing poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether 
methacrylate] hydrogels have shown remarkable 
nonfouling properties and can be used for pro-
tein and cell adhesion patterning, as shown in 
Figure 4. With respect to the quantitative ana lysis 
of protein adsorption on poly[oligo(ethylene gly-
col) methyl ether methacrylate] surfaces, a recent 
study has shown an ultra-low protein coverage 
using a microtubule–kinesin model. Kinesin 
molecules first adsorb to the tested surfaces, 
followed by microtubules binding to the active 
kinesin on the surface [101]. The landing rate 
of microtubules is determined and correlated 
to the adsorption density [101]. A significantly 
decreased kinesin density of 0.16 ± 0.02 µm-2 – 
a 20-fold reduction compared with (EG)
3
OH-
terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) 
surfaces – was observed. 
 Surface modification within 
microchannels
The important question of whether the concept 
of CVD polymerization is applicable to micro-
channels was addressed only recently [47,102]. A 
series of functionalized poly-p-xylylenes were 
prepared using CVD polymerization within 
microfluidic devices, which were comprised 
of straight and meandering microchannels 
(Figure 5) [90]. Silicon substrates were used as 
test fixtures, as they can be reversibly sealed onto 
PDMS molds, then coated via CVD polymeri-
zation and removed for final examination. XPS 
imaging confirmed that the entire microchannel 
footprint was devoid of any detectable amounts 
of silicon due to an homogeneous polymer film, 
which was thicker than 10 nm [103]. Atomic force 
microscopy (AFM) height profiling and imag-
ing ellipsometry further verified the presence of 
polymer deposition on entire microchannels, 
and aspect ratios as high as 37 were found [90].
Figure 4. Fluorescence (A & B), and phase contrast (C & D) micrographs 
show nonfouling property of controlled protein- and cell-resistance on 
patterned poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] 
surfaces synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization on chemical 
vapor deposition polymerization approach to prepare vapor-based 
initiator coatings.

the resulting films can be stored for extended

a substrate coated with poly(4-aminomethyl-p-

substrates, and Gleason and co-workers have shown that a wide
range of polymer coatings can be prepared by plasma polymer-
ization or initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD).6 In cases
where hot filaments were used for initiation, radical polymeriza-
tion can occur, which yielded chemically defined conformal
coatings. In addition, patterning the surface with an initiator
can result in microstructured polymers.12 An excellent review
broadly covering the recent development of CVD polymers was
published elsewhere, and the interested reader should refer to this
article for detailed information.13
Wheras several vapor-based polymerization processes exist, the
polymerization of [2.2]paracyclophanes (PCPs) to form poly(p-
xylylenes) (PPXs) following the Gorham process14 is among the
best-established systems. During the Gorham process, thermal
treatment of the starting material, [2.2]paracyclophanes, results in
reactive species that are spontaneously deposited on the target sur-
faces that are typically maintained at or below room temperature.
Unsubstituted and mono- and dichloro-substituted poly(p-
xylylenes) have been marketed under the brand names parylene
N, C, and D and are already widely used in packaging semicon-
ductors and biomedical devices.15 For instance, the parylene C
polymer is FDA-approved for coating the interior surfaces of
blood bags or as base coatings for cardiovascular stents.16 For
experimental details, a review of earlier work, and a discussion of
physicochemical models of parylene deposition, we direct the
reader to a comprehensive monograph.17

Chen and Lahann Invited Feature Article
The focus of our group in this area has been on using the CVD
polymerization of substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes to prepare a
wide variety of novel poly(p-xylylenes) with functional groups
appropriate for subsequent polymerization (Scheme 1).
The actual CVD process used for the polymerization of
substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes is an adaptation of the Gorham
process developed for the deposition of conventional parylene
coatings.14 In all cases, cyclic [2.2]paracyclophanes (dimers) are
sublimated under reduced pressure (0.2-0.3 Torr) and subse-
quently introduced into a furnace at temperatures between 600
and 800 C. At these temperatures, homolytic cleavage of the
dimers can occur without thermal decomposition of the func-
tional groups. After this initiation step, the quinodimethane
molecules are transferred into the deposition chamber and will
polymerize onto the substrate of choice, which can bemaintained
at a controlled temperature between-40 and 60 C. By synthesiz-
ing [2.2]paracyclophanes with a wide variety of functional
groups,21-25 a range of polymer coatings with different reactive
sites can be prepared. CVD polymerization of [2.2]paracyclo-
phanes typically yields conformal coatings that exhibit mechan-
ical integrity and low dielectric constants.17 A suitable installa-
tion for the CVDpolymerization process is shown in Figure 1. A
conventional one-source configuration yields polymers with a
homogeneous functional group distribution, and binary or
tertiary gradients can be synthesized from two-source or three-
source configurations, respectively. Details on the preparations
and applications ofmultifunctional and gradient CVDpolymers
will be further discussed in a later part of this article.
It is now well-established that a diverse set of functionalized
polymer coatings can be synthesized from substituted [2.2]para-
cyclophanes (Scheme 2). For example, carbonyl-functionalized
[2.2]paracyclophanes havebeenutilized in various applications.26-28
Aldehyde-functionalized poly(p-xylylene) coatings maintain a high
reactivity of functional groups afterCVDpolymerization,whichhas

of substrates, such as plastic, metals, glass, or silicon. These
CVD-coated substrates were then used as the basis for the
spatially directed click reaction, namely, Huisgen 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition (Figure 2). Prior to CVD polymerization, ethynyl-
[2.2]paracyclophane was prepared from commercially available
[2.2]paracyclophane. The resulting poly(4-ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-
p-xylylene) was then used for a click reaction with an azide-
containing biotin-based ligand in the presence of Cu(II) sulfate
and sodium ascorbate. Sodium ascorbate generates Cu(I) ions in
situ from CuSO4, which functions as the actual catalyst. To
further ensure spatial control over the cycloaddition reaction, a
microcontact printing (μCP) approachwasdeveloped on the basis
of acetylene-functionalized reactive coatings. A patterned PDMS
stamp was inked with a solution of CuSO4 and brought into
contact with the substrate. Fluorescence microscopy was used to
assess the spatially directed immobilization. This study clearly
establishes that proteins can selectively bind to regions where the
CuSO4 solution was microcontact printed. One of the key
attributes of this approach is the flexibility of the bioconjugation
platform,which enables broad applicability to diagnostics,micro-
arrays, biosensors, and biomedical device coatings.
2.2. Immobilization via Hydrazone Linkers. Hydrazone
formation (i.e., the conversion of aldehydes with a hydrazine
or hydrazide) is a widely used immobilization reaction with rapid
reaction kinetics and high specificity. In a complementary effort,
poly(4-formyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) polymer films were
developed25 as biomedical coatings that enable the selective
immobilization of biomolecules via formation of hydrazones.
Here, the precursor was 4-formyl[2.2]paracyclophane, which is
readily available from [2.2]paracyclophane. Again, 4-formyl-
[2.2]paracyclophane is first sublimated and then homolytically
cleaved to yield poly[(4-formyl-p-xylylene)-co-(p-xylylene)] de-
posited on a cooled substrate. No signs of side reactions were
observed. Moreover, this reactive coating exhibited good adhe-
sion to a wide variety of substrates such as gold, silica, glass, and
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and showed excellent stability in
aqueous and organic solvents.
The selectivity of hydrazides and hydrazines toward aldehydes
and ketones makes them suberb binding partners for the im-
mobilization of biomolecules. For instance, dihydrazide linkers
can covalently bind to the aldehyde groups of the reactive coating
creating anchor sites for disaccharides (Figure 3).25 A similar
Figure 8. Schematic description of the 3-D microstructuring technique. The method comprises two process steps: deposition of the
photodefinable CVD coating (step 1) and subsequent projection lithographic rendering (step 2). Fluorescence micrographs show that this
technique can be applied to 3-D and complex surfaces including (a) microspheres,26 (b) fibers,48 (c) microchannels,49 and (d) stent devices.48

category, surface patterns are formed via physical masking
(assisted deposition) or are based on metal inhibitors (selective
deposition), which have been previously applied to the substrates.
After CVD polymerization, reactive polymers were found only
over the expected surface areas. Table 2 summarizes the
characteristic features and limitations of using these patterning
techniques enabled by CVD-based reactive coatings. In the
following section, we will address each approach in more detail
and describe some specific examples.
3.1. Microcontact Printing (μCP). Microcontact printing
(μCP) is a widely used approach to patterning surfaces on various
types of substrates42 and can be simply applied to reactive coat-
ings with a choice of inks on selected functional groups. In one
example, μCP was used to pattern substrates by a PDMS stamp
with a set of parallel lines of (þ)-biotinyl-3,6,9-trioxaundecanedi-
amine.22Microstructured substrates were stable for at least 7 days
at room temperature. For the spatial control of cell attachment,
biotin/streptavidin conjugation was used to immobilize a cell-
binding antibody. As shown previously in Figure 4, the surface
patterns were still recognized by cells.22 In an extension of this
initial work, we further showed that reactive polymer coatings
could also be modified with DNA. By using supramolecular
nanostamping (SuNS)45 technology on poly(4-formyl-p-xylylene-
co-p-xylylene), controlled DNA attachment was resolved for
feature sizes as small as 100 nm.46 The combination of SuNS
with the CVD technology allowed for the extension of the
nanopatterning protocols to a range of different substrates. In
proof-of-concept experiments (Figure 6), nanopatterns were pre-
pared onpolystyrene, acrylic, andPDMSwithout an alteration of
the immobilization protocol. Because of its simplicity, a broad
spectrum of applications can be contemplated in the field of bio/
nanodevices.
3.2. Photopatterning. Another post-CVD micropatterning
method involves the projection of ultraviolet light onto a photo-
reactive coating, such as the above-mentioned poly(4-benzoyl-p-
xylylene-co-p-xylylene). For example, photodefinable polymers
have been used to immobilize an array of PEG hydrogels on
the substrate surfaces28 or to prepare discontinuous surface
patterns27 on 3-D microscale objects (Figure 7). Because of their
solventless processing capabilities, CVD-based reactive polymer

signals could be detected only in areas that were masked during
CVD polymerization. This was true for the entire range of
feature sizes from 150 to 25 μm. Correspondingly, fluorine, a
representative element of poly(4-pentafluoropropionyl-p-xyly-
lene-co-p-xylylene), was detected only in areas not masked during
CVD polymerization (Figure 10). The chemical reactivity of the
VAMPIR microstructures was also verified by covalent binding
of a biotin hydrazide followed by self-assembled TRITC-strep-
davidin as shown in the fluorescence micrographs in Figure 10.
In another example,21 a PDMSmicromoldwas used during the
deposition of poly(p-xylylene-4-methyl-2-bromoisobutyrate-co-
p-xylylene) to create an initiator coating on the substrate surface.
Subsequently, atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) was
performed to form hydrogel films on the modified surface as
shown in Figure 11. The stability of the polymer patterns was
examined by immersing the coating in a range of different
solvents, including methanol, ethanol, acetone, and chloroform,
and also by a tape test in conjunction with a visual inspection.
Microstructured poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether
methacrylate] hydrogel was evaluated by both protein adsorption
and cell adhesion. Owing to the nonfouling property of poly-
[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate], fibrinogen
adhered only to areas where nopoly[oligo(ethylene glycol)methyl
ether methacrylate] was present (i.e., areas without initiator
coatings (Figure 11a,b). Similarly, murine fibroblast (NIH3T3
cells) grew only on areas that corresponded to nonmodified
surfaces as shown in Figure 11c,d.
3.4. Selective Deposition. It has been reported byVaeth and
Jensen53,54 that members of the poly-p-xylylene family, such as
parylene-N and parylene-C, can allow for substrate-dependent
deposition. However these coatings are non-functionalized, be-
cause they lack anchoring groups to support further covalent
immobilization.55 We have recently developed a reactive coating,
poly(4-vinyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene),52 whose formation can be
inhibited by titanium. To identify this candidate, 4 nonreactive
and 10 reactive poly(p-xylylenes) with a wide range of different
functional groups, such as amines, alcohols, aldehydes, anhy-
drides, active esters, alkyne, and ketones, were compared. The
CVD films were simultaneously deposited on a library of nine
differentmetal surfaces: Cu, Ir, Ta,W, Pt,Ni, Ti,Ag, andAu.The
presence of each polymer on the corresponding metal surface was
confirmed by using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy
(IRRAS). To confirm the selective deposition of poly(4-vinyl-p-
xylylene-co-p-xylylene) on titanium further, we purposely pre-
pared gold-patterned layers (that are non-inhibitory) on top of a
titanium surface. Then we used fluorescein-labeled methacrylates
via an olefin cross-metathesis reaction to verify the resulting
Figure 12. Selectively deposited poly(4-vinyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene). Polymer deposition occurs only in areas without the presence of
titanium metal. The fluorescence micrograph shows fluorescently labeled O-methacrylate that was used via the olefin cross-metathesis
reaction to confirm the reactivity of vinyl functional groups.52 (Reproduced from ref 52with permission. Copyright 2008Wiley-VCHVerlag

Abstract: We report that nanostructuring via dip-pen nanolithog-
raphy can be used for modification of a broad range of different
substrates (polystyrene, Teflon, stainless steel, glass, silicon,
rubber, etc.) without the need for reconfiguring the underlying
printing technology. This is made possible through the use of
vapor-based coatings that can be deposited on these substrates
with excellent conformity, while providing functional groups for
subsequent spatially directed click chemistry via dip-pen nano-
lithography. Pattern quality has been compared on six different
substrates demonstrating that this approach indeed results in a
surface modification protocol with potential use for a wide range
of biotechnological applications.
Substrates displaying controlled surface patterns with features
in the micrometer and nanometer regime have been of broad
scientific interest for technical and biomedical applications. Among
the available patterning methods, dip-pen nanolithography (DPN),
a scanning probe microscopy-based nanolithographic technique that
delivers “chemical inks” to substrates, offers a number of important
advantages, such as the ability to produce patterns with nanometer
resolution in a direct writing mode (no need for stamps and other
auxiliaries) and patterning of large surface areas by parallelizing
the writing process with 1D or 2D cantilever arrays.1-3 DPN is
also free of UV or ion-beam radiation and avoids harsh chemical
treatments compared to the uses of conventional photolithographic
methods.4 With optimized DPN process conditions, such as
homogeneous inking, the dwell time during the writing process,
temperature, and humidity,5,6 sub-50-nm resolution has been
reported.2,6 Inks such as organic molecules,1,3,7-11 alkylthiols,12
polymers,13-15 DNA,16,17 proteins,18-21 peptides,22,23 lipid
layer,24-26 metal ions,27,28 sols,29,30 and nanoparticles31,32 have
been processed in the past.2,4,6 Even some click chemistry ap-
proaches were reported recently.33,34 The potentially biggest
limitation of DPN is the limited number of substrates/ink combina-
tions that are compatible with the DPN process. Many of the more
common substrates in DPN, such as Au and Si, may be considered
model surfaces rather than biomedically or technically useful
materials.
We herein address this challenge by developing a more gener-
alizable surface modification protocol based on DPN on function-
alized poly-p-xylylene coatings. Functionalized poly-p-xylylenes
act as ReactiVe Coatings, which essentially establish interfaces
equipped with chemically reactive groups that can be selected from
amines, alcohols, aldehydes, activated carboxylic acids, alkynes,
and anhydrides.35-38 The coatings are deposited in a solventless
process by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization and
can be applied to a wide range of different substrate materials, if
they are stable under moderate vacuum.39 The CVD polymerization
process tends to maintain an unaltered substrate topology, provides
pinhole-free coverage even for sub-10-nm thick films, and can coat
complex geometries.40-42
Prior to DPN, a range of different substrate materials were coated
with poly(4-ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene), via CVD polym-
erization of 4-ethynyl[2.2]paracyclophane.38 Next, the ability of
these substrates to support DPN nanopatterning was confirmed via
spatially controlled Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. This reaction
involves ethynyl groups presented on the CVD coating, which
spontaneously convert with azides in the presence of a copper
catalyst. We selected this “click” reaction, because we expected
rapid conversion in high yields at room temperature to be critical
for the formation of patterns with sufficient quality.43 The coated
substrates were transferred into a DPN chamber, and a 1D cantilever
array containing 26 Si3N4 pens, which was first treated with oxygen
plasma to ensure proper wetting of the azide-containing ink, was
incubated in a solution of fluorescence-labeled azide ink (Figure
1). Successful Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition was confirmed
based on the formation of 1,2,3-triazoles44 that selectively formed
on poly(4-ethynyl-p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene) coatings, but not on
unfunctionalized poly-p-xylylene surfaces (Figure S4). The results
indicated efficient transfer of azide molecules to the surface (Figure
1c,e). During the printing step, tight control of humidity at 60%
was crucial in order to maintain the water meniscus and ensure the
delivery of azide molecules to the solid surfaces. We also examined
the dependence on writing speed vs fluorescence intensity in the
range 35 to 1.75 µm/s and found a decreased writing speed to result
in increased fluorescence intensity (see Supporting Information).
In addition, a nanoparticle pattern was created by first conducting
DPN writing of biotinylated azide molecules onto a poly(4-ethynyl-
p-xylylene-co-p-xylylene)-coated silicon substrate. Second, spatially
directed self-assembly of streptavidin-conjugated gold nanoparticles
resulted in patterns, which were analyzed by atomic force
microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1d). To demonstrate applicability to a
wide range of technically relevant substrates, DPN writing after
CVD polymerization was repeated on different substrates (Figure
