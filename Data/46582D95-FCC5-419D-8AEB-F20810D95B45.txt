本研究首先於含飽和水MTBE中藉由
CALB脂肪分解酵素，進行(R,S)-azolides之
水解動力分割。結果顯示當基質離去azole

Abstract: With hydrolysis of (R,S)-azolides
in water-saturated methyl tert-butyl ether
(MTBE) via Candida antarctica lipase B
(CALB) as the model system,
(R,S)-pyrazolides containing a leaving 3-, 4-
or 3,4-substituted-pyrazole moiety are
selected as the best substrates for preparing
various optically pure carboxylic acids
containing an α-chiral center. Great
improvements of enzyme activity for the
(R)-enantiomers with excellent
enantioselectivity (VR/VS > 100) are
obtainable, if (R,S)-pyrazolides containing a
leaving 3- or 3,4-substituted-pyrazole moiety
are employed for the hydrolysis or
alcoholysis by methanol in anhydrous MTBE.
A detailed kinetic analysis for
(R,S)-N-2-phenylpropionylpyrazoles
indicates that a bulky 3-substituent such as
3-(3-bromophenyl) or 3-(2-pyridyl) in the
leaving pyrazole moiety has profound effects
on decreasing the nucleophilic attack and
proton transfer of catalytic serine for the
slow-reacting enantiomer in anhydrous
MTBE, as well as that and substrate affinity
for both enantiomers in water-saturated
MTBE. The resolution platform is also
successfully applied to the hydrolysis of
(R,S)-pyrazolides in water-saturated
cyclohexane via Candida rugosa lipase
(Lipase MY) having opposite
enantioselectivity to CALB.

1. Introduction
Recently in order to rationalize the optimal
enantioselectivity of esterase or
lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of
(R,S)-2-substituted or (R,S)-3-substituted
carboxylic acid esters in the presence of an
organic solvent, a two-stage Brønsted slope
for the fast-reacting enantiomers and/or their
antipodes was determined, e.g. the kinetic
data on the right-hand side of Figure 1 for
(R,S)-2-phenylpropionic acid esters.[1] In the
preliminary results for the Candida
antarctica lipase B (CALB)-catalyzed
hydrolysis or alcoholysis of
(R,S)-N-profenylazoles in organic solvents,
(R,S)-N-profenyl-1,2,4-triazoles instead of
their corresponding ester analogs were
exploited as the best substrates for preparing
optically pure profens, i.e. 2-arylpropionic
acids or their ester..[1] If the rationale of
obtaining the improved enzyme performance
is valid for the (R,S)-azolides containing a
simple leaving azole, the question is then
how one can further stabilize the
enzyme-substrate complex for increasing the
4118 h by employing 60 mg/ml of CALB,
indicating that the lipase did not
accommodate (R)- and (S)-azolides of 4 and
14 containing a 5-substituent in the leaving
azole moiety.
In order to demonstrate the merit of using
(R,S)-azolides for preparing various
carboxylic acids containingan α-chiral center,
the α-methyl moiety of 1-14 was replaced by
α-ethyl moiety of 15 and 16. In comparison
with 480-fold enhancement of VR/(Et) with
excellent enantioselectivity for 16 containing
a leaving 1,2,4-triazole moiety, very low
reactivity of (R)-15 without detecting (S)-15
reactivity at 147.5 h was found. Apparently,
the α-ethyl moiety might impede the
substrate affinity to the active site, when
comparing VR/(Et) or VS/(Et) for 13 and 16,
and especially those for 10 and 15 containing
a bulky 3-(2-pyridyl) substituent in the
leaving pyrazole moiety. When the α-methyl
moiety was changed to α-methoxy of 17-19
containing a leaving 1,2,4-triazole,
4-bromopyrazole, or 3-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole
moiety, similar enzyme performances as
those for 10, 11, and 13 were observed,
except for giving very low enantioselectivity
for 18 and 19. This really indicates the
complicated interactions among the
substituent, α-methoxy moiety, and amino
acid residues mainly affecting VS/(Et) of
slow-reacting substrates. If the α-methyl
moiety was further replaced by α-bromo of
20-22 containing a leaving 3-methylpyrazole,
4-bromopyrazole, or 1,2,4-triazole moiety,
only 20 gave excellent enantioselectivity.
However, when employing
(R,S)-N-profenyl-4-bromopyrazoles of 23-25
as the substrate, increased enantioselectivity
with the penalty of slight deceasing of VR/(Et)
was perceived when comparing with the
previous results of using
(R,S)-N-profenyl-1,2,4-triazoles as the
substrate.[1]
All the results in Table 1 demonstrate that
a minute change of the α-substituent of acyl
part or leaving pyrazole moiety may greatly
affect CALB activity and enantioselectivity.
However, a guarantee of giving excellent
enantioselectivity may be made if
(R,S)-pyrazolides containing a leaving 3-, 4-
or 3,4-substituted-pyrazole moiety are
selected as the substrate. This is especially
true for 8, 10, and 17 containing a bulky
3-(2-pyridyl) or 3-(3-bromophenyl)
substituent. In order to improve the reactivity
of (R)-N-acylpyrazole containing a leaving 3,
4- or 3,4-substituented-pyrazole, the
hydrolytic resolution with water originally
adsorbed on CALB as the acyl acceptor was
carried out in anhydrous MTBE.
3.2. Kinetic analysis
The kinetic analysis based on
Michaelis-Menten mechanism was carried
out in anhydrous and water-saturated MTBE,
with which the kinetic constants represented
in Table 2 are then estimated and compared.[2]
In anhydrous MTBE, all Michaelis constants
KmR and KmS have the same
order-of-magnitude. This is also perceived
for all kinetic constants k2R but not k2S,
indicating that the leaving 1,2,4-triazole or
pyrazole moiety with or without containing a
substituent has minor influences on varying
the substrate affinity and nucleophilic attack
to the carbonyl carbon atom of
(R)-enantiomers but not their antipodes.
Therefore, one obtains the same
order-of-magnitude of k2R/KmR but not k2S/KmS,
leading to excellent enantioselectivity for 8
and 10, modest for 7 and 11, but low for 13.
Table 2 also demonstrates nearly the
same KmR and KmS for 7, 11 and 13 in
water-saturated MTBE, which are an
order-of-magnitude higher than those in
anhydrous MTBE. Very similar kinetic
behaviors giving almost the same k2R/KmR or
k2S/KmS and hence E values for 7 and 13 are
shown. In comparison with 7, about an
order-of-magnitude lower of k2R and k2R/KmR
(or k2S and k2S/KmS), and then higher E value
(i.e. k2RKmS/k2SKmR), for 11 containing a
leaving 4-bromopyrazole moiety are
obtainable. This indicates that water adsorbed
in the active site has decreased the
nucleophilic attack and proton transfer of
catalytic serine but not the substrate affinity,
and hence the reactivity of (R)- and (S)-11.
