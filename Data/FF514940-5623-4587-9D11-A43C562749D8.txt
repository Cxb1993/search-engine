Abstract 
In many studies, NSAIDs detected to present in the effluent of wastewater 
treatment plants, and even have been detected in lakes, groundwater, and drinking 
water. As yet, especial pharmaceuticals at trace levels in aquatic environment have 
been confirmed that they have been discovered the potential impact on human health 
and aquatic environment. By means of ozone and advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs) technologies can enhance pharmaceuticals degradation.  
The objective of this study is to evaluate significant effect on different operation 
conditions degradability of NASIDs in water by O3, and O3 /UV process. Further, the 
study also focuses on significant effect of ozonation by products formation and 
prediction kinetics model in different operation processes. In conclusion, this study 
may be importance in explaining the relationship between NASIDs degradation and 
assumed different operation conditions. Finally, may determine the appropriate 
method for solving pharmaceuticals problems in aquatic environment. 
 
1. Introduction   
In recent years, many researches have been conducted pertaining to the 
characteristics and the environmental and health effects of the residuals of the 
pharmaceutical drugs and Personal Care Products (PPCPs) existing in aquatic 
environment. PPCPs consist of various classes such as non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), antibiotics, antiepileptics, etc. NSAIDs have been 
widely used and, in some occasion, abused by humans and animals due to their highly 
pain killing properties. In many studies, NSAIDs were detected in the effluent of the 
wastewater treatment plants, as well as in lakes, groundwater, and drinking water. 
Although pharmaceuticals were detected at trace levels in the aquatic environment, 
They have been confirmed causing potential impact on human health and aquatic 
environment. Most of the PPCPs are not degradable in the conventional wastewater 
treatment processes or the aquatic environment, a large number of past studies have 
focused on finding effective treatment technologies in removing NASIDs in aquatic 
environment. The treatment technologies investigated for removing NSAIDs include 
ozonation, heterogeneous photocatalysis, Fenton, sonolysis, UV/H2O2, wet air 
oxidation, and electrolysis. 
Among these treatment technologies, ozonation and advanced oxidation 
processes (AOPs) were found to be effective in removing NSAIDs. (Esplugas et al., 
2007; Klavarioti et al., 2009; Zwiener and Frimmel, 2000).  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the degradation of mefenamic acid (MEF) 
in water by O3 and O3/UV processes under various operational conditions. Mefenamic 
acid (MEF) is a prevailing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) drug.

meter. 
 
The experiment carried out in a bench scale ozone reactor containing a mixer. 
The reactor was equipped with a water jacket to maintain a persistent temperature.  
The gaseous or dissolved ozone was generated with ozone generator (Sumitomo, 
Tokyo, Japan) through a diffuser for the ozonation process at 25 
o
C. The gaseous and 
dissolved ozone concentration were measured by the KI absorption and indigo blue 
methods following the Standard Method 2350 E and 4500-O3 (APHA, 2005), 
respectively. In addition, irradiation experiments were carried out in an annular 
reactor (4L) thermostated at 25 ℃ and equipped with a 16W low-pressure mercury 
monochromatic lamp emitting at 254nm. 
The purpose of the ozonation process was to evaluate the effect of ozonation on 
removal of MEF. In addition, ozonation by-products were investigated, such as 
aldehyde and ketone formation in the ozonation process.

different applications in O3 and O3/UV processes to compare the reactions. 
Photocatalytic ozonation is a novel AOPs approving high removal of organic carbon 
by combining the favorable effects of ozonation with the generation of hydroxyl 
radicals (Agustina et al., 2005). Figure 2 shows the effect of UV light on the 
degradation of MEF during ozoantion at various pH values level. The result illustrate 
that can enhance the removal efficiency of MEF in O3/UV process than ozoantion.    
According to Hoigne  ´ and Bader study (1983), the direct reactivity of 
non-protonated organic amine species with ozone is higher than the protonated ones. 
Thus, it seems distinct that pH variation can affect not only direct ozonation but also 
free radical oxidation of MEF. However, free radical oxidation can be considered 
negligible in ozone processes at pH lower than 4. 
In Fig. 2, ozonation at low dose 0.7 mg L
-1
 could slightly reduce the MEF 
degradation; whereas, the degradation of MEF in O3/UV process was higher than that 
on ozonation of synthetic water, thereby leading to the removal of higher MEF 
concentration after O3/UV process in 10 min. Therefore, the reduction of MEF in the 
O3/UV process can distantly enhance removal efficiently. Additionally, the results 
(Figs. 2b and 2c) were similar to that of degradation as discussed above. However, 
Figure 2(b-c) show the removal efficiency of MEF that was found to be over 80% in 
the O3/UV process than ozonation at pHs 7 and 9, which suggests that the higher 
hydroxyl radical formation (O3/UV) could effectively reduce the MEF concentration.

3.4 Formation of Ozoantion By-Products 
In general, the formations of the typical ozonation by-products include aldehydes 
carboxylic acids, and ketones (Richardson et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2005). Because 
ozonation by-products such as aldehyde and ketone were harmful to human, are more 
concerned and researched. However, it is important to clarify by-products formation 
of organic compounds during ozonation. In this study, ozonation by-products 
consisting of aldehydes were studied. Figure 4 shows the formation of the ozonation 
by-products for MEF at different levels of pH in the ozonation and O3/UV process. In 
the study, the principal aldehydes are formaldehye and acetaldehyde, especially at 
high pH. According to Chang et al. (2007) study, indicated that the formation suggests 
that hydroxyl radical (formed at pH 9) could destroy organic compound and generate 
shorter chain by-products such as formaldehyde than ozone molecule (formed at pH 
5). However, a further increase the formations of the ozonation by-products in applied 
to O3/UV process, significantly. Because the reaction could generate more OH 
radicals in the O3/UV process than ozonation. Therefore, higher extent of the 
formation of aldehydes during O3/UV process, were observed.

Abstract 
In many studies, NSAIDs detected to present in the effluent of wastewater 
treatment plants, and even have been detected in lakes, groundwater, and drinking 
water. As yet, especial pharmaceuticals at trace levels in aquatic environment have 
been confirmed that they have been discovered the potential impact on human health 
and aquatic environment. By means of ozone and advanced oxidation processes 
(AOPs) technologies can enhance pharmaceuticals degradation.  
The objective of this study is to evaluate significant effect on different operation 
conditions degradability of NASIDs in water by O3. Further, the study also focuses on 
significant effect of ozonation intermediate formation and develop kinetic constants to 
assess kinetics model in different operation processes. In conclusion, ozonation was 
proved to be an appropriate method to remove diclofenac acid in water. The TOC 
removal was basically enhanced with the increasing ozone dosage and was affected 
by the pH values, while the degradation of diclofenac was also affected by the ozone 
dosage but little by the pH value in the semi-batch reactor. The kinetic constants 
leaded to a fast reaction and made the kinetic model further improved. The reaction of 
diclofenac was supposed to undergo distinctive routes to release chloride, amino 
group, and other products. The ozone direct attack would probably prefer to break 
C-N cleavage, and the OH radical would prefer to add on the ipso-site due to the 
nucleophilic amino group. 
 
1.  Introduction   
Many resent studies have focused on the large quantities of pharmaceutical and 
personal care products (PPCPs) presented in the aquatic environment. These 
compounds have been identified and investigated due to their potential impacts on 
human health and environment. The group of PPCPs is classified as antibiotics, 
estrogens, beta-blockers, lipid regulators, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). These drugs have been widely used and sometimes remain and excrete 
through human body after oral administration. Among the PPCPs, NSAIDs are most 
frequently detected as both unmetabolized and active metabolites except for original 
forms and enter the ecosystem, including the surface water, groundwater, and the 
effluent of wastewater treatment plants. 
Diclofenac is one of the NSAIDs, and commonly prescribed as pain-killers. In 
Taiwan, the amount of usage of diclofenac has been repoted as thousands tons of 
kilogram annually (NHI 2004 usage survey project). In the effluent of conventional 
waterwater treatment plants, the removal efficiency of diclofenac is barely useful 
(Joss et al, 2006). Therefore, diclofenac and its parent compounds enter the ecosystem 
16 
 
chemicals and solvents were supplied at HPLC grade and were used as received. 
Milli-Q water was used in all the experiments and analytical procedures. 
Diclofenac solutions were prepared as 10 mg/L and 70 mg/L for the tests of 
efficiencies in multiple operational conditions and the identification of intermediates 
during ozonation respectively. Phosphate buffers were used to maintain stable pH 
values at 0.05M.    
2.2 Establish Analytical Method 
The consumption of diclofenac was measured by HPLC with UV detector. For 
analysis of diclofenac, a C-18 column (Varian, 250x4.6mm) was equipped and the 
detection wavelength was set at 280nm. The flow rate was 1.25mL/min, and the 
mobile phase was consisted of 50% ammonium formate (10mM) and 50% acetonitrile. 
(Coelho et al., 2009) 
The concentrations of chloride were determined by ion chromatography 
(Metrohm 790 personal IC; Metrosep A Supp 4-250 column; 1.8 mM Na2CO3/1.7 
mM NaHCO3 eluent; 1 mL/min eluent flow rate). Total organic carbon (TOC) was 
determined by a total organic carbon analyzer (O.I. Corporation, Model 700). 
The identification and production of intermediates during ozonation of 
diclofenac were determined by GC-MS, consisted of an HP 7890 series gas 
chromatograph and an HP 5973 selective mass detector (Agilent Technologies). The 
samples need to be treated by solid-phase extraction prior to analysis. The cartridges 
made up by Oasis HLB were conditioned with 2mL of methanol, deionized water, 
0.1N HCl, and water. After the conditioning step, 50mL water samples were loaded 
and eluted with 2mL of methanol. The eluates were evaporated by nitrogen stream 
and recomposed to a final volume of 0.1ml. Separation in GC-MS was carried out 
after 10 µL the samples were injected into the capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 
0.25 µm VF-5ms, Agilent, USA). The temperature program was: initial 105 
o
C for 1 
min, then rising to 180 
o
C at 25 C
o
/min a, and finally rising 250 
o
C at 5 C
o
/min 
standing for I min. The spilt-splitless injector was operated as initial pressure 30 psi 
standing for 1.5 min and the spilt flow was 50mL/min. (Prez-Estrada et al, 2005) 
2.3 Ozonation and Advanced Oxidation Process 
 
As shown in Figure 2-1. The bench scale batch or semi-batch ozonation 
processes were used in the experiment.  
18 
 
solution measured with time. As the diclofenac was barely detected by HPLC, the 
ozone dose in the liquid phase started to increase. 
Figure 1 (b) stated the TOC removal rate of ozonation of diclofenac at the three 
different ozone doses and without adjusting pH values via phosphate buffer. The TOC 
removal was 41.59%, 32%, and 33.74% in the decreasing level of ozone doses. This 
result indicated that the disappearance of diclofenac did not represent the level of 
minerization. The remaining TOC might contain the ozone by-products and other 
intermediates. Furthermore, the result also inferred the TOC removal showed little 
relationship with the ozone dose.  
Figure 1 (c) presented the concentration of chloride formed during the reaction time 
of one hour. The chloride was released consistently to the highest concentration about 
2.2 ppm in the first 20 and 25 min at the higher two ozone doses respectively, and 
then the concentration of chloride balanced or slightly decreased with the last 40 and 
35 min respectively. The performance of chloride might be concluded by the 
excessive ozone doses which oxidized the chloride to form chlorite. For the lowest 
ozone dose, the chloride kept formed in the whole process, the concentration of 
chloride in the end of reaction was about 0.74 ppm, and the trend of time was likely 
performed as a linear function. The result implied the chlorination was affected by the 
ozone doses, and it probably might not be the major part in the ozonation of 
diclofenac.  
 
 
20 
 
performances of diclofenac when the ozone consistently provided.  
The TOC removal at fixed pH values was shown in figure 2 (b) and 3 (b) 
respectively. For the higher ozone dose, the TOC removal rates were 43.6%, 44.46%, 
and 35.18% at pH values 5.5, 7.4, and 8.9 respectively. The results inferred the 
presence of phosphate buffer might increase the TOC removal instead of inhibitor, but 
for the higher pH value, phosphate buffer would likely make an effect on generating 
less OH radicals. Figure 3 (b) reported the TOC removal rates at three different fixed 
pH values, and the rates were 25.97%, 28.81%, and 25.41% at pH values 5.5, 7.4, and 
8.9 respectively. The results indicted the phosphate buffer played an inhibitor role, 
and the pH values could barely affect the TOC removal.

at different levels of pH values at the same ozone dosage. ([O3]/[DCF]=9.3)

3.3 Calculation of kinetic constants 
According to many studies (Vogna et al, 2004; Coelho et al, 2009; Sein et al, 
2008), the method of developing kinetic constants was competition method. Due to 
the discrepancy of the reported values of ozone rate constant, the redetermination 
established by an independent method was important. However, the reagent used in 
competition method was phenol or other organic compounds, which might cause 
potential impact on environment. Therefore, another calculation done by the 
following assumption and equation was developed. 
In semi-batch reactor, the ozone concentration could be seen as a constant 
because it was consistently injected into reactor. Thus, the second order reaction could 
become a pseudo-first order reaction. Along with the concentration of diclofenac 
varied with time, and the assumption of fast adsorption of ozone in the solution, the 
kinetic constants could be developed and shown in table 2.

(0.46). Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is an antibiotic used for eliminating bacteria and 
infectious diseases, which is much more hydrophobic according to its low solubility 
in water (610 mg L
-1
) and higher log Kow value (0.89). On the other hand, DCF is the 
larger compound with larger molecular weight of 296.15 and molecular size of 
7.2–9.37 nm as compared to ACAP and SMX, which may result in a larger Van der 
Waals force between model compound and adsorbent. Many researches have reported 
the adsorption behaviors of DCF (Bui and Choi, 2009; Carvalho et al. 2011; Hu et al., 
2011; Krajišnik et al., 2011; Scheytt et al., 2005; Ternes et al., 2002; Xiong et al., 
2010; Xu et al., 2009), ACAP (Cabrita et al., 2010; Cotoruelo et al., 2011; Hoegberg 
et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2006) and SMX 
(Akhtar et al., 2011; Ç ahşkan and Göktürka, 2010; Fukahori et al., 2011; Vergili and 
Barlas, 2009; Yang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2009) on various adsorbents. Besides, these 
pharmaceuticals have been frequently detected in wastewater and river frequently, and 
therefore were the target compounds in this study.  
Activated carbon adsorption process has been used widely for the removal of 
PPCP, natural organic matter (NOM) and volatile organic chemicals (VOC) (Redding 
et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2005; Yoon et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2009; Sulaymon et al., 
2009) due to its higher porosity and large specific surface area (pore volume 0.33-1.5 
cm
3
 g
-1
). By particle size, activated carbon can be divided into powered (PAC) and 
granular activated carbon (GAC). PAC was referred has been used to particle diameter 
less than 300 mesh. However, it is more difficult to regenerate PAC than GAC. 
Generally, activated carbon process was in the tertial treatment for adsorbing 
refractory organics and organic precursors for disinfection by products (DBP) 
(Kulkarni et al., 2010). The constants of adsorption isotherms were used to predict the 
adsorption capacity over time at the equilibrium. 
The objective of this present work is to investigate the adsorption characteristics 
of selected PPCPs onto GAC and evaluate the adsorption models under 
non-competitive and competitive adsorption conditions. The batch adsorption 
experiments were conducted for the simultaneous aqueous adsorption of DCF, ACAP 
and SMX. The experimental data were analyzed with external diffusion model for 
diffusion based kinetic study, while reaction based kinetic was studied by applying 
pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order equation models. The effect of GAC 
particle size was also studied. The adsorption isotherms were developed for single and 
multi-component conditions. Langmuir and Freundlich models were applied to 
express the single component adsorption isotherms. The equilibrium adsorption 
isotherm proposed for single component system have been extended and modified to 
represent the binary and ternary adsorption equilibrium. Therefore, the parameters of 
single component adsorption isotherm models are necessary in order to fit the data for 
the multi-component isotherms models.

and then desiccated at 178K for 24 h. The GAC was crashed and sieved through 
various sieves with different size (60, 80, 120, 230, and 320 mesh) to get average size 
of 0.271, 0.158, 0.073, 0.038 and 0.028 mm. The physico-chemical properties of

3.1 Kinetic models 
Adsorption kinetics describes the rate of adsorption which controls the residence 
time of adsorbate at the solid-liquid interface (Dizge et al., 2009). The adsorption 
kinetic was analyzed with the external diffusion model for diffusion-based kinetics 
(Eq. (2)-(4)) (Valdereama et al., 2008). 
In the homogeneous particle diffusion model (HPDM), adsorbate diffused 
through the liquid film from the solution phase to the particle surface, and there were 
several resistances to adsorb compounds by adsorbents. When the diffusion rate 
controlled adsorption on spherical particles, the following expression was used:

If 0＜x(t)＜1, the Eq. (2) could be simplified as Eq. (3), and Eq. (3) could be 
simplified to Eq. (4), which covered most of the experiment data for calculating 
effective diffusion coefficient (Valdereama et al., 2008).

adsorption experiments, such as adsorption parameters and adsorption capacity. There 
are two isotherm models used to calculate the adsorption parameters by using the 
experimental data for the Langmuir and Freundlich models.

4. Results and discussion 
In this study, the adsorption characteristics of selected pharmaceuticals on GAC 
adsorption were investigated under non-competitive and competitive conditions in 
batch experiments. The influence of a solution containing multiple components on the 
adsorption process depends on the physico-chemical properties of the adsorbate and 
the adsorbent as well as the operation conditions such as pH, Kow, and initial solute 
concentration (Dizge and Tansel, 2011). 
4-1 Effect of Particle Size 
The slope of early adsorption stage (0-0.5 h) in each compound was used to 
estimate the effective diffusion coefficient by Eq. (4) which is a linearized form of Eq. 
(2). Figure 1 displays the time-dependence adsorption of DCF, ACAP and SMX onto 
GAC with various particle sizes. It is observed that the adsorption capacity is slightly 
influenced by particle size of GAC, which may result from the slightly difference of 
pore volume in GAC of different particle sizes. The adsorption capacity at equilibrium 
was 1.53, 2.91 and 1.81 mmol g
-1
 for DCF, ACAP and SMX. Obviously, the 
adsorption capacity increased with the decrease of molecular weight and size. For 
GAC of each particle size, ACAP presents higher adsorption capacity, while DCF 
reveals lower adsorption capacity among these compounds. It is the reason of 
molecule dimensions such as molecular weight and molecular size. Generally, the 
micropores contribute with the larger fraction of surface area and pore volume, which 
determine the adsorption capacity to a certain extent. However, during adsorption of 
larger adsorbates, the access to the micropores of adsorbent is limited (Bu et al., 2011). 
Therefore, ACAP with smaller molecular size exhibits higher adsorption capacity, and 
DCF presents a lower adsorption capacity due to larger molecular size.  
The effective diffusion coefficient was obtained from the average of the particle 
sizes. As listed in Table 1, the effective diffusion coefficient was 3.32×10
-9
, 5.73×10
-9
 
and 6.89×10
-9
 (cm
2
 s
-1
) for DCF, ACAP and SMX, respectively. The results showed 
that the effective diffusion coefficient increased when the particle size increased. On 
the other hand, initial concentration was also the main factor to effective diffusion 
coefficient. The diffusivity and mass transfer increased when initial concentration 
increased (Serarols et al., 2001). The smaller effective diffusion coefficient for DCF 
indicated that the rate of adsorption might be smaller than other target compounds in 
binary system and it meant that the adsorbent might first adsorb the compound in 
competition with DCF initially and desorbed it finally. Granular activated carbon was

in this study was controlled by chemisorption (Dizge et al., 2009). Figure 2 displays 
the experimental data fitted by the pseudo-second order kinetic equation. Obviously, 
the experimental data were in agreement with the predictive values. Besides, the 
kinetic rate constants follows the sequence of ACAP > SMX > DCF, which is 
consistent with the order of molecular size.

4-2-2 Adsorption Isotherm 
The equilibrium adsorption isotherm of target compounds for GAC was analyzed 
by the Langmuir isotherm models as showed in Eq. (7). Figure 3 presents the 
equilibrium adsorption capacity of target compounds for GAC. It was interesting to 
know that the equilibrium adsorption capacity of GAC at lower adsorbate 
concentration followed the sequence of DCF > SMX > ACAP but the trend was the 
opposite at higher concentrations. Some factors were used to evaluate the behavior 
including molecular size of target compounds and porous volume and iodine number 
of GAC. It has been studied that the iodine number of adsorbent larger than 500 mg 
g
-1
 was favorable for adsorbing low molecular weight compounds (El-Hendawy et al., 
2001). The GAC dosage was held constant in the experiments which indicated that the 
amount the porous volume was also kept constant. Therefore, when the concentration 
increased, the pores adsorbed the molecules until they fouled the pore on the surface 
of particle. ACAP and SMX were dominant because of the smaller molecular size. 
Hence, the trend at higher concentration was determined due to the larger molecular

4-3 Multi-Component System 
In the multi-component system, the adsorption behavior of the adsorbates could 
be classified into non-competitive adsorption and competitive adsorption according to 
the selective nature of the adsorption sites for a particular adsorbate. There are several 
models for calculating the equilibrium adsorption capacity of a multi-component 
adsorption system which can be used to predict the adsorption capacity of a multiple 
system under various experimental conditions. Therefore, the experimental data have 
been fitted to the multi-component isotherm models for determining the predicted 
adsorption capacity, viz., non-competitive and competitive adsorption isotherm 
models. The comparisons of the experimental and calculated equilibrium adsorption 
capacity (qe) values for the three model compounds onto GAC are also presented in 
the parity plots of Figure 4.  
The non-competitive adsorption description that there are the selective natures of 
the adsorption sites for adsorbate indicating that there are no interference between 
adsorbates in the multi-component system. As shown in Figure 4a, the calculated 
values (by Eq. (9)) were all smaller than the experimental values, and the values of 
average relative error (ARE, derived from Eq. (12)) were all over 19% even to 40%, 
indicating that the multi-component non-competitive model related the individual 
isotherm parameters could not be used to predict the binary system adsorption. 
The multi-component non-modified Langmuir model (as derived from Eq. (11)) 
has been conducted to predict the competitive adsorption behavior. Most of the data 
points are distributed around the 45° line, indicating that the non-modified Langmuir 
model represents well the experimental data. 
In comparison with the non-competitive model, the multi-component Langmuir 
model fitted reasonably well the binary system in the selected concentration range, 
although there were some slightly deviation observed between the experimental and 
calculated results from this model. In addition to ACAP in the presence of SMX, most 
of the ARE values were smaller than 15 even to 1.2, which were 14.88 and 6.98 for 
the binary system of ACAP and DCF; 15.40 and 7.29 for the binary system of SMX 
and DCF; 82.69 and 1.20 for the binary system of ACAP and SMX, respectively. 
Figure 5 displays the competitive effect on adsorption capacity between the 
target compounds in the binary component solutions for GAC. Figures 5a and 5c 
present that competitive adsorption of a binary system for ACAP, DCF and SMX, it 
was found that ACAP was the least favorable compound in the competitive adsorption. 
Even though the iodine number of GAC suggests that ACAP is a favorable compound, 
however, the small value of Freundlich constant n of ACAP among these target 
compounds caused it the least favorable compound in the competitive adsorption. 
There were indefinite vibrations on the curve of the adsorption capacity. The 
47 
 
compound which is ACAP or SMX made an insignificant interference to DCF no 
matter as shown in Figure 7a. Figure 7b shows that there was an obvious difference 
between single and multi- component solutions indicating that the existence of the 
other compound was an apparent interference to ACAP in competitive adsorption. 
Figure 7c showed that there was a difference between single and binary (SMX and 
ACAP) systems, and there was also another difference between binary systems 
indicating that DCF and ACAP were the factors of interference with SMX in 
competitive adsorption and DCF had a larger interference to SMX than ACAP.
