TIME-HISTORY ANALYSIS 
 
Roof Acceleration Analysis 
 
A time-history analysis was performed on the National Center for Research on Earthquake 
Engineering Administration Building in Taipei (see Fig. 2). The building is a six-story concrete 
structure with a single-level basement, and the lateral-load-resisting system is classified as moment-
resisting frame with nonstructural partition and perimeter walls constructed of concrete. Acceleration 
responses parallel and perpendicular to the entrance of the building (say, the x- and y-directions 
respectively) are monitored by accelerometers installed in the basement, the ground, the third, and the 
sixth floors. Instrumentation layout on the ground and the sixth floors are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. 
 
verify the influence of rigid-body motion, a comparison was made between the roof and ground 
accelerations, both CWB records, as given in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the roof acceleration are 
almost in phase with the ground accelerations only with amplitudes magnified, which means that as 
long as the structural model is rigid enough, the roof acceleration obtained from the analysis cannot be 
far off. 
 
As mentioned above, comparison between floor accelerations does not make a clear distinction 
between good and mediocre structural models for rigid structures. Besides, these data cannot be 
converted into design parameters directly. Therefore, a more engineering-oriented study was also 
carried out.

Building Deformation Analysis 
 
Baseline Correction and Data Screening 
 
In seismic design, the integrity of a building depends on the strength and deformability (or ductility) of 
the structure. Since the earthquake load a building experiences is mainly determined by its lateral 
deformation, the accuracy of deformation calculation is critical to the safely of a building. 
Theoretically, the deformation of a building at each floor can be calculated by subtracting ground 
displacement from the floor displacement, both of which can be obtained by integrating the 
acceleration twice at respective locations. However, inherent imperfections such as instrument error, 
baseline offset, and electronic noises tend to introduce accumulative errors into these integrations. 
Therefore, correction measures have to be applied during the above integration process. 
 
According to the procedure recommended by Shakal et al. (2003), at least a first order baseline 
correction should be performed on the raw data collected by the sensors. If applicable, simple 
correction using a constant or linear pattern is most effective when a large number of records are 
involved. More complicated measure may also be considered for particular records. In this study, 
baseline correction of the CWB acceleration data was handled using the least-square method. These 
accelerations were then integrated to get corresponding velocities. Figs. 11 and 12 show the absolute 
velocities at the ground and roof levels, respectively, obtained from the acceleration records collected 
during the Chi Chi Earthquake. It can be seen that there is a sudden change of slope in both curves 
right before t = 21 sec., which implies a step-type jump in the accelerographs. Since similar changes 
are observed in all records at almost the same time, the opportunity of instrument errors seem unlikely. 
A more possible reason could be pounding between the Administration Building and the Laboratory, 
which are merely separated by a 12 in. joint, during the Earthquake. As current baseline correction 
techniques are not effective in eliminating this type of signal distortion, only the data occurring after t 
= 21 sec. were used in the following analysis. Such discard of early-stage data should not affect the 
conclusions of this investigation considering that the acceleration values are relative small. A similar 
process was performed on the acceleration data collected during the first 20 sec. of the Chiayi 
Earthquake. 
 
Restoration of Relative Displacement 
 
Even after the above process, the displacement obtained from integration of the velocity history still 
shows accumulative errors. These errors could be minimized by (high- and low-frequency) filtering of 
the recorded data, which involves determination of the cut-off frequencies for each individual record. 
The procedure would require intensive calculations and knowledge in signal processing, which is often 
lacked among structural engineers. Since the purpose of this study is to obtain the deformation 
information of the structure, i.e., the relative displacement between the roof and the ground, an 
alternative approach was employed. According to dynamic principles, a structure deformed under 
vibration is expected to pass through its neutral position during a complete deformation cycle (or 
fundamental period) except for few cases. Therefore, the relative displacement between the roof and

CONCLUSIONS 
 
The roof deformations of the NCREE Administration Building during the 1999 Chi Chi and Chiayi 
Earthquakes were calculated based on both direct integration of CWB acceleration records and 
dynamic structural analysis. Comparison between results obtained from these two approaches shows 
agreements on both timing and values of maximum roof deformations, which means that a well-
performed structural analysis should be able to correctly estimate the maximum deformations of a 
building during an earthquake. With deformation calculation justified, engineers can now maintain a 
higher level of confidence in the result of structural analysis. However, it should be noted that the 
structural responses involved in this study are in the linear range. To estimate the nonlinear responses 
of a structure, further investigations will be necessary. 
 
A method to calculate building deformations by integrating acceleration data collected during 
earthquakes was also developed in this study. It was shown that this approach is able to provide 
reasonable results with minimal calculations. With this new technique, researcher will be able to 
obtain deformation information of buildings without complicated structural analysis, which will be 
quite useful for both the authority and insurance agencies for earthquake damage assessment.

Dynamic Analysis of Structures with Reinforced Concrete Walls 
 
Yu-Chi Sung1, Chao Hsun Huang2, and Chin-Kuo Su3 
 
Abstract: This paper presents a modeling technique for nonlinear dynamic analysis of 
structures with reinforced concrete shear walls. In this approach, concrete walls are modeled 
as a pair of diagonal struts, which resist most the shear force acting on the structure, and 
boundary elements, which act like regular frame members. To simulate the structural 
behavior of the concrete walls, a softened truss model was used to obtain the 
force-displacement relationship of the struts; for boundary elements, on the other hand, the 
force-deformation relationship were generated through a computer program NARC-2004. 
These models were then implemented in the seven-story structure designated by the Blind 
Prediction Contest for subsequent analysis. Details on both theoretical formulation and 
results of the analysis will be described in this paper.

where d is the effective depth of the column, s is the spacing of shear reinforcement, fy is the 
yield strength of the reinforcement, and Av is the area of shear reinforcement within a 
distance s. The shear strength provided by the concrete, on the other hand, may decrease 
significantly as flexural deformation of the column increases, particularly in the hinge area.
