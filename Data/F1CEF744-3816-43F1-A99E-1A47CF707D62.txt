device, but passengers ride in the bus have WiFi enable devices instead of UMTS enable
devices. To provide passengers who have WiFi enable devices IMS-based ITS services,
we propose an IMS shared access solution for APTS. In the proposed solution, a bus
has a router equipped with both UMTS and WiFi network interfaces, called UW-Router.
Passengers can connect with the UW-Router by WiFi. Then, UW-Router can share its
IMS access to passengers for IMS-based ITS services.
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews
UMTS architecture and related works. Section 3 presents how the proposed solution
works in detail. Finally, Section 4 has the conclusion remarks.
2 Background and Related Works
This Section reviews a simple UMTS architecture, the IMS registration and the 3GPP
generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA).
2.1 3GPP Architecture
Figure 1 illustrates the basic components and important reference points for IMS in the
UMTS architecture [1, 6], which are briefly presented as follows:
• UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) contains Radio Network Con-
trollers (RNC) and base stations (Node B). The UTRAN allows connectivity be-
tween UE and the core network.
• Packet-switch domain, which is located in the core network, contains (i) Gateway

confirming the identity of UE and protecting SIP messages [11]. In contrast with 3GPP
AKA, UE must keep RES secret in IMS AKA. The IMS AKA illustrated in Figure 2 can
be decomposed in the following steps:
Step I1. UE sends a SIP Register message with IMPI to P-CSCF through SGSN. Then,
P-CSCF forwards the request to I-CSCF.
Step I2 and I3. I-CSCF exchanges the User Authorization Request (UAR) and User
Authorization Answer (UAA) pair with HSS over Cx reference to obtain the name
of the S-CSSF that is serving UE.
Step I4. I-CSCF identifies the S-CSCF address and then forwards the Register message
to the S-CSCF.
Step I5. If S-CSCF does not have a valid authentication vector (AV ) array for UE,
S-CSCF sends a Multimedia Authentication Request (MAR) over Cx reference to
HSS for obtaining an AV array. Otherwise, this Step and Step I6 can be skipped.
Note that an AV contains (i) a random number RAND, (ii) an expected response

Figure 3: The GBA basic architecture.
2.3 3GPP Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA)
The 3GPP GBA is defined for application security, which goal is to authenticate the
subscriber and establish a shared secret between the subscriber and service provider using
3GPP AKA-based protocol. In Figure 3, two specified components are presented: (i)
Bootstrap Server Function (BSF) is in charge of acquiring subscription information for
UEs from HSS using the diameter protocol and invoking bootstrap to achieve UMTS AKA
protocol with UEs. (ii) Network Application Function (NAF) can run some application-
specific protocol with NAF.
When UE will execute some application protocols with NAF, for the authentication
purpose and for securing the communication path between UE and the NAF, UE and
NAF must have a shared secret key between both. Therefore, UE and BSF must raise
the GBA bootstrapping authentication procedure, which is carried out by the HTTP
digest AKA protocol [16] to mutually authenticate and then agree on secret keys that are
afterwards applied between UE and NAF. After the bootstrap has been completed, the
NAF can acquire the agreed secret key from BSF using the diameter protocol. Then, the
UE and the NAF can securely run some application specific protocols based on the secret
key generated during the bootstrap. If the bootstrap has been performed and the lifetime
of the secret key is not expired, the bootstrap can be omitted.
3 The IMS shared access solution
To hide the complexity of offering value-added services, intelligent transport services are
developed on IMS. However, in terms of intelligent public transport system, e.g., bus,
passengers’ devices may be WiFi enable device, but not be UMTS enable device, which

Step U1 to U4. If the PD has a list of NAF information with NAF Key Centre func-
tionality, it immediately proceeds with Step U4. Otherwise, the PD needs to send
a request to the UW-Router for acquiring a list of available NAF information with
NAF Key Centre functionality. After that, the PD selects a IDNAF with NAF Key
Centre functionality from the list acquired from Step U2. Then, the PD sends a
request with IDNAF to the UW-Router for a B − TID.
Step U5, U6 and U7. If no valid B − TID, the UW-Router raises a new GBA boot-
strapping procedure. After the GBA bootstrapping procedure completed, the UW-
Router acquire B-TID from the BSF and a key Ks ext NAF and the associated key
lifetime from UICC. After that, UW-Router sends a response with the B − TID
8
If not, the UW-Router terminates the key agreement procedure and returns a
verification failure message. Otherwise, UW-Router derives key KsPD from the
Ks (ext) NAF, B − TID, IDNAF and IDPD as Equation 3.1. Beside, the UW-
Router then responses to the PD a ”verification successful” message.
Step U19 The PD and UW-Router use the key KsPD as the pairwise master key (PMK)
in IEEE 802.11i [14] to perform the four-way handshake.
3.2 IMS registration for shared access
IP multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIM) in UICC contains the collection of pa-
rameters that are used for IMS subscriber identification, authentication and terminal
configuration. Two types of critical identity, which are (1) IMPI, which is the only one
private user identity allocated to the IMS subscriber in UICC, and (2) IMPU, which
public user identity, has one or more identities allocated to the subscriber. Therefore,
such multiple IMPU can be shared with difference passengers. However, the subscriber
needs to pass both the 3GPP AKA and IMS authentication/registration using IMPI and
the specified IMPU allocated in UICC for itself. The passengers need to raise the IMS
registration procedure with other IMPU via the help of the subscriber. Therefore, Be-
fore providing IMS shared access to passengers, UW-Router must pass the 3GPP AKA
and IMS authentication/registration using IMPI and IMPUUW−Router in S-CSCF, where
IMPUUW−Router is the specified service profile identity for UW-Router. Subsequently, the
PD can use the GBA-based WiFi association procedure to establish WiFi association with
UW-Router, and then the PD can raise IMS authentication/registration procedure with
the corresponding S-CSCF via UW-Router using a temporary IMPUPD. After that the
PD can access IMS-based ITS services with the help of UW-Router using the registed
IMPUPD.
