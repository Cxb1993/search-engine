2. Introduction
Taiwan, located on the Circum-Pacific
seismic belt, has very high seismicity. For the
buildings in Taiwan, the seismic pounding of
adjacent buildings may pose a potentially
serious problem since past building codes did
not provide definite guidelines on the
building separation and a maximum land use
is often required due to high population
density and economic considerations.
The 1982 TBC required all new
constructions to have a seismic separation
between adjacent buildings to avoid
pounding. The seismic pounding provisions
in the 1997 TBC has important modifications
with respect to previous versions. However,
the research results (Lin and Weng, 2002)
reveal that, due to the lack of proper
treatment of the vibration phases of adjacent
buildings, the method used in the current
TBC provides poor estimates for the required
building separation distance and produces a
non-uniform risk for all the cases
investigated. The combination method of
ABS, implied in the formula used to evaluate
the separation distance of adjacent buildings
to avoid seismic pounding in present TBC,
was not satisfactory.
Pounding damages were observed in
the past earthquakes such as Thessaloniki,
Greece (1978), Central Greece (1981),
Guerrero-Michoacan, Mexico (1985), and
Loma Prieta, Santa Cruz (1989), etc.
Especially for the 1985 Mexico earthquake, it
shocked the world and attracted more
concerns on structural pounding problem of
buildings. A clear review of the reported
pounding damage was given by
Anagnostopoulos (1995). In 1999, the
Chi-Chi earthquake in central Taiwan,
unfortunately, brought towns and villages
near the epicenter to destruction. Not
surprisingly, structural pounding events were
also observed after the earthquake.
In past years, there were many valuable
studies regarding the pounding behavior of
buildings under earthquake motions.
However, most of the investigations
emphasized the deterministic aspect of the
problem. Based on a literature survey
conducted by the author, there exit few
published results on demonstrating the
validity of the pounding related provisions of
the building codes, although the concept and
the philosophy of probability-based design
have been accepted for many years.
The combination method implied in the
formula used to evaluate the separation
distance of adjacent buildings to avoid
seismic pounding in present TBC is the ABS
method. To consider the effect of inelastic
vibration phase difference between two
adjacent buildings on separation distance, a
reduction factor is added to the formula. The
value of the reduction factor is taken as 0.6 in
the 1997 TBC. In addition to ABS method,
the SRSS method has been incorporated in
the 1997 UBC. Note that calibrations of the
pounding related provisions of the major
building codes worldwide are still processing
to date. The need to demonstrate the
feasibility of application of the combination
methods of CQC and SRSS instead of the
ABS method to estimating building
separation specified in the pounding related
provisions of TBC is essential.
The purpose of this study is to
demonstrate the feasibility of application of
the combination methods of CQC and SRSS
instead of the ABS method to estimating
building separation specified in the pounding
4PGA are constructed.
(6).Calculate the “overal” pounding 
probability of adjacent buildings by
combining the results of the seismic
hazard analyses and the relations of the
pounding probability and PGA
constructed in step 5.
5. Key assumptions
a) Earthquake motions
For dynamic analysis of structures, the
design response spectra in Taiwan are
selected. To simulate the transient character
of real earthquakes, the stationary earthquake
motions generated from the power spectral
density function associated with the design
response spectrum are multiplied by a
trapezoidal intensity envelope function. Time
duration for time history analyses is taken as
30 seconds.
b) Characteristics and dynamic behaviors of
building structures
It is assumed that the structural system
of the buildings investigated in this study is
steel moment-resisting frame (SMRF). For
simplicity of the numerical simulation, the
structure is modeled as a multi-degree-of-
freedom shear type model, which exhibits
elasto-plastic behavior in the form of a
hysteretic restoring force-displacement
characteristic. For each building, the relation
of the fundamental period and the building
height is determined from formula (2.9) of
the TBC’97 for steel moment-resisting
frames. The damping ratio of the Rayleigh
type is assumed to be 0.05.
c) Potential pounding location of adjacent
buildings
For adjacent buildings having different
height, the pounding location is assumed to
occur at the top level of the shorter building;
for adjacent buildings having the same height,
the pounding location is assumed to occur at
the roof level of both buildings.
Expected results included in this
research can be summarized as follows:
(1).The feasibility of application of the
combination methods of CQC and SRSS
instead of the ABS method to estimating
building separation specified in the
pounding related provisions of TBC will
be demonstrated.
(2).The effects of the combination methods
of SRSS and CQC on pounding risk and
separation distance of buildings will be
investigated.
(3).There are three soil profile types
specified in the TBC including: soil type
1(rock and stiff soils), soil type 2(deep
cohesionless or stiff clay soils), and soil
type 3(soft to medium clays and sands) to
be considered in this study.
(4).Constructive suggestions for future code
calibrations will be expected in this
research.
6. Numerical Examples
A total of 36 cases of adjacent buildings
A an B are investigated, which include 4
cases for building A (number of stories
building A, na=6, 10, 14, 18) and 9 cases for
building B (number of stories building B,
nb=4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20). The
values of studied parameters are shown in
Table 1.
There are three soil profile types
including soil type 1 (rock and stiff soils),
soil type 2 (deep cohesionless or stiff clay
soils), soil type 3 (soft to medium clays and
sands).
Four combination methods including:
the methods of ABS, SRSS, and CQC and
the TBC’s method are considered in this
study. Based on the combination methods,
the pounding probabilities of adjacent
buildings are investigated.
7. Results and Discussion
Comparisons of building separations,
which are based on the ABS, SRSS, CQC
and TBC’s methods, are made and shown in
Figs.1 to 3 for three soil profiles Not
surprisingly, due to the use of a reduction
coefficient of 0.6 adopted to consider the
effect of vibration phase difference of
adjacent buildings, the building separations
specified by the TBC are significantly
smaller than those by ABS and SRSS
methods. Except for the cases that the
periods of adjacent buildings are closed, the
building separations obtained by the CQC
and SRSS methods are similar. Thus, the
