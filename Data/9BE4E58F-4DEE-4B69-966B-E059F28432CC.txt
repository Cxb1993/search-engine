Aug 11 – 14 SPIE Optics+Photonics, @ San Diego Convention Center, USA 
(Oral Presentation Aug 13) 
Aug 14 SAN > Aug 14 SEA; Aug 18 SEA > Aug 18 YYC(Calgary Int’l Airport)

(1) SPIE Optics+Photonics: Conference 7092: Quantum Communications and Quantum 
Imaging VI, Session 5,Quantum Communications I, 13:15-13:45 (30min), Aug 13. 
A new randomization technique of signaling bases for a quantum stream cipher was proposed. 
For this presentation, there was one question about effect of Gaussian noise.  
(2) QOMC:  
Poster Session 1, 17:30-19:30, Aug 20. 
A computer simulation result of the deliberate error randomization by Golay code was shown.  
 
二、與會心得 
(1) SPIE Optics+Photonics:  The session contains 4 presentations including me. The other 
three are concerned with single-photon-based quantum key distribution systems. It seems that 
application of WDM is in vogue in the research society of single-photon-based system.  
(2) QCMC: In this conference, we could meet many researchers in the field of quantum 
information science. In this conference, there were three presentations related to the quantum 
stream cipher except for my presentation; M.Sohma (Tamagawa University), et al., “Effects of
