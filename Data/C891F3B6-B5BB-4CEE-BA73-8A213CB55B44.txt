However, MOSFETs are generally operated in AC mode in 
CMOS circuits, so many researchers have studied on 
how to switch the τ from DC mode to AC mode (i.e., 
τDC to τAC) and found the transformed factor for 
quick predicting AC lifetime (τAC) of in-circuit 
device. Nevertheless, several problems remain on 
these researches, such as 
(a) The τAC/τDC factor which many researches found 
that they are only suitable for some circuit 
applications due to different AC operating signal. 
The adaptability is not good enough. 
(b) The investigations of lifetime models are based 
on current stress or voltage stress. They seem to 
have questions in theory. 
(c) Early studies may not be suitable for current 
generations. For example, the worst stress condition 
has changed from DAHC to CHC and from low temperature 
to high temperature since 0.13μm technology.  
This study is to precisely find the suitable lifetime 
model for in-circuit MOSFETs. An innovative power 
transform method, which is established as the 
function of voltage (Vd, Vg), current (Id, Ig), and 
temperature (T), is proposed to describe nMOSFET 
degradation after DC and AC CHC stress on 45 nm node 
and beyond. Therefore, threshold voltage shift (ΔVt) 
function will be built and applied in the thereafter 
circuit simulation.  
For circuit applications, device characteristics 
before and after CHC stress are extracted with 
Accelicon MBP (model builder program). The Hspice is 
used to simulate the variation of circuit speed 
before and after stress based on the model cards 
established by MBP. 
The significance of this project is to clearly give 
wafer foundry and IC design house the Ptotal which 
causes device failure and degradation of the circuit 
containing the devices. It is not only reducing the 
tested time but also improving the accuracy.

MOSFETs use HfO2 as the gate dielectrics in the new generation, but they still have 
hot-carrier problem, and more studies are need. Our team invented the Power Transform 
Model to study hot-carrier reliability of 65 nm MOSFETs in the past, and the results of the 
study were good. Hence, Power Transform Model applied in 45 nm nMOSFETs is studied in 
this work. 
In this research, the tested devices were 45 nm nMOSFETs from United 
Micro-electronics Corporation (UMC). The device channel width/length (W/L) = 10/0.1um 
and (W/L) = 10/0.05um.  All tests were conducted at temperatures 55℃. and the stress 
voltage of VD and VG were (2.7 ; 2.7)、(2.7 ; 2.9)、(2.7 ; 3.1)、(2.9 ; 2.7)、(2.9 ; 2.9)、(2.9 ; 
3.1)、(3.1 ; 2.7)、(3.1 ; 2.9)、(3.1 ; 3.1), respectively. Stress modes were DC and AC on 
channel hot-carrier (CHC) conditions. 
From the CHC test results, it is found that the power transform model can successfully 
describe device damage.

BASICS ABOUT THE MOSFET RELIABILITY 
ISSUES 
2.1 Research Hot-Carrier Effect 
2.1.1 Hot-carrier effect 
Hot-carrier is a key effect in MOSFET, the dimensions of 
MOSFET(metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor) scaling is continues to shrink,but 
the channel length and the gate oxide thickness to be slower . In Fig. 2.1, the carriers traversing 
this high field region reach energies which are considerably higher than the average heat energy 
in the semiconductor lattice [2.1]. They may collide with the lattice. As a result, electron/hole 
pairs are generated. This is called impact ionization. 
We got the holes and electrons by called impact ionization, the holes move toward the 
substrate become substrate current. On the other hand, the electrons reach Si/SiO2 interface, the 
electrons be able to tunnel into the oxide become the trapped charge in the Si/SiO2 interface. 
When the device operates for a long time cause the I-V characteristics may change. 
The Ids-Vds and Ids-Vgs characteristics of an nMOSFET before and after hot-carrier stressing 
experiment are shown in Figs. 2.2(a) and (b) respectively [2.2]. The Ids-Vds and Ids-Vgs 
characteristics curve including the forward and reverse characteristics after the stressing 
experiment have been plotted here.

Fig. 2.4. Major mechanisms of channel hot-carrier generation [2.3]. 
 
2.1.3 Temperature effect 
At low temperature, in the early researches hot-carrier effect is enhanced [2.4-2.6]. In Fig. 
2.5, that the maximum substrate current under the same bias condition increases by temperature 
decreases from 300 K to 43 K. It was said that the high temperature would increase phonon 
scattering during the carriers’ movement and decrease their lengths of mean free path, which 
would then lower the substrate current and hot-carrier induced degradation on MOSFETs. Fig. 
2.6 shows the predicted lifetime as a function of bias condition for an nMOSFET at 82, 200, and 
300 K. Again the high temperature one possesses the longest lifetime expectation [2.6]. 
In the recent years, contrary to conventional concepts, Figs. 2.7 and 2.8 show CHC mode 
the worst case has switched from low to high temperature [2.7]. 
Future generations of CMOS integrated circuits, including the current generation, will 
inevitably to be operated at high temperature. State-of-the-art microprocessors reportedly have 
an average power density of over 100 W/cm2 and the junction temperature often exceeds 100  ℃
[2.8]. Therefore, the hot-carrier (HC) reliability of MOSFETs at high temperature must be 
reexamined.

2.2.3 The Takeda model 
In 1983, Takeda [2.13] suggested a simple time dependent model for parameter shifts 
based on the experiments performed. Device degradation in Vt and Gm is shown as a function of 
stress time with Vd as a parameter in Fig. 2.10. 
 
 
Fig. 2.10. Device degradation in Vt and Gm as a function of stress time with Vd as a 
parameter for a MOS device having Leff = 0.8 μm and Tox = 20 nm [2.13]. 
 
In their experiments, they observed that ΔVt or %ΔGm could be modeled empirically using 
expressions such as 
 
n
mmt AtGGorV  )/  ( 0 ,                                   (2.10) 
 
where A and n are empirical parameters. The parameter n has a strong dependence on the gate 
bias used during the stressing experiments but little dependence on the drain bias. This suggests 
that n changes according to hot-carrier injection mechanisms.  
Similarly, the parameter A shows a strong dependence on the drain bias while it’s 
independent of the gate bias. This was proven by experimental results, as shown in Fig. 2.11. 
 
 14 
 
Therefore, many researchers studied how to switch the device lifetime from DC mode to AC 
mode (i.e., τDC to τAC) and to find the AC to DC lifetime factor for quick-predicting the τAC of 
in-circuit devices. In 1986, T. HORIUCHI et al [2.14] suggested a simple analytical expression 
to estimate hot-carrier induced nMOSFET degradation under AC stress, based on an empirical 
relation between device lifetime and substrate current in static stress. The device lifetime is 
related to substrate current by [2.13]

DC ,                                              (2.12) 
 
where τDC is device lifetime and Isub is substrate current. A, l are constant. The results are shown 
in Fig. 2.12. The power law relation with the slope of -2.5 (l=2.5). The device lifetime under 
pulsed bias condition was also measured, changing gate or drain pulse duty ratio. In the case of 
pulsed gate bias, gate pulse height and pulse-width were 2 V and 100 ns or 10 ps, while drain 
was kept at 6.2 V. In the case of pulsed drain bias, drain pulse height and -width were 6.2 V and 
500 ns, while gate voltage was kept at 2 V. Since substrate current pulse is generated in AC 
stress, the device lifetime can be written by

where Isub,peak is the peak value of substrate current and R is duty ratio for substrate current pulse. 
Using a test circuit as shown in Fig. 2.13 (a), device lifetime in inverter operation was measured 
and the results were compared with calculation results obtained from (2.13). Fig. 2.13 (b) shows 
input voltage, output voltage, and substrate current waveforms in the test circuit. Fig. 2.14 
compares device lifetime between the experiment and the calculation, as a function of power 
supply voltage. The solid line shows the calculated result obtained from (2.13). Excellent 
agreement between experiment and calculation has been obtained.

In 1995, Akira Ito [2.15] suggested a simple analytical expression to estimate lifetime of 
nMOSFETs in the circuits based on the peak and duration of the substrate current. The device 
degradation model for DC stress can be described as Eq. (2.14) [2.13]. Then (2.14) can be 
rewritten for AC stress as Eq. (2.15) [2.16].

and AC stress, the CMOS inverters were stressed with a constant Vdd and a sawtooth input as

Also, the waveform is assumed to be symmetrical with respect to the peak. Then substituting Eq.

The conclusion of this study, lifetimes of nMOSFETs in AC condition can be correlated using 
Eq. (2.17). 
In 2006, Predrag Habas [2.17] suggested a simple analytical expression to estimate lifetime 
of nMOSFETs subjected to periodic large-drain-signal in analog circuits. This model is base on 
current injected induced device degradation. In constant-bias HC stress the amount of created 
interface traps may be expressed as Eq. (2.18) [2.11]. Author supposes that the AC conditions 
like in the DC conditions. Using these assumptions, the total amount of accumulated damage 
may be expressed as Eq. (2.19).

The conclusion of this study, lifetimes of nMOSFETs in AC condition can be correlated using 
Eq. (2.25). 
 
2.4 Problem Formulation 
However above observation and inference fail to estimate DC and AC lifetime. The failure 
can be viewed in two aspects. 
1. The applicability of the issue:  
In the early researches, Predrag Habas [2.17] and Akira Ito [2.15] and many other scholars 
have employed lucky electron or substrate current concept to switch the lifetime from DC mode 
to AC mode (i.e., τDC to τAC) and to find the AC to DC lifetime factor. This concept is more 
applicable to DAHC, but the worst degradation mode was switched from DAHC to CHC. In 
these researches, they are only suitable for some specific circuit application. For different AC 
operating signals, they have applicability of the issue. 
2. The accuracy of the issue:  
Some investigations of lifetime models are based on constant current stress (CCS) or 
constant voltage stress (CVS), but they should be more concerned. 
In the lifetime models, we basic on the constant current stress(CCS) and constant 
voltage stress(CVS). 
(a) CCS: In the CCS, the stress current can describe the amount of carriers in the channel. 
Shown as in Fig. 2.21, when the dervice arrive the saturation region (point A ), the 
carrier have a liitle variation in the channel, and enchance the lateral electric field 
induce the carrier speed. 
(b) CVS: The carrier speed related with the stress voltage, but wouldn’t direct describe 
the carrier induce device damage. 
So, we can’t use only use the CCS or CVS to estimate DC or AC lifetime, because it’s not 
accurate. 
    In this study, we extend the Takeda empirical modelT[2.16] to explain the CHC 
phenomena.So we need the new way, power transform, that includes the voltage (Vd, Vg), current 
(Id, Ig), and temperature (T), is used to find the AC lifetime of high temperature CHC. As ΔVt,lin 
reaches to 10 mV (device failure criterion) in DC stress, the total transformed power (Ptotal) 
which causes device failure is calculated. The purpose is to precisely find the suitable lifetime 
model for in-circuit device.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS 
 
3.1 Experimental Structures 
In this work, nMOSFETs on wafers from 45 nm generation of UMC (United 
Microelectronics Corporation) were characterized. Fig. 3-1 shows the HfO2 process flows. After 
standard cleaning, the first deposited is SiO2 interfacial layer (7~10Å) with temperature 900℃, 
and the HfO2 dielectric was 28 Å~30 Å(30 cycles) by atomic layer deposition method.  The 
oxygen PDA was performed at 500℃ for 60 s in 10% O2 ambient. Next, a TiN metal electrode 
was formed on top of the gate stack and followed by source/drain implant and 1000℃ activation 
anneal. 
For nMOSFETs, my research would verify the model(power transform) accuracy with 
stress model(DC stress), the nMOSFETs with channel width/length(W/L) = 10/0.1μm. All the 
experiments were done at temperatures of  25°C, 55°C, and 85°C. In the Fig. 3.2, the 
experiments flowchart of the DC stress, Before and after stressing, the device parameters, 
including threshold voltage (Vt), and drain current (Id) at different operation were measured. The 
above test would utilize Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system and Agilent 
81101A pulse generator.

From Eqs. (4.6) and (4.7), two slopes B1 and B2 can be obtained. In order to find the slopes, 
B1 and B2, we have designed two experiments for DC and AC conditions, that shown in the 
Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, respectively. The values of B1 and B2 can be obtained from Figs. 4.10 
to 4.11, and then A1 and A2 can be calculated, as shown in Tables 4.3. According to Figs. 4.12 
to 4.13 would obtain n value, which were 0.257 for DC and 0.312 for AC condition. The 
value of γ can be obtained from Fig. 4.14. The value of γ in DC condition and AC condition 
are the same. These parameters are exhibited in Table 4.3. 
Therefore, for a certain amount of degradation defined as the lifetime criteria, the DC 
lifetime τDC and AC lifetime τAC can be obtained from Eq. (4.2) and expressed as Eq. (4.8) and 
Eq. (4.9), where C1 and C2 are fitting constant. From Eqs. (4.8-4.9) it follows the ratio of 
lifetime for AC and DC CHC stress, it can be expressed as Eq. (4.10).

Use the Gm degradation and Vt,lin shift in log-log scale exhibits almost the same time 
power law, thus we can infer generated oxide trapped charges must be minor in quantity and are 
negligible. Figs. 4.14 to 4.17 show the time power law between Gm degradation and Vt,lin shift. 
In AC CHC stress, higher stress voltage with high temperature condition (Vg=Vd=3.1 V and 85 
°C), the time power law between Gm degradation and Vt,lin shift is much similar than DC CHC 
stress, as shown in Figs. 4.14 and 4.15. In lower stress voltage with high temperature condition 
(Vg=Vd=2.7 V and 25 °C), the time power law between Gm degradation and Vt,lin shift are the 
same for DC and AC stress, as shown in Figs. 4.16and 4.17. 
Thus, we can infer the nMOSFET degradation mechanism is different from DC and AC 
stress which leads to the different parameters of power transform model under DC and AC 
condition.

In this work, the device lifetime defined as the Vt,lin shift equals 10 mV. Using Eq. (4.2) 
the lifetime of nMOSFET devices can be calculated and drawn as Figs. 4.26 to 4.27. Not that 
the lifetime of AC CHC condition > DC CHC condition > 10 years. 
In AC CHC condition, the lifetime of different signal amplitude, can be calculated and 
drawn as in Fig. 4.31. Thus it can be seen, if the device lifetime wants to greater than 10 years, 
the total transformed power (Ptotal,AC) can not be greater than 83.33×10
-3 under 55℃. The 45 
nm and 65 nm ratios of lifetime τAC/τDC extract from Eq. (4.10) are displayed in Table 4.4 and 
Table 4.5. Comparison the 45 nm and 65 nm of the ratio of lifetime τAC/τDC, the 65 nm of ratio 
is higher than 45 nm.
