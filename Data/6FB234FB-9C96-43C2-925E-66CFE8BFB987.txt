2、Meshless formulation using radial basis function 
of the imaginary-part kernel 
The governing equation for an interior membrane 
problem is the Helmholtz equation as follows: 
,,0)()( 22 Dxxkxu ∈=+∇  (1)
where 2∇  is the Laplacian operator, D is the domain 
of the cavity and k is the wave number which is 
angular frequency over the speed of sound. The 
boundary conditions can be either the Neumann or 
Dirichlet type. 
The radial basis function is expressed by 
)(),( ijji xssxG −= ϕ  (2)
where ix  and js  are the ith collocation and jth 
source points, respectively. The Euclidean norm 
ij xs −  is referred to as the radial distance between 
the collocation and source points. The two-point 
function ( ij xs −ϕ ) is called radial basis function 
since it depends on the radial distance between ix  
and js . By considering the imaginary-part kernel of 
fundamental solution for the Helmholtz equation 
( )}(Im{),( )1(0 kriHxsU = ) with the globally-supported 
radial basis function, we can choose the four kernels 
in the dual formulation,

where xsr −≡  is the distance between the source

the outnormal vector at s; in  is the ith component of 
the outnormal vector at x, nJ  denotes the first-kind 
Bessel function of the nth order, and iii xsy −≡ . 
Based on the dual formulation for the indirect method, 
we can represent the displscement field solution by

3、Calculation for the diagonal elements in the four 
influence matrices using the spitalohL 'ˆ,  rule and 
invariant method  
The diagonal elements in the influence matrices 
where the radial distance is zero (r = 0 when i = j) 
can be solved by using the spitalohL 'ˆ,  rule. 
Considering the asymptotic behavior and the 
recurrence relations of Bessel functions, we can 
obtain the diagonal elements as follows:

4、The multi-domain method for the eigenproblem 
with a degenerate boundary  
Consider a membrane with a stringer as shown in Fig. 
1(a). The boundary conditions are given as follows: 
Bonxxu ,0)( =  (9)
where B is the essential boundary with the specified 
homogeneous displacement. The stringer B can be 
composed of stringer (degenerate boundary) +C  and 
−C  as shown in Fig.1(a), (b) and (c). For the 
homogeneous boundary conditions, we can determine 
the critical wave number k by using the RBF. Since 
the degenerate boundary on +C  and −C  as shown 
in Fig.(2) produces double unknowns. By dividing the 
domain into two subdomains (index 1 and 2) and 
using the RBF for each subdomain, we have the two 
equations as follows:
