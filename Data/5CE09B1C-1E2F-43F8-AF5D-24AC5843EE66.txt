中文摘要 
 
本計畫內容針對以 IEEE 802.11 為基礎的數位家庭，其現實環境下無線網路在進行資料傳輸時，
遭遇非對稱通道傳輸與效能異常問題導致資源分享不均，過去相關文獻皆僅從單一問題著手，缺乏全
面性的設計考量。因此在本計畫中，我們預計提出整合性的通道存取設計，提出了一個動態調整傳輸
機制(Dynamic and adaptive transmission scheme, DAT)來同時解決非對稱通道傳輸與效能異常問題
導致資源分享不均的問題。此傳輸機制考量了傳輸節點的角色和傳輸速率，如果傳輸節點的速率較快，
系統則允許此節點在得到傳輸機會時能傳送出較多的封包數量，而傳輸速率較慢的節點只能送出較少
的封包，使用此方式可以減輕網路效能異常問題。同時，如果傳送節點是基地台，系統則允許送出更
多的封包，用以平衡所有行動節點上傳的資料量,以達到通道上傳下載的公平。藉由這樣的設計，可以
提升整體系統傳輸的效能並且同時達到公平性。透過網路模擬器與其他相關傳輸方法比較，證明了動
態調整傳輸機制的有效性。計劃執行的主要成果發表於 Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences

Abstract 
 
This project  focuses  the  research  on  digital  home  which  is  based  on  IEEE  802.11 
wireless networks. The transmissions in such scenario may encounter two serious problems, i.e. asymmetric 
link and performance anomaly.  These problems result in resource unfair bandwidth sharing and degradation 
of system performance. However, the previous researches usually tried to enhance the system performance by 
solving either of the problems. In this project,  a  total  solution, which is called dynamic and adaptive 
transmission scheme (DAT), to  the  asymmetric  link  and  performance  anomaly problems  is 
proposed. Each wireless mobile station will consider its data rate to decide the number of packets to transmit 
when it gets the privilege to access medium. Moreover, the AP has more right to download more packets for 
the purpose of balancing total uplink traffic. The system throughput of the proposed DAT is discussed and 
validated by the simulations and analytical results. The simulations also show that the proposed DAT 
outperforms the previous mechanisms. This result of this project has been accepted by the special issue of 
Applied Mathematics & Information Sciences journal.

amount of power. In the CWD method, the high-rate stations are simply assigned a smaller contention 
window (CW) such they can access the channel more easily. Finally, in the IFG approach, high-rate stations 
with a shorter IFG are granted preferential access to the channel relative to those low-rate stations with a 
longer IFG. However, while the IFG method improves the network performance, it inevitably induces a 
temporal unfairness among the various channel users. 
In this paper, we consider the uplink/downlink unfairness and performance anomaly problems together and 
proposed a dynamic and adaptive transmission scheme (DAT) for solving both problems in a multi-rate 
WLAN. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The DAT scheme is proposed in Section 2 and the 
analytical throughput model for the proposed DAT is discussed and validated in Section 3. Section 4 describes 
the simulation results. Section 5 presents the conclusion and indicates the future research.  
 
2  The Proposed Scheme 
By the study of the related work, we found that previously individual solutions to both problems by tuning 
the same parameters, i.e. CW, TXOP or IFS, to accomplish their goals.  Also, we don’t plan to modify the 
basic operations of IEEE 802.11 behaviors and reserve the temporal fairness property for each wireless mobile 
station. It means that the transmitter with higher data rate will transmit more packets once it gets the right to 
access the channel and the slower one will transmit fewer packets for mitigating the performance anomaly 
problem, but each mobile station occupies almost the same channel access time. Moreover, the AP is designed 
to transmit packets that are equal to summation of traffic each mobile station can send one time to solve the 
asymmetric uplink/downlink bandwidth sharing problem. 
More specifically, assume that there are one AP with the fixed data rate and N wireless stations with m 
varied data rates in a multi-rate WLAN, where the date rate ranging from low to high is  to , 
i.e. , and the data rate of AP is fixed at . The number of nodes with data rate  is  
and the number of total nodes in the system is . When the wireless station with 
data rate  gets the privilege to access the medium, it can transmit  packets and the AP can 
transmit  packets. 
 
3  Experimental Results  
This  section  compares  the  system  performance  of  the  proposed DAT  scheme  with  
legacy  TXOP,  MBT,  AAP,  CWD,  and  PSD mechanisms   under   various   multi-rate   
scenarios.   The   simulation programs  were  written  in  C++  to  simulate  an  IEEE  802.11b  
WLAN with infrastructure mode setting and operate with four data rates, i.e. 1, 2, 5.5 and 11Mbps. We only 
considered the basic access transmission mode. Each station and AP is assumed to have enough packets to 
send in  order  to  obtain  the  saturated  throughput  in  an  error  free  medium. Also, no hidden 
terminals are  in  the  simulated  environment.  The physical and MAC parameters used in simulation 
are listed in Table I.

Abstract—IEEE 802.11e standard is specified to support QoS 
(Quality of Service) in wireless local area networks for 
multimedia traffic such as real-time audio and video streaming. 
It proposes two wireless network access mechanisms to support 
QoS: HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) and Enhanced 
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). EDCA is a contention-
based scheme. When the network size is increased, there will be 
more collisions and idle slots. Therefore, the performance will 
degrade a lot. To cope with this problem, this study proposed a 
High Performance Distributed Coordination Function with 
QoS support (QHDCF) protocol to enhance the performance. 
In QHDCF, the transmitting station determines the next 
transmitter according a selection rule from a probability 
formulation perspective based on the priorities and numbers of 
stations in different traffic classes. Since, in the proposed 
QHDCF, stations do not contend for channel access, 
transmission collisions are reduced a lot, and hence the 
network throughput is enhanced. Moreover, in EDCA, the 
high-priority traffic will always get the transmission 
opportunity and therefore low-priority traffic will suffer 
starvation. In contrast, in QHDCF, the high-priority traffic has 
better transmission opportunity on a probability base and 
hence does not starve the low-priority traffic. Simulation 
results show that the proposed QHDCF protocol outperform 
EDCA protocol in different packet sizes and number of stations.

1.  INTRODUCTION  
With the advance of wireless communication technology, 
wireless local area networks (WLANs) have become more 
and more popular. The mostly commercialized WLAN 
products are nowadays based on the IEEE 802.11 standard 
[1], because of its simple, distributed and easy-to-be-
deployed nature. It operates in two modes: one is the 
infrastructure mode and the other is the ad hoc mode. In the 
infrastructure mode, Access Point (AP) is a coordinator, 
which manages the transmission between stations. All 
stations must associate with an AP to have transmission 
service in the network. In the ad hoc mode, every station can 
communicate with each other within its transmission range 
without an AP. In this paper we focus on the ad hoc mode. 
In IEEE 802.11 standard, there are two access modes 
coordinating the wireless medium access: Distributed 
Coordination Function (DCF) and Point Coordination 
Function (PCF). DCF is a contention-based access protocol 
using Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision 
Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and the backoff procedure is used to 
avoid collision. Each of the stations has to count the random 
backoff time before transmission. PCF uses a contention-free 
mechanism which is a polling-based protocol. In general, 
DCF works well under light traffic load conditions with less 
contentions and low throughput; whereas, PCF works well 
under heavy traffic load conditions [5]. However, IEEE 
802.11 cannot satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) 
requirements. Due to the growing demands of multimedia 
traffic transmission, IEEE 802.11e is proposed to support 
time-sensitive applications. It proposes Hybrid Coordination 
Function (HCF), which is composed of HCCA (HCF 
Controlled Channel Access) and EDCA (Enhanced 
Distributed Channel Access) mechanisms. In HCCA, a 
Hybrid Coordinator (HC) is used to allocate transmission 
opportunities (TXOP) to mobile stations by polling each 
station periodically. HCCA works well on fixed data rate. 
EDCA supports four Access Categories (ACs) to provide 
differentiated QoS in the wireless networks. Like DCF, 
EDCA works well under light traffic load conditions, but the 
throughput of low priority traffic cannot be guaranteed while 
the number of stations is increased.  
Many existing researches in the literature are devoted to 
the performance enhancement for DCF. Song et al. [6] 
propose a backoff algorithm to enhance the performance of 
DCF by employing Binary Exponential Backoff (BEB) 
algorithm. When a collision occurs, the contention window 
(CW) is doubled. On the other hand, the CW is halved after a 
successful transmission. This mechanism enhances the 
performance when the number of stations is large. In [7], 
HDCF is proposed to mitigate the problem of wasting time in 
contention resolution. It divides stations into contention and 
active ones. Only new stations need to contend for the 
channel access. The stations that are already in the Active-
List will not contend for the channel access. Each station 
maintains its own Active-List and determines the next station 
from the Active-List. Thus, all the stations in the Active-List 
can transmit data with equal probability. HDCF is shown to 
have greater performance than DCF since the contentions for 
channel access are reduced. However, HDCF does not 
support differentiated QoS in the networks. 
In this paper, we propose a High-performance Distributed 
Coordination Function with Qualified of Service support 
(QHDCF) to enhance the performance for multimedia traffic 
transmission. There are two modes in QHDCF: contending 
mode and active mode. In the contending mode, the stations 
follow EDCA mechanism to contend for channel access. The 
successful station will then switch to active mode to transmit 
data. In the meantime, the transmitting station will decide the 
next transmitter from the Active-List, which records all the 
3. THE PROPOSED QHDCF PROTOCOL 
This study proposes a QoS aware high-performance DCF 
(QHDCF) protocol to reduce the contention in IEEE 802.11 
DCF. Like HDCF [7], a QHDCF station operates in one of 
two modes: active mode, and contending mode. In the active 
mode, the next transmission station is determined by the 
current transmitting station. Therefore, there is no contention 
among stations for media access. That is, there will be no 
time waste caused by backoffs and collisions. On the other 
hand, stations in contending mode follow legend DCF 
mechanism. In the beginning, all the stations are in 
contending mode. Once a station successfully accesses the 
channel, it switches to active mode. That is, only new 
stations have to contend for the channel access. As a result, 
contentions among stations are greatly reduced and hence the 
throughput can be enhanced. 
3.1 Traffic classes and Active-List for QHDCF 
In HDCF protocol, each station has equal opportunity to 
be selected as the next transmission station by the current 
transmitting station. That is, all data streams in every station 
are of the same priority. Hence, HDCF protocol cannot be 
applied to multimedia environment, in which traffics are 
usually of different priorities. In light of this observation, in 
the proposed QHDCF scheme, a station in the Active-List is 
associated with a class attribute. To conform to the IEEE 
802.11e standard, there are four classes in QHDCF including 
Background, Best effort, Video, and Voice. The four traffic 
classes are associated with different priorities as described in 
Table 1. The first class is the Voice class with the highest 
priority and the fourth class is the Best Effort class with the 
lowest priority.  
Each station maintains an Active-List whose format is 
shown in Table 2. Each entry in the Active-List records the 
information of an active station. Next-Station is the station 
identifier. It is the MAC address of the recorded active 
station compatible with the address format of the generic 
IEEE 802.11 standard. Class records the traffic class of this 
active station. MoreData denotes that if this active station has 
more data packets to transmit after it transmits a data packet. 
Also, it is compatible with the MoreData bit in the Frame 
Control field of a generic IEEE 802.11 data frame. When a 
station receives or overhears a frame from an active station 
with the MoreData bit in the Frame Control field being set as 
“1”, it will update the entry in the Active-List so that the 
MoreData bit for this active station is set as “1”; otherwise, 
the MoreData bit is set as “0”.  
3.2 Determining the next transmission station 
As mentioned above, the current transmitting station is 
responsible for selecting the Next-Station from its Active-
List. Note that the Active-List records all the active stations 
that are eligible to be the next transmission station. To 
support QoS, the priority of traffic class in each active station 
should be taken into account while the current transmitting 
station is determining the Next-Station. Traffic in high 
priority class should have high transmission opportunity. 
That is, a station with traffic in high-priority class will likely 
to be selected as the next transmitter. Based on this reasoning, 
the selection rule for determining the next transmission 
station is formulated from a probability perspective as 
follows.  
Since there are four traffic classes, three probability 
discriminating points are defined as 
             𝑑𝑖 = ∑ (𝑁𝑗×𝑊𝑗)𝑖𝑗=1∑ (𝑁𝑗×𝑊𝑗)4𝑗=1 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3  (1) 
where Ni is the number of stations whose traffics are in class i, 
and Wi is the weight of class i. From equation (1), it is easy to 
see di≤1, for i=1, 2, 3.  
To determine the next transmitter, the transmitting station 
first generates a random value, say p. Let d0=0 and d4=1. 
Then, if di-1<p≤di (i=1, 2, 3, 4), the transmitting station 
randomly selects a station (from the Active-List) whose 
traffic belongs to class i. For example, consider a network of 
eight active stations. Among them, three stations has traffics 
belonging to class 1; three stations has traffics belonging 
class 2; one station has traffic belonging to class 3; and one 
station has traffic belonging to class 4. That is, N1=3, N2=3, 
N3=1, and N4=1. Assume that weights of the four traffic 
classes, wi, are 4, 3, 2, 1 for i=1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Thus, 
according to the equation (1), d1 is 0.5, d2 is 0.875 and d3 is 
0.958. Suppose that the current transmitting station is 
Station 3 and it generates a random value 0.45. Since 
0<0.45≤d1, Station 3, from its Active-List, will randomly 
select an active station whose traffic belonging to class 1.  
However, in case that a large number of stations has 
traffic belonging to one certain class, by using equation (1), 
the other stations that has traffic not belonging to this class 
will be selected with very low probability. To alleviate this 
problem, only weights of classes are considered and the 
formula for probability discriminating points is modified as 
             𝑑𝑖 = ∑ 𝑊𝑗𝑖𝑗=1∑ 𝑊𝑗4𝑗=1 , 𝑖 = 1, 2, 3  (2) 
Consider the network in the above example again. Three 
stations has traffics belonging to class 1; three stations has 
traffics belonging class 2; one station has traffic belonging 
to class 3; and one station has traffic belonging to class 4. 
The weights of the four traffic classes, wi, are 4, 3, 2, 1 for 
i=1, 2, 3, 4, respectively. Thus, according to the equation (2), 
d1 is 0.4, d2 is 0.7 and d3 is 0.9. Suppose that the current

4.1 Simulation Results 
The normalized throughput of QHDCF and EDCA are 
shown in Fig. 5. The packet size ranges from 50 bytes to 
2250 bytes. The number of contending stations is fixed at 50. 
QHDCF_Max is the maximum throughput of QHDCF 
derived with equation (3). QHDCF_1 and QHDCF_2 are the 
throughput of QHDCF derived with equation (1) and (2). 
Simulation results show that as the packet size increases, the 
normalized throughput increases for both the two protocols. 
However, the normalized throughput of QHDCF is much 
better than EDCA. Moreover, the QHDCF nearly achieves 
the maximum throughput. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Throughput vs. packet size 
 
In Fig. 6, the packet size is fixed at 1000 bytes. Four 
scenarios of different number of stations with different traffic 
classes are considered. QHDCF_1 (4:3:2:1) represents that 
the number of stations in class 1, 2, 3 and 4 are in a ratio of 
4:3:2:1. For example, assume that the total stations are ten. 
Then, for QHDCF_1 (4:3:2:1), there will be four stations in 
class 1, three stations in class 2, two stations in class 3, and 
one station in class 4.  
Fig. 6 shows that the throughput of EDCA degrades as 
the number of stations increase since the collisions will 
increase and there will be more idle slots while the number of 
station becomes large. However, both QHDCF_1 and 
QHDCF_2 have better and stable performance than EDCA 
no matter how many stations join the network or how many 
stations have traffic belonging to a certain class. 
In Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, throughputs of Class1, Class2, 
Class3, and Class4 in QHDCF_1 are compared with those of 
their corresponding Access Categories (VO, VI, BE, or BK) 
in EDCA. The numbers of stations in different traffic classes 
are in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 for Fig. 7; 1:2:3:4 for Fig. 8; and 
4:3:2:1 for Fig. 9. Simulation results show that the 
throughput of each class in QHDCF_1 is better than that of 
its corresponding AC in EDCA. Moreover, the throughput of 
low-priority AC in EDCA is very low. This is because that in 
EDCA the high priority traffic always gets the transmission 
opportunity while it has data to be transmitted. Hence, it will 
starve the low-priority traffics. In contrast, in QHDCF, the 
high priority traffic does not always have transmission 
opportunity but just has better transmission opportunity. Thus, 
low-priority traffic will not suffer starvation.
