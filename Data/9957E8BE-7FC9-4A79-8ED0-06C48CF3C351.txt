applied to fabricate four types of silicon sonic 
nozzles with their cross sections in square shape, 
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.  The nozzle throats 
were in the order of 90μm×90μm.  Reynolds 
numbers examined were ranging from 6×102 to 
8×103.  With a specially designed clamping 
holder, the silicon nozzle was able to operate at 
a pressure of 1380kPa at least.  For nozzle 
types of B and C, the critical pressure ratio for 
choking was about 0.36 and 0.32, respectively, 
while types A and B are around 0.2.  Before 
reaching the thermal equilibrium with sonic 
flow, the maximum deviation of the discharging 
coefficient was negligible, i.e., less than 0.05%.  
The silicon nozzle also bears a very good 
long-term stability. 
In this study, the silicon nozzles are made 
in different sizes.  Referring to Table 1, the 
throat dimensions are ranging from 38μm to 
140μm for nozzles of types A and D and 75μ
m to 184μm for nozzles of types B and C.  
The sizing effects on the silicon nozzles are 
studied experimentally.

2. Fabrication of silicon sonic nozzles 
In this study, KOH anisotropic etching 
technique is applied to fabricate silicon sonic 
nozzles.  With the square openings on Si3N4 
deposited on a <100> silicon wafer, the KOH 
etchant would recess along the <111> 
crystalline planes of the wafer [12].  Instead of 
having a circular cross-section normal to the 
flow direction, the achieved silicon nozzle bears 
a square cross-section, as shown in Fig. 2, 
similar to a pyramidal orifice.  The slopes of 
the side walls with respect to the wafer surface 
are 54.7°, which results in a 35.3° half angle for 
the nozzle.  The thickness of the silicon wafer 
is 505µm, denoted by l.  For installation 
concern, the nozzle chip cut from the silicon 
wafer has a dimension of 6mm×6mm, and thus 
more than one hundred chips could be obtained 
from a 4” wafer. 
The sizes of the silicon nozzles examined 
in this study are listed in Table 1.  For types A 
and D, the nozzle throats have the dimensions 
of 38µm, 90µm, and 140µm.  On the other 
hand, the throat dimensions for types B and C 
are of 75µm, 94µm, 135µm, and 188µm.  It is 
noted that during experiments, the nozzle chip 
of type D is just an inverse installation of the 
type A nozzle chip with respect to the flow 
direction.  Likewise, the nozzle chip of type C 
is an inverse of type B.  The length of the 
convergent section is about 2 times of the 
divergent section for type B. 
In addition, by using surface micro 
machining, a micro thermal sensor is made on 
the nozzle of type A.  As seen in Fig. 3, 
platinum, Pt, is deposited surrounding the 
nozzle exit.  This Pt sensor has a line width of 
20µm, and a thickness of 0.1µm.  Hence, the 
temperature of the nozzle exit can be measured.  
Before experiments, calibration of the sensor 
resistance with respect to the temperature was 
carried out beforehand.  The TCR values are 
about 1.4×10-3(1/℃).

Fig. 6 Cd versus Re for types B and C. 
 
On the other hand, it is also observed that 
the curves of the Cd distributions for the three 
cases are gradually bended up in the lower Re 
regime as l/d gets smaller.  For A_1 and A_2 
the Cd distributions are similar to traditional 
sonic nozzles.  That is to say the Cd value is 
smaller in the lower regime of Re.  However, 
the Cd value shows a different way for A_3; the 
Cd value gets a little higher as Re decreases.  
Specifically, the Cd value at the highest Re is 
about 0.8763, while the Cd value at the lowest 
Re is 0.23% higher in this case.  The reason 
for explaining this is speculated as follows.  
As l/d gets smaller and smaller, the flow would 
be difficult to accelerate to sonic condition in 
the convergent section of the nozzle.  Instead, 
the flow passing over the throat will continue to 
accelerate to reach a minimum area of potential 
flow, usually called the plan of vena contracta, 
which is smaller than the actual size of throat.  
The situation becomes similar to the flow of an 
orifice plate.  Due to inertia of airflow, the 
plan of vena contracta gets larger as Re gets 
smaller, an inverse tendency to viscous 
boundary layer effect. 
As a counterpart, the solid symbols in Fig. 
5 present the results of type D nozzles.  Unlike 
type A nozzle, type D nozzle does not provide a 
convergent passage for airflow before the 
nozzle throat.  As seen, the Cd distributions 
for these three cases are much more like the 
discharging coefficient of an orifice plate.  
That is to say, the Cd value increases as Re gets 
lower.  The results implies that type D nozzle 
behaves like the flow through an orifice plate 
operated with sonic condition.  Hence, the 
distributions of the Cd curves can be directly 
related to vena contracta phenomenon, as 
mentioned above.  On the other hand, since 
types A and D are actually the same nozzle chip, 
a comparison of the results suggests that the 
effective throat area of type A is about 10% 
larger than type D for the corresponding cases. 
The results for nozzles B and C are 
depicted in Fig. 6.  These two types of nozzles 
bear convergent and divergent parts for the 
nozzle flow.  The hollow symbols denote the 
Cd values for type B and solid symbols for type 
C.  It is observed that the Cd values for type C 
are slightly larger than those of type B.  
Whether it implies a thinner viscous boundary 
layer in the throat region needs further 
investigation.  For B_1 and B_2, the 
experimental data have good linearity to Re-0.7 
with an acceptable error less than ±0.1%; on the 
other hand, it is Re-1 for B_3 and B_4.  For 
type C, the fitting curves for all of the four 
cases examined can be fitted well with Re-0.7. 
As known, the mass flow rate through a 
sonic nozzle is not influenced by the 
downstream conditions as long as the nozzle is 
at choking condition.  The ratio of downstream 
pressure to upstream pressure of the nozzle 
usually serves as a choking parameter.  In this 
study, the critical back pressure ratio, denoted 
as CBPR, is defined as the discharge coefficient 
becomes 0.1% below the initial value at 
choking condition [6].  As an example, Fig. 7 
gives the deviations of the discharge coefficient 
for type A.  Here, Pb denotes the downstream 
pressure of the nozzle, and Pu is the upstream 
pressure.  For each of the nozzle chips, Pu is 
operated at 100kPa and 300kPa, respectively, 
while Pb is adjusted from low to high.  By the 
system, the temperature of the Pt sensor is 
recorded. 
Fig. 11a shows the temperatures recorded 
in a time length of 120 seconds.  The 
Reynolds number is 6.2×103.  The temperature 
upstream of the nozzle is shown by rhombic 
symbols and the surface temperature of the 
nozzle exit is shown by triangular symbols.  
As seen, both of the temperatures are at 22.43oC 
initially, and then raise up while the flow starts.  
Later, they fall down gradually. After about 50 
seconds, the upstream temperature recoveries to 
room temperature first.  However, the nozzle 
temperature takes longer to reach equilibrium.  
In order to clarify the response of nozzle 
temperature, the difference between the nozzle 
and upstream temperatures, ∆T, is given in Fig. 
11b.  It is observed that the nozzle temperature 
is a little larger at the beginning stage and then 
it is cooled down quickly by sonic flow in the 
first few seconds.  Finally, it reaches an 
equilibrium state with the flow at the time of 
about 70 second, which is 20 seconds behind 
and 0.68oC below the upstream temperature.

Correspondingly, the deviation of the Cd 
value is given in Fig. 11c.  The deviation is 
reference to the Cd value taken at the time 
instant of 120 second.  The Cd data in the first 
5 seconds are neglected due to drastic pressure 
change.  As seen, the deviation decreases very 
soon to a negligible level, saying 0.05%, in a 
time length less than 20 seconds.    For 
reference, the glass nozzle of Bignell [3] 
required about 1 hour.  This result indicates 
that the silicon nozzle reaches its thermal 
equilibrium much faster than traditional nozzles.  
The reasons are that the thermal inertia of the 
nozzle chip is tiny and also the chip is isolated 
from the nozzle holder; hence, little heat 
exchange is occurred between the sonic flow 
and the nozzle body. 
 
5. Concluding Remarks 
In this study, macro properties of the 
silicon sonic nozzles are examined in different 
sizes for four types.  According to the results, 
it is found that no matter the types of nozzles 
the larger the nozzle size the higher the 
discharge coefficient will be.  Due to the 
special geometry of the present nozzles, not 
only viscous boundary layer but also vena 
contracta phenomenon has to be considered to 
influence the discharge coefficient. 
Experimental results also show that types 
B and C have higher critical pressure ratios than 
types A and B, signifying that silicon nozzles 
with a convergent-divergent geometry would 
give better performance.  If type B or C is 
made with perfect etch, the critical pressure 
ratio can be in the level of 0.4. 
With a micro thermal sensor made around 
the exit of type A nozzle, the temperature 
variation of the nozzle is measured as well as 
the discharge coefficient.  The data recorded 
show that the silicon nozzle responses to the 
sonic flow very quickly, saying in a few 
seconds.  Also, the deviation of Cd decreases 
very rapidly to a negligible level, saying 0.05%, 
in a time length less than 20 seconds. 
In the near future, the flow physics in the 
silicon nozzles will be carried out numerically.
