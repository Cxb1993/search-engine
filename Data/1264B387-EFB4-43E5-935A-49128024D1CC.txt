Abstract 
A rotor system composed of flexible shaft, unbalanced disks, elastic supports and a 
shaft coupling with parallel offset was investigated. Besides, the dynamic behaviors 
and characteristics of a rotor containing a transverse crack are analyzed as well. The 
authors first derived the transfer matrix method for rotating shafts and discovered that 
the boundary shears were mutual coupling and time dependent in two perpendicular 
directions due to rotation. The coupling shears affected the shaft’s critical speeds up to 
50%. The transfer matrix of a flexible coupling with parallel offset was then derived 
and its effects on critical speeds and whirling response were particularly focused on. 
The Numerical calculation showed that the flexibility of a coupling significantly 
influenced the rotor-bearing critical speeds. The parallel offset, yet, played as an 
excitation force to rotor system as an unbalance. The coexistence of disk unbalance and 
coupling offset revealed that the offset caused more significant effects at rational speeds 
but the unbalance increased its weight with the rotation speed due to the centrifugal 
force. Response amplitude and whirl orbits across the offset were illustrated and it was 
discovered that in certain rotation range the shaft whirled asynchronously across the 
offset. The critical speeds varied with the shaft’s crack locations and depth, and it 
decreased rapidly when the crack approached to the middle position of the rotating 
shaft. However, if the crack happened at inflection points of a specific mode, the 
critical speeds scarcely changed. A deeper crack was always imposed more critical 
speeds drops, as expect. The shaft’s rotation speed how to affect the natural frequencies 
of the system also were discussed.

1.Introduction 
Approaches to dynamic analysis of rotor systems can be basically divided into two 
main streams. The first one is the finite element method (FEM) [1-2], and the second 
one is the transfer matrix method (TMM) [3]. As to the existing literature related to 
TMM, Prohl [4] employed TMM for the dynamic analysis of rotor systems. Lund and 
Orcutt [5] established the transfer matrix of shaft in a continuous concept but neglected 
both rotary inertia and gyroscopic effect. Chao and Huang [6] introduced a modify 
transfer matrix extended from Myklestad’s transfer matrix but employed the Euler beam 
and rigid disk as fundamental elements and obtained better natural frequencies and 
shapes than those of discrete model. Many researchers [7-8] continuously added efforts 
into TMM such as developing oil-film bearing matrix, including rotary inertia, 
gyroscopic effects of disks and many others. Though TMM has been extensively applied 
for rotor analysis, to the authors knowledge, none of them included the commonly seen 
case of shafts misalignment. Concerning the studies of shaft misalignment, Dewell and 
Mitchell [9] experimentally studied parallel and angular misalignment of a 
metallic-disk-type coupling. They used real time analyzer and verified that frequencies 
of n× speed appeared due to misalignment. They suggested the 2× and 4× components 
be used for misalignment diagnosis. Xu and Marangon adopted a universal joint for 
misalignment and employed the component mode synthesis to analytically [10] studied 
and experimentally [11] validated the calculations. The concluded that the unbalance 
and misalignment could be characterized by 1× and 2× components, respectively. Lee 
and Lee [12] employed FEM for misaligned rotor-bearing system. In their studies,

Note that Eq. (2) reveals a very important phenomenon that boundary shears couple 
with displacements in time derivatives in two perpendicular directions, as underlined, 
due to the occurrence of rotation. Unlike a non-rotating shaft, in which the boundary 
shears in two perpendicular directions, said Vy and Vz, are uncoupled and time 
independent to each other. The coupling terms could be significant at very high 
rotational speed as to be shown. Solve the boundary value problem of eqs.(1,2) and 
draw its frequency  loci on  Figure 2. Figure 2 illustrates the coupling shears effects 
on the shaft’s natural frequencies with rotational speed, where 0/ωω=ω∗ nn , 
0/ωΩ=Ω∗  and nω is the rotating shaft’s nth natural frequency and 0ω is shaft’s first 
flexural natural frequency at 0=Ω . It is noticed that the exact (coupled) solutions have 
lower natural frequencies. That means the shaft’s critical speeds, intersections with 
abscissa, are overestimated if the coupling effects were ignored, e.g., around 50% 
higher for free-free case. 
2.2 Transfer Matrix Of An Offset Misalignment  
There are two types of shaft misalignment, one is of parallel offset as shown in 
Figure 3, and the other is of angular offset as shown in Figure 4. In the present studies a 
flexible coupling is modeled as a translational spring combined with a bending spring. 
In between two ends of the coupling, there is a parallel offset as shown in Figure 5. 
According to the equilibrium relations, the authors derive the misalignment transfer 
matrix in the following

The present research derived the transfer matrix for flexible coupling with parallel 
misalignment. The investigation reveals that coupling stiffness affects the critical speeds 
and the offset misalignment plays as an excitation. During the derivation of a rotating 
shaft transfer matrix, the authors found that the boundary shears in two perpendicular 
directions were coupled together due to rotation. The coupling shears affected the most 
as the shaft was free at both ends. It might reduce the shaft’s first critical speed up to 
50%. The derivation of TMM and numerical results revealed that misalignment induced 
lateral response of the same frequency as rotational speed (1×) and that is unlike most of 
the researches where multiple integers (n×) components were found. We believe that the 
reason of n× components disappearing in our derivation is due to the coupling’s 
torsional vibration was not considered. Since the coupling will transmit torque as well 
and if the torsional flexibility of the coupling is taken into account the driven shaft will 
fluctuate torsionally and it causes non-constant rotation. The non-constant speed in 
conjunction with the misalignment and unbalance will consequently generate n× 
frequencies of cyclic forces and moments on lateral vibration. The combined effects of 
disk unbalance and shaft misalignment showed that shaft misalignment imposed much 
greater effect than the disk unbalance at most of rotational speeds. That means the shaft 
misalignment usually plays a dominating role. The effect of disk unbalance will become 
of the same significance as the rotor is at very high rotational speeds. The dynamic 
characteristics of the rotating shaft were significantly influenced by the locations and 
depth of the crack. The critical speeds decreased rapidly when the crack approached to 
the middle position of the rotating shaft. However, if the crack happened at inflection 
points of a specific mode, the critical speeds scarcely changed.
