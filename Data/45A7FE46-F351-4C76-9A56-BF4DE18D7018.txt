本子計畫為三年期計畫 (97/8~100/7)，
目標為實現生醫感測網路上身晶片系統中，
所需之人體傳輸模型(intra-body transmission 
model)、OOK 發射機 (OOK transmitter) 及
CDR 接收機 (CDR receiver)。 
第一年度之目標為實現無線生醫感測網
路晶片系統中，所需之人體傳輸模型。研究
重點為量測及分析點到點之間的信號輸入至
輸出衰減 (I/O attenuation) 特性，以建立人
體訊號傳輸模型之資料庫。我們以四電極模
式量測信號輸入至輸出的衰減，而電極片材
料使用市售的醫學用之 Ag/AgCl 電極片。由
於輸入訊號係透過電極片傳送至人體，以及
輸出訊號係透過電極片由人體傳出，所以電
極片與皮膚的接觸面積、接觸力度與皮膚濕
度和呼吸狀況等等，皆會影響輸入/輸出點之
端點阻抗，所以這些變數應儘量維持在常
態，以方便分析。我們發現人體信號之衰減
類似於低通之特性，在低頻時可等效為 RC
電路，而在高頻時，則需加入等效電感以達
到類似人體傳輸的效果。 
第二年度之目標為實現無線生醫感測網

點為實現各種可行架構之小面積、低功耗與
高性能之單晶片 OOK 發射機，以及與子計

們先以 TSMC 0.18 μm CMOS 技術實現了一
個 19.6 mW 的 OOK 發射機 (於 433 MHz 
時之輸出功率為 0 dBm)，及一個 13.2 mW 
的 OOK 發射機 (於 424 MHz 時之輸出功率
為 0.12 dBm)。之後又實現了一個功率損耗
較小 (12.7 mW) 的 OOK 發射機，以及一個
功率損耗 12.6 mW 的 OOK 接收機。量測結
果顯示 12.7 mW 的OOK 發射機於 433 MHz 
時有 −11.36 dBm 的輸出功率。此外，於 2 
Mbps 的 data rate 下，OOK 接收機仍能正
確地接收並解調來自於 OOK 發射機之調變
訊號。 
第三年度之目標為實現無線生醫感測網

點為實現各種可行架構之小面積、低功耗與
高性能之單晶片 CDR 發射機，以及與子計
畫一實現之資料發射機進行整合測試。我們
先以 TSMC 0.35 μm CMOS 技術實現了一個
2.67 mW的 CDR接收機 (特色為採用 current  
-starved VCO)，及一個 2.17 mW 的 CDR 接
收機電路  (特色為採用 wide-tuning range 
VCO)。之後又實現了一個 2.2 mW、位元錯
誤率相當低的  CDR 接收機  (特色為採用
current-starved VCO 及改良之 Hogge 相位
偵測器)。量測結果顯示，該 CDR 之 VCO 
的調頻範圍為 1.06~ 2.55 MHz。對於 2 Mb/s

2.4 研究方法 
2.4.1 IBC 網路及 IBC-hub 收發機 
Fig. 2 shows the block diagram of the 
proposed IBC network, consisting of the sensor 
node biomedical SOC, the IBC hub, and the 
human body channel. The sensor node 
biomedical SOC can be decomposed into two 
main building blocks, the communication unit 
and the system control unit. The 
communication unit is composed of the OOK 
receiver, data transmitter, and analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC). The system control unit is an 
MCU with Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ 
Transmitter. The MCU turns on the transmitter 
and ADC after receiving the commands. 
Moreover, it is necessary to identify different 
SOC nodes or biomedical data. When the 
transmitter is turned on, the biomedical signal 
with its own ID number will be transmitted. 
Instead of the air, the human body plays the 
role as communication medium and hence 
Ag/AgCl electrodes are used to connect the 
SOC and the human body. The IBC hub, 
consisting of an OOK transmitter, a CDR 
receiver, an MCU, and an RF gateway are 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attached to the wrist-end to communicate with 
both the sensor node biomedical SOC at the 
body-end and the Internet. 
The biomedical signal are digitized and 
transferred to the RF gateway through the 
following processes. First, the OOK transmitter 
of the IBC-hub at the wrist-end transmits the 
commands to the OOK receiver inside the 
biomedical SOC at the body-end when a 
biomedical signal is wanted. After receiving 
commands, the MCU inside the biomedical 
SOC at the body-end wakes up the data 
transmitter and ADC to transmit the digitized 
and modulated biomedical data to the CDR 
receiver of the IBC-hub at the wrist-end. Then, 
the CDR receiver receives the biomedical 
signal through human body and transfers them 
to the RF gateway through the MCU. Finally, 
the RF gateway transmits the collected 
biomedical signal to the Internet.  
This work presents the first IBC-hub 
transceiver with the characteristics of small 
form factor and low power consumption. The 
proposed human-body communication method 
adopts the modulated signal (OOK signal) 
transmission. OOK modulation is the special 
case of amplitude-shift keying (ASK) 
modulation. Modulated power is only 
transmitted when the voltage of signal is high, 
and no power is dissipated when the voltage is 
zero. This is the way to achieve low power

attenuations are 10.3 dB, 14.8 dB and 18.9 dB, 
respectively, at an electrode distance of 20 cm,

the attenuations are 21.7 dB, 27.5 dB and 31 
dB, respectively, at an electrode distance of 20 
cm, 80 cm and 150 cm. The attenuations at 
both 200 MHz and 433 MHz are acceptable for 
IBC.  
Table I is a summary of the extracted 
small-signal parameters of IBC at various 
distances. The results are reasonable since the 
pad parameters (Rpad and Cpad) are independent 
of distance, while the inductance (L1) and 
resistance (R11, R1 and R2) increases with the 
increase of distance, and the capacitance (C1 
and C2) decrease with the increase of distance. 
 
 
2.4.2 電路設計 
2.4.2.1 OOK 發射機設計 
Three OOK transmitters (OOK TX-1, 
TX-2 and TX-3) are designed and implemented. 
Fig. 7(a) shows the schematic of the OOK 
TX-1, which comprises a ring-oscillator, a 
buffer (source follower), and a class-C power 
amplifier (PA). The 433-MHz carrier signal is 
generated by the ring oscillator and the OOK 
modulation is achieved by turning the ring 
oscillator on and off. This can be explained 
briefly as follows: The addition of transistors 
MA and MB to the first inverter stage of the 
ring oscillator makes it function as a NAND 
gate. That is, the output of the first stage of the  
 10
an OOK receiver is also designed and 
implemented. Fig. 10(a) shows the schematic 
of the OOK receiver, which comprises a 
low-noise amplifier (LNA), five-stage cascaded 
gain amplifier, a demodulator, and a data buffer. 
The input impedance of the OOK receiver can 
be represented as follows: 
in
m1 gs1 gs3
1 1Z
g s(C C )
≈ + +      (2) 
Since the input node of the receiver is 
connected to an electrode for contacting human 
skin, To achieve good input impedance 
matching for frequencies around the carrier 
frequency (433 MHz), 1/gm1 roughly equal to 
the impedance looking into the electrode can be 
adopted instead of the traditional 50 Ω. The 
main advantage of the LNA is the channel 
noise of the input transistor M1 at the output 
can be cancelled in the condition of 
m2 1 m3 Sg R =g R⋅ ⋅  because the noise signal 
through transistors M2 and M3 are anti-phase 
[16]. In addition, the current signal through 
transistors M2 and M3 are in-phase and can be 
superposed, so the transconductance gain of the 
LNA can be represented as follows: 
signal m1
m m1 1 m2 m3
signal S m1
I 1/gG = = (g R g +g )
V R +1/g
⋅ ⋅   (3)                                  
Besides, the voltage gain of the five-stage 
cascaded gain amplifier following the LNA can 
be represented as follows: 
5 5o
m L 3 m 3
i 3
V 1Gain [( g )(R R )] (g R )
V R
= ≈ − ≈− , (4)                                               
in which RL is the equivalent load resistance of 
a single stage, and gm (= gmp4 + gmn5) is the 
equivalent transconducatcne of a single stage. 
This cascaded gain amplifier is designed to 
provide an additional 60 dB voltage gain.  
To increase the data rate, a new envelope 
detector is used as the demodulator. The OOK 
modulation as AM modulation also suffers 
from ripple and clipping effects [17]. Because 
of the sharp edge of square modulation 
schemes, it is more critical for an envelope 
detector to remove carrier, and the clipping 
effect is more serious. Normally, the negative 
edge of carrier is too sharp to be followed and  
 
(a) 
 
(b)

of the OOK receiver (OOK RX). 
 
 
the negative edge of output would always be 
clipped by RC time constant of the envelope 
detector. Therefore, the clipping effect all the 
time exists in OOK (or ASK) demodulation 
and the RC clipped time must be small for high 
data rate transmission. Moreover, if clipped 
time occupies a large portion of the bit period, 
the data would be destructed. For high data rate, 
the RC time constant must be small, but only 
little carrier is removed. As shown in Fig. 10(a), 
the restriction can be relaxed by adding a LPF 
(comprises R5, R6, C3 and C4) after the 
traditional envelope detector (comprises R4 and 
C2). The goal of the LPF is to completely 
remove the carrier and thus RC time constant 
of the demodulator can be designed to be 
smaller for higher data rate. 
 
2.4.2.3 CDR接收機設計 
Three CDR receivers (CDR RX-1, RX-2 
and RX-3) are designed and implemented. Fig. 
11(a) shows the block diagram of the CDR 
RX-1, which comprises a pseudo-random 
binary sequence (PRBS), a Hogge phase 
detector (Hogge PD), a charge pump (CP) and 
an LPF, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 
[18]. The PD compares the phase of the 
incoming random data (at a speed of 2 Mb/s) 
and the 2-MHz clock signals (generated by the 
VCO), and produces an error signal  
 12
adjusted by controlling the charge and 
discharge speed through VC. The current mirror 
circuit mirrors the current (controlled by VC) to 
all current-starved inverters. The oscillator is 
equivalent to a tunable ring oscillator with the 
current flowing through the inverters (or the 
oscillation frequency) controlled by the PMOS 
and NMOS current sources.  
Instead of the current-starved VCO (see 
Fig. 11(d)), a wide-tuning range VCO as shown 
in Fig. 12(a), is used for the CDR RX-2. The 
wide-tuning range VCO comprises generator 
reference voltage circuit, current-starved 
inverters and output buffer. The generator 
reference voltage circuit makes the VCO can 
work at VC smaller than Vtn (i.e. the VCO 
functions for VC = 0~VDD), which in turn leads 
to a wider tuning range. Compared with the 
CDR RX-1, the CDR RX-2 has the advantage 
of larger VCO tuning range and quality factor 
(i.e. smaller bit error rate (BER)) (see Table 
III). 
Instead of the traditional Hogge PD (see 
Fig. 11(c) & 13(a)), a novel Hogge PD (see Fig. 
13(b)) is used for the CDR RX-3. As shown in 
Fig. 13(a), owing to the clock-to-Q delay of 
TΔ  in FF1, there is a TΔ  delay for the pulse 
rising at A, which in turn results in the UP 
output TΔ  wider than the actual phase 
difference between Din (the input data signal) 
and clock. In addition, suppose the CK-to-Q 
delay of FF2 is the same as the CK-to-Q delay 
of FF1, then the pulse width of the DN output is 
equal to half clock period (i.e. the actual phase 
difference between Din and clock). This means 
in the condition of locking, a skew of TΔ  is 
sustained between Din and clock so as to 
equalize the widths of the UP and DN pulses. 
Such phase offset would reduce the jitter 
tolerance of the CDR [20]-[22]. To address the 
issue, a novel Hogge PD is proposed for the 
CDR RX-3, as shown in Fig. 13(b). An 
additional DFF (FF3) is added between Din and 
the input of the upper XOR gate. Suppose the 
clock-to-Q delay of FF3 is the same as the 
clock-to-Q delay of FF1, then the pulse width 
of the UP output is equal to half clock period 
(i.e. the actual phase difference between Din 
and clock). This means in the condition of 
locking, theoretically there is no skew between 
Din and clock. Therefore, compared with the 
CDR RX-1 and CDR RX-2, it is reasonable

transmit them to a cellular phone. Note that the 
electrodes of the IBC hub and the sensor node 
biomedical systems were attached to the skin of 
the subject, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 25 shows 
the experimental results that the ECG signals 
had been transmitted successfully by the sensor 
node biomedical systems and finally displayed 
on the cellular phone screen. The P, Q, R, S,

good transmission quality of this work.  
 
2.6 結論與建議 
We demonstrate an IBC-hub transceiver, 
comprises an OOK transmitter and a CDR 
receiver. Since no antenna is required, small 
chip size is achieved. The OOK transmitter in 
the IBC-hub takes commands from the RF 
gateway, and then transmits them to the sensor 
node biomedical SOC through human body. 
The CDR receiver in the IBC-hub receives the 
biomedical signals from the sensor node 
biomedical SOC through human body, and then 
transfers them to the RF gateway through the 
MCU. This transmission methodology in 
conjunction with the proposed IBC network is 
much more power-efficient than wireless 
communication. The measured BER in IBC 
transmission is 2.44×10-9, better than previous 
work. The excellent results indicate the 
IBC-hub transceiver is suitable for IBC system.

The following additional comments and observations that were provided by the Reviewers are provided 
below to assist you in preparing your paper: 
1. Please correct in Fig.5: '4dBm' instead of '4dB'. differences between simulations and measurements in 
Fig.3b and 4 should be discussed. 2. Why are the 'external' inductances on the gate/drain line of lower 
values than the internal L's? Why does fig.6 show a GD = 70ps or so? Is NF=3dB ok for UWB 
applications or not (see I.INTRODUCTION)?

over the whole band of interest. Since the adoption of a 
medium terminal resistance inevitably results in a little 
degradation in input matching bandwidth, a small source-
degeneration inductor (Ls in Fig. 1(a)) was added to enhance 
the input matching bandwidth. Besides, flat and high S21 was 
achieved by using cascoded transistors as the gain cell. 
 
II. CIRCUIT DESIGN 
The CMOS DA was designed and implemented by a 
standard 0.18 μm 1P6M CMOS process provided by a 
commercial foundry. The interconnection lines as well as the 
inductors were placed on the 2.34-μm-thick topmost metal to 
minimize the resistive loss. Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic of 
the proposed DA, with the important device parameters labeled. 
Instead of the traditional 50 Ω terminal resistance and the 
recently proposed RL terminal network [1], an RLC terminal 
network with 140 Ω terminal resistance at dc (and very high 
frequencies) was adopted for the gate transmission line to 
improve the NF performance at low-to-medium frequencies. In 
conjunction with a slightly under-damped Q-factor for the 
second-order NF frequency response, flat and low NF 
performance over the whole band of interest can be achieved. 
The chip micrograph of the finished circuit is shown in Fig. 
1(b). The chip area was 1.158×0.616 mm2 excluding the test 
pads. Fig. 1(c) shows the RL terminal network (with the device 
parameters labeled) in [1], which is used in the following 
simulation. 
Fig. 2(a) shows the simulated NF versus frequency 
characteristics of the CMOS DA at various gate-transmission-
line terminal conditions, including the traditional 50 Ω 
resistance, the RL network (see Fig. 1(c)), and the adopted 
RLC terminal network. As can be seen, compared with the 
traditional 50 Ω terminal resistance, the RL terminal network 
can only reduce the NF of the DA to a flat and low level over 
the medium frequency range of 3-7 GHz, while the adopted 
RLC terminal network can reduce the NF to a flat and low 
level over the whole low-to-medium frequency range of DC-7 
GHz. This explains why an RLC terminal network was adopted 
in this work (see Fig. 1(a)). Also shown in Fig. 2(a) is the 
simulated input return-loss (S11) versus frequency 
characteristics of the CMOS DA at various gate-transmission-
line terminal conditions. Clearly, the NF performance at low 
frequencies (by adopting an RLC terminal network) was 
enhanced at the expense of a little degradation of S11 at low 
frequencies. Since the DA can achieve flat and low NF and flat 
and high gain (see Fig. 3(a)) over the whole band of interest, 
the little degradation of S11 at low frequencies is trivial. 
Fig. 2(b) shows the simulated NF and output return loss 
(S22) versus frequency characteristics of the CMOS DA with 
and without the additional drain capacitance CD (=112 fF). As 
can be seen, NF and S22 performances are improved after the 
addition of CD. Because the parasitic capacitance at the drain 
terminal of transistors M2 is not large enough, the frequency of 
the second zero of NF and S22 is too high. This in turn results

in uneven NF and unsatisfied S22 performances over the band 
of interest. Since the addition of CD can move the second zero 
of NF and S22 to a lower frequency, the NF flatness and the S22 
performance can be enhanced. 
 
III. MEASUREMENT RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
On-wafer measurement was performed by an Agilent’s 
Vector Network Analyzer. At the bias conditions of VDD = 1.8 
V, VG1 = 1 V, and VG = 0.67 V, the bias current of each stage 
of the DA was 5.4 mA. That is, the DA consumed 29.16 mW. 
Fig. 3(a) shows the measured and simulated characteristics of 
S11, power gain (S21) and NF versus frequency of the DA. As 
can be seen, the measured results conformed well to the 
simulated ones. In addition, S11 of −5~ −17.7 dB, S21 of 
10.5±1.4 dB, and NF of 3.2±0.3 dB were achieved over the 
DC-10.5 GHz band. To the authors’ knowledge, this is one of 
the best NF ever reported for a CMOS DA or wideband LNA 
with bandwidth greater than 7.5 GHz.

where S21[1] represents the average power gain in magnitude; 
BW[GHz] represents the 3 dB-bandwidth in GHz; (NF-1)[1] 
represents the excess average NF in magnitude; and PDC[mW] 
represents power dissipation in mW. This FOM includes the 
most relevant parameters for evaluating DAs or LNAs for low-
power, high-gain, low-noise, and wideband applications. Table 
I is a summary of the implemented DC-10.5 GHz CMOS DA, 
the recently reported state-of-the-art CMOS DAs and 
wideband LNAs. As can be seen, compared with other works, 
our CMOS DA exhibits flat and high S21, one of the best NF, 
one of the best FOM, and excellent phase linearity. The results 
show the proposed DA architecture and design methodology is 
suitable for 3-10 GHz UWB or even higher frequency 
wideband communication system applications. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
We report a low-noise DC-10.5 GHz CMOS DA with 
excellent phase linearity by using the proposed RLC gate 
terminal network. The state-of-the-art results (NF of 3.2±0.3 
dB and group-delay-variation of ±13.8 ps) of the DA indicate 
that it serves well for wideband communication systems.
