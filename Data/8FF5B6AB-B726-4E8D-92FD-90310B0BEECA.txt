英文摘要 
 
The purpose of the Sub-project 3 is mainly to design and implement an 
Intelligence Overall Equipment Effectiveness (IOEE). Based on the 2nd Generation 
Generic Embedded Device (GEDII) which design and implement by Sub-project 1, 
IOEE can collect the data of machine state efficiently, and then calculate Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of every machine or its components. The proposed 
IOEE can also diagnose and predict the performance of machine, component, 
scheduling or quality by OEE data. Moreover, in this Sub-project 3, an IOEE Server 
will also be designed and implemented. The IOEE Server will collect, record and 
management the OEE of all machines and components. When some errors have been 
predicted by Intelligent Performance Evaluator (IPE) which design and implement by 
Sub-project 2. The manager can compare the prediction results with the result of 
IOEE.

三、文獻探討 
雖然機台的可用性（availability）直接影響到產出的表現，然而除了機台的
可用性之外還有其他因素也會造成機台生產績效的滑落，例如好的排程能減少改
機的次數，甚至縮短改機的時間；高規格的原料能提升產品的良率，甚至縮短加
工的時間；良好的物流管理能減少機台待料的時間，而這些都是現有的電子診斷
與維護所沒有考量到的議題。因此要提升機台生產績效除了藉由電子診斷與維護
提升機台的可用性之外，其他與機台生產相關的因素也必須做整體的考量，才能
真正提升生產的績效。 
總體設備效能（Overall Equipment Effectiveness, OEE）是一個衡量機台的理
想產出與實際產出的指標，其定義是六種損失的乘積，因為它們代表機器設備所
損失的效益。這六種損失包括：1)機器當機，2)機器設置與調整，3)機器閒置，
4)速度損失，5)不合格品，與 6)低生產率。它們又可歸類成三大類：可用度損失
(availability losses)、效率損失(efficiency losses) 、 生產率損失(yield losses)。因
此 OEE 除了考慮機台的可用度之外，還考慮了其他與生產績效相關的意圖，是
一個全面性針對機台生產績效評估的指標。 
雖然 OEE 已被普遍使用，但是 OEE 是單一機台的表現指標，要利用 OEE
來評估一機台的表現時是無法客觀的將排程相關的狀態排除的。總體設備群效能

Abstract
There are many cases in daily life and in the workplace which pose a decision problem. Some of them involve picking
the best from among multiple available alternatives. However, no single alternative works best for all performance attri-
butes. This research proposes a multiple attribute decision making (MADM) method, grey relational analysis (GRA), for
solving this kind of problem. Two cases, facility layout and dispatching rules selection problem, which have been analyzed
by data envelopment analysis (DEA), were also analyzed using the GRA procedure, in order to illustrate the use of GRA.
In the case of the facility layout problem, 18 alternative layouts and 6 performance attributes were considered. In the case
of the problem of selecting dispatching rules, 9 alternatives dispatching rules and 7 performance attributes were considered.
For the two cases examined, the results of comparisons show that GRA is eﬃcient for solving MADM problem.

1. Introduction
There are many multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems in our daily life. Diﬀerent from sin-
gle attribute decision making problem, MADM aims to select the best from the existing ‘‘alternatives’’,
‘‘options’’, ‘‘policies’’, ‘‘actions’’, or ‘‘candidates’’, by considering multiple ‘‘attributes’’, ‘‘goals’’ or ‘‘criteria,’’
which are frequently in conﬂict with each other. Therefore, how to make trade-oﬀ between these conﬂicting
attributes and then make a decision could pose a diﬃcult problem. There are several common methodologies
for MADM, such as simple additive weighting (SAW), the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal
solution (TOPSIS), analytical hierarchy process (AHP), data envelopment analysis (DEA) and so on (Yoon &
Hwang, 1995; Yang, Chen, & Hung, 2007; Yang & Hung, 2007).
The grey system theory proposed by Deng (1982) has been widely applied to various ﬁelds (Lin, Chang, &
Chen, 2006). It has been proven to be useful for dealing with poor, incomplete, and uncertain information.

The details of the proposed GRA procedure is presented below.
2.1. Grey relational generating
When the units in which performance is measured are diﬀerent for diﬀerent attributes, the inﬂuence of some
attributes may be neglected. This may also happen if some performance attributes have a very large range. In
addition, if the goals and directions of these attributes are diﬀerent, it will cause incorrect results in the analysis
(Huang & Liao, 2003). Therefore, processing all performance values for every alternative into a comparability
sequence, in a process analogous to normalization, is necessary. This processing is called grey relational gen-
erating in GRA.
For a MADM problem, if there are m alternatives and n attributes, the ith alternative can be expressed as
Yi = (yi1, yi2, . . ., yij,. . ., yin), where yij is the performance value of attribute j of alternative i. The term Yi can
be translated into the comparability sequence Xi = (xi1, xi2, . . ., xij,. . ., xin) by use of one of Eqs. 1, 2, 3.

Eq. (1) is used for the-larger-the-better attributes, Eq. (2) is used for the-smaller-the-better attributes and Eq.
(3) is used for the-closer-to-the-desired-value-yj -the-better.
2.2. Reference sequence deﬁnition
After the grey relational generating procedure using Eq. (1), (2) or Eq. (3), all performance values will be
scaled into [0, 1]. For an attribute jof alternative i, if the value xij which has been processed by grey relational
generating procedure, is equal to 1, or nearer to 1 than the value for any other alternative, that means the
performance of alternative i is the best one for the attribute j. Therefore an alternative will be the best choice
if all of its performance values are closest to or equal to 1. However, this kind of alternative does not usually
exist. This paper then deﬁnes the reference sequence X0 as (x01, x02, . . ., x0j, . . ., x0n) = (1,1, . . .,1,. . .,1), and
then aims to ﬁnd the alternative whose comparability sequence is the closest to the reference sequence.
2.3. Grey relational coeﬃcient calculation
Grey relational coeﬃcient is used for determining how close xij is to x0j. The larger the grey relational coef-
ﬁcient, the closer xij and x0j are. The grey relational coeﬃcient can be calculated by Eq. (4).
cðx0j; xijÞ ¼ Dmin þ fDmaxDij þ fDmax for i ¼ 1; 2; . . . ;m j ¼ 1; 2; . . . n ð4Þ
In Eq. (4), c(x0j, xij) is the grey relational coeﬃcient between xij and x0j, and

3.1. Problem description
An anonymous leading IC packaging company located in Kaohsiung, Taiwan provides IC packaging ser-
vices to customers worldwide. Due to rapid expansion, this company would like to assure their future plant
layout is eﬃcient in supporting production activities. To illustrate the proposed procedure, one of their exist-
ing production lines was used for this study. If the current layout is not eﬃcient, this company would like to
know what layout alternatives are eﬃcient. The experience learned from this study will provide guidelines for
future layout design.
The IC packaging process is divided into 10 departments in the case company’s existing layout. The
material ﬂow is from departments 1 to 10 sequentially, regardless of product type. The performance mea-
sures were determined in discussion with the company’s management and by applying general layout
guidelines. They are: ﬂow distance, adjacency score, shape ratio, ﬂexibility, accessibility, and maintenance.
The ﬂow distance is equal to the sum of the products of ﬂow volume and rectilinear distance between the
centroids of two departments. The adjacency score is the sum of all positive relationships between adjacent
departments. There is a positive relationship between each two consecutive departments along the process
routing. Shape ratio is deﬁned as the maximum of the depth-to-width and width-to-depth ratio of the
smallest rectangle that completely encloses the department. For a layout design problem, we would like
to minimize both the shape ratio and ﬂow distance, while maximizing adjacency score. Flexibility involves
two aspects. The ﬁrst is the capability to perform a variety of tasks under a variety of operating condi-
tions. The second is the ﬂexibility for future expansion. Accessibility involves material handling and oper-
ator paths. Finally, the maintenance issue involves the required space for maintenance engineers and tool
movement.
Spiral (1999) was used for layout generation. Flow routing was converted to a from-to-chart, which
together with departmental size then became the input for Spiral. Spiral generated a layout alternative based
on its embedded algorithm. By choosing its improvement algorithm, a three-way pairwise interchange, a large
number of alternatives were generated and ranked by ﬂow distance in ascending order. Yang and Kuo (2003)
selected 17 alternatives for further evaluation. Including the case company’s current layout, there are 18 alter-
natives in total. An example of an alternative layout is shown in Fig. 3.
Among the six performance attributes, the values of ﬂow distance, adjacency score and shape ratio are
quantitative data which can be measured from the layout design chart directly. However, the other three per-
formance attributes, ﬂexibility, accessibility and maintenance, are qualitative data which need to be evaluated
by quantiﬁcation methods. Yang and Kuo (2003) used analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for evaluating the
values of these performance attributes. The entire performance measures for the 18 layout alternatives are
shown in Table 1. Note that alternative 18 is the case company’s current layout.
Yang and Kuo (2003) adopted a DEA approach in solving the case study problem. DEA is a linear pro-
gramming-based technique which is now widely applied for the measurement of eﬃciency of many entities or
decision-making units (DMUs) whose production processes are characterized by multiple inputs and outputs
(Hibiki & Sueyoshi, 1999). The eﬃciency of a multiple input and outputs DMU may be deﬁned as a weighted
sum of its outputs divided by a weight sum of inputs and usually constrained to the interval [0, 1], as illustrated
in Eq. (6).

3.2.2. Grey relational coeﬃcient calculation
In Table 2, X0 is reference sequence. After calculating Dij, Dmax and Dmin, all grey relational coeﬃcients can
be calculated by Eq. (4). For example, D11 = j1- 0.8317j = 0.1683, Dmax = 1 and Dmin = 0, if f = 0.5, then c(x01,
x11) = (0 + 0.5 · 1)/(0.1683 + 0.5 · 1) = 0.7481. The entire results for the grey relational coeﬃcient are shown
in Table 3.
3.2.3. Grey relational grade calculation
In this case, the importance of all performance attributes were assumed to be equal. Thus the weights of the
six performance attributes were all the same (1/6). By using Eq. (5), the grey relational grade can be calculated
and is shown in column 2 of Table 4.

Fig. 4 demonstrates that the impact of the distinguishing coeﬃcient on the result of GRA is very small. In
particular, for all tested distinguishing coeﬃcients, alternative 15, 17, 11, 18 and 9, are always ranked 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5, respectively.
4. The case-study of dispatching rule selection
Production scheduling is known to be a hard combinatorial problem. It ﬁts into NP-complete problems
(Pinedo, 1995), as it can be viewed both as a static and deterministic problem. But the complications due
to the actual production environment, which are dynamic in nature and characterized by various types of
uncertainties, make the scheduling problems more complex and practically unsolvable in a deterministic
way (Lee, Piramuthu, & Tasi, 1997). The simplest approach to scheduling problems is through the adoption
of dispatching rules. However, no single dispatching rules works best for all performance attributes. In this
section a simulation case study of a dispatching rule selection problem adapted from Kadipasaoglu, Xiang,
and Khumawala (1997) was introduced. In Kadipasaoglu et al. (1997), the simulation results of eight attri-
butes of nine dispatching rules were reported. However, some of these eight attributes are not suitable for
MADM analysis. Braglia and Petroni (1999) processed these results into ﬁve attributes, and ranked these dis-
patching rules using DEA. This paper then uses the processed data from Braglia and Petroni (1999), and fol-
lows the GRA procedure to rank dispatching rules and provide a basis for decision making.
4.1. Problem description
In the research of Kadipasaoglu et al. (1997), the manufacturing system simulation model is a two stage
hybrid ﬂow shop. In stage 1, L parallel and identical machines process materials continuously. Then the out-
put of stage 1 is split into batches which are fed to the machines in stage 2. In stage 2, batches are processed in
parallel with the intent of producing more than one type of product by K machines. The hybrid ﬂow system is
shown below in Fig. 5.
Processing times for the jobs on the machines of stage 1 were generated from a uniform distribution (10,
50), and the ﬁrst stage processing times were generated from Eq. (6)

(1999) replaced (idle time - process waiting time) by idle time, and combined tardy jobs, lateness and tardiness
to form a new performance attribute, backlog cost. The detailed description of processing these attributes can
be found in Braglia and Petroni (1999). Therefore, only ﬁve performance attributes, in-processing waiting
time, idle time, queue time, dollar days and backlog cost were considered. The present research then follows
these results for the GRA procedure.
4.2. Empirical illustrations
4.2.1. Grey relational generating
All performance attributes belong to the-smaller-the-better category, and the grey relational generating
process adopted Eq. (2) for grey relational generating. The entire results of grey relational generating are
shown in Table 7.
4.2.2. Grey relational coeﬃcient calculation
In Table 7, X0 is reference sequence. After calculating Dij, Dmax and Dmin, all grey relational coeﬃcients can
be calculated using Eq. (4). The entire results for the grey relational coeﬃcient are shown in Table 8.
4.2.3. Grey relational grade calculation
In this case, the importance of all the performance attributes were assumed to be equal. Thus the weights of
the ﬁve performance attributes were all the same (1/5). By using Eq. (5), the grey relational grade can be cal-
culated and as shown in the column 2 of Table 9.
The ranking results of GRA are shown in column 3 of Table 9. This shows that the ﬁrst ranked dispatching
rule is the cost over time (COV) dispatching rule, and number 2 is SLK. The data in column 4 of Table 9 are
the results from Braglia and Petroni (1999), and show that COV and SLK are ranked equal ﬁrst as alternatives
in their method. In this case, TOPSIS and SAW were also adopted for ranking these dispatching rules and the
results are shown in columns 5 and 6 of Table 9. These two methods show COV and SLK are both the top

As opposed to DEA that often generate several frontiers as the preferred choices; the GRA can outperform
the DEA for this regard.
Another constraint for the use of DEA is its inferior performance in solving a small alternative set problem.
An insuﬃcient number of DMU’s for a DEA model would tend to rate all DMU’s 100% eﬃcient, because of
an inadequate number of degrees of freedom. A rule of thumb for maintaining an adequate number of degrees
of freedom when using DEA is to obtain at least two DMU’s for each input or output measure (Bowlin, 1987;
Yang & Kuo, 2003).
We tried to illustrate that the use of GRA in solving MADM problems is both viable and robust. In light of
the successful applications, the GRA can be applied to similar applications with conﬁdence. Hopefully, it
should provide certain insights to this research area, and then become a contribution to both literature and
practice.
On the other hand, the proposed GRA has encountered the sensitivity problem arising from the parameter
setup of the distinguish coeﬃcient. The diﬀerent distinguish coeﬃcients may lead to diﬀerent solution results.
Decision makers should try several diﬀerent distinguishing coeﬃcients and analyze the impact on the GRA
results as what have been done in the present study Furthermore, there are variant grey relational generating
and grey relational coeﬃcient calculation approaches. Although the variant approaches may not generate sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerent solutions for most instances, it should be one of the modeling considerations.
It is not easy to say which MADM approach is more reasonable and reliable for a given decision-making
problem (Chan & Wu, 1998). A more reasonable and reliable way to prioritize alternatives is to apply several
MADM approaches to the same problem, compare their results, and then make the ﬁnal decision (Wu, 2002).
In both case studies, all performance indicators were considered to be of equal weight; however, this can be
adjusted based upon a decision maker’s judgment, and diﬀerent selections will produce diﬀerent results. A pro-
posed weighting method may be the subject of future research. Even so, the results of the present study still
illustrates that the GRA procedure is simple and straightforward in calculations and prioritizing. Therefore it
is very suitable for solving MADM problems.

a b s t r a c t
Many mathematical models have been presented for the vehicle routing problem (VRP) in research
papers. Most of them assume that the travel speeds are constant, and ignore the fact that travel speeds
can change throughout the day. In this research, based on time-dependent travel speeds, an optimization
method is proposed for solving goods assignment and vehicle routing problems. Moreover, in the optimi-
zation method, the travel time calculation satisﬁes the ‘‘non-passing” property, which is ignored in most
research papers. A real case of a 3C warehousing company and a larger simulated problem are introduced
to illustrate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is efﬁcient and effective in
solving problems.

1. Introduction
Goods assignment and routing planning for a ﬂeet of vehicles to
satisfy the demand of all retail stores is a very important problem
for distribution centers. When all information about demand de-
tails from each retail store have been received, the distribution
center has to decide which goods for which retail stores should
be transported by the same vehicle, and how these vehicles should
be routed to minimize the total transportation distance or trans-
portation cost. This kind of problem is called the vehicle routing
problem (VRP).
VRP can be described as a general version of the well-known
traveling salesman problem (TSP) (Woensel, Kerbache, Peremans,
& Vandaele, 2007). When the ﬂeet size is equal to one and vehicle
capacity can be assumed inﬁnite, VRP can be considered as TSP
(Ichoua, Gendreau, & Potvin, 2003). The VRP is deﬁned as follows:
ﬁnd a set of routes of minimum length (or travel time) for a ﬂeet of
vehicles initially located at a distribution center, such that the re-
tail stores’ demands are satisﬁed and the loading limitations of the
vehicles are not exceeded (Chen, Hsueh, & Chang, 2006).
Many models proposed in the literature on VRP assume that the
travel speeds (or times) between relevant locations (distribution
centers and retail stores) are constant throughout the day (Ichoua
et al., 2003). This assumption may be far from the reality, in partic-
ular for urban areas where travel speeds (or times) typically vary
during the day due to congestion during the rush hours (Fleisch-
mann, Gietz, & Gnutzmann, 2004). In some practical cases, distri-
bution centers have a strategy to transport goods late at night or
early in the morning when trafﬁc is low and customers are few.
However, there are still many retail stores that only open when
the number of customers is potentially high, as they have to con-
sider their operating costs. The travel speeds (or times) may then
be different when these stores are open.
Research relating to time-dependent travel speeds is rare in the
literature. Beasley (1981) adapted the savings algorithm to solve
the problem in the case where two periods of the day with differ-
ent travel times are considered. Hill and Benton (1992) proposed a
parsimonious model for estimating the average travel speed when
the time-dependent VRP (TDVRP) is considered. They also pro-
posed a simple greedy heuristic for solving a TDVRP which con-
tains 210 locations and 96 time intervals. Malandrki and Daskin
(1992) presented mixed integer linear programming formulations
of the TDTSP and the TDVRP that treat the travel time functions
as step functions. Based on a nearest-neighbor heuristic, several
simple heuristic algorithms are given for solving TDTSP and
TDVRP. Malandraki and Dial (1996) presented a restricted dynamic
programming heuristic algorithm for TDTSP with a given starting
time from the depot. The heuristic is based on the exact dynamic
programming algorithm for the TSP but can solve much larger
problems than the exact algorithm. Park (2000) considered bi-cri-
teria vehicle scheduling, with time and area-dependent travel
speeds. Two conﬂicting objectives (minimization of total vehicle
operation time and minimization of total weighted tardiness) were
treated explicitly. A mixed integer linear programming formulation
was constructed for the problem and a heuristic called the

it would be possible that a vehicle departing in time interval k + 1
will arrival at retail store j earlier than the vehicle that departed in
time interval k. This causes the unreasonable ‘‘passing” situation.
If the distance between retail stores i and j is Dij, and the trans-
portation from retail stores i–j is completed in time interval k, it
follows that the transportation time is Dij
Vkij
and the arrival time is
departure time, T, plus Dij
Vkij
. However, if the transportation is exe-
cuted when the time passesWk+1, the lower bound of time interval
k + 1, the transportation speed should change to Vkþ1ij , thus the ar-
rival time is T þ Dij

a departure time T and a pair of retail stores i and j, the arrival time
can be calculated by the procedure illustrated in Fig. 4.
If two vehicles A and B depart from retail store i at Tda and T
d
b,
respectively, in time interval k, and if the arrival time of these
two vehicles to retail store j are both in time interval k. Then the
arrival time of vehicle A (Taa) and B (T
a
b) will be T
d
a þ DijVkij and
Tdb þ DijVkij. If the arrival time of these two vehicles to retail store j
are both in time interval k + 1. Then the arrival time of vehicle A
and B will be Tda þ DijVkij Wkþ1

cle A is earlier than vehicle B (Tda < T

b), then T
a
a will always be smal-
ler than Tab. Moreover, following the procedure shown in Fig. 4, it is
impossible that vehicle A will arrive in interval k + 1 and vehicle B
arrive in interval k. Therefore, the arrival time of vehicle A will
always be earlier than that of vehicle B, and the non-passing prop-
erty will always be satisﬁed.
According to the procedure shown in Fig. 4, when given a
sequence of retail stores 1, 2, . . . , s, s + 1, . . . , S, the total transporta-
tion time can be calculated in a way that satisﬁes the non-passing
property. However, every vehicle has loading limitations, and it is
impossible to satisfy all retail stores with only one vehicle. This
research proposes a procedure to calculate the total transportation
time when loading limitations are considered.
In the calculation procedure, the ﬁrst vehicle is assigned to
transport the goods requested by different retail stores, starting
from retail store 1, and proceeding through the sequence in
order. Following the sequence of retail stores, if the loading lim-
itation of the vehicle is going to be exceeded, the next retail
store will be assigned to second vehicle. In the same way, if
the loading limitation of the second vehicle is going to be
exceeded, the next retail store will be assigned to the third vehi-
cle. This procedure is applied continuously until all the retail
stores have been assigned. In addition, all vehicles start from
and end at the distribution center.
For example, take a given sequence of seven retail stores G, C, B,
D, E, F, A as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5, every circle indicates a retail
store. Moreover there are two numbers beside the circle. The ﬁrst
number indicates the sequence of the corresponding retail store,
and the second indicates the number of units requested in the cor-
responding retail store. If the loading limitation is 10, the ﬁrst three
retail stores will be allocated to Vehicle 1. If the fourth retail store
were assigned to Vehicle 1, the loading of Vehicle 1 would be ex-
ceeded. Therefore, the sequence from 4 to 7 of retail stores will
be assigned to Vehicle 2. The routings of these two vehicles are
illustrated by the arrows shown in Fig. 5.
Given the following notation, the request assignment and total
transportation time can be decided and calculated by the proce-
dure shown in Fig. 6.

another neighboring solution. By using the short-term memory of
the recent solution, the optimization routines can effectively es-
cape from local optimal solutions (Glover & Laguna, 1993). The re-
sults reported of the applications of tabu search (TS) to sequencing
type problems are remarkable and exhibit considerable robustness
(Ben-Daya & Al-Fawzan, 1998).
In this research, the proposed TS procedure started with an ini-
tial sequence, and then, using the method of pairwise-exchange,
searched new sequences. If a new sequence, Xnext, is better than
the original sequence, Xnow, the original sequence is replaced by
the new one and the new one is kept as the basis for the search
for better sequences. These successive moves will be recorded in
a tabu list for a certain number of iterations, Ttabu, which is called
the tabu tenure. All moves recorded in the tabu list are not permit-
ted when searching for new sequences, until all moves not in the
tabu list have been executed and no better sequence found. If all
moves not in the tabu list have been executed and no better se-
quence is found, all moves in tabu list will be searched. If the best

Finally a sequence D, E, F, A, G, C, B will be generated.

In this section, a real case of a 3C warehousing company prob-
lem and a larger simulated problem are introduced for experimen-
tal purposes. The results are also reported and discussed.

A case study from a well-known 3C (computer, communication
and consumer electronics) warehousing company in Taiwan is
adopted for the empirical illustration. The 3C warehousing com-
pany has almost 300 retail stores in Taiwan. Its 2007 annual sales
were over US$1.0 billion. There is a distribution center located in
the south of Taiwan which aims to satisfy the requests from 25
nearby retail stores. The locations of these 25 retail stores are
shown in Fig. 9. There are ﬁve time intervals in a day. Interval 1
is 8:00–9:00; Interval 2 is 9:00–12:00; Interval 3 is 12:00–13:00;
Interval 4 is 13:00–17:00 and Interval 5 is 17:00–19:00. Intervals
1 and 5 are rush hours in most locations, as most people go to work
and come home from work in these two time periods. Interval 3 is
another rush hour because some people take a rest and have a
lunch in the downtown area, but congestion is not as serious as
in intervals 1 and 5.
The company divides these 25 retail stores into three sets. Every
set contains 8 or 9 retail stores. Fixed routing (FR) for three vehicles
to the three sets of retail stores is the current planning strategy of
the company. In this research the loading limitations of vehicles
are set at 100, thus the request of every retail store is around
11.11–12.50 (100/9–100/8) in average. To increase the variation
of requests from each retail store, all requests for retail stores are
set by uniform distribution between 5 and 15. However, that could
cause the total request of a set of retail stores to exceed the loading
limitation of a vehicle. In order to avoid the total request of a set of
retail stores exceeding the loading limitation of a vehicle, after the
requests from all the stores have been decided by a uniform distri-
bution between 5 and 15, the request of the retail store with the
biggest quantity in a set will be reduced by one until the total de-
mand from the retail stores of the set equals the loading limitation
of the vehicles. Following this procedure, ﬁve sets of requests for
retail stores were generated. Moreover, un-loading time for all re-
tail stores were set at 20 min.
In addition to the company’s current planning strategy (FR),
tabu search with an initial solution generated by shortest distance
method (TS–SD), and tabu search with an initial solution generated
by clockwise search method (TS–CW), this research also proposes
two methods for comparison. The comparison methods assume
that the travel speed is not time-dependent and unchanged for
all time intervals. In the same way as for the search algorithms
of TS–SD and TS–CW, two other sequences can be generated. Be-
cause the travel speed is a constant, the total travel time between
any pair of retail stores will depend on travel distance. Thus the
search results can be viewed as sequences with the shortest path
(SP). These two methods will be called SP–SD and SP–CW. When
the maximum number of search iterations, m, is set as 20,000,
and tabu tenure, Ttabu, as 30, the results are shown in Tables 2
and 3.
In Table 2, the total time shown in Columns 3 and 4 are calcu-
lated by taking time-dependence into consideration for the se-
quences generated by SP–SD and SP–CW. Using a Pentium IV
3.0 GHz personal computer, the computing times are less than
1 min. The results show that TS–SD has the best performance com-
pared with the other methods, and is a 22.26% improvement over
the company’s current strategy. In addition, the search methods
with the initial sequence generation method SD can ﬁnd better
solutions than the search methods with the initial sequence gener-
ation method CW. In Table 3, the results show the total transpor-
tation distance of sequences found by different methods.
Although SP–SD and SP–CW found the sequences with shorter
transportation distances, the sequences need more transportation
time than the sequence found by TS–SD and TS–CW.
4.2. Simulation problem
For the larger simulation problem, 100 retail stores are uni-
formly located within a [0, 100]2 square. This kind of simulation
problem was also adopted in Solomon (1987) and Ichoua et al.
(2003). Ichoua et al. (2003) also provided three travel speed data
sets as shown in Table 4. For each data set, there are three travel
speed categories. All the 100 retail stores are connected by 4950
lines. Each line belongs to one travel speed category with equal
probability. It is found that data set 3 is the one with the highest
degree of time-dependency, while data set 1 is the one with the
lowest.

a b s t r a c t
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) has been addressed in many research papers. Only a few of them take
time-dependent travel speeds into consideration. Moreover, most research related to the VRP aims to
minimize total travel time or travel distance. In recent years, reducing carbon emissions has become
an important issue. Therefore, fuel consumption is also an important index in the VRP. In this research
a model is proposed for calculating total fuel consumption for the time-dependent vehicle routing prob-
lem (TDVRP) where speed and travel times are assumed to depend on the time of travel when planning
vehicle routing. In the model, the fuel consumption not only takes loading weight into consideration but
also satisﬁes the ‘‘non-passing” property, which is ignored in most TDVRP-related research papers. Then a
simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed for ﬁnding the vehicle routing with the lowest total fuel
consumption. An experimental evaluation of the proposed method is performed. The results show that
the proposed method provides a 24.61% improvement in fuel consumption over the method based on
minimizing transportation time and a 22.69% improvement over the method based on minimizing trans-
portation distances.

1. Introduction
When a distribution center receives all the information it needs
about demand from all the retail stores it supplies, a vehicle rout-
ing problem (VRP) is produced. The distribution center must ﬁnd
an optimal set of routes for a ﬂeet of vehicles initially located at
a central depot, such that the retail stores’ demands are satisﬁed
and the loading limitations of the vehicles are not exceeded (Chen,
Hsueh, & Chang, 2006). Therefore, the VRP plays an important role
in the distribution chain (Ichoua, Gendreau, & Potvin, 2003) and
this research domain has been addressed in many research papers
(Ball, Magnanti, Monna, & Nemhauser, 1995).
Most VRP-related research assumes that the travel speeds (or
times) between relevant locations (distribution centers and retail
stores) are constant (Ichoua et al., 2003). However, in real life, the
trafﬁc conditions vary throughout the day. For example, during the
rush hours in urban areas, the travel speeds are reduced substan-
tially. Therefore, some distribution centers have a strategy to trans-
port the goods to retail stores late at night or early in themorning to
avoid peak trafﬁc. But not all retail stores are open for 24 h. Due to
the operation costs, there aremany retail stores that only openwhen
the number of customers is potentially high. During opening hours,
the travel speeds are always lower and variable.
Research relating to time-dependent travel speeds is uncom-
mon in the literature (Beasley, 1981; Chen et al., 2006; Fleisch-
mann, Gietz, & Gnutzmann, 2004; Hill & Benton, 1992; Ichoua
et al., 2003; Kuo, Wang, & Chuang, 2009; Malandraki & Dial,
1996; Malandrki & Daskin, 1992; Park, 2000; Park & Song, 1997).
Only Ichoua et al. (2003) and Kuo et al. (2009) present solutions
that completely satisfy the ‘‘non-passing” property, which is also
called the ‘‘ﬁrst-in–ﬁrst-out” property. The ‘‘non-passing” property
ensures that for vehicles departing from retail store i to travel to
retail store j, an earlier departure time produces an earlier arrival
time, and vice versa. Most research that uses time-dependent tra-
vel speeds assumes that the travel speeds are ﬁxed and equal to the
speeds at the time of departure. When two vehicles depart form a
retail store at time interval k and k + 1 respectively, if the travel
speed in time interval k + 1 is higher then in time interval k, the
‘‘passing” situation can occur. Fig. 1 illustrates this point. There
are three time intervals; the speed in ﬁrst time interval is 60 miles
per hour (mph), in the second time interval is 40 mph and in the
last time interval is 80 mph. If a vehicle departs at 12:45 (in the
second time interval) then the corresponding arrival time to a re-
tail store 80 miles away is 14:45. However, if the vehicle departs
at 13:15 (in the third time interval) then the corresponding arrival
time is 14:15 and early than 14:45. Thus the ‘‘passing” situation
has occurred. For more assumptions relating to time-dependent
travel speeds, see Ichoua et al. (2003).
According to a report by the US Department of Energy (2008),
the travel speed will have a large effect on fuel consumption. When

However, if Taij > Wkþ1, that means the arrival time is in time

The transportation time and fuel consumption calculation pro-
cedure is shown in Fig. 4.
It can be shown that the transportation time is time-dependent
and satisﬁes the ‘‘non-passing” property. Thus the proposed fuel
consumption calculating procedure also satisﬁes that property.
For example, in Fig. 1 the corresponding arrival time of the vehicle
which departs at 12:45 (in time interval 2) is 14:45 ðTaijÞ. However
14:45 is larger than 13:00 (W2+1), then the T

earlier than the corresponding arrival time of the vehicle which de-
parts at 13:15. Thus the ‘‘non-passing” property is satisﬁed.
Given a routing plan, the departure time from retail store s in
the travel sequence to go to retail store s + 1, TdðsÞðsþ1Þ, can be
calculated by the procedure shown in Fig. 5 in which Ps indicates
the time taken to unload the vehicle at retail store s. The procedure
shown in Fig. 5 is used in combination with the procedure shown
in Fig. 4 to calculate the transportation time from the distribution
center to retail store with sequence s, T(0)(s), the transportation time
from retail store with sequence s to retail store with sequence s + 1,
T(s)(s+1), and the transportation time from retail store with sequence
s to the distribution center, T ðsÞð0Þ. Moreover, the procedure shown
in Fig. 5 can also be used to calculate the total transportation time
for sub-route n, Tn, and total transportation time for the entire
routing plan, TT.
2.3. Total fuel consumption calculation for routing plans
Loading weight is another important factor that affects fuel con-
sumption. The fuel consumption calculation procedure shown in
Fig. 4 only takes time-dependent transportation speed into consid-
eration. That means the fuel consumption calculated by using the
procedure shown in Fig. 4 is only suitable for an empty vehicle. As-
sume that an extra M pounds in the vehicle will increase fuel con-
sumption by p (as a percentage). When a vehicle transports
something weighing Q from retail store i to retail store j, the real
fuel consumption will be Fijð1þ pðQ=MÞÞ.
Given a routing plan, when all TdðsÞðsþ1Þ have been calculated using
the procedure shown in Fig. 5, the fuel consumption from the distri-
bution center to retail store with sequence s; Fð0ÞðsÞ, the fuel con-
sumption from retail store with sequence s to retail store with
sequence sþ 1; FðsÞðsþ1Þ, and the fuel consumption from retail store
with sequence s to the distribution center, FðsÞð0Þ can be calculated
by the procedure shown in Fig. 4. Then the total fuel consumption
for sub-routen (Fn), and total fuel consumption for the entire routing
plan (TF) can be calculated by the procedure shown in Fig. 6.
The calculation procedure in Fig. 6 calculates fuel consumption
by reversing the sequence of sub-routes, because the loading
weight of vehicles is the sum of the amounts to be delivered from
the distribution center to retail store RðeÞn . Therefore the method fol-
lows the route in reverse to retail store RðbÞn , ﬁnally ending at the
distribution center.
The overall total fuel consumption and transportation time cal-
culation model is shown in Fig. 7. It integrates the procedures from
Figs. 3–6. When given a routing plan, the model ﬁrstly uses the
procedure shown in Fig. 3 to divide the routing plan into several
sub-routes according the maximum loading weight of the vehicles,
and then ﬁnds Rbn; R
e
n and N for all sub-routes. These values are
then used in the procedures indicated in Figs. 4 and 5 to calculate
the total transportation time. The procedure of Fig. 5 can also be
used to calculate all Fij. Finally, taking the loading weight into con-
sideration, the procedure in Fig. 6 is used to calculate the total fuel
consumption.
3. Simulated annealing
It is well known that the VRP is an NP-hard problem (Zhong &
Cole, 2005). The proposed total fuel consumption and total trans-
portation time calculating model takes more variables into consid-
eration than the traditional VRP model. Therefore the proposed
TDVRP problem is more complex, and heuristic algorithms are re-
quired to solve it efﬁciently. In this study, a simulated annealing
(SA) algorithm is used to solve the proposed TDVRP problem. SA
is one of the commonly used meta-heuristics, and has been suc-
cessfully applied to solve several types of VRP (Bent & Hentenryck,
2004; Breedam, 1995; Chiang & Russell, 1996; Osman, 1993;
Tavakkoli-Moghaddam, Safaei, & Gholipour, 2006).
Kirkpatrick, Gelatt, and Vecchi (1983) ﬁrst proposed SA for
optimization problems. The SA algorithm has been widely used

In the algorithm, Zmax  Zmin is likely to be the upper bound of
DZ. Therefore, the acceptance probability for the initial tempera-
ture will be greater than 50%, and the acceptance probability for
the ﬁnal temperature will be adequately small.
The total proposed SA procedure is illustrated in Fig. 8.
4. Computational experiments
The proposed TDVRP method was validated on Solomon’s 100-
customer Euclidean problem (see Solomon, 1987). 100 retail stores
are uniformly located within a [0, 100]2 square. This kind of simu-
lation problemwas also adopted in Ichoua et al. (2003). The 100 re-
tail stores are connected by 4950 lines. For each line, there are ﬁve
categories of time-dependent travel speeds as shown in Table 1. In
the experiment, there are three speed levels – high speed (H), med-
ium speed (M) and low speed (L). High speed is assumed for trans-
port on a highway, low speed is assumed for transport in the city,
and medium speed is between the other two transportation
speeds. For example, for journeys in Category 1 the travel speed
is medium during time interval 1, low speed during time interval
2 and medium speed during time interval 3. Categories 1 and 2 in-
volve only small changes in speed, Categories 4 and 5 involve
greater changes in speed, and Category 3 involves the largest
changes in speed.
According to the ﬁve categories of time-dependent travel
speeds, this research designs four scenarios for experiment as
shown in Table 2. In the Scenario A, all 4950 lines belong to speed
Category 1 with a probability of 50% and belong to speed Category
2 with a probability of 50%. In the Scenario B, all lines belong to
speed Category 4 with a probability of 50% and belong to speed
Category 5 with a probability of 50%. In Scenario C, all lines belong
to speed Category 3 and in Scenario D, each line belongs to one of
the ﬁve categories with the same probability. It is found that the
travel speed of the entire network has the smallest change in Sce-
nario A, a larger change in Scenario B, and the biggest change in
Scenario C. In Scenario D, transportation speeds are changed within
a variable range. Therefore, Scenario A represents a transportation
system (or a city) where the travel speed is affected only slightly
over time. Scenario B represents a transportation system (or a city)
where the travel speeds on some road sections affected to a consid-
erable extent in the morning or afternoon. Scenario C represents a
transportation system (or a city) where the travel speeds on all
road sections are affected considerably in the morning and after-
noon. And Scenario D represents a transportation system (or a city)
where different road sections are affected differently according to
the time of day.
When using SA for optimizing the routing plan, a shortest dis-
tance method is adopted to generate an initial solution. The short-
est distance method starts from the distribution center and
searches for the retail stores which have the shortest path to the
distribution center. Then the method searches for the next retail
store which has the shortest path from the retail store that was
previously selected, until all retail stores have been selected.
Beside total fuel consumption and total transportation time,
this research also proposes a procedure, as shown in Fig. 9, for cal-
culating total transportation distance, TD. In Fig. 9, Dn indicates the
transportation distance of sub-route n, D(0)(s) indicates the distance
from the distribution center to the retail store with sequence s,
D(s)(s+1) indicates the distance from the retail store with sequence
s to the retail store with sequence s + 1 and D(s)(0) indicates the dis-
tance from the retail store with sequence s to distribution center.
When all Rbn; R
e
n and N have been calculated by the procedure
shown in Fig. 3, the procedure shown in Fig. 9 can be used to cal-
culate the total transportation distance.

In Table 2, each scenario generates ﬁve networks for experi-
ment. With the total number of iterations in the search set as
20,000, the algorithm proposed by Yang et al. (2005) was used
for deciding the initial temperature and ﬁnal temperature for one
network of Scenario A. The results for total fuel consumption, total
transportation time and total transportation distance are shown in
Table 3. These temperature data were then used in SA for optimiz-
ing all scenarios.
The experimental results for all criteria are shown in Table 4. In
Table 4 the data in Columns 2–4 show the results of average total
transportation time, average total fuel consumption and average
total transportation distance respectively when SA is used to min-
imize the total fuel consumption. Columns 5–7 in Table 4 show the
results when SA is used to minimize the total transportation time
and Columns 8–10 show the results when SA is used to minimize
the total transportation distance.
As shown in Table 4, when SA is used to minimize total fuel con-
sumption, a routing plan with the lowest fuel consumption can be
found. However compared with the routing plans found by mini-
mizing total transportation time and total transportation distance,
the routing plans found by minimizing total fuel consumption have
larger total transportation times and distances. The comparative
results are shown in Table 5.
In Table 5, the results show that using SA to minimize total fuel
consumption increases transportation time by between 21.96% and
23.37%, and transportation distance by between 37.96% and 40.26%
on average. However, it reduces fuel consumption by between
22.69% and 24.61% on average. When fuel consumption is seen to
be an important index, the proposed method can provide a contri-
bution to the route planning process in distribution centers.
5. Conclusions
The VRP is a very important problem for distribution centers.
This kind of research has been addressed in many research papers
but only a few deal with time-dependent travel speeds. Time-
dependent travel speeds mean that the travel speeds between a
pair of retail stores are different in different time intervals. This sit-
uation always occurs in real cases. This research proposed a model
to calculate total fuel consumption, total transportation time and
total transportation distance for the time-dependent vehicle
routing problem (TDVRP) when given a vehicle routing plan. The

The total time, equipment uptime, and productive time
were defined by SEMI [26] as shown in Fig. 1.
A change of OEE may be brought about by a change of
AE, OE, RE, or QE. AE is the product of (operation time/
total time) and (uptime/operation time). The former
(operation time/total time) is the utilization of the machine
and the latter (uptime/operation time) can be viewed as the
reliability of the machine. If the OEE changes due to a
change of AE, and the utilization of the machine is 100%,
the implication is that the reliability of the machine has
changed. OE can be viewed as an index for evaluating the
effectiveness of operation management. Good (or bad)
operation management would cause high (or low) OE. RE
is the production rate of a machine. Without any manual
adjustment to the machine, any change of RE would
probably be the result of changes in the reliability of the
machine. QE is the yield rate of a machine. It depends upon
the operator, the reliability of the machine, the quality of
material, and so on. Therefore, from a change in OEE, AE,
OE, RE, or QE, managers can not only know whether there
is a problem in the production system but can also make an
initial judgment as to what kind of problem has occurred.
However, OEE, AE, OE, RE, and QE are all primarily
used to monitor the production effectiveness of machines. If
these indices have been found to be too low, that means
losses have occurred. Therefore, any analysis would be too
late. This research proposes some methods for predicting the
values of these indices. When a low value of these indices
has been predicted, a manager can make some analysis and
then make appropriate adjustments to avoid losses and keep
these index values within a reasonable range.
There are many prediction methods. In this research, two
prediction tools are used to constitute four prediction
methods. The first tool is neural networks, and the second
tool is decision trees. Data from a group of washing
machines of a TFT-LCD manufacturing company was
introduced as a case study. Based on the collected data
from the case study company, the proposed four methods
will be used for prediction to find the most cost-effective
method. The remainder of the research is organized as
follows: The two main prediction tools—neural networks
and decision trees—are introduced in Sections 2 and 3,
respectively. Then, four prediction methods will be pro-
posed in Section 4. In Section 5, the case study of the
washing machines of a TFT-LCD manufacturing company
will be introduced. Section 6 shows the empirical results.
Finally, Section 7 presents the conclusions.
2 Neural networks
The neural network approach has been shown to be a
promising prediction tool [1–3, 15, 16, 21]. Artificial neural
networks (ANNs) are composed of interconnecting adap-
tive elements, which are intended to respond to a stimulus
in a manner not unlike the human nervous system [17].
There are three basic elements of an ANN model [9], as
illustrated in Fig. 2. They are synapses, adder, and activation
functions. Synapses are the connecting links between
neurons. Each input signal (Xi) transferred by the synapses
must be multiplied by its specific weight (Wi). Then, the
adder sums up the bias (b) and all the signals, which have

rate. If a node is replaced by its leaf and produces a tree
with a smaller error rate within the pruning confidence
interval, then the pruning process will decide the node to
be replaced. A smaller pruning confidence interval causes
more of the initial tree to be pruned, while larger values
result in less pruning. ‘Minimum cases’ means the small-
est number of cases that must be contained for each
terminal node.
In contrast with C4.5, when a decision tree has been
constructed and the decision tree makes mistakes in some
cases, C5.0 will pay more attention to those cases and
construct another decision tree. In this way, several decision
trees will be constructed. When testing a case, these
constructed decision trees will ‘vote’ according to their
classification results. The final classification result will
depend on the voting result. This procedure is called
‘boosting’. The reader can refer to Freund and Schapire
[10] for more details about the boosting algorithm.
4 Proposed prediction methods
Based on neural networks and decision trees that have been
introduced in Section 3, this research proposes four
prediction methods to predict OEE-related indices. The
first and second methods both used only neural networks,
but a different structure of training data was adopted. The
third and fourth methods both used neural networks and
decision trees for predicting, but a different data structure
was adopted for neural network training and decision tree
growing. These four methods are introduced below.
4.1 Method 1
Cybenko [6] and Hornik et al. [11] recommended that a
neural network with one hidden layer is sufficient to model
any complex system. For Method 1, the one-hidden-layer
neural network topology shown in Fig. 5 is used.
In Fig. 5, w indicates the window size. The input layer has
w input nodes: y(t), representing the current value in the time
period t; the second node, y(t-1), representing the previous
value in time period t-1; and the last node, y t  wþ 1ð Þ,
representing the previous value in time period t  wþ 1. In
total, there are w period values used for predicting the output,
y(t+1), representing the next value in time period t+1.
In general, the learning algorithms of neural networks
can optimize the weights, Wi, even if there are some inputs
that have no relationship with the outputs because the
learning algorithms can adjust the weights of the synapses
to decrease the relationship between output nodes and these
unimportant input nodes. For this reason, the window size
should be big enough to make sure that all important input
information can be considered during the learning process.
4.2 Method 2
For Method 2, a neural network with one hidden layer is
also adopted. The proposed topology of the neural network
is shown in Fig. 6.
The neural network topology shown in Fig. 6 is taken from
Chiu et al. [5]. They proposed the neural network topology
to identify the disturbance of a process. In Method 2, there
are 2w input nodes in the neural network topology. The first
w input nodes are the same as the nodes of Method 1. The
remaining w input nodes are a little different from the nodes
proposed by Chiu et al. [5] and calculated as follow:
SlopeðtÞ ¼ yðtÞ  y t  1ð Þ
Slope t  1ð Þ ¼ y t  1ð Þ  y t  2ð Þ
Slope t  wþ 1ð Þ ¼ y t  wþ 1ð Þ  y t  wð Þ
The main difference between Method 2 and the method
proposed by Chiu et al. [5] is that the last w nodes in Chiu

remaining 6 days to calculate the weekly AE. For the
remaining 51 weeks, the utilizations of the eight machines
were all 100%. Therefore, for all the 52 weeks, the values
of AE depend only on uptime.
According to the collected data, the washing speeds of
the eight washing machines are very stable; the variance of
collected RE data is quite small. Moreover, the washing
machines have no quality issues. The yields of every
washing machine are all 100%. Therefore, during the data
collection period, the reliability of the eight washing
machines is highly dependent on the AE. This research
attempts to use the past AE data to predict the machines’
future AE values by the four proposed methods. Since the
AE value can be used for judging the reliability of a
machine, if the predicted AE value of a machine is too low,
the managers have to note that and then make some
decision to maintain the machine’s reliability.
6 Empirical illustration
In this case study, the window size, w, is set as 8. If
Methods 1 and 3 are adopted, only 44 (52-8) data can be
used for training the neural network and decision tree for
each machine. If Methods 2 and 4 are adopted, only 43 (52-
8-1) data can be used for training the neural network and
decision tree for each machine. In general, these data sizes
are too small to train a neural network or a decision tree.
Because the eight washing machines are all of the same
type, this research tried to use the data from seven machines
for training the neural network and decision tree and used
the data of the remaining one machine for testing.
Therefore, there are 308 (44×7) items of training data for
Methods 1 and 3 and 301 (43×7) training data for Methods
2 and 4. As regards the testing, the last 43 data of the
remaining one machine are used as the testing data for all
methods.
6.1 Results of method 1
In the case study, Method 1 uses a neural network to
predict the AE value of the following week based on AE
values of the most recent 8 weeks. Before using the
neural network, appropriate training is necessary. In
general, different network structures and training param-
eters would result in different training results. In this
case many different structures and training parameters
have been tried, but all produced similar results. This

process (Kuo and Yang 2006)
1248 Int J Adv Manuf Technol (2010) 50:1243–1251 Author's personal copy 
6.4 Results of method 4
Method 4 used the same structure as Method 3 for
predicting the AE value of the following week. In this case
study, Method 4 used the same structures and training
parameters as Method 2 for neural network development
and used the same parameters as Method 3 for growing and
pruning the decision tree.
The predicted results of Method 4 for the 43 items of test
data are as shown in Fig. 10. The average error for the 43
items of test data is 19.65%.
In Fig. 13, it is found that the predicted values of
Method 4 have large variations. Most of the predicted
values are outside a reasonable range.
6.5 Comparison of methods
According to the average prediction error, it is found that
Methods 1, 2, and 3 have similar accuracy and are
obviously better than Method 4. However, as shown in
Figs. 10 and 11, the predicted values produced by
Methods 1 and 2 have only small variations. If Method
1 or 2 is adopted for predicting the future AE values, the
predicted values will not provide the managers any
useful information. As regards Method 3, the predicted
values, as shown in Fig. 12, are closer to the practical
data. For example, for weeks9, 17, and 29, Method 3
predicted the downward trend in AE correctly. Moreover,
for weeks21, 22, 23, and 34, Method 3 predicted the
downward trend of AE early. Therefore, Method 3 is the
most suitable for practical cases.
7 Conclusion
In this research, a group of washing machines of a TFT-
LCD manufacturing company was used as a case study.
The case study company has collected overall equipment
efficiency for managers’ reference since June 2007.
Since the availability efficiency can be used for judging
the reliability of machines, it was proposed that four
methods for predicting the machines’ reliability would be
developed, based on the collected AE data. The results
show that the predicted values of Methods 1 and 2 show
no obvious variation and no useful information can be
developed from them. Method 4 predicts AE values
which have larger variation. However, the range exceeds
the reasonable range. As regards Method 3—a combina-
tion of a neural network and a decision tree based on the
previous eight AE values—the predicted values have
appropriate variation within a reasonable range and the
method always provides useful information for managers
to make decisions. Therefore, for the TFT-LCD washing
machine system, Method 3 is most suitable for practical
application.

Equipment reliability is very impartment to the production performance. Overall 
equipment efficiency (OEE) is a metric that common used to evaluate the equipment 
performance. However, OEE not only takes the equipment reliability but also production 
environment in consideration. In this research, another two equipment metrics E and net 
equipment efficiency (NEE) are introduced. A simulation model was used for collecting 
equipment state and then calculates all three performance metrics immediately. 
According to the result, it is found that E or NEE would be better alternatives for 
manager to monitor or improvement their equipment reliability. 
1.   Introduction 
The investment of equipments in electronic industry is very large. For 
semiconductor factory example, a 300 mm fabrication unit costs more than 
US$2 billion [1], and the investment of equipment approximately occupies 75% 
[2]. Therefore, how to effectively increase the equipment effectiveness and 
availability has become a very important task and key factor for gaining profits 
[3]. 
Before increase the equipment effectiveness and availability, it is needed to 
have an appropriate index for measuring the equipment effectiveness and 
availability. Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is a simple and clear overall 
metric, managers appreciate such an aggregated metric instead of many detailed 
metrics [4]. 
The concept of OEE was proposed by Nakajima [5]. It is a quantitative 
metric for measuring the productivity of individual production equipment in a 
附錄四
2.   Equipment performance metric 
In addition to OEE, this research also introduces two other equipment 
performance metrics; named E and NEE (Net equipment efficiency). Due to 
these three metrics were proposed individually by using different definition of 
equipment states. According to [4], [7] and [10] the equipment states have been 
redefined as illustrated in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Equipment states 
The definitions of the states are as follow. 
1. Non-scheduling state: Equipment is not scheduled to be utilized in 
production, such as unworked shifts, weekends, and holidays. 
2. Scheduled down state: Equipment is not available to perform its 
function due to planned downtime event. This state includes the 
following activities: production test preventive maintenance, and setup. 
3. Unscheduled down state: Equipment is not in a condition to perform 
its intended function due to unplanned downtime event, e.g., 
Maintenance delay, repair, change of consumables or chemicals, and 
out-of-spec input. 
4. Engineering state: Equipment is in a condition to perform its function 
but is operated to conduct engineering experiments. The engineering 
state includes activities as: process engineering, equipment 
engineering and software engineering. 
5. Standby state: Equipment is in a condition to perform its intended 
function but is not operated. The standby state includes the following 
In order to compare the three metrics which was introduced above, a simulation 
tool, Extend [12], was used for simulating a single machine. The simulation 
model has a hierarchical programming structure as shown in Fig. 2.
Figure 2. Simulation interface 
For every simulation run, the equipment state can be update to an Excel file 
immediately. Therefore, all three metrics can also be calculated simultaneously. 
Moreover, in the simulation model, some parameters can be adjusted to analysis 
their impact to the three introduced metrics. These parameters propose to 
express different production environment. The details are described as follow: 
1. Mean time between failures (MTBF): The parameter is used to express 
the reliability of machine. A machine with bigger MTBF means that 
the machine is more reliable.  
2. Inter arrival time (IAT): The parameter is used to express the time 
between a material’s arrival and that of the next part [13]. If a 
production environment has a big inter arrival time that means the 
machines always standby and wait input material to produce. Thus, in 
this research, inter arrival time is used to express the good or bad 
scheduling. If the inter arrival time is big, means the schedule is bad, 
vice versa. 
3. Product mix (PM): When different materials have to be produced 
sequentially by a same machine, setup time is required. In the 
simulation model, product mix is used to express the number of 
material type and their ratio. When generates a material, its type will

4.   Conclusion 
This research introduced three equipment performance metrics OEE, E and 
NEE. A simulation model was used for collecting equipment state and then 
calculates all performance metrics immediately. According to the result, it is 
found that E and NEE are more sensitive than OEE. Although OEE is 
commonly used in industrial, it depend upon utilization, is not a real equipment 
metric. For industries which want to monitor or improve their equipment 
reliability, E or NEE would be better alternatives.

Simulation metamodel development using 
Abstract—Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is widely used 
in industry. OEE is the combination of availability efficiency 
(AE), operation efficiency (OE), rate efficiency (RE) and quality 
efficiency (QE). In general, OEE, AE, OE, RE or QE are only 
calculated as part of a management consultancy exercise. In the 
present research, a group of washing machines from a 
TFT-LCD manufacturing company are used for the case study. 
Because AE is strongly related to the reliability of a machine, 
this research aims to use collected AE data for predicting the 
reliability of the machine. Four methods are proposed for 
predicting the machine’s reliability. By comparing with two 
common prediction method-moving average and exponential 
smoothing, the results show that the combination of neural 
networks and decision trees based on the previous eight AE 
values have best performance in predicting the reliability of 
TFT-LCD washing machines.  
I. INTRODUCTION
he investment of equipments in electronic industry is 
very large. For semiconductor factory example, a 300 
mm fabrication unit costs more than US$2 billion [1], and the 
investment of equipment approximately occupies 75% [2]. 
Therefore, how to effectively increase the equipment 
effectiveness and availability has become a very important 
task and key factor for gaining profits [3]. 
Before increase the equipment effectiveness and 
availability, it is needed to have an appropriate index for 
measuring the equipment effectiveness and availability. 
Overall equipment efficiency (OEE) is a simple and clear 
overall metric, managers appreciate such an aggregated 
metric instead of many detailed metrics [4]. 
The concept of OEE was proposed by Nakajima [5]. It is a 
quantitative metric for measuring the productivity of 
individual production equipment in a factory [6]. Three 
important factors – availability (availability efficiency), 
performance (operational efficiency and rate efficiency), and 
quality (quality efficiency) are taken into account. By 
definition [7], OEE can be measured as follow: 
OEE = AE × (OE × RE) × QE (1)

The total time, equipment uptime and production time was 
defined by [8] and as show in Fig. 1. 
In general, when the reliability of a machine has been 
trending down, the OEE of the machine will trend down 
simultaneously. The reasons could be 1) the MTTF (mean 
time to failure) become shorter or MTTR (mean time to repair) 
become longer, then cause the AE to trend down; 2) the 
production speed of the machine become slower, then cause 
the RE to trend down; or 3) more and more bad output have 
been produced due to the machine under unusual condition 
then cause QE become lower. Therefore, if the AE, RE or QE 
of a machine have been trending down, it can be considered 
that the reliability of the machine would possible have 
became worse. As regards the OE, it indicates the operation 
performance when the machines under good condition. Only 
engineering experiment or standby could influence OE value.  
OEE have been widely adopted for evaluating company’s 
investment of production equipments. Higher OEE means 
higher productivity and faster return on investment. However, 
when the reliability of machines have been trending down

In this research, the whole AE data collection period was 
divided into many time windows. For every time window, the 
collected data include pass AE data and the latest AE data. 
Such as shown in Fig. 4.  The pass AE data can be view as 
training input vectors and the latest AE data can be view as 
the corresponding target value. Therefore supervised learning 
was selected for AE prediction. An algorithms named error 
propagation which is the most widely used supervised 
learning algorithm for multilayer perceptions [10] is used.  
III. DECISION TREE
A decision tree can be defined as a map of the reasoning 
process. It describes a data set by a tree-like structure. 
Decision trees are particularly good at solving classification 
problems [13]. In this research, decision tree is adopted for 
classified the trend (up or down) of future AE value while the 
neural network is adopted for predicting the change volume 
(a positive number) of future AE value. The final prediction 
value will be the combination of the results of decision tree 
and neural network. 
A decision tree consists of nodes, branches and leaves. As 
shown in Fig. 5, the top node is called the root node. The tree 
always starts from the root node and grows down by splitting 
the data at each leave into new node. 
There are many methods to select a particular split these 
methods also called decision tree algorithms. Different 
decision tree algorithms will grow different decision tree and 
cause different classification accuracy. Decision tree 
algorithms can be represented as a combination of specific 
splitting criteria and the corresponding pruning criteria for 
pruning the tree to avoid overfitting [15].  
C5.0 is a well-know decision algorithm, which is an 
improved version of C4.5 [14] is adopt in this research. The 
C5.0 algorithm works by splitting the sample based on the 
field that provides the maximum entropy or information gain. 
Moreover, when a decision tree have been constructed. If the 
decision tree make mistakes on some cases. C5.0 will pay 
more attention to these cases and construct second decision. 
Follow the same way, several decision tree will be 
constructed. When testing a case, these constructed decision 
trees will “vote” according to their classification results. This 
procedure is called “boost.” 
IV. CASE STUDY
TFT LCD manufacturing processing consists of three basic 
processes, TFT fabrication, liquid crystal (LC) assembly and 
module assembly processes as shown in Fig. 6. The TFT 
fabrication process is very similar to semiconductor wafer 
fabrication, but it is much simpler [11]. The process of LC 
assembly is combining TFT and color filter (CF) which 
usually purchased from outside vendor, than scribing and 
break, finally filling LC and form panels. Module assembly 
combines a panel with other components to form the final 
product (called module or monitor). Reader can refer to [12] 
for more detail manufacturing process. 
In the first manufacturing process, TFT fabrication, the 
bare glasses have to be cleaned by washing machine. In the 
case study company, there are nine washing machines. Since 
June 2007, the case study company has collected AE, OE, RE 
and QE for the nine washing machines weekly. OEE was then 
calculated for managers to evaluate the performance of this 
workstation. This research collected these data for 52 weeks. 
According to the collected data, it is found that the washing 
speed of these nine washing machines are very stable and 
result small change of RE value for every week. Besides, 
washing machines have no quality issue. The QE of every 
washing machine are all 100%. Therefore, only AE data were

In Fig. 8, it is found that the prediction range of the 
proposed hybrid neural network and decision tree is similar to 
the real AE data. That means that if the reliability of the 
machines are going to trend down seriously, it would have 
higher possible to predicting this kind of situation. Therefore, 
the proposed hybrid neural network and decision tree is more 
suitable for practical application. 
VI. CONCLUSION
In this research a group of washing machine of a TFT-LCD 
manufacturing company is used for the case study. The case 
study company has collected overall equipment efficiency 
(OEE) for managers’ reference since June 2007. Since the 
availability efficiency (AE) can be used for judging 
machines’ reliability. This research proposed two 
methods-neural network and hybrid neural network and 
decision tree- for predicting the machines’ reliability based 
on the collected AE data. The results show that the hybrid 
neural network and decision tree method only have little 
outperformance than neural network, moving average and 
exponential smooth in prediction error. However, it have 
obviously bigger prediction rang while other three methods 
always predict AE value in a small rang. That means the 
prediction value of other three methods is not sensitive to the 
former AE values. If the machines’ reliability are going to 
trend down seriously, the hybrid neural network and decision 
tree method can predict more approximate AE values for 
manager to make decision. Therefore, the proposed hybrid 
neural network and decision tree is more useful for practical 
application.

In recent years, people have started to realize the 
importance of environmental protection, and in 
particular the problem of global warming. 
Consequently, many governments have started to 
view decreasing carbon emissions as a priority. Green 
transportation is one of the policies that is relevant to 
these efforts. In this research, a model is proposed for 
 Abstract - This article intends to discuss the possibility 
of how to quickly improve the function of adaptive 
prediction direction for scenario analysis (SA) in 
technology-intensive industries. Therefore, this study 
is based on SA theory that combines the technology 
life cycle (TLC) viewpoint with the goal-oriented 
properties of path analysis model (PAM) to build an 
adapted SA for the purpose of dynamic technology 
forecasting. Using the goal-oriented properties of 
PAM, the adapted SA can quickly evaluate changes in 
the technical development of a market’s dynamic 
schedule and can identify the gap between 
expectations and reality. This study proposes an 
adapted SA that allows the generation of both 
qualitative and quantitative scenarios that can be used 
as a helpful planning tool for dynamic assessment.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 The traditional forecasting method mainly adopts 
scenario analysis (SA), the Delphi method and technology 
life cycle (TLC) as its technology forecasting tools. This 
article intends to discuss the possibilities for quickly 
improving the function of adaptive prediction direction 
for SA in technology-intensive industries. 
 
Chatha, Ajaefobi & Weston used TLC to make a 
market trend forecast and a TLC transformation schedule 
plan and also used technical development strategy as 
evidence for business process reengineering [1]. van der 
Heijden argued that the scenario planner alternates 
intuitive exploration of a situation with rational analysis 
and forecasting in an iterative way until a satisfactory 
description of the future has been derived [2].  
 
Both TLC and Delphi are single-point forecasting 
methods [3]. In examining future R&D market 
innovations and the dynamic development of technical 
diffusion, Li, Runger, & Tuv did not engage in a single-
point exploration of technical innovation, but rather 
combined several scenario dimensions to draw an outline 
of an SA of uncertainty envelopment curvy dynamic time 
[4]. Single-point forecasting methods are easily used for 
industries that lack the complexity of technology-
intensive industires. However, single-point forecasting 
methods are likely to neglect potential market and social 
factors, resulting in technology development strategy bias 
and poor forecasts of market trends in technology-
intensive industries. Moreover, these methods lack multi-
dimensional scenarios in their analysis of future market 
structure. 
 
Scenario building is examined as a way to turn 
intuitive knowledge of a problematic situation into clear 
research questions that may be explored by systems 
analysis and forecasting. The SA technology forecasting 
model is applicable to markets with uncertain industrial 
explanations, and it expands the technology forecasting 
model of a single field through scenario planning 
according to the changes of specified industrial technical 
demands. The market trend impulse accompanies the 
development of the social economy and the orientation of 
customer demands. If forecasting is only performed on 
key samples according to the data of the present 
development status, while changes in market demand 
time-effectiveness and technical development trends that 
are not taken into account, the changes in market 
development and customer demands may be neglected. 
Therefore, the technology forecast may fail, and SA may 
not be able to be used well enough for dynamic 
assessment. 
 
The SA will use an uncertain envelope curve to 
draw an outline of the scenario dimension, which will 
then be used as the reference for exploratory problems 
and can effectively deduce the future developmental 
trends and technology forecasting models for the relevant 
fields. However, van der Heijden proposed in “Scenarios 
and Forecasting: Two Perspectives” factors that inspired 
this study [2]. The paper presented a more elaborate 
explanation of scenarios and forecasting. It inspired us to 
rethink the purpose of scenarios and forecasting. A proper 
scenario approach helps us to negotiate the boundary line 
between the predictable and the uncertain in a more 
efficient manner. Are single-point forecasting methods 
i.e., both TLC and Delphi, proper approaches in 
technology-intensive industries? If not, how about the SA 
method? This possibility seemed worthy of further 
investigation. 
 
According to the brief review above, single-point 
forecasting methods were likely to neglect potential 
market and social factors, resulting in technology 
development strategy bias and poor forecasts of market

III.  RESULTS 
 
A.  Adapted scenario analysis model 
 
 Tushman & O’Reilly [9] proposed the TLC theory 
that describes the continuous technology development 
cycle, as shown Figure 2. The four periods in the top left 
corner of Figure 2 represent the TLC. Period 1 is the 
technology discontinuity period; period 2 is the 
fermentation period; period 3 is the dominant design 
period, while period 4 is the continuity improvement 
period. Details are as follows: 
 
At the starting stage of the TLC, when new 
technology has potential over old technology, the old and 
new technologies coexist and form the period of 
technology discontinuity. At this stage, new technology is 
starting to shine, but it has not outperformed the old 
technology. The next stage is the fermentation period, in 
which the performance and commercialization of the new 
technology is more obvious. Many companies rush 
investment into the research and development of the new 
technology with the hope to dominate the specs of 
mainstream designs and thus create a highly competitive 
phenomenon. It is a stage of competitiveness. 
 
Then the third stage is initiated, the dominant 
design period, where the companies with technological 
advantages integrate the standard specs for the new 
technology. The last stage is the continuity improvement 
period. In this stage, all companies focus on the 
improvement of processes, the increase of capacity and 
quality and the reduction of cost with incremental 
technological innovations. This fourth stage is awaiting 
the next technology breakthrough and the starting of the 
next technology discontinuity period for a new TLC.  
 
According to the viewpoint of four cycles 
characterized by TLC, this study proposed four 
propositions to explain the goal orientation of SA. These 
four propositions are labeled as scenario outcomes that 
depend on a key decision factor and an external driving 
force, as shown in Fig. 2. 
 
 Fig. 2.  Scenario Development with Goal-orientation of Adapted SA. 
 
The traditional SA integrates a key decision factor 
(KDF) and external driving force to produce the scenario 
of the technical development. This study chooses four 
scenario outcomes: 1.embryonic period, 2. low growth 
period, 3. high growth period, 4. mature period.  
 
In traditional SA, these four scenario outcomes 
present the scenario that may be produced in the future, 
and respectively have a suitable technology development 
strategy. The adapt SA receive and carry on the scenario 
outcomes of the traditional SA, further connect four 
outcomes by the characteristic of PAM the linear path 
programming to form a goal orientation structure and then 
inquire into the process of the technical development to 
face the different scenario replies to the scenario 
development (SD). The adapt SA can describe the 
complete technical development process to planning 
technology development strategy that overcome the risk 
of traditional SA single-point forecast paradigms and their 
obvious drawbacks in technology-intensive industries. 
 
Despite the fact that PAM can overcome the lack of 
goal orientation of an SA, this study is not without 
limitations. There are three limitations as follows: The 
first limitation concerns the procedure for conducting an 
adapted SA. The KDF and external driving force must be 
combined to build scenario outcomes at the beginning, 
and then the characteristic of PAM to develop the trend of 
an SD must occur. The second limitation concerns the SD 
sequence and the discussion period of an SD. According 
to the viewpoint of four-cycle TLC, the SD has four

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for 
95% of Taiwan’s industrial structure. Their main feature 
is horizontal organization, which allows quick responses 
to market needs. Taiwan’s SMEs can maintain a niche 
market in the global supply chain as long they embrace 
key technologies. However, their disadvantage in 
confronting global competition is a lack of R&D 
resources and a lack of sustainability. Is there a suitable 
resolution for SMEs wishing to raise capital for large-
scale R&D investment other than publicly issuing stock or 
shares? 
II.  METHODOLOGY-Case Study 
Taiwan’s R&D Intermediary Market
The primary purpose of the open business model 
(OBM) is to structure an integrated collaboration model 
of external resources to create the greatest economic 
benefits for organizations. Increasing the flexibility of 
corporate innovation resources to accommodate dynamic 
markets promotes organizational competitiveness. 
Chesbrough (2006) believed that the success of a 
corporation is no longer dependent on added value, but on 
the more important strategic task of structuring an 
innovative value business model [1]. Regarding the value-
added transformation case of Taiwan’s ODMs, this article 
shows how the division of innovation labor can help 
ODM industries create new competitive advantages using 
the example of Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research 
Institute (ITRI) as the supplier and E-SUN (E-SUN 
TECHNOLOGY CO.,LTD.) as the recipient. 
ITRI: Taiwan’s Innovation Engine 
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) was 
established in 1973 – a national research organization 
that serves to strengthen the technological 
competitiveness of Taiwan. ITRI has three mission 
statements: first, to expedite the development of new 
industrial technology; two, to aid in the process of 
upgrading industrial technology techniques; and three, to 
establish future industrial technology. However, in order 
to face a new economic era and serving as a nation's 
premiere technology research institute, ITRI must 
transform Taiwan's research capability from a follower
to a pioneer in order to provide major advantage and

The OBM transforms innovation and technology into 
economic results. Using a combination of innovative 
strategies and continuously integrating internal and 
external resources, the OBM promotes corporate 
competitiveness, establishes a network of collaboration 
relationships, and forms intercommunication platform 
models between corporations and corporations, and 
between corporations and research institutes. There are 
two benefits to using OBM business model innovations: 1. 
Creating Value (where the value chain occurs via the 
process of transforming raw materials to end users); 2. 
Capturing Value (where unique resources generated by 
the value creation process enhance the competitive 
advantages of the corporation).  
Lee (2001) indicated that an innovative division of 
labor and effective coordination and margin sharing in the 
value chain is only possible with effective information 
sharing and a resource integration platform [2]. The 
innovative OBM strategy moves key techniques and 
intellectual property rights from upstream suppliers in the 
intermediary market to downstream suppliers. By using 
intermediary markets, the OBM orient business models 
toward corporate intellectual property rights. These 
different revenue sources create higher economic benefits 
for innovation. Additionally, leads in external techniques 
and resources during R&D can effectively reduce 
innovative R&D cost, saving funds and time, as Fig. 1 
shows. 
Fig. 1.  Profit from OBM in Taiwan’s ODM perspective.
Lichtenthaler (2008) believed that corporations will 
incur large R&D costs to meet the needs of their target 
markets [3]. Therefore, corporations need external 
resources to make up for the shortcomings of internal 
corporate techniques. By exchanging unused technology 
with external corporations, a company can form an 
interactive collaborative network. In the past, intellectual 
property management did not consider the link between 
intellectual property rights, corporate innovation 
procedures, and business models. Rising NPD costs and 
decreasing TLCs have reduced the profitability of R&D 
investment in closed business models. 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
 A corporation in the ODM industry that wants to 
promote OBM effectively can follow the steps listed 
below: 1. Control corporate operating and profit models; 2. 
Find the market orientation of the industry and identify 
any differences between internal abilities and the external 
market; 3. Infuse innovation activities into the corporate 
culture and business model; 4. Rethink how to integrate 
external resources to reduce internal resource 
consumption and create growth opportunities; 5. Integrate 
suppliers and customers into the value chain. 
What the ODM Industry Can Learn From Taiwan 
During the post 1990’s, Taiwan’s ODM industry was 
headed in two directions: ODMs and self-owned brands. 
The ODM industry continues to attempt orient to reduce 
production costs and advance R&D efficiency via 
strategic alliances. In the face of the rapid growth China’s 
OEMs and the severe competition that they pose to the 
Taiwanese development of an ODM model, Taiwan’s 
ODMs can still retain their competitiveness using the 
division of innovation labor. Taiwan’s success originates 
from effectively integrating external R&D resources to 
decrease R&D time using the division of innovation 
labor in the ITRI, as Fig. 1 shows. The ITRI effectively 
structures the intellectual property intermediary market 
and technology transfers, using R&D selling/transferring 
resources to overcome the lack of R&D resources are 
Taiwan’s ODMs. From this article, managers may gain 
insights into the division of innovation labor for the 
SMEs ways to integrate these insights into their managing. 
V.  CONCLUSION 
 In the traditional closed business model, the operating 
efficiency of the ODM industry has been impacted by 
both the rise of innovative R&D costs and shortening of 
the revenue period. The new OBM strategy can overcome 
the shortcomings of costly R&D in the traditional 
business model. The case study in this paper shows that 
there are four new profit sources in the OBM using the 
division of innovation labor. These profit sources include 
the following: 1. The integration of internal and external 
R&D resources to reduce R&D costs; 2. The innovative 
division of labor, using external R&D resources to reduce 
internal costs and time; 3. The sale/transfer of patents; 4. 
The authorize of patents. The purposes of 1 and 2 are to 
integrate external resources, and, through industry-
academy association, to shorten R&D time and decrease 
costs. This approach further achieves the dual goals of 
cost reduction and improved R&D production. 
In the traditionally closed regional economic model, 
corporations will have a competitive advantage as long as 
they surpass their own achievements. However, in today’s 
open global economic model, only the acquisition of 
balance in the industrial supply chain and fulfilling the 
needs of the intermediary market can be counted as a

methods lack multi-dimensional scenarios in their 
analysis of future market structure. 
 
Godet pointed out that high-tech industrial sectors 
are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict because of 
the fact that characteristics of technology-intensive 
industries in TLC circulate quickly [5]. Facing a 
technology environment in which there is rapid 
circulation, making improvements in the functioning of 
adaptive prediction direction quickly will become a key 
factor in the decrease of prediction bias. van der Heijden  
thought that the SA iterative approach is akin to action 
research, and aimed at increasing an understanding of 
systems that are too complex to be understood by taking 
them apart [2]. The scenario planner alternates intuitive 
exploration of the situation with rational analysis and 
forecasting in an iterative way until a satisfactory 
description of the future has been derived. 
 
This study does not agree that Easen and 
Wilcockson suggestion that intuition may only be 
understood as an irrational process [6]. Replacing the 
term with non-structural process better and more clearly 
presents the problem of the intuitional decision-making 
process. In addition, the intuitional non-structural decision 
process is too difficult for non-decision makers to follow. 
 
However, SA requires the adaptive factor to allow a 
consideration of more concrete current phenomena in the 
real world in order to predict future outcomes to fit 
customer’s needs in technology-intensive industries. 
Despite such forecasting insights, SA does not appear to 
be an effective method, or structural process, for 
implementing dynamic technology forecasting in 
technology-intensive industries. 
 
No one has ever given a satisfactory explanation of 
why SA cannot be used effectively for dynamic 
evaluation. The question of how to quickly improve the 
function of adaptive predictive direction for SA is most 
worthy of attention. This research suggests that the 
function of goal orientation can have a reference and can 
help focus a decision focus while implementing dynamic 
technology forecasting. Therefore, this study is based on 
SA theory and intends to combine the TLC viewpoint 
with the goal-oriented property of path analysis model 
(PAM) to build an adapted SA for dynamic technology 
forecasting. 
 
The purpose of this research is to use PAM to obtain 
the correction factors for adapted scenario analysis 
technology forecasting in order to improve SA’s lack of 
goal orientation, which prevents it from correctly forecast 
technological dynamic market demands. This study will 
construct technology development strategy using SA and 
will integrate the adapted factor of PAM’s goal 
orientation property in order to connect scenario 
dimensions in a series that will portray future changes in 
technical development trends. 
 
II.  METHODOLOGY 
 
 The adaptive factor PAM was used in this study 
to obtain the correction factors for adapted scenario 
analysis technology forecasting in order to improve SA’s 
lack of goal orientation, which prevents it from correctly 
forecasting technological dynamic market demands. In the 
spreading of scenario data, one can create a goal 
orientation to guide the development of scenario data 
construction by integrating PAM. When the goal 
orientation is applied to the dissemination of the dynamic 
information scenario dimension, scenario forecasting may 
be conducted with regard to the key performance index of 
the technology development strategy. Moreover, it can 
overcome the shortcomings that prevent SA from being 
used for the dynamic assessment of market trends. 
 
This research introduces a PAM, which is 
characterized by goal orientation, to the spreading flow of 
scenario data. In addition, the serial-connected scenario 
data development could be used for the dynamic schedule 
transformation assessment of technology development 
strategy, and could be developed into a technology 
development strategy forecasting model. The adapted 
scenario analysis model can improve the goal orientation 
of SA so that it can connect the scenario development in a 
series to work as the basis for dynamic technical 
development assessment. 
 
The traditional SA aims at possible results of the 
technical development predicting how to carry on a 
strategy planning. Choosing 2~4 scenario outcomes is 
used as a strategy planned by the uncertain outcomes of 
the SA. The adapted SA then focuses on each process of a 
technical development that all means take place. Using 
the characteristic of PAM for linear programming links 
each scenario outcome to build a goal orientation 
structure and then inquires into the process of the 
technical development to address the different scenario 
responses to the strategy plan. 
 
This study summarized the SA steps from SRI (1996) 
[7] and Chen & Chiou [8]. The combination of the TLC 
viewpoint and the PAM goal orientation property is 
illustrated in Fig. 1. 
 
 
 
 
to the viewpoint of four-cycle TLC, the SD has four 
sequences including the embryonic period, low growth 
period, high growth period, and the mature period. We 
don’t discuss the decline period of the SD in this study. 
The last limitation is rooted in the fact that the paths of 
the SD don’t have interaction in this study. 
 
IV.  DISCUSSION 
 
Technical innovation and strategic planning are the 
major sources of competitive advantage in technology-
intensive industries. Technology development strategy 
must be equipped with an adjustment function to 
compensate for the ever-changing market trends, statutes 
and patents. Through the goal-oriented property of PAM, 
the adapted SA model used in this study linked the 
scenario dimensions to conduct the analysis. The R&D 
department can integrate technological advancement with 
customer demand to shorten the R&D period and reduce 
risks. Thus, it gains a competitive edge by facilitating 
technical innovation and strategic planning. The adapted 
SA model used in this research was able to analyze the 
dynamic market scenario dimension and analyze 
industrial trends in addition to mastering TLC.  
 
According to the above discussion, the adapted SA 
model can connect historical information to future 
developments, as well as assist in organizing and 
forecasting such developments through historical scenario 
data. The adapted SA can quickly evaluate the change in 
the technical developments of a market’s dynamic 
schedule by utilizing the goal-oriented property of PAM 
and can identify the gap between expectations and reality. 
In addition, it can also construct future development 
models based on the viewpoint of TLC four cycles and 
diffuse, as well as apply, the forecasting model to future 
technical innovation cycles. 
 
V.  CONCLUSION 
 
 This study is based on SA theory used to combine the 
TLC viewpoint with the goal-oriented property of PAM to 
build an adapted SA for dynamic technology forecasting. 
The adapted SA model intends to achieve technology 
development strategy dynamic assessment and may be 
offered to various R&D departments as a reference for 
improved technology development strategy. The 
framework proposed in this study introduced PAM with 
goal orientation into the development process of the 
scenario data. This model was used for the development 
of scenario data as a basis for the dynamic assessment of 
technology development strategy, which is necessary to 
grasp the developmental trends in the market and can 
enable R&D departments to integrate technological 
development and market demand.

valuable patent combination and brand new IP 
application format and opportunities. Hence, ITRI would 
fashion influential technologies that would enlarge the 
real benefits for various industries. 
New Ventures: In order to advance commercialization, 
ITRI has established an open communication platform 
between various technology sectors and investment 
companies to develop emerging technology businesses. 
As of 2004, ITRI has helped founding more than 150 
companies (including spin-offs), and as more high 
growth potential technologies emerge, ITRI will 
endeavor to commercialize those technologies. 
Open Lab and Incubation: ITRI’s Open Lab and 
Incubation program funds and support aspiring 
technology start-up to make ITRI its home for research 
and development. Our main mission is to advance 
Taiwan’s industrial prowess by providing technology 
companies on a grassroots level. ITRI makes available 
all its technological know-how and resources to provide 
for start-up’s software and hardware demands. 
Furthermore, ITRI provides research, industry 
relationship, patents, legal, and other forms of assistance 
to provide real experience and energy. In the past few 
years, 238 manufacturers with 6,350 employees have 
made ITRI its home, and 130 of those manufacturers had 
transformed into new businesses with 35 now housed in 
Hsinchu Science Park; in all, more than 44 billion NTD 
are invested into start-up and research. 
There have been many achievements in R&D and 
technology transfer: Take for example in 2001 when the 
ITRI acquired 1075 approved patents, an average of 3 
patents per day. In the same year, in cooperation with 339 
enterprises for technology development, 471 companies 
accepted technology transfers from ITRI. In 2005, 663 
technologies were transferred to 581 companies, which 
drove 272 investment projects in the field, and promoted 
many innovative enterprises. Additionally, the average 
yearly technology service provided by ITRI included 
more than 30 thousand enterprises. For Taiwan’s SMEs, 
the ITRI is like an R&D center that helps when there is a 
lack of R&D ability, as indicated in the Fig. 1. 
It even establishes the Taiwan Technology Marketplace 
(TWTM) with regards to technology transfer management 
of the added value of intellectual property rights by 
providing a patent trading platform. That is the 
intermediary market mechanism emphasized in the OBM. 
It is a platform that allows the intellectual property 
suppliers (sellers) and the demanders (buyers) to interact. 
The experts have assessed all promoted patent portfolios, 
and the classifications of the patents have been verified by 
the experts with regards to current law.  
The promotion of patent portfolios in response to 
corporate needs often produces high quality patents that 
are reliable for all. It not only allows the corporation 
(buyers) to collect information and quickly inquire about 
the intellectual property and the information they’re 
interested in, like transaction terms, price reference and 
draft contract, but patent sellers, like corporations, schools 
or research institutes, can also promote their intellectual 
property , resulting in greater trading outcomes. For more 
than three decades ITRI has facilitated technology lead-in, 
talent cultivation, provision of information, spin-off 
companies, incubation centers, technology services and 
technology transfers, all of which play a decisive role in 
the industrial development and competitiveness of 
Taiwan’s SMEs. 
 
Innovative Division of Labor of E-SUN 
E-SUN is one of the enterprises involved in the Two 
Trillion & Twin Star Industries Program sponsored by 
the Taiwanese government, which promotes flat-panel
display production equipment and standard mechanical
interface equipment. When it was established in 1978, E-
SUN was an OEM for Hitachi in charge of CRT 
production, which was the key technology that spurred E-
SUN to move to the panel industry. In 1986, E-SUN 
officially moved from the panel industry to researching 
and developing LCD production equipment. In 1995, it 
began industry-academy cooperation with the Mechanical 
and Systems Research Laboratories (MSRL) of the ITRI, 
which greatly advanced E-SUN’s R&D technology and 
innovative products. Using excellent precision mechanical 
process technologies, they developed 8-inch and 12-inch 
wafer containers in association with the MSRL, acquiring
12 wafer container patents in Taiwan and the USA in 
2003. These efforts made Taiwan the third country in the 
world capable of supplying semiconductor wafer 
containers.  
 
With a foundation in the traditional mechanical 
process manufacturing industry, E-SUN fully adopted the 
technologies and experiences of external resources to 
strengthen their production process for precision 
instruments. As a result, E-SUN moved further into the 
semiconductor precision industry with wafer container 
R&D and innovation. Through industry-academy 
cooperation and improvements in innovative R&D, E-
SUN further advanced product efficiency using mass 
production technology to shorten the R&D time. The 
company’s business scope began with OEM, and then 
gradually transformed to ODM to obtain profits from the 
product-designing phase. In recent years, E-SUN has 
invested 6% of its annual operating revenue in R&D. The
business model it shares with the Mechanical and Systems 
Research Laboratories and semiconductor wafer plants 
conforms to OBM in that intellectual property rights 
management proceeds through the intermediary market 
(see Fig. 1).

competitive advantage. Chesbrough (2007) believed 
that the OBM’s value comes from a structure of 
collaboration, interflow, and development [4]. Corporate 
prospects and guiding policies that foster continuing 
innovation promote customer value and establish a good 
network relationship and intercommunication amongst the 
corporate community. Therefore, innovation is only a 
primary element. Using technological innovations, 
procedures, and strategies to satisfy partnership needs in 
the supply chain, and not just pursuing the most beneficial 
case for the corporation, but also establishing the mutually 
beneficial sharing as outlined in the OBM and creating 
industrial competitive advantages.
