Abstract 
This paper studies the effect of Exponential breakdown time and failure-in-rework on optimal production 
run time. In most real-life manufacturing processes, generation of defective items and random breakdown 
of equipment are inevitable. All defective items produced are assumed to be reworkable when regular 
production ends. A portion of reworked items fails during the reworking and becomes scrap. When 
machine breaks down, a no-resumption (NR) policy is adopted. Under this policy, the production run is 
aborted and will be restarted only when all on-hand inventories are depleted. Mathematical modeling, 
derivations of production-inventory cost functions, and proofs of theorems and proposition are presented, 
with the objective for determining optimal run time that minimizes the expected costs per unit time. A 
simple illustrating example is provided. 
 
Keywords: Optimal run time, Poisson breakdown rate, random defects, production, failure in rework 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) model is often utilized in manufacturing firms for 
determining the optimal production lot-size that minimizes overall production-inventory costs 
[1-3]. The EMQ model is an extension to the well-known economic order quantity (EOQ) 
model [4] that uses mathematical modeling to assist corporations in minimizing total inventory 
costs. Regardless of the simplicity of EMQ and EOQ models, they are still applied industry- 
wide today [2-3,5]. Classic EMQ model implicitly assumes that items produced are of perfect 
  4
During the manufacturing process, all items are screened and the inspection cost per item is 
included in the unit production cost C. The defective rate x is assumed to be a random variable 
with a known probability density function. All imperfect quality items produced are reworked at 
a rate of P1, in each production run when regular process ends or when the machine is repaired 
and restored (if a breakdown occurs). A θ1 portion of reworked items fails during the reworking 
and become scrap. The production rate P is much larger than demand rate λ. Hence, the 
production rate of defective items d can be expressed as d=Px. Let d1 denote the production rate 
of scrap items during the rework process, then d1 can be expressed as: d1=P1θ1. Cost parameters 
considered in the proposed model include setup cost K, holding cost h, repairing cost CR and 
holding cost h1 for each reworked item, disposal cost per scrap item CS, and cost for repairing 
and restoring machine M. Additional notations are listed below. 
t = production time before a random breakdown occurs, 
t1 = the optimal run time (i.e. production uptime) to be determined for the proposed EMQ 
model, 
t2 = time required for reworking of defective items when breakdown does not occur, 
t2’ = time needed for reworking of defective items in the case of breakdown takes place, 
t3 = time required for depleting all available perfect quality items when breakdown does 
not occur, 
t3’ = time needed for consuming all available perfect quality items in the case of machine 
breakdown takes place, 
tr = time required for repairing and restoring the machine, 
H1 = maximum level of on-hand inventory in units, when regular production process stops, 
H = the maximum level of on-hand inventory in units, when rework process ends,  
H2 = the level of on-hand inventory when machine breakdown occurs,  
H3 = the maximum level of on-hand inventory when machine is repaired and the reworking 
of defective items are completed,  
H4 = the level of on-hand inventory when machine is repaired,  
β = number of breakdowns per year, a random variable with known probability density 
function, 
T = cycle length when machine breakdown does not occur, 
T’ = cycle length in the case of machine breakdown takes place, 
T = cycle length whether a machine breakdown or not, 
Q = production lot size for each cycle, 
Q’ = completed production quantity of the interrupted lot before it is aborted due to a 
breakdown occurs, 
TC1(t) = the total inventory costs per cycle in the case of machine breakdown takes place, 
TC2(t1) = the total inventory costs per cycle when machine breakdown does not occur, 
TCU(t1) = the total inventory costs per unit time whether a breakdown takes place or not. 
 
The primary assumption for EMQ model with defective rate and shortages not permitting is 
that the production rate of perfect quality items must always be greater than or equal to the sum 
of the demand rate and the production rate of defective items. Therefore, we must have the 
following: (P-d-λ)>=0 or (1-x-λ/P)>=0. Let t denotes production time before a breakdown 
  6
needed for reworking of defective items t2’ and the time needed for depleting all on-hand perfect 
quality items t3’ can also be calculated as shown in Eqs. (7-8).

Since the rework process itself is assumed to be imperfect, a portion θ1 of the reworked 
items fails and becomes scrap items. The production rate d1 in producing scrap items during the 
rework process can be written as: 
1 1 1 1  ,  where      0 1d P θ θ= ⋅ ≤ <        (9) 
Total scrap items produced when the rework process ends, can be computed in Eq. (10): 
1 2 1 1' 'd t x Q x t Pθ θ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅ = ⋅ ⋅ ⋅          (10) 
Since during the rework process, there are [θ1 xQ’] scrap items produced, thus the cycle

In this study, the defective rate is considered to be a random variable with a known 
probability density function. Thus, to take the randomness of defective items into account, one 
can use the expected values of x in the inventory cost analysis. Substituting all related 
parameters from Eqs. (1) to (11) in TC1(t), one obtains the expected total production-inventory 
cost per cycle in the case of machine breakdown takes place, E[TC1(t)] as follows.

2.2 EMQ Model without Breakdowns 
 
In this case, t >= t1, the analysis and result of this case will be the same as that were given by 
Chiu and Gong [26], with the difference on decision variable used. That is t1 is utilized in this 
paper as decision variable, while production lot size Q was used by the prior work [26]; and one 
can obtain the following accordingly:

The expected value of cycle length E[T] can be obtained as shown in Eq. (27). Substituting 
T’ and T from Eqs. (11) and (23), one obtains the expected cycle length as displayed in Eq. (28).

This study assumes that the random number of breakdowns per unit time follows the 
Poisson distribution, with mean equals to β per unit time. Thus, the random production time to 
breakdown should obey the Exponential distribution, with the density function, f(t)=βe-βt; and 
the cumulative density function, F(t)=1-e-βt. To solve the integration of mean-time-to- 
breakdown in the expected cost function E[TCU(t1)] in Eq. (29), one obtains the following:

Once theorem 2 has been proved, although the optimal run time t1* cannot be expressed in a 
closed form, it is obtainable through the use of the bisection method based on the intermediate 
value theorem [20, 27], since the bounds for optimal run time [t1L*, t1U*] are available. 
 
 
4. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE 
 
Suppose that demand of a manufactured product is 4,000 units per year and the production rate 
of this item is 10,000 units per year. During the production uptime, the machine is subject to a 
Poisson distributed breakdown rate of β=0.5 per year. When a breakdown occurs, NR policy is 
used. The percentage of defective items produced x, follows a Uniform distribution over the 
interval [0, 0.2]. All imperfect quality items produced are reworkable, at a rate P1=600 units per 
year. The rework process starts when regular production process stops or when the machine is 
repaired and restored (if a breakdown occurs). During rework process a portion θ1 =0.1 of the 
reworked items fails and becomes scrap. Other related parameters are summarized as follows. 
CR = $0.5 repaired cost for each item reworked, 
CS = $0.3 disposal cost for each scrap item, 
g = 0.018 years, time needed to repair and restore the machine, 
K = $450 for each production run, 
C = $2 per item, 
M = $500 repair cost for each breakdown, 
h = $0.6 per item per unit time, 
h1 = $0.8 per item reworked per unit time. 
  12
bounds [t1L*, t1U*]. Hence, one can use the bisection method based on the intermediate value 
theorem [20,27] to pinpoint its value accurately. A numerical example is provided in Section 4 
to demonstrate its practical usages. For future research, studying the effect of abort/resume (AR) 
policy on the same model will be one possible interesting topic.
