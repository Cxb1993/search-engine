本計畫之雜訊濾除器我們將以攝影鏡頭、FPGA與 TFT_LCD建構出之視訊系統
設計平台完成雜訊消除的IP 設計雛型，我們擬利用此平台上攝影鏡頭取得之
影像，透過 FPGA之雜訊消除 IP電路用來作雜訊消除與測試此功能。並將測試
結果顯示於平台上的TFT_LCD，透過計畫的實施與研究中這個平台的建立除了
可以訓練參與計畫人員視訊系統的相關設計能力外，並能加快產品開發的速度
以提升產品的附加價值。
這個計畫應可大幅提升可攜式產品與機器人系統監控系統的視訊品質。在這多
媒體通訊之世代，實有其執行之必要性與急迫性。
Abstract
Recently, mobile communication and robot industry has become a
considerably hot topic after iPhone, a device that combines iPod with
mobile phone functionality, and intelligence robots were presented.
Both of which had a significant impact on the related markets. During
the stages of planning, verifying, and designing these products, the
embedded system platform plays an important role. Also, the voice
communication is a major part of these products and how to achieve its
high quality becomes a very important issue.
The company which participated in this project has taken a long time
focusing on designs of industry computers and network monitors. It is
very important to attain a noiseless image in these products, especially
at night. Unfortunately, the image has always been corrupted by the
noise. As a result, reducing the noise becomes a crucial issue.
In this project, we applied the published prototype. A Cost-Effective
Noise-Reduction Filtering Structure Based on Unsymmetrical Working
Windows, which uses a fast, efficient algorithm and the associated
VLSI architecture to perform the impulse-noise reduction of image
pixels. The algorithm proposed here is developed with the principle that
the horizontal and vertical, nearly neighboring pixels, are more
significantly correlated to a pixel than other farther distant ones.
The neighboring pixels having the greatest similarity and correlation
with a central pixel are adopted to develop an unsymmetrical working
