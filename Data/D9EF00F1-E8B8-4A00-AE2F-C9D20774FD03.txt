simultaneously detect and classify faults in a 
single-step using fault-specific control charts which 
are designed to discriminate between specific fault 
classes and the normal process operation. Yue et al. 
[5] applied multi-way PCA method to optical 
emission spectra for plasma etchers.  
Despite the effectiveness of the PCA/PLS 
method in dealing with the problems of high 
dimension and collinearities, each PC or latent 
variable is a linear combination of all variables, it is 
often difficult to interpret it. Selecting the variables 
with high loadings on the PCs as key variables is 
error prone as highlighted by Cadima and Jolliffe 
[13]. Variable selection techniques as an alternate 
approach to dimensionality reduction which seeks 
to identify a subset of measurement space that 
contains as much information as possible was 
proposed by McCabe [10]. The most informative 
variables are termed as principle variables. The 
variable selection techniques are extended to 
Longitudinal data and multi-stage processes 
recently [11, 12]. 
Most of the methods mentioned above require 
a large amount of training data to build a reliable 
statistical model to capture the key characteristics 
of the process. However, in the development phase 
of a product, one has to find out the causes of 
un-qualified wafers with limited amount of 
operating data.   Furthermore, although these real 
time sensors provide valuable information about the 
tool status but their relations to final wafer 
characteristics are unknown.  Engineers are eager 
to know which variable in which step in a 
multistage-, multistep-, and multi-variable 
production line is likely the key for inferior product 
quality.  A quick diagnosis of possible cause of 
unqualified product is more desirable. 
Recently, combinatory and high throughput 
experiments have received widespread attention in 
biology.  Synopsis of large amount of experiment 
data and subsequent information mining from such 
data has become a special branch of study known as 
bioinformatics [7].  The key experimental 
technique that is responsible for the advancement of 
bioinformatics is the microarray which enables 
expressions of tens of thousands of genes be 
measured and represented on a small array of 
colored image dots [8].  In this paper, we 
demonstrate that quick diagnosis of the key 
variable/step that causes the fault in final quality 
can be achieved by simple statistical analysis of 
measured values of different sensors and graphical 
synopsis of results of such analysis.   Furthermore, 
specifications for the key variables, which are 
usually far from optimal in original settings, can be 
designated to improve the product yield.   
 
2. VISUALIZATION OF SIMPLE FAULT DETECTION 
Consider a high-density plasma chemical 
vapor deposition (HDP-CVD) process, as shown in 
Fig. 1.   There are 33 process variables for this 
manufacturing process and 9 steps with 193 
measurement times. The quality data of 25 wafers 
are collected, among which 21 wafers are qualified 
and 4 wafers are defective. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the HDP-CVD 
reactor. 
 
More generally, assume that quality data of n 
wafers are collected from a tool, n1 wafers are 
qualified, and n2 wafers are un-qualified, hence 
n1+n2=n. Let Xijk be value of jth (j=1…J) variable at 
the kth time points (k=1…K) of the ith wafer.  Now, 
the question becomes what is the probability that 
the value of Xijk measured for the qualified wafers is 
different from unqualified wafers.  We can 
calculate the p-value of testing the mean of two 
groups at each batch time under the following 
hypothesis

where H0 is the null hypothesis and Ha is the

means of qualified and un-qualified wafers of the jth 
variable at kth time point, superscript 1 and 2 stand 
for qualified and unqualified wafers, respectively. A 
two-side test is implemented here since there is no 
prior knowledge of whether that 1jkµ  should be

variables (solid line, qualified; dashed line,

The key variables found by statistical analysis 
are dome temperatures and wafer temperature. 
Fluctuation in dome temperature may generate 
particles that deposit on the wafer and may result in 
non-uniformity and lack of repeatability of a 
deposited film of material. In addition, variation in 
temperature over regions of the dome may result in 
excessive mechanical stress that can ultimately 
result in dome fracture. The result of the above 
statistical analysis is tested and confirmed by 
operating engineers. 
 
3. VARIATION REDUCTION FOR MULTI-STAGE CVD 
PROCESS 
Consider a chemical vapor deposition CVD 
process in which every wafer must be processed in 
three chambers A, B, and C successively.  Denote 
the process variables of chamber A, B and C as XA, 
XB and XC, respectively. The final quality variable is 
denoted as Y which can be either film thickness 
measurements or wafer electrical measurements.  
There are 13, 5, 12 steps and 79, 19, and 79 process 
variables for chamber A, B and C respectively.  
The data set includes measurements of 526 wafers 
from 22 batches.  A feature variable, e.g. average, 
max, min, range, is provided for each variable in 
each step.  In this analysis, we want to know 
which of these feature variables will have 
significant effect on final quality and how the 
specifications of these process variables can be 
tightened or changed to improve final product 
quality. 
To pick out the most influential variables, the 
first step is to reduce the dimension of the original 
data set.  Process variables are usually highly 
correlated because of physical and chemical 
principles governing the process operation. The 
correlation is assumed to be linear in the following 
analysis. Cluster analysis is a useful technique used 
for combining variables into groups or clusters such 
that each group or cluster is homogeneous with 
respect to certain characteristics; while each group 
should be different from other groups with respect 
to the same characteristics. The definition of 
similarity or homogeneity varies from analysis to 
analysis, and depends on the objectives of the study. 
In this study, it is desired to combine variables that 
are highly correlated into one group. Therefore, the 
similarity measure is defined as

 (Note: The key variables could be single process

It is interesting to note that according to the 
engineers’ experience, the manufacturing on 
chamber B is crucial for the final quality; however, 
the key variable 1 found by the statistical analysis is 
actual temperature measurement of the last step of 
chamber A. After a careful examination, it was 
found that the waiting time before a wafer was sent 
to chamber B is different. This made the 
temperature of wafers different when they were 
fabricated on chamber B. After the variation source 
was found, the final product quality was improved 
greatly. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
In the two given examples, we have presented 
a method of finding the key variables from a large 
set of variables recorded in a limited number of 
runs through a multi-stage multi-step manufacturing 
process.  It should be pointed out that although the 
statistical methods employed, e.g. Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test in the first example, clustering, 
regression and bootstrap estimates in the second are 
not new, however, the summary of analysis results, 
presented in a colored map of p-values which is 
very similar to a DNA microarray, allowed 
engineers to visualize them most intuitively.  In an 
error of data explosion, it is important to develop 
industrial informatics tools that mine out important 
information from large amount of data and present 
them in succinct manners.
