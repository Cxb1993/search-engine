Abstract 
This project proposes a robust 
command-based iterative learning control 
which could be compatible to the current 
control architecture. According to the 
problems encountered in research and 
application, the first objective of this project 
is to develop a robust H∞ control algorithm 
which can be applied under different payload 
and noise input. Most of research on iterative 
learning control is only focused on 
convergence analysis without considering the 
convergence rate. Therefore, the project 
proposes an optimization loop design concept 
which can adjust the learning gain such that 
the best convergence rate can be achieved. 
The transient behavior for the system at the 
start, corner and end points would be 
evaluated and a zero-phase filter will be 
applied and analyzed to improve the system 
performances. The second task is to integrate 
the learning control, curve fitting, and 
interpolation techniques such that the 
machinery time can be reduced and the 
precision can be enhanced. The concept is to 
apply curve fitting technique on the learned 
command such that a NURBS curve can be 
formulated. The cutting quality can be 
improved and the machining time can be 
reduced significantly. Finally, the developed 
technology will be applied and validated by 
using the three axes milling machine and the 
developed CNC controller in our lab.  
 
Keywords: robust repetitive learning control, 
NURBS interpolation, dynamic response.  
 
I. Introduction 
Iterative learning control (ILC) is a 
technique to control the systems operating 
same tasks repetitively. The idea of the ILC is 
to use error information from previous tasks 
to improve performance for subsequent tasks 
by updating the control inputs from trial to 
trial. The ILC can be applied to robot 
manipulators [1], machine tools [2], chemical 
batch process [3], and so on. The ILC was 
first proposed in the mid-1980 by Arimoto, et 
al. [4]. Since then, many schemes of the ILC 
including the 2D theory method [5], inverse 
system [6], stochastic method [7], and 
feedback learning operators [8, 9] have been 
proposed by many researchers in the past two 
decades. Technical review on the 
methodologies and applications of the ILC is 
referred to [10]. 
Among all research issues related to the 
ILC, system robustness and monotonic 
convergence of tracking error are major 
concerns in the implementation of ILC to 
either linear or nonlinear systems [11]. To 
overcome the system uncertainty problem, the 
adaptive iterative learning control was 
 4
process. Then an optimization process is 
proposed to iterate the optimal learning gain 
such that not only the convergence condition 
of the learning process can be satisfied but 
also the system performance measured by the 
H∞ norm is minimized.   
3.1 Development of error dynamics 
equation with consideration of noise effects 
and plant uncertainties 
Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of 
command-based ILC where rk and rk+1 are 
the input commands at the kth and the (k+1)th 
iteration, respectively. yd is the desired 
trajectory, )z(nk , )z(yk  and )z(ek  denote 
the measurement noise, the output signal and 
the tracking error with measurement noise. 
The tracking error ke  processed by a 
learning control L(z) and learning gain Φ is 
added to the reference command rk to obtain 
the new updated command rk+1. The 
complete learning process shown in Fig. 2 can 
be represented by the following equations.  
)z(e)z(ΦL)z(r)z(r kk1k             (5) 
)z(y)z(y)z(e kdk                  (6) 
)z(n)z(G)z(r)z(G)z(y knkrk          (7) 
)z(n)z(e)z(e kkk                  (8) 
where yk and ek denote system output 
signal and tracking error, respectively. The 
error dynamic equation can be derived from 
Eqs. (5)-(8) and given as the following:  
      
)nn(GnΦLGe)ΦLG-(1       
nG)ne(ΦLG)nGe(

   (9) 
It is shown that the noise accumulation on 
the tracking error is processed through rLG  
and nG . However, the third term of Eq. (9) 
can not be affected by the learning control and 
thus it is not included in the design process. 
The error dynamic equation can be further 
simplified as: 
krkr1k nΦLGe)ΦLG-(1e            (10) 
Equation (10) indicates that the tracking 
performance is strongly influenced by the 
transfer function rLG . 
Note that Gr in Eq. (10) represents the 
general closed loop transfer function of the 
x-axis or y axis. Using the multiplicative 
uncertainty representation, the Gr can be 
further represented by the nominal plant 
Gr0(z) and the weighting function W(z) and 
given as:  
Gr(z)=Gr0(z)(1+W(z)△(z))               (11)          
Here △ (z) is the small perturbation 
normalized to be 1 . By substituting Eq. 
(11) into Eq. (10), the errors dynamics 
becomes:

3.2 Robust ILC using H∞ control 
After developing the error dynamics, the 
H∞ control can be designed by first 
transforming the error dynamics into a linear 
fraction transformation (LFT) form [27]. 
Figure 3 shows the block diagram 
corresponding to the error dynamic equation 
(12). The block diagram can be represented 
by the following LFT form given as:

With the developed models by Eqs. (15) 
and (16), the perturbed system model can be 
described by a block diagram shown in Fig. 4 
 6
experiments are performed using a three-axis 
machine tool system shown in Fig. 6. Here the 
x, y, and z axes of the machine tool are driven 
by Panasonic MHMD042S1S servo motors 
and MHMD042S1S servo drives. The 
resolution of the linear scale for each axis is 
equal to 1μm. The real-time extension (RTX) 
[29] is used to ensure the control system with 
real-time performance. The output data from 
the linear scale are processed by the 
Advantech 1784 encoder card. The plant 
parameters are identified using a frequency 
domain approach. The nominal plant Gr0(s) is 
measured with a linear swept-frequency signal 
at the magnitude of -1 Volt to 1 Volt and the 
frequencies from 0.1 Hz to 1000 Hz, and 
identified by using the Empirical Transfer 
Function Estimate (ETFE) method [30]. The 
bandwidth of the velocity closed-loop transfer 
function are chosen as 502.65 rad/sec, 
respectively. The bandwidth of position 
closed-loop transfer function is chosen as 
251.33 rad/sec and the velocity feedforward 
gain fK  is selected to 0.95. All parameters 
of the closed-loop systems are listed in Table 
I unless stated otherwise.  
4.1 Numerical simulation  
In this section, numerical simulations are 
performed to illustrate the proposed robust 
ILC algorithm. The butterfly curve shown in 
Fig. 7 and the velocity profile shown in Fig. 8 
are used for demonstration. The frequency 
response of the nominal plant Gr0 for x-axis 
and y-axis are shown in Fig. 9. In the servo 
control system, the payload on the moving 
platform might be varied with different 
machining parts. Three payloads given as 0, 
10, and 20 Kg are tested in the moving 
platform. The 10 and 20 Kg payload changes 
can cause the moment of inertial Js in Fig. 1 
to deviate about 8% and 16%, respectively. 
The corresponding weighting function W(s) to 
cover the uncertainty bounds is shown in Fig. 
10 and given as:  
200s
s5.0)s(W                 (28) 
To design the appropriate Φ  and L, the 
conventional H∞ methodology with 
uncertainty bounds Eq. (28) is adopted first. 
Unfortunately, the convergence condition set 
by Eq. (19) could not be satisfied no matter 
what value of the Φ  and its corresponding L 
is designed. The minimum value of the H∞ 
norm is always larger than 1.03 and the 
convergence rate to 10 % error reduction 
requires 19 iteration. The fact demonstrates 
that the conventional H∞ control with 
consideration of large uncertainty and noise 
effect might not be directly applied to design 
the ILC controller. Therefore, the modified 
H∞ control is proposed to achieve 
convergence performance.  
After applying the design process shown 
in Fig. 5, it is found that the learning gain Φ  
should be in the range of 0.3 and 0.53 to 
satisfy the convergence condition. The 
optimal learning gain is determined to be 0.53 
and the corresponding W~Z~T  in Eq. (17) is 
0.99982 for the payload uncertainty equal to 
Eq. (28).  
After obtaining L(z), the case of the 
butterfly curve is used as a working example.  
The comparisons of tracking error between 
the cases of without learning and the learning 
after the 10th iteration are shown in Fig. 11. It 
shows that the RMS and maximum values of 
the tracking error for the x and y-axis after 10 
iterations can be reduced more than 99%, 
respectively. The trends for the RMS and 
maximum values of the tracking errors under 
each iterations are illustrated in Fig. 12. The 
system robustness is validated by testing the 
designed controller on the servo system with 
the payload varies from 0, 10, and 20 kg.  
The results are shown in Fig. 13 and in Table 
2 which shows that the designed controller 
can achieve similar performances even with 
the 20 Kg uncertainty payload.  
4.2 Experimental validation 
In this section, experiments are conducted 
on the machining tool with the payload equal 
to 0, 10 kg and 20 kg, respectively. The 
comparisons of tracking error between the 
cases of without learning and the learning 
after the 10th iteration are shown in Fig. 14 
and in Table 3. From the results, the tracking 
performances of the x-axis and the y-axis are 
much improved under the conditions of 
different loadings. The RMS values of x-axis 
output tracking errors under the conditions of 
that without loading, loading 10kg weight and 
loading 20 kg weight reduce 99.40%, 99.40% 
and 99.41% after 10 iterations. The RMS
