中文摘要 
重組組織型纖溶酶原激活劑（tPA）已証實, 在缺血範圍不超過大腦中動脈（MCA）
分佈的三分之一的前提下, 能有效治療早期急性缺血性中風。阿爾伯塔省急性缺血
性中風早期 CT評分方法已逐漸被許多機構採用。然而實行起來對中風中心的臨床醫
生來說,仍然是一個挑戰。本研究的目的是開發一個自動化的評分系統，以提供客觀
的評估以及決策支持。其高精確度的測試結果證明了它能在急性腦中風處治上提供
臨床決策支持的潛力。

前言 
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a very useful method of treating acute stroke patients if less 
than one third of the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is involved[1,2]. 
Unfortunately, multiple studies have shown significant inter-observer and intra-observer 
variability when it comes to quantifying the amount of ischemic changes[3,4]. In response to this 
issue, the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) was proposed to be a more reliable 
and reproducible grading system for evaluating acute stroke in comparison with the 
aforementioned one-third rule. The superiority of the ASPECTS system to the 1/3 MCA rule in 
terms of clinician agreement has been validated[5,6]. 
Up to this point, all the scoring systems that have been proposed to assess the extent to which 
the MCA territory is involved essentially rely on subjective human perception and judgment. 
Such issues have motivated researchers to attempt more  objective  assessments  by  means  of  
automatic computer-aided algorithms.

文獻探討 
In  the  literature,  only  one  paper  can  be  found  which directly addressed the potential power 
of automated computer analysis on CT images to facilitate acute stroke diagnosis[7]. The major 
limitation of the said paper, however, is that it only addressed regions of lentiform nucleus and 
insula, which are only part of the extensive MCA territory that needs to be examined for the 
detection of hypodense, ischemic parenchyma.   It failed to present a full blown, working 
automated scoring system that has been fully verified in terms of accuracy.

B.  Standard atlas (template) 
Spatial realignment is essential for brain image analysis which involves multiple subjects. 
The common approach in building  a  standard  atlas  for  the  human  brain  is  using 
3-dimensional    spatial    normalization    by    relying    on 
9-parameter affine transformation which comprises three translation parameters, three rotational 
parameters and three scaling parameters[9]. Since ASPECTS scoring is based on two non-
contagious slices, S1 and S2, the whole process of 
3D   spatial   normalization   can   thus   be   simplified   to 
2-dimensional spatial normalization of S1 and S2, where S1 is at the level of the thalamus and 
basal ganglion; whereas S2 is at the level adjacent to the most superior margin of the ganglionic 
structures such that they are not seen. In our study, the standard atlas consisting of two 
templates, TEM1 and TEM2, was created by taking the average of brain images from healthy 
individuals. TEM1 contains seven regions of interest: caudate head (C), lentiform nucleus (L), 
internal capsule (IC), insular ribbon (I), anterior MCA cortex (M1), MCA cortex lateral to 
insular ribbon (M2), and posterior MCA cortex (M3), whereas TEM2 contains three regions of 
interest: anterior MCA territory (M4), lateral MCA territory (M5) and posterior MCA territory 
(M6). M4, M5 and M6 are approximately   2   cm   superior   to   M1,   M2   and   M3, 
respectively. 
. 
 
C.  Image segmentation 
The purpose of image segmentation is to delineate the exact boundaries of the ten ROIs 
automatically. It consists of two steps: (1) global approximate registration, and (2) regional 
precise registration.  Firstly, the standard templates for the ten ROIs are proportionally scaled 
both horizontally and vertically to produce subject-specific templates to achieve approximate 
registration.  Since both the standard templates and their corresponding slice images for the 
subject under investigation are already aligned vertically, no rotation transformation is needed.

結果與討論 
A total of 45 patients with symptoms of acute stroke, based on clinical testing and follow-up 
images, were retrospectively selected from patients who came to Chang Gung Memorial 
Hospital for treatment between Jan 2011 and July 2011. Unenhanced CT was performed, with 
the patient in a head holder, in the transverse plane. Representative sample parameters, with 
minimal variations between scanners and sites shown as ranges, were as follows: 120 to140 kVp, 
170 mA, 2-second scan time, and 5-mm section thickness. In addition, 20 patients who 
complained about headache, but who were subsequently verified to be free from acute stroke, 
were also included in this study as a control group.  All in all, 65 subjects were included in the 
study. 
For the purpose of evaluating the performance of the algorithm developed herein, the total 65 
subjects were divided into a training set of 32 subjects consisting of 10 normal subjects and 22 
patients and a test set of 33 subjects consisting of 10 normal subjects and 23 patients. The 
ASPECTS scoring system examines ten regions of brain CT images to give an overall score 
within the range between 0 and 10.  Instead of comparing overall scores given by the automated 
algorithm against scores given by an expert neurologist, we have decided to compare regional 
scores.  Consequently, we have 33 caudate regional scores produced by the automated algorithm 
and 33 corresponding scores produced by expert neurologists.  Each score is either -1 or 0.  The 
accuracy rate, ARR, for a region, R, is defined as  
𝐴𝑅𝑅 = 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚′𝑠 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑠 𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑡′𝑠 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒33  
The results show that the accuracy rates for all of the ten regions are no less than 73%.  
Further analysis of the test results is still going on.  The final results along with discussions are 
expected to be published in technical Journal in the near future.

會後共計晚餐時，好奇聯發科怎麼會參與生物醫學國際研討會，才知聯發科近年
也積極想跨入生物醫學領域，雙方會談愉快，也交換名片，希望將來有互相合作
的機會。 
第二天，我報告當天，心情相當輕鬆，並沒有特別的緊張，可能是因為前一
天與學者們的輕鬆相處後，已適當地讓不安的情緒獲得緩解，且此次大會更邀請
我擔任 Co-Chairman，這對我是個相當難得經驗，不僅要控制會議的進行，更要
在無人提問時，提出一個問題拋磚引玉，所幸僅管是我的第一次處女秀，我感覺
我自己表現還算可以，並未丟台灣的臉。接著我餘上午 0910-0930的報告相當順
利，也引起與會學者熱烈討論，顯然這個題目算是相當引人注目的議題，只要我
們認真研究，應該未來會有不錯的學術表現。雖然有一位 Oman學者Mohammed 
Ahmed Ali Al以頗重的口音問了一堆問題，讓我小緊張了了一下，不過豎起耳朵
認真聆聽下，終究還是逐一有條理地完成回答，而德國、泰國 Sittichoke Janyong 
and Chanyut Sudtongkong、泰國 Dr. Anchalee Wannaruk、加拿大 Dr. Andre Blondin、
馬來西亞 Julismah Jani, Mai Shihah Abdullah, Noraini Ismail, and Rosmimah Mohd 
Roslin、伊朗Mana Tarjoman and Shaghayegh Zarei以及其他學者的問題都早在自
己的預料中，準備充分下都能順利解決。會後參加 IEEE二位教授的期刊導讀與
poster場次的討論，與眾多學者交流心得，並了解國際學術投稿過程中，主編與
學者所在意的細節，相信對未來學術論文的發表，助益相當大。 
第二天下午三點，儘管還有相當議題非常吸引我，但因明天醫院能需查房，
只好快速收拾行哩，往香港海關衝去，行程相當緊湊，過海關的人又相當多，差
點搭不上飛機，但終於在最後一刻 1830 搭上國泰飛機回到我可愛的故鄉台灣。
回想起來，本次國際研討會的時間，僅有短短的兩天時間，真是太短促，完全只
有學術的吸收，下次還有機會應要多一些時間，遊歷多一點，認識更多國際學者，
體驗當地生活，藉機深入了解當地多面向之總體環境，更藉由此機會增加未來與
當地或國際學術交流的機會。
