INTRODUCTION
The control of flexible bridge structures, such as cable-stayed bridges, is viewed as a unique
and challenging problem with many complexities in modeling, control design, and
implementation. Long-span cables are especially susceptible to vibration with large amplitude
under wind/rain loading or support excitations due to their high flexibility, relatively small mass
and very low inherent damping [1]. In 1993 Warnitchai et al. [2] experimentally and analytically
studied active tendon control of cable-stayed bridges, subjected to a vertical sinusoidal force.
They utilized a simple cable-supported cantilever beam as a model. Up to now, many research
efforts have been focused on the interaction of cables with the deck and attenuation of the cable
movement [3-5]. Other research efforts have been aimed at understanding the overall dynamic
behavior of cable-stayed bridges and developing finite element models [6]. The working group on
bridge control within the ASCE Committee on Structural Control recently posted a
first-generation benchmark structural control problem based on the Cape Girardeau Bridge [Dyke
et al. 2000]. This problem focus on one-dimensional ground acceleration applied in the
longitudinal direction that is uniformly and simultaneously applied at all supports. In the work of
Moon [8, 9], a semi-active system for the benchmark bridge employing MR dampers in
conjunction with a LDG/clipped optimal control (LQG/MR) and a sliding mode semi-active
control system (SMC/MR) was studied. In addition, a hybrid base isolation system employing
semi-active control devices (using MR-dampers), often termed “smart”dampers, has been
suggested to control the damping force of bridge structure [9]. In design of modern feedback
control systems, the question of uncertainties in the models and the excitations, within the context
of robust control, is becoming one of the important issues. For example, an active scheme that
uses active tendons via feedback of the states of the system for vibration control of cable-stayed
bridge under seismic loads has also been proposed by Rodellar [10]. While different approaches
have been adopted for robust control of civil engineering structures, such as Hand related tools
[11], neural networks and fussy logic [12], and sliding mode control [13, 14], the use of these
approaches to control of cable-stayed bridges has been limited so far. In the ASCE phase II
benchmark control problem, a three-dimensional evaluation model has been developed to
represent complex behavior of the multi-support and transverse excitations of the Cape Girardeau
Bridge [15]. The benchmark problem and a sample control design have been made available in
the form of a set of MATLAB equations.
In this research the control of cable-stayed bridge is studied. Based on the detailed design
information of the Gi-Lu cable-stayed bridge in Taichung County, Taiwan, a 3-dimensional
numerical model has been developed to represent the complex behavior of the full-scale bridge.
Dynamic behavior of the cable including sag geometry, pre-stress tension force, and nonlinear
matrix is the linear stiffness matrix, the second term is due to nonlinearity, and N is related to the
axial force due to large deformation:
( ' )
E A
N L L
L
  (2)
in which L’is the actual length along the center line of the beam. However, to deal with the
complex behavior of cables, the computational procedures must be modified. In development of
the initial cable stiffness is important to obtain the actual pre-tensioned values (not designed
values) and to include correct element properties (modulus of elasticity, moment inertia of
cross-sectional area, length of taut cables, and Poisson’s ratio). The procedures for developing the
initial cable stiffness are shown below:
1. Choose how many elements to use in the formulation, then transform equation (1) into a
three dimensional nonlinear beam element. It is assumed that Poisson’s ratio equals zero.
2. Use the initial length to generate the stiffness matrix where N equals the pre-tensioned value,
then divide the self-weight of cables into an appropriate number of equal parts (n).
3. Use Newton-Raphson iteration scheme to solve [K]{D}={Fext} by appropriate conditions of
convergence.
4. Calculate the present length due to large lateral deformation and re-formulate the cable
stiffness matrix where N is still the pre-tensioned value.
5. Repeat Step(5) until the total steps equal to n (in Step(4)).
From these procedures, stiffness matrices of the cables can satisfy effects of sag and measured
natural frequencies.
The vibration frequencies of each stayed-cable in the Gi-Lu bridge were examined from
three different approaches: (1) experiments, (2) ABAQUS, and (3) MATLAB equations. For
example, for the longest cables (No. 33 and No. 34), it described as: (i) Angle of elevation 26o. (ii)
Designed length 126.42 m. (iii) Length density 47.9kg/m. (iv) Young’s modulus 1.83E11 N/m2.
(v) Cross section area 0.0060 m2, and (vi) Gravity 9.81m/sec2. The FEM model developed using
ABAQUS has one thousand beam elements and considers the cable structure to be subjected to
gravity and to have fixed-end boundary conditions. The cable force and moment of inertia were
identified by matching the twenty-one vibration frequencies of the cables to those obtained from
the field experiment. Through an optimally iterative process, the identified cable force is 1.66E6
N, and the identified moment of inertia is 5.0E-6 m4. This information is used to formulate
equations in MATLAB for the stiffness matrix of the cable system. The vibration frequency of
each cable predicted by ABAQUS and MATLAB are verified using field experiments. The
identified cable force is only 91.4% (1.66E6 N/ 1.81E6 N) of the force estimated by string
vibration theory. Comparison between the identified vibration frequencies of the cable R1, R17
and R34 using MATLAB and ABAQUS is shown in Table 1. Cables “1”& “2”indicate the
DOFs for support from piers and side spans and subscript (coup) indicates coupled terms between
supports and others; U is the displacement response vector; Mtotal , Ctotal , Ktotal are the mass,
damping and stiffness matrices respectively of the whole structural system, and Pext is the vector
of external forces.
Model reduction (Static condensation and Quasi-static reduction)
Because the bridge model has a large number of degrees of freedom, then static condensation is
applied to reduce the redundant DOFs and retain the main DOFs. The main DOFs is taken here to
include the nodes of the main girder, pylon, piers, side span, and cables including the nodes
connecting the cables to the deck and pylon. It is assumed that the total displacement can be
divided into two parts: active DOFs (main nodes) and dependent DOFs (redundant nodes).
Therefore, the equation for the static condensation can be formed as

where the subscript“a”denotes the active DOFs and“d”denotes dependent DOFs. Then the total

and the active DOFs of Ua represent two components: Ua,cdp, the DOFs from cables, deck and
pylon, and Ua,sp, the DOFs from piers and side spans (supports). The total displacement Ua,cdp can
also be separated into the displacement Ua,cdps due to static application of the ground motion, and
the dynamic displacement Ua,cdpd relative to the quasi-static displacement. The relationship

CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN
A test bed for development of effective control strategies for cable-stayed bridge has been
developed with emphasis on nonlinear behavior of the stayed-cable. A completed control circuit
of the system includes the excitation, evaluated model, devices, sensors, and control algorithms.
A SIMULINK block diagram for this control system study is shown in Figure 3. It is patterned
for SIMULINK block diagram provided by Dyke et al.[6] and Caicedo et al. [15]. A detailed
description of the SIMULINK block diagram for this analysis is described as follows [16].
Excitation
Earthquake record from the Chi-Chi earthquake was selected as the excitation to this cable-stayed
bridge. Each earthquake record contains 3-D acceleration data and 3-D velocity data (from
integration of acceleration data). To consider the spatial variation of earthquake excitation,
uniform input with a phase delay was specified (4 km/s apparent wave velocity was assumed).
Evaluation Model
The evaluation model contains two input ports and six output ports. The excitation input port
includes 9 acceleration values and 9 velocity values to describe the multi-support problem in 3-D
and the time-delayed excitation. The input port of the control force is generated from the design
of control devices. The evaluated output serves to determine the control efficiency of various
control criteria. It contains 19 sensors locating as follows:
a. Acceleration and displacement sensors at the northern end and southern end of the deck, at
the middle node of the deck, and at the top of the pylon (in both longitudinal (x) and
transverse (z) directions, a total of 16 sensors.
b. Displacement sensors located at the top of all three piers in the longitudinal direction, a total
of 3 sensors.
The output port of cable sensors gives the responses of the cables including acceleration and
displacement measurements of the deck or the pylon (or piers). The device sensors provide the
responses of control systems between connections. The output port of tension estimates the
variation of cable tensile force using the deformation of cables. The cable deformations are
selected to consider the dimensionless responses at the middle node of each cable.
Sensor Processor
The sensor processor converts the responses of the bridge to the voltage signal. The converter for
each sensor has a range of ± 10 V. Each of the measured responses contains a noise level with an
rms value of 0.01V. Measurement noises are modeled with Gaussian rectangular pulses that have
a pulse width equal to the integration step.
are employed between the deck and each cable (see Figure 4b). Four types of damper
capacity are selected for these viscous dampers due to considering the characteristics of
different cables. The damping coefficient of all types of dampers is: 120,000 (N-s/m) for
cable 1 through 10, 42,857 (N-s/m) for cable 11 and 12, 30,000 (N-s/m) for cable 13 and
14, and 7,500 (N-s/m) for cable 15 through 17, respectively.
Case B: Two sets of huge visco-elastic dampers are placed at locations similar to the locations of
actuators in Case A. Each set of dampers contains six passive control devices with
stiffness (50000 kN/m per damper) and damping coefficient (2500 kN-s/m per damper).
To control cable vibration, 68 MR dampers are employed in the bridge. There are three
types of MR dampers including: (1) 120 mm for stroke, 350 mm/s for maximum velocity,
and 30 kN for force capacity, (2) 120mm for stroke, 1,050 mm/s for maximum velocity,
and 30kN for force capacity, and (3) 240mm for stroke, 3,500 mm/s for maximum
velocity, and 30 kN for force capacity. The location of all types of MR dampers is played
between the deck and the cable. Type I damper is selected for cable 4~9, type II damper
is selected for cable 1~3 & 10~12, and type III dampers is selected for cable 13~17.
Each type of MR dampers has the voltage range from 0 V to 1.2 V. In this case, three
levels of voltage of MR dampers are used ranging from 0 V (passive-off), 0.6 V, and 1.2
V (passive-on).
Case C: Two isolators are placed between the deck and the top of piers including pier-1 and
pier-3. The elastic stiffness of the isolator is assumed as 2E6 (kN/m) and the post-yield
stiffness is assumed as 3E5 (kN/m). Additionally, sixty-eight MR dampers are also
employed similarly to Case B.
Case D: Huge viscous-elastic dampers are utilized similarly to Case B. At the same time, 68 MR
dampers are employed in this case. Forty of these MR dampers are placed between the
deck and cables through cable 1 to cable 10 at each side. Remaining MR dampers are
placed at the middle of the cable connecting two neighboring cables through cable 10 to
cable 17 at each side (as shown in Figure 4c). In this case, three types of MR dampers
similar to Case B are selected to control cable vibration. Type I of MR dampers is used
to position between cable 4 to cable 9 and the deck. Type II of MR dampers is used to
position between cable 1~3 and the deck, between cable 10 and the deck, and between
cable 10~12. Type III of MR dampers are positioned between cable 13~17. Three levels
of voltage of MR dampers are chosen to evaluate control performance similarly to Case
B.
Case E: two isolators are placed at both ends of the bridge below the deck as Case B. The
property of isolators is also same as Case B. Sixty-eight MR dampers are employed as
Case D including the locations, types, and voltage commands.
polynomial functions, but yield velocity uses a second-order polynomial function with respect to
voltage. It is important to mention that the bilinear model used in this study consists of three
stroke divisions (35mm, 35mm~70mm, and above 70mm) so that there are three sets of
parameters in this model.
By adopting the combined bi-viscous and bilinear model the command voltage is sent to the
modified bi-viscous model with the states as input and then generates the corresponding force. A
constraint function of voltage with a second-order polynomial function is used to obtain the lower
bound of the force. If the corresponding force is greater than the lower bound, the output force is
still the force generated by the modified bi-viscous model. On the contrary, the output force is
changed to obtain the bilinear model. The model follows the rules as described above is shown in
Figure 8. Therefore, this model combines the characteristics of two models that can be effective
to describe the behavior of MR dampers and improve convergence.
CONTROL EVALUATION: CASE STUDY
Earthquake ground motion data from the Chi-Chi earthquake from recorded station TCU071
is selected as the excitation. In this study a uniform input motion with three components (two
horizontal and one vertical component) is used. Peak ground accelerations of three components
are 703 gal for E-W direction, 489 gal for N-S direction, and 416 gal for Vertical direction,
respectively. Figure 9 shows the acceleration response spectrum of the recorded data.
As discussed earlier there are five cases of hybrid control systems in this study, and the
capacity of MR dampers is adjusted by using three types of voltages. The model of MR dampers
in simulation is also followed from the previous description but the maximum resisting force is
amplified to 30 kN. Figure 10a shows the comparison on longitudinal displacement responses at
the end of the deck for case B and case D. It is observed that using isolator will have a better
control effectiveness than using visco-elastic damper on the control of deck vibration. Through
numerical study they show that all of the four hybrid control systems can reduce the seismic
response of the bridge deck at both ends effectively. As for the installation of MR dampers on the
cables, the vibration reduction of the deck response is not so obvious with such an installation.
Only minor contribution on the reduction of deck response is observed by using such a hybrid
control system. The other goal for this control issue is to compare the control effectiveness of the
cable response. Figure 10b shows the comparison on the longitudinal displacement responses of
the longest cable by using control case B and case D. To improve the stability of cable vibration
the installation of MR dampers between two neighboring cables is recommended.
Based on the forty-five evaluation criteria the performance indices are evaluated among the
controlled and uncontrolled cases. Figure 11 shows the evaluation criteria with respect to
of a set of MATLAB equations. This code can provide another type of benchmark structural
control problem for cable-stayed bridges. The numerical results from use of a hybrid control
system look promising; however, a number of practical aspects not considered here need to be
tackled in further studies in order to gain a deeper evaluation of the potential effectiveness for
mitigation of vibration.

Topic 2:
Application of Centralized and Decentralized Control to
Building Structure: Analytical Study
ABSTRACT
This paper presents both the centralized and decentralized control strategies by using active or
semi-active devices (MR damper) for building structural control under seismic excitations. Based
on the H2 control theory, acceleration measurement is used as feedback signal in the centralized
and decentralized control algorithms. In the centralized control the overall information of the
measurement is used to generate the control force while in the decentralized control only
measurement from local sub-systems is used to calculate the control force with respect to the
locations of control devices and measurements. Five different decentralized control algorithms
are studied: Centralized control, Fully centralized control, Half centralized control, Partially
decentralized control (coupled & uncoupled). The ASCE 20-story benchmark building is selected
as an example to examine the control effectiveness among different control strategies.
Keywords: Centralized control, De-centralized control, H2 control algorithm, MR-damper,
Based on the ability to dissipate the hysteretic energy and to generate different levels of
force commands, the semi-active control devices, such as MR dampers, have been developed and
applied to control of structure in recent years [Dyke et al., 1996; Spencer et al., 1999; Yang et al.,
2002; Occhiuzzi et al., 2003]. A number of control algorithm to mitigate the seismic and modeled
a magnetorheological damper for simulation was also studied [Dyke et al., 1996]. This study
proves the effectiveness of MR dampers in the application of structural control. The highly
voltage-dependent nonlinear hysteretic behavior makes MR dampers very flexible to resist
different levels of external force. Several analytical and experimental studies of seismic
protection for structures using MR dampers have been published [Lin et al., 2002, 2004; Renzi et
al., 2004]. Ohtori et al. [2004] developed a benchmark control problem, focusing primarily on the
nonlinear behavior of a 20-story high-rise building, and the benchmark problem had been
recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). This benchmark structure is
selected in this study to examine the centralized and decentralized control methods with MR
dampers. Similar simulation study using MR-damper for vibration control assessment of ASCE
benchmark model of cable-stayed bridge is also discussed [Loh and Chang, 2006]. These results
show that MR dampers have been proved as an effective control device for structural control.
The objective of this research is to study both the centralized and decentralized control
strategies by using semi-active devices (MR damper) for building structural control under seismic
excitations. Based on the H2 control theory, acceleration measurement is used as feedback signal
in the centralized and decentralized control algorithms. In the centralized control the overall
information of the measurement is used to generate the control force while in the decentralized
control only measurement from local sub-systems is used to calculate the control force with
respect to the locations of control devices and measurements. Five different decentralized control
algorithms are studied: Centralized control, Fully centralized control, Half centralized control,
Partially decentralized control (coupled & uncoupled). The ASCE 20-story benchmark building
for nonlinear control research based on MATLAB program is selected as an example to examine
the control effectiveness among different control strategies.
FORMULATION THE CONTROL PROBLEM
The equation of motion for a building control system can be expressed as
gMx Cx Kx M x bu       (1)
where, x is the active DOF; and M, C, and K are mass, damping, and stiffness matrices of the
structural system, respectively. gx is the input ground acceleration as one of external forces, u is
each element of the state vector and other control forces. From the mathematical point of view, in
fully centralized control, the reddA and reddB matrices can not be separated into individual
columns or rows. Since the full-state measurement is impossible and can not be implemented for
realistic structural control, therefore, the Kalman estimator, which transforms the measured
vector into the full-state vector, will be used to estimate the full-state responses of the structural
system and then to calculate the control gain. Based on the H2 control algorithms, the objective
function from H2 control theory is defined as

where Q is a weighting matrix related to the reduced-order main system and R is another
weighting matrix related to the control force. Through minimizing the J function, the Ricatti
equation is shown as

where G is the control gain. Eq. (7) shows that the control force is associated with the full-state
vector. Considering the limited sensors in the structure, the Kalman estimator need to be selected
to transform the limited measurements into the full-state measurement estimation, as shown
below:

Here, L is the solution of the Ricatti equation from the Kalman formulation [Dyke et al. 1996].

(7a)
where csAˆ is the modified system matrix in relating to control and msL is the Kalman estimator
in relating to measurement. Finally, Eq. (7) provides the estimated full-state response ( reddz
 ) to
estimate the control forces in the real response. Because the control force was generated using the
full-state response vector, it is called the fully centralized control.
emphasizes on the control of local system around the location of control device by using the
response measurements from sensors around the local sub-system so as to generate the control
force instantly and efficiently. From this point of view, a complete structural system can be
assumed as composition of many sub-systems and each sub-system contains its own sensor
measurement and control devices in that sub-system. It means that every controller in the
sub-system is independent and no relation to each other directly. The main advantage for the
decentralized control of structure is to drive each controller independently so that the malfunction
of individual controller will not cause the failure of whole control system. Similarly to the
procedure of the half centralized control, the discrete state-space equation can be rewritten as

where“j”indicates the measured output of each sub-system which is on the same location as the
control device located and“i”is the i-th control device.“j”may be one value or a vector which
depends on the number of measurement from the corresponding sub-system. From Eq. (14), the
control gain can be obtained similar to Eq. (11) using the same objective functions. But the
Kalman estimator needs to be modified as:

(15)
It means that based on the measurement from individual sub-system the estimation of full-state is
required. Substitute the control force with control gain and the state vector, Eq. (15) can be
rewritten as

where “i”indicates the i-th estimator which is with the same length of the full-state vector. And
the control force can be obtained from

Partially Decentralized Control of Structural System
Uncoupled Method
Besides the fully decentralized control, the partially decentralized control provides a more
practical approach for real implementation. The partially decentralized control divides the global
systems into several sub-systems, and each sub-system may cover more DOFs than the fully
decentralized control method and each sub-system has its own control devices. For example, a
building with 20 stories can be separated into four groups of sub-systems, in which every

where m indicates the m-th estimator and has the upper bound with the same number of the whole
sub-systems. But the length for the reduced-order state vector in the m-th estimator is also similar
to the full-state vector. The control force for each sub-system is expressed as:

j=1,4 for four sets of sub-systems. Combine all the four subsystems the control force will be:

Coupled Method
The coupled method of the partially decentralized control is to modify the un-overlapped
sub-system of the uncoupled method of the partially decentralized control into an overlapped case.
The reduced-order state-space equation can be expressed in the same form as Eq. (17). For the
case of the building with 20 stories, the index i contains four sets of control position in each
sub-system (same as the uncoupled method of the partially decentralized control) and the index j
contains four sets of subsystems with the absolute acceleration responses of 1~7, 4~12, 9~17, and
14~20 stories. And the way to generate the control gain is also similar to Eqs. 18, 19, and 20, in
which jˆ must be 1~7, 4~12, 9~17, and 14~20 in the case of the 20-story building. The step to
obtain the Kalman estimator is the same as the uncoupled method in Eqs. 20 and 21. The control
gain for each sub-system can then be expressed as:

Fully Coupled Method
The fully coupled method of the partially decentralized control is to improve the generation of the
control gain by eliminating the minor elements from the system equation. First, the reduced-order
state-space equation must be reformulated from the fundamental equation of motion and
expressed as

CONTROL SYSTEM
The goal of this paper is to propose various control methods, including two centralized control
methods and four decentralized control methods to control the 20-story ASCE benchmark
building using MR-dampers. This study was originally designed by Brandow & Johnston
Associates (1996) for the SAC Phase II Steel Project.
Structure The twenty-story structure is 30.48 m by 36.58 m in plan, and 80.77 m in elevation,
as shown in Figure 1. The bays are 6.10 m on center, in both directions, with five bays in the N-S
direction and six bays in the E-W direction. For numerical study of the control purpose the finite
element model developed by Ohtori was used. Structural member nonlinearities are included in
the finite element analysis so as to capture the inelastic behavior of the building during strong
earthquakes. A bilinear hysteresis model is used to characterize the nonlinear bending stiffness of
the structural members. The damping matrix is determined by the Rayleigh damping. The first 10
natural frequencies of the evaluation model are: 0.261, 0.753, 1.30, 1.83, 2.40, 2.44, 2.92, 3.01,
3.63, and3.68 Hz.
MR Damper MR-damper has been considered as a usefully semi-active control device by
many researchers. The control device posed highly nonlinear energy dissipation capability. By
implementing different voltage change the characteristic of resisting force will change. A total of
32 MR-dampers is selected to install to this structure, as shown in Figure 2. It is assumed that
each MR damper can provide the maximum force of 140 kN. To develop the model of
MR-damper, an experimental prototype of a MR damper was provided with the capacity for
device force, stroke, and velocity are given by 7kN, 120mm, and 380mm/s, respectively [18]. To
assess the ability to predict the behavior of the MR damper, the modified bi-viscous model (see
Figure 3) is proposed. The model of the MR damper in structural control of this study is the
combination of the modified bi-viscous model and the bilinear model. The modified bi-viscous
model contains six parameters: the pre-yield viscous damping Cpr, the post-yield viscous damping
Cpo1 and Cpo2, the two yield forces f1 and f2, and yield velocity respect to the high yield force v1.
The behavior of the bi-linear model is divided into two parts: the pre-yield and the post-yield
conditions. The pre-yield damping Cpr is assumed to be much greater than the post yield damping
Cpo so as to ensure the yield force obtained at low velocity. There are four independent
parameters in the bi-linear model: fy, fu, vy, and vu . For control the command voltage is sent to the
modified bi-viscous model with the states as input and then generates the corresponding force. A
voltage constraint function with a second-order polynomial function between voltage and
commend force is used to define the lower bound of the force. If the corresponding commend
force is greater than the lower bound, the output force is still using the force generated by the
modified bi-viscous model, on the contrary, the output force is obtained from the bilinear model
translational DOFs. This reduced-order model is required to calculate the control gain by solving
the Ricatti equation through the assumption of shear-type model in this steel frame.
First Category of Control Cases
In the first category the application of fully centralized control, half-centralized control and fully
de-centralized control algorithms will be used. In fully centralized control method only one
compensator with full measurements of acceleration response from each floor is used in which
the control gain can be derived from only one objective function. The half centralized control
method also use the full measurement of acceleration response as feedback signals, but the
control gain is obtained from 16 independently objective functions. Hence, in this control system
still only one compensator is used because the control gain from various objective functions has
been combined into a complete form similar to the fully centralized control system. As for the
fully decentralized control method, it uses acceleration responses closed to the control devices as
the compensators’input. Sixteen compensators are involved in this control system; for example,
if the control device placed between the 2nd and 3rd floors and the 3rd floor acceleration response
will be used as the feedback signal to the compensator. The main difference of these three control
ceases is the collocation of the control gain and using the Kalman estimator to estimate the
full-state of the system. From the analysis of peak absolute acceleration responses and the
inter-story drift ratio, the fully decentralized control methods shows a little better reduction in
acceleration response, while the peak drift ratio value is very similar in these three cases, as
shown in Figure 5. This figure also shows the control effectiveness in reduction of base shear and
acceleration response among all control methods. Among these three methods, from practical
application the fully decentralized control is most promising. It means that the fully decentralized
control method can use limited response information to realize the semi-active control in the
structural implementation. Figure 6 shows the comparison on the story drift ratio and maximum
floor acceleration response between uncontrolled and controlled (Centralized, Half Centralized,
and Fully Decentralized control algorithms) responses under El Centro earthquake excitation.
Table 3 indicates the detailed information of control performance under four different excitations
using the evaluation criteria.
Second Category of Control Cases
The variation among these three partially decentralized control cases is the difference on the
selection of subsystems. The partially decentralized control method with uncoupled sub-system is
to divide the whole structure into four groups (in this case study) and each sub-system contains
five floors. For instance, the first group of these four subsystems involves the 1st floor to 5th floor
with four MR dampers installed in each floor from 2nd floor to 5th floor and five accelerometers.
On the other hand, the partially decentralized control method with coupled subsystems uses the
overlap DOFs between adjacent subsystems. For the same example a group of the 1st floor to 7th
1. In the decentralized control design, only local sensor information has been used to generate
the control signal that is send to the dampers of each control subsystem. The de-centralized
control algorithm can be carried out successfully for a large-scale structural system. The
simulation results demonstrate that decentralized control provides almost the same control
effectiveness (indices) as the centralized control.
2. An advantage of the decentralized control is the robustness in the face of failure of control
system during strong earthquake. Given one subsystem fails, the other subsystems can be
capable of compensating accordingly and ensure suitable global performance of the system.
3. From the example of ASCE 20-story benchmark model the application of de-centralized
control using MR-dampers to mitigate the seismic response of the building was examined.
The control effectiveness is almost the same as the centralized control but with more
robustness in the face of failure of control system due to uncertainty of external loading.
