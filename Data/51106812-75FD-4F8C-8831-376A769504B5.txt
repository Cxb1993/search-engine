require the specialists such as doctors and 
therapists to guide the rehabilitation programs. 
With the increase of population, as well as the 
patients, the labor loading is getting heavier. 
Therefore, the development of more efficient 
instruments and treatments is urgent. Because 
of the ability of reprogramming and flexibility, 
robots attract researchers’ attention to be 
applied to the rehabilitation managements. 
 
Because of the development of robotics, a 
lot of robots have been developed for the 
treatment to reduce the labor loading of 
therapists. In addition, the quantified 
information can be obtained from the electric 
devices such as encoder and load cell to 
evaluate the improvement of the patients’ 
performance. Robot technology has been 
investigated in the past decades and has been 
employed in many fields such as manufacture 
automation, surgery, security …etc. However, 
there was no papers on therapeutic robotics 
published before 1990 (Krebs and Hogan 2006). 
Except the reduction of labor in rehabilitation, 
the rehabilitation robot can also provide 
reliable measurement to evaluate the 
improvement of patients’ mobility and the 
efficacy of treatments. In addition, with the 
development of electronic devices, the robot 
can detect the motion and force of the patients’ 
extremities precisely, and provide necessary 
assistance or resistance to train the patients. 
 
One of the most well established upper limb 
rehabilitation robot is called “MIT-MANUS”, 
invented by Krebs and his group (Krebs and 
Hogan 2006). The whole system consists of 
three subsystems which are Should-and-Elbow 
Robot (Hogan, Krebs et al. 1992; Hogan, Krebs 
et al. 1993; Krebs, Hogan et al. 1998), Wrist 
Robot (Krebs, Volpe et al. 2007), and Hand 
Robot (Masia, Krebs et al. 2007). These three 
subsystems can work independently or 
cooperatively. With proper training programs, 
this group has shown that the rehabilitation 
robot, MIT-MANUS, (Krebs and Hogan 2006).  
There are other groups working on the 
development of the upper limb rehabilitation 
robots for neuro-disorder patients. Ju and his 
colleagues investigated a neuro-rehabilitation 
robot for forearm, elbow and shoulder joints 
(Ju, Lin et al. 2005). This robot also allows the 
subjects’ forearm to pronate/supinate (Kung, Ju 
et al. 2007). The patients were required to 
follow the trajectories shown on the screen with 
assistance/resistance from the robot. In addition, 
the load cell was mounted around the wrist to 
detect the torque resulting from abnormal 
synergy patterns (Kung, Ju et al. 2005; Kung, 
Lin et al. 2010). Other upper limb rehabilitation 
robots include ARM Guide (Kahn, Lum et al. 
2006), Bi-Manu-Track (Hesse, Schulte-Tigges 
et al. 2003), MIME (Lum, Burgar et al. 
2006)…etc. A review of rehabilitation was 
provided by Schmidt et al. (Schmidt, Hesse et 
al. 2004) 
 
Virtual Reality (VR) is another potential 
technology to improve the rehabilitation. With 
the development of interactive devices and 
video games such as Wii, a lot of researchers 
intended to prove the possibility of utilizing VR 
in neuro-rehabilitation and find out the 
mechanism of the neurodevelopment affected 
by VR in rehabilitation program. Studies have 
been investigated on the child with cerebral 
palsy and chronic stroke (You, Jang et al. 2005; 
You, Jang et al. 2005). However, the significant 
improvement compared to conventional 
therapy is still limited and the results are not 
convincing because of lack of experimental 
data. (Henderson, Korner-Bitensky et al. 2007; 
Adamovich, Fluet et al. 2009). 
 
In this study, we would like to develop an 
interactive rehabilitation robot for the child 
with CP. The design and establishment of the 
mechanism of the robot is the first stage of this 
research and is reported this article. As 
mentioned above, there are different 
conventional and emerging treatments and 
managements, and the combination may result 
in better efficacy. Therefore, the potential 
conjunction of other treatments such as virtual 
reality, electric stimulation, and signal feedback 
must be considered while the mechanism of the 
robot is designed. 
 
Design Concepts 
 
For the rehabilitation of neuromuscular 
disorder patients, most of the rehabilitation 
managements such as occupational therapy and 
 
Figure 3 Electromagnetic clutch (ESC015, Yan Co., Ltd, 
Taichung, Taiwan). 
 
The transmission system consists of three 
primary parts, two pulleys and one timing belt 
as shown in Figure 4. The 50-tooth pulley is 
attached to the black disc for the clutch, as 
shown in Figure 3, to engage with the motor. 
The other 110-tooth pulley is attached to a 
customized tube, which is fixed inside a ball 
bearing to reduce the resistance while the 
forearm rotates.  
 
 
Figure 4 Transmission system, including a 50-tooth 
pulley, 110-tooth pulley, and timing belt. 
 
The forearm holder consists of the elbow 
holder and the wrist fixture as illustrated in 
Figure 5. The elbow holder is a simple block to 
support elbow which the robot rotates the 
forearm. The wrist fixture can fasten the wrist 
to allow only the pronation and supination of 
the forearm. In order to reduce the friction, the 
ball bearing is utilized as shown in the 
explosive view drafting in Figure 6. The 
110-tooth pulley would transmit the motor 
power into the patient’s forearm directly, and 
the angle of rotation could be controlled by the 
stepper motor via computer program. For the 
purpose of safety, two pins are fixed on the 
back side of the wrist fixture as in shown in 
Figure 7. These two pins only allow the 
rotation in a range of 180°.

TGCS Symposium this year had a little more than 100 participants. Although it was not a big 
meeting, it was very specific to the technology and application development related to computer 
simulation. Therefore we had in depth interactions with others which could help us improve our 
musculoskeletal model simulations on cycling and ingress/egress/driving related studies. A primary 
message gained from this year’s TGCS Symposium is the importance of validation of computer 
simulation with experimental results. It remains with debates that which methods should be used to 
determine how well the simulation models perform.

For example, Prof. Tibor Hortobagyi from University of Groningen, Netherland not only asked 
several questions during my presentation and discussed common interests on stroke rehabilitation. 
We may initiate collaborative research between EU and Taiwan in the future. 
 
二、心得（可含照片） 
 
International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) is the world largest scientific biomechanics society. 
The biannual ISB congress and technical group symposium (e.g. TGCS Symposium) usually 
provide very good platforms for researchers and students to share their research findings and learn 
from the others.  This is the fifth time that I brought graduate students to attend an international 
conferences.  However, for the two master students who attended the conference with me, this is 
the first time that they presented research findings in oral sessions at an international meeting.  
They have spent a great deal of time preparing the slides.  Moreover, this is also the first time that 
they presented in English in public.  Although this was a big challenge for them, they did a good 
job on letting the audience know the primary objective and findings of our studies, and even 
drawing some people’s attention to the quality of our research.  During and after the sessions in 
which our papers were presented, several questions were raised by the audience regarding the 
design, and interpretation of data.  Chi-Yi and Yi-Cheng could respond to some questions, 
however, with the limited technical training and English speaking ability, some questions were not 
answered completed or to the extended I would like it be.   
 
As in previous meetings which I brought students with, I can certainly feel that this is a good 
opportunity and experience for them.  Since I have learned a great deal from my previous attended 
conferences and received many positive feedbacks from other senior faculty on bringing students to 
conference, I will continue encouraging students to submit their research results and present their 
findings at international conferences.  I deem this is an important aspect graduate training.  
However, this time, students did not receive any fund support from NSC or the university. I 
certainly hope that the NSC and university could encourage students to attend international 
conferences as part of the graduate training and provide some financial support. 
 
Since we are organizing a international to be held in Taiwan – 2011 International Biomechanics 
Conference and Annual Meeting of Taiwanese Society of Biomechanics, I also took this opportunity 
to learn the organization details. In addition, I also take every chance to invite researchers to submit 
papers to and attend our coming conference in Hsinchu.

This trip to two conferences provided me and my graduate students a good opportunity sharing our 
research advances and findings to researchers from all over the world. From previous and this 
successful experiences, I plan to continue encouraging students to submit research papers to 
international conferences to gain experience on presenting research in English, exchanging ideas 
with others or giving comments on other studies. With mentioned advantages on attending 
conferences, I would suggest the National Science Council, and our University and Department also 
to encourage graduate students and faculty members to get this kind of opportunity by providing 
more travel funds or other financial support.

INTRODUCTION 
Cycling is an increasingly popular recreational 
and competitive activity, and the related injuries 
are becoming more common. Similar to many 
sports, the knee is a commonly reported 
problem area for cyclists. The cycling injuries, 
such as patellofemoral syndrome that caused 
by increased pressure across the patellofemoral 
joint, is the most common cause of knee pain in 
the cyclist. However, many cycling-related 
injuries are preventable. The prevention of 
lower-limb injuries could be achieved by bicycle 
fit and alignment, proper rider position and 
pedaling mechanics, and appropriate training 
[1,2].  
 
In order to prevent lower extremity injuries and 
enhance the muscle activity level of cyclist, 
studies have reported the effects of bike 
geometric parameters and pedaling techniques 
on muscle activities and joint kinetics. However, 
most of these studies were conducted on indoor 
experimental setups by using an ergometer or 
treadmill, which presents different resistance 
and system dynamics from real-road cycling.  
 
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use an 
experimental platform (Fig. 1) for studying 
outdoor cycling, and to establish  
musculoskeletal (human)-mechanical (bike) 
model for simulating real-road cycling. 
 
 
Fig 1: Instrumented bike (outdoor experimental platform) is  
equipped  with  an  encoder,  a  load  cell  and  multi-channel 
surface EMG with a data logger. 
METHODS 
To establish musculoskeletal-mechanical model 
to simulate real-road cycling, we first  
established an outdoor experimental platform 
(instrumented bike), in a previous study, to 
quantify mechanical and biomechanical 
variables during cycling on real roads [3]. The 
instrumented bike is a full-size bicycle equipped 
with an encoder, a load cell, a magnetic reed 
switch and multi-channel surface 
electromyography (EMG) to measure crank 
angle, pedal force, bike speed, and EMGs 
simultaneously.  
 
Healthy (untrained) subjects are recruited for 
this study. Surface EMG signals were recorded 
from vastus lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF),  
tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius lateralis 
(GL) muscles, with a sampling rate of 1000Hz, 
to quantify the timing, duration, amplitude, and 
pattern of muscle activities during real-road 
cycling.  
 
Subjects perform outdoor cycling, with constant 
pedaling cadence (60 rpm), on level asphalt 
ground. The raw EMG signals were expressed 
in moving window with a time averaging period 
of 200ms. The activity level during pedaling of 
each muscle was normalized to the isometric 
maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). 
 
A full body musculoskeletal model, using 
individual anthropometric data, was then 
developed using AnyBody Package (AnyBody 
Technology, Aalborg, Denmark), with geometric 
constraints of the bicycle (CAD model) imported 
(Fig. 2), to match the real-road cycling 
conditions (experimental conditions). To 
determine the power output of the simulation 
model, we use the impedance equation derived 
by our previous study [3].

employed to induce a rapid finger adduction at 850◦/s through 
a range less than 70% of subject’s range of motion, hence to 
stretch the target muscle. A custom-designed software written 
in LabVIEW 8.2 was used to control the device and conduct 
EMG data acquisition. Subjects were instructed to perform an 
isometric contraction in the target muscle at 20% of maximum 
voluntary contraction before finger stretching and maintain the 
activation level until the end of each trial. The primary 
variable investigated here was the peak amplitude of rectified 
EMG signals induced by muscle stretch, i.e. the so-called M1 
response described in previous studies [11], and the latency of 
M1 (Figure 1). The mean peak amplitudes and latencies of M1 
of 30 trials were determined for each target muscle. Paired t 
tests were used to compare the means with to without MV.

stretch reflex response [11].  
 
C. Biomechanical Evaluation. In addition to the above-
described neurophysiological evaluations, the effects of MV 
on voluntary control finger movements were also quantified. 
Kinematics of the thumb, index and little finger of the stroke-
affected hand, performing repetitive abduction/adduction 
movements, were recorded at 250 Hz using a six-camera 
motion capture system.  An individuation index (Iind) defined 
in a previous study was employed to quantify the 
individuation of finger control [12].

where Iindj is the individuation index of the jth finger, Dij is 
the normalized path distance of the ith finger during the jth 
instructed movement in the same hand, and n is the number of 
fingers (here n=3: thumb, index and little fingers). 
 
Independent t tests were used to compare means of Iind 
calculated from 10 trials of instructed finger movement 
between each MV condition and without MV to determine 
whether changes of independent finger movement control 
occur during MV to identified location from the Corticomotor 
Excitability Evaluation experiment, where MV induced 
differential effects to the three tested muscles. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
For each stroke subject tested so far, MV to at least one 
vibration location in the stroke-affected significantly modified 
corticomotor excitability (MEP increased up to 35% as 
compared with no MV) of the pathway controlling the stroke-
affected hand and provide differential effect on the vibrated 
and non-vibrated same hand muscles (p<0.05), although large 
inter-subject variations in the vibration-induced modification 
patterns were found.   
 
Similar to the results we found in healthy individuals [13], 
muscle vibration did not significantly facilitate short-latency 
stretch-reflex responses in the stroke subjects, which implies 
that MV-induced modulations in stroke-affected motor 
pathway may occur primarily in cortical or supra-spinal level. 
 
In addition to inducing neurophysiological modulcations, MV 
to hand muscles could also improve voluntary control of 
finger movements, specifically the independent (Iind) finger 
control: Iind significantly increased 5-16% with selected 
vibration locations. 
 
Our current results demonstrate that small-amplitude muscle 
vibration can be used to facilitate corticomotor excitability and 
voluntary control of finger movements in individuals 
following stroke; hence, could be feasible for stroke 
neurorehabilitation. We are testing more subjects to provide 
more quantitative supports on this.

SUMMARY 
We examined the effects of different length of muscle 
vibration on the corticomotor excitability, using transcranial 
magnetic stimulation, and muscle selectively, employing  an 
index of selective activation, of the neural pathway controlling 
a thumb muscle, The relationship between vibration-induced 
changes of corticomotor excitability and active control of 
muscles was also quantified. The approaches and results 
provided could be used to evaluate the feasibility of using 
muscle vibration on neurorehabilitation. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Studies reported that muscle vibration could induce a rapid 
plasticity of motor cortex and increase the cortical excitability. 
Muscle vibration could facilitate motor-evoked potentials 
(MEPs), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 
in the vibrated muscle while inhibiting MEPs in neighboring 
non-vibrated muscles in healthy subjects [1], and subject’s 
attention to the stimuli could affect the vibration-induced MEP 
modulations [2]. Our previous study has also demonstrated 
that vibration-induced MEP modulations could be found in 
chronic stroke individuals, which could potentially be used to 
develop rehabilitative strategies [3]. The MEPs of these 
studies were measured during muscle vibration. However, it is 
not studied how long the duration of prolong muscle vibration 
would affect the amount of corticomotor modulations and 
muscle selectivity in the muscle after vibration. To develop 
practically feasible rehabilitative strategy using muscle 
vibration, therefore, the purpose of this study is to quantify the 
effect of vibration duration on modulations of MEP and ability 
to control finger muscle without vibration. In addition, we will 
also quantify the relationship between vibration-induced 
changes in MEP and the ability to control finger muscle. 
 
 
METHODS 
Thirteen healthy subjects (6 females; age 24.6 ± 4.19 yrs; 12 
right handed) volunteered to this study. Small amplitude 
(80Hz) muscle vibration, amplitude just below the threshold 
for perceiving tonic vibration reflex or illusory movement, 
was applied to the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle (2s 
of vibration interleaved with 2s rest) for 5, 10 and 15 minutes, 
in different dates, respectively. The order of the vibration 
duration was randomized across subjects.  
 
TMS-elicited MEPs were quantified before and after each 
vibration duration condition. Before each muscle vibration, we 
adjusted the intensity of TMS, applying to the contralateral 
cortical area controlling the APB muscle in the dominant hand, 
in order to induce MEP of approximately 1 mV, recorded by 
surface electromyography (EMG) of APB. The same TMS 
intensity was also used after vibration to quantify post-
vibration MEP at the same muscle. In addition, the subject was 
asked to perform, before and after muscle vibration, repetitive 
abduction/adduction of each finger on a horizontal plane with 
1 Hz for 10 seconds with EMG of APB was recorded. An 
index of selective activation (ISA) was then computed to 
quantify the ability to selectively control finger muscle pre- 
and post-vibration. The ISA was defined as [4]: 
 
ISA = [1- (A1/Aag + A2/Aag + A3/Aag + A4/Aag)/4] 
 
Where Aag is the average activation of APB (agonist) during 
thumb movement and A1,2,3,4 are the average activations during 
the instructed movements of the index, middle, ring and little 
fingers respectively when that muscle is not the agonist [4]. 
 
In addition to quantify MEP and ISA changes after vibration, 
we also determine the correlation between the vibration-
induced MEP and ISA changes. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Different length of muscle vibration provided different effects 
on MEP in the rested APB and ISA of APB (p<0.05). MEP 
was significantly facilitated by a five-minute muscle vibration, 
but inhibited after 15-minute vibration (p<0.05), see Figure 1. 
In addition, a five-minute muscle vibration also improved 
muscle selectivity (ISA) (Figure 2) 
 
The relationship between MEP and ISA changes could be 
represented as a second-order polynomial (p<0.05). However, 
the relationship was different between two genders. For the 
females, the relationship was regressed better with a linear 
function (p<0.05); while for the males, the relationship could

cadences – 40, 60, and 80 rpm, corresponding to 2.31, 3.47, 
and 4.62 m/s bike speed, respectively, were tested for three 
trials each with a randomized order. EMG patterns of vastus 
lateralis (VL), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF), 
gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) and pedal force are measured at 
1000Hz. EMG signals were normalized by the EMG during 
maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of each muscle; the 
pedal force was normalized by subject’s body weight.  
 
In addition to quantify muscle activities and pedal force during 
each cycling condition, we also determined a linear regression 
model to describe the correlation between muscle activities 
and resultant pedal force. The linear regress model is 
expressed as: 
 
nForce = A × nVL + B × nRF + C × nBF + D × nGL + E 
 
where nForce is normalized pedal force; nVL, nRF, nBF and 
nGL are normalized (by MVC) EMG signals of VL, RF, BF 
and GL muscles respectively. A, B, C, D and E are constants. 
Regressing analysis was performed by SPSS (SPSS Inc, USA). 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We have successfully established an instrumented bike to 
capture pedaling and biomechanical variables on real-road 
cycling. Since we are continuing testing subjects, 
representative date of one of subjects (male; age= 23 yrs; 
height= 1.71 m; weight= 61 kg; non-professional bike rider) 
are shown here. The regressions of EMGs and pedal force in 
different phases are shown in Table 1. For the top and push-
down phases, all regression (except E in the push-down phase) 
coefficients reached statistical significance level (P < 0.05). 
Therefore, we further compared the coefficients in different 
muscles and pedaling phases to determine the contribution of 
each muscle on pedal force. We found that VL was the main 
force source during the top phase, and GL was more active 
than the other muscles during the push-down phase. VL and 
BF muscles, however, were the main active muscles during 
the bottom phase.  
Previous studies showed that VL is the main power source 
during cycling [e.g. 5]; however, from our outdoor study, 
different muscles may contribute to the pedal force in different 
pedaling phases in real-road cycling. We will further conduct 
studies in various outdoor conditions to provide a more 
complete pedaling model. 
 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
We established an instrumented bike and use outdoor real-
road uphill experiments to quantify the effects of muscle 
activities of lower limbs on the pedal during outdoor cycling. 
The approach and results can be further used to construct a 
pedaling model for studying outdoor cycling or developing 
bikes.
