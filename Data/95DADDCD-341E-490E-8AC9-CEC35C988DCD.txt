Abstract
This report documents our effort and findings for the NSC project entitled “Spec-
trum sensing and management in cognitive wireless mobile networks” during the period
8/1/2008–7/31/2010. This project is part of a 3-year integrated project to study gen-
eralized opportunistic communications. Our investigation is divided into three phases
which was carried out in the past three academic years. In the first year, we focus on
analyzing the effect of spectrum sensing error on the performance of a cognitive spread
spectrum system. The sensing error may caused by unintentional interference, jamming
or simply geographic location difference between a transmitter and its intend receiver.
For the last two years we consider more on the spectrum management aspect. As we
interpret “spectrum” in the most generalized sense so that it includes all sorts of sig-
nal degrees of freedom, i.e., time, bandwidth, space, with the each domain or degree
of freedom distributed among different system users. Such an interpretation allow a
user to access other users’ unused degrees of freedom for transmitting its data. With
the generalized spectrum or network resource in mind, we set out for solving the joint
relay selection and power/subcarriers allocation problem in a relay-based cooperative
OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) communication network in the
second year. We consider a multiuser MIMO (multiple-input, multiple output) scenario
and investigate the joint spatial mode and power distribution issue in the final year. We
first study the single-carrier case and then extend to the multi-carrier case.
Since the works done in the first two years has been reported before, we just sum-
marized the main results in Chapters 2 and 3. The third year’s effort was devoted to
the study of the resource allocation problem in MIMO and MIMO-OFDMA systems,
respectively. The main design issue we try to solve is the followings. Given the users’
rate requirements of a MIMO-OFDMA system, how to apportion the transmission re-
sources in space, frequency, and user domains so that the total transmit power and each
user’s average bit error rate are minimized. We consider a orthogonal precoding scheme

Introduction
Current spectrum management policy follows a fixed band (channel) assignment
scheme which results in inefficient spectrum usage. It was observed [1] that on the
average only two percent of the allocated spectrum is actually in use at any given moment
and location. Cognitive radio (CR) which allows distributed dynamic spectrum usage
was therefore proposed to remedy such a shortcoming in spectrum management.
Based on the CR concept, Chakravarthy et al. [1] proposed a dynamic modified
direct-sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) system to which they referred as adaptive
waveform communication system (AWCS). Since the spreading sequence of AWCS is
synthesized in the transform domain, the system is also called transform domain com-
munication system (TDCS). The basic idea behind TDCS is to generate a spreading
sequence whose spectrum avoids existing users or jammers within the SS band.
In most existing works, it is assumed that the channel usage information is perfectly
known at transmitter and receiver. In practice, the spectrum conditions at transmitter
and receiver are independently estimated at both sides. If the spectrum seen (or mea-
sured) by transmitter is different from that seen at receiver, the mismatch between two
spreading sequence spectra will cause performance degradation [2]. Spectra mismatches
arise because of geographic separation and/or spectrum estimation errors, i.e., either
the “true” spectrum represented at two sides are different or the estimated spectra are
different although the spectrum representation are the same.

relay should be used. The reception quality and transmission range can be enhanced by
incorporating cooperative relays as a transmission option. Motivated by the potential
advantages, some multi-hop schemes and their performance gains have been investigated
by many and IEEE has formed a task force to develop multi-hop relay specifications for
802.16 air interface.
The problem of resource allocation in conventional OFDMA systems or in relay-
aided OFDMA system has been intensively studied. Weighted sum rate maximization
(WSRmax) and weighted sum power minimization (WSPmin) problems were considered
in [7]. The two optimization problems are solved by employing the Lagrange dual de-
composition method. A centralized utility maximization framework was considered in
[8]. By introducing a set of pricing variables as weighting factors with the goal of maxi-
mizing the utility function of the application layer, the authors solved the optimization
of physical-layer transmission strategies (relay strategies and resource allocation) in an
efficient manner. Algorithms for subcarriers/time allocation on a relay-based OFDMA
system for different frame structures such as time division or frequency division can be
found in [9]. Fairness aware adaptive resource allocation in a single-hop OFDM system
was considered in [10], [14]. They imposed the proportional fairness constraint to ensure
that each user achieve a required date rate. Li and Liu [11] used a graph theoretical ap-
proach to solve the resource allocation problem for OFDMA relay networks with fairness
constraints on relay nodes by transforming the problem into a linear optimal distribution
one.
In this year, we presents low-complexity resource allocation schemes for an OFDMA
network with an aim to maximize the overall sum rate with fairness and QoS constraints.
We regard sub-carriers, relays and transmission power as part of the radio resource so
that the problem of resource allocation becomes that of relay selection and sub-carriers
and power assignments. Since this context of the first and second year has been reported
before, we only show the main results, simulations and conclusions in chapter 2.

Performance Analysis of Transform
Domain Communication Systems in
the Presence of Spectral Mismatches
2.1 Introduction to TDCS
The basic idea behind TDCS is to produce a so-called time-domain fundamental modula-
tion waveform (FMW) or a complex spreading sequence which avoids interference from
existing users or jammers by dynamically selecting the subcarriers used over a given
bandwidth. A block diagram of the TDCS transmitter is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. The
transmitter partitions the signal band into N equal-spaced subbands (tones) and per-
forms spectrum estimation to determine which subbands are being used. The spectrum
estimator output is anN -dimensional binary vectorAx = (Ax(ω0), Ax(ω1), · · · , Ax(ωN−1))
with Ax(ωi) = 1 or 0 depending on whether the ith subband is available (1) or not (0).
The subscript x will be Tx or Rc to denote if the vector is associated with the trans-
mitter (Tx) or the receiver (Rc). The binary vector ATx is multiplied element-wise by a
user-specific random vector (ejθ(ωi)) and scaled by constant factor before being inverse
discrete Fourier transformed to produce the time-domain FMW. The multiplication of
the random vector is to make the FMW noise-like and to provide the multiple access
capability. The FMW is used to spread (or as a carrier of) the binary phase shift keying
(BPSK) or cyclic code shift keying (CCSK) modulated data sequence.

mismatches as network geography induced spectra mismatches. Such mismatches are
most likely to occur when the distance between two sides of the link is large. To simplify
our analysis we define the true spectrum as such that no existing user is interfered by
the transmitted signal and the received waveform is not interfered by any existing user
if error-free spectrum estimates are available on both sides of the link.
The true spectrum represented by the binary-valued N -dimensional vector A =
(A(ω0), A(ω1), · · · , A(ωN−1)), where N is the size of inverse discrete fourier transform
(IDFT), is thus related to the error-free spectrum estimates AoTx and A
o
Rc via A =
AoTx ∧AoRc, where ∧ denotes component-wise logical “and” operation.
We assume that A(ωi) = 0 with probability 1− Psa and A(ωi) = 1 with probability
Psa. Obviously, eight possible scenarios may occur, as listed in Table 2.1. For Cases 1,
and 3, interference from existing users is present. In Cases 1 and 5, (additional) noise
within the subband ω will be received. The received signal energy is reduced in Cases 2
and 6.

2.4 Chapter Summary
CR has attracted much interest because of its potential to greatly enhance the spectrum
utilization efficiency. TDCS is a novel new candidate SS technique that invokes the CR
concept. In the first year, we consider the effect of spectra mismatches due to spectral
estimation error. BER expressions for BPSK signals in various operating conditions are
given. We also derive analytical SER expressions for other modulations like MPSK,
QAM signals and flat Rayleigh fading channels. Our analysis can easily be extended
to other flat-fading channels by deriving the corresponding Ps(x). It is shown that the
spectral estimation error results in error floor. As expected, the BER/SER performance
is improved and the error floor is reduced when the per-tone (single-subcarrier) detection
error decrease. Increasing the number of subcarriers (processing gain) in the SS band
also has similar effect. Based on this, it suggests that the best access police is to choice
all subbands in terms of BER/SER if the subbands are estimated as idle state. We also
find that the BER/SER performance is more sensitive to the spectral estimation error
at the receiver than that at the transmitter.
There are quite a few issues that remain to be solved. Firstly, we use a simple
Bernoulli distribution to model the estimation error, which is appropriate if the spectral

Dynamic Resource Allocation for
Relay-based OFDMA Systems with
Fairness Considerations
3.1 System Model
We consider an N -subcarrier OFDMA system in which there is a BS, M fixed relay
nodes, and K MS’ randomly distributed within a cell. Assume that uplink channel
state information is perfectly known to the BS which also knows the minimum rate and
QoS (bit error rate) requirements of the MSs. The BS, acts as a central control device,
will carry out all resource allocation operations, including collecting link information,
appropriating resources, and informing MS’ about their assigned resources. Similar
to the conventional relay-based cooperative communication systems, we assume a two-
phase (time-slot) transmission scheme with perfect timing synchronization among all
network users. Each subcarrier suffers from slow Rayleigh fading so that there is no
change of the channel state during a two-phase period. A data stream from a source
user must be carried by the same subcarrier no matter it is transmitted by a source node
or a relay node.
The transmission pattern is half-duplex such that a MS transmits while the relay
and the BS listen (receive) in the first time slot. In the second phase, the relay stations
transmit to the BS while the source MS’ send new data packets via direct links without
15
the total consumed energy. For convenience, we shall normalize a time slot to one so
that henceforth the consumed energy is equivalent to the consumed power. Because the
channel states are assumed to remain the same during any two time-slot period, the
power allocated to the direct link on each time slot should be the same. The power
(consumed energy) for two OFDM symbols can thus be expressed as
PD(n, k) = 2
(
2R(n,k)/2 − 1) Γσ2|hSD(n, k)|2 (3.4)
where PD(n, k) is the power needed for the direct link, and R(n, k) is the rate achievable
by the system for a duration of two symbol intervals. Similarly, the signal carried by
the nth subcarrier and received by the mth relay for the kth MS is given by
ySRm(n, k) = hSRm(n, k)xk + n(n, k). (3.5)
In the first phase, the kth MS sends xk to the mth relay with a achievable rate of
RSRm(n, k) = log2
[
1 +
PSRm(n, k)|hSRm(n, k)|2
Γσ2
]
(3.6)
or equivalently, this source-to-relay (SR) link rate can only be achieved if the source
power is greater than or equal to
PSRm(n, k) =
(
2RSRm (n,k) − 1) Γσ2|hSRm(n, k)|2 . (3.7)
Relay nodes transmit the data packet to destination in the second phase. The destination
node receives two scaled packets containing the same data stream and combines them
by the maximum-ratio-combining (MRC) scheme. The achievable MRC rate of the kth
user on subcarrier n with the help of perfectly decoding relay m is
RRm(n, k) = log2[
1 +
PSRm(n, k)|hSD(n, k)|2 + PR(n,m)|hRD(n,m)|2
Γσ2
]
(3.8)
The corresponding minimum required relay power is thus given by
PR(n,m) =
(2RRm (n,k) − 1)Γσ2 − PSRm(n, k)|hSD(n, k)|2
|hRD(n,m)|2 (3.9)
17
less power to obtain the same achievable rate. (3.2), (3.6) and (3.8) imply that this
happens iff
gRmD(n, k) > gD(n, k)
max
m
gSRm(n, k) > gD(n, k) (3.16)
The above conditions are necessary but not sufficient for the DF scheme under consid-
eration, which gives another necessary condition
gRm(n, k) > gD(n, k) (3.17)
or, if multiple relay nodes are available
max
m
gRm(n, k)
def
= gR(n, k) > gD(n, k) (3.18)
i.e., at least one of the candidate composite link should have a link gain greater than
that of the direct (SD) link. Assuming the optimal power ratio (3.15), we can show that
a necessary and sufficient condition for a single-relay system is
gSRm − gD
gSRm + gRmD − gD
gRmD − gD
g2D
=
gRm − gD
g2D
> γ (3.19)
where γ = PD(n,k)
4Γσ2
and the link gains’ dependence on the pair (n, k) is omitted for the
sake of brevity. For multiple-relay systems, (3.19) becomes
max
m
gRm − gD
g2D
def
= max
m
Gm > γ (3.20)
It verifiable that the conditions (3.18) and (3.20) are equivalent if PD(n, k)αD(n, k)/2≪
1.
The achievable sum rate of the system over a two-symbol interval for a subcar-
rier/power allocation is thus given by
R =
K∑
k=1
{∑
n∈SR
ρnk log
[
1 + PRm(n,k)(n, k)αRm(n,k)(n, k)

3.3 Proposed algorithms
Two suboptimal algorithms to solve the above resource allocation problem (3.24)-(3.26)
are presented in this section. For convenience, we refer to these two algorithms as
Algorithms A and B, respectively. Algorithm A consists of four steps while the other
algorithm (Algorithm B) has three steps only. Steps 2 and 3 for both algorithms are
the same. The difference between the two algorithms is the first step. The last step of
Algorithm A is to fine-tune the relay allocation. Each source node can have multiple
cooperative relay nodes which are determined in a per-subcarrier basis. However, each
subcarrier is limited to have at most one relay node but the local optimal relay node
(for a particular subcarrier) is always selected for cooperative DF transmission. The
Algorithms A and B are summary in Table 3.1 and 3.2, respectively and the principle
of design can be found in the previous report.

runs were carried out to estimate the performance. We compare the sum rate and
fairness performance of our algorithms with that of the Awad-Shen (AS) algorithm [16].
Because the AS algorithm considers amplify-and-forward cooperative relay and allow
each source to use at most one relay node, we modify it so that the comparison with
ours is as fair as possible. The modified AS algorithm is listed in Table 3.3.
In Fig. 3.2 and Fig. 3.3 we compare the performance of our algorithms that of the
optimal sum rate algorithm and the algorithm in [16]. We assume that the system has 2
MSs and 3 relay nodes. The number of subcarriers are 8, the total power is 80 and the
required BER is 0.001. We find that our algorithms achieve about 94% of the optimal
sum rate and the fairness index is significant better than that achievable by the optimal
sum rate algorithm. This is because the latter does not consider the fairness index and

presented in [16] is about 1% higher than ours while our fairness index is much better.

higher while suffers from 30% loss of fairness performance. 3.3 and 3.5 indicate that our
fairness index is robust against the system parameters variation but the algorithm of [16]
is not. Our algorithms have another advantage against the AS algorithm 3.4, i.e., when
the minimum rate requirements are 80 (bits), our algorithms are capable of providing an
allocation solution such that all MS rate requirements are met while the AS algorithm
fails to do so. Algorithm B outperforms Algorithm A since the latter suffers from a little
performance loss in step one. Algorithm B achieves a better performance at the expense
of higher computation complexity though. In short, both proposed algorithms offer a
satisfactory balance between maximizing the sum rate and the fairness performance.
3.5 Chapter Summary
Cooperative relays provide additional transmission opportunities and offer the potential
to improve overall system capacity, throughput and the coverage range of a BS. It is thus
25
natural to regard relay stations as part of the network radio resource and their allocation
should be considered in conjunction with other conventional radio resources to optimize
the system performance. We have proposed two algorithms that maximize the sum rate
and fairness while meeting the individual user’s minimum rate requirement. No optimal
solution to the problem discussed here is known, and our computational complexity is
much less than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that our low-complexity
algorithms not only achieve 94% of the optimal sum rate but also provide very robust
fairness no matter what the minimum rate constraints are. The proposed algorithms
also provide powerful allocation to meet the highly minimum rate constraints for all
users.

scheme, we use the SVD to obtain the basis of the precoding vectors.
4.2 System Parameters and Transceiver Model
Consider a MIMO-OFDMA system with a single base station (BS) equipped with Tx
antennas and K mobile station (MS) users, each equipped with Rx antennas. The
frequency band used contains M subcarriers which are to be allocated to the K MS’.
Besides orthogonal subcarriers, such a system provides additional spatial channels for
transmission.
Let the kth MS’ channel matrix for subcarrier m be denoted by the Rx × Tx matrix
Hmk. Applying SVD to Hmk gives
Hmk = UmkΛmkV
†
mk (4.1)
whereUmk contains the left singular vectors ofHmk andUm,k contains the right singular
vectors of Hmk. Λmk is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries being the singular
values (SVs). In order to separate the signals from different user perfectly the proposed
scheme provides at most R eigen-channels on the same subcarrier where R is the rank
of the MIMO channel matrix. (Here we assume that the channel matrices of all users
are all full rank. Although there are still the case that the channel matrix may be rank-
deficient due to the spatial correlation, we can still suppose the channel matrix be full
rank with some negligible eigenmode magnitudes.) It is well known that the right and
left singular vectors can be used as the pre-processing and post-processing vectors such
that the receiver can easily extract the data symbol without interference.
Define the eigenchannel coefficient Armk by Armk = 1 if user k is to use the mth
subcarrier’s rth eigenchannel and Armk = 0, otherwise. Then the received signal corre-
sponds to subcarrier m of user k can be expressed as

eigenchannel on subcarrier m, we should have

Our design philosophy is to force the user whose candidate transmit channels have
weaker eigenmodes to “fit” the user(s) with stronger eigenmodes by transmitting over
an eigenchannel which lies within the dual space of the space spanned by all previously
selected eigenchannels. Each new eigenchannel is obtained by using proper processing
vectors which are linear combinations of known eigenvectors. The process is similar to a
Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process except that the process follows the descend-
ing eigen-magnitude order. Hence, a precoder based on the above design procedure is
henceforth referred to as a Gram-Schmidt (GS) precoder. Once the assignment and the
orthogonalizing weighting coefficients of the first r eigenchannels are determined, the
corresponding GNR can be computed accordingly.
4.3.2 Non-orthogonal signal processing scheme
In the previous subsection, we consider MIMO systems that use a orthogonal precoding
scheme so that system users can transmit through distinct eigenchannels on the same
subcarrier without causing interference to each other. For such a scheme, however, the
maximum eigenchannel number is bounded by the rank of the MIMO channel matrix (R)
and thus the spectrum efficiency may be constrained. To increase the spectrum efficiency,
we allow more than R users to transmit over the eigenchannels on the same subcarrier. In
this situation, the co-channel interference among users is no longer avoidable. Therefore,
the associated optimization problem becomes more complicated due to the constraints
on the tolerable inter-channel interference (ICI).
Based on the GS precoder design, we provide R − 1 orthogonal eigenchannels for
users with no interference and additional Q (R ∼ R + Q − 1) eigenchannels with var-
ious tolerable interference levels. For the R − 1 orthogonal eigenchannels, the way to
choose the pre-processing and post-processing vectors is the same as that described in
previous subsection. That is, for the user to whom the rth eigenchannel is given, the
pre-processing and post-processing vectors are the linear combinations of first r left and
33
total transmit power of the system is minimized while the QoS of each user is satisfied.
Let Rk be the rate requirement for user k (bits/per OFDM symbol) and brmk the
number of bits transmitted over the mth subcarrier using the rth eigenchannel. bmax de-
notes the maximum bit number (the highest modulation order) allowed to be carried by
an eigenchannel. Moreover, let b′mk and p
′
mk be the number of bits and the correspond-
ing power transmitted over the mth subcarrier using the non-orthogonal eigenchannel
by user k. The RA problem can then be stated as

represents user k’s target BER and f(·, ·, ·) usually has a closed-form expression. If an
M -ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M -QAM) is employed, then f(·, ·, ·) or prmk
is given by [35]

Moreover, the optimization problem becomes the orthogonal scheme via modifying

We first determine the required eigenchannel number for each user and assign the
eigenchannels to the users using a modified version of the two-phase algorithm of [36]-
[37]. Then we use the conventional bit-loading algorithm to allocate bits over each user’s
eigenchannel subset and compute the required transmit power.

eigenchannel number for each user.

Use the conventional bit-loading algorithm to 
allocate bits over each user's eigenchannel subset.
Compute the required transmit power.
Figure 4.1: Flow Chart Description of Algorithm I.
In the first phase we compute the required eigenchannel number for each user accord-
ing to the QoS and the average channel condition. For each subcarrier, say, the mth, we
sort the maximum eigenmodes λmax(k,m) of the channel matrices Hmk, k = 1, 2, · · · , K
in descending order, i.e.,
λmax(k1,m) > λmax(k2,m) > · · · > λmax(kK ,m),
where
ki = arg max
k∈IK\{k1,k2,ki−1}
λmax(k,m), and IK = {1, 2, · · · , K}
and set Armk = 1 if k = kr. If R < K we set ARmk = 1 for those k = ki, i > R.
The computing of the weighting coefficients and the corresponding GNR follow that
37
is allowed. When assign rth eigenchannel on all subcarriers, we first sort the user on
each subcarrier according to their GNRmr(k) in descending order and denote the largest
GNRmr(k) on the mth subcarrier as Qm and then sort subcarriers according to Qm in
descending order. Once the order of the subcarrier is determined, we assign the eigen-
channel to the user with largest GNR; see Table 4.2 for details. After finishing channel
assignment, we use the conventional bit-loading algorithm to allocate bits and compute
the corresponding required transmit power for each user. This algorithm initially allo-
cates zero bit to all subcarriers and then allocates bit by bit to the subcarrier which
requires the least additional transmit power. The allocation process repeats until all
data rate requirements are satisfied. The details of the bit-loading algorithm is given in
Table 4.3. For a given set of assigned eigenchannels, the proposed bit-loading algorithm
is optimal which we summarize below.
Lemma 4.5.1. For a fixed eigenchannel assignment, the bit allocation algorithm de-
scribed by Table 4.3 is optimal, i.e., it results in minimum power consumption.
Proof. For the given BER and the GNR of the eigenchannel assigned to user k, define
∆f(brmk) as
∆f(brmk) =
{
f(BERk, brmk, GNRmr(k))− f(BERk, brmk − 1, GNRmr(k)), if brmk ≥ 1
f(BERk, brmk, GNRmr(k))− f(BERk, 0, GNRmr(k)), if brmk < 1
The author of [38] introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for a discrete bit allo-
cation to be optimal:
1. ∆f(brmk) ≤ ∆f(br′m′k + 1) ∀r, r′ = 1, 2, . . . , R , ∀m,m′ = 1, 2, . . . ,M (efficient)
2.
R∑

brmk = Rk (B-tight)
Any bit distribution that satisfies the above conditions is an optimal solution. The
second condition is clearly satisfied since the bit-loading algorithm will not stop until
the loaded bits achieve the user data rate requirement. As for the first condition, we
first show that ∆f(brmk + 1) > ∆f(brmk) for all r, m and k. Since we use a closed form

later. Another advantage of this algorithm is that it considers not only the fairness but
also the efficiency of the resource utilization. In step 1, we insure that every user is
assigned enough eigenchannels to transmit data so that outage will not occur. In step 2,
we assign eigenchannels to the user who has the highest eigenmode magnitude, making
the most of the available spatial resources.

nels and modified bit-loading algorithm

Here a ≽ b means the inequality holds element-wise. Then we can compute pm by
pm = (I−Cm)−1ym ∀ m. (4.38)
If the solution pm is all-positive then it is a feasible solution that satisfies (4.34). Oth-
erwise, no feasible solution exists. The authors of [40] also show that if the solution of
(4.34) exists and the elements of the solution vector are all positive, the Perron eigen-
value (that is, the largest positive eigenvalue) of Cm, denoted as λ(Cm), must be less
than 1. In addition, pm computed by (4.38) is the Pareto optimal solution to (4.34).
In other words, any positive vector that satisfies (4.34) is greater than or equal to pm
element-wise. The modified bit-loading algorithm is now described as follows:

4.6.2 Simulation Results
In this subsection, we evaluate the performance of the non-orthogonal precoding scheme
and compare it with the performance of the orthogonal precoding scheme (using the
space/frequency allocation algorithm).
The performance of the non-orthogonal precoding scheme and the orthogonal precod-
ing scheme for downlink transmissions with different channel matrix rank value is shown
in Fig. 4.2-4.4, respectively. The average power is normalized by that of the single-user
case, i.e., when a single user has access to all eigenchannels and all subcarriers. We
define the average power ratio at BER=B as :
PB = 10 log10
(
Pavg,B
Pavg,10−5,single
)
(4.39)
where Pavg,B represents the average transmit power for a given modulation scheme at
BER=B and Pavg,10−5,single represents the average transmit power for the single user case
at BER=10−5.
We assume the number of the antenna at the BS and the MS are the same. The
antenna number is from 3 to 5. Each entry of the channel matrix is i.i.d. zero-mean, unit-
variance complex Gaussian The system has eight different modulation modes, BPSK,
QPSK, 8QAM, 16QAM, 32QAM, 64QAM, 128QAM and 256 QAM, respectively. For
simplicity, we assume that the required data rate and BER are the same for all users.
We can notice that when the rank of the channel matrix is 3, the performance of the
non-orthogonal precoding scheme is about 1 dB worse than the orthogonal precoding

5.1.1 System parameters and transceiver model
Again, we consider the uplink of a MIMO-OFDMA system with Rx transmit antennas
at the base station and Tx receiver antennas at mobile stations. The frequency band is
divided into M subcarriers. For the kth MS on the mth subcarrier, a bit stream is sent
into a vector encoder and modulator block where it is demultiplexed into N different
substreams. Each of the N bit substreams is then modulated independently using the
same constellation W . This yields a symbol vector of smk = [s1mk s2mk . . . sNmk]T . For
convenience, we will assume that E[s†mksmk] = IN .
The symbol vector smk is then multiplied by an Tx ×N precoding matrix Fmk pro-
ducing a length Tx vector xmk =
√
Em
N
Fmksmk where Em is the total transmit energy
on the subcarrier m, Tx is the number of transmit antennas, and Tx > N . We assume
throughout the correspondence that Rx > M . Assuming perfect timing, synchroniza-
tion, sampling, and a memoryless linear matrix channel, this formulation allows the
baseband, discrete-time equivalent received signal to be written as
ymk =
√
Em
N
HmkFmksmk + vmk (5.1)
where Hmk is the channel matrix and vmk is the noise vector. We assume that the the
entries of vmk are independent and distributed according to CN (0, No). The received
vector is then decoded by a vector decoder, assuming perfect knowledge of HmkFmk ,
that produces a hard decoded symbol vector ˆsmk.
In this correspondence, the BS chooses a precoding matrix Fmk from a finite set of
possible precoding matrices F = [F1 F2 . . . FL] and conveys the index of the chosen
precoding matrix back to the transmitter over a limited capacity , zero-delay feedback
link.
At the receiver side, we consider linear receivers such as Zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and
MMSE receiver instead of the ML receiver due to the lower complexity of linear receivers.
Linear receivers apply an N × Rx matrix Gmk, chosen according to some criterion, to
51
5.2 Problem Formulation
Instead of minimizing the total transmit power or maximizing the overall system capacity
(throughput), we now choose to minimize the average BER performance with user peak
power constraints and proportional subcarrier number fairness.
In order to avoid co-channel interference (CCI), we adopt the single-user-per-subcarrier
policy, allowing each subcarrier to serve one user only. Define the subcarrier coefficient
Cmk and let Cmk = 1 if user k is to transmit on the mth subcarrier and Cmk = 0,
otherwise. Denote the transmit power of the nth substream on the mth subcarrier of
user k as pmnk. Then resource allocation problem is equivalent to solving the following
optimization problem.

mth subcarrier as Qm and then sort subcarriers according to Qm in descending order.
Once the order of the subcarrier is determined, we assign the subcarrier to the user with
largest minimum substream SNR. If that user has been assigned enough subcarriers,
then the current subcarrier will assigned to the remained users with largest minimum
substream SNR. The detail can be checked in Table 5.1.

5.3.2 The Power Loading Scheme
In the previous subsection, we assume that the total power of user k is equally distributed
to the all substreams on the subcarriers assigned to the user k and perform dynamic
subcarrier assignment to extract the diversity gain of multiuser MIMO-OFDMA systems.

Thus, the corresponding power can then be computed. It is noted that if some sub-
streams’ power is negative after the computation, it means that the GNRs of these
substream are too low and these substreams should not be allocated any power in order
not to deteriorate the overall performance. In such case, we should exclude these sub-

are not negative.
5.4 Complexity Analysis and Numerical Results
5.4.1 Computational Complexity Analysis
In this subsection, we analyze the complexity of the subcarrier assignment algorithm
and the power loading algorithm.
For the subcarrier assignment algorithm, the complexity of step 2 is O(KNlog2N +
MKlog2K+Mlog2M), and for step 3 the complexity is O(MK), so the total complexity
of the subcarrier assignment algorithm is O(KNlog2N+MKlog2K+Mlog2M+MK) =
O(MKlog2K). And for the power loading algorithm, the complexity is O(NM).
5.4.2 Numerical Results
Selected simulated performance of the proposed resource allocation algorithm are pre-
sented in this subsection. First the performance of the subcarrier assignment algorithm
for the codebook based MIMO-OFDAM systems is shown in Fig. 5.1-5.4. For Fig.
5.5-5.7, we evaluate the performance of the proposed power-loading algorithm.
We assume each Hmk is a 4× 2 (4 antennas at the BS and 2 antennas at each MS)
matrix for 2 substream codebook and 4 × 3 (4 antennas at the BS and 3 antennas at
57
channel condition is much larger. Simulation results show that the variance of GNR is
reduced by almost 50% after precoding. Therefore, the performance gain offered by the
power-loading algorithm is smaller in the other two cases.

Conclusion
In this report, we first review the work of the first and second year and the detail
can be found in the previous reports. In the final year, we consider the allocation
of radio resources in a MIMO-OFDMA system. It is critical in maximizing resource
efficiency, system capacity, and mitigating interference. We have presented two SVD-
based precoding schemes (orthogonal and non-orthogonal precoding) that minimize the
total consumed power while meeting various rate and SINR requirements. Since the
orthogonal precoding scheme is applied only when the number of user is small or equal
to the rank of channel, we extend our concern to non-orthogonal precoding schemes
that guarantee zero or limited co-channel interference to further increase the spectrum
efficiency. An adaptive resource allocation algorithm is proposed and its numerical
performance is given. It is found that the lift of the orthogonal constraint leads to
improved performance when the rank of the channel matrix is sufficient.
We also consider the resource allocation issue for spatial multiplexing systems with
limited feedback (codebook based precoding) and present subcarrier assignment and
power loading algorithms that minimize the average BER performance. The simulation
results show that these dynamic resource allocation methods do indeed yield low average
BER performance.
Some results in these three years have also been published in conferences and the
associated information are listed below.

Abstract— In this paper, we apply simulation-based optimiza-
tion methods to detect quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM)
MIMO signals. The first one is the so-called Cross-Entropy (CE)
method which enables the corresponding CE-based detector to
provide bit-error-rate (BER) performance close to that achievable
by the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector when the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) is relatively low. Unfortunately, the perfor-
mance curves exhibit error floors in the high SNR region. To
improve the performance in the high SNR region, we borrow
the concept of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and refer
to the resulting iterative detector as the Particle-Swarm-driven
Cross-Entropy (PSD-CE) MIMO detector. This detector gives a
significant BER performance improvement in the medium-to-
high SNR region. We also consider the case when the channel
state information is imperfect and suggest a robust detector
structure based on a modified score function.
I. INTRODUCTION
Wireless communications are impaired predominantly by
multipath fading [1]. However, in a richly scattered fading en-
vironment, fading can be beneficial as it promises a multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) system to achieve significant
capacity gain through independent spatial modes [2]. For this
reason, the MIMO technology has gained enormous popularity
and attracted much research interest over the past decade [1].
Depending on the operating environment, a MIMO system
possesses the potential to obtain (1) array gain, (2) spatial
diversity gain, (3) spatial multiplexing gain and (4) interfer-
ence reduction capability [1], [2]. Although these advantages
cannot exist simultaneously due to conflicting demands on
the spatial degrees of freedom, some combinations across a
wireless network could improve the system performance such
as capacity and reliability.
Encouraged by the collective behavior of social animals
such as bird flocking and fish schooling, many genetic algo-
rithms have been studied. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
developed by Kennedy and Eberhart [3], is discovered through
simplified social model simulation and is an iterative algorithm
based on the social-psychological model of social influence
and learning [4]. The collective behaviour that the individuals
of a particular swarm displays is similar to discovering the
optimal regions of a high dimensional search space. At each
iteration, every individual determines its nearest neighbor and
replaces its velocity with that of its neighbor’s. To further
extend the model, the ”rooster” concept of Heppner and
Grenander [5] was included, thus recording both the previous
and neighborhood best positions. The previous (personal) best
position of each individual is the best position found by that
individual since the first simulation to the current iteration.
The neighborhood best position is the best position found by
the neighborhood. These two best positions serve as attractors
and the resulting model was referred to as Particle Swarm
Optimization. The swarm algorithm exhibits adaptive behavior
since the state changes when personal best and global best
positions change.
The Cross-Entropy (CE) method is a general Monte
Carlo approach to solve combinatorial and continuous multi-
extremal optimization problems. The name is derived from
the cross-entropy distance (or the Kullback-Leibler distance)
[6], which defines the distance between two probability density
functions. This method was animated by an adaptive algorithm
including the idea of minimizing variance for estimating
probabilities of rare events in complex stochastic networks
[7]. Soon after the first exploration, it was found that a simple
modified version could be used not only for estimating the
probabilities of rare events but for solving difficult combinato-
rial optimization problems as well. This is done by translating
an originally deterministic optimization problem into a related
stochastic estimation problem and applying the rare-event
simulation mechanism [8].
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
II provides a brief summary of the system model and the
assumptions made. Particle Swarm Algorithm is introduced in
section III. In the subsequent sections, the concepts of Cross-
Entropy-based MIMO signal detection as well as the Particle-
Swarm-Driven Cross-Entropy MIMO detection method are
proposed. Simulation results are given in section VI and
finally, the conclusion.

II. SYSTEM MODEL
Consider a MIMO system with NT transmit antennas and
NR receive antennas (NR > NT ). Input data is demultiplexed
into NT substreams and mapped onto sequences of M -QAM
symbols. The set of candidate signals in the constellation
is denoted by AM . These substreams are transmitted simul-
taneously and received synchronously. For convenience but
3The CE method attempts to solve the following optimization
function
argmax
ω∈Ω
S(ω) (11)
where Ω is the domain of variable ω and S is the score
function of ω defined on Ω. Applying IS to this problem, we
find another set of parameters, e.g. v instead of ω. To find
the optimal importance distribution within a class of densities
f(ω; v), we adapt the parameter v iteratively so that the
Kullback-Leibler distance (i.e. the cross entropy) between the
associated density and the optimal importance distribution is
minimized. In general, a generic CE method can be described
by the following steps:
1) Generate samples according to the importance distribu-
tion determined at the previous iteration.
2) Calculate the scores of the generated samples according
to a specific score function.
3) Update the importance distribution by the samples with
comparatively better scores (which is called the elite
set).
4) Repeat the above steps until the stopping criterion is
reached.
B. Cross-Entropy-based MIMO Signal Detection
To apply the CE method to a MIMO system, we first define
a score function
S(x) = ‖y −Hx‖2 (12)
under the assumption of perfect channel estimation to solve
the following optimization problem,
arg min
x∈ANTM
‖y −Hx‖. (13)
Following the procedures of the CE method, the importance
distribution of x with relatively smaller scores are estimated by
minimizing the distance between the initial distribution and the
optimal importance distribution. The estimated transmit signal
xˆ is the symbol that is most likely to occur according to the
distribution or the sample with the smallest score during the
whole process. Intuitively, xˆ is regarded as a sample and the
score will be calculated. However, there are MNT possible
candidates if we treat every vector as a sample unit. Thus, a
large sample size may be required to cover a wider search
region so that the computing complexity would inevitably
increase. To avoid this problem, the importance distribution of
every element in a transmit signal x is estimated separately.
Let f (k)(xi) denote the importance distribution of the ith
element for i = 1, . . . , NT , where the superscript k is the
index of iteration. U samples, xki,u for u = 1, . . . , U , are
generated at the kth iteration in accordance with f (k)(xi)
for the ith element. To calculate the scores for these sam-
ples, a vector set {xku}Uu=1 is constructed where xku =
[xk1,u, . . . , x
k
i,u, . . . , x
k
NT ,u
]T represents the uth sample vector
at the kth iteration.
Given a specific quantile probability ρ, there are a infinite
number of thresholds such that the probability of the scores
less or equal to these thresholds are larger or equal to ρ.
Fig. 1. BER performance of the ML detector and the CE-based detector
with α = 0.3.
To select elite samples, we choose the threshold at the kth
iteration γk satisfying
γk = argmin
γ
P (S(Z) ≤ γ) ≥ ρ for Z ∈ {xku}Uu=1. (14)
The elite samples are those whose scores satisfy S(xku) ≤ γk.
The distributions of elite samples are calculated as
f (k)s (xi = a) =
∑U
u=1 I{S(xku)≤γk}I{xki,u=a}∑U
u=1 I{S(xku)≤γk}
(15)
where a ∈ AM for i = 1, . . . , NT . Based on these elite sam-
ples, the importance distributions f (k)(xi) for i = 1, . . . , NT
are updated according to
f (k+1)(xi = a) = αf (k)s (xi = a)+(1−α)f (k)(xi = a) (16)
where 0 ≤ α < 1 is the weighting factor. The updated
importance distributions are linear combinations of the orig-
inal importance distributions and the distribution of the elite
samples. The procedure described above is repeated iteratively
until the stopping criterion is met.
Fig. 1 shows the BER performance of the ML detector and
the CE-based detector in a 4 × 4 MIMO system using 4-
QAM. The performance of both detectors is almost identical
in the low SNR region but the CE detector results in an error
floor when the SNR is larger than 10 dB. This is because the
estimated importance distributions do not converge uniformly,
i.e., only some but not all the NT importance distributions
converge.
V. A PARTICLE-SWARM-DRIVEN CE DETECTOR
Inspired by the concept of swarm algorithm, the updating
formula of importance distribution, i.e. equation (16), in the
CE-based MIMO detection method is modified to solve the
problem of nonuniform convergence mentioned previously.
The main idea is to keep the newly generated samples close to
the samples with the best scores. Except for the elite samples
generated in the current iteration, we enhance the effect of
sample vectors with the best score among all iterations so far.
The updated importance distribution thus becomes a mixture
of distributions determined by the current elite set, the current
best sample vector(s) and the overall best sample vector(s).

x by maximizing the likelihood function under i.i.d. Gaussian
noise :
xˆML = arg max
x∈ANTM
L(y|H,x)
= arg min
x∈ANTM
(− logL(y|H,x))
= arg min
x∈ANTM
‖y −Hx‖. (24)
However, when imperfect channel estimation is taken into
account, the score function must be modified in the presence
of channel estimation errors. Denote by Lm(y|Hˆ,x) the
generalized likelihood function which is obtained by taking
average of L(y|H,x) over all estimation errors [10]
Lm(y|Hˆ,x) =
∫
H∈CNR×NT
L(y|H,x)p(H|Hˆ)dH
= EH|Hˆ
[
L(y|H,x|Hˆ)
]
= CN (δHˆx,Σw + δΣΔH‖x‖2) (25)
Hence the ML estimator [10] is revised as
xˆML = arg min
x∈ANTM
[
− logLm(y|Hˆ,x)
]
= arg min
x∈ANTM
[
NR log π(σ2w + δσ
2
ΔH‖x‖2)
+
‖y − δHˆx‖2
σ2w + δσ2ΔH‖x‖2
]
. (26)
and the score function is modified as
fm(x,y, Hˆ)  − logLm(y|Hˆ,x)
=
‖y − δHˆx‖2
σ2w + δσ2ΔH‖x‖2
+NR log π(σ2w + δσ
2
ΔH‖x‖2). (27)
The first term in (27) is similar to the original score function.
It also indicates that the modified score function only includes
the term σ2ΔH instead of other detailed information about
estimation errors.

VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
A MIMO system with NT = 4 and NR = 4 with 4-QAM
or 8-QAM modulation is considered. Let Eb be the average
received energy per information bit and N0 the noise power
density. The signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) is defined as
Eb
N0
=
NR
log2(M)σ2w
.
We first consider the scenario that the channel matrix is
perfectly known by the receiver. Fig. 3. shows the bit error
rate (BER) performance of the CE-based detector with α = 0.3
and the PS-driven CE detector with α1 = α2 = 0.1, α3 = 0.2
and β = 0.3. It is obvious that the proposed PS-driven CE
detection algorithm can effectively mitigate the nonuniform
convergence effect in the CE-based detection algorithm. The
error floors associated with the CE-based detector’s perfor-
mance curves at high SNRs are almost eliminated. We then
compare the BER performance of some existing MIMO signal
detection methods such as ZF, MMSE, ZF-VBLAST and
the proposed PS-driven CE detection algorithm in Fig. 4.
It is found that the proposed algorithm provides a near-ML
performance in most range of interest and outperforms the
MMSE detector by more than 12 dB at BER= 10−4. In Figs.
5. and 6., we plot the BER performance of the PS-driven CE
detector using both xg(1) and xp(2) in a 4-QAM based 6× 6
MIMO system and a 8-QAM based 4 × 4 MIMO system,
respectively.
Next, let consider the situation when the channel estimate
is not perfect. Orthogonal training sequences can be generated
from a perfect root-of-unity sequence (PRUS) [13] which is
constructed from the Frank-Zadoff-Chu-sequence [14] as
s(k) =
{
ejπCk
2/N , for N is even
ejπCk(k+1)/N , for N is odd (28)
with k = 0, . . . , N−1 where N denotes the length of sequence
and C is a positive integer that is relatively prime to N . The
updating formula for the importance distributions is chosen to
be
f (k+1)(xi = a) = 0.1f
(k)
s (xi = a) + 0.1f
(k)
g(1)(xi = a)
+0.2f
(k)
p(2)(xi = a) + 0.6f
(k)(xi = a).
(29)
Fig. 7. shows the BER performance with σ2ΔH = 0.03 using
the original score function and the modified one.
