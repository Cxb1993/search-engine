2. Abstract 
Lithium ion battery is a major component for 
providing power in electronic equipment. 
Recently, the development of the high capacity 
anode material, many researchers focus on the 
metal (such as Sn, Sb). The carbon are taking the 
lead in anode for commercialization of Li Ion 
batteries, some researchers modified the 
tin-oxides on the carbon surface as anodes to 
accelerative Lithium intercalated/deintercalated 
and to avert the volume change of metal. The 
adequate amount of metal oxides on the carbon 
surface can improve the electrochemistry 
characteristics for battery application. The rules 
of metal oxides on the carbon surface for SEI 
films has been studied. We introduce the tin 
metal with oxygen or sulfur compounds into the 
SEI structure to help the XPS, FTIR surface 
analysis and materials analysis technique on the 
SEI films and to understand tin oxides and tin 
sulfurs how to affect Li+ intercalated/ 
deintercalated in surface. These modified 
materials are investigated by the cyclic 
voltammetry test, electrochemical impedance 
measurements, cycle life performance, coin cell 
tests to observe the electrochemical behaviors of 
tin oxides and tin sulfurs on the NG surface. The 
SEM, ESCA, Auger, and FTIR are applied to 
analysis the surface composition of SEI films. 
From the electrochemical behaviors and material 
surface analysis results, we have proved that the 
rules of tin oxides, and tin sulfurs on SEI 
structure.

anodes for Li-ion batteries by using the pyrolysis 
and electroless plating methods of Sn onto 
graphite powders. From the electrochemical 
behaviors and material surface analysis results, 
we have proved that the rules of tin oxides and 
tin sulfurs on SEI structure.  
4. EXPERIMENTAL 
4.1 Preparation of Sn graphite composite 
anodes 
The natural graphite powders (China Steel 
Chemical Co., Taiwan) used in this work had an 
average particle size of 19.89 μm and a 
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of 
5.0 m2g-1. The preparation methods of Sn-coated 
graphite materials were used by pyrolysis and 
electroless plating methods.  
The pyrolysis preparation of Sn-coated 
graphite material  began with dissolving SnCl4 
(SHOWA) into an isopropanol solution 
containing 30 vol% concentrated HCl in a 2.0 
mol dm-3 concentration. Next, sixty grams of 
graphite power were added into 285 ml of the 
above SnCl4 solution sample and then mixed 
over 24 hours. The mixture was heated to remove 
the solvent at 100oC in an oven under continuous 
stirring. After about 6 hours, the solvent was 
completely removed and the mixed materials had 
aggregated into a granular solid state. The 
aggregated materials were heated to perform the 
pyrolysis in a furnace at 450oC under Ar 
atmosphere for 2 hours, then the furnace was 
cooled to room temperature. The resulting 
SnO/Sn-graphite composite samples were finally 
hand-milled in a mortar and sieved at a pore size 
of 200 μm mesh.  
The electroless plating process was putted 
graphite powder into a solution rich in stannite 
ion and then causes the precipitation of Sn metal 
onto the graphite particles. Some researchers37, 38  
reported plating tin onto a copper substrate from 
a bath containing SnCl2-NaOH. In our modified 
version of their process, firstly, appropriate 
amounts of Sn(BF4)2 and HBF4 were dissolved in 
de-ionized water, then mixed with natural 
graphite (NG) powder and stirred at 60 oC to 
obtain a metal-precursor solution. Na2S2O4 and 
HBF4 solution was immediately added into the 
metal-precursor solution under strong stirring and 
then kept at 60 oC and aged for 30 min during 
which period Na2S2O4 reduction of the stannite 
ion to Sn metal occurred. The modified graphite 
powder was then separated from the 
metal-precursor solution by filter paper rinsed 
with alcohol two times and then rinsed repeatedly 
with de-ionized water until the pH value reached 
7. The modified graphite powder was then put 
into a conventional vacuum oven and dried at 
room temperature for 30 minutes. Next the 
temperature was raised over a period of 30 
minutes to 90 oC and then maintained at this 
temperature for 12 hours. The resulting 
Sn-graphite composite powder was finally sieved 
at 200 μm mesh.  
Electrodes were prepared by mixing Super S 
(1.53 wt%, MMM Carbon, Belgium), 
poly(vinylidene difluoride) powder (3.57 wt%, 
PVDF W1300, Kureha Chemical Industry, Japan) 
and Sn-graphite composite (94.9 wt%) in 
N-methylpyrolidinone (NMP, ISP) solvent. The 
mixed slurry was then coated onto copper foil 
(10 μm, Nippon Foil Co., Japan) and dried at 90
℃. The dried electrode was compressed to make 
a smooth and compact film structure by a roller 
at room temperature. The composite anode was 
stored in the glove box with oxygen and humidity 
content maintained below 5 ppm for more than 
24 hours before the electrochemical 
characterization.  
4.2 Electrochemical characterization 
Electrochemical performance of the 
Sn-graphite composite anodes was examined by 
using two-electrode test cells (coin-type cells) 
which consisted of a composite electrode, a 
microporous separator (Celgard 2300), a metallic 
lithium electrode and a electrolyte of 1 mol dm-3 
LiPF6 in a 50:50 w/w mixture of ethylene 
carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). 
Coin-type cells were assembled for testing in a 
glove box. Lithium sheet (FMC) of 0.02 mm 
thickness was cut into disk shapes for the use as 
the negative electrode. The assembled cells were 
tested for charge/discharge behavior at the 
constant current mode, cycling galvanostatically 
at 0.1 C (0.325 mA cm-2) over the range of 0.01 – 
2.0 V. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements 
were carried out with an Autolab electrochemical 
analyzer (Autolab PGSTAT30, Eco Chemie) with 
 5
spots proved the presence of tin, sulfur, and 
oxygen as Figure 2.  
The influence of SnO or SnSx on the 
electrochemical properties of Sn-graphite 
composite was studied by cyclic voltammetry 
(CV). The first and second cycles of the CV plots 
for the Sn-graphite composite electrodes in 1 mol 
dm-3 LiPF6 EC-DEC solution are shown in 
Figures 4(a) and (b), respectively. For the first 
reduction of the SnO-graphite composite 
electrode (Figure 4(a), curve II), three peaks are 
observed at 1.05, 0.75 and 0 V (vs. Li+/Li), 
respectively. However, the peak of 1.05 V has 
disappeared in the further cycling (Figure 4(b), 
curve II), this phenomenon is attributed to the 
irreversible reduction of tin oxide. The peaks 
between 1.2 and 0.9 V are correspond to the 
formation of lithium oxide and metallic tin.17 For 
the first reduction of the SnSx-graphite composite 
electrode (Figure 4(a), curve II), three peaks are 
observed at 1.70, 1.25 and 0 V (vs. Li+/Li), 
respectively. The peak of 1.70 V has almost 
disappeared in the further cycling (Fig. 4(b), 
curve III), this phenomenon is attributed to the 
irreversible reduction of sulfur and part of 
lithium sulfur oxidation at 1.9 V. 22 The peak of 
1.25 V has disappeared in the further cycling (Fig. 
4(b), curve III), this is due to the irreversible 
reduction of tin sulfur correspond to the 
formation of Li2S and metal tin. The broad peak 
starting at 0.90 V and centered around 0.75 V 
presumably corresponds to the formation of a 
passivation film17 and, simultaneously, to the 
insertion of lithium into tin with the formation of 
Li-Sn alloys17, 25. Lithium insertion/de-insertion 
in the graphite occurs in the potential range of 
0-0.2 V. An examination of curves II and III in 
Figures 4(a) and (b) reveals that the lithium 
insertion/de-insertion currents between 0 and 0.2 
V were slightly decreased by the modification of 
tin on graphite surface. This result implies that 
the Li-graphite insertion/deinsertion behavior 
may be influenced by the incorporation of tin 
oxide and tin sulfur on the graphite surface.  
Figure 5 shows the Li-insertion and 
Li-extraction curves of the graphite/Li and 
Sn-graphite/Li cells at 0.325 mA cm-2 (0.1 C)in 
the potential range of 0.01-2.0 V. The Li-insertion 
curve of SnO-graphite (Figure 5, curve (2)) can 
be divided into three parts: a shoulder at 0.9 V, a 
pseudo-plateau near 0.7 V, and a consecutive of 
plateaus for potentials lower than 0.2 V. The first 
shoulder of the Li-insertion curve at ca. 0.90 V 
shows the reduction of tin oxide by lithium with 
the subsequent formation of Li2O and metallic 
tin40. The formation of Li2O and metallic tin 
appears as an irreversible reaction that partially 
contributes to the irreversibility of this system. 
During the insertion of Li, Li-Sn alloys are 
successively formed in the potential range of 
0.9-0.2 V40, whereas the Li insertion to the 
interlayers of the graphite crystal lattice occurs 
mainly below 0.2 V. The Li-insertion curve of 
SnSx-graphite (Figure 5, curve (3)) can be 
divided into four parts: a shoulder at 1.7 V, a 
pseudo-plateau near 1.0 V, a pseudo-plateau near 
0.7 V, and a consecutive of plateaus for potentials 
lower than 0.2 V. The first shoulder of the 
Li-insertion curve at ca. 1.7 V shows the 
reduction of sulfur by lithium with the 
subsequent formation of Li2S41, 42. The formation 
of Li2S appears as an irreversible reaction of this 
system. The Li-insertion curve at ca. 1.0 V shows 
the reduction of Sn-sulfur by lithium with the 
subsequent formation of Li2S and Sn metal41, 42. 
The formation of Li2S and Sn metal partially 
contributes to the irreversibility of this system. 
During the insertion of Li, Li-Sn alloys are 
successively formed in the potential range of 
0.9-0.2 V40, whereas the Li insertion to the 
interlayer of the graphite crystal lattice occurs 
mainly below 0.2 V. In contrast, the Li-extraction 
process appears to result from a two-phase 
reaction. Lithium extraction in the graphite 
occurs in the potential range of 0.01-0.2 V. The 
decomposition reaction of lithium-tin alloys 
exists by a shoulder near 0.6 V (refer to Figure 5, 
Li extraction in curves (2) and (3)). Significantly, 
the alloy reactions and the intercalation reactions 
are reversible. The capacities and the coulombic 
efficiency at first cycle by 0.1 C charge/discharge 
are shown in Table 1. The coulombic efficiency 
at first cycle for the graphite, SnO-graphite and 
SnSx-graphite electrodes was 89.5%, 80.4% and 
78.7%, respectively. The values of Sn-garphite 
composites are lower than that of the pristine 
graphite material, suggesting that the Sn-oxide or 
Sn-sulfur reacts with Li+ 17, 40-42 and/or a solid 
electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer presents on the 
surface of the Sn particles during 
 7
ion etching duration. Fig. 9 (a)-(c) show the XPS 
spectra of O 1s regions for the surface of pristine 
graphite, SnO-graphite, and SnSx-graphite. The 
peak at 531.6-532 eV corresponding to 
Li2CO3/LiOH is observed50, 51, which decreases 
after 6.25 min of etching time. The peak at 532.6 
eV is corresponding to RCOOLi species51-53. The 
oxygen spectra are highly in line with this 
decription as both 531-533 eV (carbonate) O 
peaks. The carbon peak at 290 eV should be 
attributed to carbonate (-OCO2Li, or Li2CO3) 
while the 285-289 eV peak can be attributed to 
alkoxy, ethereal, and hydro-carbon species. The 
depth profiles of C, O, F, S, and Sn elements of 
pristine graphite, SnO-graphite, SnSx-graphite 
electrodes are shown in Fig. 10 (a), (b), (c), (d), 
and (e), respectively. The amount of C increased 
with increasing argon ion etching duration. The 
amount of the other elements decreased with 
increasing argon ion etching duration (except 
elements). Form these depth profiles, it can be 
seen that a surface film consisting of organic and 
inorganic compounds exists on the SnO- and 
SnSx-graphite electrodes reduced in LiPF6 
EC-DEC solution. The amount of O markedly 
decreased with increasing argon ion etching from 
0 to 0.45 min. The amount of O in the various 
electrodes increased in the following order: 
SnSx-graphite > pristine graphite > SnO-graphite. 
The thickness of these surface films were 
calculated about 22.5 nm vs argon ion etching 
standard sample SiO2 at 50 nm min-1. The 
amount of Sn decreased with increasing argon 
ion etching duration, suggesting the Sn atoms 
were excluded by SEI structure during formation. 
However, the amount of S increased with 
increasing etching time from 0 to 0.45 min, after 
0.45 min, the amount of S slightly decreased with 
increasing etching time. Fig. 10(d) shows the 
XPS spectra of S 2p for SnSx-graphite electrode. 
In the XPS spectra of S 2p, the peaks 
corresponding to Li2S and –Sn- were observed at 
161.5 and 163.4 eV, respectively. (Figure not 
show here) These results suggested that sulfur 
may be co-reaction with electrolyte and C on 
surface to from SEI films. The amount of F in the 
various electrodes before etching 4 min increased 
in the following order: pristine graphite > 
SnSx-graphite > SnO-graphite. However, the 
decreasing rate of amount of F at SnSx-graphite 
electrode was slower than that at other electrodes.  
We then compared the electrode surfaces by 
FTIR spectroscopy, using the diffuse reflectance 
mode. FTIR is a useful tool to probe the local 
composition of the surface layer since this 
technique is known to be highly suitable for 
non-destructive testing of thin surface layers54-56. 
Fig. 11 displays the FTIR patterns of (a) the 
graphite, (b) SnO-graphite, and SnSx-graphite 
after 2 cycles at 0.1 C and discharge to 0.8 V. In 
spite of the difficulties in obtaining high 
resolution spectra from the surface species, on 
the graphite electrodes, the spectra feature bands 
at 650, 700-800, 850-1050, and 2800-3000 cm-1 
indicative of an organic substance containing 
C=O, C-O, O-Li, and C-H bonds.54, 57, 58 The 
FTIR patterns of films on those electrodes 
indicate that the major compound of the films are 
lithium alkyl carbonate (ROCO2Li) and Li2CO3. 
Aurbach’s group 57 who shows that the formation 
of Li2CO3 and (CH2OCO2Li)2 occurs in EC/DEC 
1 mol dm-3 LiPF6 electrolyte attributing EC 
reduction products. For the spectrum of pristine 
graphite electrode, the ν C-O peaks in 1000-1050 
cm-1 range and ν C-H peaks in the 2800-3000 cm-1 
range appearing in part of the spectra different 
with SnO-graphite and SnSx-graphite electrodes 
that the surface films formed also contain alkoxy 
species (e.g. CH3OLi) and open-chain lithium 
alkyl carbonate (e.g. CH2(OCO2H)CH2OCO2Li) 
which can be attributed to the reaction of 
(CH2OCO2Li)2 with HF (LiPF6 electrolytes 
contaminated by impurities e.g. H2O etc) to from 
these surface species and to produce LiF57. These 
results also can be conformed by XPS data on F 
contents (as Fig. 10(c)). The FTIR results shows 
that the small amount of SnO or SnSx modified 
on graphite surface inhibits the reaction of 
(CH2OCO2Li)2 with HF, suggesting the small 
amount of SnO or SnSx modified on graphite 
surface can enhance SEI stability and cycling 
performance.  
To evaluate the effect of SnO- or SnSx- 
graphite on the thermal stability of the charged 
anodes, a DSC study was performed after 
charging the Sn-graphite composite anodes to 0.0 
V. The thermal stability of pristine graphite, SnO- 
and SnSx- graphite composite anodes are shown 
in Figure 12. The first exothermic reaction is the 
breakdown of SEI as judged from the previous 
 9
study has also presented a novel, fast and 
inexpensive stannite ion electroless plating 
methodology for creation of anodes for Li-ion 
batteries. The results showed a combination of Sn 
materials on the graphite, including Sn and SnSx, 
the Sx being primarily sulfur and secondarily 
oxygen. The sulfur comes from the Na2S2O4 in 
the starter solution, the oxygen from water 
solvent. The electrochemical properties of the 
SnO- and SnSx-graphite composite in Li-ion cells 
can be enhanced by the Sn, O and S elements 
incorporation. XPS results show that the 
thickness of SEI on surface of SnSx-graphite 
electrode is thicker than for the other graphite 
electrodes, and the F content in the SEI of 
SnSx-graphite electrode is uniform and lower. 
EIS results show that the resistance of Li transfer 
of SnSx-graphite electrode is lower than that of 
the other electrodes. SnO-and SnSx-modified on 
graphite surfaces change the structure and 
thickness of SEI during formation, which also 
influence Li insertion/extraction behaviors and 
reduce the thermal stability. The cyclic capacity 
performances of the SnO- or SnSx-graphite 
composite electrode are batter than that of the 
pristine graphite. DSC results show that the Sn 
deposits on the graphite surface would reduce the 
thermal stability of the anode.

2、與會心得 
 
本次會議的探討主題為電池相關技術及先進材料的資訊，不管是在學術研
究上的交流或者是商業上的技術的走向皆能兼顧，加上主辦單位在硬體上安排及
會議流程的進行皆很用心，令我受益良多。此次本人參加會議，收穫甚豐，參加
會議期間，本人聽了很多極具啟發性的演講，也從各國演講者中學習到不少研發
技巧與經驗，學習其獨特之專業知識，培養獨立研究與思考之能力，也對我個人
未來的研究方向有很大的幫助，獲益良多。由於參與大會的論文很多，分成多個
廳同時進行，包含鋰離子電池、燃料電池、NiH 電池、電容器、及 International 
Session on Science and Technology of Batteries, Fuel Cells and Capacitors 等等等相
關主題。值得一提的是，這一次會議中發表論文的不僅僅是學術單位而已，還有
一大部分是公司企業的研發單位，並且新能源與再生能源之電動車電池開發上此
次會議有日本之 NEDO 組織共襄盛舉，而且都相當精彩，這一點實值得臺灣學
習。報告人之主力研究對象為鋰離子電池的界面行為研發，界面電化學行為包括
電極材料特性及電解液特性，所以我對於陰極、陽極、及電解液三方面在日本之
研發情況均需有一定程度的瞭解，能作分領域規劃後再作心得分享是最佳的方
式。目前鋰離子電池的研究開發深受重視，主要是鋰離子電池將是未來油電混合
車與電動車輛之重要能源供應系統有關；再加上鋰離子電池對太陽能電池與再生
能源(e.g., 風力發電)之供電的儲存與穩定性提供極佳的效果，同時鋰離子電池
在車輛之應用層面已經迅速推展當中並獲得極佳的成效，因此研究對象一直從電
極材料、電解質導電性能、穩定性之測試搭配太陽能電池或風力發電等電力系統
之探討，內容包羅萬象，值得國人注意。 
本次與會心得在鋰離子電池陰極、陽極、及電解液三方面分享如下:
