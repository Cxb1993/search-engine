Abstract 
In today’s world, a leisure and recreational area is a popular place that provides not only 
relaxation and recreation but also beautiful surroundings, high quality food, even facilities to 
exercise and do other healthy activities. Different from other real estimates, it requires a large 
investment of resources to maintain the attractiveness for visitors. Inappropriate strategy as well as 
incorrect scheduling may cause the failure of any development project, and especially that of a 
leisure development projects. However, planners often subjectively overestimate the project or 
cater to the preferences of the investors, resulting in an over-developed or imbalanced 
development. This paper provides an integrated decision support model that helps the planner to 
search for near-optimal development strategy, including scheduling, level and layout. Integrating 
optimization algorithms and simulation, it employs a propose advice to be used in the planning 
stage. Because the complex and dynamic analysis is done by the system instead of by the planner, 
it speeds up the decision making process of the planning stage.

三、文獻探討 
Fig.1 shows the interactions between amenities and people. The products of real estate in a 
vacation residential development project can be offered in many different forms including 
timeshare, retirement homes, vacation homes, vacation rental units, and fractional ownership. We 
generally call buyers of these real estate products as primary or second home buyers. These people 
and the other two types of people, namely tourists and tenants, will spend their money to receive 
serving of amenities including attractions, food services, accommodation, and commodity sales. 
The business performance of these amenities will stimulate the primary or second home buyers to 
purchase real estates and tenants to lease them, resulting in a boost of the values of the project and 
the lands. Thus, the business performance and real estate revenue of a vacation residential 
development project are closely correlated. In addition, the infrastructure of a development project 
cannot bring in direct revenue but is vital to the operation of the entire project.  
 
Fig. 1. The interactions between amenities and people  
To sum up, the schedule and level of a vacation residential development project should be 
properly planned so as to maintain a balance between investment into and revenue from amenities. 
Thus, in the planning of a vacation residential development project, allocation of limited resources 
is particularly important. With an objective of generating the optimal revenue from amenities, the 
planner needs to consider the cycle of “development – operation – investment of revenue from 
operation into development” in the scheduling of the project, so as to achieve revenue optimization.

resources, the start and finish dates of activities are decided as a simultaneous sequence. This makes 
it difficult to represent and solve an optimal development levels and schedule in terms of functions 
and mathematical operations. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue through simulation.   
Simulation has been applied in many studies of project planning, such as the investment 
projects evaluation [Nowak 2005 LCEM] and ranking major transport projects [Su 2006 LCEM]. 
The effectiveness of simulation in these studies is satisfactory. We model the dynamic development 
and operation processes of the amenities using the simulation network technology. Each amenity 
involved in the development of a vacation residential project must be planned and designed, 
constructed, and operated. In the project schedule, each stage is viewed as an individual activity that 
includes duration, cost, and revenue. The cost and revenue of an activity are viewed as the input and 
output of capital resource.  
The main elements of the simulation network are Queue and Combi. Queues hold the 
resources that are idle. Each Queue is associated with a particular resource type and provides a 
position that allows units to be delayed pending Combi activities. Combis represent tasks that start 
when certain conditions are met. Fig.3 shows an example of the relationship between amenity’s 
activity and resource in simulation network. The arrow starting from Cash to Operate_GolfCourse 
denotes that Cash is a condition of launch of Operate_GolfCourse. Resources will flow from Cash 
to Operate_GolfCourse after Operate_GolfCourse is launched. In other words, the resources 
flowing to Operate_GolfCourse are the costs of operating the golf course. The arrow from 
Operate_GolfCourse to Cash denotes that Cash is the output resource generated by 
Operate_GolfCourse. In other words, after Operate_GolfCourse is activated, Cash will be 
generated, which is the revenue from operating the golf course. FoodService_Demand is another 
resource generated during execution of Operate_GolfCourse. There are also arrows connecting the 
consumption requirements of the food service to other activities (such as Operate_Restaurant). The 
whole project’s network is composed of many Combis and Queues, and the arrow links between 
them denote the flows of input or output of resources.

and moves to amenity level or amenity activity j, the selection probability used in the original ant 
algorithm [Dorigo et al. 1996] is as per Eq. (1):

where kallowed  is the list of amenities’ levels or amenities’ activities not yet selected; τij is 
the pheromone trail; ηij, which is the heuristic value representing the desirability of selecting 
amenity level or amenity activity j, is the increase in NPV caused by establishing j; α and β are the 
parameters that determine the relative influence of the pheromone trail and the heuristic value.  
When ants select or leave an amenity level or amenity activity, they will deposit pheromones 
as a reference for the ants that follow them. This is called pheromone updating. There are two kinds 
of pheromone updates. One is the local pheromone update that all ants will perform, and the other is 
the offline pheromone update that only the best ant will perform [Dorigo et al. 1996].  
4.4. Case study 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we selected DaPeng Bay project as an 
example. DaPeng Bay, located in the south of Taiwan, is a holistic bay area development project. 
The goals of this project are to build a place containing rich resources for marine and forest 
recreation and allowing people to live a leisure life. The project’s NPV is estimated over a 20-year 
period. As shown in Fig. 4, a total of 15 amenities will be developed. Among these amenities, 
vacation home and marina will be built on both the east and the west region of the project area. 
How to determine the development level and schedule of these 15 amenities is important and 
difficult for the project planner. The investment is huge and spanning a long period of time, so the 
entire project should be optimized to ensure financial balance and successful implementation of the 
project.

between activities. The resource inputs and resource outputs of these activities are shown in Table 
1. Consumption of the capacity of parking lot and the capacity of road and environment facility is 
inevitable in the construction and operation stages. Besides, during the operation of the hotel and 
villa, there will be consumption requirements of food court, SPA and fitness center, and 
entertainment center, and the visiting requirements of exhibition center and sports center.   
Table 1

R2: 1.1 x M6Level (visits / day) 
R3: 2.1 x M6Level (visits / shop-day) 
R4: 3 x M6Level (visits / day) 
R5: 1.6 x M6Level (visits / day) 
R6: 2.5 x M6Level (visits / day) 
Note: 
R1: capital (US$69,562,500 at the start)   R2: visiting requirement of exhibition center 
R3: consumption requirement of food court   R4: visiting requirement of sports center 
R5: consumption requirement of SPA and fitness center R6: consumption requirement of entertainment center 
R7: capacity of parking lot     R8: capacity of road and environment facility 
 
For real estates that are available for sale after construction, the estimated capital output can 
also be reflected in the simulation network. Considering the local residential market situation, the 
sales plan for vacation homes and timeshares is to sell 20% of them during construction and 40%, 
20%, and 20% in the years after the operation begins. The annual sales capital output will be evenly 
distributed to the 12 month for subsequent estimation.   
Through the above simulation network, we can understand the interactions involved in each 
amenity and resource flows in the project. The ACO parameters, φ, α and β, significantly impact 
upon the search for a global optimal solution and the convergence speed. In this case study, we 
referred to related studies [Lee 2009 AUTCON] and adopted φ =0.9, α =0.5, and β =0.5 in our 
optimization process. Based on the dynamic simulations and ant colony optimizations of the model 
(Fig.2), a near-optimal solution of development level and schedule is proposed.

Therefore, in this paper, we attempted to find a model that can assist project planners in 
development decisions to enhance the success rate of vacation residential development projects.   
We proposed a model based on the integration of simulation and ant colony optimization. The 
model can search the near-optimal amenity levels and development schedule as an advice for the 
project planner. The performance of the proposed model was also evaluated using a case. Because 
the complex calculations are done by the system instead of by the planner, and the planning advice 
is provided by the model, the decision making process have been made substantially easier.
