須額外使用緩震電路(Snubber)，以降低漏感與寄生電容振盪造成之電壓突波(Voltage 
Spike)，緩震電路的使用亦伴隨著功率損耗，再者一般之返馳式轉換器在未使用特殊控
制或輔助開關的情況下，並無法達成軟切換(Soft Switching)之目的，因此功率晶體的硬
切換(Hard Switching)方式同樣也伴隨著功率損耗。軟性切換可減少開關元件之切換損失
及降低電磁干擾，同時使得開關零件的電壓或電流應力變小，進而改善其導通損失及降
低成本，因而近年來軟性切換的電路架構已廣泛地被使用。為此，互補型驅動轉換器於
近年來普遍地被應用，包括主動式箝位(Active-Clamp)架構、推挽式(Push-Pull)架構、半
橋(Half-Bridge)架構、全橋(Full-Bridge)式等架構。這些轉換器主要的優點是容易達成零
電壓切換之特性，且開關元件應力較小或電流應力較小。 
另外，當系統待機(Standby Mode)時，由於有三組轉換器電路，因此待機功率損耗
較高。待機損耗即綠色功率(Green Power)，一般大多訂定在0.5~1 W之下，此乃避免電
氣產品在不開機操作時仍消耗了系統本身的功率。面對此一規範之要求，相關電子產品
製造廠均針對未來可能的系統規範及要求開發出適當之產品(如低耗電之IC)及電源供應
器，從2001年7月起美國之政府機構將不得購買待機損耗超過1 W的電器產品。由此可
見，在不久的未來電源轉換器低待機損耗將成為基本要求。返馳式轉換器除其本身在正
常負載條件所使用之控制器(功能)外，為了符合在輕載或空載之條件下之綠色電源規
範，必須額外使用突發模式(Burst Mode)作為待機模式下之控制方式。

傳統LCD螢幕電源供應器的AC/DC/DC架構與控制方塊圖如圖2所示，而負載在輕

控制功率晶體之導通及開關，如圖3所示。一般而言，在輕載或空載的條件下，以最大
的工作週期操作，僅需幾個週期就可使直流輸出電壓維持在某一範圍內(即輸出電壓上
限值與下限值之間)，當輸出電壓高於上限值時系統可關閉功率晶體之控制訊號，直至
直流輸出電壓低於下限值，系統則重新輸出對功率晶體之控制訊號，如此能減少在輕載
及空載條件下，週期時間內功率晶體之切換次數及系統之切換損失，Flyback待機模式之
損耗約為0.8 ~ 1 W左右。

圖5、高輸入直流電壓之橋式變流器串接架構 
 
國內外對於平面顯示器螢幕之電源供應器研究，無論是在學術界或是工業界都是方
興未艾。以國內的相關研發情形而言，除了生產電力電子產品的各業界單位以外，學界
方面的研究成果有台灣大學陳秋麟教授與中正大學吳財福教授在電漿顯示面板驅動系
統的改善，成功大學陳建富教授與梁從主教授在LCD TV電源供應器的研製，以及台灣
科技大學謝冠群教授對於LCD TV驅動電源控制器的IC化等，但對於降低無載損耗與高
壓輸入之變流器相關研究則較少見。國外對於相關領域的研究，大多著重於DC/DC轉換
器與DC/AC變流器的效率提升，少有討論多級轉換器串接時Burst Mode的控制策略。本
計畫預計以兩年時間繼續深入研究高性能之LCD螢幕電源供應器系統，預期本計畫之研
究成果，將包含實現高轉換效率與低無載損耗功率之電路架構，並推導其小信號等效電
路與分析動態響應，以輔助回授系統之設計，更期盼這些研發成果能提供相關產業應
用，而對於國內高科技發展略有助益。 
 
三、研究方法 
第一年 
本計畫預定以一年時間完成高性能AC/DC與DC/DC兩級轉換器研發，規格為200 
W/12 V，前級採用不連續模式控制之Boost功率因數修正器，以降低控制器設計難度與
電路成本，並使輸入電流諧波符合安規，同時輸出380 V至400 V之高直流電壓。後級
DC/DC轉換器則採串聯或串並聯共振之半橋轉換器，利用零電壓軟切換與變頻技術，實
現全載範圍整機平均效率達87 %以上，以及空載損耗低於500 mW的直流電源供應器。
首先透過運用電路模擬方式以及探討電路動作原理，確實尋求全載範圍均可零電壓切換
的操作條件，並以實際電路驗證電路性能。本計畫將捨棄傳統採用Flyback轉換器以及固
定切換頻率調整責任週期的方式，提出共振半橋轉換器之新型回授調頻控制策略及其控
制電路，並實現上述兩級轉換器之改良型Burst Mode控制策略，同時研究該電路之小訊
號模型。計畫的執行與研究步驟詳述如下。 
本計畫第一年將運用市售IC實現不連續電流模式之昇壓型功率因數修正器，其電路
架構如同一般DC/DC Boost轉換器，如圖6所示。除了一般PFC的設計重點之外，另須考
慮不連續電流模式的輸入電流諧波較大，因此可以在電源側並接交流電容濾除高頻切換
電流。輸出直流準位約在380 V至400 V之間，此為因應輸入交流電源的廣大變化範圍
(Universal Input)，但為提高整機效率，亦可考慮在110 V交流輸入時穩壓於較低準位。 
本計畫第一年將由RLC串聯共振電路開始，如圖7所示，深入探討串聯或串並聯共
振半橋轉換器的操作原理，以便設計變頻切換之穩壓策略，以及各諧振元件與變壓器的
值與規格制定。圖8為RLC串聯共振電路之負載電壓vR對輸入電壓vin的頻率響應圖，一
般均將操作頻率設定在共振頻率之上，以使共振電路呈現電感性特性。由圖八可知，在

圖9、串聯共振半橋轉換器 
 
本計畫將串聯共振半橋轉換器的動作順序分為四個階段分析之，分別為第一能量傳
遞區間、第一能量共振區間、第二能量傳遞區間與第二能量共振區間，如圖10所示。

圖十13、串並聯共振半橋轉換器負載電壓對輸入電壓轉移函數之頻率響應圖 
 
如圖14所示為串聯或串並聯共振半橋轉換器搭配Burst Mode的動作時序，當
負載電流漸漸變小時，誠如先前所敘述之其系統電壓增益會慢慢變大，因而造成輸出電
壓也相對地變大，當輸出電壓觸碰Burst Mode控制器所設定之寬度上限值時，Burst 
Mode控制器便會產生一觸發訊號給DC/DC轉換器的控制器，使之停止動作。又當
輸出電壓觸碰Burst Mode控制器所設定之寬度下限值時，便會產生一啟動訊息給
DC/DC轉換器的控制器，使之開始動作。因此可知，Burst Mode突發群的寬度將隨
著負載電流變小而變窄，甚至連出現的時間間隔也慢慢在拉長，因而降低空載損耗。

值之上，輸出電壓便會慢慢下降，當輸出電壓觸碰到第二下限值時，Burst Mode控制器
便會適當地啟動功率因數修正器，將輸出電壓提高至第一下限值之上，而利用此一方式
來達成輸出穩壓且更加降低空載損耗的效果。

圖17、圖16電路之等效電路 
 
雖然在文獻中可以查得相關控制策略，但由於本計畫的架構為兩級串接形式，因此
對於後級的變流器而言，其輸入電壓並非一完美直流波形，而是一具有較大120 Hz漣波
的直流電壓。本計畫除了達成軟切換以提高轉換效率之外，並設計回授控制電路以降低
諧波電壓。 
結合壓電變壓器驅動冷陰極管之半橋諧振換流器電路架構如圖18所示，其中包含換
流器之直流輸入電源VDC、濾波電感Ls、壓電變壓器PZT及兩組功率開關S1與S2。當功率
開關切換頻率接近壓電變壓器之機械諧振頻率(Mechanical Resonant Frequency)時，即可
形成一選擇性(Selectivity)極佳之帶通濾波器(Band-Pass Filter)，可濾除輸入信號之電流諧
波及直流成份，進而產生弦波形式之電壓與電流起動及驅動冷陰極管。

本計畫第二年所提之高輸入直流電壓軟切換橋式變流器，其負載為多支燈管，而
LCD螢幕亮度的均勻程度即與燈管電流的均流相關，一般要求在5 % ~ 10 %之間，但對
於大尺寸面板的均流效果將更加嚴格。傳統使用的方式是利用被動式均流電路(例如具
互耦效果之磁性元件、或是高阻抗元件作為阻抗匹配)，因此需要較多數量之磁性材料。
本計畫將試圖利用主動式均流電路，達成低成本、均流誤差在5 %以內之目標。 
如圖21所示，即為本文採用多組冷陰極燈管之背光模組架構。其中，市電電源經由
交流-直流轉換器(AD-DC Converter)與功率因數控制器(PFC Controller)將其輸入電壓與

直流電壓(380 VDC)，驅動後級D型並聯諧振換流器(Class-D Parallel Resonant Inverter)，
達成啟動與控制多組冷陰極燈管(Multi-CCFL)之目的。其次，換流器將功率因數修正器
之輸出電壓利用換流器電路中之功率開關切換為脈波型式之電力信號後，其信號經由諧

藉此啟動與驅動多組冷陰極燈管。再者，藉由取樣其電流當作回授(Feedback)信號控制
換流器其脈波形式電力信號之切換頻率，藉此達成D型並聯諧振換流器輸出功率穩定之

提昇產品之競爭力。

圖21、本文採用之多組冷陰極燈管之背光模組架構 
 
如圖22所示為目前普遍應用於驅動多組冷陰極燈管之架構，其各組冷陰極燈管皆由
個別之諧振換流器所驅動。由於此架構驅動各組燈管之控制信號為非同步之狀態，因
此，欲調整燈管之亮度時，必須外加電路使其控制信號完成同步之狀態，故需額外增加
電路之製作成本。其次，此電路換流器所需之低電壓輸入電源Vin仍須經由一DC-DC降
壓轉換器而獲得，因此，其電路之整體效率無法提昇。再者，其多組驅動冷陰極燈管之
電路也將大幅增加液晶顯示器之構件體積。

Analysis and Design of a Double-Output
Series-Resonant DC–DC Converter
Yu-Kang Lo, Member, IEEE, Shang-Chin Yen, and Tzu-Herng Song
Abstract—This paper presents a method for designing the ratio
of the feedback weighting gains and the transformer secondary
turns ratio of a double-output series-resonant dc–dc converter.
The equivalent circuit models of the secondaries including the
circuit parasitics are examined. The feedback line and load lines
are drawn on a rectangular-coordinated output-voltage plane to
check if the output specifications can be met. Three load ranges are
classified. Then the ratio of the weighted feedback gains and the
turns ratio of the transformer secondaries are determined. Design
procedures are addressed. Satisfactory results on a double-output
180-W prototype are demonstrated and verified.
Index Terms—Cross-regulation, double-output series-resonant
converter (SRC), secondary turns ratio, weighted feedback gains.
I. INTRODUCTION
HIGH-EFFICIENCY multiple-output dc–dc converters arewidely used nowadays. For instance, the 80 PLUS pro-
gram proposed by the Ecos Consulting encourages the manu-
facturers and the consumers of the PC products to participate to-
gether in pursuing advanced power supplies. Another example is
the backlight module driver for the ever-increasing liquid crystal
display (LCD) panels. There are many schemes to reduce the
power losses of the switching converters while operating ac-
tively. Among these, load resonant type is popular for the lack
of the output choke, which is noticeably attractive for multiple
outputs [1]–[15]. However, due to the effects of the cross regu-
lation, the output voltage specifications may not be satisfied for
the full load range [16]–[20].
In this paper, a half-bridge (HB) dc–dc series-resonant con-
verter (SRC) with double outputs is designed and implemented.
Equivalent circuit models including the parasitics for the secon-
daries are applied to check if the output voltage specifications
can be met at any load condition. Then the parameters of the
feedback controllers and the ratio of the weighting factors
for the two sensed output voltages are calculated. Also the
turns ratio of the transformer secondaries is determined. In
Sections II–V, governing formulas will be derived to facilitate
the design processes. Experiments on a 180-W prototype
are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical
analysis.

oscillator (VCO) produces an output frequency which is pro-
portional to the control voltage. The voltage gain of the SRC
can be adjusted, and thus the output voltages are regulated, by
tuning the oscillating frequency of the VCO. However, the ratio
between and determines the tightness of the voltage reg-
ulation under different load levels. The weighted feedback gains
of the two output voltages must be carefully designed to satisfy
the output specifications.

Thus , and then , can be determined
(14)
To demonstrate the effects of , , (or ) and on
the output voltage specifications, Fig. 6 depicts a more clar-
ified scenery near the nominal values of and . The
extremes of the output voltage specifications form a rectangle
with four vertices , , and . is a straight line passing
through . The best case is that also
passes through and . However, due to parameter variations,
the intersections of and the rectangle may not be exactly at
and . In that case, the specified output voltage limits may
be too conservative. If the intersection is between and , then
the actual minimum value of the first output voltage would be
higher than . Similarly, if the intersection of and the
rectangle is on rather than at , then the specification for
the lower bound of the second output voltage is too relaxed. An
intersection between and means that the specification for
the maximum value of the second output voltage can be more
stringent. And an intersection between and represents a
too loose specification for . Taking Fig. 6 for example,
intersects the rectangle at and . Thus the specifications
for and are too relaxed. The possible extreme
values for the two output voltages are then represented by the
rectangle .
IV. DESIGN ISSUES OF THE TRANSFORMER
SECONDARY TURNS RATIO
Fig. 5 describes the – relationship constrained only
by the feedback network. Another important factor affecting
the output voltage levels is the cross-regulation. The effects of
the cross-regulation represent the interactions between the two
outputs. Referring to Fig. 4 and assuming that and are
constants, the following relation can be determined. Define the

It is noted from (18) that is a function of . The
– relationship defined by (16) is also a straight
line. Adding this line, , on Fig. 5 results in the com-
plete – characteristics of the discussed double-output
SRC, as shown in Fig. 7. passes through one point
, which varies with the
load currents. The slope of is , which is the turns ratio of
the two secondary windings. The rectangle EFGH represents
all the possible points through which passes corresponding
to the specified load current ranges. The intersection of and
is the output voltage levels at certain load current levels. For
example, in Fig. 7 passes through , which corresponds to
the load combinations of and . Then the slope
of is tuned such that the intersection of and can be
between and . In that case the output voltage specifications
are not violated.
In the following descriptions, is denoted the line passing
through and , whose slope is . Similarly, is the
line passing through and , whose slope is . These
two slopes are calculated from the output specifications as
(19)
(20)
From Fig. 7, since rectangles and are respec-
tively in the first and third quadrants, is the load line that
meet the output voltage specifications and at
the load levels and with the largest slope. Sim-
ilarly, is the load line that meet the output voltage spec-
ifications and at the load levels and
with the smallest slope. There are three cases, described

C. Infeasible Load Ranges
As shown in Fig. 12, the relationship between and
is
(40)
In this case, a portion of the load ranges near or is infea-
sible. In other words, there are violations for the output voltage
specifications near or . To make the most use of the load
ranges, the secondary turns ratio is designed as
(41)
When is chosen to be , as depicted in Fig. 13(a),
is equal to . However, intersects the feedback line
at , outside and . It means that the output voltage spec-
ifications are violated between and . That is, goes be-
yond its maximum and exceeds its minimum near
and .
When is chosen to be , as depicted in Fig. 13(b),
is equal to . intersects the feedback line at ,
which is outside and . Thus, goes lower than its min-
imum and exceeds its maximum near and , .
The third option for the secondary turns ratio is that
, as shown in Fig. 13(c). and are intersections
of AC and and , respectively. It can be noted that the two
load lines and enclose and in the quadrangle
JIGE. The two output voltages will go beyond their extremes for
the load current levels near and .
From the analysis above, some comments about the design of
the transformer secondary turns ratio can be listed as follows.
1) For , the output voltage specifi-
cations can be met for all load levels if the sec-
ondary turns ratio satisfies the relationship
. It is suggested that is designed as
to allow for suitable load margins at the output
voltage extremes.
2) For , the only choice for the secondary
turns ratio is . The output voltage
specifications can be met for all load levels. However, there
is no load margin at the output voltage extremes.
3) For , the output voltage specifications
are violated at the extreme load levels. The secondary turns
ratio must satisfy the relationship
to make the most use of the load ranges, and to confine the
output voltage deviations.

pensate the infeasible part of the load ranges is to add dummy
loads for both outputs. The determination for the levels of two
dummy loads is a complicated process and requires time-con-
suming analytical manipulations, which is beyond the scope of
this paper.
VI. CONCLUSION
The circuit model of a double-output SRC is reviewed to
analyze the cross-regulation effects between the two outputs.
According to the output voltage specifications, a feedback line
can be drawn on the rectangular – plane. The optimum
ratio of the weighted feedback gains for a P-control error am-
plifier can then be determined. Once the reference voltage and
the lower resistor of the voltage-sensing divider are set, the two
upper resistors of the voltage divider can be designed. Based
on the specified load levels, a load line can also be formed on
the same – plane. And the slope of the load line is the
turns ratio of the transformer secondaries. It can be seen clearly

I .and (b) I and I (Time: 4 s/div).
from the – plane that the cross-regulation effects are the
severest at the extreme load combinations when one output is
at its lightest load and the other at its heaviest load. From the
slopes of the two extreme load lines, three distinct load ranges
are defined. For the feasible load ranges, the slope of the lower
extreme load line is smaller than that of the upper extreme load
line. In this case, an optimum secondary turns ratio is decided
to allow the maximum load margins.
Experimental results on a 180-W prototype prove the theoret-
ical analysis. The circuit parasitics, such as the leakage induc-
tance and the dc resistance of the transformer winding, affects
the accuracy of the proposed design method. It is also noted
that the easiest way to extend the feasible load ranges for a
double-output SRC is adding dummy loads. The presented anal-
ysis and design method on a double-output SRC is also appli-
cable to other multiple-output converters.

Feedback Design of a Piezoelectric
Transformer-Based Half-Bridge
Resonant CCFL Inverter
Yu-Kang Lo, Member, IEEE, and Kai-Jun Pai
Abstract—The feedback loop design of a half-bridge resonant
inverter based on a piezoelectric transformer (PT) for driving a
cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) is presented in this paper.
In order to stabilize the CCFL driving current and luminance,
the PT-based resonant inverter incorporating a feedback compen-
sator is designed to track the operating frequency. The dynamic
equations and the small-signal model of the presented inverter
system are established by using the harmonic approximation
and harmonic balance procedures. The feedback compensation is
performed by applying the derived small-signal block diagram.
The complete mathematical analysis and design considerations
are presented in detail. The experimental results agree with the
theoretical predictions and confirm the validity of the proposed
design approach.
Index Terms—Cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) inverter,

balance, piezoelectric transformer (PT).
I. INTRODUCTION
R ECENTLY, due to the prevalence of digital consumerelectronic products, the number of flat display panels
(FDPs) has also been proliferating. Among the various FDPs,
liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are the most popular for their
handy availability and cost-effective performance. Nowadays,
LCD panels can be found in a wide array of applications such
as in monitors, notebooks, and televisions [1]–[5]. Cold cathode
fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) are usually adopted for the back-
light sources of the LCD panels. A high-frequency inverter is
used to drive the CCFL, which thus determines the visualization
performance of the LCD panels. Conventionally, electromag-
netic transformers are utilized to provide the electrical isolation
and to step up the CCFL driving voltage. However, applications
of traditional electromagnetic transforms can be obstructed due
to core losses, lower conversion efficiencies, and the difficulty
to be manufactured into planiform in high-standard demands.
On the other hand, a piezoelectric transformer (PT) features
the flat configuration, low power loss, and immunity from the
electromagnetic interference. Thus, PTs are used to replace
the electromagnetic transformers in some rigid design cases,

where the space left for the CCFL inverters is limited [6]–[8].
The principle of a PT is based on the conversion between the
mechanical and electrical energies. There are several vibration
modes of a PT, such as thickness extensional vibration mode,
width-shear vibration mode, and longitudinal vibration mode
[9]. The longitudinal vibration mode with multilayer ceramic
material possesses a high voltage step-up ratio, which is partic-
ularly suitable for driving a CCFL [10].
One well-known approach for stabilizing the lamp current is
to compare the sensed lamp current to a current reference by an
error amplifier (EA). Then, a control voltage can be produced
to modulate the output frequency of a voltage-controlled os-
cillator (VCO). However, the bandwidth of a PT is so narrow
that the range of the output values of the feedback loop is
limited. Therefore, the VCO’s output frequency range must be
carefully designed. Otherwise, the CCFL driving current may
be fluctuated around the rated value, and the lamp luminance
flicker results. The selections of the feedback components are
thus crucial for a successful design. Although the half-bridge
(HB) resonant inverter incorporating a PT for driving a CCFL
backlight module has been presented for several years, the
small-signal analysis and compensator design are not clarified.
In this paper, the dynamic behaviors of a PT–CCFL combina-
tion are examined and the feedback elements are determined.
The operating frequency of the VCO is adjusted accordingly.
Therefore, the CCFL driving current and lamp power can be
maintained even under large parameter variations. The design
considerations and the experimental results are also given to
confirm the validities of the theoretical analysis and the derived
small-signal model.
II. SMALL-SIGNAL ANALYSIS
The variable-frequency resonant inverter for driving the
CCFLs has been proposed to improve the system performance
such as dimming control and feedback design [11], [12]. Al-
though the feedback compensating scheme has been adopted
in many literatures [13]–[16], the small-signal analysis is not
presented in detail. In this paper, the harmonic approximation
and harmonic balance procedures are applied to derive the dy-
namic equations and small-signal model of a PT-based resonant
inverter for designing the feedback compensator.
Fig. 1 shows the circuit configuration of the PT-based HB
resonant inverter for driving a CCFL, including the dc input
voltage VDC, power switches S1 and S2, the filter inductance
Ls, a PT, and a CCFL. Since the PT inherently possesses the

According to Fig. 2(d), Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws
are used to define the state variables and dynamic equations as

C. Harmonic Approximation Method
The high-order harmonics produced by the resonant inverter
can be filtered out by the PT. Therefore, the harmonic approxi-
mation equations for the voltage source and the state variables
can be derived [17], [18] as follows:
vs =V cs cosωst+ V

iLs = I

iL = IcL cosωst+ I

vCx =V
c
Cx

In these equations, the variables with the superscript c repre-
sent the amplitudes of the cosine term, whereas the variables
with the superscript s are the amplitudes of the sine terms.
Table II lists the amplitudes of the state variables in terms of the
parameters that appeared in Table I. It should be noticed from
Table I that all these amplitudes are functions of the excitation
amplitude Vs.
D. Harmonic Balance Procedures
Since the small-signal modulation frequency is much lower
than the switching frequency of the resonant inverter, the har-
monic balance procedures can be used [19]. First, (17)–(20) are
differentiated as follows [17], [18], [20]:

Substituting (12)–(15) in (21)–(24), the large-signal dynamic

The transfer function of the incremental lamp current versus
the switching frequency perturbation is derived for the feed-
back design of the PT-based resonant inverter. Introducing the
small perturbations (represented by the variables with a cap) to
(25)–(32), the dynamic equations of the linearized model can
be obtained by Taylor expansion [19] as follows:

PRACTICAL CIRCUIT PARAMETERS IN Fig. 2(a)

COEFFICIENTS IN (51)
Substituting (42), (43), and (49) in (50), Ginv(s) can be
expressed as
Ginv(s) =
k × b(s)
a(s)
(51)
where k is a constant, and a(s) and b(s) are, respectively,
eighth-order and seventh-order polynomials of s. An im-
pedance analyzer (HP-4194A) is employed to measure the
parameters of the tested PT (EFTU14R0M01A), including
Cd2, R, L, C, and Cd1. By substituting the practical circuit
parameters, as listed in Table III, in (50), all the coefficients
in (51) with descending powers can be calculated by Matlab
and are given in Table IV. Although some of these coefficients
seem enormous due to divergent values of the circuit elements,
(51) can be approximately reduced to a second-order transfer
function provided that the dominant poles are below several
tens of kiloradians per second. Therefore, only k, b0, a2, a1, and
a0 matter near the system bandwidth. It is also worth noting that
tolerances of the parameters listed in Table III will result in the
variations of the coefficients in (51). Nevertheless, the effects
on the low-frequency gain and corner frequency are negligible.
Grms(s) can be obtained from Fig. 3(a). It is assumed that
Dm is an ideal diode. Rm is 620 Ω and Cm is 0.1 µF. Thus,

The transfer characteristic of the adopted VCO in the experi-
ments is shown in Fig. 4. It is evident that the output frequency
ωs of VCO is proportional to the input voltage ve. Hence, the
transfer function of the VCO can be expressed as
ωs = 3.14× 104 × ve + 2.37× 105. (53)
Fig. 4. Transfer characteristic of the adopted VCO.
Fig. 5. Simulated and measured frequency responses of Go.
Substituting the small perturbations ωˆs and vˆe in (53) yields
the following small-signal transfer function of VCO:
Gvco(s) =
ωˆs
vˆe
= 3.14× 104. (54)
Therefore, the small-signal open-loop gain Go shown in
Fig. 3(b) is obtained as
Go(s) =
vˆf
vˆe
= Ginv(s)×Grms(s)×Gvco(s). (55)
By substituting (51), (52), and (54) in (55), Fig. 5 shows that
the simulated frequency responses are close to the measured
data. In Fig. 5, the simulated low-frequency gain is −3.34 dB
and the bandwidth is 5.4 kHz. The measured low-frequency
gain is −5 dB, and the bandwidth is 4.7 kHz (using FRA 5096,
NF Inc.). It is proven that the harmonic approximation and
harmonic balance procedures are both applicable to establish
the small-signal model of the PT-based CCFL inverter.
B. Feedback Design
From the simulation results shown in Fig. 5, the low-
frequency gain of Go is lower than 0 dB. A proportional-
integration (PI) compensator is used to boost the dc gain
to eliminate the steady-state error. In addition, the system
crossover frequency is properly placed to gain enough phase

compensation.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The circuit parameters and specifications of the tested PT-
based CCFL inverter are listed in Table V. Fig. 8(a) and (b)
illustrates the waveforms of the resonant inverter operated at
different input voltages without feedback. The VCO’s output
frequency fs is fixed at 54.2 kHz. When VDC = 15 V, as
shown in Fig. 8(a), v is 710 Vrms and i is 5.5 mArms. When
VDC = 20 V, as shown in Fig. 8(b), it is recorded that v drops
to 636 Vrms and i increases to 7.07 mArms. Fig. 9(a) and (b)
records the waveforms of the resonant inverter at different input
voltages with feedback compensation. The operating frequency
can be accurately tracked by the EA when the dc input voltage
is changed. The VCO’s output frequency changes from 54.2 to
55.5 kHz, whereas the CCFL driving voltage and current are
maintained at 710 Vrms and 5.5 mArms, respectively. Fig. 9(c)
shows that the operating frequency can be tracked during a
step change of VDC to stabilize and regulate the CCFL driving
voltage and current. Fig. 10 depicts the experimental results
of the lamp power P under varying input dc voltages. With
feedback compensation, the lamp power can be maintained at
about 3.9 W. On the other hand, the lamp power will increase
over 4.5 W as VDC rises without the feedback mechanism. From
these measurements, it is confirmed that the derived small-
signal model and the feedback design scheme can be used
to effectively track the operating frequency of the PT-based
resonant CCFL inverter. In addition, the lamp current, lamp
luminance, and lamp power can be stably regulated.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper presents a detailed derivation of the small-signal
model for the PT-based resonant CCFL inverter. In addition,
the feedback compensation is designed to stabilize the CCFL
driving current and lamp power at varying input dc voltages.
The contributions of the presented scheme are summarized as
follows. First, a low-profile backlight module can be imple-
mented by replacing the electromagnetic transformer with a
PT. Second, the harmonic approximation and harmonic balance
procedures are both applied to establish the small-signal model.
The experimental results closely agree with the theoretical
analysis. Moreover, the feedback compensator can be designed
according to the derived small-signal model to provide a dc

From the aforementioned discussions, it is noted that io jumps
from D · Is to Is at the start of State 1 and from −B · Is to −Is
at the start of State 4. The step changes of io are then (1−D) · Is
and (B − 1) · Is, whose magnitudes are smaller than ±Is in the
conventional method. Moreover, the time constants of the transients for
the proposed commutation scheme are much smaller. Thus, it is faster
for io to achieve its steady state. This further guarantees a smaller step
change and a standard squarewave form of io, which seriously affect
the performance of an arc-welding machine. Although the triggering
procedures for the proposed method seem more complex, it is easy to
be implemented by using a microprocessor-based controller.
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A prototype of a full-bridge CSI without snubbers is built to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed commutation method. The
commutation time is about 450 µs. Some important circuit parameters
are listed as follows: Is = 50 A, RCEj = 30 mΩ, Ro = 50 mΩ, and
Lo = 7 µH. Fig. 3 shows the driving signals, the io, and the resulting
voltage spikes for the conventional and the proposed control methods,
respectively. From Fig. 3(a), a step change about 50 A for io at the
end of commutation is observed. In Fig. 3(b), io starts decreasing to
zero when Q1 is turned off (the gating signal of Q1 is not shown).
Then, Q3 is turned on to further lower io to a level closer to −Is. The
step change of io when Q4 is turned off is about 35 A. In Fig. 3(c),
the maximum voltage spike is about 90 V, whereas in Fig. 3(d), it is
about 60 V. The voltage spike is cut down to 33% for the proposed
commutation scheme.
IV. CONCLUSION
The proposed commutation method for the full-bridge CSI in this
paper features a faster transient response of the output current. The
step change of the output current in the commutation period is reduced.
Thus, the resulted voltage spikes can be suppressed. For the applica-
tions in the arc-welding industry, where the output current can be up to
several hundreds of amperes, a more perfect squarewave output current
can be obtained. In addition, the snubber circuits, if it is necessary for
them to be added, can be made smaller.

A High-Efficiency AC-to-DC Adaptor With a
Low Standby Power Consumption
Yu-Kang Lo, Shang-Chin Yen, and Chung-Yi Lin
Abstract—A two-stage burst mode control scheme for an ac-to-dc
adaptor is proposed in this paper. An upper limit for the output voltage is
set to turn off both ac/dc and dc/dc controllers at no load. The burst-mode
operations of the dc/dc and the ac/dc converters are in turn enabled
when reaching the lower limit of the output voltage. Load analysis at
standby mode is performed. A 50-mW no-load power loss is observed on an
80 W/12 V prototype adaptor.

control.
I. INTRODUCTION
Owing to the gradual exhaustion of usable energy, the exploitation
of various kinds of energies and restriction of energy use are now
becoming a common consensus worldwide. Most of the developed
countries have made appropriate energy policies for energy use. Adap-
tors are devices that convert incoming high voltage ac power from
wall outlets into low voltage dc power needed by various electronic
products. These power supplies represent the most obvious oppor-
tunity for energy savings. Roughly 75% of the total energy savings
opportunity is in products’ active or operational mode, rather than in
the standby or low power modes. Unfortunately, most current power
supplies are only 30% to 60% efficient when operating, and consume
1 to 3 W even with no product attached to them (no load) [1]–[3].
Improved designs are 70% to 90% efficient and consume less than
0.2 W at no load. The standards of power consumption in the standby
mode (i.e., green power) of electrical products are generally set below
0.5–1 W. Manufacturers of relevant electronic products have devel-
oped appropriate products (power-saving ICs, special-function control
ICs, power supplies and so on) for future probable system standards
and specifications.
Among several schemes, the burst mode control is the most com-
monly adopted to regulate the output voltage at light loads or even
no load [4], [5]. Under these load conditions, either the duty cycle
in the pulsewidth modulation control cannot be further reduced, or
the switching frequency in the frequency modulation control reaches
its highest value. The output voltage may increase beyond its upper

output in a preset time. The conversion efficiency at full load is
measured via a power analyzer (PM100 by Voltech) after a 30-min
warm-up period. Then the efficiencies at 75%, 50%, and 25% loads
are recorded after every 5 min. The no-load loss is calculated by
dividing the accumulated energy by the measuring time length.
Detailed measurements are listed in Table I. The average PF is 0.988
and the average efficiency for the four active modes is nearly 90%.
The switching frequency range is from 59 to 220 kHz. Notably, the
accumulated energy over a 30-min period is 24.75 mW · h. That is,
the power consumption at no load is only 50 mW under the proposed
two-stage burst mode control scheme.
To verify the accuracy of the measured no-load consumption, a loss
analysis is carried out. The results are summarized in Table II. Some
parameters are defined as follows:
VCC operating voltages of all ICs;
IQ quiescent currents of all ICs;
Vrec peak rectified input ac voltage;
Rstart total resistance of the PFC starter circuit;
Vo(PFC) output voltage of the PFC at no load;
Rfb(PFC) total resistance of the PFC feedback sensor circuit;
Rfb total resistance of the SPRC feedback sensor circuit;
Rbm total resistance of the burst-mode controller.
The approximated no-load loss of the PFC is 16.6 mW, while the
standby power consumption of the SPRC is about 30.6 mW. From
Fig. 3(b), it should be noticed that the PFC is disabled during most of
the standby mode. Therefore, the output voltage of the PFC at no-load
is approximately equal to the peak rectified input ac voltage. Taking
into account other negligible power consumptions and those difficult

to be estimated at no-load, the calculated standby loss is very close to
the measured value.
IV. CONCLUSION
The proposed two-stage burst mode control features very low
standby power consumption. Also, the adoptions of the DCM PFC and
the HB-SPRC for the main power circuits promote the active-mode
efficiencies. One possible arrangement of the burst mode controller is
presented and tested in this paper. Experimental results confirm the
feasibility of the proposed two-stage burst mode control, which is suit-
able for reducing the no-load loss of the multistage power converters.
