make use of this common resonance of SPP and LSP, we design metallic nanostructures 
consisting of two metallic circular cylinders partially embedded in a metallic half-space by the 
simulated annealing (SA) method to achieve the effective coupling between the SP modes and 
a dipole source. 
We use the boundary integral-equation method (BIEM) [13] to numerically simulate the 
coupling effect of SPP and LSP with a dipole source. One of the advantages of BIEM is that 
the unknown equivalent electric and magnetic currents are all at the boundaries of structures, 
reducing the number of unknown variables and saving the computing time. We then use the 
simulated annealing (SA) method [14,15] to synthesize the optimal metallic nanostructures. 
The SA is a probabilistic and iterative method of optimization mimicking the real annealing 
process of matter. A cost function, analogous to energy, is defined for minimization during the 
iteration process. In this study, we define the parameter “downward emission” as the power 
radiated by the dipole in the direction away from the metallic structure and define the cost 
function as the minus value of the downward emission. Through iteration, the probability of 
choosing the bad structure is reduced when the prescribed temperature gradually decreases, 
and thus we can obtain the global minimum without being trapped at a local minimum.  
The insert of Figure 1 shows the schematic structure which we try to optimize. The metal 
is Ag, and the surrounding dielectric is GaN. We choose three variable parameters to adjust 
the structure. The parameter r is the radius of each circular cylinder, d is the separation 
between centers of the two cylinders, and t is the distance from the center of each cylinder to 
the plane of flat metal, i.e., y = 0. The position of the dipole is set at (x, y) = (0, -h), with h 
being the distance from the dipole to the flat metal. Normally, we set h = r+t, unless specified 
otherwise. We synthesize the optimal structures by adjusting these parameters to maximize 
the downward emission by using the SA method. The Drude model is employed to describe 
the dielectric constant of Ag, with the angular plasma frequency 161019.1 ×=pω  rad s 1−  and 
the damping constant 141032.1 ×=γ  rad s 1− . It is well known that the SPP resonant frequency 
of a metallic half-space is / 1pω ε+  [ ]11 , where ε  is the dielectric constant of the 
surrounding dielectric. Now the dielectric constant of GaN is set to be 6.25. Based on the 
Drude model, we calculate the SPP resonant wavelength of the plane metal to be at 430nm. In 
our numerical simulation, however, a dipole cannot supply infinite wave numbers, so we 
choose a slightly longer wavelength at 435nm for optimization. In order to manifest the 
advantage of the effective coupling between SPP and LSP, we also consider another structure 
for optimization at wavelength 520 nm for comparison. Through adjusting variable 
parameters, the optimal structure at wavelength 520 nm has mainly the LSP effect. We denote 
the structure optimized at 435 nm as “structure A” and that optimized at 520nm as “structure 
B”. After optimization by SA, the parameters of structure A are: r = 10 nm, d = 68 nm, t = 0.8 
nm, h = 10.8 nm, and the parameters of structure B are: r = 14 nm, d = 60 nm, t = 7.6 nm, h = 
21.6 nm. Figure 1 shows the variation of downward emission during iteration. The green 
curve represents the chosen temperature distribution used in SA process. The red curve shows 
the optimization process for downward emission at wavelength 435 nm and the blue curve 
indicates the optimization process for downward emission at wavelength 520 nm. From these 
curves, we can find that the SA process indeed converges to the optimal structures. Note that 
parameter r of structure B is larger than that of structure A. The reason is that as the resonant 
wavelength red shifts from 435 nm to 520 nm, the size of the system should become bigger. 
There may be two ways for enlarging the size of the system. One is to increase the separation 
between the two cylinders and the other is to increase the sizes of cylinders. Since the cylinder 
cannot be too far away from the source dipole for effectively exciting the LSP effect, the 
cylinder radius then becomes larger for optimization at a longer wavelength.  
Figure 2 shows the spectra of the downward emission for structures A, B and C. Here, 
 4
between SPP and LSP is weak. The emission enhancement is worst when both SPP and LSP 
are weak.
