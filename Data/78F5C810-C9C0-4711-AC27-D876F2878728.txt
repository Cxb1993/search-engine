一、中文摘要
台灣一直都沒有屬於自己的成衣尺碼
標準，所以成衣廠商傳統的生產模式都是
直接修改歐美日等國的尺碼資料，致使國
內成衣尺碼因廠而異，除外國的尺寸不適
合國人的體型外，由於無法掌握臺灣民眾
體型的趨勢，致使國內廠商必須囤積大量
庫存，造成資金積壓與成本的損失，以上
種種皆造成台灣成衣產業的升級瓶頸，因
此建立成衣的尺碼標準對生產廠商是非常
重要的。本研究針對台灣女性的人體計測
資料，利用資料挖礦從大量的資料中進行
探索和分析，挖掘出有關聯的規則及趨
勢，建立各種體型的成衣生產尺碼標準，
並對台灣的成衣產業有所助益。
關鍵詞：人體計測資料、資料挖礦、尺碼

Abstract
Standard body size charts can correctly
predict numbers of items and ratio of sizes to
be produced, resulting in accurate inventory
control and production planning. Due to
differences in the body types of people in
different countries, each country must have
its own standard body size charts for
manufacturers and consumers to follow.
Under traditional production procedures,
Taiwan has not yet developed its own size
charts. Most garments are manufactured
using revised overseas sizing data; as a result,
garment sizes differ from factory to factory,
with no consistent standards. Apart from the
fact that most overseas sizing data do not
correspond to Taiwanese body types,
consumers must choose suitable garments by
trial and error, resulting in enormous
inconvenience, not to mention wasted time
and money. Thus, the development of
standard body size charts for garment
manufacturers and consumers is long
overdue. Data mining approach has been
successfully applied in many domains.
However, there is lack of research in
establishing garment size charts by using the
data mining approach. This study proposes a
data mining approach to develop the body
size charts for clothing production. It
analyzes a large female anthropometric
database by data mining technique to identify
systematic rules for classification. Based on
these rules, the typical body types can be
classified, and the body size charts can be
developed. Since female body types and
dimensions can be changeable, the proposed
data mining continually updates the
anthropometric database and develops the
latest body size charts. These revised body
size charts exactly represents body types and
dimensions, allowing manufacturers and
consumers access to the latest body size
charts, facilitating garment production for
Taiwan.

Garment, an important issue, plays an
even more important role throughout human
life so garment production is a high

2.2.1 Factor analysis
However, using all 12 anthropometric
variables to establishing the size charts will
make the study unduly complicated. Therefore,
this study used factor analysis to extract
important factors. Folowing Kaiser’s 
eigenvalue criterion, two factors whose
eigenvalues were greater than 1 were selected
[6, 7]. The factor loadings were then calculated
to find the correlation coefficients between the
two factors and the anthropometric variables.
Factor 1 and Factor 2 can be easily explained.
Anthropometric variables with factor loadings
of over 0.7 cluster in Factors 1 and 2.
Most of the variables that appeared in
Factor 1 were girth-related variables including
bust girth, waist girth, hip girth, neck girth,
wrist girth, bust width, back width and shoulder
width. The variables that appeared in Factor 2
were height-related variables including body
height, cervical height, arm length and back
waist length as shown in Table 2.
