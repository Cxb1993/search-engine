temperature required to change the mechanical 
behavior (Laser-assisted cutting) or the phase 
(Laser machining) of the ceramic and at the 
high end by temperatures and temperature 
gradients that cause thermal damage to 
unmachined portions of the workpiece. 
Accurate temperature analysis (a 
thermo-mechanical process model) during 
laser-assisted cutting and laser machining is 
needed to elucidate physical phenomena. 
Subsurface temperatures of material in the 
deformation zone associated with material 
removal determine how the material deforms 
or transforms and subsequently how it is 
removed. While such temperatures are 
extremely difficult to measure [7], they may be 
inferred by using an appropriate 
thermo-mechanical model. Because the 
optimal temperature of operation is narrow, 
accurate analysis of workpiece surface 
temperatures is required for successful control 
of the cutting processes. 
Heat transfer analysis is of crucial 
importance in materials manufacturing and 
processing [8,9]. This is also due to the 
availability of new materials and to the use of 
innovative processes employing laser and 
electron beam. These high power beams are 
now widely used in many applications, such as 
welding, drilling, cutting, heat treating of 
metals and manufacturing of electronic 
components. It is, therefore, necessary to study 
the conductive thermal fields induced in the 
solid by a moving heat source. Pittaway [10] 
solved the temperature distribution in an 
adiabatic thin plate with either stationary or 
moving circular Gaussian heat source. For the 
same heat sources Lolov [11] derived the 
solution to the three dimentional linear 
problem in a finite depth and indefinite width 
adiabatic body, where Tsai and Hou [12] 
analyzed, for a solid whose dimension along 
the direction perpendicular to that of the 
motion was finite, the thermal characterization 
of the welding both at steady-state and 
transient conditions. The same problem was 
solved by Kar and Mazumder [13]; their 
model allowed the determination of the 
transient three-dimensional temperature 
distribution in a solid whose thermophysical 
properties, except the thermal diffusivity, were 
assumed to be time dependent. Manca [14] 
developed an analytical solution to the 
three-dimensional quasi-stationary problem in 
a finite depth and width with a circular 
Gaussian moving heat source at the body 
surface. 
Rozzi et al [15] developed a transient, 
three-dimensional heat transfer model for laser 
assisted machining of silicon nitride, which 
considered convection, radiation heat fluxes, 
material removal, thermal energy generation 
due to plastic deformation and tool-workpiece 
friction. Therefore this model is complicated 
and must be solved by numerical method. 
Similar to the model provided by Rozzi et al, 
A heat transfer model was proposed to analyze 
the effects of feed rate and laser power on 
temperature during laser-assisted machining of 
semi-transparent ceramics [16]. While the 
transient, three-dimensional thermal model [16] 
also considered radiation heat fluxes, 
convection, and material removal, the 
numerical solutions obtained from it were not 
so consistent with the measured data as we 
expected. This paper neglects the insignificant 
factors to establish a simple and practicable 
thermal model for the laser-assisted cutting of 
ceramics. The analytical solution of the 
present thermal model is obtained and agrees 
well with the measured data. The effects of 
feed rate and laser power on temperature 
history are also discussed in this study. 
 
ANALYSIS 
 
2.1 System Description 
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of 
the ceramics-cutting system considered in this 
analysis. The workpiece of ceramics rotates in 
constant revolutions per minute (RPM). The 
laser optics are attached to the lathe turret that 
provides translation in the axial and radial 
directions of the workpiece, and axial 
translation of the laser optics is synchronized 
with that of the cutting tool during 
laser-assisted cutting. The laser optics preheats 
the workpiece before the cutting tool performs 
the ablation of ceramics.

n and k correspondingly are 1.501 and 0.0236 
for CO2 laser of wavelength 10.6 μ m. 
Therefore the reflectivity R is approximately 
0.05 (absorptivity=0.95)[7] for p-polarization 
and =0 (zero angle degree of incidence). 1θ
 
2.4 Governing equation and boundary 
conditions 
In the beginning of cutting the transient 
temperature rises from the ambient 
temperature. However when the laser source is 
away from the ends of the workpiece and 
moves with a constant velocity as the feed rate 
of cutting tool, the system will finally 
approach a quasi-steady-state for an infinite 
workpiece and sufficiently high velocity of 
rotation (RPM). The workpiece is only heated 
to the high temperature that reduces the yield 
strength of ceramics below the fracture 
strength but not the melting temperature. 
Hence this cutting process can be modeled by 
heat conduction equation neglecting phase 
change and this problem can be also 
formulated in a cylindrical coordinate system 
that moves with the laser beam or cutting tool 
due to the system symmetrical to z-axis.

we know, the increasing feed rate enhances the 
heat loss taken away by material removal, heat 
dissipation due to the movement of laser 
source and heat generated by cutting. The 
present model neglects heat loss taken away 
by material removal and heat generated by 
cutting. Therefore as the temperature histories 
predicted by the present model are compared 
with these measured by Pfefferkorn et al [7], 
figure 3 indicates that the effect of heat 
generation due to cutting on temperature is 
significant for the case of feed rate 32mm/min 
but heat loss taken away by material removal 
and heat generated by cutting are negligible 
for the cases of feed rates 8mm/min and 
16mm/min.

temperature histories at the location directly 
irradiated by laser on the workpiece surface 
for different feed rates. 
 
Based on the moving coordinate, figure 4 
and 5, respectively, illustrate temperature 
distributions in the z and r direction for 
different times. In the z direction, figure 4 
shows that the temperature on the workpiece 
surface is highest at z=0.0016m (the location 
directly irradiated by laser) and then decreases 
with the increasing distance away from the 
location directly irradiated by laser. The 
temperature gradients at the region between 
z=0.004m and z=-0.002m do not obviously 
vary with time. On the other hand, the 
temperature gradients decrease with the 
increasing time at the location z < -0.002m. It 
is also found that the temperature gradient in 
+z direction is larger than that in the –z 
direction at the region between z=0.004m and 
z=-0.002m because the laser moves toward +z 
direction. In the r direction of temperature 
distributions as plotted in Fig. 5, at the 
location z=0.0016m the temperature abruptly 
decreases from r=0.0075m to r=0.005m and 
then slowly from r=0.005m to r=0. 
Temperatures rise quickly in the beginning and 
then slowly with the increasing time. 
Based on the moving coordinare, figures 
6(a)-(d) demonstrate the temperature contours 
within r-z plane at different times. The contour 
spacing in the -z direction increases with time 
faster than that in the +z direction. 
Consequently the temperature contours move 
toward –z direction when the time increases. 
This indicates that the temperature gradient in 
-z direction becomes smaller with time than 
that in the +z direction. On the other hand, the 
temperature gradient against the radial 
direction is insignificant except the 
neighborhood of the location directly 
irradiated by laser where the temperature 
distributions in the r direction are similar to 
these in Fig. 5. 
The r-z temperature contours for feed rates 
8mm/min and 32mm/min are sketched in Fig. 
7(a) and (b), respectively. The contour spacing 
in the +z direction is obviously smaller than 
that in the –z direction for the case of feed rate 
32mm/min. This is because there is no time 
enough to dissipate the heat in the +z direction 
due to high feed rate of cutting tool or laser. 
Figure 8 indicates the temperature history at 
the location of laser source for different beam 
radii. The small beam diameter results in the 
high temperature due to high intensity of laser 
heat flux.

CONCLUSIONS r 
 
A thermal model is provided to analyze the 
temperature history for laser-assisted cutting 
of ceramics. The analytical solution from the 
present model is obtained. The temperature 
histories predicted by this model agree with 
these measured by Pfefferkorn et al for 
different laser powers and feed rates. The 
temperature history increases rapidly at first 
and then slowly to reach steady values. The 
temperature gradient in +z direction is larger 
than that in the –z direction due to the 
movement of laser source toward +z direction. 
The contour spacing in the -z direction 
increases with time faster than that in the +z 
direction. Consequently the temperature 
contours move toward –z direction when the 
time increases. This indicates that the 
temperature gradient in -z direction becomes 
smaller with time than that in the +z direction. 
The temperatures increase with the increasing 
laser power, decreasing feed rate and beam 
diameter.

2. Analysis 
 
2.1 System Description 
Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the ceramics-cutting 
system considered in this analysis. The workpiece of ceramics 
rotates in constant revolutions per minute (RPM). The laser optics 
are attached to the lathe turret that provides translation in the axial 
and radial directions of the workpiece, and axial translation of the 
laser optics is synchronized with that of the cutting tool during 
laser-assisted cutting. The laser optics preheats the workpiece 
before the cutting tool performs the ablation of ceramics. 
Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of laser-assisted cutting and 
coordinates. 
 
2.2 Assumptions 
It is difficult to obtain the analytical solution of the mathematical 
model including all the details. In order to get a simple and 
practicable model some assumptions are made as follows 
(i) The system is supposed to be two dimensions (2-D) for 
sufficiently high RPM and the workpiece symmetrical to 
z-axis. 
(ii) The heat loss taken away by removal material is neglected due 
to a small depth-of-cut (~0.5 ㎜). 
(iii) Compared with the heat flux of the incident laser, the heat 
flux generated by shear plane heat source, rake face heat 
source, and wear-land heat source is assumed to be 
negligible in the process of cutting ceramics. 
(iv) The maximal surface temperature on the workpiece is about 
1500 K  for the laser-assisted cutting of zirconia ceramics. 
The radiation of this surface temperature is estimated by 
4Tσ  and is the order of 22 cm/W10  which is negligible 
compared with the order of 24 cm/W10 for the intensity of 
incident laser. 
 
2.3 Radiative properties of Zirconia ceramics 
Zirconia ceramics (ZrO2) will be used as a workpiece in this 
study. The fully-dense, sintered zirconia [17] exhibits strong 
absorption above 5 μ m, where its optical properties are 
represented by the complex index of refraction, mλ=nλ-ikλ, and  
kλ is the extinction coefficient. Scattering is more significant than 
absorption forλ< 5μm and scattering vanishes as the size of the 
scattering centers decreases relative toλfor λ> 7μm. Hence the 
absorption of radiation forλ> 7μm depends more on material 
composition and crystal structure than on physical characteristics 
such as grain size, porosity, and glassy phase content, which vary 
significantly with the manner in which the ceramic is processed. 
A 0.73mm thick, titania-yttria-zirconia ceramic was processed by 
isostatic pressing and had a spectral transmissivity greater than 60 
percent in the visible spectrum, but was opaque above 8μm [18]. 
2.5mm thick thermal-barrier-coatings of plasma-sprayed zirconia 
were found to be highly opaque beyond 5μm [19]. These results 
suggest  that while variations in chemical composition and 
processing can significantly affect the radiative properties of 
zirconia in the visible and near-infrared spectra, all of the 
materials become opaque above some cutoff wavelength. The 
variations of refractive index and extinction coefficient with 
wavelength were shown for zirconia ceramics [7]. According to 
the Fresnel’s formula the reflectivity R follows as

3. Results and discussion 
 
According to the above-mentioned assumptions and derivations, 
the transient temperature field for laser-assisted cutting of 
ceramics can be obtained from the equation (18). In order to 
conveniently compare the analytical solutions with the available 
measured data from the laser-assisted cutting of zirconia ceramics, 
the dimensional parameters were used in this study. These 
dimensional parameters include laser power Q , feed rate U , 
beam diameter σ , and laser-tool lead 0z . The typical values of 
Q , U , σ  and 0z  were correspondingly chosen to be 200W, 
16mm/min, 2mm and 1.6mm. The effects of dimensional 
parameters on temperature histories were discussed in the 
following figures. 
Figure 2 shows the variation of temperature at the location of 
laser source with time for different laser powers. The 
temperatures increase rapidly before ten seconds and then slowly 
to reach steady values. The high power gives rise to a high 
surface temperature at the location irradiated by a laser. The 
temperature histories obtained from the measurement of the 
laser-assisted cutting of zirconia ceramics are also shown in this 
figure and agree with these predicted by this model.

location directly irradiated by laser on the workpiece surface for 
different feed rates. 
 
The effect of feed rate on temperature history at the location of 
laser irradiation is sketched in Fig. 3. The predicted temperatures 
by this work agree well with the experimental data for the cases 
of feed rates 8mm/min and 16mm/min. However the errors 
between the predicted and measured data are large and the present 
model underestimates the temperature for the case of feed rate 
32mm/min. As far as we know, the increasing feed rate enhances 
the heat loss taken away by material removal, heat dissipation due 
to the movement of laser source and heat generated by cutting. 
The present model neglects heat loss taken away by material 
removal and heat generated by cutting. Therefore as the 
temperature histories predicted by the present model are 
compared with these measured by Pfefferkorn et al [7], figure 3 
indicates that the effect of heat generation due to cutting on 
temperature is significant for the case of feed rate 32mm/min but 
heat loss taken away by material removal and heat generated by 
cutting are negligible for the cases of feed rates 8mm/min and 
16mm/min. 
Based on the moving coordinate, figure 4 and 5, respectively, 
illustrate temperature distributions in the z and r direction for 
different times. In the z direction, figure 4 shows that the 
temperature on the workpiece surface is highest at z=0.0016m 
(the location directly irradiated by laser) and then decreases with 
the increasing distance away from the location directly irradiated 
by laser. The temperature gradients at the region between 
z=0.004m and z=-0.002m do not obviously vary with time. On 
the other hand, the temperature gradients decrease with the 
increasing time at the location z < -0.002m. It is also found that 
the temperature gradient in +z direction is larger than that in 
the –z direction at the region between z=0.004m and z=-0.002m 
because the laser moves toward +z direction. In the r direction of 
temperature distributions as plotted in Fig. 5, at the location 
z=0.0016m the temperature abruptly decreases from r=0.0075m 
to r=0.005m and then slowly from r=0.005m to r=0. Temperatures 
rise quickly in the beginning and then slowly with the increasing 
time.  
Based on the moving coordinare, figures 6(a)-(d) demonstrate 
the temperature contours within r-z plane at different times. The 
contour spacing in the -z direction increases with time faster than 
that in the +z direction. Consequently the temperature contours

4. Conclusions 
 
A thermal model is provided to analyze the temperature history 
for laser-assisted cutting of ceramics. The analytical solution from 
the present model is obtained. The temperature histories predicted 
by this model agree with these measured by Pfefferkorn et al for 
different laser powers and feed rates. The temperature history 
increases rapidly at first and then slowly to reach steady values. 
The temperature gradient in +z direction is larger than that in 
the –z direction due to the movement of laser source toward +z 
direction. The contour spacing in the -z direction increases with 
time faster than that in the +z direction. Consequently the 
temperature contours move toward –z direction when the time 
increases. This indicates that the temperature gradient in -z 
direction becomes smaller with time than that in the +z direction. 
The temperatures increase with the increasing laser power, 
decreasing feed rate and beam diameter.
