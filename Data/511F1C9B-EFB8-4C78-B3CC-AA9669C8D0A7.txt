the artifact, the corresponding covariance matrices would be significantly 
different. This study finds a rule of single linkage to discriminate outliers 
in repeated measurements based on similarities among them. 
The measurement tool is MicroScribe G2; the display software is 
Rhino; and the analysis tool is XploRe. We convert a covariance matrix 
into a 1x6 vector and by using principal components analysis the vector is 
projected into a 2D point. Thirty points are chosen among the domains to 
explore different profiles of the artifact. Next cluster analysis is applied to 
the 30 points in the 2D graph to find points which share the common 
covariance matrix. This further renders a pooled covariance matrix for 
points within a 0.2 mm square which inscribes the most crowded points in 
the projected 2D principal components. Then 2000 pairs of simulated 
points from the pooled covariance matrix are generated, and the distance 
between the pair points is calculated. The sample mean and standard 
deviation of the distance are obtained and the upper limit, mean plus the 
three standard deviations, is used as an empirical single linkage threshold.

The 2nd International Conference on Systematic Innovation 
May 26-28, 2011, Shanghai, China  
2008, Kadoya, S., Kuroko, T. and Namatame, T. 2010). Each strategy has its own strength. Various 
scholars hold preference on their own strategy according to the empirical result they found on 
different region in different time period and based on different theory (See the references cited 
therein Li etal, Naughton etal and Kadoyo etal). As for the school of momentum investing, it is 
believed that investments that have performed relatively well continues to perform relatively well 
and vice versa, thus it encourages buying hot stocks. Whereas the contrarian strategy encourages 
stock players buy value stock and sell hot stocks. Still some researchers focus on the forecast of the 
stock price based on some kind of tools such as neural network, statistical regression, fuzzy set, time 
series, etc (Horng ,Z.C. 2009 and Beaver, W., Cornell, B., Landsman, W.R., and Stubben, S.R. 
2008).  
Although different aspects are addressed on the stock prices, they all have something in 
common. First, all the data they used to verify the proposed methods or strategy are based on 
previous records, thus a retro-perspective approach. Second, all the techniques involve moderate and 
heavy mathematical computation, a skill demands specialty and profound knowledge. However, the 
question we would like to propose here is “Who will involve in stock exchange? Are they all skillful 
in mathematical computation?” The answer is obvious. Most people in Taiwan involve in stock 
exchange and the majority of them are laymen in terms of the financial knowledge. Moreover, most 
of them lack of skill in performing complex computation. According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange 
there are over fifteen million stock accounts up to the end of the 2009.  Based on such a large 
population in stock market and the majority of them has little financial knowledge and minimum 
tool for complex computation, an interesting and challenging question arise in us: is it possible to 
develop a free, user friendly and useful stock strategy for those people? And that strategy should 
help the stock investors earn a rate of return better than the long term deposit interest rate in the bank. 
Thus this draws attention to us to develop such strategy so that it is free and easy to use and most 
important it works. The verification of its performance should be tested based on the future data, not 
the historical records, to make this strategy more realistic.   
2. Development of the Strategy 
Before we set out to find a strategy, the objective of the investment strategy should be defined 
clearly. It is clear that different objective has its unique strategy. The objective of the strategy is to 
help investors earn a rate of return over 10% given a minimum of NTD 500,000. The way the 
objective is defined is because the average long term deposit interest rate in Taiwan for the last ten 
years is about 1~5%. The bank of Taiwan issues a trend of one year deposit interest rate for the last 
10 years shows that the variation of interest rate in Table 1. If the rate of return from the strategy is 
higher than the interest rate, then the strategy can be considered as a good performance strategy. 
Since this is the first launch of the strategy project, a conservative rate of return with 10% is set. 
After important issue is the lump sum money we should endorse. There are many high schools and 
college departments use the funny money to train the students how to learn the investment strategy.

May 26-28, 2011, Shanghai, China  
gross profit margin, operating profit margin and Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), 
to name a few (Fernandez-Blanco, P., etal 2008). Ones choose the gross profit margin, operating 
profit margin, pre-tax profit margin and after-tax profit margin in the most recent season financial 
report as the profit making indicators of a stock. Two reasons of choosing them as indicators are: 1. 
they are easy to understand, and 2. they can be freely assessed in the internet service. To solve the 
problem of choosing a low price stock, a contrarian strategy is implemented with the 72 consecutive 
closing prices of the stock. Note that this information is also freely assessed in the internet. If the 
stock closing price decreases in the recent five days and the current closing price falls within the 
bottom 20% of the price range of its 72 consecutive closing prices, then one considers the stock price 
is below the stock intrinsic value. Under the contrarian strategy, that kind of stock is worthy to buy 
and has great potential in making good profit in the future. No theoretical justification can be 
provided for this proposition. However, retro-perspective analysis shows the proposition is 
reasonable and will be elucidated in different paper.  
With those views in mind, three rules for choosing the quality stock are listed: 1. the current 
stock price must be in the bottom 20% in the price range of closing prices in the recent 72 
transaction days, 2. the gross profit margin, operating profit margin, pre-tax profit margin and 
after-tax profit margin in the current season financial report must all be positive, 3. the stock holding 
rate by board of directors must be greater than 5.5%. The last rule is added to make sure that the 
managerial level of the stock company hold accountable for their performance. The value of 5.5% is 
recommended by the monetary authority in Taiwan. If the stock holding rate of the board directors is 
too low, then they can escape away from their poor performance in managing the stock company. 
However, if the stock holding rate is too high, it will do no good for the circulation of the stock. The 
fluctuation of the stock price will not be much which will render a low turn over rate of the stock 
exchange. But this issue will not be pursued here in this paper. All the rules can be implemented 
using the free internet service from the bank of Taiwan. The detail operation will be shown step by 
step in the paragraph below. Thus the implementation of three rules covers the equipotentiality and 
resource in TRIZ. For the resource from super-system, the required information in the rules is 
retrieved from the free internet service of bank of Taiwan. Everything is free. As for the 
equipotentiality, people do not need to study too much in finance and stock investment, the rules are 
intuitively appealing. They are self-explained. There is no barrier to climb over in order to use this 
strategy. The implementation of the three rules fit the core values of equipotentiality. After 
completing the rules for choosing a stock, the rules for selling a stock are discussed. 
There are three situations to sell a stock: one is for profit reaping, the second for stopping 
bleeding (i.e. keep losing money), and the last one is the poor updated financial report. As ones 
mentioned before a good situation to sell the stock is when its rate of return is over 10%. This is the 
good situation we all expect to happen, but real life does not always go this way. Thus a precaution 
umbrella is needed for the rainy days. How about the stock price keeps going down? When should 
we sell the stock to stop bleeding and save the money for the next stock candidate? Ones use 30%

4. Conclusions 
People have psychology inertia in insisting that good solution in engineering or managerial 
problems always involve highly mathematical tools and profound knowledge. However according to 
the TRIZ ideality things should happen by themselves. The best solution should always tap the 
resource from the super-system to solve the problem in the proposed system. This research uses the 
equipotentiality and resource in TRIZ to tackle a strategy problem in stock investment. The aim is to 
find a strategy such that people with minimum knowledge in finance and stock investment can do 
the stock investment without paying extra money. Usually the majority laymen in stock investment 
pay the money to join some club in order to buy some good stock information. However the 
information does not guarantee the stock will make profit. Still others buy some sophisticated 
software and interpret the result with their own knowledge to make the investment judgment. All 
those required resource from the system. In our case, the investors need to pay for the purchase of 
information. Contrary to all the above methods, our proposed method is free and easy to use. 
Three rules for choosing the quality stock are listed: 1. the current stock price must be in the 
bottom 20% in the price range of closing prices in the recent 72 transaction days, 2. the gross profit 
margin, operating profit margin, pre-tax profit margin and after-tax profit margin in the season 
financial report must all be positive, 3. the stock holding rate by board of directors must be greater 
than 5.5%. In additions, there are three situations to sell a stock: one is for profit reaping, the second 
for stopping bleeding (i.e. keep losing money), and the last one is the poor updated financial report. 
A good situation to sell the stock is when its rate of return is over 10%. This is the good situation we 
all expect to happen, but real life does not always go this way. Thus a precaution umbrella is needed 
for the rainy days. Ones use 30% loss as the threshold when the stock price keeps going down. 
Lastly, when the updated financial report contains negative gross profit margin, operating profit 
margin, pre-tax profit margin or after-tax profit margin, the stock should be sold out. 
A perspective experiment is implemented by one of the author from 2009/10 to 2011/02 with 
NTD 500,000 as the lump sum capital. Nine stocks have been purchased and sold with each ROR 
more than 10%. Two out of nine transactions share identical stocks. Among them, the shortest 
investment period is eight days, whereas the longest period is about three months. The total ROR for 
the investment is 25.56% which is very promising.

▪Appendix 
We use the sorting table of the first 30 drawdown stock to demonstrate the entry point of 
choosing the possible stock candidates. The date is 2010-07-10. The maximum drawdown stock is 
stock 5340 with the drawdown rate of -6.67%. The fourth drawdown stock, which is circled in red 
rectangle, is stock 8927 with the drawdown rate of -5.08%. It is in stock 8927 we find the promising 
stock to buy after trying out the first three stocks.
