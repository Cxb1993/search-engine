II. LITURATURE SURVEY 
Recently, lattice-reduction aided detectors (LRADs) have been proposed to narrow the 
performance gap between the ML and the traditional reduced-complexity detectors [12-21]. 
Basically, this scheme transforms (through lattice reduction) the MIMO system into an equivalent 
one with a better-conditioned channel, where an initial detection is made with a 
reduced-complexity detector. The estimate is then transformed back to the original system to 
obtain the final decision.  It has been shown that LRAD can significantly outperform the 
traditional reduced-complexity detectors [12-21]. LRAD is particularly attractive in a quasi-static 
channel, where the lattice reduction is needed to be done once at the beginning of each frame.   
The Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) [22] and the Seysen’s algorithms [23,16] are two most 
popular lattice-reduction algorithms used in LRAD. (The Gaussian reduction in [12] is a special 
case of LLL for the case 2, 2m n= = .) In this work, a new MMSE (minimum mean square error) 
channel factorization is proposed to improve the performance of LRADs. Numerical results show 
that the proposed factorization outperforms the existing ones and if used with the element-wise, 
candidate-list (EWCL) detector can approach to within a fractional dB of the ML performance.   
III. SYSTEM MODEL AND REDUCED-COMPLEXITY DETECTORS 
In this section, the detailed system model is given, and the traditional reduced-complexity 
detectors used in Section V are reviewed. We consider the MIMO system in (1) with n m≥ . 
[ ], 1 2i j mh⎡ ⎤= = ⋅⋅⋅⎣ ⎦H h h h is the channel matrix which consists of zero-mean, unit variance i.i.d. 
complex Gaussian variables; that is, the i.i.d. Rayleigh faded channel is assumed for each 
input-output pair. The channel is block-faded implying that it remains unchanged in a frame and 
is faded independently from frame to frame. The signal vector m∈Ωx  has i.i.d. entries with the 
power constraint 2 2xE mσ⎡ ⎤ =⎣ ⎦x , where 
2⋅ denotes the squared Euclidean norm, and 
[ ]1 Tnw w= ⋅⋅⋅w  is a circularly symmetric complex Gaussian vector with the correlation 
propagation which can be lessened if the sequence of detection of , 1ix i m= ⋅⋅⋅ is properly 
ordered. With the perfect ordering, SIC is equivalent to the well-known V-BLAST detector [6,7]. 
Ideally, the diversity order of detecting jx  is equal to 1n j− + , , 1, 1j m m= − ⋅⋅⋅ . 
  The list-based detector is another important class of reduced-complexity detectors [10-11]. In 
Section V, along with MMSE-LD and SIC, an element-wise, candidate-list detector will be used 
to compare the performance of different factorization algorithms. Specifically, in this method 
after filtered by

where { }2-1Ψ  arg  min   Ψm∈Ω= − ∈x zxx = D z x z , . 2K = will be used in Section V, where 
simulations are given to show that this selection is enough for the detector to approach closely to 
the ML performance.      
 
IV. CHANNEL-FACTORIZATION AIDED DETECTION 
LRAD has been proposed to improve the performance of the traditional detectors while retains a 
low complexity [12-21]. It was shown in [17,18] that LRAD achieves full diversity order. As to 
be discussed, LRAD can be viewed as a special case of a more general class of detection, called 
channel-factorization aided detection (CFAD), where channel factorization can be done with any 
algorithms including the LLL and Seysen’s lattice-reduction algorithms. 
Let { }1 2, , , m⋅ ⋅ ⋅h h h  be a set of linearly independent vectors in Cn . The set of points

the dual lattice simultaneously, it has a similar performance as that of LLL applied to the dual 
lattice, as to be shown in Section V.  
Any reduced-complexity detector, denoted by the function ( )f y  in Figure 1, can be used to 
obtain the initial estimate z . For example, ZF-LD and MMSE-LD in (2), SIC in (3),  or  
EWCL can be used with H  replaced by iH  and x  by z . Furthermore, the slicer is used to 
lower the detection complexity, which is perfectly fine for an infinite constellation because 
=z Dx m∈ Ζ for m∈Ζx . For a finite constellation, however, there is boundary error effect; that is, 
-1D z may not belong to mΩ . This explains why (5) is needed for the final detection.  
 
          
By applying singular-value-decomposition (SVD), the channel matrix H can be expressed as

where U and V are unitary matrices with dimension of n n× and m m× , respectively, and 
( )1 2diag , , , m= Δ Δ ⋅⋅⋅ ΔΔ  is an m m×  diagonal matrix with the singular values 
0,  1,...,k k mΔ > = . Using (10), the matrix A becomes  
H=A ϒ ϒ ,                                                          (11)

More generally, we have the following lemma. 
Lemma 1:  With ϒ in (11), H=A C C  if and only if C = Pϒ , where HP P = I  is an 
l m× matrix with l m≥ .  
Proof: For the if part, ( )HH H=C C = P Pϒ ϒ ϒ ϒ = Α . For the only if part, using (11), one 
gets H HC C = ϒ ϒ . Since ϒ  is nonsingular, 1H H− − =C C Iϒ ϒ . Identify 1−P = Cϒ , the proof is 
done.  
In addition,C = Pϒ  is full-ranked due to that ϒ is nonsingular and P  is full-ranked.

worthy to note that since at each step of updating updk kmse mse≤  and the minimal kmse  is 
bounded below, the algorithm converges, although it may not converge to the minimal kmse .  
 
VI. SIMULATION RESULTS 
This section provides simulations to compare the proposed detection and LRAD from both 
aspects of performance and complexity. In the simulations, the data vectors x  are transmitted on 
a frame-by-frame basis, with 200 data vectors per frame. Total of 410  frames are simulated. The 
channel is block faded; that is, H  remains unchanged over a frame and changes independently 
from frame to frame. Signal to noise power ratio (SNR) is defined as 2 2x wσ σ . Total of six 
factorization algorithms are considered, including  LLL working on the primal basis 
(LLL-primal), LLL working on dual lattice (LLL-dual), LLL working on extended lattice 
(LLL-extended), Syesen’s algorithm (SA), and the proposed Algorithm-I and Algorithm-II. The 
complex version of the LLL algorithm in [25] (with 0.999δ = ) is used whenever applicable. The 
Cholesky decomposition is used to obtain HA = C C  in Algorithm-I, and 3IN =  and

 in Algorithm-II. Table 3 is a summary of Dand iH  obtained by using different 
channel factorization algorithms, where we can see that the difference between different 
LLL-based algorithms is the lattice to be reduced.  In addition, MMSE-LD, EWCL and the 
sorted SIC with i =H QR in [15] are used as the reduced-complexity detectors. For 
LLL-based methods (LLL-primal, LLL-dual, LLL-extended and Algorithm-I) and SA all have a 
variable complexity; LLL-primal has the less complexity, then Algorithm-I, LLL-extended, 
LLL-dual and SA. The same order of complexity is observed for other cases not shown here. 
Algorithm-I is slightly more complex than LLL-primal because of the extra complexity for the 
factorization of A . In addition, in this specific example, Algorithm-II is more complex than the 
LLL-based algorithm for most of the channel realizations (over 95%) and than SA for about 50% 
of the channel realizations. Nevertheless, Algorithm–II has a fixed complexity which is 
considered to be advantageous in hardware implementation. Finally, it is noted that the channel 
factorization is needed to be performed once at the beginning of a frame for a block-faded 
channel; the complexity of channel factorization is not a dominant factor in determining the 
overall complexity of detection.  
 
VII. CONCLUSIONS 
In this work, we investigate the issue of reduced-complexity MIMO detection for a near 
maximum-likelihood performance. A new MMSE channel factorization is proposed to improve 
the well known lattice-reduction aided detector (LRAD). Numerical results show that the new 
method provides significant gain over LRAD if MMSE-LD or EWCL is used as the 
reduced-complexity detector while the performance gain is diminishing if the sorted SIC is 
employed.  Furthermore, it is shown that the new channel factorization used along with EWCL 
can approach to within a fractional dB of ML performance.

有一連串的 presentation 跟 post)，因為自己的研究域是較偏於通訊
系統中實體層 (PHY)的訊號處理 (signal processing)及演算法
(algorithm)、甚至結合錯誤更正碼(error correction code)的部分，所
以這幾天中有參與聆聽的 presentation 的文章內容均屬於
Communication Theory、Detection and Estimation或 Signal Processing
等之類的 tracks。 
二、 與會內容及心得 
首先要說明的是在第一天下午的最後一個 section 中，有關
於自已 work 的 presentation 的部分。文章的標題為 MMSE channel 
factorization for near maximum-likelihood detection of MIMO 
signals。內容是在描述利用一個通道分解的技術，將其使用在多重
傳輸及接收天線的通訊系統中，能夠達到接近於最佳之訊號偵測效
能，即最大可能性偵則之結果。整個 presentation的過程還算流暢，
但可能是因為投影片的數量過多(會後經在場聆聽的老師的描述及
建議下)或時間控制不佳，導致報告最後有點倉促結束的感覺，也因
為時間已經到了，所以就沒有讓下面的聽眾提問，也就少了跟現場
互動的機會。 
不過，在隔天的會議中，剛好遇到在我前一篇報告的作者，
