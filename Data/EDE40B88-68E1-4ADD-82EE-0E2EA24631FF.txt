ABSTRACT 
The Taguchi capability index Cpm has been proposed to the manufacturing 
industry for measuring manufacturing capability.  Investigations of the 
estimated Taguchi capability index based on subsamples have been proposed 
and arrested substantial research attention.  In this report, investigation based 
on subsamples is considered for normal and near normal processes from the 
traditional distribution frequency approach.  A reliable inferential procedure 
based on subsamples of the estimated Taguchi capability index is proposed.  
The limiting distribution of the considered estimator was derived.  A practical 
example is provided to demonstrate how the proposed procedure may be applied 
for judging whether the process runs under the desirable quality requirement.

2. Sampling Distributions of the Estimated Cpm
2-1. Distribution of  with Single Sample pmCˆ
Assuming that the measurements of the characteristic investigated, (X1, 
X2, …, Xn), are chosen randomly from a stable process which follows a normal 
distribution N(μ,σ ).  Boyles (1991) recommended a MLE (maximum likelihood 
estimator) of C
2
pm by substituting the sample mean 
n
ii 1
x x /n== ∑  for μ and the MLE  = 2ns n 2ii 1(x x) /n=∑ − 2 for σ  in expression (3), which can be expressed as 
pmCˆ = 2 2
n
USL LSL
6 s (x T)
−
+ − = n 2
ii 1
d , (4) 
(x T) /n= −∑3
where d = (USL – LSL)/2 is half the length of the specification interval.  As noted 
by Lin and Pearn (2005), the term 2 2ns (x T)+ −
2 2
 in the denominator of expression 
(4) is the UMVUE (uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimator) of the term 
( T)σ + μ −
ˆ
 in the denominator of Cpm, it is reasonable for reliability purpose.  
Under the assumption of normality, the cdf (cumulative distribution function) of 
pm  can be expressed in terms of a mixture of the chi-square distribution and 
the standard normal distribution (Lin and Pearn, 2005): 
C
Fs(x) = 
b n/(3x)
2 2 2
0
1 U{[(b n)/(9x )] t }[ (t n) (t n)] dt− − φ + ξ + φ − ξ∫ , (5) 
for x > 0, where b = d/ , =σ ξ ( T)/μ − σ , U( )⋅  is the cdf of the chi-square 
distribution  with n – 1 degrees of freedom, and 2χ ( )φ ⋅  is the pdf of the standard 
normal distribution N(0, 1).  Taking the derivative of Fs(x) in expression (5) with 
respective to x, we obtain the exact pdf fs(x) of pm  as follows, which is a mixture 
of the chi-square distribution and the standard normal distribution. 
Cˆ
fs(x) =
b n/(3x)
2 2 2
0
u{[(b n)/(9x )] t }[ (t n) (t n)]− φ + ξ + φ − ξ∫  
2 32(b n)/(9x )dt× , (6) 
where u is the pdf of the chi-square distribution 2χ  with n – 1 degrees of 
freedom.

To obtain the pdf of pmC , we first observe that the expression in (9) is a 
continuous function of x.  Taking the derivative of F
*ˆ
Cˆ
m(x) in expression (9) with 
respective to x, we obtain the exact pdf fm(x) of pm , which is a mixture of the 
chi-square distribution and the standard normal distribution:  
*
fm(x) = 
b N/(3x)
* 2 2 2
0
u {[(b N)/(9x )] t }[ (t N) (t N)]− φ + ξ + φ − ξ∫  
2 32(b N)/(9x )dt× , (10) 
where u* is the pdf of the chi-square distribution with N – 1 degrees of freedom.   
3. Inference on the Taguchi Capability Index Cpm
3-1. Lower Confidence Bound Based on the Statistic  pmCˆ
Boyles (1991) derived an approximate 100(1 )%− α  lower confidence bound 
for Cpm based on , which is expressed as  pmCˆ
pmCˆ
2
1 ˆ(v)
vˆ
−αχ ,  (11) 
where 2 ˆ(v)α  is the 100  upper tail percentage points for the chi-square 
distribution with  degrees of freedom, 
χ α
vˆ vˆ  = 2ˆ2 ˆ(1 ) /(1 2 )+ δ + δ , and 
2
n
ˆ 2(x T) /sδ = −  is the MLE of .   δ
Subbaiah and Taam (1993) present results of a comparative Monte Carlo 
study of some approximation functions.  Lin and Pearn (2005) provided tables of 
the critical values based on  to testing process performance using the 
Taguchi capability index. 
pmCˆ
3-2. Lower Confidence Bound Based on the Statistic  *pmCˆ
Assume that the measurements of the i-th characteristic investigated, 
(Xi1, …, 
iin
), are chosen randomly from a stable process which follows a 
normal distribution 
X
2N( ,  )μ σ  for each i = 1, 2, …, m, j = 1, 2, …, ni.  For 
each subsample, let ix = ij ij 1
in x /n∑ s=  and i =2 in 2ij i ij 1(x x ) /(n 1)= − −∑  denote the sample mean and sample variance, respectively, of the i-th sample.  Given 
x = { xij; i = 1, 2, …, m, j = 1, 2, …, ni }, the likelihood function for  and μ 2σ  
can be expressed as expression (12), where N = m ii 1n=∑ .

The likelihood equations (13) and (14) produce the unique solution 
( , )=(μˆ 2σˆ x , ), where 2Ns x = im n iji 1 j 1 x /N= =∑ ∑  and =2Ns i 2m n iji 1 j 1(x x) /N= = −∑ ∑ .

3-3. Critical Values and P-values Based on  *pmCˆ
To determine whether a given process with subsamples meets the preset 
capability requirement and runs under the desired quality condition, we can 
consider the following statistical testing hypotheses: 
0 pmH : C C≤  vs. .  (20) 1 pmH : C C>
Process fails to meet the capability (quality) requirement if pm , and meets 
the capability requirement if pmC .  Some commonly used C
C ≤ C
C> pm values as 
capability requirements in most industry applications are displayed in Table 1.   
Let the test function (x)ψ  based on  with critical value C*pmCˆ 0 be defined as 
(x)ψ  = . (21)

The size of the test (x)ψ  is given by 0(C )α = sup pm pm{C , (x) : C C}β ψ ≤  
= {C, (x)}β ψ .  The test (x)ψ  rejecting the null hypothesis with significant level 
0(C )α α * 2= , the chance of incorrectly judging an incapable process as capable, implies that 0(N )(C/C )+ δ 2 *= (N, )αχ .  Therefore, the δ α -level critical value C0 is 
given by 
C0 =

where 2 *(N, )α  denotes the lower 100χ δ α th percentile point of a non-central 
chi-squared distribution with N degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter 
=*δ 2N 2( T) /μ − σ .  In practice, since *δ  is unknown, we would substitute it by its 
MLE * 2 Nˆ N
2(x T) /sδ = − . In this way, however, additional sampling error would be 
induced.

Theorem.  Let Xi1, Xi2, …, Xini be a random sample of measurements from a 
process having fourth central moment μ4 = E(X - μ)4 exists for each i = 1, 2, …, m, 
j = 1, 2, …, ni, and LSL < μ < USL, then as N =  → ∞,  ∑ =m1i in
(a)  is consistent. *pmCˆ

Corollary.  If a random sample of measurements Xi1, Xi2, …, Xini follows a normal 
distribution N(μ, σ2) for each i = 1, 2, …, m, j = 1, 2, …, ni, then C  is 
asymptotically efficient. 
4-2. An Approximate 100(1 - α)% Confidence Interval of Cpm
Lin et al. (2009) derived an approximate 100(1 – α)% lower confidence interval 
on Cpm under the normality assumption.  In this section, an approximate 
100(1 – α)% lower confidence interval on Cpm is constructed without the 
normality assumption.  We note that the asymptotic variance pm  can be 
estimated by substituting the unbiased estimators M3 and M4 of μ3 and μ4 
respectively into the numerator in , where

6. Conclusion 
Taguchi capability index has been introduced to provide quantitative 
measures on process performance.  Investigations of the estimated Taguchi 
capability index based on subsamples have been proposed and arrested 
substantial research attention.  In this report, investigation based on 
subsamples was considered for normal and near normal processes.  Inferential 
methods including P-value, critical values and a reliable inferential procedure 
based on subsamples were constructed.  The limiting distribution of the 
considered estimator was derived.  A practical example was provided to 
demonstrate how the proposed procedure may be applied for judging whether the 
process runs under the desirable quality requirement.
