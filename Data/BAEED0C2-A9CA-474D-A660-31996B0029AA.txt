Abstract 
The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been 
widely applied to the Global Positioning System (GPS) 
navigation processing and GPS/INS (inertial navigation 
system) integrated systems as the navigation state 
estimator. For obtaining optimal (in the mean square 
sense) estimate of the system state vector, the designers 
are required to have exact knowledge on both dynamic 
process and measurement models, in addition to the 
assumption that both the process and measurement are 
corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian white sequences. The 
adaptive algorithm has been one of the approaches to 
improve the estimation accuracy of the EKF when 
precise knowledge on the system models is not 
available. The first part of the report presents the basic 
properties for the adaptation and innovation parameters 
After that, four approaches for improving the 
navigation accuracy are presented: (1) innovation based 
adaptive fading Kalman filter for identifying the 
measurement noise covariance matrix; (2) fuzzy 
adaptive fading Kalman filter for GPS and GPS/INS 
Navigation; (3) application of the PSO-RBFN for 
GPS/INS navigation; (4) Unscented Kalman filter with 
nonlinear dynamic process modeling for GPS 
navigation.

一、前言 
While employed in the GPS receiver [2] and the 
GPS/INS integrated navigation systems as the 
navigational state estimator, the extended Kalman filter 
(EKF) has been one of the promising approaches. To 
obtain good estimation solutions using the EKF 
approach, the designers are required to have good 
knowledge on both dynamic process (plant dynamics, 
using an estimated internal model of the dynamics of 
the system) and measurement models, in addition to the 
assumption that both the process and measurement are 
corrupted by zero-mean white noises. The divergence 
due to modeling errors is a critical problem in Kalman 
filter applications. If the theoretical behavior of a filter 
and its actual behavior do not agree, divergence may 
occur. A conventional Kalman filter fails ensure error 
convergence due to limited knowledge of the system’s 
dynamic model and measurement noise. If the Kalman 
filter is provided with information that the process 
behaves a certain way, whereas, in fact, it behaves a 
different way, the filter will continually intend to fit an 
incorrect process signal. 
 3
proposed FAFKF scheme will be assessed and 
compared to those of conventional EKF and AFKF. 
In the fourth portion of this report, a new approach 
is presented for improving GPS/INS navigation system 
designs. Neural networks (NNs) [12] are trainable, 
dynamic systems that can estimate input-output 
functions. NNs have been applied to a wide variety of 
problems. The NN is motivated by their ability to 
approximate an unknown nonlinear input-output 
mapping through supervised training. They have been 
applied to a wide variety of problems since they are 
model-free estimator, i.e., without a mathematical 
model. Fuzzy modeling is the method of describing the 
characteristics of a system using fuzzy inference rules. 
Takagi and Sugeno proposed a fuzzy modeling 
approach to model nonlinear systems. The method has a 
distinguishing feature in that it can express complex 
nonlinear systems linguistically. However, it is difficult 
to identify the fuzzy rules and tune the membership 
functions of the fuzzy reasoning. Identification of the 
rules takes a lot of times and tuning membership 
functions of the fuzzy reasoning needs “the fuzzy 
reasoning of experts”. The method makes use of the 
radial basis function network (RBFN) (Haykin, 1994 
[12]) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
techniques (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995 [20]), 
resulting in an aiding mechanism called PSO-RBFN, 
which is employed into the navigation systems for 
real-time identification of noise covariance matrices to 
prevent divergence of the Kalman filter. PSO is 
employed to obtain suitable RBFN parameters for 
filtering out the high frequency noise; RBFN is 
employed to filter out the high frequency noise for 
estimating the noise covariance matrices of the process 
noise and measurement noise for the navigation Kalman 
filter. 
Finally, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) 
[6,11,14-19,36,40-41] with nonlinear dynamic process 
modeling for GPS navigation processing is presented. 
Many estimation problems, including the GPS 
navigation, are actually nonlinear. Although it has been 
common that additional fictitious process noise can be 
added to the system model, however, the more suitable 
cure for non convergence caused by unmodeled states is 
to correct the model. For the nonlinear estimation 
problem, alternatives for the classical model-based 
extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be employed. The 
UKF is a nonlinear distribution approximation method, 
which uses a finite number of sigma points to propagate 
the probability of state distribution through the 
nonlinear dynamics of system. The UKF exhibits 
superior performance when compared with EKF since 
the series approximations in the EKF algorithm can 
lead to poor representations of the nonlinear functions 
and probability distributions of interest. GPS navigation 
processing using the proposed approach will be 
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed 
strategy. The performance of the UKF with nonlinear 
dynamic process model will be assessed and compared 
to those of conventional EKF.

The discrete-time Kalman filter algorithm is 
summarized as follow: 
Prediction steps/time update equations: 
kkk xΦx ˆˆ 1 =−+               (1) 
 kkkkk QΦPΦP +=−+ T1            (2) 
Correction steps/measurement update equations: 
1TT ][ −−− += kkkkkkk RHPHHPK        (3) 
]ˆ[ˆˆ −− −+= kkkkkk xHzKxx          (4) 
−−= kkkk PHKIP ][            (5) 
Equations (1-2) are the time update equations of the 
algorithm from k  to step 1+k , and Equations (3-5) 
are the measurement update equations. These equations 
incorporate a measurement value into a priori 
estimation to obtain an improved a posteriori 
estimation. In the above equations, kP  is the error 
covariance matrix defined by ])ˆ)(ˆ[( TkkkkE xxxx −− , in 
which kxˆ  is an estimation of the system state vector 
kx , and the weighting matrix kK  is generally referred 
to as the Kalman gain matrix. The Kalman filter 
algorithm starts with an initial condition value, −0xˆ  and 
−
0P . When new measurement kz  becomes available 
with the progression of time, the estimation of states 
and the corresponding error covariance would follow 
recursively ad infinity. The extended Kalman filtering is 
a nonlinear version of Kalman filtering, which deals 
with the case described by the nonlinear stochastic 
differential equations: 
)(),( tt uxfx +=&             (6a) 
)(),( tt vxhz +=             (6b) 
The algorithm for the extended Kalman filtering is 
essentially similar to that of Kalman filtering, except 
that some modifications are made. Firstly, the state 
update equation becomes 
]ˆ[ˆˆ −− −+= kkkkk zzKxx            (7) 
where 
)ˆ(ˆ 11 −−
− = kkk xfx              (8a)

(三) 以新訊息為基礎之模糊自適應漸消卡爾曼濾波
器及其於 GPS 與 GPS/INS 導航之應用 
The innovation sequences have been utilized by 
the correlation and covariance-matching techniques to 
estimate the noise covariances. The basic idea behind 
the covariance-matching approach is to make the actual 
value of the covariance of the residual consistent with 
its theoretical value. From the incoming measurement 
kz  and the optimal prediction −kxˆ  obtained in the 
previous step, the innovation sequence is defined as 
−−= kkk zzυ ˆ                 (10) 
The innovation represents the additional information 
available to the filter as a consequence of the new 
observation kz . The weighted innovation, )ˆ( −− kkk zzK , 
acts as a correction to the predicted estimate −kxˆ  to 
form the estimation kxˆ . 
One of the approaches for adaptive processing is on the 
incorporation of fading factors. Xia et al. [32] proposed 
a concept of adaptive fading Kalman filter (AFKF) and 
solved the state estimation problem. In the AFKF, 
suboptimal fading factors are introduced into the 
nonlinear smoother algorithm. The idea of fading 
Kalman filtering is to apply a factor matrix to the 
predicted covariance matrix to deliberately increase the 
variance of the predicted state vector: 
k
T
kkkkk QΦPΦλP +=−+1          (11) 
where ),,( 21 mk diag λλλ K=λ . The main difference 
between different adaptive fading algorithms is on the 
calculation of scale factor kλ . One approach is to assign 
the scale factors as constants. When 1≤iλ ( mi ,,2,1 K= ), 
the filtering is in a steady state processing while 
1>iλ  , the filtering may tend to be unstable. For the 
case 1=iλ , it deteriorates to the standard Kalman filter. 
There are some drawbacks with constant factors, e.g., 
as the filtering proceeds, the precision of the filtering 
will decrease because the effects of old data tend to 
become less and less. The ideal way is to use time 
varying factors that are determined according to the 
dynamic and observation model accuracy. 
To increase the tracking capability, the 
time-varying suboptimal scaling factor is incorporated, 
for on-line tuning the covariance of the predicted state, 
which adjusts the filter gain, and accordingly the 
improved version of AFKF is developed. The optimum 
fading factor:

Nαλ           (12) 
where ][⋅tr  is the trace of matrix; 1≥α , is a scaling 
factor. Increasing α will improve tracking performance. 
Further detail of the adaptive fading loop is represented 
by a flow chart given in Fig. 6. 
The DOD parameter ξ  can be defined as the 
trace of innovation covariance matrix at present epoch 
(i.e., the window size is one) divided by the number of 
satellites employed for navigation processing: 
m
kk υυ
T

where Tmk υυυ ][ 21 L=υ , m is the number of 
measurements (number of satellites). Alternatively, the 
averaged magnitude (absolute value) of innovation at 
the present epoch can also be used: 
∑=

m
i
iυm 1
||1ζ              (14) 
Only one scalar value needs to be determined, and 
therefore the fuzzy rules can be simplified resulting in 
the decrease of computational efficiency.

The 9 rules for the FLAS is given by: 
1. If υ  is zero and 
kυCˆ  is zero then c  is large 
2. If υ  is zero and kυCˆ  is small then c  is large 
3. If υ  is zero and 
kυCˆ  is large then c  is small 
4. If υ  is small and 
kυCˆ  is zero then c  is small 
5. If υ  is small and kυCˆ  is small then c  is small 
6. If υ  is small and 
kυCˆ  is large then c  is zero 
7. If υ  is large and

8. If υ  is large and kυCˆ  is small then c  is zero 
9. If υ  is large and

As a dynamic model corrector, PSO can be utilized as 
the noise-adaptive filter to estimate the power spectrum 
density of process noise and overcome the deficiency of 
Kalman filter. The PSO-aided Kalman filter approach is 
employed for identifying the dynamics errors so as to 
aid the GPS Kalman filter and therefore reduce the 
tracking error during substantial maneuvering. Fig. 10 
shows the flow chart for the PSO-aided Kalman filter 
algorithm; flow chart of the PSO algorithm is given by 
Fig. 11.

which can be written as 
 kkTkkkTkkkkk RHΓQΓΦPΦHC ++= T)(υ     (19b) 
Defining 
kυCˆ  as the statistical sample variance 
estimate of 
kυC , matrix kυCˆ can be computed through 
averaging inside a moving estimation window of size N  
∑=

jjk N 0
T1ˆ υυCυ             (20) 
where N  is the number of samples (usually called the 
window size); 10 +−= Nkj  is the first sample inside 
the estimation window. The window size N is chosen 
empirically (a good size for the moving window may 
vary from 10 to 30) to give some statistical smoothing. 
To detect the discrepancy between 
kυCˆ and kυC , we 
define the degree of mismatch (DOM)  
kk υυ CC
ˆDOM −=            (21) 
Kalman filtering with motion detection is important in 
target tracking applications. The innovation information 
at the present epoch can be employed for timely reflect 
the change in vehicle dynamic. Selecting the degree of 
divergence (DOD) as the trace of innovation covariance 
matrix at present epoch (i.e., the window size is one), 
we have: 
)( TT kkkk tr υυυυ ==ξ             (22) 
This parameter can be utilized for detection of 
divergence/outliers or adaptation for adaptive filtering. 
Alternatively, the parameters for identifying the degree 
of change in vehicle dynamics can be determined based 
on the idea of Equations (21) and (22). If the 
discrepancy for the trace of innovation covariance 
matrix between the present (actual) and theoretical 
value is used, the DOD parameter can be of the form: 
  )(T
kkk
tr υη Cυυ −=             (23) 
The other DOD parameter commonly use as a simple 
test statistic for an occurrence of failure detection is 
based on the normalized innovation squared, defined as 
the ratio given by:

μ           (24) 
For each of the proposed approach, only one scalar 
value needs to be determined, and therefore the fuzzy 
rules can be simplified resulting in the decrease of 
computational efficiency. Scenario (d): filter model 
matches the real world; Scenario (e): filter model does 
not match the real world (too small in one of the time 
intervals); Scenario (f): filter model does not match the 
real world (too large in one of the time intervals).  
The logic of adaptation algorithm using 
covariance-matching technique is described as follows. 
When the actual covariance value 
kυCˆ is observed, if its 
value is within the range predicted by theory 
kυC and 
the difference is very near to zero, this indicates that 
both covariances match almost perfectly. If the actual 
covariance is greater than its theoretical value, the value 
of the process noise should be decreased; if the actual 
covariance is less than its theoretical value, the value of 
the process noise should be increased. The fuzzy logic  
is popular mainly due to its simplicity even thought 
some other approaches such as neural network and 
genetic algorithm may also be applicable. When the 
fuzzy logic approach based on rules of the kind: 
IF〈antecedent〉THEN〈consequent〉 
the following rules can be utilized to implement the 
idea of covariance matching: 
A. 
kυCˆ  is employed 
(1) IF〈 0ˆ ≈
kυC 〉THEN〈 kQ  is unchanged〉 (This 
indicates that 
kυCˆ is near to zero, the process noise 
statistic should be remained.) 
(2) IF〈 0ˆ >
kυC 〉THEN〈 kQ  is increased〉  (This 
indicates that kυCˆ is larger than zero, the process noise 
statistic is too small and should be increased.) 
(3) IF〈 0ˆ <kυC 〉THEN〈 kQ  is decreased〉 (This 
indicates that 
kυCˆ is less than zero, the process noise 
statistic is too large and should be decreased.) 
B. DOM  is employed 
(1) IF〈 0DOM ≈ 〉THEN〈 kQ  is unchanged〉 (This 
indicates that 
kυCˆ is about the same as kυC , the process 
noise statistic should be remained.) 
(2) IF〈 0DOM > 〉THEN〈 kQ  is decreased〉 (This 
indicates that 
kυCˆ is less than kυC , the process noise 
statistic should be decreased.) 
(3) IF〈 0DOM < 〉THEN〈 kQ  is increased〉 (This 
indicates that 
kυCˆ is larger than kυC , the process noise 
statistic should be increased.) 
C. DOD ( μ ) is employed 
Suppose that μ  is employed as the test statistic, and 
Tμ  represents the chosen threshold. The following 
fuzzy rules can be utilized: 
(1) IF〈 Tμμ ≥ 〉THEN〈 kQ  is increased〉 (There is 
a failure or maneuvering reported; the process noise 
statistic is too small and needs to be increased) 
(2) IF〈 Tμμ < 〉THEN〈 kQ  is decreased〉 (There is 
no failure or non maneuvering; the process noise 
statistic is too large and needs to be decreased) 
 Faults in dynamical systems can be detected with 
the aid of an innovation sequence of Kalman filter. The 
failure detection is based on rules of the kind

技術說明 英文：The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been widely applied to the 
Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation processing and GPS/INS 
(inertial navigation system) integrated systems. For obtaining optimal (in the 
mean square sense) estimate of the system state vector, the designers are 
required to have exact knowledge on both dynamic process and measurement 
models, in addition to the assumption that both the process and measurement 
are corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian white sequences. The adaptive 
algorithm has been one of the approaches to improve the estimation accuracy 
of the EKF when precise knowledge on the system models is not available. 
The first part of the report presents the basic properties for the adaptation and 
innovation parameters After that, four approaches for improving the 
navigation accuracy are presented: (1) innovation based adaptive fading 
Kalman filter for identifying the measurement noise covariance matrix; (2) 
fuzzy adaptive fading Kalman filter for GPS and GPS/INS Navigation; (3) 
application of the PSO-RBFN for GPS/INS navigation; (4) Unscented 
Kalman filter with nonlinear dynamic process modeling for GPS navigation.
