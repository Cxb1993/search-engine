前言 
High-power wavelength tunable lasers are desired for plenty of applications. 
Such laser systems are usually costly and complex. Recent development shows that 
periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) based laser systems are very promising for 
those applications. Therefore, there is a motivation to develop a simple, compact, 
costless, and frequency convertible PPLN laser system. 
Chen et al firstly demonstrated a low-voltage PPLN electro-optics (EO) 
Q-switch based on the loss introduced by electro-optic polarization rotation1. The 
switching voltage is on the order of 100 V. However, the system is temperature 
sensitive and requires a precise PPLN duty cycle. The temperature variation should be 
less than 0.1 oC and the accuracy of PPLN duty cycle should be within 2%. Lin et al 
successfully demonstrated a novel PPLN EO Bragg modulator as an efficient laser 
Q-switch2. In order to achieve efficient laser Q-switching based upon a PPLN Bragg 
modulator, the intra-crystal laser beam should be carefully aligned according to the 
Bragg angle. The divergence angle should also be as small as possible. Fortunately, 
these two requirements can be comfortably achieved by using precise optical 
mechanical components and designing suitable intra-cavity laser mode. The property 
of temperature in-sensitivity of a PPLN Bragg modulator also gives the possibility 
that a temperature-tuned multi-wavelength nonlinear optical system can be 
established. On the other hand, another PPLN crystal can be easily integrated into the 
laser cavity, working as a wavelength tuner. Therefore, it is possible to construct a 
compact PPLN laser system within a cubic-foot area. 
Instead of using congruent PPLN crystals, we prefer to use MgO:PPLN crystals 
in the experiment. For intra-cavity operation, it is necessary to maintain a good cavity 
mode which can be seriously affected by the strong photorefractive effect. Although 
congruent PPLN crystals are an excellent candidate for laser applications, the 
operation temperature of congruent PPLN crystals must be above 140 oC to prevent 
photorefraction3. For long-term stability and less photorefractive damage, a better 
nonlinear optical material is required. Recently, MgO:PPLN crystals have been 
investigated to show less photorefraction, better power stability and wider operation 
temperature.4 Consequently, MgO:PPLN crystals become a promising choice to 
construct a wavelength-tunable, high-average-power, narrow-linewidth laser sources 
in the infrared region. 
For reducing the spectral width of the PPLN Q-switch laser, we adopted a 
grating-mirror combination as a grazing incident configuration. It can be easily

In 2007, we successfully demonstrated a novel PPLN Bragg modulator as an 
efficient laser Q-switch12. We reported an electro-optic Bragg modulator using a 
PPLN crystal. We measured a half-wave voltage of 160 V when transmitting a 1064 
nm laser through a 14.2 mm long, 780 μm thick, 20.13 μm period PPLN crystal at the 
Bragg angle. Under a z-component electric field Ez, the refractive-index change in the 
crystal domain of a PPLN crystal is given by

where no and ne are the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices, respectively, 33r  
and 13r  are the relevant Pockels coefficients for ordinary and extraordinary incidence 
waves, respectively, and s(x) = ± 1 denotes the sign of the domain orientation of the 
PPLN crystal as a periodic function of x-axis. Since 33r  is much larger than 13r  for 
lithium niobate, the extraordinary wave is the preferred incidence wave for this PPLN 
Bragg modulator. The transmission of the PPLN Bragg modulator can be analyzed by 
the standard calculation for a common Bragg cell. 
Figure 1 shows the transmittance of a continuous-wave (CW) 1064 nm laser 
through an EO PPLN Bragg modulator at the zero-order direction as a function of 
applied voltage on the modulator. The EO PPLN Bragg modulator is a 1.42-cm-long, 
1-cm-wide, and 780-μm-thick PPLN crystal. The filled and open dots were data taken 
at 30 oC and 100 oC, respectively. The half-wave voltage is 160 V. The increased 
diffraction loss at high voltage is due to high-order scatterings of the square-wave 
grating.

By using this PPLN Bragg modulator, we demonstrated a Q-switched Nd:YVO4 
laser, producing 7.8 ns, 201 μJ pulses at a 10 kHz repetition rate when pumped by a 
19.35 W diode laser at 808 nm. Figure 3 shows the schematic of the actively 
Q-switched Nd:YVO4 laser using an EO PPLN Bragg modulator as a laser Q-switch. 
The laser cavity is formed by the surface S1 and the output coupler (OC). The Bragg 
angle θB is exaggerated for clarity. We successfully resolved the temperature issue that 
occurs in the Q-switch laser using a PPLN Pockels cell as it laser Q switch. 
Based on the PPLN Bragg modulator and the QPM nonlinear frequency 
conversion, it is a straight extension that we develop a PPLN integrated laser system 
which contains a laser Q-switch, and a tunable frequency convertor. Taking advantage 
of the temperature insensitive properties of the PPLN Bragg modulator, we can 
greatly improve the output power stability of the laser. On the other hand, while using 
a monolithic PPLN crystal which simultaneously contains a Q-switch section and a 
frequency conversion section, the temperature tuning can also achieved without 
affecting the Q-switch performance.  
Instead of using congruent PPLN crystals, we prefer to use MgO:PPLN crystals 
in the proposed project. For intra-cavity operation, it is necessary to maintain a good 
cavity mode which can be seriously affected by the strong photorefractive effect. 
Although congruent PPLN crystals are an excellent candidate for laser applications, 
the operation temperature of congruent PPLN crystals must be above 140 oC to 
prevent photorefraction. For long-term stability and less photorefractive damage, a 
better nonlinear optical material is required. Recently, MgO:PPLN crystals have been 
investigated to show less photorefraction, better power stability and wider operation 
temperature. Consequently, MgO:PPLN crystals become a promising choice to 
construct a wavelength-tunable, continuous-wave, narrow linewidth laser sources in 
the infrared region. 
As a result, we propose in this project two major configurations: 
1. MgO:PPLN Q-switch laser with Intra-cavity optical parametric generation / 
optical parametric oscillation (OPG/OPO) 
2. Narrow-line MgO:PPLN Q-switch laser with intra-cavity OPO 
研究方法 
The system is L-folded and is shown in Fig.4. The pump source was a 20 W 
diode laser at 808 nm, pigtailed by a multimode silica fiber with an 800 μm core 
diameter and a 0.18 numerical aperture. The 808 nm laser was coupled from the fiber 
output to the center of the Nd:YVO4 crystal through a set of coupling lenses with a

applications, the operation temperature of congruent PPLN crystals must be above 
140 oC to prevent photorefraction. For long-term stability and less photorefractive 
damage, a better nonlinear optical material is required. Recently, MgO:PPLN crystals 
have been investigated to show less photorefraction, better power stability and wider 
operation temperature. Consequently, MgO:PPLN crystals become a promising choice 
to construct a wavelength-tunable, continuous-wave, narrow linewidth laser sources 
in the infrared region. Therefore we choose MgO:PPLN crystal as the intracavity 
frequency convertor, which has the dimension of 50mm (L) × 5mm (W) × 1mm (H). 
The multiple grating period of the MgO:PPLN crystal is from 28.5 μm ~31.5 μm for 
producing ~ 1.5 μm OPG while pumped by 1064 nm laser radiations.

Figure 7 shows the pump power versus output energy. The threshold power of 
the PPLN intra-cavity OPG is 3 W. When the pump power was 10 W, The system 
produced 10 μJ laser pulses at 10 kHz. Under room temperature operation, the system 
worked with low energy fluctuation. By taking averaging data for 1 minute, the 
energy fluctuation ((max-min)/average) is less than 5 %. Figure 8 (a) shows a typical 
pulse shape of the PPLN Q switch laser. The pulse width (FWHM) is 8 ns. By tuning 
the temperature of the OPG PPLN, the output wavelength was tuned well with the 
predicted calculation. No significant change in the output pulse shape was found. 
When the pump power was continuously increased (>10W), we observed 
multiple pulsing phenomenon, as shown in Fig. 8 (b).The total energy of the multiple 
pulse exceeded 19 μJ when the pump power was 16 W. This is due to the extremely 
high gain inside the laser cavity and can be commonly found in various intra-cavity 
applications. For reducing the number of pulses, we can simply introduce losses to the 
laser cavity, such as slightly misaligning the cavity or using output coupling mirrors, 
instead of the high-reflection back reflectors to release the 1064 nm intra-cavity 
power.

Bragg modulator. According to our design, the 1/e-square laser radius inside the OPG PPLN crystal is 110 μm. For 
the PPLN Bragg modulator, the laser radius inside it is 170 μm and the diverging angle is 4 mrad. Clipping loss is 
also avoided under such conditions. Figure 2 shows the calculated laser radius with and without the OPG PPLN 
crystal. If the OPG PPLN crystal is removed, the intra-cavity laser mode is still stable and the laser system can be 
operated as a 1064 nm Q-switched Nd:YVO4 laser without doing any modification to the cavity.  
Although congruent PPLN crystals are an excellent candidate for laser applications, the operation temperature 
of congruent PPLN crystals must be above 140 oC to prevent photorefraction [4]. For long-term stability and less

crystal is 29.6 μm for producing ~ 1.5 μm OPG while pumped by 1064 nm laser radiations.  
According to our measurement, the normalized half-wave voltage of the PPLN Bragg modulator is 0.3 V × d 
(μm) / L (cm). This value is slightly larger than a conventional EO PPLN Pockels cell due to the deviation from the

1. Introduction 
High-power wavelength tunable lasers are desired for plenty of applications. Such laser systems are usually 
expensive and complex. Recent development shows that periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) based laser 
systems are very promising for those applications. Therefore, there is a motivation to develop a simple, compact, 
costless, and frequency convertible PPLN laser system. 
Chen et al firstly demonstrated a low-voltage PPLN Q switch based on the loss introduced by electro-optic 
polarization rotation [1]. The switching voltage is on the order of 100 V. However, the system is temperature 
sensitive and requires a precise PPLN duty cycle. Lin et al successfully demonstrated a novel PPLN Bragg 
modulator as an efficient laser Q-switch [2]. In order to achieve efficient laser Q switching based upon a PPLN 
Bragg modulator, the intra-crystal laser beam should be carefully aligned according to the Bragg angle. The 
divergence angle should also be as large as possible. Fortunately, these two requirements can be comfortably 
achieved by using precise optical mechanical components and designing suitable intra-cavity laser mode. The 
property of temperature in-sensitivity of a PPLN Bragg modulator also gives the possibility that a temperature-tuned 
multi-wavelength nonlinear optical system can be established. The other PPLN crystal can be easily integrated into 
the laser cavity, working as the wavelength tuner. 
Therefore, we designed an 808 nm pumped Nd:YVO4 laser with a PPLN Bragg modulator as the laser Q 
switch. The other PPLN crystal, serving for optical parametric generation, was put inside the laser cavity. This 
becomes a compact and tunable PPLN Q-switch laser. Excluding the pump laser, the system is within a 5 (inch) × 3 
(inch) area. 
 
2. Experiment 
The system is L-folded and is shown in Fig.1. The pump source was a 20 W diode laser at 808 nm, pigtailed by a 
multimode silica fiber with an 800 μm core diameter and a 0.18 numerical aperture. The 808 nm laser was coupled 
from the fiber output to the center of the Nd:YVO4 crystal through a set of coupling lenses with a one-to-one 
imaging ratio. 
The Nd:YVO4 crystal is a 9 mm long, a-cut 0.25 at % Nd doped YVO4 crystal with its end surfaces coated 
with anti-reflection layers at both 1064 and 808 nm. The side surfaces of the Nd:YVO4 crystal was wrapped in an 
indium foil and mounted in a water-cooled copper housing to dissipate excess heat. 
The S1 surface of the coupling lens is high-reflection coated at 1064 nm (R>99.8%) and high-transmission 
coated at 808 nm (T>90%). The concave side (S2) of the back reflector has a radius of curvature of 100 mm and is 
high-reflection coated at 1064 nm (R>99.7%) and high-reflection coated during 1400~1600nm (R>99%). Since S2 
is also highly reflective at the OPG wavelength, this becomes a double-pass configuration [3] so that the efficiency 
is also benefitted. The 45-degree flat mirror is high-reflection coated at 1064nm (R>99.7%) and anti-reflection 
coated during 1400~1600nm (T>95%).  
The double convex lens F (f=50nm) is anti-reflection coated at 1064 nm on its both surfaces. This lens not 
only ensures a good focusing condition for the OPG process and also keeps a divergence-less laser mode inside the 
In driving the PPLN Bragg modulator as the laser Q switch, we applied a 1 kHz driving voltage pulses to the 
PPLN Bragg modulator. We first biased the PPLN to -140 V and applied the +140 V, 300-ns voltage pulse to it. 
Alternately speaking, we applied a long duty-cycle and negative driving pulse to the Bragg modulator. The rise time 
of the voltage pulse is less than 10 ns. The threshold power of the PPLN intracavity OPG is 5 W. When the pump 
power was 10 W, The system produced 5 μJ laser pulses at 10 kHz. Under room temperature operation, the system 
worked with low energy fluctuation. By taking averaging data for 1 minute, the energy fluctuation 
((max-min)/average) is less than 5 %. Figure 3(a) shows a typical pulse shape of the PPLN Q switch laser. The pulse 
width (FWHM) is 8 ns. By tuning the temperature of the OPG PPLN, the output wavelength was tuned well with the 
predicted calculation. No significant change in the output pulse shape was found. 
When the pump power was continuously increased (>10W), we observed multiple pulsing phenomenon, as 
shown in Fig. 3 (b). This is due to the extremely high gain inside the laser cavity and can be commonly found in 
various intra-cavity applications. For reducing the number of pulses, we can simply introduce losses to the laser 
cavity, such as slightly misaligning the cavity or using output coupling mirrors, instead of the high-reflection back 
reflectors to release the 1064 nm intra-cavity power.

4. Conclusion and Acknowledgement 
We report a compact and tunable PPLN Q switch laser with intra-cavity OPG. 5 μJ, 8 ns, 1.5 μm laser pulses were 
produced at 10 kHz repetition rate. The novel L-folded configuration also reserves the possibility for intra-cavity 
optical parametric oscillation (OPO), which can be simply achieved by adding a 1.5 μm output coupler to the 
45-degree high reflector. It is also possible to add a grazing incident grating and a reflector to achieve a narrow-line 
system. Further studies will be performed before the conference.
