ABSTRACT 
Arsenic-associated health complications are reported worldwide. Arsenic is a 
documented toxic element in drinking water. Removing arsenic from drinking water is 
widely dependent on iron-based techniques. Although inorganic arsenic has long been known 
to be toxic to humans, little is known about the toxic effect of the interaction between arsenic 
and iron. We investigated the effect of arsenic plus iron on the liver of rats. We gave rats 
sodium arsenite, iron, or sodium arsenite plus iron. Neither the arsenic-alone nor the iron-
alone treatments altered their serum aspartate or alanine transaminase levels. However, a 
combination of non-toxic doses of arsenite and iron synergistically increased serum aspartate 
and alanine transaminase levels and lipid peroxidation in liver tissue. Therefore, we 
hypothesize that arsenic plus iron synergistically induces hepatic damage mediated through 
oxidative stress in rats. Our study indicates an important public health issue: using iron 
precipitants to remove arsenic from water may cause oxidative hepatic damage in humans.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Arsenic (As), a metalloid widely distributed in the earth’s crust at an average concentration of 
2 mg/kg (Mandal and Suzuki, 2002). Inorganic arsenic is ingested with drinking water and 
some foods (Kenyon and Hughes, 2001; Ackerman et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2005). The 
safety of drinking water is a major concern in many countries around the world. Arsenic and 
other minerals from weathered rocks and soils contaminate drinking water (Dong et al., 2009). 
Arsenic contamination of ground and surface water are two of the major environmental 
problems in the present millennium: many people are exposed to excessive amounts of 
arsenic in their drinking water (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Canceres et al., 2005). 
Epidemiological studies and clinical observations report that arsenic is associated with an 
increased incidence of human cancer of the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and urinary bladder 
(Rahman et al., 2009a). In Asian countries, and especially in Southeast Asia, more than 100 
million people ingest arsenic-contaminated drinking water (Rahman et al., 2009b). 
Iron is an essential trace element for the growth, development, and long-term survival of 
most organisms. Iron absorption and distribution are homeostatically regulated to reduce the 
risk for deficiency and overload (Anderson, 2007). Cases of acute iron toxicity are relatively 
rare and mostly related to hepatotoxicity (Tenenbein, 2001). Based on a compilation of 
biochemical, animal, and human data, links have been proposed between increased levels of 
iron in the body and an increased risk of a variety of diseases, including vascular disease, 
cancer, and certain neurological conditions (Berg et al., 2001; Siah et al., 2005). 
The risk for humans of developing an environmental-exposure-based disease is modified 
by non-environmental mitigating conditions, such as genetic factors (Arteel et al., 2008). Iron 
may be important in arsenic-associated toxicity (Modi and Flora, 2007). Using iron-based 
treatment systems to remove arsenic from drinking water has been discussed in many studies

mg/kg; i.p.); group IV rats (As+Fe), were first given sodium arsenite (10 mg/kg) and then 
iron (50 mg/kg; i.p.). After 6 h, the levels of AST and ALT in serum, and the levels of lipid 
peroxidation in liver tissue were assessed. 
2.4 Blood collection and biochemistry 
Blood from the femoral vein was collected in serum separation tubes. A blood 
biochemical analyzer (Fujifilm DRI-CHEM 3500s; Fujifilm, Kanagawa, Japan) was used to 
determine serum AST and ALT levels. 
2.5 Measuring lipid peroxidation in liver tissue 
Liver tissue was homogenized in ice-cold Tris-HCl (20 mM; pH 7.4) and then 
centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Tissue supernatant (200 µL) was analyzed for 
malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using a kit (Lipid Peroxidase Assay Kit; Calbiochem-
Novabiochem Co., Darmstadt, Germany), and then read on the spectrophotometer at 586 nm. 
2.6 Statistical analysis 
The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and then Tukey’s 
multiple comparison tests to evaluate the significance between the treatment groups. Values 
are means ± standard deviation. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. 
3. RESULTS 
3.1 Effect of sodium arsenite on liver function 
To investigate the effects of arsenic exposure on rats, we measured their serum AST and 
ALT levels. Neither AST (range: 64.83 ± 15.81-69.83 ± 16.30) nor ALT (32.00 ± 7.07-39.66 
± 5.75) were significantly above normal (Table 1). Because two rats died within 3 h after they 
had been given a 30 mg/kg dose of sodium arsenite, we lowered the treatment dose to 10 
mg/kg for the remaining experiments. 
3.2 Effect of iron treatment on liver function 
A 50 mg/kg dose of iron did not alter AST or ALT levels, but 100 and 200 mg/kg doses

liver. Thus, we hypothesize that iron augments the effect of arsenic. However, further studies 
are needed to confirm this. 
Arsenic contamination of drinking water is reported in many parts of the world. Metal 
salts have been used to remove arsenic since at least 1934. The most commonly used metal 
salts, aluminum salts such as alum, and ferric salts such as ferric chloride and ferric sulfate 
(Ratna Kumar et al., 2004), provide excellent arsenic removal. Laboratories report over 99% 
removal under optimal conditions, and residual arsenic concentrations of less than 1 μg/l 
(Cheng et al., 1994). Zero-valent iron filings can be used either in situ or ex situ to reduce 
arsenate and produce ferrous iron. However, treated water is very high in ferrous iron; 
therefore, it must undergo iron removal treatment before it is distributed and drunk (Lackovic 
et al., 2000). Although the iron concentration is less after treatment (0.2 mg/l), the removal 
process has its limitations, which results in highly unacceptable iron concentrations 
(Ramasamy et al., 2000). In the present study, we used higher doses of arsenic (10 mg/kg) 
and iron (50 mg/kg), to determine the maximum level of health complications. In addition, 
long-term exposure to low concentrations of arsenic and iron can be fatal (Arteel et al., 2008; 
Papanikolaou and Pantopoulos, 2005). However, additional studies are needed to confirm (i) 
the lowest-dose interaction and health effects of arsenic and iron, and (ii) the role of the 
metabolites of arsenic and their interaction with iron in different conditions. 
5. CONCLUSION 
Arsenic intoxication occurs in many areas because people drink well water or eat foods 
containing inorganic arsenicals (National Research Council, 1999). Therefore, environmental 
exposure to arsenic will apparently continue to be common. Arsenic is removed from 
drinking water using various technologies: anion exchange, activated alumina, reverse 
osmosis, modified coagulation, filtration, etc. (USEPA, 2001). Because many arsenic 
removal plants in arsenic contaminated areas use filtration technologies that contain iron,
