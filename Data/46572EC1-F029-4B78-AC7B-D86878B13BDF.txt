1、前言 
A carbon nanoring quasi-zero dimensional structure which could conceptually be formed by 
knitting together the two ends of a carbon nano-tube (CNT) was discovered by Liu et al. [1]. Because 
CNTs possess many promising mechanical and electronic properties, the CNT as well as carbon 
nanorings can be used in both electronic [2] and mechanical devices [3] in an electronic-mechanical 
system. In these electronic-mechanical systems, thermal effects might be an important factor which 
influences the structure stiffness [4] and structure stability [5-7]. Most importantly, the induced 
thermal deformation (or structure) will influence the electronic properties [8]. Thus, understanding of 
thermal stability is very important before nanoring or other structures [9] can provide building blocks 
for larger systems. Furthermore, it is helpful to optimize the electronic-mechanical properties to meet 
the thermal or mechanical conditions as such a system is put into operation. 
 
 
2、研究目的 
 There is substantial existing literature investigating nanoring physical properties, such as 
electronic structure [10-12], magnetic properties [13-16], optical properties [17, 18] and transport 
properties [19, 20]. Most of these studies use a static approach and do not take the thermal effect into 
account. Though this research indeed provides valuable information, the important influence of 
deformation which arises either from the thermal or mechanical loading has for the most part been 
lacking. In Liu et al.’s study [8], they clearly pointed out that there is a dramatic change in the 
electronic conductance by delocalized deformation. Furthermore, Kwon et al. [21] found the 
contraction deformation of the CNT could take place at room temperature and become severe at 
higher temperature. This conclusion also suggests thermal deformation needs to be considered to 
more accurately approach a realistic application.

4、研究方法 
In the present study, the temperature elevation process is examined by MD simulations under 
the canonical ensemble (NVT ensemble). We simulated nanorings of different radii, all constructed 
of perfect (10,10) armchair SWCNCs bent to form a ring shape. The shape change behavior and the 
energy of stable structures at different temperatures were calculated. To evaluate the temperature 
effect, all atoms of the system were assumed to be thermal control atoms at the temperatures 
simulated. The Nosè-Hoover method is adopted to ensure a constant system temperature throughout 
the temperature elevation procedure and the Velocity Verlet [29] algorithm is also employed to 
calculate the trajectories of the atoms. A time step of 0.25 fs was set for the time integration. The 
REBO II potential was employed to describe short-range bonding atomic interactions. The total 
energy of system is thus expressed as:

∗−=   (1) 
where ijr  is the distance between atoms i and j. )( ijR rV and )( ijA rV are the repulsive and attractive 
energies between atom i and atom j, respectively. ∗B is a bond order between atoms i and j. The 
REBO II potential have expanded database, which leads to a significantly better description of 
chemical and mechanical properties of hydrocarbon molecules and diamond that compare reasonably 
well to first-principle prediction. The parameters and detailed introduction of this potential can be 
found for a SWCNT using concepts developed by Brenner.  It has been demonstrated that the cutoff 
functions of the REBO II potential overestimate the force needed to break a C-C covalent bond. In 
order to prevent an overestimation of the breaking force of the C-C bond, we use a modified cut-off 
distance parameter the onset of the covalent interaction cutoff distance from 1.7 to 1.95 Å [30-33]. 
Therefore, in this present MD simulation, the C-C bond is considered as a so-called breaking bond, 
where the bond length between the C-C atoms is larger than the cut-off distance of 1.85 Å. In 
addition, long-range van der Waals interactions are included in the form of a Lennard-Jones potential 
that is only active at distances greater than the covalent bond lengths. Thus, the total potential energy 
totalE  is given by

where EvdW is the energy due to van der Waals interaction . 
     In order to construct a closed-ring armchair nanotube-based structure, we geometrically 
fold a (10,10) armchair nanotube with 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 repeat units (40 atoms, as shown at 
the inset in Fig. 1) into a nanoring. This structure is clearly not a minimum-energy configuration. 
There is an excess tension in the inner radius of the ring due to contraction of the C-C bonds, and 
there is no compensation from the outer radius where extension of the C-C bonds occurs. In order to 
find a possible minimum-energy structure of the ring configuration, we generated a perfect (10,10) 
armchair type SWCNT with different initial bond lengths, then formed a closed ring structure by

5、結果與討論 
 Fig. 2 (a) shows the final stable structures of five nanorings of different radii after energy 
minimization by the conjugate-gradient algorithm. For easier comparison, the shapes of these five 
nanorings made from carbon nanotubes of 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 repeated units are shown in 
the same figure with one common origin. The standard deviations of nanoring radii and the average 
cohesive energies for five nanorings are depicted in Fig. 2(b). The samples for the standard deviation 
are taken from the local radius calculated over 1 degree intervals from 0 to 360 degrees, a total of 
360 samples. The cases of 250 and 300 units show larger values of standard deviations, indicating the 
equilibrium structures are not close to perfect circular shapes when observed from the top view. 
Several kinked regions (hereafter “kinks”) in the shape can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 (a) for the cases 
of 250 and 300 units, resulting in the larger values of standard deviations. The carbon atoms at these 
kinks are under local distortion relative to their first neighbor atoms. The standard deviations for the 
other three cases are close to zero, indicating that the shapes of these nanorings are nearly circular in 
shape. Fig. 2(c) shows the average bond lengths of inner and outer walls of these nanorings, with the 
most stable bond length of a (10,10) carbon nanotube indicated by the dashed line at 1.42 A. The 
outer and inner walls for all nanorings are defined as the outermost and innermost C-C bond chains, 
colored in yellow and blue, respectively, in the lower left of Fig. 2(b). It can be seen the average 
bond lengths of the inner walls are shorter than that of the most stable bond length, while the average 
bond lengths of the outer walls are longer than the most stable bond length, indicating the inner and 
outer walls of all nanorings are under conditions of slight compression and tension, respectively. For 
the cases of 250 and 300 units, the structures have several kinks, which serve to produce average 
bond lengths of both the inner and outer walls that are closer to the most stable bond length than 
those of the circle-like nanorings. For the largest three cases, it is clear that both the bond lengths of 
inner and outer walls approach the bond length of a (10,10) carbon length.     
Because the shapes of nanoring structures of different radii are different at 0 K as shown in Fig. 
2(a), the structural variations during the process of temperature elevation could be very different. 
Accordingly, the energy difference of an atom between temperatures of T and zero is used to indicate 
the local structural variation. The formula for the atomic energy difference is defined as follows: 
 
 ( ) ( ) (0)i i iE T E T E∆ = −                     (3) 
 
where i, ( )iE T , and (0)iE  represent atom i of a nan-ring, the potential energy of atom i at 
temperature T, and the referenced potential energy of atom i at temperature 0 K, respectively. 
Because the variation of potential energy is sensitive both to the distance between two carbon atoms 
and the angle formed among three neighbor carbon atoms, the value of ( )iE T∆ reflects variance in 
the structural arrangement of a carbon atom with its first near neighbor carbon atoms at temperature 
T, relative to its structure at 0 K.  A larger value of ( )iE T∆ for an atom at temperature T indicates a 
significant local structural variation with change in temperature, while a small value indicates little 
change in local carbon atom structure relative to its nearest neighbor atoms, even with the change in 
8 
 
the temperature is higher than 2500 K, the distortions at the inner wall become so significant that 
they will induce distortion at the outer wall, as shown in Fig. 6 by the contrasting color lines for the 
outer wall at about 2500 K. Fig. 7 demonstrates the energy difference plot of the nanoring of 450 
units, and the energy difference variations at different temperatures are very similar to the case of 
400 units. 
For a closer inspection of the local structural variation, Figs. 8(a) to 8(f) depicts six local top 
view morphologies of a 400 units nanoring at the same 86-94 degree segment (of the nanorings’ 360) 
at temperatures of 1500, 1700, 2000, 2300, 2700, and 2900 K, respectively. At 1500 K, the kink at 
the inner wall is apparent, and the outer wall at this kink moves slightly in toward the inner wall. 
From this top view, the width at this kink becomes thinner. At 1700 K, the outer wall at the kink, 
which slightly moves toward the inner wall at 1500 K, has recovered to a position similar to the other 
parts of the outer wall, and the kink has shifted more to the left while the width of the nanoring at the 
kink has become thinner than that at 1500 K. As temperature continuously increases to 2000 K, the 
position of this kink will remain the same, but will become broader than that at 1700 K. At 2000K, 
the width becomes thicker than that at 1700 K and recovers to a width similar to that at 1500 K.  At 
2300 K and 2700 K, the kink will become broader and the width at the kink will become thinner than 
that at 2000 K. The outer wall at the kink seems more flat and has been influenced by the 
deformation of the inner wall at these high temperatures.  At 2900 K, the width of the nanoring 
continues to become thinner, but the kink becomes even narrower and sharper than at 2300 and 2700 
K. Here, an interesting deformation mechanism of the nanoring of 400 units during the process of 
temperature elevation has been found. Because the bonding strengths of carbon atoms at the outer 
wall are very similar to those of a (10,10) carbon nanotube, the local deformations of the nanoring to 
release thermal stress during the process of temperature elevation occurs firstly at the inner wall. The 
kink at the inner wall will appear at a specific temperature and the width of the nanoring at the kink 
will become continuously thinner, to finally influence the outer wall at 1500 K. However, the 
influenced part of the outer wall will recover to a stable local structure at a higher temperature, which 
causes the kink to shift. At a higher temperature, since the local deformation at the inner wall cannot 
cause the deformation of outer wall to release thermal stress, the kink will become broader in order 
to release the excess thermal stress with the rise in temperature. Finally, at temperatures higher than 
2700 K, the width becomes the thinnest and the kink becomes even narrower.                   
Finally, the comparison of thermal stability between nanorings of different radii is summarized 
in Fig. 9. The averaged atomic energy difference is used to indicate the thermal stability of nanorings 
and defined as the following formula:

where ( )iE T∆  has the same definition in equation (3), and M is the total atom number of a nanoring. 
Consequently, the averaged atomic energy difference is a normalized index to investigate the thermal

7、計畫成果自評 
The deformation mechanisms of five nanorings during an increase in temperature have been 
demonstrated. After energy minimization, the stable structures of the two smallest nanorings display 
several kinks, and the local deformation for the larger of these two nanorings will occur at a higher 
temperature than the smaller one. The deformations of inner and outer walls will take place at the 
same temperature, and remain at higher temperatures. For the largest three cases, the morphologies 
of nanorings from the top view display circular shapes at 0 K. For the case of 350 units, with a 
nanoring radius of 146 Å, the thermal deformation process is very similar to the smallest two cases, 
but the temperature at which the thermal deformation begins is higher. For the cases of 400 and 450 
units, with nanoring radii of 165 Å and 185 Å, thermal deformation will first take place at the inner 
wall of the nanoring, and then the deformation at the inner wall will finally induce the deformation of 
the outer wall at a higher temperature. Although the structures of all nanorings are under both slight 
compression and slight tension at the inner and outer walls, respectively, the local structures with an 
average bond length close to that of a (10,10) carbon nanotube can maintain their shape at a higher 
temperature.
