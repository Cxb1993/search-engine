test device and 2-D simulation considering mechanical-stress
effects and energy-balance equation [5] have been used to carry
out this brief. There are 8871 grids in the test device for the 2-D
simulation.
Due to the trench isolation, the difference in the thermal-
expansion coefficient between silicon and silicon dioxide, and
the visco-elastic effects during the thermal anneals, a me-
chanical stress develops [2]. Using the result from a process
simulator considering the hydrostatic pressure with the 2-D
device simulator, Fig. 2 shows the hydrostatic pressure and
the associated bandgap-narrowing distribution in the lateral
direction of the 40-nm PD SOI NMOS device with S/D length
of 0.17 µm based on process-simulation results [6]. As induced
by STI, the mechanical stress in terms of hydrostatic pressure
is large in the S/D region near STI and decreases away from it.
The corresponding bandgap narrowing, which is correlated to
the mechanical stress, has a dramatic impact on the kink effect
of the 40-nm PD NMOS device.
III. STI-INDUCED KINK BEHAVIORS
Fig. 3 shows ID versus VD of the 40-nm PD NMOS device
with the S/D length of 1.7 and 0.17 µm, biased with its body
floating, and based on the measured data and 2-D device
simulation results using Medici. As shown in the figure, with a
smaller S/D length of 0.17 µm, the kink-effect behavior occurs
at a larger VD as compared to the case with the S/D length of
1.7 µm. Fig. 4 shows the related output conductance versus VD
characteristics of the PD device biased at VG = 0.8 V. With the
shorter S/D length of 0.17 µm, the kink-effect behavior occurs
at a larger VD due to the higher bandgap-narrowing effect from
the larger mechanical stress.
Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows the subthreshold characteristics of
the 40-nm PD SOI NMOS device with the S/D length of 1.7 and
0.17 µm, biased at VD = 0.05 V and 0.8 V and body floating. At
VD = 0.05 V, the subthreshold curves are less steep than those
at VD = 0.8 V, since the parasitic bipolar device is not activated
yet. At VD = 0.8 V, the subthreshold slopes become steeper
due to the turn-on of the bipolar device (the subthreshold-kink

effect). With a smaller S/D length of 0.17 µm, the subthreshold
slope becomes less steep as compared to the case with the S/D
length of 1.7 µm, which implies a weaker action of the parasitic
bipolar device due to the effect of more body-source bandgap
narrowing from the STI-induced mechanical stress. The trends
predicted by the 2-D device simulation are strongly correlated
to the experimentally measured data, as shown in the figures.
IV. DISCUSSION
The higher VD at the onset of the kink-effect behavior in the
saturation region and the less steepness of the subthreshold-
kink behavior of the 40-nm PD SOI NMOS device with the
smaller S/D length of 0.17 µm could be reasoned by consider-
ing the function of the parasitic bipolar device in the thin film.

V. CONCLUSION
This brief reports the STI-induced mechanical-stress-related
kink-effect behaviors of the 40-nm PD SOI NMOS device.
As verified by the experimentally measured data and the 2-D
simulation results, the kink-effect behaviors occur at a higher
VD in the saturation region and show a less steep subthreshold
slope for the 40-nm PD device with a smaller S/D length of
0.17 µm due to the higher body-source bandgap narrowing
coming from the higher STI-induced mechanical stress.

Device Considering STI-Induced
Mechanical Stress Effect

Abstract—This letter reports the shallow-trench-isolation
(STI)-induced mechanical-stress-related breakdown behavior of
the 40-nm PD-SOI NMOS device. As verified by the experimen-
tally measured data and the 2-D simulation results, breakdown
occurs at a higher drain voltage for the device with a smaller
S/D length of 0.17 µm due to the weaker function of the parasitic
bipolar device, which is offset by the stronger impact ionization
in the post-pinchoff region coming from the bandgap narrowing
generated by the STI-induced mechanical stress.

I. INTRODUCTION
M ECHANICAL stress induced by STI may affect the per-formance of CMOS devices [1], [2]. Mechanical stress
may change work function, effective mass, carrier mobility,
and carrier lifetime [3], [4]. For nanometer PD-SOI CMOS
devices, the S/D region may be very small; the influence
of the STI-induced mechanical stress cannot be overlooked.
Recently, STI-induced mechanical stress effects on the kink
behaviors of the PD-SOI NMOS devices have been reported
[5], [6]. In this letter, STI-induced mechanical-stress-related
breakdown behavior of the 40-nm PD-SOI NMOS device is
reported. In the following sections, the STI-induced mechanical
stress is described first, followed by STI-induced breakdown,
discussion, and conclusion.
The 40-nm PD-SOI NMOS test device, with its cross section
being shown in Fig. 1, has a 70-nm thin film doped with
a p-type density of 3× 1018 cm−3 above a buried oxide of
145 nm, under a gate oxide of 1.5 nm. STI has been adopted.
The channel width of the device is 1 µm. Two cases with S/D
lengths of 1.7 and 0.17 µm, respectively, have been designed for
this letter. Experimental measurements of the test device and
2-D simulation considering mechanical stress effects [7] have
been used to carry out the study.

the lateral direction of the 40-nm PD-SOI NMOS device with
S/D lengths of 0.17 and 1.7 µm based on process simulation
results [8]. As induced by STI, for the S/D length of 0.17 µm,
the mechanical stress in terms of hydrostatic pressure is large in
the S/D region near STI and decreases as the distance becomes
farther away from it. The corresponding bandgap narrowing,
which is correlated to the mechanical stress, has a dramatic im-
pact on the breakdown behavior of the 40-nm PD-SOI NMOS
device.

Abstract. In this paper we present a new static power minimization technique 
exploiting the use of triple-threshold CMOS standard cell libraries in 90nm 
technology. Using static timing analysis, we determine the timing requirements 
of cells and place cells with low and standard threshold voltages in the critical 
paths. Cells with a high threshold voltage are placed in non-critical paths to 
minimize the static power with no overall timing degradation. From the timing 
and power analysis, we determine the optimal placement of high, standard and 
low threshold voltage cells. Using three different threshold voltages, an 
optimized triple-threshold 16-bit multiplier design featured 90% less static 
power compared to the pure low-threshold design and 54% less static power 
compared to the dual-threshold design. 
1   Introduction 
As CMOS technology advances, MOS transistor sizes continue to decrease while 
power dissipations continue to increase. As transistor sizes decrease, designers can 
lower supply voltages to reduce the power dissipation. But in order to achieve high 
speed, the threshold voltage must be reduced accordingly, which results in increased 
static power. For nanometre CMOS technology, manufacturers usually supply 
standard cell libraries built of MOS transistors with high, standard, and low threshold 
voltages (HVT, SVT, and LVT). The HVT gates (or cells) have slow switching 
speeds but dissipate low static power; the LVT gates have fast switching speeds but 
dissipate much larger static power. Using multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) 
technology, developing techniques to obtain the optimal placement of transistors with 
different threshold voltages is an active research topic. 
2   Related Work 
The total dissipated power for CMOS circuits consists of dynamic and static power. 
The static power becomes more dominant as CMOS technology progresses towards 
deep sub-micron nodes [1]. Typical attempts to minimize static power rely on the use 
of HVT transistors in non timing-critical paths and LVT transistors in paths where a

3   Comparison of Standard Cell Libraries 
For our experiments, Synopsys Design Compiler™ is used to synthesize a 16-bit 
Wallace-tree multiplier, which contains 1123 cells in total. Static timing analysis is 
performed with Synopsys PrimeTime™ to extract the longest delay paths and obtain 
the clock speed information. Design Compiler™ is used to report the circuit’s static 
power dissipation. A 16-bit Wallace tree multiplier circuit is synthesized three times: 
with the HVT library only, with the SVT library only, and with the LVT library only. 
Based on the simulation result, we determine the relative performance and static 
power dissipation of the three libraries, as shown in Table 1. 
Table 1. Performance comparison of a 16-bit Wallace-tree multiplier synthesized using HVT, 
SVT and LVT libraries 
Cell Library HVT SVT LVT

Max. Clock Speed [MHz] 294.1 384.6 476.2 
Static Power [μW] 0.75506 14.4600 270.7120 
 
The 90nm cell libraries are designed such that an HVT gate would occupy the 
same area as an SVT or LVT gate; thus all three designs have the same die area. In 
Table 1, the longest delay path corresponds directly to the clock period, and indicates 
the fastest clock speed that can be obtained with each cell library 
The multiplier synthesized with SVT cells consumes approximately 20 times 
higher static power compared to the HVT multiplier, and the LVT multiplier 
consumes 20 times higher static power compared to the SVT multiplier. It becomes 
obvious that replacing all cells from the slower library by cells from the faster library 
leads to a significant static power increase that cannot be afforded in large SOC 
designs. 
3.1   Static Power Calculations 
The static power dissipation values for all simulated circuits in this paper are obtained 
from Design Compiler™. For each cell, the 90nm standard cell library contains a 
static power value for each possible input state. Design Compiler™ calculates a cell’s 
static power by multiplying the static power value for each state by the percentage of 
the total simulation time at that state. The total static power of a circuit is then 
calculated by summing the static power of each cell in the circuit. 
3.2   HSPICE Simulation 
To verify the static power dissipation reported by Design Compiler™, we select a 2-
input XOR gate in the multiplier design with different preceding gates as shown in 
Fig. 1. The XOR gate A has the same probability to output either a 1 or 0. The

LVT cells as possible, while satisfying the timing performance specifications. The 
objective is then to place HVT cells in non timing-critical paths and SVT cells in 
timing-critical paths. LVT cells are used only if replacing HVT by SVT cells does not 
meet the target timing performance of the synthesized circuit. The proposed 
methodology involves the following steps (Fig. 2): 
1. Initial synthesis: This step synthesizes the multiplier in RTL code using the 
HVT standard cell library. 
2. Timing improvement using SVT cells: Perform timing analysis to select the 
timing-critical paths for the synthesized HVT netlist. A timing-critical path is a path 
where the total timing delay from the input to the output exceeds the specified timing 
requirement. Timing-critical paths are detected automatically in Synopsys 
PrimeTime™ after specifying the clock periods. Select the cell with the highest cost, 
where cost is defined as the number of critical paths passing through the cell; replace 
this cell with an SVT cell. Repeat the timing analysis again, and swap the highest-cost 
cell in the newly-determined critical paths with its SVT counterpart. This step is 
repeated until either the timing requirement has been met or all the highest cost cells 
in the critical paths have been replaced with SVT cells. 
3. Timing improvement using LVT cells: If the design still violates timing 
requirements and all cells in the critical paths have been replaced by SVT cells, 
perform timing analysis to select the critical paths and replace each highest-cost cell 
with its LVT counterpart. Repeat the timing analysis and cell replacement until there 
is no timing violation in the design.
