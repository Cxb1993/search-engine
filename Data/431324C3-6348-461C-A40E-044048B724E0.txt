二、英文摘要 
Temperature-dependent DC 
characteristics of an interesting 
heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) 
with an InGaAs/InGaAsP 
composite-collector (CC) structure are 
studied and demonstrated. By employing 
the intermediate bandgap InGaAsP 
material at the emitter-base and 
base-collector heterojunction, the 
electron blocking effect is effectively 
eliminated. The studied device gives 
impressed DC performances including 
small offset and saturation voltages 
without degrading the breakdown 
behaviors. The typical incremental 
current gain of 114 and maximum DC 
current gain of 118 are obtained. It is 
worthwhile to note that the desired 
current amplification over 11 decades of 
magnitude of collector current IC is 
observed in the studied device. 
Moreover, the switching or hysteresis 
phenomenon usually observed in 
InP-based devices is not seen in the 
studied device. 
三、計劃緣由與目的 
   Based on the high-speed 
performances and high current handling 
capability, heterojunction bipolar 
transistors (HBTs) have attracted 
considerable attention [1-4]. In recent 
years, remarkable advances of InP-based 
HBTs have been studied and reported 
[5-7]. The advantages of InP/InGaAs 
HBTs are mainly attributed to the high 
and a 1000 Å n+ ＝ 2 × 1018 cm-3 
In0.53Ga0.47As cap layer. The CC 
structure included a 1200 Å undoped 
In0.72Ga0.28As0.61P0.39 and a 3000 Å 
undoped In0.53Ga0.47As layer. After the 
epitaxial growth, mesa-type devices 
were formed by utilizing the 
conventional photolithography, vacuum 
evaporation, lift-off, alloying and 
selective etching techniques. AuGeNi 
alloy was used for the emitter and 
collector Ohmic contacts, and AuZn for 
the base Ohmic contact. The area of the 
emitter-base (E-B) junction is 20 × 20 
μm2. 
五、實驗結果與討論 
  The schematic cross section and 
corresponding band diagram of the 
studied InGaAs/ InGaAsP CCHBT at 
thermal equilibrium are illustrated in Fig. 
1. The calculated enlarged conduction 
band structure near the base-emitter 
(B-E) heterojunction is revealed in the 
inset of Fig. 1. As expected, the lower 
effective potential spike at the B-E 
heterojunction is found by inserting a 50 
Å In0.72Ga0.28As0.61P0.39 spacer between 
the emitter and base layers. Thus, the 
improved device performances including 
smaller offset voltage, smaller saturation 
voltage, and higher emitter injection 
efficiency can be expected. Furthermore, 
the In0.72Ga0.28As0.61P0.39 spacer can be 
used to prevent the out-diffusion effect 
of acceptor impurities at the B-E 
heterojunction [13]. 
    The typical B-C junction diode 
characteristics of the studied device at 
various temperature are shown in Fig. 2. 
In the studied device, the dominance of 
electron multiplication behavior and its 
temperature dependence depend 
significantly on the collector design [14]. 
As opposed to the positive temperature 
dependence of InGaAs [15], the slightly 
negative temperature-dependent impact 
ionization coefficients are found in 
InGaAsP material [16]. Under lower 
reverse bias region, e.g., |VCB| < 4.3 V, 
the slightly negative 
temperature-dependent impact 
ionization coefficient in InGaAsP causes 
the decrease of reverse junction current 
ICB with increasing the temperature to T 
= 350 K. However, as the temperature is 
increased further, the influence of 
InGaAs layer in the collector becomes 
pronouncedly which results in the 
increase of ICB. For |VCB| > 4.3 V, the 
ICB is dominated by the thermal 
generation and impact ionization 
contributed by the InGaAs layer. Thus, 
positive temperature-dependent I-V 
characteristics are observed. 
    Figure 3 shows the Gummel plots 
of the studied device measured at 300 
and 400 K. The base-collector voltage is 
fixed at VCB = 0 V. Clearly, the studied 
device exhibits the transistor 
amplification even the temperature is 
increased up to 400 K. Moreover, an 
important advantage of the studied 
CCHBT is the desired amplification 
among a very wide current (current 
density) operating region. Significantly, 
an available DC current gain of βF = 5 is 
obtained at an extremely low collector 
current of IC = 3 × 10-12 A or collector 
current density of JC = 7.5 × 10-9 A/cm2. 
As compared with other previous works, 
to our knowledge, the operating pA 
level of the collector current is the 
lowest value for transistor action [17, 
18]. The studied device demonstrates the 
useful DC current gain (βF > 5) over 11 
orders of magnitude of IC (10-12 A to 
10-1 A) and reaches a significant value 
of 118 at IC = 10 mA. This is mainly 
attributed to the improved emitter 
injection efficiency and high-quality 
base layer. The useful current gains at 
current density JC reaches 10-3 A/cm2, is 
7.5 V. This value is remarkably superior 
to the typical value in InGaAs-collector 
HBTs [18]. Malik et al [21] also 
reported that the InGaAs-collector HBT 
is thermally unstable, and the wider 
bandgap collector may be required for 
integrated circuit or high-power 
applications. On the other hand, Abid et 
al. illustrated that the improvements in 
breakdown performance can be attained 
by employing the InGaAsP quaternary 
collector [22]. The increase of the 
effective energy gap of the CC structure 
in this work results in the increase of 
breakdown electric field. When the 
temperature is increased, the raised 
collector current, resulted from the 
positive temperature dependence of 
impact ionization coefficient in the 
collector, causes the lower breakdown 
voltage [18]. Moreover, the studied 
device exhibits nearly unchanged 
amplification even the temperature is 
increased up to 400 K. These superior 
characteristics indicate the potentiality 
in practical circuit applications. 
For transistor action, the output 
resistance, which can be characterized 
by the Early voltage VA, is an important 
parameter. The Early voltage VA as a 
function of temperature of the studied 
device is shown in Fig. 6. Actually, the 
operating regime of InGaAs-based 
devices is adversely determined by the 
onset of impact ionization multiplication. 
In particular, at higher temperature 
ambient, the increase of output 
conductance and decrease of breakdown 
voltage result in the reduction of 
operating region. It is found that, from 
experimental result, the Early voltage 
VA of the studied CCHBT exhibits a 
decreasing trend as the temperature is 
higher than 350 K. This is due to the 
enhanced probability of the impact 
ionization process and self-heating from 
internal power dissipation. As compared 
with InGaAs-collector devices [18, 23], 
the VA value of the studied device is 
increased by a factor at least of 4. This is 
mainly attributed to the lower 
multiplication factor M-1 values resulted 
from the relatively higher effective 
energy bandgap of the studied 
InGaAs/InGaAsP CC structure. 
Figure 7 shows the typical 
common-base I-V characteristics of the 
studied device at 300 and 400 K. The 
abrupt turn-on features are observed. 
This is substantially different from the 
slower and graded turn-on behaviors 
usually seen in InP-collector HBT which 
is related to the reverse-bias diode 
characteristic at B-C junction [24]. At 
zero emitter current, the common-base 
characteristic is the B-C diode 
characteristic. Thus, from Fig. 7, it is 
known that the turn-on voltage of the 
B-C diode is increased with decreasing 
the temperature. This is consistent to the 
expected features. Moreover, the 
phenomenon of switching [24] or 
hysteresis [25, 26] in the InP-based 
devices is not observed in our studied 
device. The switching or hysteresis 
phenomenon is produced by the 
competition of tunneling through the 
barrier and thermionic emission of hot 
electrons over the collector 
hetero-barrier [25, 26]. In a 
common-base mode, the emitter acts as 
a current source and injects electrons 
into the base. Electrons diffuse across 
the base and contribute the collector 
current. Yet, if the current blocking is 
presented, the actual collector current is 
determined primarily by the C-B bias. 
The apparent absence of the switching 
behaviors suggests that the tunneling in 
the C-B junction may not be important 
of the studied device. From the
