A novel strain, Streptomyces padanus PMS-702, was employed to produce fungichromin (FC, 
a polyene macrolide antibiotic) in the shake flask cultivation. In comparing the effect of various 
carbon and nitrogen sources on PMS-702 cultivation, it was found that glucose and soybean meal 
medium yielded the highest FC within 2 days. Factors such as medium composition, cultivation 
temperatures, and initial pH were applied to optimize FC production via response surface 
methodology (RSM). The optimal cultural condition obtained is as follows: glucose 11.2 g/L, 
soybean meal 11.2 g/L, CaCO3 0.46 g/L, temperature 31.7 ºC, and an initial pH 5.5. Under this 
condition, FC production reached 112 mg/L, about a 2.86 times increase as compared to results 
under basic conditions.

Abstract 
 
For investigating the feasibility of using disperse dyes as an immunoassay 
chromogenic marker, a disperse dye was employed in analyzing antibody against 
infectious bursal disease virus (anti-IBDV). A preliminary experiment with 9 disperse 
dyes were employed in the screening test. After the screening, the DADISPERSE 
NAVY BLUE SP (DNBS) with a significant blue color conjugation to protein was 
selected. With the color intensity revealed in the disperse dye 
immunochromatographic test (DICT) strip as the objective function, the optimal 
dyeing conditions were found as follows: dye concentration absorbance (at ?max = 
587 nm) = 3, pH 7, 50oC, for 10 min. Under these conditions, the resultant 
dyed-antibody (rabbit anti-chicken) can produce an optimal color intensity reading of 
55,054 on the strip. For performing qualitative immunoassay, 105 chicken sera 
samples taken from different farms and 20 negative controls were used. The results of 
DICT strips showed very high sensitivity (98.1%) and specificity (100%) as compared 
to that analyzed by FlockChek enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (F-ELISA) kits. 
Accordingly, the DICT method developed in this study, shown to be reliable, cheap 
and simple immunoassays, is particularly suitable for point-of-need testing (PONT) in 
agricultural applications.

that of the intact IBDV virion (Caston et al., 2001). The recombinant VP2 protein, 
containing a C-terminal His6-tag (rVP2H, 458 amino acids), could be easily purified 
via the immobilized metal- ion chromatography (IMAC) (Lee et al., 2003). 
Consequently, the purified rVP2H was applied as the major antigen to detect the 
anti-IBDV antibodies. 
 
In practice, the detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in the serum samples of 
chickens usually relies on conventional techniques viz. enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Howie and Thorsen, 1981), agar gel precipitation 
(AGP) (Hirai et al., 1974), virus neutralization (VN) (Weisman and Hitchner, 1978), 
and quantitative counter- immunoelectrophoresis (Raj et al., 1994). However, the time 
consuming process, requiring special instrumentations and professional skills would 
inevitably inhibits these immunoassay techniques or detection analyses from 
benefiting the poultry farms in point-of-need testing (PONT) applications (Ahn et al., 
2003; Chandler et al., 2000; Chuang et al., 2004; Sato et al., 2004; Xiang et al., 2003).  
 
In contrast with these immunoassay methods, immunochromatographic 
technique  (ICT) provides an economic, simple and rapid approach for the 
immunoassay, which is especially suitable for a wide variety of field applications 
even without the use of instruments. Application of ICT in clinical diagnostics greatly 
shortens the turn-around time in gaining clinical test results, which benefits the 
patients by its PONT performance (Peng et al., 2007). Colloidal gold is usually 
considered to be the best candidate used to generate color signals for ICT applications. 
The only problem with colloidal gold is it having single color, which makes it 
unsuitable for the development of multi-colored test kits (Chandler et al., 2000).

2. Materials and methods  
 
2.1 Chemicals 
 
Disperse dyes (DADISPERSE NAVY BLUE SP, DADISPERSE BLACK SP-R, 
DADISPERSE BLACK SP-G, DADISPERSE BLUE SP, DADISPERSE BLUE 
SP-B, DADISPERSE GREEN SP, DADISPERSE RUBINE SP-R, DADISPERSE 
ORANGE SP, DADISPERSE YELLOW SP) were provided from DA-YU Chemical 
Co. (Taiwan, ROC). Rabbit anti-chicken IgG was purchased from Jakson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories (USA). rVP2H particles (Cheng et al., 2001) were 
expressed in High-Five cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) infected with a 
recombinant baculovirus, vP3009VP2H-5, provided by Prof. MY Wang in National 
Chung Hsing University, Taiwan ROC. A total of 118 serum samples collected from 
commercial poultry farms with their F-ELISA data available (FlockChek ELISA kit, 
IDEXX Laboratories, Inc) were provided by Prof. HK Shieh in National Animal 
Industry Foundation, Taiwan ROC. Among them, 105 samples were used for 
sensitivity and specificity testing, 13 for cross-reactivity testing. Twenty negative 
control sera were obtained from chickens reared under a specific pathogen-free (SPF) 
environment and also provided by Prof. MY Wang. Casein from bovine milk was 
purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). Human serum albumin (HSA) and goat 
anti-HSA were purchased from Sigma (USA). All the other chemicals and reagents 
were of analytical grade and obtained from local suppliers.  
 
2.2 Dye/antibody conjugation 
 
 10 
 
The dipstick was prepared by adhering nitrocellulose membrane (NC, 12?m, 
AE-98), absorption pad (Cellulose, GB0002), conjugate pad and sampling pad (glass 
filer paper, F075-17) on the supporting plastic film. All the materials mentioned 
above were purchased from Whatman, USA. A detection band located at 4.0 cm from 
the bottom of the NC strip  was prepared by drawing 0.5?l /cm of VP2H diluted with 
PBS to 2?g/?l dispensed on NC surface using a dispenser platform (XY 3000TM 
Operating, BioDot) and a dispensing system (AirJet 2000TM Dispenser, BioDot). Strip  
was cut into a size of 8cm long and 0.5 cm wide using a cutting equipment (CM 1000 
Cutter, BioDot) and then it was dried and preserved in a desiccator (DCCH 62, 
Shuter, Taiwan, ROC) until use. 
 
2.4 ICT strip analysis  
 
To optimize the DICT, dyed-antibody reagents (various ratios of dye and rabbit 
anti-chicken antibody) were used to analyze the antibody presence in chicken sera in 
order to select the most effective combinations of dye and secondary antibody. To 
analyze the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, parallel tests were used to compare 
the results of DICT with that of F-ELISA kits. Procedures for DICT experiments were 
described as follows. The dyed-antibody reagents (20? l, 3?g/ml) obtained in 
different reaction conditions were added to the conjugate pad of the VP2H strip. The 
serum sample (30?l) from chicken diluted 50X with PBS was added to the sampling 
pad and running buffer (60?l, 0.1% (w/w) Tween 20 in 10mM, pH 7.4 PBS) was 
added to the sample pad of the strip. After developing for 20 min, 50?l of running

3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Optimization of dyeing conditions 
 
In this study, the first DICT strip for chicken anti-sera detection was developed. 
A preliminary study with 9 disperse dyes (DADISPERSE NAVY BLUE SP, 
DADISPERSE BLACK SP-R, DADISPERSE BLACK SP-G, DADISPERSE BLUE 
SP, DADISPERSE BLUE SP-B, DADISPERSE GREEN SP, DADISPERSE 
RUBINE SP-R, DADISPERSE ORANGE SP, DADISPERSE YELLOW SP) was 
carried out as a screening test. After that, the disperse dye, DNBS, appeared with a 
significant blue color on test line of the ICT strip was selected for the subsequent 
experiments.  
 
3.1.1 Effect of dye concentration  
 
Various dye concentrations from A (?max) = 1 to A (?max) = 5 were used to link 
the dye, DNBS, to an antibody in the conjugation procedure to determine the optimal 
conditions for dyed-antibody reagent preparation (Snowden and Hommel, 1991). The 
detection procedure followed the method described in section 2.4, with anti-IBDV 
serum sample having a constant F-ELISA titre of about 17,000. As shown in Fig. 1 , 
the resulting dyed-antibody suspension, with dye concentration at A(?max) = 3 giving 
the highest color intensity without background staining of NC membrane (the 
background value reading was evaluated at a location 3.0 cm from the bottom of the 
NC strip), was chosen. Lower color intensities are found when the dye concentrations 
were less than at A(?max) = 3. The explanation is that at a lower dye concentration, 
 14 
reduced the color intensity on the strips. In examining conjugation time, it is found 
that high color intensities were obtained when dyeing was conducted with a longer 
incubation time as shown in Fig. 4. However, the color intensity of background on the 
NC membrane was also increased due to dye aggregation. Accordingly, the dyeing 
time of 10 min was considered to be most suitable for dyed-antibody preparation. 
 
From the above results, the optimal dyeing conditions were summarized as 
follows: dye concentration of A (?max) =3, pH 7 , 50 ºC and dyeing time of 10 min. 
Three replications under the optimal preparation condition were carried out to prove 
its reproducibility and the mean average color intensity of 55,054 with a standard 
deviation of 626.5 was obtained.  
 
3.2 Sensitivity and specificity 
 
The comparison between results of DICT strips and F-ELISA kits have shown 
relatively good agreement when testing with 105 positive chicken serum samples and 
20 negative control sera. The relative specificity and sensitity for the DICT as 
compared to F-ELISA were 98.1% and 100%, respectively (Table 1). The agreement 
quotients (? value) (Martin et al., 1987) for the DICT was 94.3%, a satisfactory 
value in comparison with DICT and F-ELISA. The anti-IBDV sera (+/?) were 
randomly selected to test with DICT strips replicately 10 times per sample and 
consistent results were obtained (data not shown), indicating high stability and 
reproducibility of the DICT strips for anti-IBDV analysis.  
 
3.3 Testing of cross-reactivity 
 16 
Although the optimal conditions might be slightly varied while using different 
disperse dyes conjugated to immuno-proteins, the feasibility of using disperse dyes in 
DICT was verified in this work. Because of the multi-colors of various disperse dyes, 
this DICT method could easily be extended to the test of multiple analytes in a single 
assay. This means the humoral response to major infectious diseases can be 
simultaneously detected via different color adsorbabilities with high concentration 
differences in one strip. In this study, the potential of applying DICT in practical 
qualitative PONT immunoassays applications  was the first time demonstrated in 
veterinary field. If there were a pen side monitor, the PONT of animal infectious 
diseases would be easily carried out at the site of the sample collection and benefit the 
farmers.

Abstract 1 
A novel dye immunochromatographic test (DICT) strip with the potential of 2 
simultaneous multi-colored tests offers the advantage of easier distinction in multiple 3 
diseases as compared to the conventional gold immunochromatographic test (ICT). To 4 
enhance the color intensity in the strip, an indirect dyeing process by coupling the 5 
reactive dye (PROCION BLUE MX-7RX, PBM) to the biomatrix of polylysine (PL) 6 
was performed. The resultant dyed conjugate (DC) was used to mark the antibody 7 
(here was anti-human albumin, antiHSA), and a dyed antibody conjugate (DAC) in 8 
structure of PBM-PL-antiHSA was prepared. A screening approach was carried out to 9 
search for the optimal reaction condition between PBM and PL to yield the highest 10 
color intensity while applying the DAC in ICT assay. It showed that under the dyeing 11 
conditions of PL molecular weight of 189.4 kDa, pH 11, 40?, and molar ratio (mole 12 
PBM/mole NH2 group in PL) 1.5., the DAC would give the highest color intensity of 13 
1.46*105 in ICT strips. Finally, this indirect dyeing process was compared to that 14 
obtained by direct dyeing process, and the color intensity could be increased 16.7 15 
times in ICT assay.  16

 43 
Practically, owing to its easy to operate, clean result without background 44 
interruption, etc., colloidal gold is the most commonly-used marker to generate color 45 
signals for ICT applications. The only problem with colloidal gold is its single color 46 
which makes it unsuitable for the development of multi-colored assays [2]. Recently, 47 
a new immunochromatographic technique using reactive dye as the marker was 48 
developed in our laboratory [7]. 49 
 50 
Although reactive dyes could be utilized directly to stain the antibodies for a 51 
designated immunoassay process, the deactivation of dyed-antibody during the dyeing 52 
process always results in a major of sensitivity and specificity loss. The 53 
antigen-antibody binding affinity may be abolished or partially abolished if the 54 
antigen binding epitopes of antibody molecule are reacted and/or sterically blocked by 55 
the dye molecules. Some literature [8-12] has mentioned the production of 56 
dyed-antibody by applying the disperse dyes. Nevertheless, this kind of dyeing label 57 
was performed just via a simple physical adsorption between dyes and antibody , 58 
which might lead to dye desorption problem during the assay. Obviously, the covalent 59 
bonds formed while using reactive dyes as the markers was much stronger than the 60

2. Materials and methods 79 
 80 
2.1 Chemicals 81 
 82 
Reactive dye PROCION BLUE MX-7RX (PBM) (Mw = 700 Da, provided 83 
from Widetex Biotech Co., Taiwan), exhibiting non-interaction with serum proteins, 84 
was selected as the model for the dichlorine triazine series reactive dye. Goat 85 
anti-HSA (Mw = 150 kDa), HSA, and poly-L-lysine (Mw = 57.9, 84, 189.4, and 86 
309.5 kDa), were purchased from Sigma (USA). Casein form bovine milk was 87 
purchased from Fluka (Switzerland). All other chemicals and reagents were of 88 
analytical grade and from local suppliers.  89 
 90 
2.2 Manufacturing PBM-PL  91 
 92 
According to the literature [7], PBM-PL were prepared via a series of procedures. 93 
A defined amount of the reactive dye PROCION BLUE MX-7RX (dissolved in 1 ml, 94 
0.5 M, pH 11.1 sodium bicarbonate buffer; SBB) was mixed with 20?l PL solution 95 
(prepared by adding 25 mg PL in 1 ml deionized water) in a reactor, and the mixture 96 
was reacred in an incubator at 42 ? for 1.5 h. After that, the non-reacted dye was 97 
separated by using a Sephadex G-25 (Pharm acia Biotech XK-26) column with 0.02M 98 
sodium hydroxide solution as mobile buffer. The DC was collected and preserved at 4 99 
? until use. 100 
 101 
 34 
(PB). The collected products were preserved at 4 oC until use. 121 
       122 
2.4 Strip manufacture 123 
 124 
The strip was prepared by adhering nitrocellulose membrane (NC, 12?m, 125 
AE-98), absorption pad (Cellulose, GB0002), conjugate pad and sampling pad (glass 126 
filer paper, F075-17) on the supporting plastic film. All the materials mentioned 127 
above were purchased from Whatman Co, USA. A detection band located at 4.0 cm 128 
from the bottom of the NC strip was constructed by drawing 0.5?l /cm of HSA 129 
diluted with PBS to 8 mg/ml using a dispenser platform (XY 3000TM Operating, 130 
BioDot, USA) and a dispensing system (AirJet 2000TM Dispenser, BioDot, USA). 131 
Strip was cut into a size of 8cm long and 0.5 cm wide using a cutting equipment  (CM 132 
1000 Cutter, BioDot, USA) and then dried and preserved in a desiccator (DCCH 62,  133 
Shuter, Taiwan, ROC) until use. 134 
 135 
2.5 ICT strip analysis 136 
 137 
The DAC (30?l, contained with 2?g anti-HSA) obtained in different reaction 138 
conditions were added in the conjugate pad of the HSA strip. Running buffer, 139 
composed of 180?l of 0.1% (w/w) Tween-20 in 10mM, pH 7.4 sodium phosphate 140

3. Results and discussion 149 
 150 
3.1 Effect  of molecular weight and molar ratio for dyeing polylysine 151 
 152 
A series of molar ratios (MR, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2) of PBM and PL (–NH2 calculated from 153 
PL) were carried out. High dyeing ratios were found when the molecular weight of PL 154 
was in the higher values as shown in Fig. 2. The possible explanation was that dye 155 
molecule was easy to couple to PL with larger MW because of the high nucleophilic 156 
activity of dichlorine triazine and amine group.  157 
 158 
3.2 Effect of molecular weight and molar ratio for PBM-PL/anti-HSA conjugation 159 
 160 
O'Shannessy et al. (1987) have reported that the labeling antibodies were usually 161 
a heterologous labeling and a decrease in the affinity of the antibody for antigen. 162 
Several authors have manipulated the conditions of labeling, primarily by varying of 163 
the ratio of antibody to label, in an attempt to minimize the effect on affinity [15]. 164 
The obtained DC was used to label the oligosaccharide moieties of anti-HSA, and the 165 
labeling approach was described in section 2.3. Using the oxidation of the 166 
 38 
reading of 1.46*105, a 16.7 times increase was observed. 185 
 186 
4. Conclusions  187 
 188 
A novel immunochromatographic technique using PBM-PL as the marker in 189 
labeling antibody was successfully developed. A series of dyeing factors such as MR 190 
and MW of PL were selected to search for the optimal conditions of DAC exhibiting 191 
the highest color intensity in ICT strip. The optimal condition was obtained as follows: 192 
MR 1.5 and MW of PL 189.4 kDa. Under this optimal reaction condition, the 193 
resultant DAC would give the highest color intensity of 1.46*105 in ICT strips. 194 
Meanwhile, this indirect dyeing approach revealed a predominant color intensity in 195 
ICT strip as compared to that obtained by direct dyeing process. 196 
 197 
This study demonstrated the feasibility of indirect dyeing approach introducing a 198 
biomatrix as a dyeing intermediate, which can be employed as the marker for DICT 199 
immunoassay. Because of the existence of reactive dyes with different colors, the 200 
DICT strip could easily be extended to the test of multiple analytes in a single assay. 201
