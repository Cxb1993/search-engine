bias condition for stress is the same as in Fig. 3.3, and for recovery Vg/Vd=0.3V/0.2V.  
The device dimension is W/L=0.16　m/0.08　m.  Each current jump is attributed to 
single trapped charge escape from high-k gate dielectric.  Only three electrons are 
trapped during stress.  The emission time of the three trapped electrons is denoted as 
τ1, τ2, and τ3.

thus concentrates on the high-k technology.  
Several issues in high-k technology are believed to possibly hinder its 
development: a) process related problems including thermal instability [1.18][1.19], 
and b) physics related fundamentals such as mobility degradation as a result of soft 
optical phonon scattering [1.20], and threshold voltage (Vt) control in the presence of 
Fermi-level pinning [1.21][1.22].  However, much effort has been devoted to 
alleviating (even eliminating) or getting around the above issues, and the results are 
encouraging.  For example, an optimized chemical composition is demonstrated to 
possibly obtain a thermally stable film [1.18].  Insertion of an interfacial SiO2 layer 
between high-k and Si substrate as well as use of “not-so-high-k” materials has been 
shown, both theoretically [1.20] and experimentally [1.16][1.23], to improve the 
carrier mobility effectively.   
Fig. 1.2 [1.15] summarizes candidate high-k materials reported in International 
Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) and Symposium on VLSI Technology from 2000 
through 2002.  Among them, Hf-based materials are most promising and their film 
chemistry [1.24][1.25], process optimization [1.23][1.26], as well as reliability 
assessment and analysis [1.27]-[1.29] are  being extensively studied.  Recently, 
HfSiON has been successfully integrated into CMOS devices as gate dielectric for 
low power applications with good reliability, comparable mobility (as SiO2), and 
greatly reduced gate leakage [1.23][1.27].   
Several reliability issues for high-k gate dielectrics have been identified: 
threshold voltage (Vt) instability [1.29]-[1.32], stress induced film degradation 
[1.33]-[1.35], and dielectric breakdown [1.28][1.34][1.36][1.37].  Shanware et al. 
found that charge trapping induced drain current degradation in HfSiON exhibits 
logarithmic time dependence [1.29].  Vt instability in high-k gate dielectric CMOS

high-k [1.35][1.40], necessitating a modified characterization technique for accurate 
and complete analysis.  The scope of this thesis thus focuses on the exploration into 
the transient phenomena.  The organization is given in the following section.   
 
1.3 Organization of the Dissertation  
The organization of this dissertation is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1.3.  A 
computer-automated measurement system is assembled to facilitate transient analysis 
and will be described in detail in Chapter 2.  With the use of the measurement 
system, experimental data during the switching delay is retrieved.  A series of 
reliability issues are identified and interpretations are made.  Proposed in Chapter 3 
is a novel technique for investigation of microscopic trap properties in advanced gate 
dielectrics involving direct measurement of single charge phenomena.  Chapter 4 
discusses the characteristics and physical mechanism for positive bias and 
temperature stress induced drain current instability (PBTI) in high-k nMOSFETs.  In 
Chapter 5, an anomalous negative bias and temperature instability (NBTI) feature in 
high-k pMOSFETs is demonstrated and the responsible origins are discussed.  
Finally in Chapter 6, the contributions of this dissertation and suggestions for future 
works are summarized.

Chapter 2 
A Fast-Transient Measurement System and Techniques 
 
2.1 Necessity of Transient Measurement 
Collection of reliable and complete information is essential for any subjects in 
scientific research.  When it comes to the study of electrical reliability in 
semiconductor CMOS and non-volatile memory (NVM) devices, one usually 
concerns the variation of certain parameters (e.g. threshold voltage shift ΔVt, drain 
current degradation ΔId, transconductance variation ΔGm, …, etc.) as a function of 
stress time for voltages and/or temperatures of interest.  As shown in Fig. 2.1(a), a 
widely-adopted methodology for evaluation of NVM endurance is to periodically 
interrupt the program/erase (P/E) operations and monitor the change in threshold 
voltage.  The parameter analyzer (e.g. Agilent 4156) is an off-the-shelf instrument 
capable of providing measurement of reliable experimental data.  However, the 
mechanical switch (e.g. Agilent 5250) used for transition from P/E operation to Vt 
measurement introduces a delay time up to seconds during switching.  Similarly in 
Fig. 2.1(b), although a mechanical switch is not required in CMOS device 
characterization, the parameter analyzer still consumes time to change from settings 
for stress to settings for measurement.  The missing information during the switching 
transient is illustrated in Fig. 2.2.  The application of a positive gate voltage (Vg), for 
programming a memory cell or for stressing a transistor, injects electrons from the 
inversion channel toward the gate dielectric.  Concomitant charge trapping into the 
dielectric traps increases device Vt as indicated in Fig. 2.2(a).  Upon relieving the 
stress/program Vg, the trapped electrons start to detrapp before the semiconductor 
 10
system.  Nonetheless, high cost of the RF kits and the effort for designing special test 
patterns hinder the method from being popular.    
 
  2.2.2 Series Resistance  
Recently, a more economical characterization method has been proposed to 
investigate Vt-instability in high-k CMOSFETs [2.3].  Shown in Fig. 2.4 is the circuit 
developed by Kerber et al.  A trapezoidal pulse is applied to the gate, and the voltage 
drop across the resistance R in series with the drain is measured to compute the drain 
current.  However, two problems arise: a) parasitic capacitance [2.4][2.5] and b) 
flexibility [2.5].  a) The drain voltage is not constant due to changing drain current 
with changing Vg.  The gate-to-drain capacitance (Cgd) and parasitic capacitance (Cp) 
need to be charged or discharged in response to varying Vg/Vd.  Cp consists of the 
drain-to-bulk capacitance (Cdb), the cable capacitance, and the input capacitance of the 
oscilloscope.  The charging/discharging current distorts the measured drain current.  
The distortion is worsened with decreasing rise/fall time of the gate pulse.  b) The 
setup lacks flexibility due to a fixed voltage at the resistor end (100mV in Fig. 2.4).  
To facilitate periodic Vt (or Id) measurement during stress or during P/E cycles, 
voltages at the gate, drain, and source need to be changeable in accordance with the 
operations1,2.  
 
                                                 
1 In most cases, voltages for stress or P/E operation are higher than those for measurement. 
For example, in NBTI experiments for pMOSFETs a typical stress condition is Vg= -2V with 
other terminals grounded, while the measurement bias is Vg swept from 0V to -1.2V and Vd= 
-0.1V.  
2 Complicated operation schemes may be required in flash memories. For example, in 
floating gate flash memories, a substrate bias is applied during programming in CHISEL 
operating scheme [2.6], or a pulse train is applied at the source in PASHEI [2.7]; in two-bit 
SONOS-type flash memories where stored charges are physically isolated in the nitride layer, 
the role of drain and source are interchanged in reverse-read scheme for NROM [2.8] or 
PHINES [2.9]. 
 12
gate (Vg,meas, usually much smaller than Vg,stress) and the drain (Vd,meas).  For example, 
to perform PBTI experiments in high-k nMOSFETs, one chooses Vg,stress=2V, 
Vd,stress=0V, Vg,meas=1.2V, and Vd,meas=0.1V.  The image of the measurement circuit is 
shown in Fig. 2.7.   
 
2.3.2 System Capability     
In addition to the parasitic delay from the cables and the probe station, the 
measurement and switching speed respectively limited by the frequency response of 
the operational amplifier and the electronic switches determine the capability of the 
system.  Without optimization of the parasitics, the system is capable of capturing 
reliable signals 50 s 　 right after stress voltages are relieved with a current resolution 
of ~5nA7.  Fig. 2.8 shows the result of post-stress Id recovery in a high-k nMOSFET.  
Electrons are injected into the high-k traps during stress, and right after the stress Vg 
is removed the trapped charges begin to escape.  Therefore Id increases.  Detailed 
physics will be discussed in Chapter 3 through Chapter 5.  As can be clearly seen 
from the figure, Id change is significantly underestimated in a conventional 
measurement method where a long delay time is present.     
In NVM characterization, in addition to retrieval of the missing transient 
information, another advantage is manifested in Fig. 2.9. Retention of a memory cell 
concerns the robustness of its Vt value against storage time.  For a memory at 
program state, less charge loss during retention gives smaller Vt drop and thus longer 
time to keep correct data.  Retention is evaluated by observing the Vt shift after 
programming charges into the memory cell.  To obtain a reliable trend (Vt vs. time) 
for 10-year extrapolation or for understanding the underlying physics, one often needs 
                                                 
7 Both the time response and the current resolution are strongly affected by the measurement 
environment, e.g. type of probe station, length and type of cables, etc.

dependence of the single charge effect, an analytical model for PBTI recovery is 
developed in Section 3.3 and high-k trap parameters are extracted.  The model is 
further verified by comparison with measured transient characteristics in a large-area 
device.  Finally in Section 3.4, applications of the technique are demonstrated.   
 
3.2 Recovery Transient Measurement 
  3.2.1 Experimental 
The devices used in this work are nMOSFETs with a poly-silicon electrode, and 
a bi-layered gate dielectric stack consisting of HfSiON (physical thickness of 2.5nm) 
and an interfacial SiO2 layer (IL, 1nm~1.4nm).  The gate width is 0.16μm ~100μm, 
and the gate length ranges from 80nm to 220nm.  Detailed fabrication process and 
device characteristics can be found in [3.8][3.9].  The devices are first subjected to a 
positive gate bias (Vg) stress, and then “recover” at a lower Vg.  In the “stress phase”, 
electrons in the inversion channel are injected and trapped into pre-existing high-k 
traps, while in the “recovery phase” the trapped charges escape via thermally assisted 
tunneling (see Section 3.3.1).  A conventional “sense-after-stress” method introduces 
a switching delay between phase transitions.  This switching delay, as has been 
reported in literature for both NBTI in SiO2 and PBTI in high-k, leads to inaccurate 
experimental results [3.1]-[3.5].  Thus, our measurement setup described in Chapter 
2 [3.2][3.5] is used to monitor the recovery Id.  The switching delay between stress 
and recovery is minimized down to μs.  The sampling rate is 104 readings per second.  
Fig. 3.1(b) depicts the waveforms applied on gate and drain during stress and recovery.  
The system was tested on MOSFETs with SiO2 as the gate dielectric and stable 
current-time characteristic was obtained as indicated in Fig. 3.2, ensuring that the 
system introduces no spurious transient effect.   
 26
current drift due to interchanging a single electron in the inversion channel with the 
dielectric traps can be approximated with qμnVd/Leff2~10-8(Amp)3, consistent with the 
measured value (for example, in Fig. 3.4, 40nA for the first current jump).  Here, 
only three electrons are trapped in the measured device during stress.  In Fig. 3.4, 
individual electron emission time τ1, τ2, and τ3 can be clearly defined.  We further 
explore the dependence of electron emission times on recovery gate voltage and 
temperature.  An average of the electron emission times is taken from ten 
measurements on the same device by repeating stress and recovery.  Fig. 3.5 shows 
the temperature dependence of τ1.  The extracted activation energy (Ea) from the 
Arrhenius plot is about 0.18eV.  Fig. 3.6 indicates the recovery gate voltage 
dependence of the first two electron emission times. Both τ1 and τ2 increase with 
recovery Vg. 
3.3 Results and Discussions 
3.3.1 Trapped Charge Emission Model 
Three possible paths for electron de-trapping are illustrated in the energy band 
diagram in Fig. 3.7: (a) thermal excitation assisted by electric field, or Frenkel-Poole 
(F-P) emission, (b) Shockley-Read-Hall like (SRH-like) thermally assisted tunneling4 
(TAT) [3.11]-[3.13] to the gate electrode, and (c) TAT to the Si substrate.  The energy 
band diagram for charge injection is drawn in Fig. 3.8.  The most probable injection 
trap energy for the selected Vg is Et~3.2-(0.54+1.3)=1.36eV.  Because the electric 
field in the high-k layer is small, this value can be approximated constant through the 
whole high-k layer.  In the F-P process, a trapped electron is thermally excited from 
the trap to the conduction band (the activation energy).  The de-trapping path (a) can 
                                                 
3 q is the element electronic charge, μn the electron mobility, and Leff the effective channel length. 
4 Tunneling by itself exhibits weak temperature dependence.  The measured activation energy (Ea= 
0.18eV) indicates that temperature plays a role, and thus TAT. 
 28
respectively.  Other variables have their usual definitions.  The FD distribution (fc) 
is a function of Vg in recovery.  A smaller recovery Vg leads to a smaller channel 
electron density, or a smaller fc, and thus a shorter electron emission time.  As the 
recovery Vg reduces below the threshold voltage, fc approaches zero and thus the 
electron emission time becomes independent of Vg, as shown in Fig. 3.6.  The 
electron nearest to the interface of the Si substrate will be the first for de-trapping.  
In order to exclude the temperature effect resulting from the FD distribution, we chose 
a small recovery Vg (≤0.3V), i.e. fc~0, in the measurement of trap activation energy Ea 
in Fig. 3.5.   
 
3.3.2 High-k Trap Density     
The high-k trap density (Nt) can be evaluated through the proposed analytical 
model.  By comparing  
 
 
 
 
, one obtains 
 
 
 
Assuming the high-k traps have a uniform distribution in space, the high-k trap 
density is readily calculated as

where C(xi) is the corresponding capacitance for trapped charges located at xi from 
high-k/IL interface, and εHK and THK are the permittivity and physical thickness of the 
high-k layer respectively.  For a large amount of trapped charges, the summation in 
Eq. (3.6) is substituted by integration written as 
 
 
 
where τ(x)=Aexp(αkx) and A=[NC(1-fc)νthσ0exp(-Ea/kT)]-1exp(αoxTox). Because 
the double exponential exp[-t/τ(x)]=exp[(-t/A)exp(-αkx)] in the integrand changes 
abruptly from 0 to 1 around x=(αk)-1ln(t/A), it can be approximated by a 
step-function: 
 
 
 
 
This approximation translates into a “clear-cut” picture: after time t, electrons with 
emission times shorter than t are completely de-trapped while all of the rest remain 
trapped.  Therefore, Eq. (3.7) is further simplified as  
 
 
 
The time window of interest for modeling is four decades as shown in Fig. 3.3.   
According to Eq. (3.3), the time span is equivalent to a physical distance of around 
10Å in high-k, or an equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of 2Å.  Therefore, the term 
THK-x is approximated as a constant, or effx , and Eq. (3.9) reduces to

has a larger slope because of a larger ΔE.  Fig. 3.11 shows the measured recovery 
transients for two stress Vg’s.  As expected, the larger stress Vg has a larger slope.  
Finally, the author would like to remark three points.  First, a very short stress 
time (0.2sec) was selected because the purpose of this technique is to characterize the 
pre-existing traps in HfSiON gate dielectric.  For a longer stress time and a larger 
stress Vg, additional high-k traps will be generated.  The PBTI stress induced high-k 
trap creation will be explored in Chapter 4.  Second, the extraction of trap density 
from small area devices or from large area ones described above is based on the 
assumptions of single energy for trapped charges and of uniform trap distribution in 
space.  These assumptions are vulnerable to selection of stress (filling) and recovery 
conditions.  One should be careful in choosing experimental conditions that validate 
the assumptions.  Third, two factors that possibly influence the accuracy in modeling 
large-area transients should be mentioned.  (a) In Eq. (3.10) a constant effx  of the 
physical thickness of the high-k layer is used which overestimates the impact of the 
trapped charges and underestimates the trap density.  (b) ΔId is determined by 
fluctuations in the number and in the mobility of the inversion charges.  Eq. (3.11) 
considers only number fluctuation (which changes Id through capacitance effect) and a 
constant Gm is used.  However, the electrostatics the trapped charges built would be 
modified upon charge detrapping which correspondingly affects Coulomb scattering 
rate, and thus the carrier mobility.  Separation of individual contributions from 
number fluctuation and mobility fluctuation necessitates Monte Carlo simulation 
which is beyond the scope of this work.

3.16(c) respectively.   
Since the channel current is stable between two consecutive current jumps, back 
diffusion of charged particles (no matter what they are) should be excluded for the 
observed NBTI recovery transient.  In addition, although the experimental activation 
energy Ea=0.5eV is close to the values for neutral H2 in literature (0.45 [3.17]), the 
measured recovery Vg dependence rules out back diffusion of neutral species.  
Therefore, the staircase-like current changes observed serve as the direct proof of hole 
charge emission during NBTI recovery which indirectly evidences that hole charges 
do play a role in degradation.  
 
3.4.2 Comparison between High-k and SiO2 
Another application of the technique is to compare the trap properties in high-k 
and in SiO2.  Discrete charge emission induced staircase-like current jumps, and the 
recovery Vg and the temperature dependence of the charge emission times are shown 
in Fig. 3.14, Fig. 3.15, and Fig. 3.16 for high-k nMOS, high-k pMOS, and SiO2 
pMOS transistors.  The activation energy Ea (extracted from the temperature 
dependence), the average τ2-to-τ1 ratio (extracted from the Vg dependence), and the 
trap density (calculated from Eq. 3.4) are summarized in Table 3.1.  Two interesting 
findings are noticed: (a) the first charge emission time (τ1 ~ tens of milli-seconds) and 
the amplitude of the current jumps (ΔId ~ tens of nA) are comparable for all three 
types of devices.  (b) The activation energy is dependent on the dielectric material 
(high-k or SiO2), not on the conduction carrier (electron or hole).  Further study is 
required to clarify the root physics of this difference.

Characteristics and Physical Mechanisms of Positive Bias 
and Temperature Stress Induced Drain Current Degradation 
in HfSiON nMOSFETs                       
 
4.1 Preface 
Unlike SiO2 CMOS where NBTI in pMOSFETs is considered to be a dominant 
reliability constraint [4.1], PBTI in high-k nMOSFETs dictates device lifetime [4.2].  
PBTI in HfSiON nMOSFETs arises from trap charging and creation in the high-k 
layer [4.3]-[4.7].  Various PBTI models have been proposed to explain the evolution 
of the Vt shift although the measured results in literature are not consistent.  For 
example, Zafar et al. found that PBTI induced Vt shift increases with stretched 
exponential dependence on stressing time and is saturated after prolonged stressing.  
In their model, they assumed high-k traps have a continuous distribution in 
cross-sections to derive the observed time dependence.  Creation of additional high-k 
traps during stressing is ignored and the Vt shift is solely due to trapping of electrons 
at pre-existing high-k traps.  On the other side, Shanware et al. showed that the Vt 
shift has log-time dependence and no saturation.  They attributed the Vt shift to 
electron tunneling into high-k traps continuously distributed in space and could 
explain the log-time dependence.  They ignored trap creation during stressing, too.  
In this chapter, we use a fast transient technique to characterize PBTI induced 
drain current degradation.  With this measurement setup, we are able to monitor the 
drain current evolution over seven decades of time (from 10-3s to 104s).  As will 
presented in Section 4.4, the drain current degradation exhibits two stages.  The first 
 56
measurement of Vt requires a sweep in Vg, thus consuming a longer measurement 
time.  The waveforms applied to the gate and drain are depicted in Fig. 4.1(b).  
Measurement phases are inserted into stress phases on a log-time base.  The 
measurement bias is Vg/Vd =1.2/0.2V and the measurement time (tmeas) is chosen to be 
50μs such that it is long enough for integrating reliable signals as well as short enough 
to avoid introducing additional stress.   
 
4.4 Results and Discussions 
4.4.1 Two-Stage Drain Current Degradation 
As shown in Fig. 4.2, the drain current degradation initially evolves relatively 
slowly.  After a certain stress time, denoted by τc in Fig. 4.2, accelerated degradation 
is observed.  The acceleration was also observed in literature (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 in 
[4.5]) where the authors attributed the imperfect log-time dependence to a 
non-uniform initial trap distribution.  The drain current degradation versus stress 
time beforeτc (“the first stage” hereafter) and after τc (“the second stage”) is plotted in 
Fig. 4.3(a) and 4.3(b) respectively.  The stress conditions are Vg=2V~2.4V, and 
T=100C.  The second stage degradation is obtained by subtracting the extrapolation 
of the first stage degradation from the measured I　 d.  Notably, the first stage I　 d 
(Fig. 4.3(a)) has a log(t) dependence while the second stage I　 d (Fig. 4.3(b)) exhibits 
a power law time-dependence with a universal power factor of 0.35 for the stress Vg 
of interest. Stress temperature effect is also characterized in Fig. 4.4 and Fig. 4.5.  
Three points are worth noting: (i) At a higher stress temperature, the Id degradation 
enters the second stage earlier, or, a smaller τc.   (ii) The first stage current 
degradation has negative stress temperature dependence, i.e., a smaller drain current 
degradation at a higher stress temperature.  Nevertheless, the second stage shows an 
 58
and/or temperature.   
 
4.4.3 High-k Trap Growth Rate  
To characterize high-k trap growth, two techniques are employed: a recovery 
transient technique [4.8][4.9], and a charge pumping (CP) technique [4.12].  The 
characterization procedures of these two techniques are shown in Fig. 4.6.  The 
devices are firstly subject to PBTI stress followed by a discharging step to empty the 
high-k traps.  The discharging step is necessary or the residual trapped charge 
generated by PBTI stress would de-trap during the recovery transient or CP 
measurement, giving rise to incorrect results.   
(i)Recovery Transient Technique 
After the discharging, a moderate Vg (=1.2V) is applied for 0.2s to fill high-k traps 
with electrons and the drain current is measured at Vg/Vd=0.25V/0.1V immediately 
after filling1.  A recovery Vg as low as around Vt is selected to magnify the effect of 
the trapped charges on the channel conductance (thus on Id).  To make the 
around-threshold Id accurately collectable in a short integration time, a device with a 
very large width-to-length-ratio (W/L=100μm/0.08μm) is chosen. Fig. 4.7 is the 
temporal evolution of the actual Id.  The transimpedance gain needed to make this 
current level (~μA) differentiable from the background noise should be larger than 
~10mV(resolution of the digital oscilloscope)/ 1μA=104(Ω).  The feedback resistor 
in our circuit is 100KΩ.  For a measurement time of 10-4s, the voltage gain of the 
operational amplifier is about 105, which is sufficient to meet well the virtual ground 
condition of the circuit.  For μA currents, the measurement system can respond 
reliably with 10-4s, and the slope for the two curves in Fig. 4.7 can be confidently

phases in Chapter 3.

stress time, but in the recovery measurement (Fig. 4.8) Id was measured at a specific 
stress time and Gm is a constant in the measurement period.  Measured 　Id and 
measured Gm are used to extract 　Vt, and thus the corresponding trap density.  For 
another stress time, I　 d and Gm measurements were repeated to obtain a new high-k 
trap density.  The stress induced Gm variation is already considered in the calculation 
of trap density.  In Eq. (4.2), the slope of the I　 d-log(t) plot is linearly proportional 
to the high-k trap density.  Therefore, we can extract the high-k trap density from the 
recovery slope and the result is shown in Fig. 4.11.  Our result shows that the high-k 
trap density in the first stage (τc ~ tens of seconds) is dominated by pre-existing traps.  
The high-k trap density, however, increases drastically in the second stage.  
Moreover, as reported in literatures [4.6][4.8] and summarized in Chapter 3, 
individual electron detrapping from the high-k dielectric can be observed directly in a 
small area device, which is manifested by a discrete evolution of the recovery drain 
current rather than a continuous log(t) increase with time.  Fig. 4.12 compares the 
pre-stress and post-stress recovery drain current evolutions in a small area device 
(W=0.16μm, L=0.08μm).  Each current jump in the current evolution accounts for a 
single charge detrapping.  Apparently, the post-stress device has more current jumps 
in the same measurement period than the pre-stress device (from 1 jump in a fresh 
device to 5 jumps after 100s stress).  This result, again, provides evidence of high-k 
trap generation during PBTI stress.   
 
(ii) Charge Pumping Technique 
A two-frequency CP method is also used to characterize high-k trap generation 
[4.12].  The experimental procedure is described in Fig. 4.6(b).  The PBTI stress 
condition is identical to that used in the recovery transient technique Fig. 4.6(a).  The 
 62
the two methods follows the same power law time-dependence with an exponent of 
~0.33, which is close to that in Fig. 4.3(b). 
 
4.4.4 The Impact of Processing 
Appropriate nitrogen incorporation into Hf-silicate can substantially improve the 
gate dielectric electrical reliability [4.2].  To evaluate the nitrogen effect on HfSiON 
nMOSFET degradation, two devices “optimal” vs. “control”, which have different 
nitrogen profiles in the HfSiON gate dielectric, are compared.  The high-k film in the 
“optimal” sample remains in amorphous while that in the “control” becomes 
crystallized after 1100C annealing of source/drain dopant activation [4.2].  The PBTI 
and hot-carrier lifetime and the Weibull plot of time-to-breakdown are improved as 
indicated respectively in Fig. 4.15, Fig. 4.16, and Fig. 4.17 with other parameters, 
such as Vt and gate leakage current, not adversely affected.  High-k bulk trap 
generation is suppressed in the “optimal” samples.  Detailed comparisons and 
discussions can be found in [4.2].  The two devices have almost identical Id-Vg 
characteristic, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4.18.  After PBTI stress, the normalized 
trap density from the CP method for these two samples is shown in Fig. 4.18.  A 
large trap density difference between high-frequency and low-frequency CP 
measurement in the control sample suggests considerable high-k trap creation during 
stress.  On the other side, the optimal device shows better robustness against high-k 
trap generation.  Correspondingly, Fig. 4.19 shows the drain current degradation 
versus stress time in the two samples.  Again, the optimal device shows smaller 
degradation.  We also evaluate the stress temperature effect in the optimal sample 
(Fig. 4.20).  An opposite temperature dependence between the first stage and the 
second stage is still observed.  The cross-over time in the sample is about 104 s,

Negative Bias Temperature Instability in High-k pMOSFETs            
 
5.1 Preface 
Compared to their n-type counterparts, limited works have focused on the 
physics of negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in high-k pMOSFETs 
[5.1]-[5.3].  The model Zafar et al. proposed [5.1] attributes the creation of positive 
oxide charges to de-passivation of Si/SiO2 interface.  As Si-H bonds break, hydrogen 
diffuses away and reacts with the oxide, creating positive charges in the interface and 
in the oxide.  In [5.2][5.3], on the other hand, Houssa et al. presented the impact of 
forming gas annealing conditions and of Hf content on NBTI.  According to their 
study, the responsible defects are hydrogen-induced overcoordinated oxygen centers 
induced by the transport and trapping of H+ in the gate stack.  However, in both 
works a conventional stress-and-sense method is used.  De-trapping effect during the 
switching delay between stress and sense has been demonstrated to be significant in 
previous chapters and in [5.4]-[5.6].  Thus to investigate the NBTI, the transient 
measurement technique introduced in Chapter 2 is used in this chapter.  An 
anomalous stress induced drain current (Id) enhancement is observed and the effects 
of stress gate voltage, stress temperature, and stress duration are introduced in Section 
5.3. The responsible physical mechanism – a bipolar charging model is proposed in 
Section 5.4.  Two characterization techniques, charge pumping (CP) and single 
charge emission, are performed in Section 5.5 to justify the model.  Section 5.6 
discusses the impact of high-k film integrity on the anomalous behavior followed by a 
summary in Section 5.7.   
 86
prolonged stress times, a turn-around behavior is noticed, and the polarity of ΔId,lin 
changes from positive (enhancement) to negative (degradation).  Fig. 5.5 and Fig. 
5.6 summarize the effects of stress Vg, temperature, and stress duration. Shown in Fig. 
5.5, for t=0.1s, low |Vg’s| (-1.4V~-2V) induce Id degradation which worsens as |Vg| 
increases.  As |Vg| further increases, |ΔId| turns around and the polarity becomes 
positive, or enhancement.  This trend remains for t=10s, but the turn-around |Vg| is 
slightly larger.  Interestingly for 1000s, the |ΔId| trend evolves to that as in SiO2, i.e. 
a higher |Vg| monotonically induces worse degradation.  Moreover, for short stress 
periods, |ΔId| changes from negative for low T to positive for high T, as indicated in 
Fig. 5.6.   For long stress periods, the trend, again, evolves to that as expected, or a 
higher T monotonically results in worse degradation.  One point worth mentioning is 
that the Id enhancement is observed mainly for t<10s.  If the transient de-trapping 
effect cannot be avoided (as in a conventional method), there is a possibility that one 
fails to observe the abnormal phenomena.   
 
5.4 The Bipolar Charging Model 
Under a negative Vg stress, three possible factors lead to Id instability2: (i) 
trapping of the valence electrons from the poly-gate into high-k traps (ΔId>0); (ii) 
trapping of the holes from the inversion channel into high-k traps (ΔId<0), and (iii) 
interfacial SiO2 layer (IL) degradation and concomitant positive oxide charge (holes 
and/or hydrogen-related species) buildup (ΔId<0).  Fig. 5.7(a) depicts the energy 
band diagram at equilibrium.  Trap sites whose energy depths (Et) are below the 
                                                 
2 Both charge trapping in the gate stack and the interface degradation may give rise to drain 
current instability.  Factors (i) and (ii) are effective through the former which changes the 
device threshold voltage, and factor (iii) through the latter which degrades carrier mobility. 
Additional trap creation in high-k layer enhances factors (i) and (ii) and is discussed in the 
next section.

generation of additional (interface and high-k bulk) traps in the next two sections.   
 
5.5 Charge Pumping and Single Charge Emission 
In previous chapters, direct measurement of single charge emission from 
dielectric traps have been reported in high-k nMOSFETs [5.4][5.9] as well as in SiO2 
pMOSFETs [5.10].  Fig. 5.8 shows the patterns of recovery drain current for low 
(-1.5V) and high (-2.2V) stress Vg which reveal charge species injected during stress.   
The measurement setup and experimental waveforms are identical with the one in Fig. 
3.1.  The recovery condition is Vg around the device threshold voltage to magnify 
the impact of single charge on drain current6.  An upward jump in Id (increase in |Id|) 
corresponds to a single hole escape, and a downward shift (decrease in |Id|) to a single 
electron.  As can be clearly seen in Fig. 5.8(a), only holes are trapped during a low 
|Vg| stress, while both electrons and holes during a high |Vg| stress are introduced into 
the trap states as indicated in Fig. 5.8(b).  Direct observation of both electron and 
hole charges confirms the bipolar charging model proposed in Section 5.4. 
In addition to single charge emission, charge pumping measurements are 
performed.  The waveforms and corresponding values of CP parameters are given in 
Fig. 5.9.  A two-frequency CP method is used to discriminate between high-k traps 
and interface traps7.  The high frequency (1MHz in this experiment) results monitor 
interface traps.  The difference between low frequency (5kHz) and high frequency is 
taken to monitor high-k bulk traps which, compared to the interface traps, are slow in 
response to high frequency pulses.  Fig. 5.10(a) and Fig. 5.10(b) demonstrate CP 
results respectively for exploration of stress voltage effect and for the impact of gate 
stack integrity.   As compared in Fig. 5.10(a), a low stress Vg (-1.5V) creates neither 
                                                 
6 The details of the single charge emission measurement are described in Chapter 3. 
7 The two-frequency CP technique is described in detail in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. 
 90
of stress Vg and temperature in this chapter, the anomalous turn-around behavior takes 
place within ~10s; thereafter returns to monotonic degradation as in SiO2.  A 
conventional stress-and-sense characterization method may fail to capture this feature 
because of the switching delay lasting for seconds.  A bipolar charging model along 
with trap generation is proposed to account for the experimental results as 
summarized in Table 5.1.  Electron trapping is found to be predominant, leading to Id 
enhancement for short term and/or a high |Vg| stress.  As the stress evolves with time, 
hole trapping/IL degradation eventually take over.  For a low |Vg| stress, hole 
trapping/IL degradation dictates throughout whole stress period.  Even under an 
identical stress condition, the polarity of I　 d in an optimized (ΔId>0, Id enhancement) 
and in a non-optimized (ΔId<0, Id degradation) high-k film may opposite as a result of 
additional trap generation.  Dependence of the dominant mechanism on high-k 
integrity and stress conditions necessitates further study for extrapolating device 
lifetime with a correct methodology.

for a low |Vg| (-1.5V) (a), and for a high |Vg| (-2.2V). Discontinuous 
current changes represent charge escape from dielectric traps, revealing 
the charge species injected during stress. An upward jump corresponds 
to a single hole charge, and a downward shift to a single electron. For 
the low |Vg| case, only two holes are trapped during stress, while for 
the high |Vg| case both electrons and holes are introduced into 
dielectric traps during stress.

Conclusions 
A computer-automated transient measurement system with a switching time 
down to microseconds is developed in this work.  With the use of the system, a novel 
single charge emission technique involving direct measurement of single charge 
emission for characterization of microscopic trap properties is demonstrated.  The 
activation energy for charge emission is extracted from experiments, and is found to 
be dependent on the gate dielectric material (high-k or SiO2), not on the de-trapped 
charges (electrons or holes).  Trap density can also be evaluated simply by 
measuring the ratio of the first two charge emission times in small-area devices or by 
extracting the slope of recovery drain transient in large-are devices.   
Furthermore, interesting bias and temperature instabilities in high-k nMOSFETs 
(PBTI) and in high-k pMOSFETs (NBTI) easily ignored in conventional 
characterization methods are observed.  On the one hand, PBTI induced drain 
current degradation in nMOSFETs is found to have a two-stage feature.  The first 
stage is dominated by initial trap filling featuring a logarithmic time evolution and 
negative temperature dependence, while the second stage is dictated by additional trap 
creation exhibiting a power law time relation and positive temperature dependence.  
On the other hand, an anomalous turn-around drain current instability is measured in 
high-k pMOSFETs.  The initial increase in drain current stems from valence band 
electron trapping from the poly-gate into the high-k traps.  At prolonged stressing, 
hole charging and interfacial layer degradation take over and the polarity of drain 
current change becomes opposite.
