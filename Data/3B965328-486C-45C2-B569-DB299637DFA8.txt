Introduction and Literature review 
High-speed transit systems often pass close to buildings and structures, causing noise, vibration, 
and electromagnetic waves, which become more serious as the train accelerates. Especially, when a 
hospital or high-tech factory is adjacent to the railroad, a small vibration transmitted from the 
moving vehicles may adversely influence surgical operations or high-tech production processes. 
Additionally, large vibration also makes uncomfortable for human. Thus, how to realize the 
behavior of building vibration induced by the high-speed train is more and more important. 
 
Before the analyzing above problem, we need to know that how to establish the moving vehicle 
model. During the past several years, multi-axle vehicle and vehicle-bridge finite element models 
have been proposed continuously. Lin and Trethewey [1] presented finite element formulations for 
beams subjected to the arbitrary movement of a spring-mass-damper system. Huang and Wang [2] 
studied the impact analysis of cable-stayed bridge due to a vehicle moving across bridge using a 
nonlinear model with seven degrees of freedom (DOF). Wang et al. [3] investigated the variation of 
dynamic loading of girder bridges due to several vehicles moving across bridge. The vehicle is 
simulated as a nonlinear vehicle model with 11-DOF. Fafard et al. [4] developed a five-axle vehicle 
model to study the dynamic interactions between the moving mass and the bridge structural 
components. Tan et al. [5] developed three-dimensional (3D) vehicle model has 7-DOF and 
analyzed the bridge-vehicle interaction problem. Henchi et al. [6] presented a 3D vehicle model 
with 7-DOF for the solution of the dynamic interaction problem between the bridge and vehicle. 
Huang et al. [7] developed a procedure for obtaining the dynamic response of thin-walled curve box 
girder bridges due to truck loading. The truck simulated as a nonlinear vehicle model with 11-DOF. 
Li and Su [8] researched the resonant vibration for a simply supported bridge under high-speed 
trains using a model of a rigid body and four wheel-axle sets. Xia et al. [9] adopted a 4-axle 
(27-DOF) vehicle model in the dynamic analysis of long suspension bridge. Au et al. [10] used five 
models of moving vehicle to study on the impact effects on a cable-stayed bridge under railway 
train loading. Zhang et al. [11] developed the space model for dynamic analysis of bridge-train 
interaction and the train can be with one carriage or any amount of carriages. Liu et al. [12] studied 
the impact behavior of a multi-girder concrete bridge under multiple moving vehicles and presented 
a 3D nonlinear vehicle model with 11-DOF. Zhu and Law [13] investigated the dynamic loading on 
a multi-lane continuous bridge due to vehicles moving on top of the bridge deck. The analytical 
vehicle is simulated as a two-axle 3D vehicle model with 7-DOF. Song et al. [14] proposed a 
high-speed train model with 38-DOF for the 3D finite element analysis of high-speed train-bridge 
 1
train-induced ground vibrations at a site. Auersch [31] presented an integrated model to compute 
vehicle-track interaction and the ground vibrations of passing trains, and the theoretical methods and 
results have been proven by field experiments. Xia and Zhang [32] established a computational 
model of the dynamic interaction between high-speed trains and bridges. In their study, the proposed 
analysis model and the solution method were verified by comparing the calculated results and the 
data measured in situ. 
 
High-tech industries have a very severe construction requirement for vibration. However, trains 
or vehicles that move nearby the high-tech factory or even the frequent small earthquakes will bring 
abundant vibrations which decrease the high-tech product qualification. Thus, how to isolate the 
micro-vibration induced by nearby vehicles or small earthquakes has become a significant issue. In 
the literature, most studies concerning wave isolation were focused on the decrease of structure 
response using open or in-filled trenches and a row of piles [33-38]. Investigating the vibration 
reduction due to foundation slab, most researchers concentrated on the vibration of earthquakes for 
the in-plane vibration of a mat foundation. Wong and Luco [39] presented an approximate 
numerical procedure for calculation of the harmonic force-displacement relationships for a rigid 
foundation of arbitrary shape placed on an elastic half-space. Wong and Luco [40] researched the 
harmonic response of a rigid massless rectangular foundation bonded to elastic half-space and 
subjected to the action of both external forces and obliquely incident plane seismic waves. Bycroft 
[41] developed a general method of determining the motion of a large rigid mat foundation 
subjected to travelling surface waves. Luco and Wong [42 presented a method to obtain the response 
of a rigid foundation bonded to a visco-elastic half-space when subjected to a spatially varying 
ground motion including both random and deterministic effects. Pais and Kausel [43] used 
approximate procedures to evaluate the influence of kinematic interaction for structure with rigid 
foundations subjected simultaneously to several obliquely incident SH-waves. Veletsos et al. [44] 
presented closed-form expression and comprehensive numerical solution for the transfer functions 
of the rigid rectangular foundations excited by incoherent shear waves. In their study, the transfer 
function for the torsional component of foundation motion is sensitive to the foundation side-length 
ratio. Kim and Stewart [45] studied the effects of inertial interaction on foundation motions, and by 
reviewing analytical models for the kinematic interaction effects associated with base-slab 
averaging and soil-pile interaction.

freedom in the local z direction and the rotation degree of freedom in the local y direction. The 
translation degree of freedom can also be set into the x (or y) direction, and then, the rotation degree 
of freedom is in the z (or -z) direction. The element includes a wheel node and a number of target 
nodes. The current wheel position equals the initial wheel position plus the duration time 
multiplying the train speed. Because the coordinates of all the target nodes and the wheel node are 
known, the two target nodes where the wheel node is located between them can be found. If the two 
target nodes and the wheel node are nodes 1,3 and 2 respectively, the stiffness of this 3-node 
element for the nodal displacements (X1, 1θ , X2, X3, 3θ ) is

The load F including all the trainload on the wheel is equilibrium on the system, so this load F

The above five-degrees-of-freedom wheel element can be used with the beam or beam with the 
elastic foundation element. The advantage is that the element only contains stiffness kr, so the 
stiffness matrix is symmetry. If the element contains a larger damping for very fast motion, the 
unsymmetrical stiffness matrix must be used. The reason is because the velocity field of node 2′

As the result of transformation, the approximate solution of this problem is given in reference 
[47], we can express the problem by a set of six equations that successively describe the rotation and 
vertical motion of the sprung mass, the vertical motions of unsprung masses and the bending 
vibration of beams.

The problem specified by the set of the second order ordinary differential equations in 
Equation (1.25) to (1.27) with the initial conditions was solved by the Newmark method. The bridge 
length is 25 m with the input data as shown in Table 1. The vehicle is modeled by two wheel 
elements, two spring-damper elements and a lumped mass. The master node is located at the center 
of the lumped mass, and the upper nodes of the two spring-damper elements are slaved nodes 
controlled by this master node. The next five sections compare the analytic and finite element 
solutions due to the change of the wheel distance, the vehicle speed, the number of beam elements, 
the time step length and the road irregularity. In the finite element analysis, the two Newmark 
constants were set to 0.25 and 0.5, and the consistent mass scheme was used. Without special 
explanation in Sections 1.2.2 to 1.2.6, the parameters of finite element analyses are the wheel 
distance (D) of 14 m, the vehicle speed of 30 m/s, 20 beam elements to model the simply supported 
beam, the time step length of 0.001 s and no road irregularity. 
 
1.2.2. Variation of the wheel distance 
The wheel distance (D) was set to 14 m and 1 m for two finite element analyses. Figure 1.5 
shows the comparison of the displacements on beam and mass centers using Fryba’s [47] and finite 
element solutions. Since the dashed and solid lines are overlapped, this figure indicates that the two 
solutions are almost identical.

1.2.4. Variation of the number of beam elements 
This section investigates the analysis accuracy due to the number of beam elements to model a 
simply supported beam. Both linear (Equation (1.7)) and cubic (Equation (1.3)) interpolation 
functions of the wheel element were studied. The comparisons between analytic and finite element 
solutions are shown in Figure 1.7. This figure indicates a good agreement for the cubic-form wheel 
element, even when only two elements are used to model a simple beam. For the linear-form 
element, a simple beam should be divided into 6 elements to obtain acceptable result.

step lengths. This figure indicates that dtV/L smaller than 0.006 is suitable to obtain an accurate 
finite element analysis, where dt is the time step length, V is the vehicle speed and L is the length of 
a simply supported beam. This means that about 200 time steps are accurate enough to simulate a 
vehicle passing a bridge using the current finite element scheme. This time step length is reasonable, 
and it is usually much smaller than this value when one performs an analysis of a vehicle moving on 
a bridge.

1.3. Comparison of finite element and experimental results 
Because the theoretical solution of vibrations is absent for complicated vehicle models, this 
section compares vibrations induced by moving trains passing multi-simply supported bridges 
between finite element and experimental solutions. The following sub-sections explain the 
train-bridge system, finite element model and comparison result. 
 
1.3.1. Illustration of bridge system 
A 3D semi-infinite soil profile ( 0z- ,y- ,x ≤≤∞∞≤≤∞∞<<∞− ) contains a continuous 
 17
The Young's modulus of bridge beams is 3.02×107 kN/m2, of bridge piers is 2.7×107 kN/m2 and 
of foundation caps and piles is 2.5×107kN/m2.  The Poisson's ratio and mass density of all the 
bridge are 0.15 and 2.4 T/m3, respectively. The two factors of Rayleigh damping ([Damping]=?
[Mass]+?[Stiffness])?and?for the soil and bridge equal 0.75/s and 3.7×10-4s, respectively, which 
provides approximately 2% damping ratio between frequencies of 3 and 10 Hz. The Young's 
Modulus of the surface soil is 7.5×104 kN/m2 and more than 52 m under the ground is 8×105 kN/m2. 
The linear interpolation was applied to determine the Young's modulus between these two depths. 
The mass density and Poisson’s ratio of the soil are 2 T/m3 and 0.49, respectively.  
 
1.3.2. Finite element model 
The Newmark direct integration method (Newmark constants of 0.25 and 0.5) with the 
consistent mass scheme was used to solve this problem. The solution scheme was the SSOR 
preconditioned conjugated gradient method [46]. The finite element model was 675 m long, 423.75 
m wide and 104 m deep with the maximum square element size of 3.75 m as shown in Figure 1.11, 
in which the soil and bridge foundation are modeled by 8-node 3D solid element, the superstructure 
of the bridge is modeled by 2-node 3D beam element and the five surfaces except the top surface of 
the mesh are modeled by the absorbing boundary condition [48]. Figure 1.12 shows the finite 
element mesh of the bridge and pile foundation. Within the area of 3 m by 3 m on the center of the 
pile cap surface, a master-slaved node scheme [46] was used to model the connection between the 
pile cap (3D solid element) and the bridge column (3D beam element). The master node was 
arranged at the foundation cap center, and other nodes within this 3 m by 3 m area were set to slaved 
nodes, whose three degrees of freedom are dominated by the 6-degree-of-freedom master node.

Figures 1.14 and 1.15 show the velocity decibel of measurements and finite element results at 
the distance from the bridge pier center of 3 and 100 m, in which the measurements of solid lines 
were obtained from four field experiments, respectively, under the train speed of 115 km/h. The 
velocity peaks at 1.3, 2.5 and 3.8 are the frequencies of nV/L induced by the trainload, where n is a 
positive integer, V is the train speed (115 km/h) and L (23 m) is the compartment interval of the 
train [50]. These peaks can be clearly seen in the experimental and finite element results. The largest 
peak at 3.8 Hz is because the third frequency (3V/L) of the trainload is similar to the longitudinal 
natural frequency of the bridge. Generally, the accurate estimation of soil vibrations induced by 
moving trains is extremely difficult, since the wave generated by trains will propagate across 
bridges, bridge foundations and soils. Any error of the modeling may cause the inaccuracy of the 
finite element analysis. Thus, this comparison work is very limited in the literature. Figures 1.14 and 
1.15 show that the comparisons between experimental and finite element results are acceptably 
accurate, which indicates that the current moving vehicle model can be used to simulate complex 
practical problems with very large degrees of freedom.

1.4. Summary 
This study developed a finite element method to simulate complicated vehicles, where car 
bodies, bogies, wheel-axis sets, springs and dampers are modeled by assembling moving wheel 
elements, spring-damper elements, lumped mass and rigid link effect. The theory and formulations 
of this vehicle model are simple and can be added to a standard dynamic finite element codes 
without difficult. The Fryba’s solution [47] of a simply supported beam subjected to a moving 
two-axle system was analyzed to validate this finite element model. Simulations under the change of 
car speeds, wheel distances and road irregularities are almost identical for the two schemes, which 
means the proposed finite element model of moving vehicles is considerably accurate. 
 
Field experiments were also used to validate this finite element model. The measurement is the 
soil vibration induced by the SKS-700 high-speed train moving on multi-simply-supported bridges 
with pile foundations. From the complicated finite element analyses, the results are close to the 
experimental measurement, which indicates that the current moving vehicle model can be used to 
simulate complex problem with acceptable accuracy.

2.2.2. Comparison between the theoretical and finite element results 
Equations (2.8) to (2.11) were solved by the Newmark method and the results were compared 
with that of the finite element analysis. The bridge length is 30 m with the input data of E=2?108 
kPa, I=0.45853 m3 and ?=26.6 t/m3. The Japan SKS-700 train used in this study was modeled as 
48 sprung mass sets with the input data of K1=107 kN/m, C=1200 kN/m, Cb=10 kN-s/m, m1=0.5 t 
and m2=12 t. The distance between the first and the ith sprung mass sets (Li) can be calculated from 
Figure 2.3. The Newmark method was used to solve this problem with the Newmark constants of 
 29
first trainload frequency (fv=V/Lc) is usually the most important one that produces the vibrations for 
the train-bridge (Ju and Lin [53]) and train-soil (Ju and Lin [54]) interaction problems. The natural 
frequencies of the train and the simply supported beam can be approximate in Equations (2.14) and 
(2.12), which are cataloged as structural natural frequencies. If either of these two structural 
frequencies approaches the trainload frequency, resonance may be invoked.

where fv (Hz) is the dominant frequency of the trainload and fm (Hz) is the natural frequency of 
the train. 
 
To investigate this condition, three cases were generated using the beam and mass damping 
values as shown in Table 1, in which Cb equals a normal value of 10 kN-s/m and a small value of 1 
kN-s/m, respectively, and  equals a normal value of 0.05 and a large value 0f 0.5, respectively. 
The train and beam natural frequencies were changed by adjusting the mass per unit length of the 
beam ( ) from 10 to 200 T/m and the spring stiffness from 200 to 6000 kN/m. Other parameters are 
the same as those in Section 2.2.2.

. Figure 2.5 shows the beam central deflection changing with the 
frequency ratio (fb/fv or fm/fv). This figure indicates the following features: 
(1) The beam central deflection is highly dependent on the frequency ratio of fb/fv. When fv equals 
fb, the resonance of the bridge and train is very obvious. 
(2) The beam central deflection is almost independent of the frequency ratio of fm/fv. No resonance 
can be found when fm equals fv. 
(3) The damping of the bridge and sprung mass does not vary the resonance condition, but only 
changes the deflection magnitude. Moreover, the influence of the bridge deflection is minor due 
to the variation of the sprung mass damping. 
(4) To simulate the train-induced vibration for bridges accurately, the bridge model is more 
important than the vehicle model.

Figure 2.6  Bridge pier, piles and beam dimensions 
 
The Young's modulus of the bridge beams, bridge piers, and foundation caps and piles is 
3.02×107 kN/m2, 2.7×107 kN/m2, and 2×107 kN/m2, respectively. The Poisson's ratio and mass 
density of the complete bridge are 0.15 and 2.4 T/m3, respectively. The soil profile contains 10-m 
inorganic clays of low to medium plasticity, 40-m silty sands, and the rest is very hard sand. Since 
the amplitude of train-induced ground vibrations is very small, the site soils are expected to respond 
dynamically within the low-strain linear elastic range. The soil wave velocity experiment indicates 
that the Young's modulus of the surface soil is 7.5×104 kN/m2, and that of more than 50 m under the 
ground is 8×105 kN/m2. Linear interpolation was applied to determine Young's modulus between 
these two depths. The mass density and Poisson’s ratio of the soil are 2 T/m3 and 0.49, respectively. 
The two factors of Rayleigh damping ([Damping]=?[Mass]+?[Stiffness]) ? and ? for the soil 
equal 0.78/s and 3.7×10-4 s, respectively, which gives an approximately 2% damping ratio at a 
frequency of 4 Hz and 15 Hz. Shaker experiments were performed to measure the above soil 
damping using different load frequencies, and the least-squares method [55] was used to find ? 
and ? by fitting the measured vibration data. The two factors of Rayleigh damping, ? and ?,

2.3.2. Explanation of field measurements 
In field experiments, as shown in Figure 2.8, two stations each with three velocity sensors were 
set up to measure X, Y and Z vibration velocities with a distance of 100 and 200 m from the railroad 
centerline. A computer system was used to record the velocity histories of the three stations with a 
sample rate of 512 Hz (512 measurements per second). The field measurements were continuous for 
about eight hours per day, and computer software was used to pick up the 40-second data for the 
trains passing this region. Two groups of the 40-second ambient vibration data were also obtained 
200 seconds before and after each running train.

Figure 2.9  Finite element mesh of the bridge and foundations 
 
Figure 2.10 shows a typical 3D finite element mesh, which contains 1,393,987 nodes. The time 
step length is 0.005 second and 2,048 to 3,000 time steps are simulated (2,048 steps for train speed 
of 300 km/h and 3,000 steps for train speed of 220 km/h). This time step is about one tenth of the 
20-Hz wave period, so it is accurate enough to simulate waves lower than 20 Hz. The soil 
wavelength for the 10-Hz surface wave approximates to 22 m, about 6 times of the maximum 
element size (3.75 m), so the finite element analysis should be accurate enough for the wave 
frequencies lower than 10 Hz. The total computer time of the finite element analysis is about 10 
days using an Intel Pentium-4 3-GHz personal computer with 3-GB RAM.

directly. The averaged ambient vibration dB of 40 seconds before and after the moving train was 
erased from the data using Equation (2.20). At each location, we selected the time period (T in 
Equation (2.18)) equal to 8 seconds, and shifted 1 second to select another 8 seconds until the last 
time period was less than 8 seconds. Computer software was then used to find all the 1/3 octave 
band results for all the time periods, finally showing the extreme dB changes in the frequency 
domain at each location. 
 
2.5. Comparison of simulated and measured vibrations 
2.5.1. Vibration reduction by the rail longitudinal stiffness between simply supported beams 
In this study, the bridge is a series of simply supported beams with continuous rails between 
them. It is often to ignore continuous rails and analyze the bridge as simply supported beams. 
However, Ju [36] used numerical simulations to indicate that the continuous rails of multi-simply 
supported beams can considerably reduce the bridge vibration in the rail direction. To validate this 
experimentally, two finite element analyses were performed under the train speed of 300 km/h. Case

2.5.2. Difference between the simple moving load model and complicated train model 
Section 2.2.3 indicates that the bridge model is more important than the vehicle model to 
simulate the train-induced vibration for bridges. Thus, two cases of train models were generated. 
The first is the complicated train model as mentioned in Section 2.3.1, and the second is a very 
simple moving load model that only contains trainloads at train wheels. Finite element and 
experimental results for the train speed of 260 km/h are shown in Figure 2.12, which indicates that 
the two models obtain similar results and all agree well with the experiments, which is consistent 
with the conclusion of Section 3.3. However, for moving vehicles with serious road irregularity, as 
well as the evaluation of the vehicle response itself, a more precise vehicle model is still necessary.

frequency of the bridge in this study is about 5 to 6 Hz, much higher than the 3.3 Hz of the trainload 
at the maximum train speed of 300 km/h, so the field experiments did not obtain the same results 
under the resonance situation.

2.6. Summary 
To model soil vibrations induced by high-speed trains moving on bridges, finite element meshes often 
contain a large number of degrees of freedom, so the proper validation of the finite element analysis is 
important but it is also rare in the literature. This study generated finite element meshes including bridge 
superstructures, bridge foundations, moving trains and soils. Moreover, along the mesh boundaries, numerical 
schemes were used to avoid fictitious wave reflections. The dynamic responses of the finite element analyses 
were then compared with those of field measurements. Both numerical and experimental results show similar 
locations and magnitudes of the vibration peaks caused by the trainload whose frequency equals the integer 
times of the train speed over the carriage length. Since the comparison indicates that the predicted numerical 
and measured experimental results are in a good agreement, the proposed finite element model can be used to 
simulate the soil vibration induced by high-speed trains moving on bridges. 
 
The numerical solution of these equations is almost identical with the finite element solution, which 
indicates that both methods are suitable to analyze train-bridge interaction problems. For the problem of the 
bridge vibration induced by moving trains, the parametric study using those theoretical equations shows that the 
bridge model is more important than the vehicle model. The above condition was also found in the comparison 
of the result between field experiments and finite element analyses. When the finite element analysis does not 
model the continuous rail between two simply supported beams, the simulated longitudinal vibrations of the 
bridge will be too large. Moreover, using simple moving loads to replace the complicated train model also 
obtains acceptable finite element results.

For the field experiment, the velocity of vibration is measured directly. For the finite element 
analysis, the central difference method is used to transform the nodal displacements to nodal 
velocities. Then, the above equations can be used to find the vibration dB level. Equations (3.4) and 
(5) indicate that the vibration dB level is evaluated in logarithm scale. It can be approximately 
estimated that the increase of 6 dB means that the magnitude of the vibration response has increased 
by 2 times. 
 
3.1.2 Averaging scheme to estimate the vibration reduction due to foundation slabs 
The foundation slab is usually assumed to be rigid in their plane, so an averaging scheme can 
be employed to find the two in-plane translations and an out-of-plane rotation at the slab mass center. 
To find to representing value at the mass center, the procedure of this scheme is to take the average 
of the free-field translations and rotation within the slab area. For the free-field vibration from a 
finite element analysis, the formulations of the translations and rotation at the mass center of the 
rigid area can be estimated as:

in which the in-plane global directions are set to X and Y axes and the out-of-plane direction is

and the rotation in the Z-direction at the mass center, respectively; itX, itY and ir are the translation in 
the X direction, the translation in the Y direction and the rotation in the Z-direction at node i of the 
slab area, respectively; N is the number of nodes in the slab area. Translations itX, itY are obtained 
directly from finite element nodal displacements, and rotation ir can be calculated under the small 
deformation as follows:

homogeneous soil are 0.49 and 2 t/m3. Three groups of finite element analyses were performed. For the 
first group, the wave frequency of the source is 4.6 Hz. The soil Young’s modulus is 5E4 kN/m2, 1E5 
kN/m2 and 5E5 kN/m2 for three cases. The soil shear wave speeds of three soil types are 91.6 m/s, 
129.5 m/s and 289.6 m/s, respectively. The foundation slab is a square shape with the width of 20, 
40, 60, 80, 120 and 150 m for six cases, and the thickness equals 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 m for four cases. 
Thus, there are 72 finite element analyse (3x6x4) cases. For the second group, the wave frequency of 
the source is 4.6 Hz and the soil Young’s modulus is 5E5 kN/m2. The foundation slab is a rectangular 
shape with the dimensions of LX and LY, where LX and LY are 20, 40, 80 and 150 m for 16 cases, 
respectively. The slab thickness equals 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 m for 4 cases, so there are 64 finite element 
analyse cases totally (16x4). For the third group, the wave frequency of the source is 3.2 Hz and the 
soil Young’s modulus is 0.75E5 kN/m2. The foundation slab is a rectangular shape with the 
dimensions of LX and LY, where LX equals 100 m and LY equals 50, 70, 90, 110, 130 and 150 m for 
6 cases, respectively. The slab thickness equals 2, 7.5 and 22.5 m for 3 cases, so there are 18 finite 
element analyse cases totally (6x3). The slab thickness of 7.5 and 22.5 m are selected in this 
research as the extreme conditions.

slab center can be obtained by averaging the vibrations of the free field with the same region. The 
calculation steps are: (i) Equation (3.6) is used to find the time-history TX, TY and R within the 
measured area (Figure 3.2) from the finite element analysis without the foundation slab. (ii) The 
displacements of the four corners of the rigid rectangular slab were calculated from TX, TY and R, 
and then, the values of the velocity dBall at the four corners and the mass center were evaluated. (iii) 
The averaged velocity dBall of these five locations is dBrigid. Thus, dBfree-slab means the difference of 
the averaged dBall between the free field and the foundation slab, which represents the vibration 
reduction due to the foundation slab. If the dBfree-slab function is known, one can estimate the 
vibration in the foundation slab only using the measured free-field vibration. The value of dBfree-slab 
is obtained by known the variable of dBfree-rigid when the averaging scheme of the rigid slab theory is 
used.

3.2.3 Numerical results to model horizontal vibrations 
The results of modeling horizontal (X and Y) vibrations are shown in Figures 3.4 and 3.5 with 
the normalized slab size (a0 in Equation (3.8)) as the horizontal axis and dBfree-slab (legend as FEM) 
and dBfree-rigid (legend as rigid theory) as the vertical axis. The discussions of these figures are as 
follows: 
(1) When the normalized length a0 of the foundation slab increases, the trend of dBfree-slab in X and 
Y directions also increases, and the largest value can extend to 25 dB. This means that enlarging 
the in-plane dimensions of the foundation slab can decrease the vibration transferred from the 
 51
cause large error. However, this condition may be unobservable in the averaged dBfree-slab, because 
the major flexible vibration of a thin slab is produced near the slab boundary, and the result is not 
obvious after averaging them with other region. Thus, the maximum dBfree-slab changing with  is 
plotted in Figure 3.7, where the maximum dB
0a
free-slab is defined as the maximum dBall in the free field 
minus that in the slab. This value can represent the reduction efficiency near the slab boundary. 
Figure 3.7 indicates that some dBfree-slab values are much scattered at a certain a0 value. The reason is 
because the foundation slabs of those cases are too flexible and cannot be simulated as a rigid body. 
In this study, the stiffness ratio between the foundation slab and soil is assumed to be proportional to 
t/λf, where t is the slab thickness and λf is the soil shear wavelength with frequency of f. When t/λf 
is too small, the slab is not rigid enough. Accordingly, for t/λf <0.02, the values of dBfree-slab in 
Figure 3.7 are plotted as the circular symbol. If they are removed from the plotted data, the results 
shown in Figure 3.7 indicate that the separation of dBfree-slab is improved. Thus, to use Equation 
(3.12) conservatively, the criterion of t/λf >0.02 can be first checked. 
Figure 3.7 also indicates that the maximum dBfree-slab is slightly smaller than the value of the 
best-fit curve from the averaged dBfree-slab. This is because the maximum dBfree-slab is often obtained 
near the slab boundary, where shows more flexible effect than other region of the foundation slab. 
This condition is more obvious when the slab dimensions increase.

3.2.4 Numerical results to model vertical vibration 
  The values of dBfree-slab in the vertical direction were modeled using the parameter (Ect/(Esoilλf)) of 
Equation (3.9) as the horizontal axis. The result is shown in Figure 3.8, which indicates the 
following features: 
(1) All the data points of dBfree-slab changing with Ect/(Esoilλf) are concentrated along a banded curve 
with the acceptable variation. The logarithm function in Equation (3.13) is used to best fit the 
154 finite element data (dBfree-slab vs. Ect/(Esoilλf)). This equation can estimate the vertical 
reduction efficiency of the foundation slab, and only a simple parameter Ect/(Esoilλf) is required.

(2) When the parameter Ect/(Esoilλf) increases, the trend of dBfree-slab in Z direction also increases, 
and the largest value can extend to 15 dB. This means that enlarging the thickness of the 
foundation slab can decrease the vibration transferred from the soil. However, when parameter 
Ect/(Esoilλf) is smaller than 3, the reduction efficiency is near zero. When Ect/(Esoilλf) is less than 
10, the reduction efficiency is still low. For example, in a common situation as Ec=2.5E7 Kpa, 
Esoil=2E5 Kpa, soil shear wave speed VS=180 m/s and slab thickness t=2.5 m, and when 
parameter Ect/(Esoilλf) is larger than 10, the natural frequency of the soil vibration should be 
larger than 5.8 Hz according to Equation (3.9) for this example. This means that the reduction 
3.3 Experimental investigation 
3.3.1 Illustration of the measured building and soil data 
The field experiments were performed at the standard factory building of Luchu base in Taiwan 
for investigating the isolation efficiency of the foundation slab. The building has two reinforced 
concrete levels under the ground and five steel reinforce concrete stories above the ground (Figure 
3.10). The building foundation is the mat foundation with the plane dimensions of 84.2 and 75.3m 
as shown in Figure 3.11. The depth of the foundation beam is 2.4m including the upper and lower 
slabs with the thickness of 0.5m. The height of two stories under the ground is 3.5m respectively. 
The Young's modulus of the surface soil is 0.5e5 kN/m2 and more than 50 m under the ground is 5e5 
kN/m2. The linear interpolation is applied to determine the Young's modulus between these two 
depths. The mass density and Poisson’s ratio of the soil are 2 T/m3 and 0.49, respectively. Since the 
soil is not homogeneous, the shear wavelength and averaged Young’s modulus are the function of 
frequencies shown in Table 1, where the Young’s modulus (E) is the averaged value of those within 
the soil depth of a soil shear wavelength (λf).

F=a?sin(2?ft) (3.14) 
Where f is the force frequency from 1 Hz to 9 Hz, t is time (second) and a is function of f. 
For 1Hz?f?4.6Hz, a=88.42(f/4.6)2 kN; for 5Hz?f?7Hz, a=81.88(f/7)2 kN; for f=8 or 9 Hz, 
a=57.71(f/9)2 kN. 
Five observation stations are named as 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A and 5A in the standard factory building, 
and named as 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B and 5B outdoors (Figure 3.12). The purpose of the experiment is to 
compare the vibration reduction between the factory building and the outdoor in the same relative 
locations. Although the shaker generated forces only along the X-direction, observation stations 2A, 
3A, 4A, 2B, 3B and 4B will also produce vibrations in Y and Z directions. Especially in observation 
stations 2A and 2B, the vibrations of three directions have very similar amplitudes. 
 
The experiment was performed at midnight to avoid the interference induced by environmental 
vibrations. Experimental procedures are explained as follows: (1) First, started the shaker, and 
began to record the vibration. Each frequency was measured for two minutes with the sampling ratio 
of 500Hz. (2) Then, changed to the next frequency and measured again. The shaker frequency began 
at 1Hz, and finished at 9Hz. (3) After that, the shaker was stopped, and velocity meters were moved 
to the next floor. The standard factory building has two stories under the ground and five stories 
above the ground. Measurements were performed at the foundation slab (B2F), then basement level 
1 (B1F) and stopped at the first floor (1F).

Example 2: Vibration reduction of mat foundation induced by a wave source  
Figure 3.17 shows a sine-wave source on the foundation of Figure 3.1, and there is a 
reinforced-concrete mat foundation with the dimensions of 80m?80m?2m (length ? width ? 
thickness). The figure shows two locations of the mat foundation for two cases. The Young’s 
modulus, Poisson’s ratio and mass density of the homogeneous soil are 1E5 kN/m2, 0.49 and 2 t/m3. 
The finite element analyses are the same as the section of ‘numerical study of wave reduction due to 
foundation slabs’. The finite element results show that the vibration reductions in X and Z directions 
are 20.9 and 5.1 dB for case 1 and 19.1 and 8.9 dB for case 2. These two reduction values calculated 
from the best-fit formulas of Equations (3.12) and (3.13) are 20.3 and 7.8 dB, which predict the

Chapter 4. Investigating the behavior of the building vibration induced by 
micro-vibrations 
Finite element analyses were used to investigate the behavior of the building vibration 
induced by micro-vibrations. The model includes the bridge, nearby building, soil, moving 
train and absorbing boundary conditions. Finite element results indicate that trainload 
frequencies are more important than the natural frequencies of bridges and train compartments 
for building vibrations. If the building natural frequencies approach to the trainload 
frequencies, which equal an integer times the train speed over the compartment length, the 
resonance occurs and the building vibration will be large. Moreover, the shape of the building 
vibration is similar to the mode shape of the resonance building frequency. To isolate the 
building vibration induced by moving trains, this project investigates three common types of 
the foundation, which include the extension of the retaining walls, the pile foundation and the 
soil improvement around the building. For the three foundation types, the soil improvement 
around the building is the best way to reduce the building vibration both in horizontal and 
vertical directions.

4.3 Model of retaining wall by shell element 
The building containing the retaining wall on the unbounded soil field was modeled. 
Since the retaining wall is relatively thin compared to the infinite soil field, it requires very 
fine mesh to model the wall using 3D solid elements. Thus, applying shell elements to model 
the retaining wall is alternative. In this study, the 4-node shell degenerated element was used 
to model the floor slab and the retaining wall of the building. The membrane and transverse 
shear strains of the element were evaluated from the assumed natural strain field [59], and the 
bending strains were determined from the displacement model [60]. The following simulations 
indicate that the 4-node shell degenerated element incorporating the 3D solid element can 
model the retaining wall well in the large soil field. 
The validation example is a box soil profile fixed on the bottom with the dimensions of 
10 m long, 10 m wide and 20 m deep. Along the section center, a horizontal wall is built, and 
the material properties are E (Young’s modulus)=1e6 kPa, v (Poission’s ratio)=0.3 and?
(mass density)=2.0 t/m2 for soil and E=2e7 kPa, v=0.15 and?=2.4 t/m3 for concrete wall. 
Two finite element models were generated. In the first model (solid model), all the mesh was 
generated by 3D solid elements. In the second model (shell model), the concrete wall was 
generated by shell elements, which are only a surface located into the soil mesh modeled by 
3D solid elements. In this model, the Young’s modulus and mass density of the shell element 
equal the difference of the wall and soil, which are E=1.9e7 kPa and?=0.4 t/m3. We changed 
the wall thickness to compare the first six natural periods of the shell and solid models. The 
meshes are shown in Figure 4.2. The finite element result in Table 4.1 indicates a good 
agreement between the two models. The difference increases for the model with the thicker 
wall; however, within the reasonable wall thickness, the difference is small.

4.4.2 Illustration of building system 
Four buildings were analyzed, in which three of them are shown in Figure 4.5 and listed 
in Table 4.2. Building case 1 is a four-story factory, building case 2 is a 14-story building with 
the same plane dimensions of case 1 and building case 3 is a 24-story building. Building case 
4 has the same structure and member size of building case 2, but two pieces of 12-cm shear 
walls are meshed along the frames A and B as shown in Figure 4.5. The distance between the 
building edge and the bridge centerline is 48.75 m. The story height aboveground is 3 m and 
underground is 3.4 m. The retaining wall with the thickness of 0.6 m was built underground 
around the building and the wall depth is listed in Table 4.2.

bridge and pile foundation. Within the area of 2.8 m by 3.2 m on the center of the pile cap 
surface, a column modeled by two layers of 3D solid elements is used to simulate the 2-m 
covered soil layer. A master-slaved node scheme [52] is used to model the connection between 
the column simulated by 3D solid element and 3D beam element. The master node is arranged 
at the column center, and other nodes within this 2.8 m by 3.2 m area are set to slaved nodes, 
whose three degrees of freedom are dominated by the 6-degree-of-freedom master node. 
 
3D beam elements  
 
3D 8-node solid elements 
Figure 4.6  Finite element mesh of the bridge and foundations 
 
Figure 4.7 shows a typical 3D finite element mesh, which contains 928672 nodes. The 
time step length is 0.005 second and 2048 to 3000 time steps are simulated (2048 steps for 
train speed of 300 km/h and 3000 steps for train speed of 200 km/h). This time step is about 
one tenth of the 20-Hz wave period, so it is accurate enough to simulate the wave lower than 
20 Hz. The soil wavelength for the 10-Hz surface wave approximates to 22 m that is about 6 
times of the maximum element size (3.75 m), so the finite element analysis should be accurate 
enough for the wave frequencies lower than 10 Hz. 
 
A 24-bay bridge system (Figures 4.3 and 4.6) modeled by 3D beam elements is adopted 
in this study. The bearing plates of the simply supported beam are not located on the pier 
center, so a rigid beam system was used to model this eccentricity equal to 1.25 m shown in 
Figure 4.3. Moreover, because the distance between the railroad center and the simple beam 
center is 2.25 m (Figure 4.3), rigid beam elements whose Young’s modulus is 100 times as 
large as that of the concrete were arranged in the x-direction shown in Figure 4.6 to model this 
condition. These nodes at rigid-beam ends are the target nodes of the wheel elements that 
model the moving train.

In this study, all the nodal displacements on each floor of the analyzed building were 
obtained from the finite element analysis. Then, the central difference method was used to 
transform nodal displacements to nodal velocities. At each node, we selected the time period 
(T in Equation (4.6)) equal to 5.12 s (1024 time steps), and shifted 0.25 s to select another 
5.12 s until the last time period is not enough to 5.12 s. Computer software, then, was used to 
find all the 1/3 octave band results for all the time periods. Finally, showed the extreme dB 
changing with frequencies on each floor. 
 
4.4.5 Natural frequencies of the building and dominated frequencies of the trainloads 
The first-mode natural frequencies of the bridge are 2.23 Hz in the Y-direction with the 
effective mass ratio of 44% and 2.70 Hz in the X-direction with the effective mass ratio of 
58%. The effective mass ratios of the frequencies in the Z-direction are not concentrated, and 
the frequencies are separated between 4.76 Hz and 5.19 Hz with the total effective mass ratio 
of 8%. These values were obtained from a natural-frequency and mode-shape analysis. The 
foundation of the bridge was simulated using equivalent mass, damping and stiffness matrices 
[61]. The superstructure and piers of the bridge are the same model shown in Figure 4.6. 
 
The natural frequencies of the four building (Table 4.2) are shown in Table 4.3. In the 
natural-frequency analysis, the building mesh was generated in a soil profile with the 
dimensions of 131x98x32 m (length x width x depth). The rollers perpendicular to soil profile 
surfaces were used except the upper surface that has the free boundary condition. Figure 4.8 
shows the mesh of building case 2 with the 2nd mode shape in the global Y direction.

4.5 Analysis illustrations and discussions 
Figure 4.9 shows the surface displacements of the finite element analysis with the second 
building case and under the train speed of 240 km/h. The soil wave along the mesh boundary 
is smooth due to the absorbing boundary condition that diminishes the reflected wave. The 
major wave (frequency=5.2 Hz, wave length=50 m) shown in this figure is due to the 
resonance of the first bridge vertical frequency (5.19 Hz) and the second frequency of 
trainloads (nV/L=5.33 Hz, where n=2). The vibrations on the soil surface and each building 
floor were arranged using the dB formula (Equation (4.10)). Figure 4.10 shows the vibrations 
of the velocity (dB) on each floor for building cases 1 and 3, and Figure 4.11 shows that for 
building cases 2 and 4. The analyses of the cases without buildings were also performed under 
the train speed of 200, 240, 270 and 300 km/h, and then, the vibrations of the velocity (dB) on 
the site of building case 1 were calculated using the dB formula listed in section 4.4.4. These 
velocity vibrations are shown in Figures 4.10 and 4.11 as labeled by A, B, C and D for the 
train speed of 200, 240, 270 and 300 km/h, respectively. The two figures indicate the 
following features: 
(1) The vibration on the soil surface without buildings is always larger than that on the first 
floor of the four building cases. This means that the vibration can be reduced when the 
wave passes from the soil to the building foundation, and the reason is because the 
building foundation reduces the vibration. The X-vibration can be reduced to 15 dB 
averagely, but the reduction of the Y-vibration is a little worse than that of the X-vibration. 
Since the horizontal, X and Y, vibrations are coupled together, it is reasonable to reduce 
the two vibrations to a similar value. The Z-vibration can be reduced to 5 dB averagely, 
which is much less efficient than the horizontal reduction. This is because the stiffness of 
the foundation in the vertical direction is much smaller than that in the horizontal 
direction. 
(2) The X-vibrations of building 1 increase with the floor number, which is obvious the 
first-mode vibration. The reason can be found in Table 2, where the first building natural 
frequency of 3.02 Hz in the X-direction is just near the first loading frequencies of the 
moving train under V=200 to 300 km/h and the second building natural frequency of 9.4 
Hz is far away from them. Especially when the train speed (V) equals 270 km/h, the first 
loading frequency of the moving train (V/L=3.0 Hz) is very similar to the first X-direction 
natural frequency (3.02 Hz) of the building case 1, which means that the resonance occurs. 
Thus, the X-vibration under the train speed of 270 km/h is the largest. This condition can 
be further explained in Figure 4.12(a), which shows the relationship between the

(5) Similar to building case 1, the X-vibrations of building case 4 increase with the floor 
number, which is obvious the first-mode vibration. The reason is that the first building 
natural frequency of 2.49 Hz in the X-direction is just near the first loading frequencies of 
the moving train under V=200 to 300 km/h and the second building natural frequency of 
7.3 is far away from them. When the train speed (V) equals 200 km/h, the first loading 
frequency of the moving train (V/L=2.2 Hz) is similar to the first X-direction natural 
frequency (2.49 Hz) and the first Z-rotation natural frequency (1.99 Hz) of the building 
case 4. Thus, the X-vibration under the train speed of 200 km/h is the largest. Since the 
loading frequencies (3 and 3.33 Hz) under the train speed of 270 and 300 km/h are much 
larger than the first X-frequency (2.49 HZ) of the building case 1, the X-vibrations at 
these conditions are smaller. 
(6) The above complex discussions, however, indicate a simple criterion that the frequencies 
of trainloads (nV/L in Equation (4.12)) are the most critical item to influence the building 
vibration. Other natural frequencies, such as those of bridges and compartments are less 
important than those of trainloads. If the building natural frequencies approach to the 
frequencies of trainloads, especially for the first frequency (n=1), the resonance occurs 
and the building vibration will be large; moreover, the shape of the building vibration is 
similar to the mode shape of the resonance building frequency. Generally, the resonance at 
the first building natural frequency is the most serious. This critical condition can be 
found in the building case 1, which is much lower than building cases 2 and 3 (Figure 4.5), 
but the X-vibration is the largest. The second example can be found in the building cases 2 
and 4. The shear wall is usually constructed to reinforce the building; however, the 
vibration of building case 4 with extra two pieces of shear walls is larger than the 
vibration of the building case 2 that without shear walls. The reason is because the 
resonance at the first building natural frequency occurs for the building case 4. The third 
example is that the smallest ground vibration under the train speed of 200 km/h usually 
causes resonance of the building and trainloads, and then, produces the largest building 
vibrations. 
(7) For each building case, the behavior of the building vibration in the Y direction is similar 
to that in the X direction. Trainload frequencies play an important role for the building 
vibration, especially for the resonance of the first natural frequency between the building 
and trainloads. For example, the Y-vibration of building case 4 under V=200 km/h is the 
largest in Figure 4.11. The reason is that the first building natural frequency (1.99 Hz) of 
the Z-rotation is near the frequency (2.22 Hz) of trainloads under V=200 km/h, but

(3) To reduce vertical vibration, the soil improvement still has the best performance. For 
buildings 1 and 2, the vertical vibration can be reduced about 6 dB. For building 3, the 
vibration reduction is low because of the resonance condition as explained in discussion (8) 
of the previous section. The pile foundation can also decrease the vertical vibration to 
about 4 dB for buildings 1 and 2. The extension of the retaining wall seems inefficient to 
reduce vibration both in horizontal and vertical directions.

Conclusions 
To satisfy the requirement of passenger transportation, more and more high-speed 
railway lines have been constructed in the world, and as a result, noise and vibration problems 
are thus becoming increasingly trouble some. For example, the traffic-induced vibration might 
affect the normal operations of precision instruments used in hospital operations and precision 
production workshops. During the past several years, the generation and propagation of the 
traffic-induced ground vibration has been a concern to researchers from the field of civil and 
transportation engineering because of its environmental impact. The main conclusions drawn 
from this research are stated as following: 
[1] This study developed a finite element method to simulate complicated vehicles, where car 
bodies, bogies, wheel-axis sets, springs and dampers are modeled by assembling moving 
wheel elements, spring-damper elements, lumped mass and rigid link effect. The 
advantages of this vehicle model are (1) the dynamic matrix equation is symmetric, (2) the 
theory and formulations are very simple and can be added to a standard dynamic finite 
element codes easily and (3) very complicated vehicle models can be assembled using the 
proposed elements as simple as the traditional finite element method. 
[2] The dominated train frequencies of nV/L can be clearly seen from the finite element 
analyses of the multi-span bridges with high piers and simply supported beams. To avoid 
resonance, the dominated train frequencies and the bridge natural frequencies should be as 
different as possible, especially for the first dominated train frequency and the first bridge 
natural frequency in each direction. If the two first frequencies are similar, the resonance 
can be serious. 
[3] For the problem of the bridge vibration induced by moving trains, the bridge model is 
more important than the vehicle model. This condition was also found in the comparison 
of the result between field experiments and finite element analyses. Moreover, using 
simple moving loads to replace the complicated train model also obtains acceptable finite 
element results. 
[4] The soil damping is much more important than bridge damping for soil vibration induced 
by moving trains because the duration of the wave traveling within soil is much more than 
that within bridges. Thus, precise soil damping should be used to perform the finite 
element analysis of train-induced vibration. 
[5] A suitable axial stiffness between two simple beams can reduce vibrations at a near 
resonance condition. The axial stiffness of the continuous railway and the friction of the 
bearing plate should be enough to obtain this axial stiffness. However, extra-axial-links
