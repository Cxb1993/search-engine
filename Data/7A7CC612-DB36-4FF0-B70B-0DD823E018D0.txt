this way, the simulation could reduce the number of 
the impact sound insulation test, cost, and time.

impact sound of composite steel deck floors.5 Su utilized just one 
finite element code to simulate the impact that induces sound 
radiation and the impact sound insulation of steel-composed 
floor.12 Finite element model was used to modify the access floor to 
analyze the effects of panel thickness and panel size on the impact 
sound insulation,13 and it was also used to modify a double rooms 
with a light gauge frame partition to discuss the effects of the 
thickness of the light gauge frame partition, the volume of the 
double room, and the absorption coefficient of the interior 
decoration materials.14 
Since actual field measurements are time-consuming and have 
high costs, finite element simulation with better operation speed 
and low cost is a worth alternative to evaluate the prognosis 
mechanism15 for improving strategy for floor impact sound. From 
the above reviewed literature, the current finite element simulation 
for floor impact sound always focuses on the light weight impact 
source from tapping machine, because the simulation is under the 
implicit mode that is easy to apply. However, to simulate the impact 
conditions of heavy weight impact source like the rubber ball, an 
explicit finite element analysis is required. The purpose of the 
present work is to use explicit finite element, for example LS-DYNA, 
to model the impact behavior of the rubber ball. To precisely 
simulate the impact force, three different material models for the 
rubber are investigated. They are kinematic hardening plastic 
material model, Mooney-Rivlin rubber model, and 
hyperviscoelastic rubber mode. In addition, some parameter 
values in these three models will be determined by try and error to 
create the standardized heavy weight impact forces. As this 
simulation model has been established, it could be used to 
calculate the vibration properties or to evaluate the sound 
insulation of floor coverings under heavy weight impact.

2. PROPERTIES OF IMPACT FORCE 
The available heavy weight floor impact sources include bang 
machine, automobile tire, rubber ball, and sand ball, etc. Recently, 
the rubber ball is popular and standardized. The standard rubber 
ball as listed in table 1 is a hollow sphere with the diameter of 180 
mm, the thickness of 30 mm, and the mass of 2.5±0.1 kg. Its 
coefficient of restitution is about 0.8±0.1 and Shore A hardness is 
about 40±5. Before it hits the floor, the rubber ball is freely fallen 
from 1 m height. The maximum impact force is about 1500 N, and 
the impact duration is 20±2 ms. One possible wave form of this 
impact force is illustrated in Fig. 1.16 Some calculated values from 
Fig. 1 are listed in table 2. The force integration represents the 
integration of the impact force with respect to time, and its value is 
about 19.92 secN • . The maximum impact force is 1563.83 N, 
and its average value is 996.08 N. The instantaneous velocity at 
impact is 4.427 m/sec, and the average acceleration is 398.43 
2m/sec .

3. MATERIAL MODEL OF RUBBER BALL 
To model the nonlinear behavior of rubber balls, three material 
models that are available in the LS-DYNA are evaluated in this 
work. They are kinematic hardening plastic material model, 
Mooney-Rivlin rubber model, and hyperviscoelastic rubber model. 
These three models are commonly used to model rubber materials. 
However, due to the limit of available experimental data, some 
parameter values in these three models need to be determined by 
try and error. 
3.1. Kinematic Hardening Plastic Material Model 
This model is suited to model isotropic and kinematic hardening 
plasticity with the option of including rate effects. For a nonlinear 
and elastic-plastic material, this model uses a strain increment εd , 
which could be represented as 
pe ddd εεε +=  (1) 
where edε  is the elastic strain increment and pdε
 
is the plastic 
strain increment. The corresponding stress increment could be 
represented as 
εσ dEd t=  (2) 
where tE  is the tangent modulus. If the plastic strain increment is 
separated from the strain increment, then the relation between the 
stress increment and the plastic strain increment is 
p
pdEd εσ =  (3) 
where pE  is the plastic modulus. The relation between the stress 
increment and the elastic increment is 
eEdd εσ =
 
(4) 
where E is the Young’s modulus. Therefore, these three moduli 
have the following relation. 
rubber ball with the density of 1163 3kg/m  are listed in table 1. As 
shown in Fig. 2, the finite element mesh has 9368 elements and 
13607 nodes. As for the boundary conditions, the four sides of the 
RC floor are set to be fixed as illustrated in Fig. 3. To save the 
simulation time, the rubber ball is released at the height of 0.002 m 
from the surface of the RC floor with the velocity of 4.425 m/sec, 
and the gravity is enforced along the vertical direction in Fig. 2. 
During the simulation, the tangent modulus of the rubber ball in the 
kinematic hardening plastic material model will be varied from 1.5 
kPa to 45 kPa. For both the Mooney-Rivlin rubber model and 
hyperviscoelastic rubber model, the two parameters A and B will be 
varied according to Shore A hardness. The corresponding values 
between Shore A hardness, Young’s modulus, shear modulus, 
parameter A, and parameter B for rubber materials are shown in 
table 3.18

5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The simulation results including force integration, maximum impact 
force, average impact force, average acceleration, and impact 
duration obtained by the kinematic hardening plastic material 
model are shown in table 4. The last row in this table represents 
the target experimental values from standard heavy impact 
source.12 As shown in this table, the variation of the tangent 
modulus from 1.5 kPa to 45 kPa does not clearly change the 
simulation results, and these results have evident gap with the 
target values. Hence, the kinematic hardening plastic material 
model should not be a good choice to model the behavior of the 
rubber ball under impact conditions. 
The simulation results obtained by the Mooney-Rivlin rubber 
model are listed in table 5 for the Shore A hardness from 40 to 50. 
As shown, the variations of the force integration and the impact 
duration are small, while the maximum impact force has clear 
changed from 1396 N to 1648 N. Similarly, the average impact 
force is varied from 838 N to 1087 N, and the average acceleration 
ranges from 327 to 427 2m/sec . As compared to the target values 
listed in table 4, it is clear that the suitable Shore A hardness 
should be around 46 to 47. Since there is no available data for the 
parameters A and B corresponding to the Shore A hardness from 
46 to 47, linear interpolation is applied to create the corresponding 
values as listed in table 6. The simulation results for Shore A 
hardness from 46 to 47 are shown in table 6. As compared to the 
target values, the case with the Shore A hardness of 46.8 has the 
best agreement and is recommended. At this case, the maximum 
impact force is 1574 N, the average impact force is 990 N, and the 
average acceleration is 388 2m/sec .

When the hyperviscoelastic rubber model is applied, the 
simulated results are shown in table 7 for the Shore A hardness 
from 40 to 50. Similar to the results from the Mooney-Rivlin rubber 
model, the force integration and the impact duration have very 
small variation, while the other three quantities have clear changes. 
Comparing table 5 and table 7 indicates that the result difference 
between these two models is small. This may be contributed from 
the similar equations of the strain energy density function. 
According to the values of the maximum impact force, the average 
impact force, and the average acceleration, the suitable Shore A 
hardness should be around 46 to 47. Similarly, linear interpolation 
is enforced to create the corresponding values for the Shore A
