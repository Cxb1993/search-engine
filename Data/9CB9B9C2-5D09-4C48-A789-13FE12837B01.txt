The LTCC bandpass filter falls into two 
categories. One is semi-lump filter[5][6][7]. 
There are two features for this type of filter.  
From circuit point of view, it comprises of 
distributed inductors and lumped capacitors.  
From 3-D physical structure point of view, it 
posses the vertical via that is often used to 
connect electrode layers for implementing the 
lump capacitor, so that the freedom of 3D 
design for this type of filter is high.  Thus, 
the main advantages of this type of LTCC 
bandpass filter have the miniaturization and 
the generating more attenuation poles by 
using high orders. However, in general, more 
electrode and dielectric layers are necessary  
to implement the distributed inductor and 
lumped capacitor to achieve the desirable 
electrical properties for such a filter with high 
order. Therefore, a too high insertion loss of 
this type filter is main concern.      
 The other is comb-line filter, from circuit 
point of view, it comprises of a pair of couple 
lines of less than a quarter-wavelength and 
lumped capacitors[8][9]. The resonators are 
electro-magnetically coupled for constructing 
a multi-pole filter.  One open end of each 
line resonator is connected the grounded 
capacitor to shorten the length of resonator. 
From 3-D physical structure point of view, 
there is no vertical via to connect the 
electrode layers, so the freedom of 3D design 
is low. In general, six layers of dielectric and 
five layers of conductor are used to 
implement the type of filter. Because the 
geometry of this type of filter is simple 
leading to that the insertion loss at passband is 
low. However, this type of filter is more 
difficult to reduce the physical size and to 
generate more attenuation poles due to 
via-free.   
 A notable band-pass filter structure that 
truly utilizes the LTCC features is presented 
in [10], where a mutual inductive coupling was 
achieved by overlapping the two inductor 
strips in the Z-direction. The inductive mutual 
coupling is equivalent to inserting, in series, 
an LC resonator tank between two resonators. 
Therefore one finite transmission zero can be 
introduced to improve the selectivity at the 
image frequency. To generate the second 
transmission zero, a common approach to 
producing finite transmission zeros is to form 
a feedback path by adding a coupling 
capacitor between I/O ports[11]. It has shown 
that this change will introduce two finite zero, 
instead of one, to the transmission response of 
the filter. Two transmission zeros improve the 
filter selectivity by trading off the attenuation 
at the far ends of both the lower and upper 
band. However, unfortunately, the two 
transmission zeros are dependent indicating 
that two finites transmission zeros at different 
sides of the passband are not allowed to tune 
arbitrarily.     
 This paper describes a filter, which is 
designed basically in the same manner as in 
Toshioishizas’s work[12]. The novel LTCC 
comb-line filter topology described in this 
paper offers two distinct features. In addition 
to it being implemented in a 3D comb-line 
configuration to allow a minimized size, a 
new circuit schematic is also proposed to have 
two independent transmission zeros located at 
arbitrary frequency or to have three dependent 
transmission zeros.

study. The finite transmission zeros of the 
filter are located at the frequency where 
S21(ω)=0 or Y21(ω)=0. Evidently, there are 
two finite transmission zeros for this filter. 
One is from a pair of parallel stripline 
resonator, the other is from the Li Ci resonator.  
The calculated results for transmission 
aracteristic of the filter are respectively 
shown in Fig. 4 and 5 regarding values of Li, 
Ci and the gaps between two striplines. It is 
clearly to see this filter has two independent 
finite transmission zeros, one is in the lower 
stopband that can be controlled by varying the 
value of Ci and Li without changing the 
frequency of the finite transmission zero in 
the upper stopband.
