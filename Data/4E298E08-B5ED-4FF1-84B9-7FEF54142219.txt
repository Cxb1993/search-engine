（二） 計畫英文摘要 
Determination of optimal cutting parameters for satisfying certain technological and 
economical conditions by adjusting the cutting parameters like cutting speed, feed and 
depth of cut, is one of the most important elements in process planning of metal cutting 
operations. Several cutting constraints that should be considered in such a machining 
economics problem include: tool life constraint, cutting force constraint, power limitation, 
stable cutting region constraint, chip-tool interface temperature constraint, surface finish 
constraint, and roughing and finishing parameter relations. Most of the literatures for the 
machining economics had focused on single cutting operation. However, in reality most 
parts require more than one operation. In addition, the technology of the machine tools 
have been well developed so that a single computer numerical control (CNC) machine is 
capable of performing multiple operations, even simultaneously with multiple spindles 
and cutting tools. When several operations are performed in a multi-task CNC machining 
center, various tools are required for the cutting operations. Determining the tool lives of 
the tools for different cutting conditions is a nightmare for the shop-floor operator. The 
operator usually replaces the tools by his experience or the handbooks of the tools. 
Frequent tool replacements may cause some waste on tool utilization, while seldom tool 
replacements may risk of making parts with poor quality. This research has been planned 
for two years. The portion for the first year currently has been carried out. In this part, a 
mathematical model in which various operations (turning, drilling, boring, chamfering, 
and cutting off) performed with proper constraints are considered will be proposed. The

Most of the literatures on machining economics problems tend to focus on single cutting operations.
However, in reality most parts that need to be machined require more than one operation. In addition,
machining technology has been developed to the point that a single computer numerical control (CNC)
machine is capable of performing multiple operations, even simultaneously, employing multiple
spindles and cutting tools. When several operations are performed on a CNC turning machine, various
tools are required for the cutting operations. Determining the life of these cutting tools under different
machining conditions is an arduous task for the operators. They usually replace the tools based on their
experience or according to the speciﬁc cutting tool handbook. Frequent tool replacements may result in
wasted tools and tool utilization, while infrequent tool replacements may result in poorly machined
parts. In this study we propose a mathematical model in which several different turning operations
(turning, drilling, and parting) with proper constraints are performed. The issue of tool replacement is
taken into account in the proposed cutting model. In addition, an evolutionary strategy (ES)-based
optimization approach is developed to optimize the cutting conditions of the multiple turning-related
operations while taking into account the minimizing unit cost criteria under the economical tool
replacement strategy.

1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, the effective utilization of CNC
machines, with their high initial cost and their high operating costs
is becoming increasingly important to the shop ﬂoor manager. As a
result, the decision regarding the selection of the correct values for
the machining parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, and
depth of cut have a signiﬁcant impact on product quality, production
rate, and ultimately manufacturing cost. In practice, the machining
parameters for speciﬁc cutting conditions are usually determined
based on the shop ﬂoor operator’s experience or by following the
guidelines in the handbook of the speciﬁc machine tool or equip-
ment manufacturers. However, taking into account the real world
constraints such as limited machine power, maximum cutting force
of the cutting tools, and the cutting temperature that may reduce
tool life and affect the dimensional accuracies of the work piece as
well as the surface ﬁnish, etc. it is not easy to determine these
parameters. In turning operations, a cutting process can possibly be
completed with a single pass or it may require multiple passes. In
the machining industry, multi-pass turning is preferred over single-
pass turning for economic reasons [1]. A multi-pass cutting
operation involves several roughing cuts and a single ﬁnishing cut.
This makes determining the optimal cutting conditions both difﬁcult
and complicated. To obtain the parameters for the optimal cutting
conditions for a complex turning operation, it is necessary to
develop a mathematical model for this turning operation.
When it comes to the machining economics problem in the
literature, most studies focus on the single operation. In reality,
however, producing a part with an intricate geometry may require a
series of machining operations. Today’s modern CNC machines are
capable of performing various tasks, such various turning and
related operations like drilling, threading, facing, parting, etc. with
different cutting tools on a single CNC turning center. The cutting
tools are held on a 6–8 station turret that is capable of indexing up
to the tools into position. Hence, due to the ability to quickly change
cutting tools, the turret lathe is used for high-production work,
requiring a sequence of cuts to be made on the part [2]. In such
highly automated machining equipment, manual operations like
part handling and tool replacement become extremely important.
How often the parts are to be handled is readily determined, but the
intervals for tool replacements are much harder to establish since
the tools wear gradually. Therefore, frequent tool replacements may
result in wasted tools and wasted tool utilization, while infrequent
tool replacements may result in poorly machined parts.
We therefore propose a new cutting model that takes into
consideration the machine condition optimization for performing
multiple turning-related operations using a single CNC turning

lower production cost than obtained by Chen and Tsai [1]. However,
the optimal value obtained by Onwubolu and Kumalo was argued
impractical by Chen and Chen [8]. They pointed out that Onwubolu
and Kumalo did not limit the number of rough cuts to an integer
value. For the same problem, Vijayakumar et al. [9] proposed an ant
colony optimization method and claimed that their ant colony based
approach found an even better solution with less runs than either
the approach of Chen and Tsai or the GA-based approach of
Onwubolu and Kumalo. However, their solution was later proven
to be invalid [10].
2.2. Optimization of the machining conditions for multiple
operations
As mentioned before, tool replacement becomes an important
issue when considering that several operations are being per-
formed on a single machine. Amiolemhen and Ibhadode [11]
proposed a GA-based method for minimizing the unit production
cost of converting a cylindrical bar stock into a continuous
ﬁnished proﬁle. Their complex machining model involves seven
individual machining operations. The tool replacement issue
however was not considered in their study.
Not many studies have linked the tool replacement problem
with the lower-level problem of optimizing machining conditions.
Linn et al. [12] proposed a model for a job sequencing problem
integrated with the machining economics problem of a turning
process in a just-in-time delivery environment. Their model dealt
with a problem of scheduling a batch of 15 jobs. For each job
however, the machining economics problem was simpliﬁed to
only select the optimal cutting speed within ﬁve predetermined
discrete settings. Akturk and Avci [13] developed a model for
simultaneously selecting the optimal machining conditions and
allocating tools to minimize the production cost of a multiple
operation case where there can be alternative tools for each
operation. Akturk et al. [14] built another model that linked job
sequencing, machining control, and the tool replacement pro-
blem. This time their objective was to minimize the total job
completion time. They proposed a series of procedures including
a GA-based methodology to solve the problem where the job
processing times and the tool usage are controlled by only setting
the cutting speed and the feed rate.
3. Formulation of the problem
Assume that we are given an assignment of machining
identical parts for mass production. The problem is to determine
the optimal machining conditions on a CNC turning center, which
is capable of performing various turning-related tasks. Suppose
that the starting stock is a cylindrical bar. This bar must be
machined by several straight rough turnings and one ﬁnishing
turning to obtain the required outside diameter. This is then
followed by two drilling operations using different size drills. The
ﬁnished part is then cutoff.
3.1. Objective function
For this problem, four operations (three types of
operations—straight turning, drilling, and cutting off) must be
performed to complete a single part. For the straight turning
operation, the objective is presented as follows:

The ﬁrst element on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) is the
machining cost. The second element is the machine idle cost. The
third and fourth elements are related to the tool replacement cost
incurred by the time spent on replacing the worn tools with new
tools. The ﬁfth and sixth elements are the cost of the tools. In this
case, ﬁve different cutting tools (for several passes of rough
turning, one ﬁnishing turning, two drilling operations, and one
parting) are used to complete one single part. Any of these ﬁve
tools must be replaced whenever it is worn or damaged. Tool
wear is highly dependent upon the cutting conditions. From an
economical perspective, cutting tools should be used as much as
possible. Therefore, the ideal tool replacement interval should be
set below, but as close as possible to the tool’s useful lifetime.
Tool replacement takes time because all movements must be
temporarily stopped for safety reasons, and thus another setup
will be required. In order to reduce the idle time of tool replace-
ments, we propose to use the shortest tool life among the ﬁve
cutting tools as the basic unit of tool replacement cycle time. The
tool replacement cycle time of the other tools will be set by
multiplying some integer numbers by the basic unit of tool
replacement cycle time. As a result, some tools (at least two) will
be replaced at the same time. For instance, the tool life of tool
A (TA) is 3 min under certain cutting conditions, and it is also the
basic tool replacement cycle time. Even though the tool life of tool
B (TB) is 7 min under certain cutting conditions, based on the
above mentioned idea, since TA must be replaced every 3 min, TB
must be replaced every 6 min rather than 7 min, which is the
actual tool life. Although this tool replacement strategy may
cause some waste since the cutting tool is still reliable when
replaced, it provides the beneﬁt of reducing the number of tool
replacements. According to the model proposed by Yip-Hoi and
Dutta [15], the waste of the cutting tools can be modiﬁed and
expressed as the last two elements of Eq. (1).
For the drilling operation, the cost objective function can be
shown as follows [16]:

recombination, the features of the individual offspring may either
be intact or mutated from either parent. In intermediate recom-
bination, the features of the individual offspring are determined
as the average of the features of both parents. In the proposed ES,
the intermediate recombination in its global form as proposed by
Ba¨ck and Schwefel [19] is adopted.
After recombining the two selected parents they form a new
individual. This individual has to be mutated to yield an offspring.
The entire mutation procedure consists of two procedures:
ﬁrst mutate the standard deviations and then mutate the decision
variables.

The value of ga is set to be 1 for the ﬁrst 100 generations. After
that, ga is increased by 1 every 100 generations. Based on this
idea, the proposed ES will move its search with the larger ‘‘step
size’’ in the early stages in order to avoid being trapped in local
optimal solutions. Later the step size of the search gets narrowed
to prevent jumping out of the good solution area.
