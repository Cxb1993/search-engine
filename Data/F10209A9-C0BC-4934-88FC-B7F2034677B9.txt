二、 英文摘要 
This work reports the significant N-shaped 
negative-differential resistance characteristics 
with three-terminal controllability of a 
monolithic heterostructure resonant tunneling 
field-effect transistor (HRT-FET), realized by 
integrating the AlAs/In0.25Ga0.75As/AlAs 
double-barrier single-well (DBSW) resonant 
tunneling (RT) structure into the drain regime 
of the In0.49Ga0.51P/In0.25Ga0.75As/GaAs 
δ-HEMT. A peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) 
in excess of 960 at room temperature has been 
demonstrated, with a peak current density (Jp) 
of 50.6 mA/mm, and a valley current density 
(Jv) of 52.7 µA/mm, respectively, with a 
transistor gate length of 1.0 µm. The maximum 
current drive density was observed to be 478 
A/mm-cm2. 
Keywords: NDR, δ-doping, resonant tunneling, 
peak-to-valley current ratio 
 
三、 計畫的緣由與目的 
N-shaped NDR characteristics have been 
widely investigated [1]-[6] since the 
development of the Esaki diode in 1958 [7], 
mainly due to their promising applications in 
voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO’s), low- 
noise amplifier (LNA’s), signal processing, and 
microwave circuits [8]-[12]. The resonant 
interband tunnel (RIT) diodes were proposed [13] 
to improve the PVCR performance by 
combining the advantages of the interband Esaki 
diodes and the interband resonant tunneling 
diodes. The PVCR figure of merit was defined to 
 4
the etching barrier to etch the remaining down 
into the n+-GaAs source ohmic contact layer, 3) 
perform mesa isolation by etching down to the 
undoped GaAs buffer layer, 4) define and 
evaporate the source electrode, 5) use the 
drain/source electrodes as the etching barriers to 
selectively etch the remaining down onto the 
undoped In0.49Ga0.51P gate Schottky contact layer, 
and, finally, 6) define and evaporate Au as the 
gate electrode with gate recess. The transistor 
gate length is 1.0 µm, with a gate-to-drain 
spacing of 3 µm. Selective etching between 
InGaP and GaAs, in step 5, was adopted to 
precisely expose such a deep position of the gate 
deposition and, at the same time, prevent the 
gate leakage by gate recess. Standard photo- 
lithography and lift-off techniques were 
employed for device fabrication. An Au/Ni/ 
AuGe metal layer sequence was used for the 
source and drain ohmic contacts, yet no 
annealing was performed to avoid deteriorating 
the impurity barrier function of the undoped 
In0.25Ga0.75As spacers. As indicated in Fig. 1, the 
RT DBSW was integrated into the drain regime. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.1 The schematic cross section of the studied monolithic 
InGaAs/AlAs/ InGaP/GaAs HRT-FET. 
The anode terminal shares with the transistor 
drain electrode, while the cathode was in the 
same layer with the source terminal. 
Figure 2 shows the current-voltage 
characteristics of the device studied at room 
temperature with the gate bias decreased from 0 
V to -1.5 V. Significant N-shaped NDR 
characteristics with the PVCR performance in 
excess of 960 have been accomplished at VGS = 
0 V and VDS = 1.24 V, whereas, with the peak 
current density (Jp) of 50.6 mA/mm and the 
valley current density (Jv) of 52.7 µA/mm, 
respectively, with the transistor gate dimensions 
of 1.0 × 140 µm2. Comparably high PVCR 
values of 913, 888, and 845 were also observed 
at VGS = -0.5 V, -1.0 V, and -1.5 V, respectively. 
Since the gate bias modulates the potential of the 
buried cathode, its voltage difference with drain 
will determine the potential drop across the 
DBSW regime in the HRT-FET device. 
Excellent PVCR performance is attributed to the 
improved quantum tunneling mechanisms 
obtained by using the AlAs/In0.25Ga0.75As/AlAs 
DBSW structure. The integrated InGaP/InGaAs/ 
GaAs δ-HEMT [18] was designed to provide 
monolithic three-terminal controllability of the 
PVCR performances.  
The upper/lower undoped In0.25Ga0.75As 
spacers, as shown in Fig. 1, were designed to 
prevent diffusion of the impurities degrading the 
DBSW quantum structure. Two subbands, E0 
and E1, were formed in narrow-gap 
In0.25Ga0.75As well sandwiched by two wide-gap 
AlAs barriers. Subbands were self-consistently 
calculated to be -152 meV and 225 meV [19], 
with respect to the Fermi level. Therefore, 
resonant tunneling peak current occurred as the 
drain regime was biased to make E0 line up with 
 6
Table I concludes the comparisons of the 
PVCR performance of this work with the latest 
results on other compound semiconductor 
devices [3]-[6]. The proposed HRT-FET device 
has demonstrated, to our knowledge, the best 
PVCR performance in excess of 960 at room 
temperature among compound semiconductor 
NDR devices. It has also exhibited the highest 
peak current density of 478 A/mm-cm2, 
equivalent to 66.9 A/cm2 with the gate width of 
140 µm, with excellent off-resonance 
performance as compared to others [3]-[6].  
Though extremely high PVCR value on the order 
of 105 was presented by Watanabe et al. [20], 
yet the significant CaF2-related defects during 
sample growth and incompatibility to 
semiconductor monolithic integration strongly 
limited its applications. On the other hand, 
device processing of this work is fully 
compatible to current compound semiconductor 
technology, making it suitable for application in 
monolithic MMIC’s. 
 
五、 結論 
In conclusion, a monolithic AlAs/InGaAs/ 
InGaP/GaAs heterostructure resonant tunneling 
field-effect transistor has been successfully 
grown and fabricated. This letter reports 
three-terminal controllable NDR performance 
with a peak-to-valley current ratio in excess of 
960 at room temperature, with high peak current 
density of 478 A/mm-cm2 and excellent 
off-resonance characteristics. In addition, the 
proposed HRT-FET device is suitable for the 
MMIC circuit applications
