Abstract 
   By using a pilot sample from a selected time-slot in a time-domain orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM) block, we present a simple maximum-likelihood (ML) scheme for 
frequency tracking in OFDM systems over frequency-selective channels. The frequency offset 
estimator thus obtained is found to become unbiased and its mean square error (MSE) will 
approach the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is increased. Moreover, 
the selection of time slot can determine a trade-off between tracking accuracy and tracking range.

  In view of (4), the range of estimation is pN 2/±  (The

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In our simulations, we choose the length of one OFDM block 
or the number of subcarriers to be 64=N . We take a 
frequency-selective channel with an exponential power profile 
and a dispersion length of 16 sample units. Since after coarse 
frequency synchronization, the residual frequency offset will 
be within half the subcarrier spacing, we shall choose 63=p  
for maximum estimation accuracy while maintaining the 
estimation range around 5.0± . The performance of our 
frequency estimator is shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 respectively 
for a small frequency offset ( 05.0=δ ) and a large frequency 
offset ( 5.0=δ ). In both figures, the top plot of (a) gives the 
estimator variance (MSE and CRB) vs. pSNR  curves and the 
bottom plot of (b) presents the estimator bias ( δδ −]ˆ[E ) vs. 
pSNR  curve. Averaging over 1,000 simulation runs is 
performed to produce all results. Both figures show that the

英文： 
An efficient pilot-aided maximum-likelihood (ML)-based algorithm is 
proposed for combined frequency tracking and channel estimation for 
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Our 
contribution is the novel idea of applying a linear minimum mean square 
error (LMMSE) combiner to optimally combine frequency offset estimators 
obtained from time slot samples over the time-domain OFDM block. Then, 
by alternatively updating the LMMSE frequency estimator and the ML 
channel estimator through adaptive iterations, we successfully avoid the use 
of a usually complex log-likelihood function while still achieve good 
convergence in obtaining the solution for the combined ML estimators. No 
approximation or simplification is needed to derive the combined 
estimation algorithm. Moreover, our ML estimators have variances or mean 
square errors (MSEs) tightly close to CRBs with a wide tracking range.
