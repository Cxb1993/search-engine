Abstract 
 
This research proposes a broadband 
CPW-to-rectangular waveguide power 
divider using the dipole slot antenna. The 
CPW-to-rectangular waveguide power 
divider using the dipole slot antenna, has a 
return loss larger than 15 dB and an insertion 
loss equal to 3.08~3.27 dB from 8 to 12.1 
GHz, which almost covers the whole X-band 
(8.2–12.4 GHz). And the phase difference 
between the two output ports is smaller than 
2.4°. Furthermore, in order to enhance the 
bandwidth, the dipole slot antenna is 
replaced by the bow-tie slot antenna. The 
CPW-to-rectangular waveguide power 
divider using the bow-tie slot antenna, has a 
return loss larger than 19 dB from 8 to 13 
GHz, which exceeds the X-band. The 
corresponding insertion loss in the X-band is 
equal to 3.05~3.29 dB and the phase 
difference between the two output ports is 
smaller than 2.29°. In order to verify our 
design, we fabricate and measure power 
dividers that use the dipole slot antenna or 
the bow-tie slot antenna. The measurement 
results of both power dividers are in good 
agreement with the simulation results.

二、緣由與目的 
 
矩形波導是由中空金屬所構成，具有
阻絕外部雜訊、低損耗及高功率傳輸的優
點，因此，被廣泛地應用在高品質因素的
微波元件上。近年來，由於印刷電路製程
技術成熟且製作成本低，因此，平面傳輸
線被廣泛地用來整合積體電路、低雜訊放
大器、震盪器及表面黏着元件，以組成多
工能且縮小化的射頻模組。為了整合上述
兩種不同傳輸結構所形成的電路模組，許
多學者提出各種平面傳輸線至矩形波導轉
接，包含微帶線至矩形波導轉接[1]–[4]、
共面波導至矩形波導轉接[5]–[12]、槽線至
矩形波導轉接[13]。 
除了單一轉接電路之外，許多學者提
出平面傳輸線至矩形波導功率分配器，來
整合平面傳輸線與矩形波導所組成的電路

為了驗證這個結果，我們仿效圖六將
圖十的共面波導至矩形波導功率分配器接

四、結果與討論 
 
本研究使用偶極槽線天線，來實現寬
頻的共面波導至矩形波導功率分配器，其
返回損耗大於 15 dB 的頻段涵蓋 8~12.1 
GHz ，幾乎涵蓋整個 X-band (8.2-12.4 
GHz)；在這個頻段之內，其插入損耗都在
於 3.08 至 3.27 dB，並且輸出端埠 2 與端埠

為了增加這個轉接的頻寬，我們使用
領結型槽線天線取代偶極槽線天線，以形

Fig. 2.  Comparison between the simulated mode conversions of the full wave 
and model for the bended differential transmission lines using the right-angle 
bend. 
The dimensions for the bended differential transmission 
line using the right-angle bend shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b) are w 
= 1.75 mm, s = 0.75 mm, and l’ = 21.9948 mm. The substrate 
used is FR4 with a relative dielectric constant of εr = 4.3 and a 
thickness of h = 1.5 mm. Given the dimensions, the structure in 
Fig. 1(a) is simulated by Momentum and the simulation result 
is then used to extract the equivalent circuit parameters. The 
equivalent circuit parameters can be extracted through the 
procedures mentioned in the literature [4] where the extracted 
parameters are listed in Table I. 
B. Differential-to-Common Mode Conversion 
In order to investigate the differential-to-common mode 
conversion, Fig. 1(a) is simulated by Momentum to extract the 
four-port S parameters and then the four-port S parameters are 
converted to the mixed-mode S parameters [5]. The frequency 
responses of differential-to-common mode conversions for the 
bended differential transmission line using the right-angle bend 
shown in Fig. 1(a) and that using the equivalent circuit model 
shown in Fig. 1(c) are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen from 
Fig. 2, the simulation result of Fig. 1 (a) is in good agreement 
with the simulation result of Fig. 1(c), and therefore the 
equivalent circuit model can properly represent the right-angle 
bend. Besides, it can be seen that the simulated differential-to-
common mode conversions for Fig. 1(a) and Fig.1(c) are 
smaller than –5.47 dB and –6.07 dB, respectively, from DC to 
6 GHz. 
III. BENDED DIFFERENTIAL TRANSMISSION LINE USING 
COMPENSATION INDUCTANCE 
A. Design Rules 
In order to eliminate the common-mode noise, the bended 
differential transmission line using the compensation 
inductance is proposed. By simply increasing the value of the 
inductance L12 in Fig. 1(c) to a value denoted by the 
compensation inductance, the common-mode noise can be 
greatly reduced. The value of the compensation inductance L12 
can be calculated by 
                              212 34 33 112 ( )oddL L Z C C                           (1) 
where L12 is the self inductance of the inner wire after 
compensation; L34 is the self inductance of the outer wire; C11 
and C22 are the capacitances between the inner wire and the 
ground; Zodd denotes the odd-mode impedance of the coupled 
Tx line. Equation (1) is derived by simply rearranging the 
formula for acquiring the compensation capacitance since the 
technique of using the compensation inductance is dual to the 
technique of using the compensation capacitance [4]. 
Given the equivalent circuit parameters of the right-angle 
bend, i.e. L34 = 3.738 nH, C11 = 0.275 pF, C33 = 0.449 pF, and 
Zd = 49.7699 Ω as shown in Table I, the value of the 
compensation inductance L12 is calculated to be 4.600 nH 
through equation (1). 
                              (a)                                                           (b)

line shown in Fig. 4 is now simulated by using ADS where the 
driving source is a differential step function having a 0.5 volt 
amplitude with a rise time of 40 ps. The driving source is 
acquired from the waveform generated by the time-domain 
reflectometry (TDR) TEK/CSA8000 after the waveform has 
passed through two cables. It is noted that this driving source 
will include the cable loss, which will closely approximate the 
real source used in the measurement. The simulated TDT 
common-mode noise for the bended differential transmission 
line using the short-circuited coupled line is shown in Fig. 7 
where the magnitude of the TDT common-mode noise is 0.02 
V. Also shown in Fig. 7 is the simulated TDT common-mode 
noise for the bended differential transmission line using the 
right-angle bend, which is 0.068 V. 
In order to verify the simulation result, Fig. 6 is measured 
in the time domain with TEK/CSA8000 where the 
measurement result is also shown in Fig. 7. As can be seen 
from Fig. 7, the simulation and measurement results are in 
good agreement where the magnitude of the measured TDT 
common-mode noise is 0.028 V. It is noted that the bended 
differential transmission line using the short-circuited coupled 
line can greatly reduce the differential-to-common mode 
conversion from –5.47 dB to –14.75 dB and the common-
mode noise by (0.068 – 0.02)/0.068 = 70.5% as compared 
with the bended differential transmission line using the right-
angle bend. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In order to eliminate the common-mode noise, a new 
bended differential transmission line using a short-circuited 
coupled line is proposed. The differential-to-common mode 
conversion for the bended differential transmission lines using 
the short-circuited coupled line is below –14.75 dB, which is 
much smaller than that for the bended differential transmission 
line using the right-angle bend. Besides, the TDT common-
mode noise for the bended differential transmission line using 
the short-circuited coupled line is 0.02 V, which has 70.5% 
reduction as compared with that of the bended differential 
transmission line using the right-angle bend. 
Verifications are done both in the frequency and time 
domains where the measurement results are in good agreement 
with simulation results. Therefore, it is verified that the 
proposed structure could efficiently reduce mode conversion 
and the TDT common-mode noise at the receiving end.

B. CB-CPW to SIW transition using quarter-wavelength 
transformer 
The quarter-wavelength transformer can then be 
implemented with a CB-CPW to SIW transition operating in 
S-band (2.60–3.95 GHz) as shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen 
from Fig. 3, the characteristic impedance Z0 is realized as a 
52.4-Ω CB-CPW; the quarter-wavelength transformer is 
realized as a 14.95-Ω quarter-wavelength CB-CPW; the load 
impedance RL is realized as a 4.3-Ω SIW. The reason why SIW 
is chosen to realize RL is that since the load impedance RL is so 
low, it is not easily to be implemented with CB-CPW. 
The substrate used to realize these circuits is RT 5880, 
which has a thickness of 0.508 mm and a relative dielectric 
constant of 2.2. The dimensions of the CB-CPW to SIW 
transition using the quarter-wavelength transformer are listed 
in Table I. Besides, the diameter of the via is 0.3 mm and the 
distance between adjacent vias is 0.3 mm, which is limited by 
the available fabrication process. 
Fig. 3 is then simulated by using the commercial software 
HFSS and the resulting frequency responses of the return and 
insertion losses are shown in Fig. 4. As can be seen from Fig. 4, 
the 15-dB fractional bandwidth of the return loss is 25.86% in 
which the corresponding insertion loss is 0.2 dB. The center 
frequency f0 slightly move from 3.12 GHz to 3.48 GHz. 
III. TRANSITION USING STEPPED-IMPEDANCE RESONATOR 
TRANSFORMER 
A. Stepped-impedance resonator transformer 
Reconsider Fig. 1 and assume that the characteristic 
impedance Z0 is greater than the load impedance RL. In order to 
miniaturize the quarter-wavelength transformer, the 
quarter-wavelength transformer shown in Fig. 1 is replaced 
with a combination of low impedance line Zl with electrical 
length θl and high impedance line Zh with electrical length θh 
as shown in Fig. 5. In such an arrangement, Z0 will be much 
greater than Zl, and Zh will be much greater than RL.  
In the design of the multi-section transformer, Γ0 is set 
equal to Γ2 in order to have a symmetrical structure [9]. By 
enforcing Γ0 = Γ2, we have 
 
0h l LZ Z Z R .                                (1) 
 
Since Z0 is much greater than Zl and Zh is much greater than 
RL, Fig. 5 can be approximated as an SIR where the minimum 
electrical length of the SIR resonator θT = θh + θl can be 
achieved by enforcing 
 
-1tan /h l l hZ Z                                  (2) 
 
[8]. Given the load impedance RL = 4.3 Ω and the characteristic 
impedance Z0 = 52 Ω, the low impedance Zl and high 
impedance Zh can be calculated for various total electrical

SIW transition using the quarter-wavelength transformer 
whereas the fractional bandwidth of the CB-CPW to SIW 
transition using the SIR has only 2.09% reduction from that of 
the CB-CPW to SIW transition using the quarter-wavelength 
transformer. 
IV. MEASUREMENT RESULT 
In order to verify the simulation results, two CB-CPW to 
SIW transitions using the quarter-wavelength transformer are 
connected back-to-back and fabricated as shown in Fig. 9. The 
dimensions for this back-to-back transition are the same as 
those mentioned in Table I. The length of the Lback1 in Fig. 9 is 
equal to 38.1 mm. The fabricated circuit is then measured with 
Anritsu 37347C VNA after it is calibrated with the TRL 
calibration kit. The measured insertion and return losses are 
shown in Fig. 10 along with the simulated insertion and return 
losses. As can be seen from Fig. 10, both the simulation and 
measurement results are in good agreement for both the 
insertion and return losses, which therefore verify our design. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an SIR transformer is proposed to miniaturize 
the quarter-wavelength transformer. In order to demonstrate 
the capability of the SIR transformer, the SIR transformer is 
implemented with the CB-CPW to SIW transition using the 
SIR transformer. The CB-CPW to SIW transition using the 
SIR transformer yields a 50% area reduction and a 2.09% 
15-dB fractional bandwidth reduction as a tradeoff as 
compared with the CB-CPW to SIW transition using the 
quarter-wavelength transformer. In order to verify our 
simulation results, we fabricate a back-to-back CB-CPW to 
SIW transition using the quarter-wavelength transformer 
where the measurement results are in good agreement with the 
simulation results.
