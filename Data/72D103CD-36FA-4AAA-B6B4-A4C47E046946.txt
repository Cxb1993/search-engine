III. Vibration Analysis
For the free vibration analysis of an undamped structure, the
equation of motion of the structure can be written in the following
eigenvalue expression (Cook et al. [23]):
Mf Dg  KfDg  f0g (7)
where fDg is a vector for the unrestrained nodal degrees of freedom,
f Dg an acceleration vector, M the mass matrix of the structure, K
the stiffness matrix of the structure, and f0g a zero vector. Because
fDg undergoes harmonic motion, we can express
fDg  f Dg sin!t; f Dg  !2f Dg sin!t (8)
where the f Dg vector contains the amplitudes of fDg vector. Then
Eq. (7) can be written in an eigenvalue expression as
K  !2Mf Dg  f0g (9)
When a laminated plate is subjected to compressive force, initial
stresses are generated in the plate. Consequently, the stiffness matrix
K in Eq. (9) can be separated into two matrices as
K  KL  K  (10)
The KL is the traditional linear stiffness matrix and K  is a
geometric stress stiffness matrix due to the initial stresses. Then
Eq. (9) becomes
KL  K   !2Mf Dg  f0g (11)
The preceding equation is an eigenvalue expression. If f Dg is not a
zero vector, we must have
jKL  K   !2Mj  0 (12)
InABAQUS, a subspace iteration procedure (ABAQUS, Inc. [21]) is
used to solve for the natural frequency !, and the eigenvectors (or
vibration modes) f Dg. The obtained smallest natural frequency
(fundamental frequency) is then the objective function for
maximization.
IV. Golden Section Method
We begin by presenting the golden section method (Vanderplaats
[19];Haftka et al. [20]) for determining theminimumof the unimodal
function F, which is a function of the independent variable X. It is
assumed that lower bound XL and upper bound XU on X are known,
and the minimum can be bracketed (Fig. 2). In addition, we assume
that the function has been evaluated at both bounds, and the
corresponding values are FL and FU. Now we can pick up two
intermediate points X1 and X2 such that X1 < X2 and evaluate the
function at these two points to provide F1 and F2. Because F1 is
greater thanF2, nowX1 forms a new lower bound, andwe have a new
set of bounds X1 and XU. We can now select an additional point X3
for which we evaluate F3. It is clear that F3 is greater thanF2, and so
X3 replacesXU as the new upper bound. Repeating this process, we
can narrow the bounds to whatever tolerance is desired.
To determine the method for choosing the interior points
X1; X2; X3; . . ., we pick the values of X1 and X2 to be symmetric
about the center of the interval and satisfying the following
expressions:
X U  X2  X1  XL (13)
X1  XL
XU  XL 
X2  X1
XU  X1 (14)
Let  be a number between 0 and 1. We can deﬁne the interior point
X1 and X2 to be
X 1  1  XL  XU (15a)
X 2  XL  1  XU (15b)
Substituting Eqs. (15a) and (15b) into Eq. (14), we obtain
2  3  1 0 (16)
Solving the preceding equation, we obtain   0:38197. The ratio
1  =  1:61803 is the famous “golden section” number. For a
problem involving the estimation of the maximum of a one-variable
function F, we need only minimize the negative of the function, that
is, minimize -F.

for square laminated plates with or without a central circular cutout.
Figure 9b shows that the optimal fundamental frequency! decreases
with the increase in axial compressive forceN. However, the optimal
fundamental frequency! tends to increase with the increasing of the
cutout size especially when the axial compressive force N is lower.
This phenomenon that the fundamental frequencies increase with the
increasing of the cutout size might seem strange. However, previous
research did show that introducing a hole into a composite structure
does not always reduce the fundamental natural frequency and, in
some instances, may increase its fundamental natural frequency (Hu
and Ho [13], Hu and Juang [14], Hu and Ou [15], Hu and Tsai [16],
Lee et al. [26], Ramakrishna et al. [27]). This is because that the
fundamental natural frequency of an ordinary composite structure is
not only inﬂuenced by cutout but also inﬂuenced by material
orthotropy, boundary condition, structural geometry, and their
interactions.
Figure 10 shows the optimal ﬁber angle  and the associated
optimal fundamental frequency ! vs the d=b ratio for 	=90=02s
laminated plates with ﬁxed boundary conditions. From Fig. 10a we
can see that for a laminated plate with small cutout size (say
d=b < 0:3), the optimal ﬁber angle is close to 0 deg when there is no
axial compressive force. However, when axial compressive force
exists, the optimal ﬁber angle is close to 90 deg. For a laminated plate
with a large cutout size (say d=b 0:6), the optimal ﬁber angle is
close to 45 deg whether the axial compressive force exists or not.
Figure 10b again shows that the optimal fundamental frequency !
increases with the decreasing of axial compressive force andwith the
increasing of the cutout size. Comparing Fig. 10 with Fig. 9, we can
also see that the boundary condition has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
optimal ﬁber angle and the optimal fundamental frequency of the
square laminated plate with a central circular cutout.
VI. Conclusions
Based on the numerical results of this investigation, the following
conclusions may be drawn:
1. The boundary conditions have signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the opti-
mal fundamental frequency and the associated optimal ﬁber
orientation of the laminated plates with or without cutouts and are
subjected to axial compressive forces.
2. Generally, the axial compressive force has a signiﬁcant inﬂu-
ence on the optimal fundamental frequency of the laminated plates
with or without cutouts. Under the same a=b ratio, the optimal
fundamental frequency decreases with the increasing of the
compressive force.
3. For rectangular laminated plates subjected to axial compressive
forces and with small aspect ratio, the axial compressive forceN has
very little inﬂuence on the optimal ﬁber angle  of the laminated
plates and the optimal fundamental frequency ! decreases with the
increasing of the a=b ratio. However, when the aspect ratio of the
plate is large, the axial compressive forces do have a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the optimal ﬁber angle of the laminated plates, and the
optimal fundamental frequency tends to approach a constant value.
4. The central circular cutout has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
optimal ﬁber angle of the rectangular laminate plates with simply
supported ends. In addition, it has signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
optimal ﬁber angle of the laminate plates with ﬁxed ends only when
the axial compressive force is large.
5. The central circular cutout has very little inﬂuence on the opti-
mal fundamental frequency of the rectangular laminate plates with
simply supported ends or with ﬁxed ends.
6. The axial compressive force has no inﬂuence at all on the
optimal ﬁber angle of the square laminated plates when the diameter
of the cutout is large. However, when the diameter of the cutout is
small, the axial compressive force does have some inﬂuences on the
optimal ﬁber angle of the laminated plates.
7. For square laminated plates subjected to compressive force, the
optimal fundamental frequency tends to increase with the increasing
of the cutout size especially when the axial compressive force N is
lower.
