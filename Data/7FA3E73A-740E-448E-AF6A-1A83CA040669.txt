The Development of Customer Value Model for Self-Service Technology in 
Retailing Industry by the Application of Mean-End Chain theory 
Abstract 
   The goal of conducting marketing strategy in retailing industry is to transfer operating direction and 
resource for creating customer value. In this study, the purpose is to develop the customer value chain for 
self-service technologies (SSTs) in retailing industry which can be used to explore complex interactions 
among the customer attributes, decision consequence, and customer values. The mean-end chain (MEC) 
theory will be applied to develop hierarchical value map (HVM) and explore the relationship between 
customer value toward SSTs in retailing industry. Eight types of customer value proposed by Holbrook 
(1996) and customer value developed from last year project (NSC 96-2221-E-327-009) will be combined 
to explore customer value attributes. 
This study adopts the uses content analysis to collect data and soft laddering approach to interview 
22 SSTs customers. The key path was found that the element “ease of use” directly linked with the 
“time-saving” and directly linked with the “convenience in life” in SSTs customer value map. Another 
finding was found that the element of “safety” directly linked with the “trust” is important path for the 
customers in SSTs. This path is related to the attribute layer of the elements of “brand evaluation” and 
“function fully and steadily.” In light of major findings, this study sets theoretical and strategic 
implications for researchers and practitioners.

2. Literature Review 
2.1. Means-End Chain theory and Hierarchical value map 
Means-end chain (MEC) theory facilitates the understanding of the customer’s choice and it has 
been developed to understand how customer link attributes of products with particular consequences and 
how these consequences satisfy their personal values. In MEC theory, product attributes as means through 
which customers obtain valued ends. Indeed, customers choose products yield particular consequences 
including benefits of product-use to achieve desired values (Reynolds and Gutman, 1984). The three 
levels: attributes, consequences and values (A-C-V) are postulated to be hierarchically structured in that 
attributes lead to consequences for producing value satisfaction. The consequences can be direct, indirect, 
physiological, psychological or sociological. Meanwhile, customers act so as to maximize the positive 
consequences and minimize the negative consequences (Gutman, 1982). 
The most popular method of analysis of laddering data, beyond question, is the hierarchical value map 
(HVM). Laddering interviewing is a qualitative interviewing technique and follows a three-stage process 
(Reynolds and Gutman, 1988; Claeys et al., 1995). First, a content analysis is performed which leads to 
the construction of an important matrix. The matrix represents numbers of direct/indirect relationships 
between ACV. Second, a Hierarchical Value Map (HVM) is constructed which presents a graphical 
representation of a set of MEC as associations across levels of cognitive structure map. The HVM have 
the advantage of providing a well-organized summary of the information derived in the interviews. It 
consists of nodes and lines which connect these nodes. Third, the concepts are categorized into a smaller 
number of categories and the chains are pathways from one attribute to one value which well translate the 
means-end process of a large number of customers. The attributes, consequences and values form chains 
that are put into a HVM, depicting the cognitive or motivational decision structure of the consumer 
(Grunert and Grunert, 1995).  
 
2.2. Customer value  
Customer value has been studies under customer lifetime value, customer equity and customer 
profitability (Hwang, et al., 2004). Zeithaml (2000) pointed out that many works need to be done on 
identifying the value of current customers. Hwang, et al. (2004) tried to calculate customer value through 
current value, potential value and customer loyalty. Rare research has been conducted to construct the 
value theory of customer and defined variety meanings in order to apply in different field (Keeney, 2001; 
Hwang, et al. 2004). In particular, very few studies have used qualitative research methods (such as a case 
study) to collect data on the customer value and introduced into the retailing industry marketing. 
Holbrook (1996) proposed a framework to distinguish among eight key types of customer values that 
appear to deserve consideration in the analysis of customer behavior. The eight types refer to different 
aspects of consumption that have attracted the attention. The framework reflects three key dimensions of 
values: (1) Extrinsic versus Intrinsic, (2) Self-Oriented versus Other-Oriented and (3) Active versus 
Reactive. Then, treat each of the dimensions just as a dichotomy and combining these three dichotomies 
into a 2 x 2 x 2 cross-classification and produced the eight types (efficiency, play, excellence, aesthetics, 
status, ethics, esteem and spirituality) of customer values.

3.3 Coding 
The coding was carried out by three graduate students who were familiar with the means-end chain 
approach and related processes. Before the encoding took place, the relationship between the SSTs 
attributes and customer value was first examined, in order that those doing the coding would be able to 
fully understand the customers’ adoption tendencies. In addition, in order to focus on those aspects of 
coding that were easily confused, it was necessary to ensure that the coders were familiar with the coding 
rules. After the coding was completed, the consequences were compared. If the coders failed to agree 
with each other, they then needed to discuss the issues on which they disagreed, with each coder 
explaining his or her understanding of the meaning of the themes as well as the reasons for the coding, in 
order that a consensus could be reached for the coding. Based on the attributes, consequences and values 
transmitted by those interviewed, a total of 375 relationship chains were obtained. 
 
3.4 Reliability Analysis     
This study adopted the interjudge reliability approach in order to test the reliability of the sample. 
Based on this approach, the student coders each measured the reliability of the items in accordance with 
the standards of the intercoder agreement. For the content of the same interview, all three coders 
performed the classification and intercoder reliability is 0.931, 0.913 and 0.913. Wimmer and Dominick 
(1994) recommended that the reliability should be above 0.90, in order to comply with the most basic 
requirements. In this study, the reliability of content analysis is 0.971, a level that people are clearly 
willing to accept. 
 
4. Result 
The elements within the HVM were established based on the contents of the answers given in the 
interviews, while the lines linking these elements were based on the relationships listed in the implication 
matrix, and the key elements for different purposes were listed in the hierarchical map (Reynolds and 
Gutman, 1988). In order to avoid drawing all of the key elements, which would have resulted in the 
hierarchical map becoming excessively complicated, cutoff values were established where it was decided 
that only if the links or relationships exceeded a certain number would the line in question be drawn on 
the hierarchical map. In this study we adopted a trial and error approach and finally ended up with a 
cutoff value of 3, so that any cases for which there were three or less direct and indirect relationships 
were not included in the hierarchical map. The SSTs customer value map is presented in Figure 1. 
 
4.1 Analysis of key elements 
Of the key elements for the attribute connotations, it was the A02 “ease of use” element that 
accounted for the highest share (13.3%), having been referred to 17 times. The elements with the second 
order were A05 “client-oriented facilities” and A13 “function fully and steadily,” which accounted for 
11.8% and 10.2%, having been referred to 15 and 13 times. This finding indicated that familiarity, simply 
and variety functions with the SSTs are key influences the customer’ adoption. In addition, A04 
“promptly” and A07 “price advantage” are also important elements for the customers considerate, having 
been referred to 10 and 12 times. Thus, it shows that the speed of transaction and price favorable more 
will lead the customers repurchase or reuse. Among the key elements for the consequence connotations, it 
   - 8 -
linked with the consequences layer C04 “safety” 10 times. However, the element C04 “safety” in the 
consequences layer was strongly directly linked with the objective layer V01 “trust” 13 times. Obviously, 
the customers will choose the popular brand that is more safety and reliability to protect themself when 
they use SSTs. Thus, safety and trust also are important elements in the customer feelings. Finally, the 
element A07 “price advantage” in the attributes layer was directly linked with the consequences layer C06 
“cost-saving” 10 times. The element C06 “cost-saving” in the consequences layer was directly linked 
with the objective layer V06 “convenience in life” and V07 “satisfaction” 6, 7 times. This finding implied 
that the lower price in SSTs will let the customers are satisfaction and willingness to return to use others 
service. Price in the SSTs seems to be sensitive relatively for the customers.  
 
5. Discussion 
   The purpose of this study was to gain some insights into SSTs customer value. This study applies the 
means-end chain model to discuss the SSTs customer value chain. The key elements are addressed on 
“ease of use,” “time-saving” and “convenience in life,” which are the important characters in SSTs and 
reflect the customer feelings when they contact the service. These findings are in accordance with the 
prior literature. The key path was found that the element A02 “ease of use” directly linked with the C01 
“time-saving” and directly linked with the V06 “convenience in life”. This finding implied that the SSTs 
customer value was derived from the customers cost less and less time to produce more and more 
performance and achieve their goal as soon as possible. The value for the customers is to take the more 
convenience in their life and willingness to return. Therefore, in the practice, manager should be to do it 
in the two ways, which is addressed on the easy and clear to use and achieve the customer goal in short 
time in SSTs. 
    Another interesting finding was found that the element of “safety” directly linked with the “trust” is 
important path for the customers in SSTs. On the other words, the better service provider (i.e. brand) and 
improve the imperfection in SSTs will raise consumers’ retention to use and maintain customer 
relationship, such as the speed of system loading, technology steadily, information transmission security 
etc. Therefore, build up the customers’ confidence in SSTs is importantly for the practitioners. The SSTs 
customer value chain can help the manager to make the decision in SSTs market, which is propose the 
product and advertisement strategy based on the A-C-V chain for the firms. Furthermore, practitioners 
could be make the marketing strategy clearly with the questionnaire data and statistic analysis. 
Although we availed ourselves of the professional experience of three graduate student coders who 
interacted with each other to do the coding, if one wishes to be more rigorous, using a focus group or 
panel discussion will further corroborate the results. In addition, future direction could be demonstrate 
and empirical our results and the value model could be simulated and validated by system dynamics 
which can simulate the dynamic complex questions and interactions among customer attributes, decision 
consequence and customer values. Furthermore, the statistic of cluster analysis could be applied in our 
result to segment the similar customer groups, which is make the suitable strategies for the practitioners 
and extent our theoretical contribution for the researchers in future direction.

Convenience stores (CVSs) are an integral part of the retail industry. Merchandises are 
circulated from suppliers and CVSs to consumers. Therefore, if the goods which consumers 
desire are always out of stock, no matter how good the service, customer satisfaction will be 
hard to be improved. CVSs could provide differentiated service by offering a diversity of 
fresh foods. Due to the increasing number of customers, CVSs strive to earn market share. 
The speed of product development in which 2003 far surpassed the year before and quality 
control is also a key to improving competitive advantages. 
The Point of Sale (POS) system provides the information analysis ability and can be used to 
analyze consumers’ purchasing behavior as well as forecast needs. Therefore, managers of 
CVSs improve their revenues based on these data. No matter whether in the urban area, 
suburb or mountainous area, own the different characteristics of business circles. Therefore, 
business circles are important influencing factors. As Franchise Chains grow new operators 
increasingly join the business.  However, it is difficult to train ordering operators in the short 
time. Therefore, some CVSs run out of stock and some may always order too large quantities. 
Only control each order precisely can meet customers’ need. Therefore, how to control the 
order and stock of CVSs has become one of the important issues in the management of CVSs. 
Due to the strong competition that exists today, most manufacturing organizations are in a 
continuous effort for increasing their profits and reducing their costs. Accurate sales 
forecasting is certainly an inexpensive way to meet the aforementioned goals, since this leads 
to improved customer service, reduced lost sales and product returns and more efficient 
production planning. Especially for the food industry, successful sales forecasting systems can 
be very beneficial, due to the short shelf-life of many food products and the importance of the 
product quality which is closely related to human health [1].  
The purpose of this research is to discuss and develop a mechanism for controlling the order 
and managing the stock for CVSs. The theory of the buyer and seller exchanging system 
proposed by Kotler was modified to include the theory of consolidating loop structure. The
「Ordinary day and holiday moving average method」 and 「Back-Propagation Neural 
Network」were proposed and tested based on the operating characteristics of business circle 
and sale forecasting.  The method can be used to improve the ordering and discarding rate 
for achieving the goal of ordering the right items in the right amount.  The result of the

Recently, the number of Convenience Store (CVS) increases dramatically and its business 
operation is facing various competitive environments in Taiwan. Sales forecasting of daily 
fresh foods of CVS is highly complex due to the influence of internal and external 
environments. However, reliable sales forecasting can improve the quality of decision making 
and increase its competitiveness. Therefore, in order to improve the enterprise’s 
competitiveness, the manager should be able to make correct decisions based on the available 
information, and “forecasting” is viewed as an important part before decision making.  
Forecasting of the future demand is central to the planning and operation of retail industry. 
Sales forecasting are essential inputs for decision activities in various functional areas such as 
marketing, sales, and production. The training data have to satisfy four assuming in regression 
analysis: (1) normality and resembled variation, (2) independent for each data raw, (3) linear. 
(4) error-average is 0. [1] With the increasing usage of statistics and probability requirements 
for forecasting technique have become more critical. As technology requirements increase, so 
does demand for more exactness and efficiency. A growing number of research studies are 
now available to shed some light on these two independently via computing with complex 
statistics or algorithms; but these forecasting systems must deal with the constraints including 
[2]: 
 Large number of items for training 
 Substitution of most of the items for each collection subjectively 
 Long lead time of considerations of producing and planning of sourcing at a 
mid-term horizon 
 Influence of many explanatory variables. These factors can be: weather data, 
holiday, marketing action, promotions, fashion, or economic environment. 
Because of these constraints, there are more and more researchers tend to use AI forecasting 
models to deal with forecasting problems [3]. These models all possess fault tolerant ability 
and high-speed computing ability. The traditional BPNN approaches include some limitations. 
During the BPNN training one of the limitations is trainer must input a lot of data for training 
set. On the other hand, the training cost is wasted while the next incremental data add to the 
model. Like a data mining technique, how to reuse the knowledge we found before is this 
study focus on. Therefore, the development of a model which can deal with the short-term 
sales forecasting and the uncertainty as well as the complex relationship between data for
