be presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
design. Finally, Section 4 gives the conclusions.
2. Unknown input observer for slowly-
varying inputs
Consider a linear discrete-time system subject to
unknown input excitations,
x(k + 1) = Ax(k) +Gd(k) (1)
y(k) = Cx(k)
where x(k) ∈ Rn is the unknown system state, y(k) ∈
Rm the measured system output, and d(k) ∈ Rm un-
known input. The objective is to design an unknown
input observer to simultaneously estimate the system
state and the unknown input from the output signal. In
order for this problem to be feasible, the input dimen-
sion must be no greater than the output dimension. For
simplicity, it is assumed that they are equal. It will be
assumed temporarily in this section that the unknown
input is slowly time-varying with respect to some time
scale NT , where T is the sampling time of the discrete
system, and N is an integer to be specified later. Notice
that the system matrix A may be stable or unstable. In
the latter case, the system state will become unbounded
asymptotically.
To start with the unknown input observer design, one
needs to re-parameterize the system dynamics under the
following assumption.
A1. The open-loop system matrix A is nonsingular;
that is, A−1 exists.
Let the present time instant be k. It follows from
the system dynamics (1) that the previous time system
state x(j), j ∈ [k−N, k− 1], relates to the present time
system state x(k) through the following relationship:
x(j) = Aj−kx(k)−
k−1∑
i=j
Aj−i−1Gd(i), j ∈ [k −N, k − 1].
The above equation represents a backward evolution
(j < k) of the system dynamics (1). From this equation,
the previous time output y(j) relates to the present time
system state x(k) as follows,
y(j) = CAj−kx(k)−
k−1∑
i=j
CAj−i−1Gd(i), (2)
j ∈ [k −N, k − 1]
In the above equation, the previous time output data
y(j) is available, but the present time state x(k) and
the unknown input sequence d(i) are all unknown and
need to be estimated. For easiness of treatment, one as-
sumes for the moment that the unknown input is slowly
time-varying with respect to the time scale NT in the
following sense.
A2. The unknown input d(i) in (2) is slowly time-
varying in the sense that it remains approximately con-
stant during the time interval i ∈ [k −N, k].
The above assumption implies that
d(i) = d(k) + ²(i), ²(i) ≈ 0, i ∈ [k −N, k], (3)
where ²(i) represents the error resulting from the slowly-
varying assumption, and is close to zero according to
assumption A2. From (3), a linear regression form can
be derived from (2),
y(j) = CAj−kx(k)− (
k−1∑
i=j
CAj−i−1G)d(k) + ²1(i)(4)
= Φ(j)θ(k) + ²1(j), j ∈ [k −N, k − 1]
where the known regressor Φ(j) and unknown parameter
θ(k) are defined as
Φ(j) =
[
CAj−k, −∑k−1i=j CAj−i−1G ] ,(5)
θ(k) =
[
x(k)
d(k)
]
∈ R(n+m)×1,
and
²1(j) = −
k−1∑
i=j
CAj−i−1G²(i) ≈ 0, (6)
is close to zero according to assumption A2. Note that
equation (4) holds only for j ∈ [k −N, k − 1]; however,
by defining Φ(k) = [C, 0], it is found that equation (4)
also holds for j = k with ²1(k) = 0.
The above re-parameterization has led to a linear re-
gression form in (4) with time-varying and unknown
θ(k), which contains the unknown present time state
x(k) and unknown input d(k). Since the index j holds
only for finite values from k−N to k, one will resort to
a batch formula instead of a recursive formula to esti-
mate θ(k). In order to estimate θ(k), the regressor Φ(j)
must satisfy a so-called persistent excitation condition
[16] that the square matrix
P =
k∑
j=k−N
Φ(j)TΦ(j) ∈ R(n+m)×(n+m), (7)
be positive definite. To fulfill this condition, one needs
the following assumption,
2
matrix P =
∑k
j=k−N Φ(j)
TΦ(j) has a large condition
number. In this case, small ²(i) and hence small ²1(i)
can create large estimation error ²2(k) in (11). A dis-
cussion on when the matrix P become ill-conditioned
with a large condition number will be given in the next
section.
3. Unknown input observer for more gen-
eral inputs
In the previous section, an unknown input ob-
server is successfully constructed for the system (1)
when the unknown input d(k) is slowly time-varying in
the sense of assumption A2. In this section, the assump-
tion A2 will be relaxed to accommodate more general
inputs such as those that are fast time-varying.
A2’. The unknown input d(i) in (2) can be approxi-
mately curve-fitted by a polynomial of order p ≥ 1 for
i ∈ [k −N, k].
Under the assumption A2’, the unknown input d(i) in
(2) for i ∈ [k −N, k] can be expressed as
d(i) = hp(k)(i− k)p + . . .
+ h1(k)(i− k) + h0(k) + ²c(i),
²c(i) ≈ 0, i ∈ [k −N, k], (12)
where k is the present time instant, and i a past time
instant between [k − N, k], ²c(i) is the polynomial fit-
ting error, h0, · · · , hp are polynomial coefficients, which
are functions of the present time instant k. At each lo-
cal time interval [k − N, k], a local polynomial (12) is
used to approximate the unknown input, hence the co-
efficients hi’s are functions of time instant k. Note also
that a local time variable i−k, instead of the global time
variable k, is used in the polynomial expression. Since
i is confined to be in [k − N, k], the local time vari-
able i− k always remains bounded even when the time
index k evolves to infinity. This ensures that the regres-
sor vector Φc(j) introduced below will remain uniformly
bounded. If one uses a global polynomial for fitting the
input, the regressor vector Φc(j) will become unbounded
asymptotically.
From (2) and (12), a new linear regression form can
be obtained,
y(j) = CAj−kx(k)−
k−1∑
i=j
CAj−i−1G[hp(k)(i− k)p
+ . . .+ h1(k)(i− k) + h0(k)] + ²3(j)
= Φc(j)θc(k) + ²3(j), j ∈ [k −N, k − 1] (13)
where
²3(j) = −
k−1∑
i=j
CAj−i−1G²c(i) ≈ 0, (14)
is close to zero according to assumption A2’, and the
known regressor Φc(j) ∈ Rm×(n+m(p+1)) and unknown
parameter θc(k) ∈ Rn+m(p+1) are defined by
ΦTc (j) =

CAj−k
−∑k−1i=j CAj−i−1G(i− k)p
...
−∑k−1i=j CAj−i−1G
 ,(15)
θc(k) =

x(k)
hp(k)
...
h0(k)
 . (16)
Note that Equation (13) holds only for j ∈ [k −N, k −
1]. However, by defining Φc(k) = [C, 0, . . . , 0], one can
extend equation (13) to j = k.
With the new linear regression form (13), it is now
possible to obtain an estimation of the unknown θc(k)
based on the present and past output signal y(j), j ∈
[k −N, k]. For this purpose, the new regressor must be
”persistently exciting” [16] in the sense that the constant
square matrix
Pc =
k∑
j=k−N
Φc(j)TΦc(j) ∈ R(n+m(p+1))×(n+m(p+1)), (17)
is positive definite. This condition is guaranteed by the
following assumption.
A3’. The matrix Hc ∈ Rm(N+1)×(n+m(p+1)) is full rank;
that is, rank Hc = n+m(p+ 1), where
HTc =
CA−N · · · CA−1 C
−∑Nq=1 CA−qGΛp · · · −CA−1G(−1)p 0
−∑Nq=1 CA−qGΛ(p−1) · · · −CA−1G(−1)(p−1) 0
...
...
...
...
−∑Nq=1 CA−qG · · · −CA−1G 0
 , (18)
, where Λ = (q −N − 1) and the integer N ≥ n/m+ p.
Lemma 3 : Under the assumption A3’, the constant
square matrix Pc is positive definite.
Proof: By definition, Pc is positive semi-definite.
Hence, to prove that it is positive definite, one needs
to show that the quadratic form vTc Pcvc = 0 implies
4
Remark 4 : According to (19), if the unknown input
can be locally curve-fitted by a polynomial of order p,
one needs to use a sequence of past output signal y(j),
j ∈ [k − N, k], of length N + 1, where N ≥ n/m + p,
for estimation of the present time state x(k) and present
time input d(k). Further, a careful examination of (19)
and (21) shows that the obtained state estimate and
unknown input estimate are in fact moving averages of
the output sequence; that is,
xˆ(k) = (g0 + g1z−1 + · · ·+ gNz−N )y(k),
dˆ(k) = (f0 + f1z−1 + · · ·+ fNz−N )y(k), (22)
for some constant vectors gi’s and constant scalars fi’s.
Both gi and fi can be computed off-line before the op-
eration of the unknown input observer, as is done in the
simulation example below.
Example : Consider a stable system
x(k + 1) =
 0.8 0 02.1 −1.3 −0.6481
0 0.6481 0
x(k) +
 11
0
 d(k)
y =
[
0 0 1.543
]
x(k)
with initial condition x(0) = [5,−15, 10]T and unknown
input d(k) = cos(
√
6k). This stable system has a rela-
tive degree 2, and an unstable zero; hence, it is of non-
unity relative degree, and is non-minimum phase. Most
unknown input observer designs in the literature can not
be applied to such a system.
To test the proposed unknown input observer in The-
orem 4, a polynomial of order p = 2 is chosen to fit the
unknown input over local time intervals. N = n/m+p =
3/1+2 = 5 in (22); hence, N+1 = 6 steps of present and
past output signals are utilized to make the estimation.
The same design is then repeated for fitting polynomi-
als of order p = 3 and p = 4; the corresponding output
sequence length are 7 and 8 respectively. Figure 1 com-
pares the time history of the norm of state estimation
error for the three different designs (p = 2, 3, 4), and
Figure 2 compares the time history of the norm of the
input estimation error. It is seen that as the order of
fitting polynomial becomes higher, the better the esti-
mation results. For the best estimation result, both the
state and input estimation error can be down to the
order of 0.01.
