Abstract 
In order to solve the potential problems raised form the implementation of the 
chaos-based analog voice transmission system, in first year, using the sliding mode 
control technique, an adaptive control law is established which guarantees 
synchronization even when the parameters of the master and slave FHN neurons are 
fully unknown. Furthermore, the proposed synchronization scheme is then applied to 
the secure communication system. In second year, a particle swarm optimization 
(PSO)-based proportional -integral (PI) controller is proposed for synchronization of 
general chaotic systems. By using the PSO algorithm, optimal control gains in PI 
controller are derived. Then a chaotic secure communication system based on 
synchronized coupled uL &&  systems is implemented using basic electronic 
components. Both simulation results and the experimental results demonstrate the 
proposed PSO-based PI scheme’s success in the secure communication application.

一、緣由與目的 
 
Chaos is a random-like behavior which extremely depends on initial conditions of nonlinear 
dynamical systems. Recently, a few models of neurons have been developed to analyze the chaos of 
neurons in external stimulation [1-2]. The well-known FitzHung-Nagumo (FHN) model [3] is one 
of the simplified modifications of Hodgkin-Huxley model that describes the neuron dynamics and 
the general dynamics of excitable systems in different fields [4-6]. Meanwhile, the whole FHN has 
recently been practically implemented with an analog simulator [7] and the application of FHN will 
be more interesting in the future.  
On the other hand, the control and synchronization of chaotic systems in the last decade have 
become an important issue since the pioneering work of Pecora and Carroll in 1990 [8]. Chaos 
synchronization can be applied in the wide areas of physics and engineering systems such as power 
converters, chemical reactions, biological systems, information processing, especially for secure 
communication [9-13]. Many different control strategies have been developed for chaotic systems 
such as impulsive control [14-15], adaptive control [16-17], sliding mode control [18-19], feedback 
control [20], optimal control [21], digital redesign control [22], backstepping control [23-24], and 
so on.  
Based on past works [25-26], the purpose of this study in first year lies in the development of 
an adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) for synchronizing the state trajectories of FHN neurons 
subjected to unknown parameters and external disturbance. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is 
then applied to the secure communication system. A proportional-integral (PI) switching surface, 
which makes it easy to analyze the stability of the error dynamics in the sliding mode, is proposed. 
And then, an ASMC is derived to guarantee the occurrence of the sliding motion. In particular, the 
limitations of knowing system parameters and external disturbance in priori are also released due to 
this adaptive scheme.  
On the other hand, although many innovative technologies have been proposed to synthesis the 
3   
possible, and then synchronization of the master and slave chaotic systems is achieved. Moreover, 
as an application, the proposed PI control scheme is then applied to a chaotic secure communication 
system. The proposed PI controller is used to achieve the synchronization between the transmitter 
and receiver in communication systems.

Obviously, the synchronization problem is replaced by finding a suitable control scheme )(tu  
such that the stability of error dynamics (7) can be guaranteed. To achieve this goal, a PI switching 
surface )(tσ  is defined as follows: 
τττσ deaeatet t ))()(()()( 22 0 111 ++= ∫  (8)
where ℜ∈)(tσ  as well as 1a  and 2a  are design parameters which can be determined later. 
According to the results in [40-41], when the system operates in the sliding mode, it satisfies the 
following equations

Clearly, if the design parameters 01 >a and 02 >a  are selected, the characteristic polynomial

2)( ++=  has all its roots with negative real part and the stability of (11) is surely 
guaranteed, that is 0)(lim =∞→ tet  in the sliding mode.  
When a proper switching surface has been decided, it follows by designing an ASMC scheme 
to drive the error system trajectories onto the switching surface 0)( =tσ . To ensure the occurrence

Subsequently, as an application, the proposed ASMC synchronization scheme for 
FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons is then applied to secure communication system. The discontinuous 
component of (12) is now replaced by the following continuous approximation [42] for recovering 
the original message signal )(tm  correctly

defined as

which depicts the average behavior of the discontinuous component )(tu  and illustrates the effort 
necessary to keep the motion on the switching surface. 
From Theorem 2, the closed-loop error system (7) is asymptotically stable in the sliding mode, i.e.

If the magnitude of )(tm  is more greater than that of )(tρ , one obtains

Consequently, the hidden message signal )(tm  in the transmitter (master system (3)) with the 
external disturbance )(tρ  can be correctly recovered by the equivalent output signal )(tyeq  in the 
receiver (the controlled slave system). 
ii. Numerical example 
In this section, simulation results are presented to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of 
the proposed ASMC scheme. The system parameters are chosen as 10=r , 1=b , 1.0=A and 
129.0=f  to guarantee the chaos behavior for the master FHN neuron (4). A message signal )(tm  
with  27.0)( =≤ λtm  shown in Figure 1 is injected into (4) to verify the effectiveness of the 
message recovery. The external disturbance )(tρ  in slave system (5) satisfies 02.0)( =≤ δρ t .

Clearly, these results prove that the master and slave systems can be achieved synchronization even

secure communication can be correctly recovered in the slave system. 
iii. Conclusions 
An adaptive synchronization control scheme for FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons in external 
electrical stimulation is studied. Considering the fully unknown system parameters and external 
disturbance, an adaptive sliding mode controller has been proposed to ensure the synchronization 
between the master and the controlled slave FHN neurons. Furthermore, the proposed scheme has 
been also successfully applied to the secure communication system. Numerical simulations have 
verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

i. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the optimization problem 
Generally speaking, PSO algorithm commences with generating a random population which 
contains many individuals. Each individual, also called a particle, represents a set of possible 
solution to the optimization problem. During the calculation, the particle is affected by two factors 
when it is moving in space. One of the factors is the particle's current velocity iV . Another is the 
optimal point iX  where the particle has reached before. Where ][ ,,1, di2iii X,XXX L=  and 
][ ,,, di2i1ii V,VVV L=  denote the position and velocity of the i th particle in the d -dimensional 
search space, respectively. Note that during search process the resulted gain is constrained by the 
interval ],[ maxmin, XXX ji ∈ , dj ,,1K= . Each particle has its own best position (pbest) 
],,[ ,2,1, diiii PPPP L=  corresponding to the personal best objective value obtained. The global best 
particle (gbest) is denoted by ],,[ ,2,1, dgggg PPPP L= , which represents the best particle found in the 
entire swarm. The new velocity of each particle is calculated and updated by following equations. 
))(())(()()1( ,,22,,21,, kXPrckXPrckwVkV jijgjijijiji −+−+=+ ， dj ,2,1 L=     (26)
))(())(()()()1( ,,22,,11,,, kXPrckXPrckwVkXkX jijgjijijijiji −+−++=+ ， dj ,2,1 L=  (27)
where w  is called the inertia weight that controls the impact of the current velocity on the next 
velocity; 1c  and 2c  are the positive acceleration coefficients that pull each particle toward the 
individual best and global best positions, respectively. 1r  and 2r  are uniformly random numbers 
on the interval [0, 1]. 
In this paper, we extend PSO algorithm to decide the optimal gains in PI controller (24) for 
synchronization, and the procedure is summarized as follows: 
Step1:  Apply the QRS to initialize a population of particles with size S . The initial position (k=0) 
of the i -th particle is defined as follows:  
])0()0([)0( IiPii KKX = ， Si ,2,1 L=  
where )0(PiK , )0(IiK , are the components (PI gains) of each particle subjected to limited 
constraints in a population of size S . Swarm is an apparently disorganized population of 
13   
synchronization of uL &&  circuits, which are typical chaotic systems that have been thoroughly 
studied [43-44]. The uL &&  system is given by

where 361 =θ , 32 =θ and 203 =θ .  
As mentioned in [45], for directly implementing nonlinear uL &&  systems with electronic 
circuits, there exist a major difficulty, that is, the state variables of system (28) occupy a wide 
dynamic range with values that exceed reasonable power supply limits. However, this difficulty can 
be eliminated by a simple transformation of variables. By using an appropriate transformation of 
10/1 xxm = , 10/2 yxm = , and 10/3 zxm = , the uL && equations are transformed to

This system (29), which we refer to as the transmitter, can be more easily implemented

where mx&  and sx& denote the derivative of mx  and sx  with respect to time τ , respectively. K  
is a scaling factor, and 1≥>∞ K . Practical circuits of the chaotic master and slave systems 
supplied ± 15V in uL &&  circuits with 10000=K  are shown in Figure 10 and 11, respectively. In 
order to demonstrate the chaotic secure communication, we have masked the input message )(tm  
by the state 2sx  in the transmitter, and the masked signal is then sent to the receiver.  
Experimental results: Figure 12(a-f) shows the experimental results of synchronization between 
state mx  and state sx . Figure 13(a) shows the audio signal masked by 2mx . From Figure 12 and 
13(a), we can observe that the masked signal becomes chaotic and is quite different from the 
original signal. It is not easy to recovery the original signal from the transmitted signal except the 
synchronization between the transmitter and the receiver can be obtained. Figure 13(b) shows the 
recovered audio signal at the receiver side by the PI-based control for chaotic synchronization. The 
experimental results demonstrate that the secure communication is obtained through the proposed 
PSO-based PI control scheme. 
iv. Conclusions 
Based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a simple and successful PI 
controller has been proposed for synchronizing two chaotic systems. The PI controller gains can be 
directly obtained by solving specified optimization problems. Moreover, the proposed PSO-based 
PI scheme is then successfully applied to construct a secure communication system. Some basic
