Abstract 
This work describes a novel method to achieve direct formation of highly−oriented Mg−Al 
LDH on Mg−Al−Zn alloy in aqueous HCO3−/CO32− solution of pH 4.3 at 50 °C.  When 
Mg−Al−Zn alloy sample was immersed in the aqueous HCO3−/CO32−, the surface of the Mg sam-
ple corroded.  In addition to raising the solution pH around the surface, the corrosion released 
divalent and trivalent metal cations in the solution.  Experimental results indicate that a 
two−layered Mg−Al LDH thin film formed on the Mg alloy coupon substrate, where a porous 
layer composed of nano−sized Mg−Al LDH was found on top of a dense Mg−Al LDH layer.  
Notably, a core−shell structure with a spherical Mg alloy as the core and an Mg−Al LDH film as 
the shell was fabricated in a relatively short time.  According to adherence test results and 
cross−sectional microstructure examinations, the Mg−Al LDH coating adhered well to the Mg 
alloy substrate.  Moreover, chemical analysis data suggest that the chemical formula of the 
Mg−Al LDH on the Mg coupon sample was Mg6Zn0.4Al2 (OH)15CO3·nH2O, while the Mg−Al 
LDH shell on the spherical Mg alloy core was Mg5.3Zn0.2Al2 (OH)15CO3·nH2O.

pare the core−shell structure.  This work develops an Mg−Al LDH film that consists of 
nano−sized LDH platelets on a flat Mg alloy sample and also on spherical Mg powder in an 
aqueous HCO3−/CO32− solution at 50 ºC.  A core−shell with Mg metal core and an outer shell of 
highly oriented Mg−Al LDH are obtained in 30 min. 
 
Experimental 
Diecast AZ91D Mg alloy thin plate and atomized spherical AZ91D Mg alloy powders were used 
in this work.  The diecast thin plate was the same as that used in our previous study,21,22 and had 
the following composition: 8.80 wt.% Al, 0.69 wt.% Zn, 0.212 wt.% Mn, 0.02 wt.% Si, 0.002 
wt.% Cu, 0.005 wt.% Fe and 0.001 wt.% Ni.  Each square coupon sample had an area of 20 × 
20 mm2 and was 1.4 mm thick.  The coupon surface was ground on 1500 grit SiC paper and 
then cleaned ultrasonically in ethyl alcohol.  The atomized AZ91D magnesium powder has the 
following composition: 8.95 wt.% Al, 0.436 wt.% Zn, 0.19 wt.% Mn, 0.028 wt.% Si, 0.0006 
wt.% Cu, 0.0133 wt.% Fe, 0.0027 wt.% Ni and 0.001 wt% Be.  The powder was sifted to col-
lect the spherical powder with the diameters ranging from 32 to 45 μm.  The powder was then 
cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaner with ethyl alcohol.  Next, carbonated water (aqueous 
HCO3−/CO32− solution) was prepared at room temperature by bubbling CO2 gas through 1000 ml 
of deionized water.  The CO2 gas that did not immediately dissolve in water was recycled.  
The recycled CO2 gas was then recharged into water to generate a carbonated solution.  The 
flow rate of CO2 gas was 1 dm3/min.  Consequently, 20 min sufficed to minimize the pH of the 
solution (pH ~ 4.3).  The CO2 gas removed from industrial emissions appears to be capable of 
fulfilling the purpose of this work, for  reuse to produce an aqueous HCO3−/CO32− solution.  
The solution was heated to 50 °C in a water bath.  Six square coupons were then placed in the 
solution at 50 °C for a particular period.  However, 0.1 g and 0.4 g AZ91D Mg alloy powders 
were each treated in a HCO3−/CO32− aqueous solution of 350 ml at 50 °C with stirring.  Bulk 
solution pH values were determined during the experiments.  Surface microstructures of the 
treated samples were examined using a field−emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, 
JEOL JSM−6700F).  Crystallographic structures that developed on the sample were then deter-
mined by glancing angle X−ray diffraction (GAXRD) at a glancing angle of 1° using Cu Kα1 
(1.5406 Å) radiation.  By performing electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), the 
surface of the Mg−Al LDH coated samples was examined, using a ULVAC−PHI 5000 VersaP-
robe/Scanning ESCA microprobe.  Al Kα radiation with an energy of 1.4866 eV was adopted as 
the X−ray source.  Following sputtering of the surface of the Mg−Al LDH coated sample with 
Ar ions for 15 seconds, the surface was analyzed.  The analysis covered an area of 1 mm2.  
During the analysis, the residual pressure in the analysis chamber was about 10−9 Torr.  TEM 
samples were prepared for cross−sectional observation by a focus ion beam (FIB: FEI 
NOVA−600).  Pt film was deposited on the surface of the area of interest on the sample to pro-
tect the area from ion damage.  Extra materials were removed by the ion beam from both sides 
of the region of interest until a thin specimen (~80 nm) was obtained.  The microstructure of 
Mg−Al LDH coated Mg sample was then examined with an applied voltage of 80 kV by using an 
FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM).  Adherence of the Mg−Al LDH 
 4
peaks of Mg(OH)2 did not appear in the above GAXRD patterns.  Above results verify that 
Mg−Al LDH could form on the Mg alloy by performing immersion treatment in an aqueous 
HCO3−/CO32− solution at 50 ºC.  Growing Mg−Al LDH on the Mg alloy surface involves react-
ing the aqueous HCO3−/CO32− solution with the Mg sample to increase the solution pH value to 
at least 8.3 as soon as possible ( like 0.4  g of Mg alloy powder) or to pH 8.3 but maintained 
continuously at the pH level for an extended period ( like AZ91D coupon).   
Figure 3 presents the SEM micrographs of spherical AZ91D Mg alloy powder before and 
after treatment in a carbonated solution at 50 ºC.  Figure 3 (a) shows the original spherical 
AZ91D Mg alloy powder.  The sphere in Fig. 3 (b) was taken from the 0.1 g Mg alloy powders 
that were treated in an aqueous HCO3−/CO32− solution for 30 min.  Mg−Al LDH platelet−like 
compounds were almost not observed on the sphere surface of 0.1 g powders treated.  Accord-
ing to Fig. 3 (c) (0.4 g−powder sample), highly−oriented Mg−Al LDH platelets developed on the 
sphere surface.  The SEM observation results (Fig. 3 (b) and (c)) were consistent with the 
X−ray diffractogram of the 0.1 g−powder sample and 0.4 g−powder sample (Fig. 2 (a)).  Figure 
4 displays the surface morphology on the diecast AZ91D coupon immersed in a carbonated solu-
tion at 50 °C for various durations.  Figures 4 (a)-(e) show the SEM backscattered electron im-
ages.  Figure 4 (a) presents the surface morphology of a sample after 6 h of immersion.  Figure 
4 (a, left) shows network−like cracks on the sample surface.  The cracks appear to be attributed 
to dehydration, in which those cracks formed before exposure of the sample under vacuum in an 
electron microscope.  Extremely fine platelet−like compounds were observed somewhere on the 
surface (Fig. 4 (a, right)), an observation which is consistent with its X−ray diffractogram show-
ing an extremely weak intensity of Mg−Al LDH.  When immersion time was increased to 9 h, 
as illustrated in the left micrograph of Fig. 4 (b), white spot regions appear on the sample surface.  
The high magnification picture in the right portion of Fig. 4 (b) shows a relatively large size of 
the platelet−like compounds in the white spot region.  As the immersion time increased to 10 h, 
the platelet−like compounds nearly covered the substrate surface (Fig 4 (c)).  Comparing Fig. 4 
(a, right) and Fig. 4 (c, right) reveals that the platelet−like compounds tend to grow to a relatively 
large size as the immersion time of the sample in an aqueous HCO3−/CO32− solution is prolonged 
(Fig. 4(d) and (e) for the changing size).  Table 1 summarizes the ESCA quantitative analysis of 
Mg, Al and Zn contents of the Mg−Al LDH film on the spherical and diecast AZ91D Mg sam-
ples.  ESCA analysis results indicate that the Mg−Al LDH film on spherical AZ91D sample had 
13.1 At% Mg, 4.5 At% Al and XXXX At% Zn, which is equal to a molar ratio of 
2.9(Mg):1(Al):XX(Zn).  On the diecast AZ91D sample, the Mg, Al and Zn contents of the 
Mg−Al film were 10.4 At%, 5.5 At% and XX At% (Table 1), which are equal to a molar ratio of 
1.89(Mg):1(Al):XX(Zn). Based on the ESCA results, the molecular formula of the Mg−Al LDH 
in the sample should be Mg5.3Zn0.3Al2(OH)15.2CO3·mH2O.   
Figure 5 (a) describes the surface of the Mg−Al LDH coated sample after the cross−cut tape 
test.  The sample surface was cut first, followed by sticking an adhesive tape on the cross−cut 
area.  The tape was pulled back at an angle close to 180º.  According to Fig. 5 (a), none of the 
squares of the lattice were detached.  According to ASTM D3359−93 27, the adhesion quality 
for the test result in Fig. 5 (a) was ranked as 5B.  The 5B ranking suggests that the Mg−Al LDH 
 6
strated that a Mg−Al LDH coating formed on the diecast AZ91D Mg alloy was Mg6Zn0.4Al2 
(OH)15CO3·nH2O, while that formed on spherical Mg alloy was Mg5.3Zn0.2Al2 (OH)15CO3·nH2O.
