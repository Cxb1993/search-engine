timation of geoacoustic parameters, especially
for higher frequencies. The purpose of this pa-
per is to report the geoacoustic inversion results
from stationary source data obtained during
the Shallow Water 2006 experiment (SW06).
The experimental site is on the outer continen-
tal shelf of the western North Atlantic and is
located roughly at 100 miles east of Atlantic
City, New Jersey. During the experiment, both
acoustic and oceanographic data were collected.
Significant ocean sound speed variations were
observed from the ctd measurements made at
the source and receiving array.
To mitigate the ocean sound speed mis-
match, several environmental parameteriza-
tions were investigated, including three range-
independent models and two range-dependent
models. Of interest is which model can better
represent the geoacoustic environment sensed
by the acoustic transmissions. During this ex-
periment, the values of the geometric parame-
ters are reasonably well known through direct
measurements. Comparing the measured and
estimated values of these known parameters is
one measure of effectiveness of the environmen-
tal models. While an expedient approach, ob-
taining agreement between the measured and
estimated values is a necessary but not suffi-
cient condition to indicate the model is a good
representation of the actual environment.3
II. THE SW06 EXPERIMENT
On JD239, acoustic transmissions were made
from a J-15 source at 30-m depth deployed from
the R/V Knorr. The experimental geometry is
illustrated schematically in Fig. 1 (a). A 16-
element 56.25-m aperture autonomous record-
ing vertical line array (vla) was moored at lo-
cation 39◦1.477′N, 73◦2.256′E where the water
depth was 79 m. The lowermost element was
8.2 m above the bottom. Acoustic transmis-
sions were carried out from four stations (at
distances of 1, 3, 5, and 7 km from the vla).
FIG. 1. (a) Range dependent parameterization of
the SW06 environment. (b) Measured sound-speed
profiles during the acoustic transmissions. The
times when the CTD were taken are indicated as a
suffix.
At each station, two sets of 5-min multitonal
combs were transmitted, low frequencies at 53,
103, 203 and 253 Hz, and mid frequencies at
303, 403, 503 and 703 Hz. Only the multitonal
transmissions at the 1-km range (wp21; 2155–
2205 UTC) are discussed here.
The sound-speed profile in the water column
was measured by conductivity-temperature-
depth (ctd) casts. Figure 1(b) shows sound-
speed profiles during the acoustic transmis-
sions. The ctd measurements at the vla
(ctd1917 and 1955) exhibit small variations
above 10 m and below 35 m. However, notice-
able time-evolving sound-speed fluctuations on
the order of 10 m/s are observed in the ther-
mocline (where the sound source was located).
The ctd casts were carried out at each sta-

uses the sound speed profile measured at the
vla (ctd1955). The third model, ri-3, inverts
for the first three eof coefficients in order to
model and estimate the sound speed profile.
Second, a range-dependent water column is
considered. Beside the spatial sound speed vari-
ations observed in the ctd measurements, the
echosounder measurements show about a 1-m
difference in water depth from the source to the
vla. Instead of estimating an average water
depth, the water depths at the source (wdsrc)
and vla (wdrcv) were both included in the in-
version for model rd-1 and the sound speed
profiles measured at these two sites were used.
In model rd-2, a total of 6 eof coefficients were
used to model the sound speed profiles at the
source and the vla along with estimating the
corresponding water depths as well.
C. Objective function and optimization method
The objective function measures the discrep-
ancy between the measured acoustic and replica
fields calculated for likely values of the un-
known parameters. The data misfit objective
function is based on the incoherent multifre-
quency Bartlett processor:

to have unit length, R is an estimated csdm
normalized to have unit trace, L the number

Hastings algorithm.7 Table I summarizes the
estimated value, sagapowell, and the parame-
ter uncertainty estimate, sagamean±σ, for each
of the model parameters in rd-2. We see that
some parameters are estimated very accurately,
for example, the mean value of the upper sedi-
ment sound speed c0 is 1596 m/s with a stan-
dard deviation of only 11.5 m/s. The inversion
result is in very good agreement with the sandy
bottom geoacoustic properties indicated by in
situ measurements4.
The estimated sound speed profiles (Fig. 3a)
at the source (thick dashed) and the vla (thin
dashed)are very similar to each other and re-
semble the measured profile at the vla (thin
solid). This might explain that the consis-
tent misfit values obtained for both ri-3 and
rd-1 models. Figure 3(b) shows good agree-
ment between the measured (solid) and mod-
eled (dashed) acoustic fields for the frequencies
used in the inversion. At short range, it appears
that the acoustic field is not particularly sensi-
tive to the range-dependent ocean sound speed
structure, and an equivalent range-independent
sound speed model may be sufficient for de-
scribing the environment.
IV. SUMMARY
Uncertainty in ocean sound speed struc-
ture affects matched field geoacoustic inver-
sion results. In the SW06 experiment, spatio-
temporal variability of the ocean sound speed
structure was observed during the acoustic
transmissions. The uncertainty in the ocean
sound speed profiles was mitigated by including
eof coefficients for either a range-independent
or range-dependent ocean sound speed envi-
ronment in the inversion. The inversion re-
