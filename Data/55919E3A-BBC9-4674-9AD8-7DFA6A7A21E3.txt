I. Introduction 
Defect diagnostics is used to ensure the safe running of mechanical systems. Many kinds of fault diagnosis 
methods have been proposed for bearing defect diagnosis, among which there are many well-established methods 
available, including the frequency-domain analysis methods (Heng and Nor 1998; Shiroishi , Liang, Kurfess and 
Danyluk 1997; Mathew and Alfredson 1984; McFadden and Smith 1984; Sheen 2004; Sheen 2007; Su and Lin 1993; 
Su and Sheen 1993; Tandon and Choudhury 1999), the time-domain analysis methods (Heng and Nor 1998; Mathew 
and Alfredson 1984), the statistical analysis methods (Heng and Nor 1998), and the wavelet analysis methods (Huang 
1996; Li and Ma 1997; Lin and Qu 2000; Nikolaou and Antoniadis 2002; Sheen and Hung 2004). In the 
frequency-domain analysis, the high frequency resonance technique (HFRT) is the most popular method to apply in 
bearing vibrations. The purpose of applying the HFRT is to derive envelope signals for bearing vibrations with 
amplitude modulation and, thus, the envelope spectra could be used in the defect diagnosis. In the implementation of 
HFRT, the vibration signal would be operated through a bandpass filter to derive a single mode vibration and, then, an 
envelope signal could be derived from the bandpassed signal with an envelope detection process. The bandwidth of 
the bandpass filter should be around a selected high-frequency band with the center at a chosen resonance frequency 
of the mechanical system. Thus, the HFRT could take advantage of the absence of low-frequency mechanical noise to 
demodulate a bearing vibration in the range of the system resonance and, therefore, provides a low-frequency 
envelope signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio. 
On the other hand, the time-domain and the kurtosis analysis methods are tried to derive quantitative indexes for 
bearing vibrations. The time-domain analysis methods would detect the occurrence of defect impulse in the wave crest. 
High energy level of the vibration signals measured by the RMS values or the crest factors may indicate the 
occurrence of defects. The statistical analysis methods provide the shape of the amplitude probability distributions for 
diagnosing the incipient defects. However, the effectiveness of applying the time-domain methods would depend on 
the defect mode and the operation condition. In addition, the study (Heng and Nor 1998) shows the poor performance 
of the kurtosis and the crest factor for the bearing defect diagnosis at the running speed more than 1500rpm, especially 
under the condition of outer-race defect. Thus, these methods are in general regarded as auxiliary indexes in defect 
diagnosis. 
In recent years, the wavelet transform is often applied in the vibration analysis of mechanical system. Displays of 
signal analyses using the continuous-time wavelet transform are shown in the time-frequency domain and called 
scalograms (Vetterli and Kovacevic 1995). According to the pattern of scalogram, the characteristics of analyzed 
signal could be classified. Thus, the wavelet transform could be useful in the defect diagnosis of mechanical system. 
However, the scalogram would be seriously affected by the parameters of dilation and center frequency. Improper 
designation of the parameters could result in the invisibility of characteristic pattern for the analyzed signal. 
In order to improve the above problem, the wavelet-based enveloping function (WBEF) derived from the linear 
combination of Morlet wavelet is proposed to implement the HFRT and its function parameters could be easily 
designated according to the resonance mode of mechanical system (Sheen and Hung 2004; Huang 1996). In the 
function, there are four parameters to assign for designation and adjustment of the filtering passband, which are the 
low cut-off frequency, the high cut-off frequency, the dilation and the frequency difference. Accordingly, it would be 
convenient to designate the filtering passband for applying in the HFRT. However, it is found that the envelope 
spectrum for a normal bearing could show a similar defect pattern under large preload or at high running speed (Su, 
Lin and Lee 1993; Su and Sheen 1993; Su, Sheen and Lin 1992). Thus, it would be difficult to diagnose the bearing 
running condition. 
In the paper, another WBEF with only three parameters is proposed in the envelope detection of bearing 
vibration and, then, the exponential decay frequency (EDF) of the envelope signal is estimated to be a quantitative 
index for the bearing defect diagnosis. Accordingly, it could solve the above problems in the bearing defect diagnosis. 
With properly designating the function parameters, the WBEF could be applied in the HFRT to filter out one of the 
 4
the wavelet transform that could decompose a signal v(t)L2(R) into elementary functions Ga,(t) is also a linear 
transformation and could be defined as 
  *

   ,              (10) 
where 
*
, ( )aG t  are a complex conjugate of Ga,(t). 
For convenience, two independent frequency variables aff LL /  and aff HH /  would be introduced, the 
analysis wavelet Ga,(t) would be a WBEF and could be rewritten as

Similar to that the real part of gc,a,(t) is orthogonal to its imaginary part (Sheen and Hung 2004), the real part and the 
imaginary part of function , , , ( )L Ha f fG t    would be also orthogonal to each other. It is noted that , , , ( )L Ha f fG t    with a 
wide bandwidth covering the ith resonance mode could be easily designated by setting the values of high-cutoff 
frequency Hf   and low-cutoff frequency Lf  . In addition, the passband quality could be guaranteed under a proper 
selection of the dilation a. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, the increase of dilation a would decrease the convergent speed 
of waveform but increase the slope attenuation. In view of practical consideration for both the sharp slope attenuation 
and the fast waveform convergence of function 
*
, , , ( )L Ha f fG t   , it is suggested that a selection of the dilation is 
constrained in the range 0.007≤ a≤ 0.015 and the waveform interval could be less than 10 ms.

filtering passband covering a bandwidth 2 kHz with the center at its corresponding resonance frequency was 
designated for analyzing a vibration mode. The measured direction was radial to the shaft in the horizontal. The tested 
bearings running at 2000 rpm were used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method for the 
bearing vibrations. The characteristic frequencies for roller defect, outer-race defect and inner-race defect are 195.5 
Hz, 237.3 Hz, and 329.3 Hz, respectively. 
 
1. Bearing diagnosis for the roller defect 
In the past, it is shown that the envelope spectrum for a normal bearing would be possible to show a similar 
defect pattern of the main peaks with equal frequency spacing sidebands under large preload (Su et al. 1993) or at 
high running speed (Su et al. 1992), except the main peaks in the spectrum for a normal bearing are lower (Su and 
Sheen 1993). Thus, it could be difficult to diagnose the running condition of normal bearing with the envelope 
spectrum. In the following, the WBEF would be applied in detecting the vibration envelope of the roller defect and the 
normal bearings. It is shown that the envelope spectra would be a pattern of the characteristic frequency and its 
harmonics with equal frequency spacing sidebands and is similar to those derived from the HFRT (Su and Sheen 1993; 
Su et al. 1992). In addition, it is found that the envelope spectra for the normal bearing would also show a pattern 
similar to that for the roller defect one. Finally, the EDF of envelope signal would be studied to solve the incapable 
problem of envelope spectrum in the defect diagnosis of bearing vibration. 
Figure 10 shows the bearing vibration of roller defect in the time and the frequency domains, and there are four 
resonance modes that could be found in Fig. 10(b). Figure 11 shows the investigation result of the first resonance 
mode. Figs. 11(a) and (b) are the extracted vibration and its corresponding envelope signal, respectively. The envelope 
spectrum in Fig. 11(c) shows clear the characteristic frequencies of roller defect at 195.5 Hz and its harmonics and 
would be agree with that derived from the HFRT (Su and Sheen 1993; Su et al. 1992). In addition, Figs. 12-14 show 
the effectiveness of applying the WBEF in the vibration analysis of the second mode, the third mode and the fourth 
mode, respectively. Thus, it is shown that the WBEF could be effectively applied in the envelope analysis for the 
bearing vibration of roller defect.  
On the other hand, the investigation for the vibration of normal bearing is studied and compared with the above 
study for the vibration of roller defect bearing. As shown in Fig. 15(b), the resonance modes of the normal bearing are 
similar to those of the defect one. Figs. 16-17 show the envelope analysis for the vibrations of the four resonance 
modes, respectively. In Figs. 18(c) and 19(c), the characteristic frequencies at 195.5 Hz and its harmonics could be 
found. Especially, Fig 19(c) shows clear the patterns of equal defect frequency spacing distribution around the 
characteristic frequencies, which is similar to those for the roller defect bearing. Thus, it would be difficult to diagnose 
the running condition with the above envelope spectra for the normal bearing.  
In the following, the EDFs for the defect and the normal bearings are studied to deal with the above problem. Fig. 
20 shows that the EDFs for the roller defect bearing are very much larger than those for the normal one. In addition, 
the EDFs for the normal bearing are smaller than 400. In Table 3, a comparison for the averages of EDF between the 
normal and the defect bearings is also found that the values for the normal bearing are not exceed 150. Accordingly, 
the EDF could be applied to diagnose the roller defect bearing. 
 
2. Bearing diagnosis for the outer race and the inner race defect 
On the purpose of examining the effectiveness of applying the EDF to diagnose the outer-race and the inner-race 
defect bearings, the vibration analysis for the vibration modes would be investigated. Figures 21 and 22 show the EDFs 
for the outer-race and the inner-race defect bearings, respectively. In comparison with the EDF for the normal bearing, 
the EDFs for the outer-race and the inner-race defect bearings are very much larger. In addition, these EDFs are larger 
than 890 and 830, respectively. In Table 3, the averages of EDF for these four resonance modes are listed. It is shown 
that the EDF could be a quantitative index applied to diagnose the bearing defects of the outer race and the inner race.
