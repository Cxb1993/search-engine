Despite the panoply of approaches and methods for measuring and improving SC performance, relatively 
little research is performed for the construction industry. Most published literature in construction are limited 
to cause-and-effect or correlational relationships between measures (or actions) and SC performance (e.g., 
Briscoe and Dainty, 2005; Ergen and Akinci, 2008; Gulledge and Chavusholu, 2008; Jeong et al., 2006; Li 
and Womer, 2008; Loosemore and McCarthy, 2008; Polat et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007; Wong and Wong, 
2008; Xue et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2007; Yeo and Ning, 2002). Little research addresses the development of 
SC performance measurement models from a holistic perspective for the construction industry. Hence, there 
appears short of the development of systematic and balanced SC performance measurement systems in 
construction. 
Further, for a balanced approach, while financial performance measurements are important for strategic 
decisions, day-to-day operational control of manufacturing and distributions is often handled better with 
non-financial measures (Maskell, 1991). Although considerable research (for industries other than 
construction) on developing SC performance measurement models in a balanced framework (e.g., Bhagwat 
and Sharma, 2007; Gunasekaran et al., 2004; Saad and Patel, 2006; van Hoek, 1998) has been reported, 
relatively few studies address how to systematically relate metrics from strategic (financial) to operational 
levels. As a result, there appears to be lack of models capable of reflecting quantitative financial performance 
from perceptual operational performance measures. (For example, how much will the profit margin be as the 
perceptual measure of delivery performance is given?) 
Furthermore, although the volume of SC performance measurement models have been developed (e.g., 
Beamon, 1999; Berrah and Cliville, 2007; Chan and Qi, 2003, 2003; Lambert and Pohlen, 2001; Gunasekaran 
et al., 2001, 2004; Neely et al., 2005; Ritchie and Brindley, 2007; Stewart, 1995; 1997; van Hoek, 1998), little 
research performs longitudinal analysis of operational and financial performance measures in SCs. 
Accordingly, there appears to lack the development of SC performance measurement models capable of 
projecting quantitative financial performance based on perceptual operational metrics in previous time 
periods. 
1.2.  Objective of this research 
Responding to these limitations and restricting the focus to the construction industry, we propose the 
development of a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) prototype system for supporting 
continuous improvement of firm financial performance. To achieve the objective of our research, we have 
developed three research questions (see sections 3.1 to 3.3). Answers to each of these research questions claim 
significant contributions to the state of knowledge, and we treat each of them in turn. Collectively, we will 
contribute new theory and empirical insight with solid experiment evidence and relevancy, which in return 
provide management a clear detailed picture and understanding of what to expect with regard to firm financial 
performance while the values of certain perceptual operational performance metrics change. 
1.3.  Limitations of existing approaches to cost flow predictions 
A SC is an integrated process wherein raw materials are manufactured into final products, then delivered 
to customers through distribution, retail, or both (Cohen and Moon, 1990). SCM is the process of planning, 
executing, monitoring, and controlling the operations of the SC. Performance measurement is the process of 
quantifying the effectiveness and efficiency of actions, where effectiveness is the extent to which a customer's

Spekman et al., 2002; Zailani and Rajagopal, 2005) continue to study the cause-and-effect or correlational 
relationships between measures and SC performance, one group of writers (e.g., Archie and Kevin, 2004; 
Beamon, 1999; Berrah and Cliville, 2007; Bhagwat and Sharma, 2007; Chan and Qi, 2003, 2003; Lai et al., 
2002; Lambert and Pohlen, 2001; Lau et al., 2002; Green et al., 2008; Gunasekaran et al., 2001, 2004; Neely 
et al., 2005; Neely et al., 2000; Ritchie and Brindley, 2007; Saad and Patel, 2006; Shepherd and Gunter, 2006; 
Stewart, 1995; 1997; Swinehart and Smith, 2005; van Hoek, 1998; Wong and Wong, 2007, 2008) take a more 
comprehensive approach to SC performance management. This group of writers focus on the design and 
development of systematic and balanced SC performance measurement systems. 
For example, van Hoek (1998) developed a preliminary framework for a SC measurement system based 
on the strategic context and operational contribution of players in the SC competitiveness. Beamon (1999) 
utilized a systematic approach to develop a framework for manufacturing SC performance measurement 
systems based on three separate types of performance measures, including resource, output, and flexibility 
measures. Lambert and Pohlen (2001) used a link-by-link approach to develop a framework for SC metrics, 
allowing to align performance from point-of-origin to point-of-consumption with the overall objective of 
maximizing shareholder value for the total SC and for each company. 
Chan and Qi (2003) further developed an innovative framework that adopts a system-thinking 
perspective for measuring the total SC performance based on fuzzy set theory, providing a means for 
identifying important performance metrics. Building from this work, Gunasekaran et al. (2001, 2003) 
developed a framework for measuring the strategic, tactical and operational level performance in a SC, using 
an intensive literature survey and the result of an empirical study on 21 British companies. 
Recently, Shepherd and Gunter (2006) provided a taxonomy framework of performance measures and 
outlined specific implications for future research, followed by a critical evaluation of contemporary 
performance measurement systems designed to evaluate the performance of SCs. Bhagwat and Sharma (2007) 
developed a performance measurement of SCM based on a balanced scorecard to assess business operations 
from financial, customer, internal-business-process, and learning and growth perspectives, each perspective is 
evaluated using 10, 17, 15, and 12 measures, respectively. 
More recently, Karen et al. (2008) developed a framework for tour operators to use in the 
implementation of SCM processes to improve and assess sustainability performance, using the analysis of 
Deming Cycle of 'plan-do-review' on a sample of industry associations and key tour operators. Using 
Meredith's (1993) philosophical conceptualization, Seuring and Muller (2008) further developed a conceptual 
framework for SC risk and performance management based on an intensive literature review on SCM, taking 
191 papers published from 1994 to 2007 into account. 
This research proposes to develop a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) prototype system 
for continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction industry. Multiple reasons 
support the need for developing such a performance measurement system. First, despite the fact that the sector 
(industry type) variable plays a significant role in performance measurement studies (e.g., Evans and Jack, 
2003; Otley, 1999; Sulek et al., 2006), relatively few published studies in SC address the development of SC 
performance measurement models from a holistic perspective for the construction industry. Although 
considerable construction research on developing SC performance models (e.g., Briscoe and Dainty, 2005; 
Dzeng, et al., 2005; Ergen and Akinci, 2008; Gulledge and Chavusholu, 2008; Jeong et al., 2006; Li and 
Womer, 2008; Loosemore and McCarthy, 2008; Polat et al., 2007; Tserng et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007;

however, fail to provide quantitative financial performance measures. For example, how much will the profit 
margin be as the perceptual measure of delivery performance is given, and how much will Return on Assets 
(ROA) be if the perceptual measure of customer satisfaction performance is evaluated? 
Third, despite the panoply of approaches to SC performance measurement models (e.g., Beamon, 1999; 
Berrah and Cliville, 2007; Chan and Qi, 2003, 2003; Lambert and Pohlen, 2001; Gunasekaran et al., 2001, 
2004; Neely et al., 2005; Ritchie and Brindley, 2007; Stewart, 1995; 1997; van Hoek, 1998), little research 
performs longitudinal analysis of operational and financial performance measures in SCs. To the writer's 
knowledge, there appears to be lack of development of SC performance measurement models, capable of 
projecting future quantitative financial performance based on perceptual performance measure metrics in 
previous time periods, although SC operational measures could be a useful predictor of financial performance 
(e.g., Bernhardt et al., 2000; Christensen et al., 2007). For example, through the time series data of a chain of 
fast-food restaurants, Bernhardt et al. (2000) concluded that customer satisfaction is significantly related to 
firm financial performance. Their study, however, only provided the results of the hypothesis tests. Similarly, 
Christensen et al. (2007) concluded that SC lead-time variance is a useful predictor of financial performance 
based on the confirmatory factor analysis on a sample of 210 firms; however, their study only provided the 
results of the hypothesis tests. 
 
研究方法及流程 
In the previous section, existing SC performance measurement models and approaches were extensively 
critiqued. The criticism suggests the following: First, there is short of SC performance measurement models 
for continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction industry. Second, existing SC 
performance measurement models fail to provide quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational 
performance metrics. Third, existing SC performance measurement models appear unable to project future 
quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational performance metrics in previous time periods. 
The criticism suggests that much of current basis of SC performance measurement models remains inadequate 
to its task, and new models have to be developed, particularly with regard to the construction industry. To 
achieve this task, three research questions are posed as the following. 
2.1. Research question 1: How does this research develop a holistic SC performance measurement 
(HSCPM) model for continuous improvement of firm financial performance in the construction 
industry? 
As demonstrated in section 2 of this proposal, the sector (industry type) variable plays an important role 
in organizational performance measurement studies. However, relatively few published studies in SC address 
the development of SC performance measurement models from a holistic perspective for the construction 
industry. Although considerable construction research on developing SC performance models (e.g., Ergen and 
Akinci, 2008; Gulledge and Chavusholu, 2008; Jeong et al., 2006; Li and Womer, 2008; Polat et al., 2007; 
Wang et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2005) has been reported, most published literature in construction are limited to 
cause-and-effect or correlational relationships between measures (or actions) and SC performance. As a result, 
the contribution is to develop a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) model for continuously 
improving firm financial performance in the construction industry.

perceptual performance measures change. To resolve this incapability of SC performance measurement 
models requires the development of new methods. As a result, the contribution is to create a novel approach 
that enables a perceptual SC performance measurement model to generate quantitative and predicted 
quantitative figures of financial performance. 
The methodology to generate this novel approach is fourfold. In the first stage, we will develop a 
longitudinal survey instrument for data collection. The development of this survey instrument is achieved 
through two steps. First, based on those firms listed on the construction sector of the Taiwan Stock Exchange1, 
we will benchmark firm financial performance, using the longitudinal analysis detailed in (Bernhardt et al., 
2000). Second, in conjunction with the benchmark data generated in stage 1 and the survey instrument created 
in research question 1, we will develop the longitudinal survey instrument to bridge (connect) perceptual 
operational performance measures to the benchmarked measures of firm financial performance. 
In the second stage, we will develop nexus between perceptual operational performance measures and 
numerical figures of firm financial performance based on the bridge (connection) found in the first stage and 
ratio analysis of financial statements2 detailed in (Anthony et al., 2000; Wild et al., 2004). In the third stage, 
based on the nexus found in step 2, we will further investigate what relationships exist between financial 
performance ratios in current and previous time periods, providing the foundation for developing a forecasting 
ability of the HSCPM model. 
In the fourth stage, we will formalize and model the findings in stages 2 and 3 to provide the HSCPM 
model with the ability of projecting current and future quantitative financial performance by the 
corresponding perceptual performance measure metrics. This will be achieved by combining time series and 
regression analysis that is well detailed in (Freund and Wilson, 1998; Hanssens et al., 1990; Shumway and 
Stoffer, 2000). The model's formulation will be further shaped using additional guidelines on existing work 
(e.g., 曾惠斌、蕭文雄, 1998; Brandt, 2000; Dehning et al., 2007; Hallowell et al., 1996; Christensen et al., 
2007). 
With the existing methodology of time series and regression analysis (e.g., Freund and Wilson, 1998; 
Shumway and Stoffer, 2000), it is relatively easy to model the relationships developed in stages 2 and 3 for 
projecting current and future quantitative financial performance by perceptual operational performance 
metrics. The challenge comes from how to validate the relationships developed in stages 2 and 3 and, thus, 
ensure that the forecasts and estimation of the HSCPM model are unbiased. Handling this challenge demands 
a comprehensive understanding of design and analysis of surveys and experiments associated with statistical 
generation in research. At this moment, we plan to handle this challenge by a thorough study on existing 
methods of design and analysis of surveys and experiments, starting from Fowler (2001) and Montgomery 
(2001). 
2.3. Research question 3: How does this research develop the HSCPM model into a computer prototype 
system that implements the full functions of HSCPM? 
                                                 
1 The TSEC was founded in 1961 and began operating as a stock exchange on the 9th of February 1962. The TSEC is regulated by 
the Financial Supervisory Commission, a commission of the Ministry of Finance, subordinate to the Executive Yuan of Taiwan. 
At this point in time (2008Q4), there are 55 firms listed on the construction sector of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  
2 The financial statements will be collected from those privately owned construction firms that participate our research and from 
those firms listed on the construction sector of the Taiwan Stock Exchange.

研究結果討論 
This research develops a holistic SC performance measurement (HSCPM) model for supporting 
continuous improvement of firm financial performance. The components and important results of HSCPM 
model are discussed as the following: The infrastructure of this prototype system is composed of a Raw Data 
(RD) storage responsible for storing raw data, a Processed Data (PD) storage responsible for storing 
processed data, a Financial Ratio Calculator (FRC) responsible for computing financial ratios, an Initial 
Holistic SC Performance Measurement (IHSCPM) mechanism responsible for benchmarking firm financial 
performance and, then, creating generating a cross-sectional optimal holistic SC performance measurement 
model, a Firm-Specific Holistic SC Performance Measurement (FHSCPM) mechanism responsible for 
refining the cross-sectional measurement model to firm-specific optimal holistic SC performance 
measurement model, and a  longitudinal Reconciliation (LR) algorism responsible for restructuring financial 
performance ratios and the processed data. These components coordinate one another and, thus, projecting 
current and future financial performance by perceptual operational performance metrics for the firm.  
The future research should take this HSCPM model to build a prototype. The methodology to generate 
the prototype system capable of performing HSCPM is fourfold. First, together with the HSCPM model and 
the proposed prototype system architecture, we will identify and develop the necessary components of the 
computer prototype system for implementing HSCPM by the function analysis system technique (Dell'isola, 
1997; Mudge, 1989). Second, we will determine the formats, design their details, and construct their protocols 
for each of the necessary components by stochastic approaches, with additional guidelines on existing work 
with regard to performance system (e.g., Gunasekaran et al., 2004; Neely et al., 1995, 2005; Neely et al., 2000; 
Otley, 1999; Tserng et al., 2004). Third, we will build the prototype system by database languages, such as 
Microsoft Assess or Microsoft Visual FoxPro. Fourth, we will test and validate the prototype system by the 
collected sample data. Consequently, the contribution is the development of the prototype system capable of 
executing full functions of the HSCPM model and associated knowledge about the prototype’ designing and 
constructing process in this research. 
 
計畫成果自評 
The research results are complacent and are mostly as what we expected. We are currently working on 
papers related to this research. Because of the accuracy and reliability of the HSCPM model, the model is 
useful for improving financial performance and, hence, enhancing the profitability of construction firms in the 
industry.
