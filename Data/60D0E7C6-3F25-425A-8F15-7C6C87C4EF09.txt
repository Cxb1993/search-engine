An endochronic theory with damage was 
proposed first by Valanis in 1975 [11]. The 
intrinsic time measure based on the total strain 
increment was employed to define the damage 
time scale, and the probability of damage 
depended on the net strain energy density over 
the threshold energy of damage. The theory was 
applied successfully by Valanis and Wu in the 
gray cast iron under proportional strain path [12]. 
In 1982, Valanis used a damage time scale which 
is the same as the intrinsic time defined in the 
plastic strain increment, and developed a proba- 
bilistic endochronic theory of facture [13]. 
Between 1990 and 1991, Valanis proposed 
theories of brittle damage and of global damage 
[14,15], in which isotropic and anisotropic 
damage parameters and their evolution laws 
were introduced and then fitted into the 
constitutive modeling, From 1992 to 1995, 
Chow and Chen developed a theory of endo- 
chronic plasticity with nonisotropic damage 
under thermodynamic consideration and then 
casted into the FEA to study the crack growth of 
CT specimen [16]. In 2005, an endochronic 
theory of cyclic viscoplasticity for eutectic 
Sn/Pb solder alloy was proposed by Lee and 
Shieh [2]. In this paper, the previous theory [2] 
will be extended by the thermodynamic formula- 
tion with isotropic damage and then apply to 
case of constant strain amplitude cyclic tests. 
 
2. Thermodynamics of Endochronic Cyclic 
Viscoplastcity with Damage 
In the study of damage of material, many 
theories had been proposed based on different 
level of scale. At the microscale level, micro- 
mechamics or experimental observation and  
measurement are used to account for the accu- 
mulation of microstress in the neighborhood of 
defects or interfaces and breaking of bonds, 
which both damage the material. At the 
mesoscale level, a Representative Element 
Volume(RVE) is defined, which is small enough 
to avoid smoothing the high gradients of micro- 
stress and microstrain but large enough to 
represent an average of the microprocesses of 
damage. Hence phenomenological continuum 
mechanics can be employed to analyze the 
overall effect of the growth and the coalescence 
of microcracks or microvoids which together 
initiate one macrocrack. At the macroscale level, 
the growth and fracture of the macrocrack (may 
be initiated at the end of mesoscale crack growth) 
can be accounted by the fracture mechanics with 
variables defined at the macroscale level. 
 
2.1 Thermodynamics Formulation 
Consider the Helmholtz free energy ψ  of 
a thermodynamic system of isotropically 
mesoscale RVE with isotropic damage and under 
isothermal and inelastically incompressible 
small strain conditions, can be expressed by a 
combination of its hydrostatic part Hψ  and 
deviatoric part Dψ : 
( , , ) (  , , )r rH kk H Dq D e q Dψ ψ ε ψ= +            (1) 
here the strain tensor 1 3 kk eε ε δ= +   ; r r r
Hq q qδ= +   ( 1,2,r n= … ), which represent a set of internal state variables which are 2nd 
order symmetric tensors, D is the isotropic 
damage parameter. In the present case of eutectic 
Sn/Pb solder alloy, the hydrostatic behavior with 
damage can be assumed elastic, i.e. 0rHq ≡  and 
Hψ  can be written as  
  21 ( )
2H kk
K Dψ ε=                (2) 
and the hydrostatic stress Hσ  can be derived 
by 
/ ( )H H kk kkK Dσ ψ ε ε= ∂ ∂ =          (3) 
here / 3H kkσ σ= , K(D) is the elastic bulk 
modulus which is a function of D. 
  The functional expression of Dψ  depends on 
the choice of elastic deviatoric strain ee  or inelastic strain INe  respectively as one of the internal state variable rq

. Since e INe e e= +   , one may use two subsystems (1)Dψ  and (2)Dψ , 
combining in series to define Dψ , i.e. 
(1) (2)
D D Dψ ψ ψ= +                    (4) 
Here two types of expression may be written as 
follows:

and

Here ( )Dρ is a material parameter with damage, 
α and k are two material constants. 
For details, see Valanis and Lee[17]. 
     According to the concept of elastic modu- 
lus with damage, proposed by Budiansky and 
O’Connell[18], E under simple tensile test can 
be written as  
0 (1 )
eE E Dσ ε= = −                (16) 
here 0E  is the Young’s modulus. The eq.(16) 
can be rewritten as

and 01D E E= −                     (17b) 
hereσ is the effective stress of damage proposed 
by Rabotnov[5], and the damage parameter D m 
ust be interpreted by the ratio of total surface of 
microcracks or microcavities DS  to the total 
surface S in the mesoscale (i.e. DD S S= ) pro- 
posed by Kachnov[5]. Obviously the term “effe- 
ctive stress” implies that the force must act on 
the effective area DS S− , and no force acts on 
the damaged area. As a result, all effects due to 
microstress concentration and mutual interact- 
tions of microdefects are averaged out. The 
above discussion may allow eq.(8a) to be re- 
written as: 
0
2 (1 ) eS D eµ= −                         (18a) 
0( ) 2 (1 )D Dµ µ= −                 (18b) 
here 0µ is the elastic shear modulus. The effect- 
ive deviatoric stress tensor S  is then defined as  
0
(1 - ) 2 eS S D eµ= =                     (18c) 
Eq.(18c) preserves the elasticity law in the mes- 
oscale RVE. Also from eq.(6c) the effective 
stress S  acting on the first thermodynamic subsystem is carried over to act on the second 
thermodynamic subsystem. This result allows 
one to propose the following statements:

Replacement of S  with S ,eqs. (18c), (20a) and (20b) enjoy the same conventional consti- 
tutive equations used in the endochronic (vis- 
co)plasticity of material without damage. This 
conclusion coincides with the statement of the 
“Strain Equivalence Principle” in the mesoscale 
RVE proposed by Lemaitre [5]. 
 
2.2 Evolution Equation of Damage 
    To discuss the evolution equation of da- 
mage parameter D in the present thermo- 
dynamic formulation, one may propose that the 
damage rate D  is proportional to the strain 
energy density release rate G which is respon- 
sible for the loss of stiffness in the RVE with 
damage. Here G can be found from eqs. (7) and 
(18b), i.e.,

The time scale in the damage rate can be propo- 
sed by the same thought of  the endochronic 
time scale, i.e. 
DD dD dZ≡                      (22a) 
and the damage time scale DZ  is a material 
parameter, such that  
0( )IND D D DdZ A de H Z Z= −          (22b) 
here the positive and nondimensional value of 
DA  is a material property which is similar to the 
material functions f and 0h  in the definition of 
endochronic intrinsic time increment dZ [2]. 
0
DZ  is the threshold value of DZ and ( )H i  is 
the Heavyside function. Thus when 0D DZ Z≤ , 
there is no damage, i.e. 0D = , 0D = . Accor- 
ding to the Clausius-Duhem inequality, G D  
must be nonnegative. Hence the evolution 
equation of damage can be written as : when

5. Computational Results of 63Sn/37Pb under  
Uniaxially Cyclic Tests with Damage 
In the application of endochronic cyclic 
viscoplasticity, one must determine the kernel 
function 0( )
KZZ e Zαρ ρ −= and its approximate 
function as in eq.(25f). Also only 0.1Hz testing 
frequence and temperature at 303 K were used in 
the cyclic tests discussed in the previous section, 
the functional form of the strain rate sensitivity 
function 0 ( , )h Tξ  in the definition of intrinsic 
time increment Z∆ , see eq.(26b), can not be 
constructed, therefore 0h  is treated as a 
constant, whose value can be absorbed into the 
value of 0ρ  and K  in ( )Zρ . In this paper, 
0 1h ≡  is then used for simplicity. From Fig.6, 
one can use the cyclic stress-strain curve after 
the 1st point of strain reversal and define INε  
and σ  started at that point of reversal as

determined by the slope of logσ  vs log INε

A log[ ( )]Z Zα ρ  vs Z  plot allows one to 
determine the value of K within the range of 
larger value of Z. As shown in Fig.14, K=20.3. 
The value of 0ρ  can then be determined by 
using the values of α  and K in the computa- 
tion of the cyclic stress-strain curve for N=1. The 
value of 0 3.53( )MPaρ = . The function of ( )Zρ  
can be written as

For details, see Lee and Shieh[2]. The approxim- 
ation of ( )Zρ  by a series of exponentially 
decay functions, i.e. (25f) can also be deter- 
mined by the method discussed in the published 
papers by Lee, e.g.[2,21]. The result is
