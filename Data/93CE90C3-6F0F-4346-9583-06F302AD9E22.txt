將對介電層下之銅圖形產生高能量離子撞擊且造成結構傷害。藉此方式我們製作了金屬三維

Abstract 
E-Beam direct writing lithography method associating with Hydrogen Silesquioxane (HSQ) as a 
photo-resister was used for the Metallic Photonic Crystal (MPC) fabrication. Without any etching 
stop layer, it avoids the bombarding damage to Cu rods underlying the dielectric layer, resulting 
from the high energy charged ions during the dielectric etching process. The trenches can be formed 
by just using the developing process of the HSQ resist. Besides, the remaining HSQ resist is able to 
be used as a mold to sustain the structure for further procedures. In this report, we show the 
multi-layered Cu photonic crystal structures fabricated with this new method and demonstrate the 
photonic band gap behavior at less than 4 µm wavelength.

二、緣由與目的  
近年來，一維及二維光子晶體因為製作容易，已經有相當多的成果在國內外被發表；但
是三維光子晶體是最理想的結構，可以獲得完全的三維光子能隙，此對於量子光電元件有相
當大的幫助，例如：低傳輸損耗及高耦合效率的多工光波導，高增益的微空腔 (High-Q 
Microcavity)，高轉換效能的熱光電壓 (Thermal PhotoVoltaic, TPV) 產生器等。壬色列理工學
院的林尚佑教授在 1998年，製作出第一個工作在紅外波長 (9~15 µm) 的三維光子晶體[1]，這
種方式的好處是設計相當簡單，並可利用半導體製程的方式製作。此晶體結構實際上是交互
疊在一起的複晶矽棒，中間的空隙為空氣，每根複晶矽棒的寬度和間距分別為 1.2 µm和 4.2 
µm，其結構為面心長方體 (Face-entered-tetragonal) 結構。在 2002 年，林教授運用相似的技
術製作三維金屬光子晶體 (Metallic Photonic Crystals, MPC)[2]，在光波波長範圍 8~20 µm內，
對於正向入射光此結構會有大於 90%的反射率，對於傾斜 60°入射光反射率仍維持超過 80%，
驗證了三維光子晶體具有全光子能隙 (Full Photonic Band Gap) 的特性。 
一般的鎢絲燈泡所發出來的光大部分浪費在中近紅外線波段，也就是廢熱，若是使用此
一結構，經由結構設計及材料的選取，可以抑制在中紅外波長的黑體輻射而使得能量集中在
可見光波段放射，故此元件可以作為高效率的光源，對於能源的節省有相當大的幫助。另外，
對於熱光電壓 (TPV) 轉換的效率也能有相當的提升，可設計三維金屬光子晶體使得熱輻射的
波長符合熱光電池最佳轉換效率的波長，對於能量轉換作最佳化。根據模型估算，使用鎢晶
格作為於理想頻率的發光體，TPV 的轉換效能達 51%[3]，相較下黑體 (完全吸收任何投射其
上之熱或光輻射的物體) 發光體只有 12.6%高出許多。 
光子晶體本身有標度率 (Scaling Law)，利用此特性若將三維金屬光子晶體尺度縮小到一

Introduction 
 
The three-dimensional (3D) metal photonic crystal is of use material for light sources [1] and 
relative optics devices in integrating optical circuit [2]. It has been suggested that the 3D metallic 
The two layers structure of periodic copper rods with rod width of 192.2 nm, layer thickness of 
185.2 nm and rod-to-rod spacing of 492 nm was observed with SEM and shown as Fig. 1. The 
dimension of real structure is deviated from the original design of 200 nm in rod thickness and 
width, and 500 nm in rod spacing. Those deviations are resulting from the processing frustration 
and those errors are all under 8%.   
                                       
Fig. 1 The SEM pictures show (a) two layers of Cu metal rod structure, and (b) dimensions of this 
structure. 
 
The transmission (T) and reflection (R) measurements were taken by the BRUKER VERTEX 70 
Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), using KBr as a beam-splitter and MCT as a 
detector, as shown in Figure 2(a). To obtain reasonable data, T and R are normalized to spectra of 
silicone wafer and Cu film with 400 nm, respectively. From these spectra, we can clearly observe a 
very high reflection (R) at a wide wavelength range. Especially for the HSQ removed sample (after 
BOE), the R value is still higher than 65% even approaching the 1 µm region. We used the Buffered 
Oxide Etch (BOE) solution (6 parts 40% NH4F and 1 part 49% HF) to etch away the HSQ and 
remain the structure of double layer of Cu rod. Therefore the dielectric difference is larger than that 
between Cu and air (before BOE sample). This result is similar with Shawn Lin’s work [3] in 
tungsten case. According to the theory of PBG, band gap is in proportion to the dielectric difference. 
From the result of R and T, the PBG effect is demonstrated with our two-layer MPC. Fig. 2(b) is the 
simulation result, which also matches measurement spectra well except its higher R and T near to 
the band edge. It is referred to the absorption from Si substrate in real case.

incident light. (b) The tilt-angle reflection measurement of two-layer Cu MPC structure with 90°

Summary 
 
In this report, we built up a method to fabricate 3D MPC, which is not only without the oxide 
etching step but also improving the quality of pattern structure, and  demonstrate its optical 
properties—PBG. In addition, this approach can economize the requirements of extra resist and 
etching process, even extremely simplify the damascene process for copper rods formation. We will 
further to check the optical behavior under the 1 µm region and particularly in thermal emission test. 
As layers of Cu rod increase, we would expect that the dependence of R on polarizations and angles 
of incident light becomes unobvious, because of its complete PBG nature.  
Therefore, it is worth to go on this work and develop a new method for fabricating the 3-D metallic 
photonic crystal.

Introduction 
 
The three-dimensional (3D) metal photonic crystal is of use material for light sources 
[1] and relative optics devices in integrating optical circuit [2]. It has been suggested 
that the 3D metallic photonic crystal may be useful for incandescent lamp applications 
and the thermal photovoltaic power generation [3]. There are several methods in 
fabrication of MPC currently all over the world [4~9]. Generally, the Cu multilayer 
fabrication is always difficulty in traditional IC foundries even in semiconductor 
laboratories. The non-compatible characteristics of Cu in Si fabrication processes are 
the major concerning issue. For that we used the E-Beam direct writing lithography 
method with the substituted photo-resist of Hydrogen Silesquioxane (HSQ) for 
Metallic Photonic Crystal (MPC) fabrication. It can avoid the bombarded damage on 
Cu rods from the high energy charged ion during the critical Silicon Oxide (SiO2) 
trench etching by just using the resist developing processing. The trench in pattern can 
be formed just by developing process within which will be fulfilled with Cu metal. 
The HSQ can be used as a mold to sustain and contain Cu lines, moreover, as a 
photo-resist. It is therefore possible to manufacture various metallic PC with smaller 
scales (200 nm in this report) to investigate specula photonic band gap behavior and 
thermal emission property owing to various intrinsic property of itself. Thus, it is 
possible to study converting effect results from thermal radiation into electricity under 
heating any different photonic band gap (PBG) sample with a thermal source [10]. In 
this study a 3D cupper photonic crystal is realized with a large infrared PBG > 1.5 µm. 
It is implied that thermal excitation can give rise to PBG emission with sharp 
emission peaks at < 1.5 µm. From the simulation there exists a sharp transmission 
peak at around 0.55 µm. If the Si substrate is removed, the performance of this sample 
will be more prominent at this wavelength. The related experiments are still under 
running.   
 
 
Experiment  
 
In this section we describe the approach to facilitate the fabrication of 3D photonic 
crystal structure. The hydrogen silesquioxane (HSQ) was used as the negative resist 
of electron beam (E-Beam) exposure system. Through the direct writing of E-beam 
(Leica, Weprint 200 type) the HSQ was exposed, following developed by TMAH, and 
then formed the grating pattern. The HSQ patterns which briefly used as the sacrificial 
dielectric to sustain 3D photonic crystal structure through each layer were obtained. 
After that, the adhesion layer of Ta metal and Cu seed layer was deposited using 
result is similar with Shawn Lin’s work [3] in tungsten case. According to the theory 
of PBG, band gap is in proportion to the dielectric difference. From the result of R 
and T, the PBG effect is demonstrated with our two-layer MPC. Fig. 2(b) is the 
simulation result, which also matches measurement spectra well except its higher R 
and T near to the band edge. It is referred to the absorption from Si substrate in real 
case.

structure by using FTIR. (b) The simulation result of transmission and reflection with 
the same structure. 
 
In order to reveal the behavior of photonic band of sample, the variable angle of 
incident light test is conducted. The incident angles of light were tilted 30°, 45° and 
60° to the normal direction of Cu layer individually. Those spectra are shown as Fig. 
3(a) and (b) corresponding to 0° and 90° polarizations, which indicate that the electric 
field is perpendicular and parallel to the orientation of Cu rod in the upper layer, 
respectively. As discussing above, the larger ε difference causes the stronger PBG 
effect. For the after BOE sample, the ε difference of double Cu layer structure would 
be difference between metal and its environment which now is air with ε value of 1. 
For another case, the difference of dielectric constant between metal and HSQ is 
smaller because ε value of HSQ is about 2.5. In both polarizations, the after BOE 
sample is of higher reflectivity than that of the before BOE sample for three incident 
angles. As θ is increased, R lowers seriously and band edge moves to longer 
wavelength. Besides, owing to the orientation of Cu rod, the cutoff effect of 
waveguide can be seen in the case of 90° polarized incident light. (In the after BOE 
sample, there are drops in spectra of R at around 3 µm. It is referred to the absorption 
of H2O in environment.)
