2. 英文摘要
Recently, the advances in the Internet technology have caused a dramatic impact on
family life. Integrating with computer technology, Internet technology, wireless
networks, and home networks, the engineers bring us a new way of family life called
digital home. How to properly manage and control home appliances must be assisted
by the management system of a digital home platform. Open Service Gateway
Initiative (OSGi) was announced to be a free and standard digital home platform.
Based on OSGi, the user can develop his own application software. However, in the
management system of a digital home platform, the user cannot manage the digital
home platform anytime in order to properly avoid any hazard. Due to this reason, the
mobile agents can be used to safely monitor the home appliances in the digital home
platform. Also, the mobile agents can automatically adjust the living environment
status and provide the user with comfort.
This project aims to model and analyze the management system of a digital home
platform integrating with OSGi and mobile agents by using Petri nets (PN) and
high-level fuzzy Petri nets (HLFPN). The main aspects of modeling and analysis
include functions, system architecture, system working status, agents’
communication, and web services. Moreover, those home network services, for
example, safeness, client using status, and server operating status, …, etc. are
explored in the same manner.
In the management system of a digital home platform with OSGi and mobile agents,
it contains a lot of target items, for instance, home appliances, security guard, home
entertainment, …, etc. All the above referenced digital home items must be
controlled by a unique management platform. If all the control processes can be
precisely simulated by PN and HLFPN prior to the implementation of a digital home
platform with OSGi and mobile agents, the design and management tasks will
become more convenient and more time-saving.
This project focuses on modeling the management system of a digital home platform
with OSGi and mobile agents by PN and HLFPN. From the PN or HLFPN, we can
use its incidence matrix to analyze the behavioral properties and structural properties
of the PN system. Herein the analysis methods include coverability tree, incidence
5所賦予的任務，具備了自主性和機動性的特質。
數位家庭技術包含了許多，也是國內資訊相關業者持續積極投入的部分，
如：遠端監控、數位居家照護、居家保全與語音、影像辨識、遠端監控、數位影
音娛樂、家電控制、控制機制與控制平台或人機介面、甚至於居家的數位學習或
遠距教學等包羅萬象。同樣的，使用圖形與數學化的分析，即 Petri Net 作狀態模
擬與各需要的數據分析，之後加入模糊理論作為一客觀的分析。
在家電控制方面，加入模糊控制以及行動代理人的技術，利用行動代理人的
特質和模糊控制，打造出以往不同的家電使用模式，如以模糊理論分析室溫，作
為冷暖氣是否運作，溫度偏高或偏低時啟動冷暖氣，提供舒適的空間，然而行動
代理人可讓使用者在遠端透過網路操控家電，能讓家電有更高效率的運作，降低
不必要的電源耗損。
數位家庭管理平台主要採用開放式管理平台(Open Service Gateway Initiative
OSGi)作為系統開發工具，管理項目可能相當繁多，如家電、門禁、娛樂系統管
理等如上述數位家庭應用的各部分，都有可能被發展在一組控制平台上來進行控
制。結合代理人技術可以使家庭內部設備透過代理人管控，使用者只需注意傳回
的警告類訊息，而不虛無時無刻的去監控家中設備。如此，在操作控制的流程上，
使用 Petri Net 來模組整個代理人控制平台，可能將控制流程的每一個狀態在實際
製作控制平台前作事前模擬，如此對平台的設計與管理會是更方便省時的。
4. 研究目的
本研究針對特定之數位家庭管理平台應用與行動代理人之結合使用，在數位
家庭管理平台方面將會使用開放式服務平台(Open Service Gateway Initiative
OSGi)為主，將代理人技術加入 OSGi 平台上並以 Petri Net 與 high-level fuzzy
Petri Net (HLFPN)理論作為模組和分析的工具。主要模組、分析層面細分成：功
能、代理人管理系統、系統架構、代理人使用狀態、系統狀態、通訊與網路服務
等層面。甚至 high-level fuzzy Petri Net (HLFPN)理論如何應用在數位家庭管理平
台上。
網路服務以通用即插即用(UPnP)為主，數位家庭中的設備會透過 UPnP 進行
通訊，並以 Petri Net 與 high-level fuzzy Petri Net (HLFPN)理論作分析的基礎，並
針對服務本身的特性做分析如：安全性、代理人狀態是否正確、操作狀態為何、
客戶端使用情形、伺服端運作情形等。
數位家庭代理人應用的部分則是以軟體工程的角度出發，Petri Net 與

6. 研究方法
6.1 研究方法與進行步驟：
一、 Petri Net 與既有論文成果 HLFPN 之研討
二、 數位家庭應用與技術標準研究
三、 選定與分析具代表性之數位家庭應用項目
四、 以模擬軟體分析和統計結果
五、 以 HLFPN 應用於數位家庭之分析與研究
六、 分析既選定數位家庭的網路應用服務範疇
6.2 Petri Net 與既有論文成果 HLFPN 之研討
Petri Net 研究討論範疇包括其基本定義與各項特性，特性分為兩大類：行為特
性、結構特性、與分析 Petri Net 的方法等。
Petri Net 理論是在 1962 年由 Dr. Carl Adam Petri 發表於其博士學位論文當
中，Petri Net 是一用途相當廣泛的工具，且是一數學化、圖形化的模組標記方法。
其定義是：假設 P, T, F 是有限集合(finite sets)，由三者組成的 N = (P, T, F)稱為
Petri Net 的結構，並遵守下面四項規則。
9Conditions Clause in logic Conclusion(s)
Buffers Processor Buffers
另外，Petri Net 特性包括兩種：行為特性(Behavioral Properties)與結構特性
(Structural Properties)
Behavioral Properties-
1) Reachability: MR(M0) ? M = AT x + M0
2) Boundedness: M(p) < ∞, pP,MR(M0) (or Safeness)
3) Liveness: different levels of liveness, L0, 1, 2, 3, 4
4) Reversibility and Home State:MR(M0), M0R(M)
5) Coverability:M1R(M0), M1(p)≧M(p),pP
6) Persistence: any enabled transition can be disabled by its own firing.
7) Synchronic Distance: between two transitions, t1 and t2.
d12= max {σ(t1) － σ(t2)}
Structural Properties-
8) Structural Liveness: if there exists a live initial marking.
9) Controllability: if any marking Mn in PN is reachable from any initial
marking M0, Rank A=|p|
10) Structural Bouundedness:
if it exists y > 0, Ay≦ 0
Y: place-vector
本計畫將利用 Petri Net 來模組化數位家庭平台管理，並以模組化以後的 Petri
Net 圖形或其 Incidence Matrix 對選定的數位家庭應用項目做分析評估；也利用各
種 Petri Net 的特性作為分析的輔助；為了讓 Petri Net 在數位家庭的領域更加實
用，也將加入各種 Petri Net 的分析方法，如 Coverability Tree、Incidence Matrix、
State Equation 、以及 Reduction Rules for Analysis，以提升分析的效率。
7. 結果與討論
7.1 High-Level Fuzzy Petri net (HLFPN)研究討論
計畫主持人在發表論文 Reinforcement Learning for High-Level Fuzzy Petri
Nets 裡提到，一 Reinforcement Petri-Net-based Fuzzy Logic Control System
(RPN-FLCS)能被用來做自動、動態的學習藉由”獎勵/懲罰”(reward/penalty)的訊
息(i.e., good/bad)或這藉由一相當簡單的模糊回饋訊息(fuzzy feedback signal)如：
11
量、weight 值、基本 Petri Net 圖形的繪製功能、與因為製作程式必須的 Incidence
Matrix 也當成一功能外，分析額外的結構或行為特性在一般免費的軟體並沒有提
供。
在研究初步，預計先使用免費的模擬軟體，如 pipe、WoPeD、hpsim 等作為
方便研討 Petri Net 架構與基本行為上使用；到了分析數位家庭與網路應用的部
分，將會希望 Petri Net 結構或行為特性能成為分析的依據，因此會需要功能較強
大並包含分析額外的結構或行為特性功能的模擬軟體。
為了增加分析的效率，模擬軟體的分析要求上除了上述基本的 Incidence
Matrix 分析方法外，也必須加強 Coverability Tree、State Equation、 Reduction Rules
for Analysis 等分析方法的功能。
另外，在軟體選用的預計還要有transition的fire自動判斷的功能，如自行判斷
除了token條件符合外，以及判斷條件是否吻合一transition能被fire，另外在加上
模糊的判斷，增強模擬分析的客觀性。
7.3 以 HLFPN 應用於數位家庭之分析與研究
模糊集合
數位家庭擁有許多設備平台假使我們能同一管理設備平台，減少多餘的能源使
用，或對居家環境的設備做適當的控制。而模糊集合，如同人們的思維模式，每
一元素可以說是將二值邏輯擴展成多值邏輯，除了以 0 和 1 來表示所屬程度之
外，並推廣至介於 0 與 1 之間的數值來表示。以上述的冷氣機為例，現在市面
已有利用模糊控制的冷氣機，它的判斷已不只是二值邏輯而是以多值邏輯方式來
判斷，將每個溫度給予某程度的值形成某一模糊集合，如表 7-1 所示，溫度 27℃
在溫度“高”集合的所屬程度為 0，在“中”集合的程度為 0.66，在“低”集合的程度
則為 0.33。模糊控制冷氣機會隨溫度的高低程度控制風速、壓縮機運轉作些微的
調整，改善了傳統冷氣機的不能維持溫度平穩和浪費電源等缺點，而計劃將
HLFPN 的技術架構應用在數位平台上做控制與管理。

7.5、行動代理人應用與技術研究
行動代理人（mobile agent）是一種能夠同時一邊在各電腦終端間移動，
一邊能夠自主地（autonomous）的執行使用者所賦予的任務的程式，跟以往代
理人技術不同的是，行動代理人更具備了自主性（Autonomy）與機動性
（mobility）。下圖為行動代理人的流程圖(如圖 2)。
圖2 行動代理人之流程圖
行動代理人之重要特徵如下：
1. 分散式處理
行動代理人以分散處理將所攜帶的程式傳送到其他電腦繼續執行，並
在傳送端 host 傳送程式碼前先行壓縮，可使其傳輸通信量減至最小限度，
以分散各電腦及網路的負擔。另外，如通信傳輸安全許可，則行動代理人
可藉由自己本身程式來直接控制，並存取其他電腦上的運算執行資源，大
為提昇其效率及靈活性。
2. 非同步處理
以分散式處理的觀點來看，在傳統主從架構（client-server Paradigm）
中運作時，client 端需一直與 server 端保持連線，否則無法正常運作，造成
網路頻寬浪費；而行動代理人技術則可解決這個問題，當傳送端 host 將程
式送到接收端 host 時，傳送與接收兩接就不需再保持連線通信，行動代理
人即可獨自在接收端 host 上執行，大幅降低網路流量。
3. 可移動性
使用者將程式、資料或是機密資料放置於行動代理人上，只需要在各
電腦或硬體裝置上安裝 run time system，各電腦便具有移動和自主的處理能
力，就能在各種異質的環境下自由移動並且執行任務。
由於行動通信和無線網路技術大幅躍進，使得行動代理人慢慢的融入到我
們日常生活中其行動代理人的應用不僅限於遠端資料查詢、分散處理，還包括
15
 紅外線人體監控。
 總電力監控。
 溫度監測。
 設備使用監控。
 一氧化碳監控。
 瓦斯監測。
 窗戶大門監控。
 危機按鈕。
 RFID 射頻辨識系統。
2. 整合式顯示系統
 家庭狀態即時顯示(電源、室溫、室內溼度、一氧化碳…等)。
 遠端家庭看診。
 遠端報警與警告。
3. 網路遠端控制系統。
 自動家庭裝置控制。
 家中狀況影像控制。
 手動控制家中設備。
功能一:
在門口或窗戶架設攝影機並以紅外線感測是否有物體侵入家中，如果感測到資
料時會將資料輸入行動代理人管理系統，行動代理人可以透過網路的傳輸與在
警局或是警衛的行動代理人系統進行通知，即時的防衛家中的安全。此功能不
僅在家中架設數位家庭管理平台之行動代理人設備，於警衛或警局亦可架設行
動代理人設施，可達到分散式代理人之應用。
功能二:
建置電力管理代理人系統，對於家中電力做有效的控管與排程，有鑑於家中火
災的發生絕大多數都是電路電壓過高導致電線走火，行動代理人可以針對所有
電器設備所使用的電力進行管控，如有設備使用過久或是出現問題導致電壓使
用過高時，行動代理人會進行管控，將問題設備重新開啟或是關閉。防止因為
無人監管的設備導致家中的災難發生。
功能三:
行動代理人管理系統可以附加在各種電器設備中，並針對各種電器設備進行最
適合的控制，例如使用者將回家時以簡訊告知代理人系統，代理人系統收到使
用者將回到家中的簡訊時預先將冷氣開至適合的溫度、電燈亮度調高、使用者
出門前放置的電鍋自動開啟、冰箱中的食材先行退冰等，透過代理人技術可以
達到一個舒適的家庭環境給使用者使用。使用者亦可手動控制家中的設備，當
代理人系統關閉時，以無線網路的方式連結家中的伺服電腦操控人機介面一樣

Abstract— This study presents an investment decision for
exchanging New Taiwan dollars to U.S. dollars using support
vector regression and fuzzy theory. First, we used a support
vector regression machine for exchanging New Taiwan dollars to
American dollars, using daily and practical prices to input data
and implement approximate trend simulations and predictions.
Second, we used a grid search to determine appropriate
parameters of the support vector regression system.
Furthermore, we used the learned model data from the
generated future exchange rate trends to analyze predictions and
technical indices combined with fuzzy decision theory for
developing an appropriate investitive decision. According to the
proposed system of managing buying and selling, investors can
investigate trends. Finally, investitive decision software systems
were implemented in a .net environment.
Keywords- Support Vector Regression; Fuzzy Theory; Grid
Search; Investment decision
Introduction
Decisions and forecasts of exchange rates have been a
crucial research topic in financial markets. Early, economists
used econometric models to analyze. Since Meese and
Rogoff proposed a random walk model in 1986, various time
series models [1] have been widely used in exchange rate
forecasts [2], [3]. However, estimation methods of these time
series models have commonly used maximum likelihood
estimation [4], thus requiring that the time series variable
satisfy the normal distribution assumption. However, a
financial time series does not have linear characteristics, and
it's volatility has a clustering effect. Furthermore, a financial
time series cannot meet the normal distribution assumption,
which lowers the predictive performance of the MLE.
Therefore, researchers have begun to study and use non-linear
and non-parametric artificial neural networks (ANNs) [5].
Although ANNs do not require a large sample of normal
distribution assumptions, and have the advantages of
non-linear characteristics, they are not the only optimal
solution, resulting in poor prediction.
Previous studies have more recently proposed a method of
stronger predictive power to solve such problems, namely the
support vector machine (SVM), that Vapnik proposed in 1995.
In contrast to the MLE and ANN that used empirical risk
minimization, the most prominent advantages of support
vector machines is that they use a structured risk minimization
error method to achieve a balance between negotiating and
forecasting. Consequently, we used the support vector
machine (SVM), fuzzy inference systems, technical index
analysis, and C# to develop an exchange rate forecasting
decision system. The proposed system can assist investors in
determining and predicting exchange rate trends.

Support Vector Machine
Support vector machines [6], [7] have been extended to
applications in biotechnology, image recognition, text
categorization, and when solving individual field
categorizations. The purpose of support vector machine is to
determine an adequate accuracy regression equation or to
recognize machine for latter unknown input to recognize.
Support Vector Regression
Support vector regression (SVR) [8] has been proposed
and used as a method of prediction in recent years. The
principle is based on statistical learning theory [9] and the
structural risk minimization principle theorem [10]. Support
vector regression involves obtaining a corresponding
relationship between independent and dependent variables
(via the function of ø) from original lower rank raised to
higher rank characteristic space, via this method to find a new
corresponding function, such that projected optimum of
prediction effect, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1: SVM concept graph
Technical index analysis
Technical analysis [11] involves analyzing behavioral
characteristics of past and present markets, as well as
applying statistics, to assist investors in objectively and
efficiently estimating market trends. The behavior of markets
includes high and low prices, variation of price, and frequency
as well as amount of time involved in various transactions.
Technical analysis is one type of stock market analysis tool. In
this paper, we apply the Williams index, BIAS index, RSI
index and PSY index to execute technical analysis.
Fuzzy theory
In 1965, control expert L.A. Zadeh proposed multi-value
logic, and later proposed another method for assessing natural
and social phenomena. However, multi-value logic has lacked
a fuzzy concept [12] with absolute explicit extension. Up to
Figure 5: Architecture of prediction systems
To determine an appropriate model, we added one type of
method called "grid search", as shown in Figure 6. We
established input parameters c, p, and g as limits, allowing
users to determine appropriate parameter and ranges by
themselves.
Figure 6: Grid search concept graph
Fuzzy decision
The size of a technical index is divided into three
conditions, namely, high, middle, and low; further divided
into three sets of high, middle, and low. Furthermore, the
three sets correspond to the S-Type, Λ-Type, and Z-Type,
respectively. In addition, investitive decision also divides to
buy and sell two conditions. Therefore, the two sets of buying
and seling belong to the Λ-Type of membership degree.
In this paper, we use four technical indexes, namely
Williams, BIAS, RSI, and PSY. In addition, we used
prediction value of SVR to calculate one index to modify
other indexes. As a result, the high, middle, and low levels of
each technical index representing a numerical range that is not
equivalent. Therefore, to satisfy practical conditions, we
define the high, middle, and low levels of each technical
index as corresponding to membership function. The technical
index membership function is listed in Table 1. Investment
decision membership function is listed in Table 2.

(7) Average price of ten days × 1.07.
Table 2 Investitive decision membership function

10 40 70 30 60 90
According to the fuzzy set and membership function
established as above, we input each technical index to a
fuzzifier, and calculate the technical index to get the
membership degree of each set. Based on the size of a
technical index, we transform it to「If…then…」statement in
order to establish a rule database, as shown in Table 3.
Table 3 Rule database for proposed systems
Rule 1 … 122 … 243
If WMS High … Middle … Low
If BIAS High … Middle … Low
If RSI High … Middle … Low
If PSY High … Middle … Low
If SVR High … Middle … Low
Then Sell … Sell … Buy
According to the established rule database, comparing the
fuzzifier technical index with the rule database performs an
approximate inference. We use the standard fuzzy set
operators, Mamdani implication, and product inference engine
as follows:
Fuzzy union:
   xBxAxBA ,max (1)
Fuzzy intersection:
   xBxAxBA ,min (2)
Funny complement:
We can obtain the difference between the SVR learning
method and the neural network, as listed in Table 5. From
Table 5, we can see that the SVR learning method can get
better forecast graphs. Thus, it can adjust parameters to avoid
over-learning and regional optimization. If we can
appropriately adjust the parameters size and make the MSE
small enough, then we can avoid learning failure resulted
from learning too many critical points. Although the SVR can
solve the problems of neural networks, there are other existing
problems. Such problems will be solved by scholars in a
better way in the future. In other words, the SVR learning
method can perform better than the neural network.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we present an investment decision for
exchanging New Taiwan dollars to American dollars using
support vector regression and fuzzy theory. We used daily
exchange rate data to generate the Williams index, BIAS
index, RSI index, and PSY index. We integrated these indices
and the predictive outputs of foreign currency with the SVR
and fuzzy decision. That is, after using the SVR to predict
foreign currency and calculating the Williams index, BIAS
index, RSI index, and PSY index, we further combined with
fuzzy theory to execute approximate inferences and determine
an appropriate investitive decision, according to the trends
affecting the buying or selling of investors. Finally, the
investitive decision software systems were implemented in
a .net environment.

1. Introduction
Wealth management [1] is an important issue
in the financial domain. As information technology
grows dramatically and the financial market of
Taiwan turns out to be active, the investment
management becomes very popular in recent years.
To facilitate the rapid development of information
technology and the financial market, the
application of information to financial investment
becomes an important issue as essential evaluation
metrics. The goal of this paper is to model business
behavior of the financial investment by the
high-level fuzzy Petri net (HLFPN) [2], [3], [4] for
developing an application system. This paper
focuses on modeling the business behavior of
financial investment systems by the high-level
fuzzy Petri net (HLFPN) for the purpose of
developing an appropriate investment decision.
Based on the high-level fuzzy Petri net model, the
proposed system provides individual investors to
obtain relevant information to understand the
investment trend. As a result, we propose a
practical financial investment system to enhance
investment benefits and to help investors achieve
the desired goals so as to improve the economy.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we briefly review some basic
definitions of high level fuzzy Petri nets [2], [3],
[4]. Then, we describe the HLFPN model for fuzzy
reasoning.
2.1. Definitions
Definition 2.1: The HLFPN is defined as an
8-tuple:
, , ,( , , , , )HLFPN P T F C V  ,
where
1 2 3 , ..., }{ , , kpP p p p A finite set of places;
1 2 3{ , , , ..., }lT t t t t A finite set of transitions;
3) MISO represents the
multiple-input-single-output, i.e.,
jt T  ,
1|)(| jtI and | ( ) | 1jO t  .
4) MIMO represents the
multiple-input-multiple-output, i.e.,
jt T  ,
1|)(| jtI and | ( ) | 1jO t  .
Definition 2.8 (Cyclic HLFPN): In the HLFPN,
for the subnet or the whole net, if an IP or OP is not
empty and a path exists, then we call it a cyclic
HLFPN.
Definition 2.9 (Heterogeneous Outputs): In the
HLFPN, if outputs possess different attributes, then
we call them heterogeneous outputs.
2.2. Fuzzy Reasoning
In the fuzzy reasoning method presented in [5],
fuzzy production rules are used. In general, a fuzzy
production rule describes fuzzy relationships
between antecedent and consequents. Let R be a set
of fuzzy production rules, where
1 2{ , , ..., }nR R R R .
The general form of the ith fuzzy production rule
Ri is shown as follows:
Ri: IF dj(X is A), THEN dk(Y is B); ELSE, dw(Z is
C)…(V).
where“X is A”,“Y is B”and“Z is C”are
propositions; X is called the input linguistic
variable; Y and Z are called the output linguistic
variables, respectively; A is called the input fuzzy
set; B and C are called the output fuzzy sets,
respectively; the fuzzy truth values of the
propositions“X is A”,“Y is B”and“Z is C” are 
restricted to [0, 1];“X is A”is the antecedent of the
fuzzy production rule Ri;“Y is B”and“Z is C”are
the consequences of the fuzzy production rule Ri;
Let V represent the fuzzy relational matrix between
the antecedent and the consequences of a fuzzy
production rule.
2.3. Fuzzy Reasoning Algorithm
In this section, we briefly review a fuzzy
reasoning algorithm (FRA) from [3] to determine
whether there exists a fuzzy relational matrix
between the antecedent and the consequence of a
fuzzy production rule.

In this section, we use an example to illustrate
the viability of the fuzzy reasoning process. The
result of each calculation is represented by two
digits of significant numbers. Then, we compare
the results of the proposed HLFPN-based
algorithm with the existing methods.
Assume that WMS (W), RSI (R) and PSY (P)

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented an investment
decision method for Taiwan stock market using
high level fuzzy Petri nets. We used the data of the
daily stock price to generate the Williams index,
the relative strength index, and the psychological
index. We integrated these indices into fuzzy
reasoning algorithm of the HLFPN model to
perform fuzzy reasoning to determine an
appropriate investment decision. Based on the
high-level fuzzy Petri net model, the proposed
system provides individual investors to obtain
relevant information to understand the investment
trend. We have proposed a practical financial
investment system to enhance investment benefits
and to help investors achieve the desired goals to
improve the economy.

Abstract:
This scheme is based on elliptic curve multiplication
property, bilinear pairing, one-way hash function, and the
time-bound access control. It is applied to construct a
time-bound hierarchical access control and key management for
a multicast system. The system has many security classes and
the CA is a central authority which assigns a group key and
time-bound secret keys to every security class and all class
members. CA uses different group keys to encrypt different
multicast data. Then, the member decrypts the multicast data
using a time-bound secret key to obtain a group key. In the
security analysis, we consider many different possible malicious
attacks by using the time-bound secret key and the group key.
Finally, we simulate it to analyze the system security.
Keywords:
Elliptic curve; Bilinear pairing; Key management; Access
control; Multicast system
1. Introduction
With fast advance in the technology, the
secure multicasting is an important technology in
the network. In the past, when sending the data, we
usually used broadcast or peer to peer nodes.
Nowadays, as fast advances in the network, the
unicast and broadcast are not efficient. Therefore,
the benefit of using secure multicasting is for
delivering data safely from one sender to multiple
recipients.
The multicast system has very wide
applications, but the system safety is worth
exploring how to prevent from malicious attacks.
In this paper, we focus on the system safety. We
combine the hierarchical access control [1] with a
multicast system and we join the concept of time
bound to constrain the access control. In the
hierarchical access control, it means that the
predecessor classes can access the multicast data of
successor classes, but the successor classes cannot
access the multicast data of predecessor classes.
Hence, the system is assumed to be m different
security classes. In the m different classes, ≦
denotes a binary partially-ordered relationship in
the set SC={ SC1,SC2,SC3……,SCm }. In the
partially ordered set, SCi≦SCj means that the SCj
security class is higher than the SCi security class.
Obviously, how to ensure the multicast data in
the time- bound hierarchical access control of a
multicast system cannot be obtained by malicious
user, which is very important issue.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we first discuss some
mathematic backgrounds regarding elliptic curve,
bilinear pairing, one way hash function, and
time-bound hierarchical key management scheme.
Then, we describe the proposed scheme for some
mathematic reasoning.
2.1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography
In 1987, the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem was
proposed by N. Koblitz [2]. The elliptic curve
cryptography was able to improve the existing
have common feature of bilinear pairings. First, let
p be a big prime such that q|p-1 for some large
prime q and let G1, G2 be denoted by two cyclic
groups of the common prime order q, where G1 is a
subgroup of the additive group of points on an
elliptic curve E over Fp, and G2 is a group of the
group of the multiplicative group of a finite field
F*p. The bilinear map function is 211:ˆ GGGe  ,
which satisfies the following conditions:
1. Bilinear
(1). ê (P+Q, R) = ê (P, R)·ê (Q, R)
(2). ê (P, Q+R) = ê (P, Q)·ê (P, R)
(3). ê (aP, bQ) = ê (bP, aQ)= ê (P, Q)ab
for all P, Q, R∈G1 and a, b∈Zq*.
2. Non-degenerate
If P is a generator of group G1, then ê (P, P) is a
generator of group G2, There exists ê (P, P)≠1.
3. Computable
There exist efficient algorithms to compute ê (P, Q)∈G2
in polynomial time for all P, Q∈ G1.
However, in order to analyze the security of system in
the field of cryptology, it is essential to suppose some
problems which are approved. We use the bilinear pairing
Diffie-Hellman problem (BDHP) as a bilinear pairing in this
paper. Let 211:ˆ GGGe  be defined as follows: Given P,
aP, bP, cP∈G1, W∈G2 where a, b, c are random numbers
from Zq*, it is infeasible to compute group element
2
,,),(ˆ GPPeW cba  without knowing a, b or c.
2.3. One Way Hash Function
A one way hash function is usually represented
by H(-), and it has two main characteristics:
1. The one way function means that it breaks up
and reconstructs the file message, but the
message cannot be restored to the original
message.
2. The hash function aims to input an
arbitrary-length message x and to output
fixed-length message y.
The mathematical formula is denoted by:
yxH )(
A hash function is a one-to-one function, where
x is an arbitrary-length message and y is a
fixed-length message generated by the hash
function. It means that it can break up the
arbitrary–length message and reconstruct a
fixed-length message.
In addition to this feature, the hash function
must satisfy three conditions below:
1. For any given variable x, H(x) is easy to
compute the corresponding message y.
2. Given the message y, it is difficult from y to
calculate value x’, so we get H(x’) = y.
3. For any given variable x, finding any y≠x so
that H(y) = H(x) is computationally infeasible.
According to the previous two main
characteristics, it is easy to input an
arbitrary-length message and a fixed-length
message generated by the hash function calculation,
and vice versa is infeasible. This is an irreversible
characteristic.
2.4. Time-bound Hierarchical Key Management Scheme
In 2004, Chien [5] proposed a time-bound
hierarchical key assignment scheme based on a
tamper-resistant device and a secure hash function.
But this scheme has a security drawback. Therefore,
Shang and S. Wangstaff Jr. [6] proposed a new
scheme which is based on the elliptic curve
cryptography and the hierarchical structure to
inspire Chien’s idea. The purpose is to restrict the
user to access the information in the class SCj at
specific time interval so that this scheme combines
the key management with the concept of time
bound. This scheme supposes that the system has
already generated many different classes of nodes
marked with the policy configurations which are
the set of policies applied to a node. Then the
system will generate the class key Kj of the class
SCj according to the following steps.
1. The system’s owner chooses an eliptic curve 
3.1. Key Generation Phases
First, CA will assign a group key (gk) and
secret function f(kG) for each security class and all
class members and then CA will set up the
execution time and access control policy of the
system. Second, CA will construct the hierarchical
access control and key management structure, and
the key generation phases are described as follow:
Step 1: CA selects a bilinear map ê:G1 ×
G1→G2 and P0∈G1.
Step 2: CA generates three one way hash
functions:

Step 3: Assume that a security class SCj has n
legitimate members, which are denoted
by Uj={Uj,1,Uj,2,Uj,3,Uj,4, Uj,5, …Uj,v…., 
Uj,n} in the security class SCj. CA sets an
elliptic curve equation y2=x3+ax+b mod
p to satisfy D=4a3+27b2≠0 mod p
condition and selects a base point G over
elliptic curve. In the system, CA takes
every member ID of SCj class members,
denoted by Kj,v, and based on G point to
compute the elliptic curve multiplication.
The obtained point is denoted by Kj,vG.
Then, CA performs two values (xj,v , yj,v)
multiplication of the point Kj,vG, where
the result is denoted
by )()( ,,, vjvjvj yxGKf  and assign it to each
member.
Step 4: CA random selects a large primeαand
sets up the time-bound interval [t1,t2] for
every security class. CA sets the
execution time (ET) of the system and
combines the function f(kj,vG) with
access time t for developing the
time-bound secret key (tsk). Then, CA
defines the encrypt information

Step 5: CA random selects two primesγ,μ∈ Zq*
and computes R=γ×P0 as public

Step 6: Every security class (SC) has its own ID.
For example, the ID of SCj is called
IDSCj. CA will compute IDSCj by one way
hash function )(1 jj SCSC IDHQ  and compute
jj SCSC

MSCj is secret.
Step 7: CA constructs a polynomial MECTj(x)

Step 9: CA computes S=μ×R and W=μ×P0, and
declares them publicly.
Step 10: CA computes the group key gkj using
the secret parameter MSCj and the public
parameter W by bilinear pairing and one
way hash function. Then, CA will assign

4.2. The Collusion Attack
The collusion attack means that a lot of
security classes want to derive the unauthorized
keys to obtain the confidential multicast data by
collecting the related public parameters they
process. However, even though several security
classes cooperate to collect the related public
parameters and their own secret parameter, it is
hard to obtain the predecessor group key. There are
two reasons: First, it did not know the predecessor
access time and the time-bound interval. Second,
we compute the related parameters through
methods of bilinear pairing over elliptic curve and
one-way hash function, it is infeasible to obtain the
multicast data from H(-) applied to the multicast
data and to compute it without solving the BDHP.
Hence, the collusion attack is infeasible.
4.3. The Contrary Attack
The contrary attack means that a successor
with the related public parameters and group key
attempts to obtain the group key of the immediate
or any predecessor. We suppose that the security
class SCi wants to obtain the group key gkj of
predecessor security class SCj. Then, SCi will
attempt to obtainγand use the public parameter
QSCj andγto obtain MSCj. However, it is hard to
obtain the secret parameterγ. Becauseγexists the
Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem
(ECDLP):
jj SCSC
QM  , it is a NP complete
problem. Therefore, it is infeasible to the successor
security class SCi obtain the group key gkj by using
the secret parameter MSCj of predecessor security
class SCj. Hence, the contrary attack is infeasible.
4.4. The Sibling Attack
The sibling attack means that one among the h
successors SC has a common predecessor SC
attempts to obtain the other successor’s group key
through the related public parameters. Let the
binary partially-ordered relationship be SCx≦SCz
and SCy≦SCz , the member Ux,n in SCx which
attempts to obtain the group key gky in SCy through
the public parameters, MECT(x), and GHB(x)
polynomial. But it is hard to obtain the group key
gky in SCy. There are two reasons: First, the Ux,n
attempts to obtain the group key gkz in SCz.
According to the contrary attack, it is infeasible.
Second, the Ux,n takes gkx into the GHBy(x)
polynomial and obtains the group key gky. But it is
hard to obtain the secret parameterγ. Becauseγ
exists the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm
Problem (ECDLP):
jj SCSC
QM  , it is a NP
complete problem. Hence, the sibling attack is
infeasible.
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a time-bound
hierarchical access control and key management
for the multicast system. Our scheme can protect
the confidential multicast data by using mathematic
methods of elliptic curve multiplication property,
bilinear pairing over elliptic curve, and one-way
hash function. Besides, we join the concept of time
bound to constrain the access control. The concept
can raise security of key management and the
management efficiency and also can avoid
malicious attacks, such as the contrary attack, the
collusion attack, the sibling attack, and the exterior
