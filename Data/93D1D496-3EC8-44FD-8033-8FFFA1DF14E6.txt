 Points of CAN Communication Arbitration #1 
What is arbitration? 
It means that when two or more units start transmitting 
at the same time , the arbitration fields of data are compared 
bitwise to determine which message has priority. 
Mechanism Of arbitration  
In CAN communication, the unit that has started 
transmitting first during a bus idle state gains the right to 
transmit . If two or more units start sending at the same time , 
they are arbitrated for contention by comparing their 
arbitration fields bitwise and the unit that has more dominant 
bits than other units gains the right to transmit.

 CAN Communication Hardware 
Synchronization 
Synchronization in CAN communication has  2 
methods. In CAN communication, the timing of operation 
between each unit is sure to delay because there is a clock 
error or a bus delay, so each unit has to synchronize timing of 
operation respectively. 
 Hardware synchronization 
When a recessive to dominant edge is detected while 
the bus remains idle, each unit adjusts the timing to the edge 
as beginning of a message and starts transmitting or 
receiving.

Resynchronization  
Resynchronization 
A mistimed operation between each unit that may occur 
during transmission or reception is resynchronized. 
Here, operation is synchronized with respect to a recessive to 
dominant edge.

4 Design and Implementation of Advanced Vehicle 
Control with CAN and MOST Networks 
The experiment plant can be divided into three parts: 
P-bus (Powertrain bus), I-bus (Instrument bus), and O-bus 
(Optical bus). 
 
 
Figure 19 
The data link connector can access both the P-bus and 
the I-bus. With an adapter, Tech2 can be connected to the 
data link connector and can communicate with the different 
control modules on the P-bus and I-bus. Diagnostic 
communication with the control modules on the O-bus occurs 
via the ICM, which functions as a "gateway". 
Certain information sent by a control module is made 
available to all other bus control modules. The CIM relays 
information between the I-bus and P-bus. The ICM makes 
sure that information available on the I-bus and P-bus is 
available on the O-bus, and vice versa. 
A bus is the leads over which information is sent 
digitally and serially. Digital means that the signal is either 1 
or 0. Serial means that the information is sent in "packages" 
in close succession. 
All the control modules in the car are connected via 
three buses. Two of these buses are electrical while the third 
is optical. 
The two electrical buses are the P-bus (Powertrain bus) 
and I-bus (Instrument bus). The P-bus has two leads and the 
I-bus one lead. The difference in voltage between the two 
leads (P-bus) or the lead and ground (I-bus) is either 0 V or 
roughly 5 V. The information is coded so that different 
combinations of pulses, with the values 0 V and 5 V, have 
different meanings. 
The optic bus is known as the O-bus and has an 
extremely high capacity. It is primarily used to send audio 
signals, e.g. from the radio receiver or CD changer to the 
amplifiers. Digital information is transmitted in a plastic 
cable by pulsating the sound at low and high intensities to 
thereby form 1s and 0s. 
The experiment plant is shown in the following figures. 
 
Figure 20 
 
4-1. P-bus and I-bus 
The two electrical buses are connected to the Column 
Integration Module (CIM), Infotainment Control Module 
(ICM) and data link connector. The buses are electrically 
isolated. The CIM and ICM are gateways, transferring 
information between the buses. The CIM relays information 
between the electrical buses. The ICM makes sure that

intensity. Insufficient light intensity can be experienced as a 
rattling from the audio system, similar to atmospheric 
interference. 
 
4-3 O-bus ring break position 
To find the position of a break on the O-bus, Tech 2 
provides a function called "O-Bus Ring Break Position". To 
diagnose using the “O-Bus Ring Break Position" function in 
Tech 2, the car must be without electrical power for 4 
minutes if it is equipped with AMP2, or 1 minute for all other 
versions. 
Interference on the O-bus due to short-lived breaks or 
excessive dampening in the optical fibers may not be 
displayed as breaks on Tech 2. 
Therefore, all O-bus control modules provide diagnosis 
and generate a DTC if they receive a corrupt message. All 
messages received are converted into electrical signals, 
reconverted into light and retransmitted. The ICM is the bus 
master and, unlike the other modules, never resends a corrupt 
message. If a control module receives a corrupt message, the 
fault must have occurred upstream, somewhere between the 
control module and the ICM. This means that a fault will 
generate a DTC for an intermittent bus fault in all the control 
modules downstream. 
Fault diagnosis follows the standard fault diagnosis 
procedure: check the power supply to the control module and 
check the optical fiber. To avoid having to remove large parts 
of the car, use the fibre optic test cable, part no. 86 12 913. 
Connecting this cable between two control modules allows 
fault diagnosis to determine whether the optical cable needs 
to be changed. Also to facilitate fault diagnosis, the O-bus 
control modules have fault counters. A counter counts up 
each time bus communication is broken. The counters stops 
at 255 and can be reset with Tech 2. A counter showing 255 
must be reset to be of any use. Intermittent faults can then be 
detected by jiggling the harness. This means that a fault will 
cause all the control modules downstream to count up. The 
counters are very sensitive and generally show 255, even 
after a short period of time. Starting the engine and the 
activation of the O-bus when the radio is turned on usually 
cause the value of the counters to increase a couple of digits. 
 
4-3. C-cable 
A C-cable is a communications lead, which in actual 
fact is a single-wire bus for slow communication between two 
modules. Such a lead has a maximum transfer rate of 10 
kbit/s. Communication is serial and bi-directional. The 
diagnostic tool is connected to the bus, as are all control 
modules. All the same, there are a number of C-cables.  
Most often, one or both of the modules use a pull-up 
resistor to raise the voltage on the lead to close on B+. 
Transmission and reception then take place in accordance 
with a predetermined protocol. 
Component manufacturers use the protocol as a 
standard for message structure to avoid misunderstandings. 
 
4-4. Vehicle speed 
The TC/ABS or ESP control module measures vehicle 
speed with the help of a Hall sensor at each wheel. The sensor 
supplies the control module with alternating current, the 
amplitude and frequency of which increase with increasing 
wheel speed. The ECM calculates the average speed of the 
two non-driven wheels, correcting this value for the type of 
tire. The ECM sends this value for vehicle speed over the bus 
making it available to other systems. 
 
Figure 22 
In the table of bus messages, you can see that the ECM 
sends the value for vehicle speed and that the majority of 
other control modules use this. 
 
5 Conclusion 
The application of MOST technology in multimedia 
automobile network with the research on CAN/LIN buses 
have been explored in this report. There are many benefits for 
adopting MOST technology instead of traditional vehicle bus 
system. It supports direct point-to-point, token ring, star, rings 
incorporating splitters connections. There can have up to 
sixty-four devices on each MOST 
network.
 
Figure 22 Imaginary IC’s Filter Graph of A/V Stream 
Rendering 
In our original design, a DirectShow rendering filter for 
the MOST PC Interface is essential to transmit the required 
A/V stream to the MOST network. Figure 22 is an imaginary 
IC’s filter graph of rendering a video file. Ideally, the source 
file in Stage 1 can be of any video format since there are 
always transform filters in Stage 2 suitable for it. Furthermore, 
a transform filter with the required output format (e.g. 
MPEG-2 TS), which connects Stage 2 and Stage 3 is usually 
available. In fact, every component in this figure is attainable 
nowadays except for the renderer in Stage 3.  
With a multimedia player implementing the IC’s filter 
graph in Figure 6, there will be many advantages including 
the follows: 
1. The video is transferred and streamed instantaneously 
when being played that control of the video is made possible 
by the media player program (e.g. to pause or to jump to any
