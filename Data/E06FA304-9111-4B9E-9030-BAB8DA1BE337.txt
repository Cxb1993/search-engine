In this report, we describe an optimized molecularly imprinted method for rapid and 
effective determination of Neu5Ac, ManNAc and Man (Figure.1) by equilibrium 
adsorption experiment. Compared to other methods, this method can be more 
convenient and simple with good chemical, thermal and mechanical properties.

(Neu5AC), (B): N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) and (C): D-mannose (Man). 
In this study, two different template/monomer systems are examined: (a) 
Neu5Ac/methacrylic acid (MAA); (b) Neu5Ac/ 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP). It was observed 
that different monomers interact very differently with the template molecules, 
depending on the chemical properties of the template molecule. During imprinting, 
the template creates a specifically imprinted cave in the polymer with a permanent 
memory to recognize the template. After removal of the template molecule, the 
polymer can be used a selective binding medium for structurally related compounds. 
Selectivity of the MIP was evaluated by measuring its ability to resolve structural 
analogs in the adsorption process. The selectivity experiment demonstrates that the 
Neu5Ac-MIPs are able to recognize the structural differences between the template 
and its analogs, including different sizes of the adjacent substituent on the C9 in the 
Neu5Ac structure. Affinity and selectivity evaluation indicated that an imprinted 
polymer is a potential separation material having selectivity for Neu5Ac.  
 
Results and discussion 
When Neu5Ac was chosen as the template, polymerization occurred non-covalently 
among the functional monomer, the cross linker and the template in the presence of 
DMF via hydrogen bonding. The polymer materials were ground into powder and the 
fraction had a particle size ranging from 11 to 25 and 25 to 44μm (Table 1).

The template was extracted from the polymer using MeOH/AcOH (9:1(v/v)) solution.

The proposed method was applied to the selectivity of Neu5Ac and other similar 
structure compounds. Most imprinted polymers were synthesized using EGDMA as 
cross-linker and MAA or 4-VP as functional monomers by light or heat initated 
polymerization [17-19]. The Neu5Ac molecule has carboxyl and five hydroxyl groups. 
These groups can form a hydrogen bond with functional monomers after removing 
the template, thereby leaving a three-dimensional molecular imprint. The recognition 
properties of MIP are due both to the arrangement of the functional groups of the 
monomer units around the print molecules and to the MIPs’ shape or size. In order to 
remove the template molecules, it is necessary to break the hydrogen bond between 
template molecule and carboxyl or pyridine groups of the polymer by washing with an 
excess amount of the 9:1(v/v) MeOH/AcOH.  
The absorptivities and binding recovery of Neu5Ac and other compounds from four 
MIPs are shown in Table 2. Comparison of the data demonstrates the difference in 
their selectivities. High binding recoveries for Neu5Ac were obtained in the 94.54% 
and 92.51% for PA1 and PA2 polymers, 91.94% and 91.91% for PB1 and PB2 
polymers. PA and PB could almost completely absorb the print molecule Neu5Ac. By 
contrast, low binding recoveries were obtained with the mannose at 41.17% and 
37.57% for PA1 and PA2 polymers, at 66.72% and 49.77% for PB1 and PB2 
polymers. The binding recoveries with ManNAc were 56.71% and 47.75% for PA1 
and PA2, 53.77% and 39.59% for PB1 and PB2 polymers. Neu5Ac has 3-carbon 
alkylchain and its carboxyl or hydroxyl group could form a strong hydrogen-bonding 
complex with MAA or a remaining pyridine group. This binding may coordinate two or 
more functional groups of the polymer in a favorable position. ManNAc and mannose 
seemed that they have difficulty in diffusing into the molecularly imprinted sites; and 
would encounter interference due to steric hindrance and weak, non-specific 
hydrophobic interactions with the MIPs. Therefore binding strength between the 
resulting MIP site and the analyse compounds is weaker than binding with the well-
position MIP functional groups. This causes the relative low recoveries of Man and 
ManNAc from the MIP (PA and PB). The binding recoveries of blank polymers (PC

The Langmuir adsorption isotherm equation is one of the most widely used models to 
describe the equilibrium behaviors of adsorbate uptake, especially when an 
adsorbate (A) adsorbs to an adsorbent or a solid phase that contains specific binding 
sites (B).  
According to Hammes [20], the number (q) of moles of A bound per mole of B can be 
expressed as:
