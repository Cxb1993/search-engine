 Along the ascending auditory pathways, the midbrain (or inferior colliculus) is an important center 
where the selective sensitivity to FM first emerges (Felsheim and Ostwald, 1996; Poon et al., 1991, 1992; 
Rees and Møller, 1983; review see Rees and Malmierca, 2006). Characteristically, these FM-sensitive 
neurons respond to tones of rapidly varying frequency, but not to pure tones. Computational attempts have 
been made to predict FM responses at the midbrain and cortex. Again, results are not satisfactory, 
especially in predicting responses to naturally-occurring sounds as expected from the nonlinear behavior of 
central circuits (Aertsen et al., 1981b; Machens et al., 2004; Theunissen et al., 2000; Valentine and 
Eggermont, 2004; review see Escabi and Read, 2005). 
 
One common modeling strategy makes use of the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF; Aertsen et al., 
1981a; Depireux et al., 2001; Eggermont et al., 1983; Hermes et al., 1981; Klein et al., 2000; Miller et al., 
2002;; review see Young, 2010). STRF is used to represent on the time-frequency plane the input-output 
relationship of central auditory neurons. Typically, a probe tone of randomly varied frequency is used to 
evoke spike responses from an FM-sensitive cell (deCharms et al., 1998; Poon and Yu, 2000; Escabi and 
Schreiner, 2002; Theunissen et al., 2000). To construct the STRF, the analysis involves averaging the 
random sound energy preceding each spike. Band-like concentrations of energy appear in the STRF of 
FM-sensitive cells, at pre-spike intervals consistent with the neural transmission time measured from the 
auditory periphery to where the cell is recorded. These band-like structures form presumed ‘trigger features’ 
that determine the spike responses (analogous to the concept of receptive field in sensory physiology). In 
the STRF, trigger features of a variety of patterns have been reported (e.g., rising, falling orientations 
representing FM sensitivity or a flat orientation representing pure tone sensitivity; examples see Atencio et 
al., 2007; Chiu and Poon, 2007). Often the exact patterns of trigger features depend on the properties of 
sound stimuli used to generate them (Valentine and Eggermont, 2004). The host of stimuli used to generate 
STRFs ranges from random tonal stimuli to naturally-occurring complex sounds (e.g., Escabi and Schreiner, 
2002; Poon and Yu, 2000; Theunissen et al., 2000). No attempt has been made on incorporating temporal 
information from STRF into artificial neural networks to predict FM responses. 
 
In this study, we made use of two kinds of temporal information derived from the STRF to predict the 
cell’s response to FM sounds with an artificial neural network: (a) the ‘time window’ containing the trigger 
feature, and (b) the ‘delay time’ measured from the time of spike occurrence to the proximal end of the 
trigger feature. 
 
2. Results 
 
Figure 1 shows typical responses of an FM-sensitive cell. Results are shown for the response to a slow 
FM (tone-1, Fig. 1A, non-identical stimuli across 60 trials) and to a fast FM (tone-2 and tone-3, Fig. 1B, 
  
Fig. 2: STRFs of 10 FM-sensitive cells in response to slow FM (tone-1; left columns: A1 to J1) and fast FM 
(tone-2 and tone-3; right columns: A2 to J2). In this and other similar plots, the overlap of frequency 
time-profiles at each pixel is color coded, with ‘hot’ areas representing high overlaps or the trigger features. 
In each panel, ‘n’ is the number of stimulus time profiles, and the spike occurrence marked by the vertical 
dashed line. 
 
Most of the 10 FM-sensitive cells displayed strong response directionality, i.e., preferring one direction 
of FM sweep (Fig. 2). Within the pre-spike time window of about 5 to 29 ms, concentration of the 
modulating waveforms formed apparent ‘hot bands’ in the STRFs, typically situated above or below the 
carrier frequency (or also best frequency, BF, of the cell). The orientation of the hot band represents the 
preference of individual neurons to the direction of the FM stimulus (8 up-, and 2 down- sweep). The 
average time interval between the proximal end of the hot band and the time of spike occurrence is 8.04 
(±3.93 SD) ms, which represents the central transmission delay from the cochlea to the spike generating 
mechanism of the cell. These FM-sensitive cells (or sometimes called ‘FM-specialized’ cells) represented 
about 1/3 of the click-responsive neurons in the rat auditory midbrain (Poon et al., 1991, 1992; Poon and 
Chiu, 2000; Chiu and Poon, 2007). These 10 neurons were selected (from a population of 15 FM-sensitive 
cells) based on their STRFs which showed a simple trigger feature. Neurons with more complex STRFs 
were not included in the study (e.g., containing both up and down FM sweeps, and/or with multiple FM 
 by the contour, the model performance was high and often showed striking similarity in the PSTH plots 
(supplementary Fig. 2). 
 
For simple artificial neural networks (with single neuron in the hidden layer) like the present one, it is 
possible to examine in more details the weighting functions obtained at different combinations of time 
window and delay time. Figure 5 (and supplementary Fig. 3) shows the various weighting functions within 
the region of high performance (Figure 4). Some consistent features are apparent. Firstly, heavily weighted 
elements (or ‘bump-like’ structures) are consistently observed in the weighting function, when the cells 
showing preferred sensitivity to up-sweep FM. In their STRFs, the ‘bumps’ appeared like ‘valleys’ in the 
case of a preference to down-sweep FM. These features are clearly seen at long time windows and short 
delay times. In general, the duration of the ‘bumps’ (or ‘valleys) tended to overlap with the time window of 
trigger feature, supporting the importance of trigger features in the modeling. Secondly, at certain 
combination of time window and time delay near that of the trigger feature, multiple peak-like structures 
were often observed riding on the ‘bumps’ (or ‘valleys’), suggesting synaptic activations.

results (red). To visualize details, responses to the 1 sec long stimulation are displayed in 2 time segments. 
Note the large overlaps. Cell labels correspond to those in Figure 2. 
  
While the positive weight values are likely more consistent with excitation, the negative values should 
be viewed with more caution, as they cannot be considered simply as inhibition. Since during training, the 
FIRNN was to best estimate the PSTH profile, which contains periods of spike responses as well as no 
response. The weighting function of the trained FIRNN was then convolved with the modulating time 
waveform of the test dataset (expressed as positive and negative values with respect to the carrier frequency) 
to predict the response. What the model had to consider was apparently: (a) the temporal features of the 
frequency sweep (up- or down-FM, its rate of change, and the extent of modulation), and (b) which side 
with respect to the BF of the cell the FM stimulus had occurred (i.e., frequency range above or below the 
BF). In other words, one may consider that the FIRNN was basically modeling the integration of synaptic 
inputs that landed on dendritic field of the cell traversing ‘iso-frequency’ laminae likely on either side of the 
cell body (Poon et al., 1992). 
 
Inhibition is known to be involved in FM detection (Fuzessery and Hall, 1996; Gittelman et al., 2009) 
and the auditory midbrain is known to be rich in inhibitory mechanisms (including post-inhibitory rebound; 
Sivaramakrishnan and Oliver, 2001; review see Casseday et al 2002). It is conceivable that some inhibitory 
influences might have been taken care of by the self-adjusted FIRNN weightings, the involvement of 
inhibition especially at higher stimulus levels remains to be explored. As the spike occurrence determines 
when to capture the pre-spike modulating waveform, periods of ‘inhibition’ which appears 
indistinguishable from ‘no response’ cannot be studied easily with this spike-average approach. 
 
Major differences exist between a previous FIRNN model (Chang et al., 2003) and the present one. 
First, the current method has a simple architecture (3 layers, with 1+1+1, or a total of 3, neurons from the 
input to output layers). In contrast, the previous model has a more complicated architecture (4 layers, with 
an architecture of 1+10+10+1, or a total of 22, neurons from input to output with somewhat arbitrary delays 
times), and it needs to separate the modeling of strong and weak PSTH responses (again at somewhat 
arbitrary peak levels). More importantly, the previous approach is a phenomenological model. Secondly, the 
present model is based on biologically relevant information in the STRF (assuming spectral integration of 
inputs over a specific time window and the output is generated after a transmission delay). In contrast, the 
previous model yields a total of 20 weighting functions for neurons in the 2 hidden layers, and the functions 
are harder to relate to the underlying biology. Thirdly, the present model finishes computation typically 
within 30 min, compared to about 2 days with the previous model. Perhaps due to its simplicity, the 
performance of the current model was less satisfactory when applied to predict responses of FM-sensitive 
cells with complex STRF (e.g., supplementary Fig. 1). For some cells, when more neurons were added to 
the first layer of the FIRNN, prediction markedly improved in performance, including responses that 
resembled post-inhibitory rebounds (see supplementary Fig. 4). This advantage with additional neurons in 
  
Fig. 4: Model performance (percentage of overlap in PSTH responsive area) for the 10 cells plotted as the 
results of systemically scanning the length of time window and the delay time. Arrows indicate the time 
window and delay determined based on trigger features in the STRF. Note the areas of peak performance 
 network was trained to use the instantaneous frequency time-profile of a training dataset to estimate the 
empirical responses in the PSTH (Fig. 7). A multi-scale Gaussian function (mean=0, variance=5) was again 
convolved with the model output to simulate synaptic activation of the cell and to improve predictive power 
(Englitz et al., 2010). In greater details, a ‘finite impulse response neural network’ (FIRNN; Back et al, 
1994) which models synaptic interactions as FIR linear filters was constructed in the form of an 
autoregressive time series (Fig. 7A,F; see supplementary text). After training (500 iteration with tone-2 
dataset), the FIRNN model acquired an optimized weighting function and at a given delay time (Fig. 7C). 
The performance of the model to predict PSTH responses of a testing dataset (tone-3) was assessed with a 
single iteration. As shown in Figure 7, the modulating time waveform (Fig. 7B) which represents the tone 
frequency of the FM stimulus is fed to the neuron in the input layer. The receiving neuron in the hidden 
layer convolves its trained weighting function with the input instantaneous frequency profile (Fig. 7C). The 
frequency profile signal is normalized between + and – 1.0, to represent the frequency range above and 
below the BF of the cell. The convolution process produces an output, which is further biased (to cater for 
silent periods in the PSTH), and transformed with a sigmoidal function (optimized to simulate the 
non-linear response-level function of the cell). Before final output, the predicted value is delayed at the 
output layer (to cater for the central transmission time). Hence, for each step of processing on the sliding 
window, a single point on the output PSTH is generated to represent the instantaneous strength of spike 
discharges (Fig. 7D, E).

Two indices were used to assess the performance of model prediction: (a) index-1 ‘percentage of 
overlap in PSTH’: we first compute the average percentage-disparity between the actual and predicted 
PSTHs (mean absolute difference in y-values of all time points), and then subtract the result from 100%, or 
(b) index-2 ‘percentage of overlap in the PSTH responsive area’: we compute the area of positive hit 
(‘intercept’) and divide it by the total area (‘union’) of actual and predicted responses. Index-1 is what the 
FIRNN was trained to fit (to respond to certain stimulus features and not to others), and index-2 is a stricter 
criterion as it considers only the areas of PSTH with spike responses and ignores those without. Since the 
FIRNN was trained to estimate the PSTH based on both positive and negative hits as a whole, index-1 
always gives a better performance. The alternative index based on correlating time points between 
predicted and actual PSTHs would yield performance levels intermediate between those generated by the 
present 2 indices.
