Research Goal: 
Performing entity clustering is one of the major research directions in social network 
analysis. Entity clustering aims at grouping nodes sharing some common characteristics 
into several clusters. In the context of social network mining, entity clustering can be 
divided into two categories. The first is to find communities or their structures [Newman 
2003]. A community is a subgraph containing tensely intra-connected edges within it and 
loosely inter-connected edges across communities. The second is to determine the 
network positions (or social roles) [Wasserman and Faust 1994] of entities playing 
similar roles or having close semantics in the network. This research focuses network 
clustering in heterogeneous social networks. That says, considering the hidden semantics 
inside a heterogeneous social network, we intend to group those nodes with similar 
behaviors or activities into the respective cluster. Therefore, this major goals and 
contributions can be summarized in the following two points. 
1. A method to capture the semantics of nodes. We suggest integrating the high-order 
relational information with the graph topology to model the semantics of nodes. We 
thus propose a feature-based formulation with a statistic sampling technique to capture 
the neighborhood information of a node in an unsupervised manner. By doing this, we 
can then transform a heterogeneous social network into a propositional format and 
facilitate mining tasks.  
2. Clustering nodes based on their roles. Instead of grouping nodes according to the 
principles of community (i.e., nodes densely connected should be put together), we 
propose a method to cluster nodes in a heterogeneous social network based on their 
social positions in the network. Nodes playing similar semantic roles are grouped and 
the system can further provide explanation for validation.

by optimizing a certain objective function with some relational constraints and the 
tolerant approximation, the relational clusters can be attained. Instead of partitioning the 
graph regarding patterns of interaction, we aim at grouping nodes based on their roles.  
Cai et al. [2005] address another kind of community detection problem in heterogeneous 
networks through learning an optimal linear combination of a user-queried relational 
structure. More recently, Sun et al. [2009] propose a NetClus algorithm to discover a new 
kind of clusters in a heterogeneous network, where each member in the cluster is a 
subgraph with star-shaped schema. However, their solution is restricted to this specific 
schema and therefore cannot deal with higher-order relational information.  
On the other hand, the social position analysis considers the neighbor structures of 
nodes to estimate the roles they play, which has similar goals as our social role-based 
clustering algorithm. Diverse social positions can be identified using various equivalence 
classes. There are three major kinds of equivalence class, including structural, 
automorphic, and regular equivalence [Wasserman and Faust 1994]. Two nodes are 
considered as structurally equivalent if both have identical links to and from other 
identical actors. The automorphic equivalence defines two actors as equivalent if they 
have the same local structure (i.e., pattern of graph isomorphism). The third and the least 
strict is the regular equivalence, which defines two actors as equivalent if both have 
similar links to members of other regular equivalence groups. 
The existing solutions to clustering nodes based on social roles, such as the 
blockmodeling approach [White et al. 1976] and profile similarity approach [Breiger 
1975], suffer from the common limitation of the lack of ability to handle multiple 
relational data, let alone considering higher order connections. That is, past methods 
simply exploit the statistics of the immediate nodes and links for equivalence detection. 
Besides, Scripps et al. [2007] identify different roles of nodes in a community, including 
ambassadors, big fish, loners, and bridges for homogeneous social networks. To the best 
of our knowledge, our solution to group nodes based on their semantic roles is the first to 
address this problem in the heterogeneous realm. It can be regarded as a generalized 
social role discovery model which simultaneously takes the diverse labeled relations and 
their higher-order combinations into consideration. Lin et al. [2007; 2008] propose a 
model to capture the semantics of nodes in a multi-relational network to identify nodes 
with abnormal behaviors. Our tensor based model can be regarded as a theoretically more 
sound, intuitive, and general model which can naturally adopt higher-order interactions as 
well as temporal information (by adding one more dimension in the tensor).

Table 2: Conditional probabilities of RE: P(L|X). 
 LCR1 LCR2 LCR3 LCR4 LCR5 LCR6 LCR7 
x1 0.02 0.08 0 0 0.1 0.3 0.5 
x2 0.3 0.03 0.4 0.25 0 0 0.02 
… … … … … … … … 
x100 0 0 0.01 0.07 0.9 0 0.02 
 
With the two random variables, we then define a conditional probability mass 
functions: P(L=l|X=x). We call it semantic profile for a certain node, which essentially 
stands for the probability that the LCR of a randomly selected path from x is l. After 
sampling RE for sufficient amount of times, it is possible to create a table (e.g. 
probability values in Table 2, assuming there are only 7 LCRs) which consist of the 
corresponding conditional probabilities. We call such tables the vector-based 
representation of nodes. That is, each row vector in the table is a representation of one 
node in the network. Note that the probability of each row sums to 1 in Table 2 sums to 1. 
Using the semantic profiles, nodes in a heterogeneous social network can be clustered 
based on the roles they play in the network. That is, we think the clustering could 
consider what kinds of interactions a node has with others and group nodes having 
similar interaction patterns with others would be grouped together, regardless of how far 
they are away from one another in the social network. 
Unlike the community detection methods which utilize structural information such as 
edge betweenness, geodesic distance, modularity, and etc., we propose creating a distance 
matrix among nodes using the semantic profiles which uniquely consider the higher-order 
relational information of edges. That is, the distance matrix is not determined by the 
distance between nodes in the social network, but the distance between their semantic 
profiles. Then we can apply various distance-based clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, 
hierarchical clustering) to the distance matrix for different purposes. Note that another 
advantage of our role-based clustering method over the community-based clustering 
algorithm is that the node types can also be taken into account since it is possible to 
consider only the distance matrix containing the same type of nodes. Therefore, nodes of 
different types (e.g., movie and person) will not be grouped together.

Based on Figure 3, we can observe that the members in each role-cluster are scattered 
among different communities. It makes sense since actors in distinct groups could 
perform similar roles. We can further observe role “B” dominates a large portion of the 
network. Most of the LCRs of role-B actors represent common behaviors for movie 
actors (e.g., such an actor played in a movie which has a certain director). These actors of 
role-B are generally regarded as full-time actors and seldom play other roles such as 
director, producer, or writer in their career. On the other hand, we can see the behaviors 
of those actors with role “A” and “D” differ from “B” to some extent. One special 
signature for actors of role “A” is they once played in some movie which was remade 
into other movies later. (e.g., Carrie Fisher and others performed in the movie “When 
Harry Met Sally”, which was later remade into another movie “If Lucy Fell”). The actors 
of role “D” all cooperated with certain visual directors in a movie. The actors in role “C” 
(e.g., Randy Quaid) have some sibling(s) who also work in the movie industry (note that 
only movie-related persons are listed in this dataset).  Role “E” includes people who 
married to another movie person, such as Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan as well as Tom 
Hanks and Rita Wilson. Finally, classes “F”, “G”, and “H” represent people who play 
multiple roles such as actor-and-writer, actor-and-director, or actor-and-producer in this 
network. Based on k-means clustering, there happens to be only single instance satisfying 
certain criteria in this network. Therefore, they become single-element clusters (or 
outliers). Note that it is also possible to apply different kinds of clustering algorithms 
such as hierarchical clustering methods to generate different kinds of clustering results.

Travel Report 
Prof. Shou‐de Lin, CSIE/GINM, NTU 
Attended  conference:  ACM  SIGKDD  Knowledge  Discovery  and  Data  Mining 
Conference 2008 
Conference duration: Aug24 to Aug 27, 2008 
Location: Las Vegas, NV, USA 
 
I have attended this year’s ACM SIGKDD conference because we were participated in 
this  year’s  KDDCUP  competition  and  has  been  selected  as  the winner.  The  award 
ceremony was held on 7/24/2008 (see attached pictures). 
This  year’s  KDDCUP  aims  at  solving  Breast cancer identification problem. Breast 
cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast. 
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women today (after lung 
cancer) and is the most common cancer among women, except for skin cancers. The 
KDDCUP challenge can be described as below: 
1. The rate of prevalence of malignant patients in a screening environment is extremely low 
(on average only around 5-10 patients out of 1000 screening patients have breast cancer). 
Therefore, in the first challenge, the participating entries will be judged in terms of the area 
under the FROC curve in the clinically relevant region 0.2-0.3 False positives per image. To 
support this, the participants have to return a file with a confidence score for every candidate 
of the test set (from –infinity to + infinity) that indicates the confidence of their classifier that 
the candidate is malignant. A score of +infinity corresponds to absolute confidence that the 
candidate is malignant, and a score of –infinity indicates absolute confidence that the 
candidate is benign.  
2. In the second challenge, our aim is to reduce the workload for radiologists, by asking 
them to only read a subset of cases that the algorithm deems at least somewhat unclear or
