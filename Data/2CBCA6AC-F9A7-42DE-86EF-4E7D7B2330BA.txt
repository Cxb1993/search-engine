ABSTRACT-This work studies the moving pattern and collision attrition of magnetic 
Ni particles in pure water in a flask on top of an actuator that contains a rotating bar 
magnet.  A Gauss meter, a digital camera, a particle size analyzer and a transmission 
electron microscope were adopted to record the magnetic field, the moving patterns, 
the particle size distributions and the micrographs of magnetic Ni powders, 
respectively.  The effects of the placement of a bar magnet with the interface 
between the positive and negative poles in a bar magnet at an angle of inclination β , 
the amount of the starting material and the duration of attrition on the moving pattern 
and the shrinking of the Ni particles were elucidated.  The distribution of magnetic 
lines of force was predicted and visualized.  The attrition of the Ni particles is 
determined from the number of collisions among Ni particles.  More initial Ni 
particles correspond to faster particle shrinkage, and more ultra-fine Ni powder.  
Although, the magnetic field is strongest at o0=β , the attrition was maximal at 
o30=β . 
 
Keywords: Collision attrition, moving pattern, magnetic particle, rotational magnetic 
field, magnetic lines of force.

Table 2 presents the conditions used in 36 tests.  Pure water was applied to prevent 
the ultra-fine Ni powder from dispersing into the atmosphere. 
A digital camera (BASLER A602fc-2)with )( 490)( 656 VH × pixels and a speed 
of 100 fps was used to take the photographs of moving Ni particles in the pure water 
in the flask, which was on the top of the actuator that contained a rotating bar magnet.  
The images help to clarify the attrition of the Ni particles.  The particle size 
distributions of the Ni powder were characterized using a Particle Size Analyzer 
(HOREBA LB 550) with a measuring range of 1~6000 nm.  Micrographs of the Ni 
powder were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL TEM-2010) 
with a magnification range of 2,000~1,500,000× .   
     A Gauss meter (KANETEC TM-601) with a measuring range of 0~15,000 G, 
and a transverse probe, on which a Hall effect sensor was placed, was utilized to 
measure the magnitude of the magnetic field of the bar magnet in the actuator.   
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1  Distribution of Particle Sizes 
     In the experiment on attrition, Ni particulates sieved through a mesh of size 
between 1 and 3 mm, were the starting material.  Figure 2 plots the particle size 
distributions in Tests 25~36 (grinding time: 3 hr.), and consists of three panels.  (1) 
The top panel refers to 50:2; (2) the central panel refers to 50:3, and (3) the bottom 
panel refers to 50:4.  Each panel of Fig. 2 plots four curves that refer to 
,75 and 60 ,30 ,0 oooo=β  respectively. 
     Figure 3 presents images of moving Ni particles in a flask filled with pure water 
driven by a rotating bar magnet in Tests 25, 26, 27, and 28 (with a water-to-particulate 
mass ratio of 50:2).  The photographs were taken 1 s after the start of the experiment.  
Figure 3 has four panels: (a) the left-top panel refers to o0=β  (Fig. 3(a)); (b) the 
right-top panel refers to o30=β  (Fig. 3(b)); (c) the left-bottom panel refers to 
o60=β  (Fig. 3(c)), and (d) the right-bottom panel refers to o75=β  (Fig. 3(d)). 
     At oo 75 and 60=β , the size of most of the Ni powder exceeds 1000 nm (Fig. 
2), probably because a disk-like agglomeration of Ni particles sticks to the bottom of 
the flask (Fig. 3(c) & (d)), and the Ni particles will not collide vigorously with each 
other. 
    As the water-to-particulate mass ratio increases from 50:2 to 50:4, the particle 
size distribution for o0=β  shifts toward the left, and the percentage of ultra-fine Ni 
powders ( nm 500≤ ) increases, probably because the number of vacancies between 
the columns of Ni particulate (Fig. 3(a)) decreases as water-to-particulate mass ratio 
increases.  Consequently, the frequency of collision among Ni particles increases, 
and the fraction of smaller particles increases. 
     At oo 30 and 0=β , the Particle Size Analyzer normally detects two major 
forms of Ni powder (Fig. 2).  The attrition of Ni particles is determined by the 
number of collisions among Ni particles, driven by the rotating magnetic field.  
Therefore, the rotating Ni particles cause the pure water to rotate in the flask, in turn 
causing the fine Ni powder to float and become suspended throughout the water, 
increasing not only the possibility of the attrition due to the collisions among the fine 
Ni powder particulates, but also the possibility of agglomeration.   
3.2  Attrition 
     Figure 4 plots the variations in the rate of ultra-fine Ni powder (powder 
size nm 500≤ ) in each test with angle of inclination β , and consists of three panels:
