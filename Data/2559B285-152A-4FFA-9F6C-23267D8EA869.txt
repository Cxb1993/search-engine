Abstract 
      In this study, two analytical models 
of rotating compression forming double-layers 
clad cylinder based on upper bound method 
and an analytical model based on the slab 
method as well as FEM simulation are 
proposed.  Model I is an analytical model of 
the compression forming of double-layers clad 
cylinder without the rotation, and Model II is 
that with the rotation. Velocity field and 
deformation behavior of rotating forming of 
double-layers clad cylinder are explored 
effectively, and effects of diameter height ratio, 
frictional factor and rotating angular speed on 
compression characteristics are discussed 
systematically.   Model III is an analytical 
model based on the slab method, and Model 
IV is the FEM simulation by SUPERFORM 
commercial software.  With a view to 
verifying the feasibility of these models, the 
experiment has been performed. The rotating 
compression forming of double-layers clad 
cylinder is a new forming technology, it can 
be offered to industry for technology 
establishment of rotating compression forming 
of double-layers clad cylinder.

1. Introduction 
Some problems were still happened in the 
compression forming process of cylinder or 
ring billet, such as non-uniform deformation 
and crack at the interior and exterior materials, 
bulging deformation at the side surface, the 
compression force and the power increase with 
increasing the frictional effect on the interface 
between the die and the material.  C.H. Lee et 
al. [1] used the upper-bound method to 
establish an admissible velocity field to explore 
the flow stress and frictional factor in the ring 
and cylinder compression processes. The 
frictional factor can be predicted by the ring 
compression test.  Douglas et al. [2] used the 
ring compression test to predict the flow stress 
under consideration of various forging rates 
and temperatures. Sofuoglu et al. [3] used the 
ring compression test to measure the frictional 
coefficient and obtained the calibration curves 
of frictional coefficient, and utilized the 
ABAQUS software to get some results.  
However these foregoing papers did not 
consider the rotating effect of deformed 
material. Xue et al. [4] used the finite element 
method to investigate the plastic deformation 
of cylinder in the twist-compression forming. 
The compression force and bulging 
deformation were reduced in such a 
deformation process. Kim et al. [5] established 
3D admissible velocity field using the upper 
coincides with the surface of the lower die. 
Sliding occurs at the friction surfaces such 
that 
1 1 1f m kτ =  at      0z =     (1) 
2 2 2f m kτ =  at       z H=        (2) 
Here 1fτ  and 2fτ  are the friction stresses at 
the lower and upper die surfaces, respectively, 
and 1m const=  and 2m const= are the 
corresponding friction factors. Sticking is 
assumed at the bi-material interface. Therefore, 
the velocity vector is continuous across the 
surface 1z H= . Using the radial, ( )1ru  and 
( )2
ru , and axial, 
( )1
zu  and 
( )2
zu , velocity 
components in materials 1 and 2, respectively, 
this condition can be written in the form 
( ) ( )1 2

at 1z H=                           (3) 
  The other velocity boundary conditions are

2.1-2 Upper bound method 
Kinematically admissible velocity field  
Any kinematically admissible velocity field 
must satisfy the incompressibility equation 
and the velocity boundary conditions (3) 
through (6). To satisfy the condition (6), 
assume the radial velocity field in the form 
( ) ( ) ( )1 1ru v
V
ρ ς=  and 
( ) ( ) ( )2 2ru v
V
ρ ς=    (8) 
where ( ) ( )1v ς  and ( ) ( )2v ς  are arbitrary 
functions of ς . Using (8) the radial and 
circumferential strain rate components can be 
found as 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )1 1 1rr V vRθθξ ξ ς= =  and    
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )2 2 2rr V vRθθξ ξ ς= =       (9) 
Substituting (9) into the incompressibity 
equation 0rr zzθθξ ξ ξ+ + =  and taking into 
account that zz zu zξ = ∂ ∂  it is possible to 
find the axial velocity in the form 
 
( ) ( ) ( )1 1

2zu t v d

ς
χ χ= − ∫  and     
( ) ( ) ( )12 22 1zu t v d
V ς
χ χ= −∫     (10) 
where χ is an auxiliary variable. Obviously, 
(10) satisfies the boundary conditions (4) and 
(5).  
 
Singular velocity field 
In the case of the maximum friction law at 
0z =  and z H= , the actual radial velocity 
field follows the rule [10] 
( ) ( )1ru O ς=   as 0ς →     and     
( ) ( )2 1ru O ς= −   as   1ς →       (11) 
The friction law (1) becomes the maximum 
friction law if 1 1m =  and the friction law (2) 
if 2 2m = . Nevertheless, the representation 
(11) can be used even if 1 1m < , or 2 1m < , or 
1 1m <  and 2 1m <  without violating any 
necessary requirement of the upper bound 
theorem. Therefore, in the present paper the 
representation (11) will be adopted with any 
value of the friction factors. It follows from 
(11) that the shear strain rate rzξ  and, 
Substituting (13) and (19) into (17), with 
the use of (7), gives the dimensionless upper 
bound pressure p in the form

then, minimizing the right hand side of (20) 
with respect to ( )1B  and ( )2B  determines the 
dependence of p on the parameters of the 
process. 
 
2.1-3. Results and Discussions 
Minimization of the right hand side of (20) 
has been carried out numerically assuming 
that 1 1m =  and 2 1m = . The variation of the 
dimensionless upper bound limit load with 
process parameters is illustrated in Figs. 2 
through 5. In these figures, 0p  is the value of 
p at 1 0.1h = . The values of 0p  are shown in 
Table 1.  The dependence of the upper bound 
limit load on process parameters for upsetting 
of two-layer cylinders has been determined. It 
is interesting to mention that in some cases the 
load attains a minimum with respect to 1h  
(Fig. 2). It is also important to mention that 
the present solution is restricted to sticking 
conditions at the bi-material interface. To 
complete the investigation of the problem, it is 
necessary to introduce kinematically 
admissible velocity fields with sliding (maybe 
in the form of velocity discontinuity surface) 
at the bi-material interface. It is also necessary 
to introduce velocity fields with rigid material.

The upper bound theorem has the following

V f fM PVω + = Ω + Ω + Ω      (35) 
where P  and M  are the compression force and 
torque, respectively, acted on the cylinder.  
Because of the twist effect of double-layer 
cylinder, the shear frictional stress at the interface 
is not acting on the radial direction, its orientation

The specific compression forces of both 
models decrease with an increase of clad 
thickness ratio. As the clad thickness ratio 
increases, the fraction of soft layer is more. 
Fig.18 shows the variation of specific 
compression forces obtained from UBM and 
SM with clad thickness ratio for various 
angular velocities.  As the clad thickness 
ratio or angular velocity increase, the specific 
compression force is reduced widely. 
 
4. FEM Simulation 
An investigation into the compression 
forming of double-layer clad cylinder using 
the commercial code SUPERFORM is 
developed. The workpiece of double-layer 
clad cylinder compressed between the upper 
and lower dies is meshed by a hexagon 
elastic-plastic element. 
In the simulations, the double-layer clad 
cylinder with the dimensions = +1 2H H H  
= 21mm , H1 is 3mm for the initial height of 
stainless SUS304 and H2 is 18 mm for the 
initial height of carbon steel SA516-70 with  
diameter, iD = 21mm (.β=6/7)

In the above simulations, the double-layer 
clad cylinder with the 
dimensions = +1 2H H H  = 21mm , H1 is 
12mm for the initial height of stainless 
SUS304 and H2 is 9 mm for the initial height 
of carbon steel SA516-70 with  diameter, 
iD = 21mm (.β=3/7).  The different bulging 
shape can be obtained in comparison ofβ
=6/7. 
 
 
5. Experiment 
The rotating compression machine is 
demonstrated in Fig.26. The mechanism is 
provided by the gear chains, the rotating 
power is provided the motors, and the rotating 
angular velocity is adjusted by a frequency 
adaptor. The maximum angular velocity of 
lower die is rotating at 3 rad/sec and the 
maximum compression force is 30 tons.

forming machine 
 
The specimens are the double-layer clad 
cylinder with the dimensions 1 2H H H= + =  
21mm , H1 is 3mm for the initial height of 
stainless SUS304 and H2 is 18mm for the 
initial height of carbon steel SA516-70.  The 
diameters of specimens are divided as three 
groups of iD = 21mm , 15mm , 9mm ,  
respectively, as shown Fig.27.   
 
 
The schemes of rotating compression 
forming experiment of the double-layer clad 
cylinder are as follows: 
(1) The angular velocity with rotation is 
= 0.16 rad secω  and no rotation, = 0ω , 
respectively. 
(2) The compression forces of rotating 
compression forming of the double-layer 
clad cylinder are measured. 
(3) The geometries of the deformed 
double-layer clad cylinder are measured. 
(4) Variations of the compression force with 
reduction are explored.

6. Conclusions 
 This project proposed a series of analysis 
models based on the upper bound method, the 
slab method, and FEM simulation. Moreover, 
the experiments have been performed to prove 
the acceptance of these models.  
The main results are summarized as follows: 
1. The dimensionless compression forces 
between the upper bound method and the slab 
method have been compared effectively. The 
error is small and the trend is similar. 
2. The experiments have been performed to 
verify the results obtained by the UBM, SM, 
and FEM. The results are reasonable if the 
friction is estimated exactly. 
3. Lots of FEM simulations have been 
developed to realize the acceptance. The 
effective stress and strain can be obtained 
from the FEM simulation.
