Abstract 
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) adsorbed on solid surfaces have been widely applied 
to biological sensors. The main sensing mechanism of adsorption-induced surface stress has not 
been well addressed in the literature. In this study, we used the density functional theory 
calculations to study the charge transfer at the interface between gold surface and the 
alkanethiolate molecules and the relation between the adsorption and the induced surface stress. 
Our aim is to identity the physical mechanism for the induced surface stress. 
The electronic structures of the self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkanethiolate 
[CH3(CH2)nS, n=1 - 6] on Au(111) surface have been investigated using the state-of-the-art 
first-principles calculations. The adsorption energy, the tilt angle, and the partial charge of 
n-alkanethiolate were presented. The charge transfer at the metal-molecule interface was 
calculated by the Mulliken population analysis. It was found that a net charge transfer of 0.09e ~ 
0.15e from gold surface to n-alkanethiolate molecules. Most of the charge transfer is accumulated 
in the carbon atom which is nearest to the sulfur atom. Our results show that the charge transfer is 
independent of chain length of n-alkanethiolate.

To obtain a quantitative understanding of the alkanethiolate-induced surface stress on gold (111) 
surface, we have performed state-of-the-art first-principle calculations for this system. The 
specific system investigated concerns the adsorption of alkanethiolates on gold (111), the charge 
transfer between alkanethiolate and metal surface, and the adsorption-induced surface stress. Our 
density functional theory (DFT) calculations could provide a further basis for comparison with 
experimental data. 
 
2. Ab initio calculation  
All of our calculations are carried out using the CASTEP package (a first principles quantum 
mechanical code for performing electronic structure calculations) [7], which is based on the 
density functional theory (DFT). Exchange and correlation (XC) effects are treated with the 
Perdew Wang 91 (PW91) form of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The ultrasoft 
pesudopotentials including the scalar relativistic effects are adopted. The wave function is 
expanded in a plane wave basis with an energy cutoff of 400eV. The Brillouin zone is sampled at 
k-points (6×6×1) according to the Monkhorst–Pack scheme and the electronic and atomic 
relaxations are carried out using the BFGS algorithm. The convergence criterions for geometry 
optimizations are 0.01 eV/Å  for the maximum force, 5.0×10-6 eV/atom for the energy, and 
5.0×10-4 Å  for the maximum displacement. For each optimized structure, the Mulliken 
population analysis implemented in CASTEP was used to calculate the partial charge on the 
atoms based on projecting the Kohn–Sham eigenstates onto atomic orbital basis sets. 
To save the computational time, we use the model of the (√3×√3)R30° structure instead of the 
c(4×2) superlattice as shown in Fig. 1. The periodic supercell method was employed to describe 
the (√3×√3)R30° structure of alkanethiolate on Au(111) surface. The slabs consist of four 
layers of Au atoms and a vacuum thickness of 12 – 18 Å . Each gold layer has three Au atoms and 
12 Au atoms are used to represent the gold surface. The optimized structures of alkanethiolate 
molecule with different chain lengths were placed in the vacuum region. The sulfur atom was 
positioned above the fcc-hollow site and the S-C bond point toward the bridge site. All the atoms 
in the unit cell were relaxed except the Au atom in the bottom layer during geometry optimization 
calculations. To validate the result of our DFT calculation, we calculate the equilibrium lattice 
constant, a0, bulk modulus, B, surface energy, γ, and cohesive energy, Ecoh, of bulk and surface 
gold and obtain the following values: 4.1559 Å , 150.32 GPa, 0.77 J/m2, and 3.19 eV, respectively. 
These are in good agreement with experiments. To make sure there is no residual force in the slab, 
the equilibrium lattice constant was used in the calculations.

3. Result and Discussion 
A. Adsorption of alkanethiolate 
In order to get the structure of alkanethiolate adsorbed on Au (111) surface at high coverage, 
geometry optimizations were performed. Figs. 1(b) and 1(c) show the optimized structures of 
methanethiolate and ethanethiolate adsorbed on (√3×√3) R30° Au (111) surface. All the 
adsorption sites of alkanethiolate molecules are in middle of the fcc and the bridge sites.  Table I 
shows the adsorption energy , Ead (kcal/mol), the tilt angle between surface normal and S-C bond 
(deg), the distance between Sulfur atom and two adjacent gold atoms, dS-Au (Å ), and the bond 
order between sulfur and the adjacent Au atoms of alkanethiolate adsorbed on Au (111) surface at 
high coverage. 
The adsorption energy was calculated as 
Ead = - [E (thiolate/Au) – E (Au) – E (thiolate)]                   (1) 
where E(thiolate/Au) , E(Au), and  E(thiolate)  represent the total energies of the alkanethiolate 
molecules adsorbed on gold (111) surface, bare gold(111) surface, and the alkanethiolate 
molecules in the gas phase, respectively.  The adsorption energies of alkanethiolate molecules 
on Au (111) surface are less than those of alkanethiolate with Au-adatom moieties on Au(111) 
surface. It is seen that the adsorption energy on Au (111) surface is weakly dependent on the 
chain length. Table I also shows that the angle between S-C bond and the surface normal 
decreases as the chain length increases. 
B. Charge transfer and the chain length effect 
To further investigate the charge transfer, we performed the Mulliken population analysis 
implemented in CASTEP for each optimized structure. Table II lists the Mulliken charges (e) on 
all the involved atoms. It is found that the net excess Mulliken charges (e) resulting from the 
PW91 functional are －0.15, －0.14, －0.13, －0.11, －0.12, and －0.12 for methanethiolate, 
ethanethiolate, propanethiolate, butanethio-late, pentanethiolate, and hexanethiolate, respectively. 
This indicates a charge transfer from Au surface to alkanethiolate molecules. The charge transfer 
leads to negatively charged alkanethiolate molecules and form surface dipoles on gold surface. 
Most of the transferred charge is accumulated in the carbon atom next to the sulfur atom. The 
result yields the independence of chain length of alkanethiolate on the charge transfer.

4. Conclusions 
In summary, the first-principles calculations were performed to study the electronic structures of 
alkanethiolate on Au (111) surface with high coverage. It was found that a charge transfer of 
0.09e ~ 0.15e from gold surface to alkanethiolate molecules. Most of the transferred charge is 
accumulated in the carbon atom next to the sulfur atom. We also found that the induced surface 
stresses are anisotropic compressive stress from the DFT stress calculation.
