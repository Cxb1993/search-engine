1.1 前言 
Prosody refers to aspects of speech signal other than the actual words spoken, such as timing and 
fundamental frequency pattern, and plays an important role in the disambiguation of discourse structure. 
Without prosody, speech would be flat and toneless, and would sound tedious, unpleasant, or even 
barely intelligible. Therefore, prosodic modeling is quite important for TTS (text-to-speech), ASR 
(automatic speech recognition) and other applications in speech processing field. Additionally, as 
global communication and multiethnic societies grow, the demand for multilingual capability increases 
[1]-[14]. Code-switching (alternation between two or more languages) is a quite common phenomenon 
in many multilingual societies.  
1.2 研究目的 
In Taiwan, at least three languages – Mandarin, Taiwanese and English – are frequently mixed 
and spoken in daily conversations and writings. Polyglot TTS systems which can process 
mixed-language input and generate mixed speech with coherent prosody are highly demanded. A 
review of existing multilingual TTS systems shows that most multilingual TTS systems support the 
secondary language in a very limited way. The secondary language inserted into the primary language 
sounds more like isolated individual words in an alien language environment and not congruous with 
the primary language’s prosody. Therefore, we would like to analyze the prosody of mixed language 
and explore novel prosodic modeling approach to solve the problems we encountered in existing 
multilingual TTS. 
1.3 文獻探討 
Many methods have been proposed to solve the multilingual problem. For example, [1] performs 
text normalization, text processing separately for Cantonese and English, but treated them together in 
prosody prediction, which ensures a coherent intonation in mixed language situation. [2]-[3] rely on a 
Phoneme Mapping algorithm to make foreign phoneme sequences pronounceable. [4] uses an 
RNN-MLP-based scheme to generate proper prosodic information for spelling English words 
embedded in Chinese text background. It first treats each English word as a Chinese word and uses the 
RNN to generate eight prosodic parameters for each alphabet of the word. It then uses these four MLPs 
to refine these prosodic parameters. 
state and high-level linguistic cues. Through this two-stage modeling approach, some unsolved 
problems can be avoided. Problems such as the inconsistency of prosodic and syntactic structures, the 
ambiguity of word-segmentation and word-chunking, and the difficulty of performing automatic 
syntactic analysis on unlimited natural texts can be prevented in the first subtask. In the second subtask, 
the researcher can focus on modeling the global effect of mapping high-level linguistic features to the 
prosodic state, since interference caused by low-level linguistic features has already been removed in 
the first subtask. In this paper, we attack the first subtask only, leaving the second subtask to be dealt 
with in the future. 
 Due to the fact that the prosodic state of a syllable is not explicitly given, it has been treated as 
a hidden variable and expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms has been applied to estimate all the 
parameters based on training data. A by-product of the EM algorithm is the determination of the hidden 
prosodic states of all the syllables in the training set. This is an additional advantage because prosodic 
labeling has recently become an interesting research topic [21]. From the sequence of prosodic states, 
some high-level linguistic phenomenon could be observed, like the possible prosodic phrase 
boundaries. 
Mandarin Chinese is a tonal and syllable-based language. Syllable is the basic pronunciation unit. 
Each character is pronounced as a syllable. There exist only about 1300 phonetically distinguishable 
syllables comprising the set of all legal combinations of 411 base-syllables and five tones.  Tonality of 
a syllable is characterized by its pitch contour shape, loudness and duration. This means the tone of a 
syllable will affect its duration. We therefore consider tone as an affecting factor. One obvious 
phenomenon to show the affection of tone on syllable duration is that syllables with Tone 5 are always 
pronounced much shorter. Besides, Tone 3 can be pronounced in three basic patterns of falling-rising 
(full tone), low-falling (half tone), and middle-rising (sandhi tone) which are of different durations. For 
simplifying the problem, except the 7 tones of Chinese, one tone is left for English alphabets, though 
English is not tone language. 
By considering the affecting factors, the additive duration model can be expressed by

where  and  are, respectively, the observed duration and the normalized duration of the nth

prosodic state, and base-syllable/alphabet of the nth modeling unit; and  is modeled as a normal 
distribution mean

To estimate the parameters of the model, the widely-used approach based on the maximum 
likelihood (ML) criterion can be adopted. But the closed-form solution of the ML estimation is difficult 
to obtain. We therefore solve the problem using the EM algorithm. The EM algorithm is derived based 
on incomplete training data with prosodic state being treated as hidden or unknown. In the following, 
we discuss it in more detail.

1.5 結果與討論 
An English-Mandarin bilingual speech database was used in the experiment. All the English 
words are in spelling style, that is, are read alphabet by alphabet, like “WTO”, “DDT” and “CPU”. The 
database consists of 539 sentential utterances. All utterances were generated by a female speaker, who 
is a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese. They were all spoken naturally at an average speed of 3.5 
syllables/s. There are, in total, 13540 characters including 1872 English alphabets and 11668 Chinese 
characters. The longest English word contains 6 alphabets. The shortest contains 1 alphabet. The 
average length of English word is 2.996 alphabets/word. The database was divided into two parts: a 
training set and an open test set. Training set contains 8607 Chinese syllables and 1413 English 
alphabets. Test set contains 3061 Chinese syllables and 459 English alphabets. All speech signals were 
digitally recorded at a 20-kHz sampling rate. They were manually segmented into Chinese syllable and 
English alphabet sequences. 
First, initial values of all parameters were independently estimated from the training set. 
Prosodic states were labeled by a vector quantizer with 8 codewords. Then, the EM algorithm was 
performed to update all parameters until convergence. As shown in Table 1, the variances of the 
observed duration were 166.68 and 143.16 frame2 for the training and testing data sets. One frame 
equals 5 ms. The resulting variances of the normalized duration reduced to 11.18 and 3.51 frame2 for 
the closed and open tests. The variances were greatly reduced after compensating the effects of the 
affecting factors. The corresponding root mean squared errors between the original and estimated 
durations were 1.79 and 1.87 frame for the closed and open tests. 
Tables 2 and 3 show the companding values of the two affecting factors for lexical tone and 
prosodic state, respectively. For simplifying the problem, except the 7 tones of Chinese, one tone is left 
for English alphabets, though English is not tone language. Can be seen from Table 2 that Tone 5 has 
relatively smaller companding value so as to make the associated syllable duration much shorter than 
those of the other tones. This agrees to the prior linguistic knowledge. Besides, when it’s English 
alphabets, the companding value 4.35 is the largest. It may be because it’s an alien language for the 
speaker, and the speaker will automatically slow down when pronouncing English alphabets. Besides, 
many English alphabets are not monosyllable. 
Table 3 shows the CFs of 8 prosodic states. It can be found from Table 3 that State 7 has the 
largest CF while State 0 has the smallest. Fig. 1 shows an example of prosodic state labeling by the EM 
training algorithm. From Fig. 1, we find that states with larger index, that is, with larger companding 
value, usually associates with the ending syllables of sentences or phrases and states with smaller index,
