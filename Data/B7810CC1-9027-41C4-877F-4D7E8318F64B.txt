Abstract--In this project, a LED backlight driving system for large scale of LCD panels is proposed. 
High efficiency, high power factor, circuit simplicity, and low cost can be achieved by using a 
single-stage charge-pump asymmetrical-half-bridge converter. To regulate the LED current and 
brightness for the lattice structure of LED backlight system, a dimming control method is presented. 
The requirements for the current sharing and luminance balance between paralleled LED arrays can 
be satisfied while current ripple is eliminated significantly. Due to the addition of a bypass diode, an 
alternative current path is offered during a single-LED failure. Reliability of the LED backlight 
system can be thus improved effectively. A laboratory prototype has been built and tested. The 
simulation and experimental results are shown to verify the feasibility of the proposed method.

I、簡介 
目前液晶顯示面板無論在可視角、對比亮度、製程良率與液晶反應時間上已有長足的進
步，再加上各大製造商積極的投入第六、七代廠的興建，使得液晶顯示面板成為顯示器市場
上最具潛力的新興產品，於 2004 年電腦顯示器市場已達到百分之八十以上的市場佔有率，
未來將取代傳統陰極射線管(Cathode Ray Tube, CRT)成為所有顯示器的主流。液晶顯示面板

而基本上 LED 背光模組同樣可依光源入射位置分為直下式與邊光端緣式兩大類。直下
式背光模組將 LED 排列於液晶面板背面正下方；邊光式背光模組於液晶面板背面設置導光
板，導光板端面的 LED 光線入射至導光板內，均勻擴散後再從導光板表面射出[3]，而本計
畫採用直下式背光模組，可獲得最亮的光源。 
III、充電幫浦功率因數修正電路 
一般的功率因數修正電路大多為升壓電路，如圖二為一個 AC/DC 轉換器的示意圖。通常
設計直流匯流排電壓 BV 的電壓值高於輸入電壓，由圖可知， XV 的電壓為輸入電壓和直流匯流
排電壓
BV 的電壓差，為了實現功率因數修正，整流後的線電流 Xi 的波形與線電壓同相位，其
波形圖如圖三所示。為了達到功率因數修正，當負載為輕載時，
XV 在接近線電壓的零交越點
為最大值；當負載為重載時，
XV 為最小值。何種形式的拓樸電路可以達到此特性呢?具有諧振
電路的轉換器將可以達到此特性，如圖四為一個基本的充電幫浦修正功率因數半橋轉換器，
接下來將針對改善功率因數的條件對此轉換器做分析[4-7]。 
圖五。因為充電電容 inC 和高頻電壓源串聯並且的從輸入電壓吸取能量，對輸入電容C 放電此
電路特性可看為幫浦的功能，因此將此種轉換器稱做為充電幫浦功因修正器(Voltage Source 
Charge Pump Power Factor Corrector VS-CPPFC )。

因為 LED 背光源為串並聯迴路，如圖六所示。本計畫針對 12 吋製作其 LED 背光源，依

LED 背光源為串並聯陣列，其中在串聯迴路部分，當單顆 LED 損壞時會導致整串迴路不
導通，使得發光的均勻性有所影響，故提出旁路二極體的設計，利用稽納二極體並聯在每顆
LED 旁，設計其稽納的崩潰電壓高於 LED 之導通電壓，當 LED 正常工作時，稽納二極體電
壓未崩潰導通；當 LED 損壞斷路時，則稽納二極體導通，提供額外之電流路徑，使得串聯迴
路得以繼續導通，其他 LED 可繼續發亮，此方法將可有效改善 LED 背光系統的可靠度。

圖十 電路圖模式分析 
模式一：( 0 1t t t  ) 
切換區間從此區間開始如圖十(a)所示，此區間開關 1S 導通 2S 截止；此時二極體 xD 導通，
輸入電壓對電容 inC 充電，而 rL 轉態為放電狀態，電容 pC 亦相同於 rL 為放電狀態，儲能電容C
將能量經由開關 1S 傳至變壓器，而次級側 1oD 導通對 oL 、 oC 充電並提供給負載能量。由工作狀
態圖可知， xD 為導通狀態，電容 inC 為充電狀態當時間為 1t 時， inC 電壓被充至端電壓 inv ，此
時 xD 截止。而 Lri 則逐漸放電； pC 也逐漸放電當時間為 1t 時 aV 電壓降至零。 
 
模式二：( 1 2t t t  ) 
切換區間模式如圖十(b)所示，此區間開關 1S 導通 2S 截止；由於當時間為 1t 時 aV 電壓降至
零，此時 2rD 導通而 rL 繼續上個模式為放電狀態，儲能電容C 繼續將能量傳至變壓器；而次級
側狀態不變 1oD 導通提供能量給負載端。由工作狀態圖可知， Lri 則繼續放電當時間為 2t 時放電
Lri 繼續釋能，當時間為 9t 時 Lri 為零而 1rD 自然截止，電壓 aV 箝制在 BV 。 
 
模式七：( 9 10t t t  ) 
    此切換區間模式如圖十(j)所示，此區間開關 1S 為截止、 2S 為導通；在上個模式停止時 1rD
截止，則此時 pC 和 rL 諧振， pC 將能量傳遞給 rL ，但時間極短因為諧振頻率 1 非常的高。而此
時隔離電容 bC 經由初級側對 rbL 充能，並將能量傳遞至二次側，二次側 2oD 導通對輸出電感負
載端提供能量。從工作狀態圖可知， Lri 換向呈現充能情況，而 aV 電壓因為 pC 釋能當時間為 10t
時降低至 inV 電壓。而 pC 和 rL 諧振的電壓電流可表示為： 
 
模式八：( 10 11t t t  ) 
此切換區間模式圖如圖十(k)所示，此區間開關 1S 為截止、 2S 為導通；此時二極體 xD 導通，
輸入電流開始對 inC 和 rL 充電，而 inC 和 rL 形成串聯諧振。此時隔離電容 bC 繼續對 rbL 充能，並
將能量傳遞至二次側，二次側 2oD 導通對輸出電感負載端提供能量。從工作狀態波形圖可知，
Lri 繼續為充能情況，而 inC 開始充電 cV 開始上升， aV 電壓則逐漸降低。

ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we study a two-phase quasi-resonant Flyback converter. A simple master-slave control 
method is realized to achieve well current sharing between two phase modules. The resonant behavior 
between the transformer magnetizing inductor and switch parasitic capacitor is utilized to implement a 
valley control. Soft-switching on power switches can be achieved to raise the conversion efficiency 
significantly. Experimental results of a laboratory prototype are shown to verify the feasibility. 
 
Keywords: Master-Slave, Quasi-Resonant, Soft Switching, Current Sharing 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Widely uses of 3C (computer, communication and consumer) products make the rapid advances of power 
conversion technologies. A Flyback isolated DC/DC converter is popular for low-power applications due to 
its simple circuit configuration and less component counts. High current stresses and high voltage spike on 
the power switch make it unsuitable for medium- and high-power applications [1-3]. An interleaved 
Flyback converter has the merits of simplicity and low current stresses for medium-power applications. 
However, high voltage spike and hard-switching characteristic deteriorates its conversion efficiency. 
Recently, a quasi-resonant (QR) Flyback technique with valley control is commonly used to raise the 
efficiency performance for low-power applications. Soft-switching features significantly reduce the 
switching losses on power switch [4-9]. In this letter, we study a master-slave QR Flyback converter with 
well current sharing. Only simple commercial control ICs are used to realize the studied master-slave 
operation. No complicated control circuit is needed for the implementation of soft-switching and 
interleaved operations. The studied converter has the advantages of high conversion efficiency, low device 
stress, low output ripple, simple control and well current sharing features. The operation principle and 
design consideration of the studied converter will be analyzed and discussed in the following sections. 
2. OPERATION PRINCIPLE AND STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS 
Figure 1 shows the studied two-phase QR Flyback converter. The power converter is composed of two 
quasi-resonant Flyback circuits. Two simple commercial control ICs are used to realize the studied master-slave 
operation for output voltage ripple reduction. The gating signal of the master controller is sent to the slave controller for 
realizing interleaved operation of two QR Flyback circuits. The error amplifier built in control ICs can be used for 
adjusting the corresponding phase current to achieve current sharing. The resonant behaviors between the transformer 
magnetizing inductances and switch parasitic capacitances are utilized to implement a valley control. Soft-switching on 
power switches can be achieved and the conversion efficiency can be then significantly improved. Figure 2 shows the 
theoretical waveforms of the studied master-slave two-phase Flyback converter. There are five operation 
modes during a switching period. Referring to the equivalent circuits in Figure 3, the operation principle of 
the studied converter can be explained in detail.

Figure 6 shows the measured waveforms for the gate-source voltage and switch current of the prototype 
converter. The experimental results agree with the theoretical waveforms shown in Figure 2. It is obvious 
that current sharing between the master and slave modules can be achieved. Figure 7 shows the measured 
waveforms for the drain-source voltage on the power switches. It can be observed that low device stresses 
can be achieved.

Figure 7 Measured Waveforms for the Drain-Source Voltage. 
Figure 8 shows the measured efficiencies of the single-phase QR Flyback converter under different input 
voltages and turns ratios. As mentioned above, high transformer turns ratio reduces the switching loss and 
raise the conversion efficiency but increases the MOSFET voltage stress. Figure 9 shows the measured 
efficiencies of the studied two-phase QR Flyback converter with turns ratio n=50/15. Compared with the

1. INTRODUCTION 
The photovoltaic (PV) street lighting systems have been used in many developing countries. They are 
highly economical when used in newly-built urban road sections and remote rural areas without an 
electricity network. During daytime, the battery is charged by a PV panel. At night, the solar energy stored 
in the battery is released to power the street lights. High-intensity-discharge (HID) lamps are commonly 
used as street light sources because of their high luminous efficacy, good color rendition, and long lifetime 
[1, 2]. The HID lamp needs an auxiliary circuit called a “ballast” to ensure stable lamp operation because of 
its negative impedance characteristics. Figure 1 shows the conventional PV HID street lighting system. A 
boost maximum power point tracking (MPPT) PV charger is usually applied to extract maximum power 
from the PV panel in all solar irradiation conditions [3]. A PV inverter circuit releases the solar energy in 
the battery to the AC-line utility. A boost power factor correction (PFC) circuit is series-connected with the 
electronic ballast to achieve high power factor input and drive the HID lamp. The conventional PV HID 
street lighting system has the drawbacks of high circuit complexity and low system efficiency due to a four-
stage power conversion.

Figure 2 shows the proposed PV HID street lighting system. A single-ended primary inductance converter 
(SEPIC) is used for MPPT and battery charging under a wide range of PV panel voltage variations. A new 
battery charging scheme is proposed to estimate the state of charge (SOC) and prolong battery lifetime. The

Figure 5 shows the circuit diagram of the studied electronic ballast for powering HID street-light lamps. 
The electronic ballast consists of a front-end Flyback DC/DC converter and a low-frequency square-wave 
DC/AC inverter. The front-end DC/DC converter releases the solar power stored in the battery and feeds a 
high-voltage DC bus for the post-stage DC/AC inverter. Periodic HID lamp excitation at a high frequency 
range can then lead to acoustic resonance that would produces an unstable arc and even cracks the tube. In 
this work, the DC/AC inverter was operated at a low frequency to avoid acoustic resonance of the HID 
lamps. A voltage doubler, a spark gap (S. G.), and a pulse transformer T2 were added to the power circuit. 
Prior to the ignition, the HID lamp can be considered an open circuit. The voltage doubler boosts the output 
voltage of the DC/AC inverter to reach the breakdown voltage of the spark gap. When the spark gap turns 
on, the pulse transformer induces a required high voltage (about 20kV) at its secondary winding to ignite 
the HID lamp.

4. SEPIC PFC CONVERTER 
The proposed PV HID street lighting system is connected to the AC-line utility with a SEPIC power factor 
correction (PFC) converter shown in Figure 6. When the battery voltage drops to a given value, the Flyback 
DC/DC converter is shut down to prevent the battery from over-discharging. The SEPIC PFC circuit draws 
energy from the AC-line utility to drive the HID lamp via the low-frequency square-wave DC/AC inverter: 
thus, the HID street lighting system will not be extinguished even if the battery is fully discharged. With a 
coupled inductor, high input power factor can be achieved at the AC-line utility side using a simple 
transition-mode (TM) PFC control.

5. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 
The aim of this paper is to study a high performance PV HID street lighting system. The design 
considerations for the MPPT PV charger and the electronic ballast circuit are described and discussed 
below. 
A. MPPT PV Charger Design 
For the PV HID street lighting system proposed in this paper, MPPT was used to increase the efficiency of 
battery charging. A Perturb and Observe (P&O) method characterized by important advantages such as 
simplicity and good performance, was hereby adopted [6, 7]. The maximum power of the PV panel can be 
extracted both in the continuous MPPT charging stage and the charging period of the pulse MPPT charging 
stage. Figure 7(a) shows the detailed charging current waveform. During the pulse-charging stage, an 
average charging current with an exponential profile is recommended by the battery manufacturer’s manual 
to maintain a constant battery voltage level, Vb,set . The equation of the average charging current Ib(t) can be 
expressed as:

B. Electronic Ballast Design 
In this work, a prototype circuit was designed to drive a 35W HID lamp OSRAM D2S. Figure 10 shows the 
control flow chart of the HID electronic ballast. In the beginning, the Flyback converter was operated at 
constant voltage (CV) mode to produce a 350V output voltage for igniting the HID lamp via the DC/AC 
inverter and the high voltage ignition circuit. After ignition, the Flyback converter was operated at constant 
current (CC) mode to provide a warm-up current of 2.5A. Once the lamp voltage reached to 30V, the 
circuit was operated at constant power (CP) mode to maintain a 75W warn-up power. During the run-up 
stage, lamp power gradually decreased from 75W to 35W. At the steady state, the electronic ballast was 
operated at CP mode to supply a 35W rated power to the HID lamp.

C. SEPIC PFC Converter Design 
As the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6, the voltages across two windings of the coupled inductor Lc are 
both the rectified AC-line voltage |Vac| during the on-time of power switch QPFC and the DC output voltage 
Vdc during the off-time of power switch QPFC. The equivalent inductances Le1 and Le2 for the coupled 
inductor can be expressed as follows: 
mc2

mc1
c2mc2c1c1m
2
e2 1)L-(n-L
LLLLLLn
L
 , (8) 
Neglecting the leakage inductance Lc2, because the same voltage is applied to both sides of the coupled 
inductor, the following relationship equation can be given: 
 
(a)                                                   (b)                                                    (c)

Figure 15 demonstrates the measured ignition waveforms. Here, a 20kV voltage was supplied to ignite the 
HID lamp. The measured lamp voltage and lamp current under start-up process and steady-state operation 
are shown in Figures 16(a) and 16(b). For the studied PV HID street lighting system, the Flyback DC/DC 
converter is shut down to prevent the battery from over-discharging when the battery voltage drops to a 
given value. The SEPIC PFC circuit draws energy from the AC-line utility to drive the HID lamp via the 
low-frequency square-wave DC/AC inverter.

Figure 17 shows the measured transient waveforms during the transition between PV and PFC modes. It 
can be observed that the SEPIC PFC circuit draws energy from the AC-line utility when the battery is taken 
off at the input side of electronic ballast. Figure 18(a) shows the measured inductor current waveforms for 
the studied SEPIC PFC circuit. A CCM input current is obtained while the summation current of the 
inductor currents ILc1 and ILc2 is operated under transition mode. The large input filter in a conventional TM 
PFC circuit is not needed for the studied PFC circuit using a TM PFC control IC LT6561. The measured 
input voltage and current waveforms are shown in Figure 18(b). High input power factor can be achieved at 
the AC-line utility side.

ABSTRACT 
In this paper, we study a two-phase quasi-resonant Flyback converter. A simple master-slave control 
method is realized to achieve well current sharing between two phase modules. The resonant behavior 
between the transformer magnetizing inductor and switch parasitic capacitor is utilized to implement a 
valley control. Soft-switching on power switches can be achieved to raise the conversion efficiency 
significantly. Experimental results of a laboratory prototype are shown to verify the feasibility.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Widely uses of 3C (computer, communication and consumer) products make the rapid advances of power 
conversion technologies. A Flyback isolated DC/DC converter is popular for low-power applications due to 
its simple circuit configuration and less component counts. High current stresses and high voltage spike on 
the power switch make it unsuitable for medium- and high-power applications [1-3]. An interleaved 
Flyback converter has the merits of simplicity and low current stresses for medium-power applications. 
However, high voltage spike and hard-switching characteristic deteriorates its conversion efficiency. 
Recently, a quasi-resonant (QR) Flyback technique with valley control is commonly used to raise the 
efficiency performance for low-power applications. Soft-switching features significantly reduce the 
switching losses on power switch [4-9]. In this letter, we study a master-slave QR Flyback converter with 
well current sharing. Only simple commercial control ICs are used to realize the studied master-slave 
operation. No complicated control circuit is needed for the implementation of soft-switching and 
interleaved operations. The studied converter has the advantages of high conversion efficiency, low device 
stress, low output ripple, simple control and well current sharing features. The operation principle and 
design consideration of the studied converter will be analyzed and discussed in the following sections. 
2. OPERATION PRINCIPLE AND STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS 
Figure 1 shows the studied two-phase QR Flyback converter. The power converter is composed of two 
quasi-resonant Flyback circuits. Two simple commercial control ICs are used to realize the studied master-slave 
operation for output voltage ripple reduction. The gating signal of the master controller is sent to the slave controller for 
realizing interleaved operation of two QR Flyback circuits. The error amplifier built in control ICs can be used for 
adjusting the corresponding phase current to achieve current sharing. The resonant behaviors between the transformer 
magnetizing inductances and switch parasitic capacitances are utilized to implement a valley control. Soft-switching on 
power switches can be achieved and the conversion efficiency can be then significantly improved. Figure 2 shows the 
theoretical waveforms of the studied master-slave two-phase Flyback converter. There are five operation 
modes during a switching period. Referring to the equivalent circuits in Figure 3, the operation principle of 
the studied converter can be explained in detail.

Figure 6 shows the measured waveforms for the gate-source voltage and switch current of the prototype 
converter. The experimental results agree with the theoretical waveforms shown in Figure 2. It is obvious 
that current sharing between the master and slave modules can be achieved. Figure 7 shows the measured 
waveforms for the drain-source voltage on the power switches. It can be observed that low device stresses 
can be achieved.

Figure 8 shows the measured efficiencies of the single-phase QR Flyback converter under different input

raise the conversion efficiency but increases the MOSFET voltage stress. Figure 9 shows the measured 
efficiencies of the studied two-phase QR Flyback converter with turns ratio n=50/15. Compared with the 
experimental results shown in Figure 8, it can be observed that the studied master-slave QR Flyback 
converter has better efficiency performance.

技術說明
(中文) 近年來LED的發展迅速，亮度逐漸提升，再加上高亮度LED大量生產後，LED被廣
泛的應用在包含小型面板與交通號誌等。而發光效率的提升，使得利用LED當作
LCD背光源得以實現。現今的LCD背光源多使用CCFL，但是由於CCFL含汞，會產生
環保的問題，歐盟已決定於2006年禁止使用CCFL背光源，而LED背光源的誕生替
代了CCFL的使用。另外因為綠色能源的提倡，各國都提出相關性的措施，各國將
許多發光源由LED取代，將可減少發電量與發電所需之能源消耗。LED耗電量低的
特性，完全符合綠色環保的需求，所以各家廠商積極開發LED背光面板，未來若
發光效率再提升，發展大型尺寸將是必然趨勢，成本上也會降低。所提出大尺寸
液晶電視面板之LED背光電路，採用單級充電幫浦非對稱半橋電能轉換器架構，
高效率、高功率因數、簡單電路和低成本要求將可達成。為了調整背光系統之
LED電流和亮度，數種調光技術將被實現和比較，以滿足LED陣列間均流與亮度平
衡特性。一種背光 LED之旁路設計也將被研究，於單顆LED損壞時提供額外路徑，
避免整排LED陣列熄滅，LED背光系統之可靠度得以有效提升。
(英文) A white-light LED backlight for LCD TV panels is presented. High efficiency, high 
power factor, circuit simplicity, and low cost can be achieved by using a single-stage 
charge-pump asymmetrical-half-bridge converter. To regulate the LED current and 
brightness for the LED backlight system, some dimming operation methods are 
implemented and compared for satisfying the requirements of current sharing and 
luminance balance among paralleled LED arrays. A bypass design for backlighting LEDs 
is presented to offer an alternative current path when a single LED fails. The LED array 
will not distinguish. Reliability of the LED backlight system can thus be improved 
effectively.
