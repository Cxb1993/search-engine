一、中文摘要 
在無線感測網路中，能量消耗的降低一
直是很重要的研究議題。為了降低無線感測網
路的能量消耗並延長其壽命，在 IEEE 802.15.4
標準中，採用超碼框結構來做資料的傳送。然
而該標準並沒有辦法根據整體網路的狀況，適
應性的調整超碼框。因此，當網路中之感測節
點數量增加或網路負載提高時，在有限的活動
區間內將導致裝置傳送機會減少以及碰撞機
率增加，進而造成能量消耗的增加及整體網路
效能降低。為了解決上述問題，本計畫提出適
應性超碼框調整機制 (adaptive superframe 
adjustment scheme; ASFAS)，本機制根據協調
者觀測到的網路特徵，適應性的調整超碼框，
以增加感測節點傳輸機會並提升整體網路效
能。從模擬的結果得知，本計畫所提出的機
制，對於有效產能、傳輸延遲及能量消耗均有

Abstract:  
Energy consumption is an important issue in 
wireless sensor networks. In order to increase 
the life time of wireless sensor network, 
superframe structure is used for data 
transmission in IEEE 802.15.4 standard. 
However, the duty cycle of the superframe 
structure cannot be dynamically adjusted 
according to the situation of entire network. 
Thus, when the number of devices and traffic 
load increase, the insufficient of active periods 
will decrease the transmission opportunities of 
devices and increase the collision probability. 
Thus, the above problems will cause the 
performance of entire network deteriorated. 
In order to solve the above mentioned 
problems, we proposed the adaptive superframe 
adjustment scheme (ASFAS), it can dynamically 
adjust the duty cycle of the superframe 
according to the certain features observed by the 
coordinator, like the occupied proportion of 
superframe and collision proportion of devices. 
ASFAS can increase transmission opportunities 
of devices and improve the performance of 
entire network. The simulation results of 
goodput, delay and power consumption shows 
the improvement of our scheme. 
Keywords: IEEE 802.15.4, superframe structure,

二、計畫緣由與目的 
無線感測網路[1]–[4]是由感測節點所構
成，由於感測節點是以電池為供電來源，故在
此種網路中，如何降低能量消耗並提升網路整
體效能，是一個非常重要的議題。相較於其他
的標準，IEEE 802.15.4標準[5]–[6]由於實現了
低功率消耗的目標，故成為無線感測網路的主
流標準。為了降低感測節點的工作週期，IEEE 
802.15.4標準可以選擇性的使用超碼框架構
(superframe structure) ； 然 而 ， 由 於 IEEE 
802.15.4標準無法適應性的調整超碼框架構，
故當網路的負載提高，在有限的工作週期之
下，容易導致裝置之間資料的碰撞，因而造成
額外的能量消耗與網路效能的降低。 
為了能依照網路的狀況動態的調整超碼
框的工作週期，一些相關的討論及機制陸續被
提出[7]-[12]。ECAP[13]機制定義了Itone來表示
裝置是否成功將資料傳送出去，當裝置接收到
訊標訊框之後會將Itone設定為閒置(idle)狀態，
當裝置有資料要傳送時，則會在進行閒置通道
評估(clear channel assessment; CCA)前將Itone
設定為失敗(failure)狀態，等到接收到協調者
的確認訊框之後，則會再將Itone設定為成功
(success)狀態，反之則維持不變。等到目前超
碼框的活動週期結束之後，Itone為失敗狀態的
裝置，會發出調整信號(toning signal)告知協調
者，此時當協調者收到有裝置發出調整信號

據IEEE 802.15.4標準定義，其超碼框級數只能
小於或等於訊標級數；而為情況三時，表示目
前的活動區間足夠讓所有的裝置傳送資料，且
所造成的碰撞並不會很嚴重，故協調者並不會
調整超碼框級數；最後為情況四時，表示目前
超碼框佔用比例很高，且碰撞比例也很高，此
時協調者就會比照情況二的方式，遞增超碼框

調整機制，在不同臨界值下之情形進行模擬，
並與ECAP(extended contention access period)
及IEEE 802.15.4標準進行比較。我們假設網路
為飽和(saturation)狀態，且為星狀拓樸之型
態，由一個個人區域網路之協調者及數個裝置
所組成。在網路中所有的裝置全部都是固定

外，我們假設無線通道無雜訊且不考慮錯誤，
且沒有隱藏節點問題(hidden node problem; 
HNP)之存在，即每個裝置的傳送範圍均相

This paper only considers the beacon-enabled mode 
and the transmission of CAP. 
In CAP, a node waits a backoff period (BP) 
UnitBackoffPeriods in backoff boundary if it has data 
to send, where BP is a random number between 0 and 
(2BE-1) and BE is backoff exponent. BE is initially set 
to the value of macMinBE and has the maximum value 
of macMaxBE, where the values of macMinBE and 
macMaxBE are 3 and 5, respectively. Data 
transmission starts after channel clearance is confirmed 
by the two times of clear channel assessment (CCA). A 
sensor node will reassign a BP between 0 and (2(BE+1) 
-1) to wait and attempt CCA again, if any CCA detects 
the channel is used. The transmission fails if the 
number of attempts exceeds the value of 
macMaxCSMABackoff. 
In the traditional CSMA/CA algorithm, a random 
backoff period easily causes an unnecessary waste of 
bandwidth and increases power consumption. 
Therefore, IEEE 802.15.4 suggests that the initial BE 
value (macMinBE) is set to 3. However, if the network 
load is getting heavy, this approach leads to high 
collision rate, high power consumption and low 
network throughput. Conversely, the waiting time is 
getting longer and still has low network throughput if 
the network load is lighter. In addition, when using the 
beacon enabled mode, packet transmission must be 
finished before the end of a CAP; otherwise packets 
must be delayed until the next superframe and wait 
again, but it significantly increases the probability of 
packet collision at the beginning of a superframe. One 
can transmit its data by using GTS, but it is not suitable 
for different packet sizes and induces bandwidth waste 
problem [7]; otherwise, the assignment procedure of 
GTS may be complicated and time-consumed. 
Some algorithms have been proposed to solve the 
above-mentioned problems, such as the fast collision 
resolution (FCR) [8], the exponential increase 
exponential decrease algorithm [9], the state transition 
scheme (STS) [10], the linear/multiplicative increase 
and linear decrease (LMILD) [11] and the memorized 
backoff scheme with the exponential weighted moving 
average (MBS+EWMA) [12]. In [8]-[10], sensor nodes 
use different mechanisms to reduce waiting time after 
they have successfully transmitted packets, which 
make them possible to increase the successful 
transmission rate. They can improve the utilization of 
transmission channel but increase the failure rate in the 
transmission of packets for low-throughput sensor 
nodes. In [11], the collided nodes increase the waiting 
time by a multiple times if collision occurred, while the 
nodes detected collision increase the waiting time by a 
linearly way. Conversely, the waiting time will be 
decreased by a linear way after the successful 
transmission. In [12], the coordinator dynamically 
adjusts the initial value of BE according to the traffic 
load in the previous superframe, but it is only suitable 
in low dimension IEEE 802.15.4 network. Furthermore, 
[8], [9], and [11] cannot directly be used for the IEEE 
802.15.4 standard, because they are designed for the 
IEEE 802.11 standard [13]. In order to solve the 
problems of low throughput and high collision rate for 
the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, we study the random 
waiting time and propose a delayed backoff algorithm 
(DBA), which is expected to improve the network 
performance at the same power consumption. 
 
2. Description of the delayed backoff 
algorithm (DBA) 
A long random backoff time causes ineffective channel 
utilization, but a short one may suffer from high 
collision rate. Thus, it is very important to select a 
suitable backoff time. The delayed backoff algorithm 
(DBA) is expected to improve the channel utilization 
and collision rate by assigning different backoff time to 
the nodes needed to send data. We assume that the 
coordinator can allocate a backoff period for the next 
transmission of a sensor node according to its demand 
during the current transmission. DBA consists of two 
stages: backoff period assignment stage and data 
transfer stage. 
 
2.1 Backoff period assignment stage 
In order to reduce the collision probability in packet 
transmission, it should be possible for each packet to 
use different backoff periods. In order to assign 
different backoff periods to sensor nodes, four 
parameters are defined as: CurrentBPi, NextBPi, 
AssignedBPi and AssignedNextBPi. CurrentBPi is the 
initial BP if the sensor node can use CSMA/CA to 
transmit packet in the ith superframe. NextBPi is the 
initial BP if the sensor node can only begin backoff or 
still has packet in the (i+1)th superframe. AssignedBPi 
and AssignedNextBPi are BPs that already assigned for 
sensor nodes to be used in the ith and (i+1)th 
superframes, respectively. CurrentBPi and NextBPi are 
maintained by sensor node, while AssignedBPi and 
AssignedNextBPi are maintained by coordinator. The 
simplified flowcharts of sensor node and coordinator in 
the backoff period assignment stage are shown as Fig. 
2 (a) and (b), respectively. The assignment procedure is 
described below: 
 
 Fig. 4 An example of using DBA 
 
each UBP boundary until the channel is idle, and the 
value of CurrentBPi is decreased by 1. 
5. A frame can be sent if the value of CurrentBPi is 
equal to 0 and CCA is performed. 
6. A sensor node will use the traditional CSMA/CA to 
get channel if the value of CurrentBPi is 0 and still 
cannot send a frame to the coordinator. At this time, 
the value of CurrentBPi is set to -1, which means 
that the frame cannot successfully be transmitted by 
using the BP assigned by coordinator. In this 
situation, the traditional CSMA/CA is used to 
transmit frame. Furthermore, the number of CCAs 
before transmitting a frame is set to 3 to avoid 
collision occurred between the nodes using the 
traditional CSMA/CA and DBA. 
 
Figure 4 shows an example of using DBA. At the 
beginning of the ith superframe, the values of 
CurrentBPi for nodes A, C and D are 1, 0 and 2, 
respectively. Node B has packet waiting for 
transmission, but its CurrentBPi is not preset. After 
receiving the beacon frame of the ith superframe, nodes 
A, C and D immediately perform CCA on backoff 
period boundary and then delay for CurrentBPi UBPs. 
Node C directly transmits its packet to the coordinator 
after CCA, because the CurrentBPi of node C in the ith 
superframe is 0. After node C transmits its packet to the 
coordinator, the values of CurrentBPi for nodes A and 
D become 0 and 1, respectively, and DBA keeps 
running. Node B waits for transmission after the other 
nodes complete their transmissions, because it uses the 
traditional CSMA/CA. When node B completes its 
transmission, the coordinator uses DBA and assigns 
CurrentBPi and NextBPi for node B to transmit its 
packet in the ith and (i+1)th superframe. 
3. Performance Evaluation 
This section analyzes and compares the performance 
measurements obtained by simulation experiments. 
Since DBA is proposed and based on IEEE 802.15.4 
LR-WPAN, we simulate the traditional CSMA/CA, 
MBS+EWMA, STS and DBA by using Visual C++ 
programming. We focus on the 2.4 GHz ISM band and 
the maximum data rate of 250 kbps. In the first 
scenario, the number of nodes is equal to 25 (N=25) 
and arranged in a 5×5 grid with the coordinator located 
at the center; the coordinator can communicate with all 
other nodes. We consider the beacon-enabled network 
and assume that the superframe does not contain 
inactive period (BO=SO) and CFP. To investigate the 
effects of different packet length, we consider two 
kinds of mean packet length L: 60 and 120 bytes. The 
packet arrival rate of each node follows the Poisson 
distribution with a mean of λ, i.e., the traffic load is 
equal to (N×λ×L×8)/250 kbps. We assume that each 
node has the queue length of 10 frames in the simulated 
time of 600 seconds. In order to simulate the 
performance of power consumption, we consider the 
radio parameters of Chipcon's CC2420 2.4 GHz for the 
IEEE 802.15.4 RF transceiver [14], where the 
transmitting power, the receiving power and the idle 
power are 31mW and 35mW and 30mW, respectively 
[5]. 
Figures 5 and 6 show the goodput and delivery 
ratio against traffic load, respectively. DBA can 
effectively increase the goodput and delivery ratio 
according to the traffic variation for different packet 
length because of the reduction of unnecessary backoff 
time. However, for the MBS+EWMA and STS, both 
goodput and delivery ratio are almost the same as the 
results of IEEE 802.15.4. Firstly, the maximum value 
However, when the traffic load is higher than 0.75, the 
goodput and delivery ratio of MBS+EWMA is better 
than STS, because the maximum value of initial BE of 
MBS+EWMA is 3, which is larger than STS and 
decreases the collision rate. Fig. 11 shows the power 
consumption per packet when N=9, which shows that 
DBA can reduce the power consumption per packet. 
Figs. 12, 13 and 14 show the goodput, delivery ratio 
and power consumption per packet for N=49, 
respectively. Although the power consumption of each 
packet is almost the same, DBA still has benefit in 
goodput and delivery ratio.
