Abstract
In this project, we propose an efficient
algorithm for joint estimation of carrier frequency
offsets (CFOs) and directions of arrival (DOAs)
in interleaved orthogonal frequency division
multiple access/space division multiple access
(OFDMA/SDMA) uplink systems. The algorithm
utilizes the signal structure by estimating the
CFOs and DOAs in a hierarchical tree structure in
which two CFO estimations and one DOA
estimation are performed alternately. Moreover, to
enhance the estimation accuracy and reduce the
computational overhead, a temporal filtering
process and a spatial beamforming process are
invoked in between the CFO and DOA
estimations to progressively decompose the
signals into subgroups containing a single
interference-free signal. Simulations demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can achieve a
satisfactory performance for both CFO and DOA
estimation in OFDMA/SDMA uplink systems.

二、計畫緣由與目的
Because of their high spectral efficiency and
spatial multiplexing gain, OFDMA/SDMA
systems have the potential to support flexible
high-speed wireless communications [1].
However, in OFDMA systems, the CFOs induced
by oscillator mismatch and/or Doppler shift
destroy the orthogonality among subcarriers and
incur inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-user
interference (IUI), which seriously impact the
system performance. On the other hand, by
utilizing the SDMA information, i.e., the DOAs of
all active users, it is possible to achieve efficient
channel allocations in the media access control
(MAC) layer, positioning/ranging, downlink
beamforming, and diversity selection/combining
to reduce the spatial multiple access interference
(MAI), and thereby increase the data throughput.
Thus, estimating the CFOs and DOAs in
OFDMA/SDMA uplink systems is important.
Several approaches for CFO estimation in
OFDMA uplink systems have been proposed. For
example, Lin et al. [2] presented a
correlator-based approach to estimate CFOs;
however, the accuracy is not satisfactory in an
interference-rich scenario. Sun et al. [3] proposed
a pilot-aided CFO estimation scheme, but the pilot
symbols reduce the spectral efficiency. Pun et al.
[4] utilized an alternating projection technique
that replaces the multidimensional search with a
sequence of mono-dimensional searches in the
maximum-likelihood approach. However, it needs
training blocks and the computational complexity
of mono-dimensional searches is high. Cao et al.
[5] developed a blind CFO estimation method for
interleaved OFDMA uplink systems based on the
high resolution multiple signal Classification
3symbols of the thk user; and k is the effective
CFO of the thk user [5], i.e., ( )k k k C     ,
where k is the CFO of the thk user normalized
by the subcarrier spacing. Note that in interleaved
OFDMA systems, the effective baseband signal of
the thk user, kvd , is periodic with period S , i.e.,
( )k v mS kvd d  . Therefore, the received signals
satisfy 2( ) k
j m
k v mS kvr e r
 
  , where m is an
integer [5]. In the uplink of a macrocell BS, the
spatial signature is not parameterized by a discrete
DOA due to the presence of scatterers. Here, we
assume that the scatterers are positioned far from
the antennas of the BS, such as in a rural
macrocell environment or military radar
applications, so the angular spread in the uplink is
very small or close to zero [11]. Hence, for the
thk user, the DOA of a signal cluster can be
approximated by the main DOA, denoted by k.
In addition, to simplify the algorithm’s description, 
we assume each user has only one path and that it
is uncorelated with other users’ paths. However, 
the algorithm can be easily extended to multipath
and large angular spread scenarios. The correlated
path problem can be avoided by using the well
known spatial smoothing technique for the
subspace-based algorithms. Consequently, the
OFDMA block received at the thm antenna of
the BS can be expressed as

and without loss of generality, it is assumed that
2  , and ( )sink ku   . Assume that users can
share the same subchannels or they have the same
DOAs, but not both. Our objective is to jointly
estimate the effective CFOs, { }kw , and DOA, { }k ,
of these K users.
PROPOSED FAST ALGORITHM：
The proposed algorithm begins by estimating
the effective CFOs of the incoming signals,
because, in general, there is more temporal data;
hence, we can derive a more precise effective
CFO estimate. To achieve this, we stack the
OFDMA blocks received at the base station into a

Note that fR and W share the same column

used to estimate the CFOs. More specifically,
taking the eigendecomposition of fR , we can
obtain fE , which contains the eigenvectors
corresponding to the P largest eigenvalues of
fR , where P denotes the number of resolvable
signals. Using the rotational invariance property,

Assume that the number of groups, P , and
the number of signals in each group, iQ , have
been properly determined, e.g., based on the AIC
or MDL criterion. The steps of the algorithm are
as follows: i) (Coarse effective CFO estimation):
Estimate the covariance matrix 1ˆ Hf ff MS  X XR
and invoke 1-D ESPRIT to obtain a set of coarse
CFO estimates as  1 2ˆˆ Pˆw w w  . ii) (Group

signals allocated to different subchannels into
different groups with the temporal filtering matrix
if
P in (5), and generate the filtered data matrix
7of subcarriers in the OFDMA system is N =1024,
divided into 8C subchannels. There are 3
users, whose DOAs are chosen at random as
[ 41 39 37o o o   ], and they are allocated
subchannels 1 2 3{ } {3 5 5}   . Therefore,
users 1 and 2 are allocated the same spatial
channel but different frequency subchannels;
whereas, users 2 and 3 are allocated the same
frequency subchannel but different spatial
channels. Their CFOs are [0.15, -0.31,-0.21]
respectively. Only one OFDMA block is used to
estimate the CFO and DOA covariance matrices
and 300 Monte Carlo trials are conducted in the
simulations. Note that the Cramer-Rao lower
bound is also provided for reference.
For CFO estimation, we compare the
performance of four algorithms: 1-D ESPRIT
(referred to as the 1-D C-ESPRIT) [7], alternating
projection frequency estimation (APFE)[4], 2-D
ESPRIT [10], and the proposed algorithm. Recall
that 2-D ESPRIT and our algorithm determine the
CFOs and DOAs simultaneously. The RMSEs of
the CFO estimates versus the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) based on the above algorithms are shown
in Fig. 1. The results demonstrate that 1-D
C-ESPRIT and APFE are not applicable here
because they can not distinguish if users are
allocated the same subchannel in the
OFDMA/SDMA uplink. On the other hand,
because of the group decomposition feature, the
proposed algorithm’s performance is close to that 
of 2-D ESPRIT. The latter achieves a superior
performance in the high-SNR region because it
stacks the received 2-D data and then applies the
ESPRIT algorithm, so the estimation accuracy
improves more than that of the proposed
algorithm as the SNR increases. Next, we
compare the RMSEs of the CFO estimates versus
the total number of subcarriers when the
SNR=5dB and the number of subchannels is fixed
at 8C , as shown in Fig. 2. We observe that as
the total number of subcarriers increases, the
performance also improves because the number of
effective snapshots increases. However, the rate of
improvement becomes less noticeable as the
number of subcarriers become large.
For DOA estimation, we compare three
algorithms: 1-D ESPRIT (1-D D-ESPRIT) [8],
2-D ESPRIT [10], and the proposed algorithm
Figure 3 shows the RMSEs of the DOA estimates
versus the SNR. Once again, 1-D D-ESPRIT can
not resolve the DOAs because users 1 and 2 share
the same SDMA channel, but the proposed
algorithm’s performance is close to that of 2-D
ESPRIT. Figure 4 shows the RMSE of the DOAs
versus the total number of subcarriers. As the total
number of subcarriers increases, the DOA
estimation accuracy also improves because the
number of effective snapshots increases. However,
the rate of improvement becomes less noticeable
as the number of subcarriers becomes large.
In summary, we have proposed an efficient
hierarchical ESPRIT for joint estimation of the
CFOs and DOAs in interleaved OFDMA/SDMA
uplink. Because the algorithm interweaves the
parameter estimation and interference cancellation
processes, and progressively decomposes signals
into finer subgroups, it yields high estimation
accuracy, low computational overhead, and
automatic pairing of the two parameters.
Simulations show that the proposed approach can
achieve a satisfactory performance even with
close effective CFOs or DOAs.

Abstract—This paper addresses a fast algorithm for joint
estimation of the two-dimensional (2-D) angles and polarization
of the impinging signals based on a novel hierarchical space-
time decomposition (HSTD) technique. The proposed algorithm
makes use of a sequence of one-dimensional (1-D) Estimation
of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ES-
PRIT) algorithms to estimate these parameters alternatively in a
hierarchical tree structure. Furthermore, a spatial beamforming
process is invoked in between the 1-D ESPRIT algorithms to
progressively partition signals into finer groups to enhance the
estimation accuracy and to mitigate the contaminated noise. With
such an ingenious tree-structured estimation scheme, the pairing
of these parameters is automatically determined without extra
hardware or computational cost. Simulation results show that
the new algorithm provides satisfactory performance but calls for
drastically reduced computations compared with previous works.
I. INTRODUCTION
Signal polarization and its diversity have been used in
modern wireless communications [1] as well as in various
types of radar systems. The incorporation of signal polarization
information has led to improved angle estimates and signal
syntheses. It is thus of importance to estimate the angles and
polarization of the incoming signals impinging on an antenna
array.
A number of algorithms have been addressed for jointly
estimating the angles and polarization of the impinging signals
from polarized sensor array data. The classic maximum like-
lihood approach, despite asymptotically efficient, requires an
enormous amount of computations [2]. On the other hand, the
subspace-based algorithms, most notably the multiple signal
classification (MUSIC) [3] and the ESPRIT [4], strike a good
balance between the estimation accuracy and complexity with
limited snapshots. For example, Li et al. [5] addressed an
efficient ESPRIT-based algorithm for joint angle and polar-
ization estimation with a COLD array. Hua [6] proposed a
pencil-MUSIC for the 2-D angle and polarization estimation.
However, despite its effectiveness, [6] stacked the received data
to simultaneously estimate the parameters and thus called for
high computational overhead due to taking the eigendecompo-
sition of a large matrix. Furthermore, [5], [6] required an extra
pairing process. To eliminate the cumbersome pairing process,
[7] considered an ESPRIT-based algorithm for the estimation
of the 2-D angles and polarization. The computations required
by [7], however, are still high and it, additionally, requires
more dipoles and loops of arrays to achieve this.
In order to enhance the estimation accuracy with low
hardware or computational overhead, this paper proposes a
low complexity tree-structured 1-D ESPRIT-based algorithm
to jointly estimate the 2-D angles and polarization of the
signals arriving at an antenna array with crossed dipoles. The
proposed algorithm estimates the 2-D angles and polarization
alternatively in a hierarchical tree structure. The intrinsic data
structure is fully exploited and the data are ingeniously stacked
so that only a sequence of the 1-D ESPRIT algorithms are
required. In addition, spatial beamforming processes are in-
voked in between the 1-D ESPRIT algorithms to progressively
partition the signals into finer groups to enhance the estimation
accuracy and to mitigate the contaminated noise. With such
an ingenious tree-structured estimation scheme, the pairing
of these parameters is automatically achieved without extra
hardware or computational cost. Simulation results show that
compared with previous works the new algorithm provides sat-
isfactory performance but substantially reduced computations,
as it only involves the 1-D ESPRIT algorithms.
II. SIGNAL MODEL
Consider a uniform rectangular array (URA) with M ×N
crossed dipoles spaced Δx and Δy in the x-axis and y-axis,
respectively. Assume that there are K uncorrelated narrow-
band transverse electromagnetic (TEM) wave sources with
the center frequency fc and amplitudes {sk(t)}.Note that the
polarization of a TEM wave is often specified by two real
parameters, γi(0 ≤ γi ≤ π/2) and ηi(−π ≤ ηi ≤ π), so the
polarization vector, ui = [exi eyi ]T , can be defined as
exi = cos θi cosφiE sin γie
jηi − sinφiE cos γi (1)
eyi = cos θi sinφiE sin γie
jηi + cosφiE cos γi (2)
where E is the antenna sensitivity, which is an arbitrary
(nonzero) complex constant, φi and θi, are elevation and
azimuth angles of the ith incoming signal, respectively.
At time instant t, the signal observed at the output of the
crossed dipole at the (m,n) antenna element can be expressed
as [6]

For a precise estimate of αi,j , we partition Yi,j(t) column-
wise into 2 N ×M sub-block matrices and then re-stack them
as
Xi,j(t) = [Yi,j(t)(:, 1 : M)T Yi,j(t)(:,M + 1 : 2M)T ] (15)
Based on (16), it can be shown that Xi,j(t) renders
Xi,j(t) ∼= si,j(t)a¯i,j(ui,j ⊗ b¯i,j)T + NXi,j (t) (16)
where NXi,j (t) is constructed by Pi,jNYi in the same way as
Xi,j(t) from Yi,j , whose covariance matrix is given by
1
2N
E[NXi,j (t)N

Xi,j (t)] = σ
2
i,jPi (17)
where σ2i,j =
(M−q+1)(N−ri+1)
MN σ
2
n. Eq. (17) implies that
the noise component in NXi,j is not white. It, however,
can be shown that aˆi,j = Piai,j is the eigenvector with
the largest eigenvalue for the covariance matrix RXi,j =
1
2N E[Xi,j(t)X
H
i,j(t)] [9].
Note that a¯i,j in (16) does not possess the Vandermonde
structure, so the 1-D ESPRIT can not be applied to es-
timate {αi,j}. To overcome this setback, we utilize the
fact that a¯i,j(ui,j,l ⊗ b¯i,j)T lies in the subspace spanned
by the normalized eigenvector vxi,j associated with the
largest eigenvalue of covariance matrix Rxi,j . Therefore, (I−
exi,jv
H
xi,j )Piai,j(ui,j ⊗ b¯i,j)T = 0, then ai,j belongs to the
subspace spanned by the denote Ξxi,j = I−(I−vxi,jvHxi,j )Pi
and Ai,j = [A¯i ai,j ], it can be shown that
Ξxi,j = Ai,j(A
H
i,jAi,j)
−1AHi,j (18)
Note that Ai,j retains the Vandermonde structure and shares
the same column space as Ξxi,j , so the 1-D ESPRIT can be
utilized and we can get more precise estimates of α’s.
After the above 2-D angle estimation, we move on to
estimate the polarization. To achieve this, we partition Yi,j(t)
into 2 N ×M sub-block matrices and then stack them as
Zi,j(t) =

(19)
Base on (14), it can be shown that Zi,j(t) can be re-expressed
as
Zi,j(t) ∼= si,j(t)ui,j(b¯i,j ⊗ a¯i,j)T + NZi,j (t) (20)
where NZi,j (t) is constructed by Pi,jNYi in the same way as
Zi,j(t) from Yi,j , whose covariance matrix is given by
1
MN
E[NZi,j (t)N
H
Zi,j (t)] = σ
2
i,jI (21)
which implies that the noise component in NZi,j (t) remains
white and the noise power is further reduced.
Note that the polarization vector in (20), ui,j , is the
signal eigenvector of the polarization covariance matrix,
RZi,j =
1
MN E[Zi,j(t)Z
H
i,j(t)]. Therefore, taking the eigen-
decomposition of RZi,j to get the normalized eigenvector
associated with the largest eigenvalue, vzi,j , we have vzi,j =
[eˆxi,j eˆyi,j ]
T /‖ui,j‖. Thereafter, we can multiply eˆxi,j and
eˆxi,j with the previous estimated φˆi,j and θˆi,j , which can be
derived from αˆi,j and βˆi,j , to get
Γi,j = tan γi,jejηi,j cos θˆi,j (22)
The polarization γˆi,j and ηˆi,j can then be determined by
γˆi,j = tan−1
|Γi,j |
cos θˆi,j
(23)
and ηˆi =  Γi,j , i = 1, . . . , q, j = 1, . . . , ri (24)
To sum up, the overall steps of the proposed tree-structured
1-D ESPRIT based algorithm can be summarized as follows:
Step 1: (Rough X-axis Angle Estimation) Estimate the covari-
ance matrix Rˆx = 12SN
∑S
s=1 X(ts)X(ts)
H
, where S is the
number of snapshots, and then invoke the 1-D ESPRIT to yield
a set of group x-axis angle estimates {αˆ1, ..., αˆq}, where q is
the number of resolvable α’s.
Step 2: (Spatial Beamforming (I)) Employ {αˆ1, ..., αˆq} to
construct the projection matrix Pi by (7) and then use Pi to
obtain the filtered data matrix Xi(t) = PiX(t), i = 1, ..., q.
Step 3: (Y-axis Angle Estimation of) Stack the data Xi(t), i =
1, ..., q, based on (9) and then estimate the covariance ma-
trix Rˆyi = 12SM
∑S
s=1 Yi(ts)Y
H
i (ts). Thereafter, use the
1-D ESPRIT to get a set of estimates of β’s, say {βˆ1,1,
. . .,βˆ1,r1 ,. . .,βˆq,1,. . .,βˆq,rq}, where ri, i = 1, ..., q, is the
number of β’s in the ith group.
Step 4: (Spatial Beamforming (II)) Employ {βˆi,j} obtained
above to construct the projection matrix Pi,j by (13) and
then use Pi,j to obtain the filtered data matrix Yi,j(t) =
Pi,jYi(t), i = 1, . . . , q, j = 1, . . . , ri.
Step 5: (Precise X-axis Angle Estimation) Partition and re-stack
Yi,j(t) using (15) to obtain Xi,j(ts). Estimate the covariance
matrix RˆXi,j = 12SN
∑S
s=1 Xi,j(ts)X
H
Xi,j
(ts), and utilize
the normalized eigenvector vˆxi,j corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue and the projection matrix Pi to form Ξi,j = I−(I−
vxi,jv
H
xi,j )Pi. Use the 1-D ESPRIT to obtain precise α esti-
mates from Ξi,j . We can then obtain the estimate of elevation
and azimuth angles by φˆi,j = sin−1
√
cos2 αˆi,j + cos2 βˆi,j ,
and θˆi,j = tan−1 cos βˆi,jcos αˆi,j .
Step 6: (Polarization Estimation) Partition and re-stack
Yi,j(ts) as (19) to obtain Zi,j(ts). Estimate the covariance
matrix RˆZi,j = 1SMN
∑S
s=1 XZi,j (ts)X
H
Zi,j
(ts), and utilize
the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigen-
value, vˆzi,j . Use the elements in vˆzi,j to form Γi,j by (22) and
then estimate the polarization, γi,j and ηi,j , i = 1, . . . , q, j =
1, . . . , ri, by (23).
Note that since every subgroup in Step 6 only contains one
signal, the pairing process is automatically achieved without
extra overhead. The number of groups, q, and the number of
signals in each group, ri, are assumed to be known or have
been perfectly estimated, say by the AIC or MDL criterion
addressed in [10].
