1. Introduction   
In recent decades, many researchers have been involved in the study of the displacement of 
liquid by gas. A variety of practical applications have been developed, such as gas-assisted 
injection molding [1][2], fluidized bed [3][4], bio-mechanic process, medical treatment process 
and micro tubes[5] etc. 
Two common research techniques are experimental observation and numerical simulation. 
In the experimental aspect, they observed the shape of the bubble [6], the flow patterns [7] and 
the coating thickness [8]. 
A shape equation of the profile as the water penetrated the oil in a Hele-Shaw cell was 
showed by Saffman & Taylor [6] in 1958. A modified shape equation of the bubble front was 
proposed by Pitts [9] in 1980. By comparing their results with Pitts’ work, a formula for the 
axisymmetric case were proposed by Hsu [10]. A formula for the rectangular tube case was 
proposed by Kamisli [11]. 
Three flow patterns were suggested by Taylor [7]: two kinds of re-circulating flows with a 
low capillary number and by-pass flow with the high capillary number. Gauri and Koelling [8] 
measured the flow field near the bubble tip by using the PTV (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) 
technique and presented the two typical flow patterns suggested by Taylor [7].  
In the numerical aspect, some researchers simulated the flow patterns by solving the Stokes 
equations and the free surface by some interface tracking methods. Three familiar discrete 
methods for the Navier-Stokes equations are: the finite element method (FEM) [12], the finite 
difference method (FDM) [13] and the finite volume (FV) method [14]. 
Polynkin et al. presented the flow pattern ahead of the gas bubble and a generalized criterion 
for the transition between by-pass and re-circulating flow by using the finite element method [15]. 
Hsu et al. [16] showed the range graphically for three flow patterns as the complete bypass flow, 
the recirculation flow and the transient flow by using a finite difference method with successive 
over-relaxation (SOR).  
The level set method (LS) [17] and the volume of fraction method (VOF) [18] are the most 
popular interface tracking methods used in the multi-phase problem simulations. All these two 
interface tracking methods can be associated with the three Navier-Stokes equations solvers, e.g. 
FEM with LS method [19], FV with LS method [14], FV with VOF method [20], FDM with VOF 
method [21], FDM with LS method[22], and FV/FDM with VOF method [23]. 
The Level Set technique is powerful at automatic handling of topological changes, but is 
poor at the mass conservation of the fluid [24]. The Volume of Fluid method conserves mass 
exactly, but is limited by its complexity of the reconstruction procedure [25].  Some improved 
methods were presented by Sussman [26]and Yang [27] to obtain a superior method by 
combining some of the advantages of the volume-of-fluid method with the level set method.  
In this paper, we study the penetration of a long air bubble through a Newtonian fluid in a 
circular tube with both numerical simulation and experimental observation. We simplify this 
circular tube two-phase flow problem to a two-dimensional axisymmetric incompressible 
two-phase flow problem by using the axial-symmetrical characteristic of the circular tube. The 
Navier-Stokes equations are solved by finite difference method (FDM) with neglecting the 
inertial forces effects. Unlike our former research in [16] and in [13] using an empirical deduced 
bubble profile formula in [9], we got the interface information by an interface-tracking method by 
coupling together the level set method with the volume-of-fluid method in section 2.  
In section 3, the penetration of a long bubble through a Newtonian fluid in a circular tube is 
observed by using a charged coupled device (CCD). Both the bubble fronts generated by the 
interface-tracking method and those we observed experimentally are expressed in the form of the 
Pitts’ formula by the curve fitting method. The consistency between the numerical simulation and 
the experiment result is checked in section 4. 
 
2. Mathematical method 
2.1. Model Representation 
    A circular tube with radius R , is filled with a viscous fluid. Air is injected into the tube from 
the entrance located on the left end of the tube. A long bubble is formed as the air steadily expels

Whereψ  is a level function defined as: 0ψ =  for the gas phase, 1ψ =  for the liquid 
phase, and 0.5ψ =  for the interface between liquid and gas.

2.3 Numerical scheme 
The Navier-Stokes equations are solved by FDM with neglecting the inertial forces effects 
described in our early research [16].  
The terms that contain the velocity components,  and , are replaced with ru zu ψ  and ω  
by substituting the stream function ψ  and the vorticity ω  into Eq. (1).  
The stream function ψ  is defined as

And the vorticity ω  is defined as

Instead of using a non-uniform grid in [16], a uniform grid ( ),i jx y  with the resolution 
(100×600) is applied to the discrete system. The finite difference formulas are obtained from the 
terms discrete by a second order central difference method. We solve discredited system by FDM 
with SOR method. The values of ω  and ψ  are calculated iteratively with an over-relaxation 
factor α until the converge criteria Eq. (12) is reached. The value of the over-relaxation factor α is 
1.5 for Re=0. The value of α is adjusted from 0.5 to 0.025 with the value of λ as Re increases 
from 50 to 400.

2.4. Interface tracking scheme 
The evolution of the interface of liquid and gas is performed by the conservative level set 
method [29] which combines some of the advantages of the volume-of-fluid method with the 
level set method. The interface is adverted with the velocity field ( , )r zu u u=

 obtained from Eq. 
(10) by a first order forward difference method. The discrete equation of Eq. (7) with a uniform 
grid ( ,i j )x y can be written as

Pitts showed that the bubble profile formula as Eq. (16) is a good fitness to the bubble 
profile observed forλ= 0.54, 0.67, and 0.77 [9]. (λ is defined as the ratio of the width of bubble 
to the width of the channel.) 
We observe the bubble profile experimentally and simulate the evolution of the bubble 
profile with numerical method. The experiment observed result provides the profile curves with 
λ from 0.704 to 0.953. The numerical simulation result provides the profile curves with λ 
from 0.3 to 0.99.  
The bubble profile curves are fitted by Eq. (18) with the Curve Fitting Tool toolbox of 
MATLAB® and the fitting coefficients are shown as Table 1. The contours of the bubble front 
plotted by experimental observation which is plotted in the solid line and curve fitting which is 
plotted in the dashed and dotted line is shown as Fig5. 
 
4. Result and Discuss 
Fig. 4 illustrates the contours of the bubble front and the distribution of streamline and 
vorticity for λ=0.7, 0.71, 0.8, 0.9, 0.98 and Re=0. The flow pattern is still complete bypass flow 
asλ=0.7. The transient flow pattern, which the stagnation point locates on the centerline between 
the upstream and the bubble tip [33], appears as λ=0.71. The recirculation flow pattern appears 
as λ≧0.72. This result is consistent with [16]: the complete bypass flow appears asλ≦ 1
2
, 
and the transient flow pattern appears as 1
2
≦λ≦0.715, and the recirculation flow pattern 
appears asλ≧0.715.  
The relations of the location of the stagnation point *spz , the ratio of asymptotic bubble width 
to radius of circular tube λ and the Reynolds number Re in the recirculation flow region are 
shown graphically in Fig. 5. As the Reynolds numbers vary from 50 to 400, the values of *spz for 
each λ value reduce only in a very small scope. The stagnation point moves downstream more 
slowly as the velocity of the fluid increases. However, the location of the stagnation point *spz  
obviously is correlated with the value of λ. The stagnation point moves downstream as λ 
increases. A linearly character is shown as 0.72≦λ≦0.9. The tendency of the result agrees with 
that described in [16] which is only applicable within 0.72≦λ≦0.8. I n Fig. 5, the curve with 
‘+’ is the location of the stagnation point *spz  from [16] for the Pitts’ contour as Re=0, and the 
curve with ‘x’ is that for the Pitts’ contour as Re=400. 
The slope

Δ  of 0.9≦λ≦0.98 is steeper than that of 0.72≦λ≦0.9. The stagnation 
point almost moves downstream at a constant velocity as 0.72≦λ≦0.9. However, the 
stagnation point moves downstream more rapidly as λ>0.9. We have extended the applicable 
scope from0.72≦λ≦0.8 up to 0.72≦λ≦0.98.
