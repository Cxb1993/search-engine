The phenomenon makes the hardware idle and leads to low 
hardware efficiency. In addition, the computation of 
bilinear approximation in plane mode complicates the 
hardware realization for high resolution video applications. 
In the literature, there are some H.264 intra encoder 
designs proposed for low complexity intra coding [3-4, 8]. 
For reducing the complexity of computation, the design [3] 
eliminates the I16MB/Chroma plane mode from intra 
prediction and adopts DCT for mode decision. It causes 
apparent quality drop. Besides, there exists much idle time 
in the encoding processing of designs [3-4] when doing 
texture coding. For low operating frequency, the design [8] 
optimizes the processing cycles with variable pixel 
scheduling and modified three-step algorithm. 
In the paper, we propose some optimizing schemes to 
solve the above mentioned problems. In addition, we 
propose a design feasibility called quality scalable intra 
coding to dynamically adjust the video encoding quality in 
terms of configured parameters in the proposed design by 
trading off different power consumption for different 
applications. The proposed design supports different clock 
rates of 26/33/47 MHz, 125/70/85 MHz and 155 MHz to 
respectively encode SD, HD720p and HD1080i video 
sequences with 30fps. As compared to the existing designs 
[3-4], the proposed design owns 42% and 52% reduction in 
terms of the cycle count per MB encoding, respectively. As 
compared to the design [8] that is optimized for low clock 
frequency, the proposed design provides the flexible quality 
scalability for different video coding applications. 
  
2. PROPOSED INTRA CODING ALGORITHM 
For both reducing the complexity of the H.264 intra 
coding and providing the scalable quality of the intra 
coding from algorithmic point of view, we develop 
different fast algorithms for different configurations in the 
proposed design. Fig. 1 shows the proposed low complexity 
search algorithm in luminance intra coding. For reducing 
the complexity, we propose two search techniques for 
luminance intra mode decision, i.e. Context Correlation 
Search Algorithm (CC-SA) and Probability Context 
Correlation Search Algorithm (PCC-SA) [5-6]. By taking 
advantages of spatial correlation of texture between current 
block and neighboring blocks, CC-SA searches less 
prediction modes (3~7 modes) according to intra prediction 
mode in the neighboring blocks (Upper block and Left 
block), as indicated in the right part of Fig. 1. In addition, 
PCC-SA exploits the statistics of intra coding modes in real 
sequences to only search high probability modes for further 
reducing complexity. For intra prediction on chrominance 
pixels, a Quarter MB Search Algorithm (QMB-SA) is 
proposed by observing a fact that human eyes are less 
sensitive to the errors of chrominance pixels than 
luminance ones. Hence, we only perform the intra 
prediction on the left-top block instead of all four 
chrominance blocks in a MB. 
With the proposed algorithm, we support three encoding 
levels of Quality Salability (QS), i.e. QS0, QS1, and QS2 in 
H.264 intra coding. In QS0, we adopt the same mode 
decision algorithm as that in H.264 reference software 
JM93 [7] with no quality loss. In QS1, we adopt the search 
algorithms of CC-SA and QMB-SA in doing intra coding 
with 0.027 dB PSNR loss and 3.61% increase in bit-rates. 
In QS2, we adopt the search algorithms of PCC-SA and 
QMB-SA with only 0.057 dB PSNR loss and 6.63 % 
increase in bit- rates. Using QS1 and QS2 respectively 
reduces 38% and 50 % of computational complexity as 
compared to that in H.264 reference software JM93 [7]. 
Moreover, we can support the feature of quality scalability 
through combinations in using these fast algorithms.

Chroma. Observing the formula of I4MB prediction, we 
find that we can share some intermediate results in 
computing the predictors to reduce hardware cost. Fig. 5 
shows the example of I4MB diagonal down-right mode. 
Predictors of a, b, c and d are computed by “I+2X+A”, 
“X+2A+B”, “A+2B+C”, and “B+2C+D”, respectively. We 
find that there are the same terms of “X+A”, ”A+B”, 
and ”B+C” between predictors of “a and b”, “b and c” and 
“c and d”, respectively. Based on this feature, we only 
compute the same terms one time and share them in the 
computing the other predictors, as shown in Fig. 6. With 
this mechanism, we can eliminate three adders compared to 
the original design.

2.2   Plane Mode Shared Mechanism (PMSM)  
Because the I16MB plane mode needs complex 
computation in intra prediction, the design [3] does not 
support intra16x16 plane mode for reduce the hardware 
cost. As for the design [4], it supports the plane mode 
operation with additional hardware. By analyzing the 
formula of I16MB plane mode shown in Eq. (1), we find 
that we can compute the values of H, V, a, b and c with the 
same architecture of IPG and without additional hardware. 
For example, we divide the equation in computing H value 
into four groups as shown in Eq. (2) and assign them to 
four data-paths as shown in Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, we realize the 
multiplications with shifting and addition/subtraction 
operations. When accumulation is finished, it needs one 
cycle to sum the four results (R1, R2, R3, and R4) of data 
paths together. So, it totally takes 10 cycles to compute 
each H value in the proposed data-path. The computation of 
V value is the same as that for H value. The values of a, b, 
and c could be also calculated by using the shifters and 
adders in IPG.

pre-load the current luminance data of next MB. In the case 
of encoding the first MB, we load current luminance data 
before doing mode decision and texture coding. Using the 
PCDS can save about 96 cycles per MB in average. Fig. 13 
shows the schedule when I4MB is the best intra mode. 
In summary, we have illustrated three timing optimizing 
schemes for the proposed design to reduce about 173 cycles 
per MB as compared to the original schedule shown in Fig. 
9. Table 1 shows the cycle count needed in the tasks of 
different quality scalable modes. The average cycles needed 
in the proposed design when operated at QS0, QS1 and 
QS2 are 1112, 760 and 626, respectively. It also shows that 
we can obtain 1.46 times and 1.77 times of throughput 
improvement when the proposed design operates at QS1 
and QS2 as compared to the QS0 at the cost of finite PSNR 
drop. This feature offers a large flexibility for trading off 
power consumption with quality in various applications [6].

5. IMPLEMENTATION RESULT AND 
COMPARISON  
To support a complete intra encoding system, we also 
implement In Loop Filter, PDSB, AHB interface and other 
System components in the proposed design. The proposed 
intra encoder is implemented by 0.13μm CMOS technology 
with the cost of about 146K gates and 4.43 KB of internal 
SRAM at clock rate of 166MHz, as shown in Table 2. The 
hardware cost of the intra coding module is only 68.93K 
gates. The proposed encoder can respectively encode SD, 
HD720 and HD1080 video sequences at clock rates of 
26/33/47 MHz, 125/70/85 MHz and 155 MHz with 
different quality levels. Table 3 shows the proposed design 
compared with the other designs. We support the same 
encoding flow as H.264 reference software JM93 [7] 
including Hadamard Transform and I16MB plane mode. 
Exploiting the proposed timing optimizing schemes and 
low complexity search algorithms, it can respectively 
encode SD, HD720 and HD1080 video sequences at the 
low clock rate of 26MHz, 70MHz and 155MHz. As 
compared to the existing designs [3-4], the proposed design 
owns 42% and 52% reduction in terms of the cycle count
