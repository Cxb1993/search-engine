一、中文摘要
輕質骨材混凝土（LWAC）中存在於
輕質骨材（LWA）表面的界面過渡區，其
型態和組成結構類似於常重骨材者，也與
水泥漿基體（bulk cement paste）有所差
別。乾燥的輕質骨材會吸入界面水分，改
變過渡區的組構與性質，改善 LWAC 的握
裹強度與性質。
本計畫採用顆粒密度ρa=1.32 g/cm3
的輕質骨材，考慮四種含水狀態（w＝
0%、35％、70％、100％ × S.S.D.）、兩
種水膠比（w/B＝0.35，0.55），拌製輕質
骨材混凝土試體，進行各項基本性質試驗
及微觀結構檢測，主要包括抗壓強度試
驗、電子顯微鏡觀測、壓汞孔隙試驗、微
硬度試驗、X 光繞射試驗及握裹強度試驗
等。
試驗結果顯示，以乾燥骨材（0％）拌
製的輕質混凝土抗壓強度最高，含水率 35
％與 70％者次之，含水率飽和者（100％）
最低，顯示乾燥狀態的輕質骨材，可因吸
入其界面水分而減少過渡區（ITZ）內孔
隙，得以改善其強度，間接提升混凝土強
度。從微觀試驗也發現，輕質骨材含水率
愈低者，ITZ 之 MIP 量測總孔隙量愈少（D
＜35％＜70％＜100％）；微硬度檢驗顯
示，乾燥骨材的 ITZ 有最高之微硬度值，
依含水率到飽和者最低；由 X-ray 試驗也
分析出，ITZ 中的 CH 含量隨輕質骨材含
水率的增加而增多；又由 SEM 觀測出，
骨材含水率愈小者，其 ITZ 內之孔隙有愈
小的趨勢。另外，握裹強度試驗結果同樣
顯示，拌和骨材的含水率愈小者，骨材與
水泥漿間的握裹強度愈大。基於各項試驗
結果可知，輕質骨材的含水率會影響 ITZ
的性質，含水率愈大對 ITZ 性能愈不利，
從而愈不利於輕質混凝土性能。
關鍵詞：輕質骨材混凝土、骨材吸水、界

Abstract
The interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of
lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) has
similar form and structure as those of normal
weight concrete, but being different from
those of the bulk cement paste. Dry
lightweight aggregate (LWA) is apt to suck
its surface water, resulting in changing the
composition of ITZ as well as the properties
and the bond strength of LWAC.
The variables considered in this research
project include one kind of LWA with
partical density of 1.32 g/cm3, three water
content of LWA (w＝0%, 35%, 70%, 100%
× S.S.D.), two water to binder ratios (w/B＝
0.35, 0.55). Standard specimences
prepared with LWAC mixture following the
prementioned test variables were adoped for
the basic property testings, bond strength

三、研究計畫與方法
3.1試驗材料
1) 水泥：使用台泥Ι型水泥，比重為 3.15。
2) 輕質骨材：使用石門水庫淤泥燒製之輕
質骨材，顆粒密度為1.32 g/cm3。其基
本性質列於表1，吸水歷時曲線如圖1
所示。
3) 常重砂：SSD比重2.61，吸水率1.60%
F.M. =2.58。
4) 強塑劑：符合ASTM Type G之強塑劑。
3.2試驗參數與混凝土配比
本研究以不同含水率之輕質骨材拌製
輕質混凝土，探討其界面過渡區的結構特
性及握裹強度變化。試驗之輕質骨材顆粒
密度為 1.32 g/cm3，一天吸水率為 7.55%，
三天吸水率則為 10.13%。研究將三天吸水
率視為飽和狀態（100%）。輕質骨材處理
成 0%、35%、70%、100%四種含水率，
用以拌製 LWAC 試體。水灰比分 0.35 及
0.55 兩種，各組混凝土配比如表 2 所示。
試驗代號說明︰LC 代表輕質混凝土；3 代
表水灰比 0.35，5 代表水灰比 0.55；其後
為骨材含水狀態︰D 為絕乾狀態，35 為含
水 35%，S 為飽和狀態。
3.3試驗方法
試驗包括力學性質和微觀檢測兩部
分。其中，力學性質有抗壓強度及握裹強
度；微觀試驗則包括 X-ray、MIP、微硬度
及 SEM 等。除抗壓試驗之齡期分 7、28、
91 及 180 天等四種外，其餘各項試驗齡期
皆只取 7 及 28 天兩種。抗壓強度試驗之圓
柱試體尺寸為 10ψ× 20 cm，每一組 3 個
試體。握裹強度試驗則參考 Husen[21]所提
出的方法，試體如圖 2 所示，其右半側為
輕 質 骨 材 ， 左 半 側 則 為 水 泥 砂 漿
（W/C=0.36），利用撓曲試驗。
四、研究成果與分析
4.1 新拌混凝土性質
表 2 為所有混凝土的配比，其中輕質
骨材有四種吸水率。表 3 為各組混凝土的
坍度試驗結果。表中顯示，各組混凝土之
新拌坍度為 15±3cm，都與原設計之坍度
相符。至於 30 分鐘後的坍度，各組混凝土
都明顯減小，特別是以絕乾輕質骨材所拌
製之混凝土，其 30 分坍度只剩下約 2cm，
可見乾燥骨材於拌合後仍持續的在吸水，
工作性因而大幅下降。
4.2硬固混凝土力學性質
各組混凝土的抗壓強度發展如圖 3 及
圖 4 所示。由圖中可知各組輕質混凝土之
強度至 28 天時即趨於穩定，其 180 天強度
相對於 28 天者約只成長 10%左右。再者，
於相同水灰比條件下，其輕質骨材含水率
越少者強度越高；其中又以 LC3-D 及
LC5-D 最高。此乃因乾燥輕質骨材於拌合
過程中，會吸入過渡區水分使過渡區內孔
隙減少，而可提升混凝土強度。而骨材含
水狀態為飽和者（LC3-S、LC5-S）則因內
部充滿了水分，於拌合過程中水分反而會
釋出致使骨材與漿體間之過渡區水灰比提
高，強度因而降低。
混凝土握裹強度的試驗結果如圖 5 所
示。由圖中可觀察出，輕質骨材的含水狀
態對骨材-砂漿握裹強度有明顯之影響；絕
乾骨材之握裹強度最高，而含水率 35%者
次之。可見輕質骨材含水率≦35%時，漿
體對骨材的握裹情形良好，其過渡區可能
較不明顯。當骨材含水率≧70%時，漿體
將受到釋出水分之阻檔，而無法有效進入
骨材表面，握裹能力因而下降。此外，多
餘水堆積也會造成較高的水灰比，過渡區
之範圍變大其結構也較為鬆散。
基於上述可知，輕質骨材含水率對
LWAC 之界面過渡區有直接的影響，會改
變其力學性質。輕質骨材含水率≦35%的
混凝土，擁有較高的抗壓強度，其骨材-
漿體握裹情形也可大幅改善。
4.3硬固混凝土微觀性質
兩系列混凝土過渡區之 MIP 試驗結
果如圖 6 及圖 7 所示。圖上顯示，各系列
混凝土其 28 天齡期之過渡區內總孔隙含
量都小於 7 天齡期者；且於相同水灰比條
件下，輕質骨材之含水率越少者，其過渡
區之總孔隙量越低（即 D<35<70<S）。可

ABSTRACT:
The size effect of reinforced lightweight concrete beams was investigated in this research. Three beam specimens
with the sizes were adopted. Totally six beams were fabricated and tested in this experimental program. The results
turned out an apparent flexural behavior for all the beams. For a given concrete mixture, the ductility in terms of the
ratio of ultimate deflection to yielding deflection decreases with the increase of the scale of the specimen.
Lightweight concrete specimen behaves a stronger ductility decay rather than normal concrete. It was also observed
that the ultimate deflection to span ratio decreases with the increase of the specimen scale.
Keywords: size effect, lightweight concrete, reinforcement, ductility, flexural
1. INTRODUCTION
Taiwan is geologically rich of the mineral resources of
clay, shale, slate and mud stone, etc., which can be used
as raw materials of lightweight aggregates. And the
reservoir silt comes from the weathered rocks, which
was washed and eroded by the rainwater, then flows
into rivers and finally deposits on the bottom of a
reservoir. As the silt is accumulated to a huge amount,
it could reduce the storage capacity of water in the
reservoir. However, a compromise approach has been
achieved in Taiwan, which uses the reservoir silt to be
fritted into lightweight aggregates. Thus, not only the
silt can be recycled as aggregates, but the life of the
reservoir can be extended.
In literatures, a great number of researches have been
conducted in the behavior of lightweight concrete
[1-10]. It is known that the properties of lightweight
aggregate concrete are influenced by concrete mixture
as well as the texture of lightweight aggregate. The
difference of lightweight aggregate concrete from
normal concrete mainly includes unit weight,
compression strength, modulus of elasticity and heat
insulation. It was adopted as construction materials
for structural design in the ACI code since 1963 [11].
However, those design regulations relating to
lightweight concrete were directly modified from those
of normal concrete. It is felt necessary and valid to
figure the behavior of lightweight concrete elements
through the full-scaled tests.
On the other hand, recent researches have revealed that
the strength of structural element relies significantly on
the fracture process zone and the size effect exists in
the structure itself [12-16]. Generally speaking, the
failure of concrete is dominated by the fracture process,
rather than the strength criterion. Researches in
non-linear fracture mechanics area in the past have
successfully predicted the size effect [17-21] of the
concrete structure. Bazant proposed a model for
application to predict the size effect of concrete beam,
as described in Equation (1), which ın is the nominal
strength, d is the depth of specimen, ft is the tensile
strength of the material, B and d0 are parameters of the
model. This can be demonstrated in Figure 1.

All the results determined from the tests are listed in
Table 3. It is observed from Figures 3 to 5 that for a
given dimension and strength, the load versus
displacement curve for both normal concrete specimen
and lightweight concrete specimen appear similar, but
the former has a higher yielding strength and ultimate
strength in each case. It can also be seen in Table 3
that the displacements at yielding strength and ultimate
strength for lightweight concrete specimens appear
lower than those normal concrete specimens. This can
be attributed to the toughness of aggregate which
dominates the failure characteristic of specimen.
Lightweight aggregates turn out weaker strength and
more brittle.

The ultimate deflection ratios reduce to 77% and 45%
for normal concrete specimens and lightweight concrete
specimens, irrespectively, which also implies that the
lightweight concrete specimen performs more strong
decay in ultimate deflection ratio than those normal
concrete specimens. It is also noted that the ultimate
deflection ratio of the lightweight concrete specimen
with the depth d = 600 mm, which has exceeded the
limitation, 1/180, by the ACI Code. This is attributed
to the absence of stirrups in the concrete specimens.
However, it is still felt valid and necessary that the
limitation of deflection in the present building code
should be revised by considering the size effect.
5. CONCLUSIONS
From the test results, several significant results can be
drawn and stated following:
(1) The ductility for both concretes is reduced with
the increase of dimension of the specimen ±
namely, a larger concrete specimen performs less
ductile.
(2) The ductility of lightweight concrete specimens
decays much more than that of normal concrete
specimens from the relationship of ductility and
the effective depth.
(3) The load and deflection at yielding strength point
as well as at ultimate strength point increases with
the increase of specimen dimension for both
normal concrete and lightweight concrete
specimens; while the ultimate deflection ratios
reduce with the increase of dimension for both
concrete specimens.
(4) The ultimate deflection ratios reduce to 77% and
45% for normal concrete specimens and
lightweight concrete specimens, irrespectively,
which also implies that the lightweight concrete
specimen performs more strong decay in ultimate
deflection ratio than those normal concrete
specimens.

ABSTRACT: 
In this research, we use the high-strength concrete mixtures cooperated with self designed edge restrained plate 
mould of 600 × 600 × 100 mm in dimension, embedding optic fiber sensors at different depth to cast the slab 
specimens for experiment. It was expected to find the specific volumetric performance of high-strength concrete 
slab by measuring the deformation at early age (within 4 days). Test results showed that increasing the replacement 
ratio of fly ash will only make insignificant influences on the shrinkage deformation of HSC slab at early age. 
Increase of the replacement ratio of silica fume in HSC can enhance the shrinkage deformation of HSC slab at early 
age. It is significantly found that shrinkage deformation of HSC slab at early age is dominantly influenced by the 
restrained condition of slab sides. A free end edge will exhibit larger shrinkage deformation than that of the 
restrained edge.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The main factors responsible for the concrete cracking 
at early age are temperature deformation and shrinkage 
deformation. The deformation will induce tensile 
stresses in concrete and may appear cracking. The crack 
at early age is apt to be occurred in high strength 
concrete (HSC) [1-2]. The reason is that HSC with 
lower water to binder ratio containing higher cement 
content and lower water content than normal concrete 
(NC). High cement content will release high hydration 
reaction heat and the low water content makes concrete 
shrink easily. Hence, HSC is apt to appear cracking at 
early age due to temperature and shrinkage deformation. 
Freedman [3] reported that increasing the amount of 
cement per cubic meter of concrete to 59 kg increased 
the temperature by up to 6~8 ͠ in HSC. A high 
cement content of around 600 kg/cm3 without the 
inclusion of Pozzolanic materials can increase the 
temperature to 60 ~ 80 ͠, negatively affecting the 
volumetric stability of HSC. 
A slab cast with HSC typically has a relatively large 
exposed surface, enabling rapid to evaporation rapidly, 
a decline in exterior temperature while the internal 
temperature continues to rise by hydration. Thus, a 
temperature gradient introduces to the slab, causing an 
irregular temperature change and inducing surface 
cracking. Besides, if the rate of surface evaporation 
exceeds the rate at which bleed water reaches the 
surfaces, shrinkage crack will also be caused [4, 5].
Langan [6] reported that concrete with fly ash and silica 
fume can exhibit delayed hydration, reduced the heat of 
hydration, and a reduced rate of the hydration reaction 
of the silica fume at early age because of the effect of 
fly ash. Moreover, the rate of shrinkage of HSC is 
increased by increasing the silica fume content at early 
age [7].
If the shrinkage of concrete from above-mentioned can 
free shrink, the cracking will not occur. Weiss [8]
compared the free shrinkage of HSC to NC at early age 
by ASTM C341 (1996), indicated that the magnitude of 
shrinkage of HSC at 3 days is 3 times to NC. The 
shrinkage of HSC at early age is much greater than that 
of NC. However, it is uncommon that the concrete can 
appear free shrinkage, so the research [8] investigated 
the cracking of the HSC slab and the NC slab under 
sides restrained at early age. Test results showed that 
the first crack of NC and HSC appeared at 7 hours and 
3.5 hours, and the average width of crack are 0.75 mm 
and 1.18 mm at 50 days; respectively. Therefore, HSC 
is apt to appear cracking at early age due to large 
shrinkage and restrained condition. 
Nevertheless, the research [8] only considered the 
effects of restrained condition but didn’t measure the 
interior shrinkage deformation of concrete and 
evaluated the difference between HSC and NC by the

When the HSC mixture was ready, it was poured in two 
layers into the moulds while following the compaction 
on each layer. Once the HSC slab specimens were cast, 
they were stored in a controlled room with a constant 
temperature of 23͠ and 50 % R.H.. All the specimens 
were remained in the moulds throughout the whole 
measurement period. The shrinkage deformations were 
monitored immediately after the SOFO sensors were 
connected to the measurement system. The final set up 
in the controlled room, including the measurement 
detecting equipments, is showed in Fig. 3.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
3.1 Shrinkage Deformation of HSC Slab at Early 
Age
The chronological development of the shrinkage 
deformation of slab specimens was carefully observed 
and recorded throughout each test. The measured 
results, as shown in Fig. 4, can be used to interpret the 
shrinkage change immediately after casting and up to 
an age of four day by dividing into five stages: 
1. Initial shrinkage stage: From 0-3 hours, most of the 
top layers and the bottom layers of the concrete 
specimens appear to have a slight swelling deformation 
initially before 1 hour at this stage and then turned to 
shrink. Since the concrete at this stage is in a plastic 
state with nearly zero tensile strength, the plastic 
cracking may occur within this time.  
2. Shrinkage stage: At 3 to 12 hours, the shrinkages of 
the top and bottom layers keep increasing and most 
shrinkage deformation increase slowly except the CH06. 
Its shrinkage deformation increases seriously due to the 
facts that the slab edge is free and the HSC contains 
higher silica fume content.  
3. Second shrinkage stage: At 12-24 hours, the 
shrinkage deformations of the top and bottom layers 
still keep increasing. The increased rate of shrinkage 
deformation at this stage is less than that at shrinkage 
stage.  
4. Slow shrinkage stage: At 24-96 hours (1-4 days), 
the development of shrinkage deformation curves 
continues to decrease gradually in a slower rate until 
steady state. 
5. Steady shrinkage stage: After 4 days, the shrinkage 
deformation of the specimen keeps in a steady state 
only with slight shrinkage change.

Moreover, it can also be found in Fig. 8 that, when the 
FA content keeps constant, the shrinkage deformation 
of HSC slab at early age increase with the increase of 
RSF, despite of increasing the RFA from 10 % to 30 % 
and decreasing the cement content from 390 kg/m3 to 
330 kg/m3. Consequently, we can conclude that. 
Increase of the replacement ratio of silica fume in HSC 
will enhance the shrinkage deformation of HSC slab at 
early age.

3.4 Influence of Sides Restrained Condition on the 
Shrinkage Deformation of HSC Slab 
Fig. 9 shows the measured shrinkage deformation 
development (0-24 hours and 0-96 hours) of sensors 
CH01 (W25S15F10), CH03 (W25S05F30), CH06 
(W25S15F10) and CH08 (W25S15F30). Comparing 
the deformation curves of CH01 and CH03 from Fig. 9,
we can find that, when the silica fume content of HSC 
keeps constant of 30 kg/m3, the CH03 exhibit larger 
shrinkage deformation at early age than that of CH01, 
even though the later has less cement content and 
higher fly ash content. Similar results can also be seen 
from comparison between CH06 and CH08, the former 
has larger shrinkage deformation than that of the later. 
These results interpret the facts that HSC slab without 
sides restrained will induce larger shrinkage 
deformation at early age than that with sides restrained.

of sensors CH02 (W25S05F10), CH06 (W25S15F10), 
CH03 (W25S05F30) and CH07 (W25S15F30). 
Comparing the deformation curves of CH02 and CH06 
from Fig. 10, it can be found that, when the fly ash 
content of HSC keeps constant of 60 kg/m3, the CH06 
demonstrate larger shrinkage deformation at early age 
than that of CH02. Similar situation is also found from 
comparison between CH03 and CH07, the former 
exhibit larger shrinkage deformation than that of the 
later, even though the former has less silica fume 
content.
