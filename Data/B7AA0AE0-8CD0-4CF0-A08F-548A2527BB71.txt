1. Introduction 
 Composite material is used to enhance the lifetime of materials due to the high 
demands on the capabilities and operative life of materials. However, the stress singularities 
induced by the discontinuous character between the different layers may generate cracks and 
the composite medium thus becomes very susceptible to spallation. Thus, the concept of the

the mechanical buckling of circular FGM plates under uniform radial compression based on 
the higher order shear deformation plate theory (HSDT).  Axisymmetric bending and 
buckling of perfect functionally graded solid circular plates are studied  by A.R. Saidi, A. 
Rasouli, S. Sahraee [12]  based on the unconstrained third-order shear deformation plate 
theory (UTST).  L.S. Ma a, T.J. Wang [13] applied the third-order shear deformation plate 
theory (TPT) to solve the axisymmetric bending and buckling problems of functionally graded 
circular plates. And relationships between the TPT solutions of axisymmetric bending and 
buckling of functionally graded circular plates and those of isotropic circular plates based on 
the classical plate theory (CPT) are presented.  
Bending behavior is common in plate structure, therefore understanding the bending 
behavior of transversely functionally graded circular plates is important to assess the safety of 
the plate structure.  X.Y. Li a, H.J. Ding a, W.Q. Chen [14] analyzed the bending of 
transversely isotropic circular plates with elastic compliance coefficients being arbitrary 
functions of the thickness coordinate, subject to a transverse load in the form of ( )kq r .  The 
non-linear axisymmetric and asymmetric behavior of functionally graded circular plates under 
transverse mechanical loading are investigated by Asghar Nosier, FamidaFallah [15]indicated 
that linear analysis is inadequate for analysis of simply supported FG plates which are 
immovable in radial direction even in the small deflection range, and the responses of FG 
materials under a positive load and a negative load of identical magnitude are not the same. 
Based on three-dimensional theory, Wang Yun, Xu Rongqiao, Ding Haojiang [16] investigated 
the axisymmetric bending of transversely isotropic and functionally graded circular plates 
subject to arbitrarily transverse loads using the direct displacement method.  
To the authors’ knowledge, no closed-form solution of circular FGM plates under 
transversely axisymmetric loads has been reported. In this paper, the closed-form solutions of 
circular FGM plates under axi-symmetrically distributed transverse loads are determined by

The stress resultants per unit length of the middle surface are defined by integrating 
stresses along the thickness.  The in-plane axial forces rN ， Nθ，and rN θ  defined by

2.2  The axi-symmetric solution to circular FGM plates with simply supported edges 
 
Consider a simply-supported circular FGM plate with radius a  and uniform thickness 
h  subjected to the axi-symmetric lateral load ( )zq r . The coordinates r  and θ define the 
plane of the plate, whereas the z-axis is in the thickness direction. The Poisson’s ratio of the 
FGM plate is assumed to be constant. The Young’s moduli of the circular FGM plates vary 
continuously only in the thickness direction and is defined based on the sigmoid function

3. Fundamental solution 
In this Section, consideration is focused on the fundamental problem of a 
simply-supported circular FGM plate subjected to concentrated ring load with magnitude Q  
acting at r b= , as shown in Figures 1(a). The fundamental problem is split three 
sub-problems, as shown in Fig. 1(b) ~ Fig. 1(d).   The deflection of the fundamental problem,

of the plates rather than to the top or bottom surfaces of the circular FGM plates, which 
differs from a homogeneous plate. 
4.2 Quadratic distributed load 
Assume that the circular FGM plate shown in Fig. 3(b) is subjected to quadratic 
distributed load 20( ) 1 ( / )q r q r a = −  .  To evaluate the solution of this problem, first the 
concentrated load Q  in Eq. (24) is replaced by

similar to the linearly distributed load in Section 4.1.  The deflection of the circular FGM

To study the effects of the material index p of FGM, the variations of stresses rσ and θσ
along the thickness direction for the material index 1,  2,  5,  10,  20p = and 2 1/ 5E E = fixed 
are plotted in Figure 6, which depicts that the material index p does not obviously affect the 
stresses of FGM plates.  The comparison of stresses 
r
σ , θσ along the radial direction are 
illustrated in Figure 10 for 2 1/ 5,  20E E = , 2p = .  Figure 7 shows that the radial and 
tangential stresses are the same at center of the circular plate.   
  
4.3 Partial uniform load 
Consider a circular FGM plate shown in Fig. 3(c) subjected to partial uniform load with 
magnitude 0q  in the range 0 r c≤ ≤ .  The deflection at r (say point A) is

The formulation in Eq. (24) is the same as that in Ref. [24].   
The variations of stress θσ  along thickness direction for different material gradient 
2 1/ 1,  2,  5,  10,  20E E =  are illustrated in Fig. 9.  The distributions of the bending moments 
along the radial direction for different ratio of /c a  are plotted in Figure10.   
It is obvious that the strains are linear along thickness direction, the stresses in the 
thickness direction are proportional to ( )zE z , but the bending moments are independent of the 
material properties of the FGM plates subjected to transverse loads. Furthermore the stress and 
bending moment for the circular FGM plated subjected to linearly distributed, quadratic 
distributed, and partial uniform loads have the relation as follows :

5 Conclusion  
 
In this work, the closed-form solutions of simply-supported circular FGM plates 
subjected linearly or quadratic distributed, or partial uniform load are obtained by superposing 
the fundamental solution of simply-supported circular FGM plate subjected to a ring load. For  
FGM plates with constant Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus varying along the thickness 
direction, the bending and in-plane problems of the FGM plates under transverse load only can 
be uncoupled by properly choosing the location of the origin of the z-axis.  And then the 
solution of the bending problem of the circular FGM plates can be easily obtained based on the
