Zhu (1990) studied the effect of ambient illumination and found that performance 
deteriorated as ambient illumination increased. 
For the effect of illumination on visual performance and fatigue of using 
electronic paper display, Lin et al. (2008) found that illuminance had no significant 
effect on accuracy for visual tasks on electronic paper. Lee et al. (2008) found that 
ambient illuminance had no significant effect on accuracy performance but had a 
significant effect on searching speed. Shieh and Lee (2007) found that different 
illuminances (200, 700, and 2000 lx) resulted in a significantly different preferred 
viewing distance and screen angle. Higher illuminance (700 and 2000 lx) resulted in a 
longer preferred viewing distance and smaller screen angle. They suggested that 
reflective-type displays may need a large illuminance (700 lx or higher). Wang et al. 
(2008) and Wang et al. (2009) pointed out that participants’ visual performance with 
Electronic paper displays was significantly different under various ambient 
illuminances. In general, the above mentioned studies found that ambient illuminance 
for electronic display need to be higher than CRT or LCD displays and the proper 
range could be from 500 lx to 1000 lx. But the proper range was based on 
experiments of simple word identification task in short period. For longer period and 
complex article reading, it is not clear whether higher illuminance is needed.   
Further, these studies evaluated old type Kolin electronic (Ch-LC) display and Sony 
e-book which were not the main stream in the market. Currently, the most popular 
electronic paper displays are Sony Reader, Amazon Kindle and iRex Reader. Thus, 
there is a need to explore the visual performance and visual fatigue of popular 
electronic paper displays under a long period reading task and compare them with 
reading on ordinary paper.  
 4
In the past, many studies compared reading on displays with reading on paper 
(Dillion, 1992; Gould, 1987). Slower reading speed, lower accuracy, more fatiguing 
and less subjective preference were found for reading on displays (Noyes and Garland, 
2003; Mayes et al, 2001). For the effect of display medium on higher cognitive ability 
such as text comprehension, some studies (Dillon, 1992) concluded the 
comprehension was not different for material presented on paper or displays. But 
Cushman (1986) found the reading speed and comprehension have an inverse 
corelationship. For example, slower reader has higher comprehension. In summary, 
comprehension of a reading material seems not negatively influenced by various 
display media, but it can affect reading speed and indirectly influence comprehension. 
However, most of the above studies focused on CRT or LCD displays, comparison of 
paper with electronic paper display is lacking. Consequently, there is a need to 
explore the effects of electronic paper display type, ambient illuminance, and light 
source on long period reading performance and visual fatigue.  
  To sum up, electronic paper display may in the future to replace conventional 
paper, book or magazine. Studies of electronic paper display are very limited and the 
existing studies used visual search or identification tasks and employed search speed 
or accuracy as dependent measures. Studies that measure higher cognitive 
performance and visual fatigue in a long period reading task are needed. This study 
included two parts. The first part (year 1) investigated the effects of ambient 
illuminance (200, 500, 1000lx) and light source (TL84 and D65) on participants’ 
reading comprehension and visual fatigue in using various Electronic paper displays 
(Amazon Kindle DX, Sony Reader PRS-505-SC, iRex 1000S). A comparison was 
also made between reading on electronic paper displays and on ordinary paper. The 
second part (year 2) explored the effect of character size, interline spacing, and

(middle), and iRex 1000 (right). The text display areas are the same for the three 
displays. 
 
2.1.3 The experiment condition 
The experimental task configuration is shown in Fig. 2. The VDTs was located on 
a table 73 cm in height. The front edge of the table was 17 cm from the screen center. 
The inclination angle of the screen was 105 degree with respect to the horizontal axis. 
The viewing distance was 50 cm. These task set-up parameters were fixed during 
experiment. The participants could adjust their seating height to make themselves as 
comfortable as possible. 
 8
comparison group (10 participants) was based on A4 paper, 500 lux illuminance and 
D65 light source.  
2.1.5 Procedure 
A reading task was conducted to evaluate the participants’ visual performance and 
visual fatigue. A Chinese article with character height of 12pt New Ming style was 
used for the task. The article was a report about earthquake. Since the screen sizes of 
the three types of display are different, this experiment controlled the text display area 
and format exactly the same on each displays (see Fig.1). The text was arranged in 20 
pages long, 17 lines per page, with 20 characters per line. The participants were asked 
to read the text and answer 10 questions about the content as accurate and quickly as 
possible. CFFs were measured before and after the experimental task. In addition, a 
rating scale made of six descriptive items was used to collect a subjective rating of 
visual fatigue (Heuer et al.16): (1) “I have difficulties in seeing”; (2) “I have a strange 
feeling around the eyes”; (3) “My eyes feel tied”; (4) “I feel numb”; (5) “I feel a 
headache”; (6) “I feel dizzy looking at the screen.” Each item was rated on a 10-point 
scale for severity of discomfort, with “1” representing “not at all” and “10” 
representing “yes, very much”.  
2.1.6 Data collection and analysis 
This study collected reading time and comprehension accuracy to evaluate 
participants’ visual performance, CFF change and subjective visual fatigue to evaluate 
visual fatigue. CFF change was the CFF difference before and after the experiment. 
Subjective visual fatigue was determined by the total score of subjective rating of 
visual fatigue. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the effects

Table3 showed that CFF changes of the three electronic paper displays were 
similar. Sony had the smallest CFF change with -2.56 Hz, Amanzon Kindle DX 
second with -2.77 Hz and iRex the largest with -3.04 Hz. ANOVA results showed that 
there was no significant difference among the three displays. However, the CFF 
decrement for the three electronic paper displays was larger than paper for which was 
-2.25 Hz. CFF decrement was the smallest with ambient illuminance 500 lx, brighter 
(1000 lx) or darker (200 lx) illumination resulting in greater CFF decrement. But the 
effect of ambient illumination on CFF change was not statistically significant. CFF

Secondly, though display sizes of the three types of electronic paper display were 
different, the text display area and format were arranged to be exactly the same in the 
experiment (see Fig. 1). Thus, there were the same numbers of text pages for the 
electronic paper displays. If the text had been presented to the full screen of the 
displays, the results might have been different. Compared with reading on paper, 
reading on electronic paper display had similar or even better reading speed and 
comprehension accuracy. That is, electronic paper displays are acceptable media for 
reading, especially for E-Ink® electronic paper displays. Several studies (Shen et al, 
2009; Wang et al, 2009) had similar findings. The suggestions (Dillon, 1992 and 
Gould, 1987) that reading on VDT is slower and less accurate than reading on paper 
may not stand for electronic paper display. However, the participants had less CFF 
decrement and smaller subjective visual fatigue when reading on paper than on 
electronic paper displays, The results were consistent with the findings of other 
studies (Shen et al, 2009; Jeng et al, 2005; Lee et al, 2011). The plausible reason is 
that people have more experience with paper reading. Another reason is that screen 
reflection common to VDTs may also play a role in inducing visual fatigue.  
With the portability of electronic paper display, the ambient illumination for 
electronic paper reading may vary. The results of the present study showed that 
ambient illumination had little effect on subject’s visual performance and visual 
fatigue. The effect of ambient illumination on visual performance was not statistically 
significant even though reading speed showed upward trend, while comprehension 
accuracy had downward trend, with the increase of ambient illumination. Similarly, 
the effect of ambient illumination on visual fatigue was not statistically significant 
either. Subjective visual fatigue increased a little with the increase of ambient 
illumination, while 500 lx had the smallest CFF decrease. These results were

The three types of electronic paper display used were the same as that in year 1, 
that is, Sony PRS-700; Amazon Kindle DX; and iREX 1000S. Other apparatus used 
were also the same as in year 1. 
3.1.3 The experiment condition 
The experimental condition and configuration was the same as in year 1, except 
that the ambient illumination was set at 500 lux, fluorescent light. Luminance contrast 
was set at 1:5. 
3.1.4  Experiment design 
The experiment evaluated three independent variables: display type, interline 
spacing, and character size. The three types of electronic paper used were the same as 
year 1, this is, Sony PRS-700, Amazon Kindle DX and iREX 1000S. Character size 
was defined as the height of a lowercase ‘x’ (x-height). Three character sizes used 
were 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 mm. Interline spacing was defined distance between two 
adjacent lines which was conveniently expressed as a ratio relative to x height. Three 
interline spacing were selected: 50%,66% and 80% of the height of character size. 
Five participants were randomly assigned to each of the 3 (E-Paper type) × 3 
(character size) × 3 (interline spacing) = 27 treatments, 135 participants in total. 
3.1.5 Procedure 
The experimental task and procedure was the same as in year 1, except that 
character size and interline spacing were changed according to the experimental 
design.

CFF change  
Table 5 showed that CFF changes of the three electronic paper displays were 
similar. Sony had CFF change with -2.18 Hz, Amazon Kindle DX -1.74 Hz and iRex 
-1.48 Hz. ANOVA results showed that there was no significant difference among the 
three displays. CFF decrement was smaller with character size 3 mm (-1.38 Hz) and 4 
mm (-1.42 Hz), character size 2 mm resulting in greater CFF decrements (-2.59). The 
effect of character size on CFF change was statistically significant [F(2, 108) = 3.59]. 
CFF decrement under interline spacing 50%, 66%, and 80% were -2.04 Hz, -1.54 Hz, 
and -18.2 Hz respectively. The differences were not statistically significant. 
 22
min of visual angle respectively, at a viewing distance of 500 mm. ANSI/HFS 
specified that under the situation where legibility is critical, the minimum character 
height for a capital letter should be 16 min of visual angle for reading tasks with a 
preferred character height of 20-22 min of visual angle. Translating these into heights 
at our nominal reading distance of 50 cm gives a preferred height of 2.9-3.3 mm. 
Results of this study revealed that reading speed and accuracy increased as character 
height increased from 2.0 to 3.0 mm. Thus, for E-paper, the character height should 
be greater than 2.0 mm and character height of 3.0 mm that subtends a 22 min of arc 
of visual angle might be more suitable. In general, with the increase of character size 
the space needed for the text become larger and thus lengthened the time to visually 
scan the text. However, the results of this study showed that for character sizes 2.0 
mm, 3.0 mm, and 4.0 mm, the advantage of greater size outweighs the disadvantage if 
greater visual scanning was needed. 
The effects of interline spacing on reading time was significant. Reading time 
decreased as interline spacing increased. Increasing vertical word spacing in E-paper 
display could benefit reading speed. Again, larger interline spacing increased the 
space needed for a text. But the results showed that for interline spacing 50%, 
66%,and 80%, the advantage of a larger interline spacing outweighs its disadvantage. 
However, when interline spacing was greater than 66%; i.e., 80%, reading speed and 
visual fatigue did not improve further.
