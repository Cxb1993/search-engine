I. Introduction 
Fillet welds and butt welds are widely used in steel structures for joint connections.  When 
the structures are subjected to cyclic loadings, the welded joints, which have high stress ranges 
() or high stress intensity factor (SIF) ranges (K), are easy to have fatigue or fracture 
problems.  Hence, how to correctly determine/measure stress intensity factors for the fillet- and 
butt-welded joints in the structures are important for fatigue or fracture evaluation.  For complex 
welded joints, stress intensity factors are frequently derived from numerical methods, such as 
finite element method or boundary element method, based on the assumptions of ideal material, 
geometric, stress and boundary conditions.  However, the welded joints at site are usually not as 
ideal as expected.  It is more realistic to devise an experimental approach measuring the stress 
intensity factors directly from the welded joints.  Fig. 1 shows the common butt-welded joints 
connection two unequal thicknesses and two unequal widths.

Fig. 1  The Common Butt-Welded Joints 
The butt-welded joints of two unequal thickness or width steel plates as shown in Fig. 1(a) 
and 1(b) can be simplified as notch problems of plates.  Lin and Tong (1980) developed a hybrid 
element to account for notch-tip singularities.  They used proper normalization of the notch-tip 
element size to minimize the oscillation of the assumed function around the boundaries of the 
element to improve the accuracy of the solution.  Chen (1995) used the body force method to

Fig. 2  Geometry and Coordinate System of a V-notch 
A butt-welded notched joint is usually fabricated by two plates with unequal thicknesses or 
widths welded together by a butt weld of filler metal.  The materials of two plates and the filler 
metal are all steel and have the same young’s modulus (200 GPa).  Therefore, in elastic range, a 
butt-welded notched steel joint problem can be simplified as a notch problem in a steel plate.  
The two-dimensional (2D) in-plane stress and displacement fields of a point P near the V-notch 
tip can be expressed as Eqs. (1) to (5) using the series expansions derived by Williams (1952), 
while the origin of interest is located at the notch tip (Fig. 2).

Fig. 3 shows the geometric shape of a typical double V-notched specimen tested in this 
project.  The double V-notched specimens were made of A36 steel plates (length=300mm, 
width=45mm and thickness = 6mm) and the V-notch of each plate was cut by the wire electrical 
discharge machining (EDM) process.  A total of twenty symmetric double V-notched specimens 
were fabricated respectively by the twenty different notch angles according to the combination of 
four  angles ( = 0, 15, 30, 45) and five 2 angles (2 = 15, 30, 45, 60, 90) in the notch.   
The twenty specimens were classified into A, B, C and D four groups by the four different  
angles ( = 0 for A-group,  = 15 for B-group, = 30 for C-group and  = 45 for D-group) , 
and each group had five specimens of the different 2 angles.  For example, A60 specimen had 
the notch angle of  = 0 and 2 = 60.  Table 1 lists the design and exact dimensions of the 
twenty specimens, and Table 2 shows the notched portions of the twenty specimens.  The twenty 
specimens will be carefully tested by suitable tensile load without damage.

V. Displacement Measurement Using Digital Image Correlation Method 
In this project, the digital images recorded from the previous non-contact optical experiment 
for each specimen were processed by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Method to measure the 
displacement fields near the notch tip.  Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Method employing the 
cross-correlation relation in statistics for matching image patterns has been widely used in 
measuring the displacement fields of a deformed object in solid mechanics (Peters and Ranson 
(1982), Sutton et al. (1983), Chu et al. (1985)).  The cross-correlation coefficient C used for 
matching two image patterns is defined as follows:

VI. Experimental Results 
The mixed-mode stress intensity factors (KI and KII) of a notch can be derived by 
substituting the measured displacement field data obtained from DIC method into the 
least-squares procedure (Eq. (12)).  Tables 3 compares the Mode-I and Mode-II SIF results of 
the twenty double V-notched specimens obtained from the suggested non-contact optical 
experiment and least-squares method with the finite-element results.  The Mode-I and Mode-II 
SIF results of the twenty specimens were normalized to FI and FII as follows:

VII. Self-Evaluation 
After implementing the research project, we have completed the following works: 
(1) Setup the instrumentation for the non-contact CCD camera experiment and developed a 
MATLAB program based on digital image correlation (DIC) method which is able to measure 
the subtle displacements near the notch tip of the notched specimens. 
(2) Developed a program implementing the least-squares procedure to determine the mixed-mode 
stress intensity factors for notched joints. 
(3) Finished the CCD camera experiment for twenty double V-notched specimens, and obtained 
reliable displacement field data of each specimen for notch-SIF computation. 
These completed works have met the research goals set by the applicant in the project 
proposal.  In additions, the acceptable errors of the notch-SIF results for the tested specimens 
in Table 3 show that the proposed CCD camera experiment combined with the DIC method and 
the least-squares method provides a useful tool to determine the notch stress intensity factors for 
any notched joints where the William’s series solution for the displacement fields near the 
V-notch tip is valid..  Two journal papers from the results of this research are expected to 
submit to international journals.
