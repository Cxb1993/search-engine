2.1 System Architecture 
The two-layered architecture of the proposed facial 
expression recognition system is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
Action units are first extracted from facial images in the 
Feature Extraction Layer by using Support Vector 
Machines. The extracted Action units are then feed 
forward into the Facial Expression Recognition Layer 
which employs type-2 fuzzy logic in the decision making 
process.

2.2 Type-2 Fuzzy Logic 
According to Mendel’s propositions in [9], type-2 
fuzzy sets are briefly described as follows. Firstly, A is a 
type-1 fuzzy set and the membership grade of Xx∈  in 
A is )(xAμ , which is a crisp number in [0,1]; moreover, a 
type-2 fuzzy set in X is A~  and the membership grade of 
Xx∈  in A~  is )(~ xAμ , which is a type-1 fuzzy set in 
[0,1]. The type-2 fuzzy set A~  can be represented as 
}|))(,{(~ ~
A
XxxxA ∈∀= μ  
or 
]1,0[ ,]/)([/)(~ ~
A
⊆== ∫ ∫∫
∈ ∈∈

Xx Ju
x
Xx
JxuufxxA
X
μ  
where Jx is the primary membership of x, u is primary 
membership function (MF), and )(uf x  is secondary 
membership function.  
The useful type-2 fuzzy set is the footprint of uncertainty 
(FOU) [6]-[9]. It is the union of all primary membership, 
i.e., 
FOU( A% ) = 
x X∈
U  Jx 
Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the Gaussian primary MF with 
uncertain mean and Gaussian primary MF with uncertain 
standard deviation. These definitions are constructed on 
the antecedent and consequent parts in our proposed 
type-2 FLSs. Herein, these MFs with uncertain mean and 
standard deviation are

respectively. Obviously, this primary membership can be 
represented as bounded intervals by upper MF and lower 
MF, denote as )(~ xAμ  and )(~ xAμ , respectively. Details 
about type-2 fuzzy sets can be found in [11].

When type-2 fuzzy input set xA
~
 only contains a single 
element x′ , xA~  is a type-2 fuzzy singleton that is 
following as:

The output of the inference engine in our system must 
be processed next by the output processor and the first 
operation is type-reduction. The method is adopted by 
center-of-sets type-reduction [11]. In order to convenient 
for compute, the interval type-2 fuzzy sets will be 
adopted in this thesis. Therefore, the center-of-set 
defuzzification for the output is expressed by

associated with Ly , denoted by 
l
Ly . The values of 
ly  
is associated with Ry , denoted by

Support Vector Machines non-linearly map their 
n-dimensional input space into a high dimensional feature 
space. In this high dimensional feature space a linear 
classifier is constructed. Support vector machine, as a 
novel approach in pattern recognition, has demonstrated a 
success in applications such as face detection, face 
recognition, and the detection of action units in this 
project. Due to the employing of kernel functions, 
support vector machines have good generality capability. 
This capability makes support vector machines suitable 
for the adaptive detection of action units. 
Most of the fuzzy-based facial recognition systems are 
implemented with type-1 FLSs. The type-2 FLSs can 
cope with the uncertain operation beyond the type-1 
FLSs. However, a general type-2 FLS is too complicated 
due to calculate the meet operation for the each fired rule, 
especially when product t-norm in our system. We have 
no rational basis for choosing secondary membership 
functions [9]. Since the values of all possibility 
embedded type-2 fuzzy sets are computed in the 
defuzzify process, the performance of the type-2 FLS is 
very complex. To improve performance of the type-2 
FLS, the type-reduction methods can be chosen in the 
type-2 FLSs. In this project, we implement a modified 
center-of-sets type-reduction method in our system. 
The proposed facial expression recognition system 
combines both the generality capability of support vector 
machines and the ability to cope with uncertain operation 
of type-2 fuzzy logic. The robustness and adativeness are 
well enhanced under such system design.
