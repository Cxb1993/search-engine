3.  Ghost cell Treatmetn for Dirichlet  and 
Neumann Boundary Conditions 
In 2D, the immersed surface boundary is 
specified by a set of linear line segments whose 
nodes lie on the solid body surface, as shown in 
Fig. 1.  All cells with their center covered by 
the immersed body are body cells.  All cells 
with their center immersed in the fluid are fluid 
cells.  The body cells neighboring to at least 
one fluid cell are ghost cells.  It is clear that 
the immersed boundary surface lies in the space 
between the ghost cells and their neighboring 
fluid cells.  All fluid cells are computed by 
Eqs. (4) to (6).  The ghost cells, being the first 
layer of cells external to the fluid domain, are 
used to supply appropriate boundary conditions 
for the computation of fluid cells.  All body 
cells are assumed known with a divergence-free 
velocity distribution inside the body.  Under 
this assumption, the pressure field inside the 
body satisfies the same governing equation as 
outside, and Eq. (6) can be applied to the entire 
grid domain regardless of the cell type.  
For Dirichlet boundary conditions, a 
2-point stencil reconstruction model based on 
the ghost cell’s projection point and image 
point is developed in Pan and Shen [4].  For a 
ghost cell center, its projection point on the 
boundary surface is the point where the 
Dirichlet boundary condition is to be enforced.  
Along the surface normal direction passing 
through the projection point, the image point of 
a ghost cell is at a fixed normal distance δ  
into the flow domain, as shown in Fig. 1.  The 
choice of δ  is arbitrary, here we take 
minx∆= 2δ  in 2D and minx∆= 3δ  in 3D 
problems, where minx∆  is the minimum 
Cartesian cell length in the mesh.  This chosen 
δ  ensures that the image point is enclosed by 
four (eight in 3D) fluid cell centers forming a 
square (cubic in 3D) contour close to but 
untouched by the body surface.  The variable 
at the image point imageQ  can be obtained by a 
bi-linear interpolation using the center values 
enclosing the image point.  With the given 
Dirichlet boundary value projQ , the ghost cell 
values can be extrapolated as 
projghost
projimage
projghost rr
QQ
QQ vv −−−= δ  (13) 
where ghostr
v  and projr
v  are the position vector 
of the ghost center and the projection point, 
respectively.  The ghost cell variable ghostQ  
in Eq. (13) implicitly satisfies the Dirichlet 
boundary condition at the projection point on 
the immersed surface.   
The linear reconstruction model described 
above is quite simple, and can be applied to 3D 
problems in a straightforward manner.  The 
simplicity of the model is attributed to the 
choice of a constant normal distance δ  for all 
image points.  If we choose a shorter δ , the 
stencil for the interpolation of imageQ  will vary, 
making the scheme complicate.  If we choose 
a longer δ , the flow reconstruction in Eq. (13) 
will be inaccurate for the flow in the vicinity of 
the immersed boundary.  Furthermore, the 
current choice of δ  ensures that 
projghost rr
vv −>δ  in Eq. (13), and thus avoids 
the unstable situation when some stencil point 
gets too close to the boundary surface. 
In the case of Neumann boundary condition 
with a given normal gradient proj)n
Q( ∂
∂  at the 
projection point, a simple extrapolation to 
6 
 
pressure and temperature on various grids are 
plotted against cell lengths in Fig. 3.  For 
convenience, curves showing first-order and 
second-order convergences are also shown in 
the figure.  It is obvious that the spatial 
accuracy of the current method for Dirichlet 
conditions is second order in maximum norms 
on all indicated variables.  Although not 
shown here, 1L  and 2L  norms on these 
variables are also second-order accurate. 
For an isoflux cylinder with Neumann 
boundary condition for temperature on the 
cylinder, Fig 4 shows 1L , 2L  and maximum 
norms of temperature error on various grids.  
The 1L  norm and 2L  norm in the figure are 
obviously second-order accurate.  The 
maximum norm has an average order about 
1.44, which is less than second order.  This 
result is considered satisfactory, because if the 
simple ghost cell treatment of Eq. (14) for 
isoflux cylinder has been adapted, the average 
slope for all three norms in temperature error 
would be roughly one.  Thus, Fig. 3b has 
indicated the gain in solution accuracy when Eq. 
(15) is adapted for Neumann boundary 
condition. 
8. Forced Convection Over A Cylinder 
The steady and unsteady flows over a 
circular cylinder of diameter D=1 at Re=10, 20, 
40, 100, 120 and 200 are computed on a 
Cartesian grid with local refinement.  The 
outer boundaries are 30 diameters away from 
the cylinder.  The grid is locally refined 
around the cylinder to have 384 ghost cells and 
620 ghost vertices, while the total number of 
terminal cells is only 31120.  This high grid 
resolution around the cylinder is used here only 
to demonstrate the advantage of local 
refinement, because it is almost impossible to 
obtain such a high grid resolution on a regular 
Cartesian over the same computational domain.  
The free stream condition is set to the inflow 
boundary and the two side boundaries.  The 
downstream boundary uses the upwind 
differenced equation of 
0=∂∂+∂∂ )x/Q(U)t/Q( n , where nU  is the 
computed normal outflow velocity at the 
boundary.  The free stream temperature is 
0=∞θ . 
For both the isothermal and the isoflux 
cylinders, the local Nusselt number on cylinder 
surface is defined as HD/k, where H is the local 
heat transfer coefficient, k is the thermal 
conductivity.  For an isothermal cylinder with 
a cylinder temperature 1=cylθ , the local 
Nusselt number on the cylinder is

the local Nusselt number on the cylinder is

1= .  The averaged Nusselt number 
over the cylinder is computed by  
∑∑ ∆∆= surface local
surface
avg SNuS
Nu 1  (20) 
where the summation is done on all boundary 
surface segments of the body.   
For the steady cases of Re=10, 20 and 40, 
the Euler implicit method is used with a time 
step 50.t =∆ .  This amounts to a maximum 
CFL number around 20 in the steady state, and 
it may exceed 80 in transient.  For such high 
CFL numbers, the implicit time integration and 
multigrid methods described above are 
essential for the stability of the solution process.  
For convenience, one multigrid V cycle going 
through the coarse grids is counted as 
equivalent to one ALU relaxation step on the 
finest grid.  The typical convergence history 
for steady state computations is shown in Fig. 5, 
taking Re=20 case as an example.  The 
maximum norms of the steady state residual of 
the fluid cells have dropped 4 orders of 
magnitude in less than 500 steps.  The 
temperature residual settles down at round 
1000 steps.  The computed streamlines for 
Re=20 case are plotted in Fig. 6.  The 
streamlines around the cylinder are smooth, 
indicating that the ghost cell treatment has 
captured the immersed boundary on the refined 
Cartesian grid.  Figure 7 shows the computed 
pressure coefficient contours.  The pressure 
inside the cylinder adjusts itself automatically 
to the pressure field outside.  The pressure 
contours intersect the cylinder wall in a nearly 
orthogonal manner.  The pressure coefficient 
on the immersed boundary segment center can
