Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) is a
digital radio transmission system (DRTS) for
sending multimedia (radio, TV, and datacasting)
to mobile devices. It can be operated by satellite
(S-DMB) or terrestrial (T-DMB) transmission as
shown in Table 4. Broadcasting and multicasting
offer a significant improvement of spectrum
utilization. DMB is based on the standard of
Eureka 147 Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB).
T-DMB stands for Terrestrial - Digital
Multimedia Broadcasting. DMB is based on the
standard of Eureka 147 DAB system that is
widely deployed in the UK and many other
countries.

MediaFLO is Qualcomm's new technology to
broadcast data in portable devices such as cell
phones and PDAs. Table 5 illustrates the
operation frequency of the MediaFLO system
technique. In the United States, the MediaFLO
system will use the frequency spectrum at
approximate 700MHz, which is previously
allocated to UHF TV Channel 55. MediaFLO
transforms multimedia delivery and opens
market opportunities for the entire mobile value
chain including wireless operators. MediaFLO
also uses time division multiplexing technique.
This allows the receiver to be shut down in
between these intervals to save power.
The paper also compares MBMS to other
potential methods for mobile mass
communications such as DVB-H (Digital Video
Broadcast, Handheld) and discusses the role of
MBMS in the future. MBMS provides the
capability for Broadcasting and Multimedia
Services for the 3 GPP systems. MBMS is a
point-to-multipoint service that means data is
transmitted from a single source entity to
multiple recipients. MBMS allows network
resources to be shared. MBMS is part of the
WCDMA evolution standardized by 3GPP.
MBMS will be available both for GSM/EDGE
and WCDMA. Mobile TV services based on
MBMS are expected in 2008.

2. Antenna Design and Application
To create the characteristics of wideband, a
3-Dimension (3D) monopole antenna with the
configuration of parallel fed from one to four on
the same radiator is presented as shown in Fig.2
to Fig.4. With different kinds of structures of fed
of monopole antenna, the good characteristics of
wideband is conducted from 370 MHz to 1000
MHz referring to -5 dB return loss. By referring
to the reference [11], the impedance bandwidth
and return loss of antenna can be controlled. On
the other hand, the 3D monopole antenna with
conductive material and the structure of parallel
multi-fed can be integrated together. The
proposing structure of fed consists of
multi-probe with the method of parallel on the
same radiator. Another characteristics of
monopole radiator, low-Q, can be conducted by
using this radiator element.
The total length of 3D monopole antenna, W
+ H + L, is 60ÔÅ¨ at center frequency as shown
in Fig. 4 to 6. With the configuration of
monopole antenna with conductive material, the
electrical performances of radiator in different
positions of fed will be compared as shown in
Fig. 8 to 15. With the geometry of monopole
element, the good electric characteristics of
wideband have been achieved from 470 MHz to
770 MHz (DVB-H bands) and Media-FLO
(700MHz) band.
