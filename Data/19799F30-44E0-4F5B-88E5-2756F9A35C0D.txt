一、中文摘要
本計畫探討連桿組的運動範圍的解
析。主要區分為兩部份；第一部份針對雙
構形連桿組，第二部份探討如六連桿或八
連桿之極限位置。
第一部份: 本文對於雙構形連桿組，解析
其運動範圍及類型判別式。雙構形連桿組
為對於一指定之輸入角可得兩個輸出角之
解﹔且反之亦然。由於將所有具兩種構形
的連桿組，視為單一個課題加以解析，因
此其結果可適用於眾多雙構形連桿組。首
先由通用的輸出入方程式，推導出二次曲
線。基於二次曲線與單位圓的交點及其對
應的梯度值，能迅速求得可運動範圍。若
二次曲線之一軸線與座標軸重疊，則視為
特定群組。對該群組，藉由將二次曲線轉
化為拋物線並進行詳細解析，則推得含二
組不等式的簡要判別式，可用以判別該群
組的所有連桿組的類型。另外對於部分接
頭為稜柱運動對之連桿組亦予以探討。文
中探討連桿組包含 RPSPR、 RPSC、 RSSR
及 RSSP 等。
第二部份: ㄧ個 Assur 五連桿組最多有六
個構形。當其中有兩個構形相同時，則稱
為雙重構形。若將 Assur 五連桿拆解為具
一個自由度之四連桿組及雙頭桿作分析，
雙重構形發生之特徵為耦桿點曲線的梯度
向量平行於雙頭桿方向。藉此特徵可推得
相關方程並求得拆解點座標。由於具雙重
構形之 Assur 五連桿組與位於極限位置的
六連桿組有對等關係，因此對五連桿組之
桿長或樞點座標做分析，可藉以求得六連
桿組的極限位置。基於 Bezout 數、圓心點
和重點等特性，可知六連桿組最多有 24 個
極限位置。對於具稜柱運動對之連桿組亦
予以探討。此概念亦可應用八連桿。

Abstract
This project investigated the analysis of
mobility region for linkages. It can be divided
into two parts. The first part focused on
bimodal linkages. The other part focused on
the complicated planar linkage, such as
six-bar and eight-bar.
1st Part : The mobility region and type
determination criteria for bimodal linkages
are discussed. A bimodal linkage has two
potential output angles for any given input
angle, and vice versa. The analysis treats all
bimodal linkages as a common problem and
the results are thus general and applicable to
lots of mechanisms. A conic curve is derived
from the general input-output equation of
bimodal linkages. The mobility regions of a
concerned link are attained from the
intersection points as well as the
corresponding differentiation between this
conic curve and unit circle. The linkages with
one axis of conic curve being coincident with
the coordinate axes are classified as a
selective group. The conic curve is converted
into a parabola to delicately derive the
concise criteria that consist of two groups of
inequalities and are applicable to determine
the type efficiently for all linkages belonging
to this group. The linkages with prismatic
output are also considered. All RPSPR,
RPSC, RSSR, and RSSP linkages are
discussed.
2nd part: A five-link Assur Kinematic
Chain (AKC) has six configurations at most.
If two of them are identical, they are defined
as double configurations. The five-link AKC
is dismantled into a four-bar and a binary link
for analyzing the double configurations. The

Two steps are proposed to find the
mobility region for angle  where
 01  is satisfied. Firstly, the limiting
angles lim satisfying   0lim1  are to
be found. As shown in Figure 1, lim , such
as 1lim and 2lim , are the intersection
points between the conic curve  01 
and a unit circle after setting cosX and
sinY . Besides, combining a conic curve
and a circle can lead to a quartic equation and
there are four real solutions at most for lim .
The second step is to find the signs of
 d/d 1 at the limiting angles lim by
using

If
1lim
|d/d 1  , as shown in Figure 1, is
positive, this implies the linkage can be
assembled at  1lim since
  01lim1  . The term  represents
a small variation of . Similarly, the linkage
can be assembled at  2lim if
0|d/d
2lim1   .
Based on the solved values of lim and
signs of
lim
|d/d 1  , the mobility region,
such as the arc drawn by bold line, of the
input link can be determined. The sign of 1
is always positive or negative if there is no
real solution for lim . The input link is a
crank for 01 , and the linkage cannot
even be assembled if 01 . The sign of
1 can be verified by various simple tests,
such as checking the sign of
6411 CCC  at o0 .
When the mobility region of the output
link is considered, Equation (1) can be
rewritten as

  24Q4PPPQ2X 2222  
(18)
The parabola doesn’t intersect with the unit
circle or the variable X has no real roots if
04Q4PT 21  or
  04Q4PPPQ2T 2222  .
Besides, the satisfaction of Equations (14)
implies 0QPT 223  and 0Q . All
these constraints are shown in Figure 4.
Meanwhile, two significant features that
should be noted. One is that is both
04Q4PT 21  and 0QPT 223 
are tangent to each other at points (2, 2) and
(-2, 2). The other feature is that both 0T2 
and 0T3  are coincident at 2QP  .
As a result, the region 0Q can be divided
into four different regions for analyzing as
follws.
Regions I: This regions imply 0QP 
and 0T3  , and Equations (14) can’t be
satisfied.
Region II: This region stands for
04Q4PT 21  . Since the variable X
has no real roots and 0T3  , the results as
shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) can be
expected and the link considered can make
fully rotation.
Region III: This region is bounded by
0QPT 223  , 04Q4PT 21  and
2Q . Since 0T2 is satisfied, the link
can be a crank.
Region IV: This region is bounded by
0QPT 223  , 04Q4PT 21  and
Q<2. However, the variable X has real
solutions due to 0T2  .
Accordingly, the regions for the existence
of crank locate at regions II and III, and the
additional constraint is just one of the
following

Meanwhile, each inequality of Equations (19)
is the sufficient condition. The union of
Equations (19-1) and (19-2) or (19-1) and
(19-3) becomes the sufficient and necessary
condition. On the other hand, although
Equation (10') can be derived so that only
variable Y is included, the relationship
between all three Equations (19) is not
explicit and Equation (19-3) can't be attained.
The flowchart in Figure 5 is proposed to
determine the type of the concerned link for
0CC 43  . This strategy remains
applicable for 0CC 53  after swapping
1C with 2C and replacing 5C by 4C .

The case 0C3  implies two axes of the
conic curve being parallel to X-axis and
Y-axis. If similar technique as in Equation
(16) is applied, the parabola equation
becomes   QPYRX 2  and has three
parameters. Hence, the analysis as in Figure 4
cannot be followed since a tedious
three-dimension problem will be met up.
Although several sufficient conditions for the
existence of crank might be attained as in [5],

Example 1: The parameters of an RPSPR
linkage are listed as: 1a =5,
o
1 60 ,
8SX  , 4SY  , 8b1 , o1 25 , 3Sx  ,
2Sy  , f=25, g=10, h=8, and o20 .
Sol: None of the coefficients in Equation (1)
or (6) are zero for a general RPSPR, and
concise criteria do not exist. The mobility
regions are determined numerically.
Step 1: Use Equations (25) to calculate all
nine coefficients appeared in Equation (1).
Step 2: Regarding the input link, calculate
iC and derive the equation  01  by
following Equations (6). By combining
 01  and unit circle, all lim are
found as 66.7322 (-), 95.6806 (+), 205.1123
(-), and 339.6900 (+). Meanwhile, (+) and (-)
represent the signs of
lim
|dd 1  . The
mobility regions are then 95.6806
~205.1123 and -20.3100~66.7322.
Step 3: For the output link, calculate iCˆ by
following Equations (9). It is a crank since
there is no real solution for 02  and
2 is always positive.
Step 4: The type of the linkage is a
double-rocker and it becomes a
crank-rocker if input link and output link
are swapped.
Regarding the special case 01 and
0SY  discussed in [5], 0C3  and the
axes of the conic curve are parallel to X-axis
and Y-axis. Only sufficient conditions for the
existence of full rotation link can be attained
in addition to complicated quartic
discriminants.
The linkage becomes an RPSC if both 2P
and 2R axes are coincident, and parameters
1b , 1, and yS are all zero. Regarding a
special case that both input and output axes
are parallel or 0 , the coefficients B, C, D,
F, G, 3C , 4C , 3Cˆ , and 4Cˆ are all zero.
Because   0sinfCC 2121  , the
criteria for input link being a crank are just
Equations (14) and are
     0Saf2SafS X12X122x 
     0Saf2SafS X12X122x 
Both inequalities can be combined to get a
criterion X1x SafS  . Similarly, the
output link can make fully rotation if either
X1x SafS  or X1x SaSf  is
satisfied.
The RSSR linkage is then analyzed. The
lengths of input, coupler, and output links are
defined as a, b, and c. The derivation as for
the RPSPR linkage can be followed to derive
the input-output equation. Some coefficients
in Equation (6) are listed as
  222221 sinhcosba4C  2222 fba4C 
 sinfha8C 23
 Isinah2sincosgab42C 24   Iaf2fab42C 25  (26)
If a planar four-bar is considered, the
values of g, h, , 3C , and 4C are all zero.
Both Equations (14-1) and (14-2) that are the
criteria for the input link being a crank
become
0f)cb-(a
f)c-bf)(acbf)(-acb(a


9/18
the quartic discriminants have to be applied
to derive the criteria for type determination.
For the special case 0g , 0sin  , or
0cos  , Equations (14) are again the
criteria for the input link since 0CC 43 
and 21 CC  . Meanwhile, the coefficients of
both terms h and 3h in Equation (31) are
zero for 0g and 0cos  , and the
criteria for the prismatic joint is easy to
analyze. For the other special case 0f  , the
conic equation becomes
0CXCXC 64
2
1  (33)
The flowchart in Figure 5 is applicable by
swapping 1C with 2C and replacing 5C
by 4C . In other words, Equations (14) are
modified as
0CCC 461  and
0CCC 461  (34)
and parameters P and Q in Equations (19)
become
14 CCP and   161 CCCQ  (35)
Four concerned linkages and corresponding
concise criteria are also listed in Table 1.
2.6 Conclusion
For any bimodal linkages of which the
input-output equation can be formulated as
Equation (1) or (28), the limiting positions
are found by solving a conic curve and a unit
circle as proposed in Section 2. The mobility
regions can then be figured out efficiently by
considering the signs of the first
differentiation at limiting positions even
when the general RPSPR linkage is
considered.
The concise criteria to determine the type
for a selective group of bimodal linkages
have been derived. The feature of this group
is clearly defined as one axis of the derived
conic curve is coincident with coordinate
axes. Whether a considered linkage belongs
to this selective group can be judged easily
from the coefficients of input-output equation.
The concise criteria are just Equations (14)
and (19) derived in Section 3. In addition to
well-known planar and spherical four-bar, at
least eight linkages belonging to the selective
group are found in this article. The
corresponding type determination criteria are
all listed in Table 1. Moreover, this selective
group can be further divided into two
subgroups. The criteria for one subgroup are
only the satisfaction of Equations (14-1) and
(14-2), while at least one of Equations (19-1),
(19-2), and (19-3) has to be satisfied as well
for the other subgroup. Besides, the proposed
concise criteria can be treated as genelized
Grashof's rule.
The results in Section 2, Equations (14),
and (19) can be integrated to develop helpful
program for linkage design. For a concerned
bimodal linkage, the input-output equation
can be derived by following the techniques
illustrated in Section 4 for RPSPR and RSSR
linkages. Thereafter, the program can
numerically figure out the mobility regions.
Furthermore, the type determination criteria
can be derived symbolically and effectively if
the linkage belongs to the selective group.

The order of Equation (1) is 6 and it has
circularity 3 [11, 12]. The characteristics of
an equation are denoted by curly bracket {p,
q} in this article if it is of order p and has
circularity q. The characteristics of coupler
curve equation generated by an RRRR
four-bar are thus represented as {6, 3}. The
derivation of Equation (1) is a well-known
topic [13, 14], and the characteristics of other
coupler curves with prismatic joints within
the four-bar are also listed in Table 1.
The characteristics of equations can be
used to figure out the number of solutions
efficiently. For example, the point C must lie
on the intersection points between the
coupler curve generated by four-bar
00ABBA and a circle of which center and
radius are 0C and CC0 . The
characteristics of a circle are {2, 1}. The
maximum number of solutions by combining
coupler curve equation and the circle is
1226  according to Bezout number [15].
However, the circularity of coupler curve is 3
and that of circle is 1, and both curves
intersect at the circular points [11, 12], I(1, i,
0) and J(1, -i, 0), 6 times ( 132  =6). Hence,
the joint C has as many as 6, 12-6=6,
solutions in the real plane.
3.4 Length of binary link C0C
The first task to be discussed is to find
the specific lengths for link CC0 so that a
five-link AKC has double configurations. As
in previous Section, the dimensions of
constituent four-bar 00ABBA and link
ABC are all given. The coordinate of
point 0C is given as  v,uC0 . The
unknown coordinate of point C is assumed as
 y,xC . Since  y,xC is on the coupler
curve, Equation (1) must be satisfied. Besides,
the coupler curve and circle, of which center
and radius are 0C and CC0 , are tangential
to each other at point  y,xC . Therefore, the
gradient vectors of both curves are parallel,
and can be related as
  vyuxF
F

The terms xF and yF denote the partial
differentiation of coupler curve function F
with respect to variables x and y. They can be
expressed as

Where ixG or iyG represents the partial
differentiation of function iG , described in
Equation (2), with respect to x or y. The
characteristics of both functions xF and yF
are thus {5, 2}.
The coordinates of tangential point
 y,xC can be found by combining
Equations (1) and (3). The characteristics of
Equation (3) remain {5, 2} after substituting
Equations (4) and (5). The number of real
solutions for point C is thus
1823256  at most. Besides, the
feature of double points is 0FF yx  [11,
13]. Both curves described by Equations (1)
and (3) intersect at each double point twice.
Accordingly, six of 18 solutions are relevant
to three double points, and there are only as
many as 12 nontrivial solutions.
Two numerical examples are given for
illustration. The first example considers the
double configuration of five-link AKC. The
stationary configurations of Stephenson
six-bar with similar data are discussed in the
second example.

and C varies between 0.56 and 1.84.
All solutions of CC0 listed in
Table 2 are within this range.
Totally twelve or six pairs of lim
can be found and listed in Table 2.
The plot of angles  versus  is
illustrated in Figure 5(b). Similarly,
six intersection points are related to
three double points.
(c). The value of CC0 varies
between 1.25 and 1.75. None of
nontrivial solutions is within this
range. Hence, there is no limiting
value for  and the link DC is a
crank. Figure 5(c) shows the plot of
angles  versus  . Two
intersection points are related to
double point when 1.5270CC0  .
3.5 C0 on a circle
The length cCC0  is assigned for the
second task. The fixed pivot 0C with
unknown coordinate  
00 CC0 y,xC to be
found is assumed on a designated circle and
    22C2C rvyux 00  (6)
The parameters u, v, and r are all given
constants. If the five-link AKC has double
configurations, the vector CC0 is parallel to
 yx F,F that is the gradient vector of coupler
curve. Since cCC0  , a vector equation
relating the terms 0CC , xF , and yF can be
written as
  

(7)
The sign  appears since the directions of
0CC and  yx F,F can be either the same or
opposite. By substituting
0Cx and 0Cy as
expressed in Equation (7) into Equation (6)
and taking square on the resultant equation,
this leads to

The characteristics of 2y
2
x FF  are thus
{10, 5}, and those of Equation (8) are {14,
7}.
The coordinates of point  y,xC are
found by combining Equations (1) and (8).
The solutions of point  y,xC thus remain
the same if the term 2y
2
x FF  in Equations
(8) and (9) is substituted by
  3212y2x HF3HHFF  (11)
The characteristics of 2H are {6, 3}, but
those of  F3H2  reduce to {4, 2}. The
characteristics of both 2y
2
x FF  and
Equation (8) can thus be treated as {8, 4} and
{12, 6}, respectively. Therefore, the number
of solutions for point C is 36632126 
at most. Besides, each double point is
counted as four trivial solutions since both
15/18
The order of Equation (14) is 10 with
circularity as 4. The maximum number of
solutions is 36  36432106  when
combined with Equation (1). Meanwhile, 12
solutions are relevant to the double points,
and there are 24 nontrivial solutions at most.
The application is to find the limiting
positions of the slider when joint D in Figure
7(a) becomes prismatic.
The other task is not related to the
five-link AKC explicitly. The object is to
find lim within the six-bar shown in Figure
7(b). The joint 0C is prismatic and
o90DOC . The vector OC must be
tangential to the coupler curve when the link
DO is at the limiting position. Hence, both
vectors  yx F,F and DO are parallel. Let
the fixed pivot be  v,uD and rDO  .
Regarding the right triangle DOC , the
projection length of the vector DC on the
vector DO equals r. Therefore, the
coordinate  y,xC at the stationary
configurations must satisfy
     rFFF,Fv-y,ux 2y2xyx 
or
     2y2x22yx FFrv-yFuxF 
(15)
The characteristics are {12, 6}. The number
of solutions is 36 when combined with
Equation (1), and 12 of them are relevant to
three double points. Hence, the maximum
number of stationary configurations is also
24. If the offset DO equals zero, the
characteristics of Equation (15) are {6, 3}
and the maximum number of solutions
reduces to 18. On the other hand, the results
of this task can be applied to find lim
within the six-bar shown in Figure 3(b).
The foregoing four tasks are analyzed for
the four-bar 00ABBA having only revolute
joints. If some joints become prismatic,
Equation (3), (8), (14), or (15) can be derived
similarly from the corresponding coupler
curve equation listed in Table 1. Thereafter,
the results can be applied to find the
stationary configurations of lots of
Stephenson six-bar that are analogous to the
linkages shown in Figures 3 and 7.
3.7 Conclusion
By combining the four-bar coupler curve
and a specific equation, the lengths of a link
or coordinates of a fixed pivot are found so
that a five-link AKC has double
configurations. Four different tasks are
discussed. The results are applied to find the
stationary configurations of Stephenson II
and III six-bar shown in Figures 3 and 7.
Moreover, the maximum numbers of limiting
positions for three concerned links are all 24.
Whether the limiting joint angle at each
stationary configuration is a local minimum
or maximum can be judged easily with the
aid of the instantaneous center between two
ternary links. Although only five-link AKC
and six-bar are focused in this article, the
proposed techniques are applicable to
seven-link AKC and eight-bar with the aid of
six-bar coupler curve.
