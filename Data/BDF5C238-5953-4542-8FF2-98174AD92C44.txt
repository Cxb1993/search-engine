June 17 -21, Besançon, FRANCE 
The 12th World Congress in Mechanism and Machine 
Science 
The congress is organized by the French committee:  
E-mail: Conference secretariat (to be contacted for all matter related to the Conference)
After receiving several requests from National Committees, individuals and considering that 
some conferences related to Mechanisms and Machines Science were close to the deadline of 
the next IFToMM World Congress, the Organization Committee of IFToMM 2007 World 
Congress has decided, with the agreement of the IFToMM Executive Council, to postpone the 
deadline for the submission of papers to the IFToMM 2007 World Congress. The new, hard 
deadline is fixed on: 
SEPTEMBER 29, midnight, Paris local time.  
The Organization Committee want to mention that the current submission rate is quite 
satisfactory and that the postponement of the deadline is only a matter of convenience for the 
authors and will not result in a larger number of papers being accepted for the World 
Congress. 
Submission: all authors should receive a confirmation email after submitting their paper 
(please check carefully the email you give when submitting a paper). The manual check 
performed on the submitted files induces a delay (which is larger for Word files than for PDF) 
but if you have not received a confirmation email after a few days please contact the 
Secretariat.  
Paper verification: all submitted papers are checked to determine if they respect the desired 
paper format and are readable (especially pdf files that MUST EMBED all fonts). If you 
receive an email whose subject start with BAD followed by the problem and the paper 
number, please correct as soon as possible the problem and upload a new version. Paper that 
will not be in the correct format and cannot be read by external reviewers will not be accepted

II. Dynamic Model for a Spur Gear Pair 
 An engaged spur gear pair is shown in Fig. 1, in which 
T1  and 2T  denote the input and output torque respectively. 
The radii of the base circles of the engaged gear pair are 
Rb1  and Rb2 , respectively. The dynamic contact loads at 
the contact points A  and B   are PA  and PB . The radii of 
curvatures at the mating points are Rc
i
1  and Rc
i
2  ( i A B= , ) 
for gears 1 and 2, respectively. The instantaneous 
coefficients of friction at the contact points are µ A  and 
µ B . The angular displacements of gear 1 and gear 2 are 
denoted by θ 1  and θ 2 . The equations of motion for gears 
1 and 2 can be written as 
1 1 11 1 1  ( )

2 2 22 2 2  ( )  
A B
b A B c A A c B BJ R P P T R P R Pθ µ µ= + − ± ∓ , (2) 
where J1  and J2  are the polar moments of inertia of 
gears 1 and 2, respectively. Along the line of action, the 
displacements of gears 1, 2 are 
δ θ1 1 1= Rb  (3) δ θ2 2 2= Rb  (4) 
Therefore, the relative displacement between the two 
gears can be written as: 
δ θ θr b bR R= −1 21 2  (5) 
The effective masses of the two engaging gears are 
M J Rb1 1 1
2= /  (6) 
M J Rb2 2 2
2= /  (7) 
Consider that 
Aε  and ε B  are the composite profile 
deviations at the mating points A and B. The dynamic 
loads at contact points A and B can be calculated using the 
following: 
P KA A r A  ( )= −δ ε  (8) 
P KB B r B  ( )= −δ ε  (9) 
It is assumed that the dynamic alternation of output torque 
T2  is so small that 
1 1 2 2/ /b bT R T R≈  (10) 
The converted equation of motion with relative 
displacement δ r  can be derived as

where P0  is the reference load or the steady load, 
P T Rb0 1 1=  / . The effect of the damping force is 
incorporated into the dynamic load calculation by 
introducing a viscous damping force 2ζ ω δn r . Under 
this assumption, the converted equation of motion can be 
rewritten as: 
 δ ζ ω δ ω δ ξr n r n r r+ + =2 2  (12) 
The magnitude of damping ratio ζ  depends upon the 
lubrication film between the contacting teeth, and a value 
between 0.1 and 0.2 suggested by Hirano [23] and 
Ishikawa [24], for obtaining the correlation between their 
analytical and experimental results. In this study, however, 
a constant value of 0.17 for the damping ratio ζ , as 
proposed by Arikan [20], was used for analysis. 
The transmitted dynamic torque Tr , introduced by the 
dynamic loads PA  and PB  on gear 2, can be 
approximated as 
T P P Rr A B b= +( ) 2  (13) 
 
III. Parameters for the Dynamic Equation 
A. Position dependent mesh stiffness 
The mesh stiffness between an engaged gear pair consists 
of two parts; one associated with the local Hertzian 
deformation and the other associated with the tooth 
bending deflection. The unit width Hertzian stiffness Kh  
resulting from the tooth surface contact was first 
approximated by Yang [18] as: 
2/ 4 (1 )hK Eπ ν⎡ ⎤= −⎣ ⎦  (14) 
where E  is Young's module and ν  is the Poisson's ratio. 
It was noticed that the unit width Hertzian stiffness is 
related only to the gear material, and remains constant 
along the path of contact. 
Based upon the finite element analysis results, an equation 
for the calculation of single tooth bending stiffness for the 
addendum modified involute gear was proposed by Yang 
and Kuang [25]. The unit width stiffness K ri ( )   for a 
single tooth i at a loading position r can be approximated 
using the following equation: 
0 1 2 3( )  ( ) ( ) (1 )

−= + + + +  
(15) 
where the bending stiffness per unit tooth width K ri ( )   
is measured in N m / mm/ µ . Variables X i  and N i  
denote the addendum modification coefficient and the 
number of teeth of gear i. The radial distance r, radius of 
pitch circle Ri  and the module m in the Eq. (14) are

where N i , F  and ρ  are the tooth number, tooth face

The module m and the face width F in Eq. (26) are all 
measured in meters. The density ρ  and the inertia J are 
measured in ( kg / m3 ) and ( kg m 2⋅ ). 
 
D. Bending stress 
According Kuang and Yang [25], the bending stress at the 
contact points can be express as 
b f refKσ σ=  (28) 
where fK  and bσ  are the stress intensity factor and 
reference bending stress respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, 
the reference bending stress is defined at the highest point 
of single tooth contact point (HPSTC), and can be written 
as

E. Surface contact stress 
As shown in Fig. 3, the analytic model for surface contact 
stress proposed by Smith [27] is used. Let x, y, and z be 
the tangential, axial and raidal directions at the contact 
point. Assuming the plane strain case at the contact point, 
the stresses at xz plane can be written as

Fig. 4 shows the influenc of tooth number on the failure 
mode of the pinion. As the tooth number increases, the 
failures of the pinion will happen at high input torques.  It 
is found the pinion with tooth number under 29 fails due 
to  the surface failure. When the tooth number is geater 
than 29, the break failure dominates.  
Fig. 5 shows the  influence of profile shifted factor on the 
failure mode of the pinion. As the value of profile shifted 
factor 1X  increases, the input torque will also increase to 
cause surface failure. However, it has little effects on the 
break failure. Generally, the break failure will dominate 
for positive values of profile shifted factor 1X , and the 
surface failure for negative values. 
Fig. 6 shows the influenc of tooth hardness on the failure 
mode of the pinion. As the tooth hardness increases, the 
failures of the pinion will happen at high input torques. It 
is found the pinion with hardness under 270 fails due to  
the surface failure. When the tooth hardness is geater than 
270, the break failure dominates. 
VI. Conclusion 
In this study, the influence of gear parameters on the 
pinion life was discussed. When pinion with fewer tooth 
number, negative profile-shifted factor and lower tooth 
hardness, the surface failure mode dominated. On the 
contrary, the break failure happened at high values of 
tooth number and tooth hardness, and positive profile-
shifted factor.
