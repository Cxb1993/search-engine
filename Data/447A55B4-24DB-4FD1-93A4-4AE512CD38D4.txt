Abstract 
In this project, we have successfully synthesized different morphologies of 
polyaniline–manganese dioxide (PANI-MnO2) nanocomposites using interface 
reaction by controlling the KMnO4 and HCl concentrations in aqueous phase. 
Reaction mechanisms of PANI-MnO2 nanocomposites formation were proposed 
based on pH changes and phenomena occurred during synthesis. SEM, BEI, TEM 
and FTIR are used to verify the reaction mechanisms, which are PANI trapped the 
MnO2 nanoparticles at lower pH and MnO2 without PANI trapping at higher pH. 
Simultaneously, at constant acid pH, XRD confirmed that α-MnO2 was obtained, 
while β-MnO2 was obtained when the pH increased during the synthesis. Through 
investigation using cyclic voltammetric method, different morphologies of 
nanocomposites also generate different electrochemical behaviors that lead the 
nanocomposites to be potentially applied to wide different applications, which one 
of them is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensors. PANI-trapped MnO2 nanoparticles 
showed much higher current response, faster response time and better stability in the 
presence of H2O2 than MnO2 without PANI trapping. It has been suggested that 
PANI-trapped MnO2 nanoparticles was able to protect MnO2 from dissolving due to 
the decreasing of pH locally on the electrode surface. Hence, PANI-trapped MnO2 
nanoparticles also shows a sensitivity of 4.41 × 105 µA M-1 cm-2 and detection limit 
of 12 µM that can be compared to the other H2O2 sensor that applying MnO2-based 
electrodes.

Polyaniline (PANI) is attractive conducting polymers because of its high 
electrical conductivity, good environment stability, and ease to preparation.1 
Chemical synthesis that requires aniline monomers, an oxidant, and acidic medium 
has been known as the feasible route to produce PANI in large amount. Kaner, et 
al.2 introduced interfacial polymerization method, which is not depending on 
template or a specific complex chemical reagent, post-synthetic treatments. They 
reported that the polymerization in the interfacial polymerization occurs at the phase 
boundary of an immiscible aqueous/organic biphasic system. The polymers formed 
by this method are in nanofibers and the limitation of the interface does not allow 
these nanofibers to overgrowth with un-reacted monomer and initiator. However, 
PANI has poor mechanical properties because its aromatic structure, inter-chain 
hydrogen bonds, and effective charge delocalization in its structure.3 
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is one of the most attractive inorganic materials 
for catalytic and electrochemical applications because of its low cost, safety, 
environment friendliness and unique electrochemical properties.4,5 However, the use 
of MnO2 has been limited since it is unstable and undergoes a reductive-dissolution 
process when exposed to even mild acidic media, yielding water soluble Mn2+ 
species.6,7 In addition, unsupported MnO2 does not provide a large surface area, 
which results in poor catalytic activity. 
MnO2 is a commonly used oxidant for removing environmental hazards such 
as atrazine, which is one of most ubiquitous and dangereous pollutants. For example, 
Spiro et al.8 reported the degradation of atrazine catalyzed by δ-MnO2. Furthermore, 
recent studies have focused on the electrocatalytic activity of MnO2 towards the 
detection of ascorbic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) determination. Zhang 
et al.9 prepared a γ-MnO2 modified carbon electrode for electrochemically 
measurement of AA. The electrode had a linear response range of 1.0 × 10-6?4.0 × 
10-3 M with a detection limit of 6.0 × 10-7 M. Yao et al.10 found that MnO2 
nanoparticles exhibited a good sensitivity of 3.14 × 104 µA M-1 cm-2 to H2O2 upon 
homogeneous dispersion in colloidal Na-montmorillonite. Hu et al.11 reported that 
MnO2 nanoparticles, synthesized using a rheological phase reaction and dispersed in 
dihexadecyl hydrogen phosphate, showed a sensitivity of 2.66 × 105 µA M-1 cm-2 to 
H2O2. Zhang et al.12 reported that a glassy carbon electrode modified with a hybrid 
film of nafion and MnO2 microspheres achieved a H2O2 detection limit of 2.0 × 10-6 
M. The main aim of the above efforts on H2O2 electrooxidation was to uniformly 
disperse MnO2 to obtain large surface areas and, theorefore, better catalytic ability.

3-1. Synthesis 
Interfacial polymerization has been successfully synthesized nanostructure of 
PANI-MnO2 composite without using any templates, catalysts and other step of 
reaction. The synthesis are performed with aniline dissolved in chloroform to form 
organic phase at the bottom layer, and KMnO4 as the oxidant dissolved in HCl as 
aqueous phase at the upper layer. The monomer aniline and oxidant KMnO4 is 
separated initially by the boundary between the aqueous and organic phases creating 
an interface. Here, all the components required for the synthesis meet together.  
Aqueous solvent HCl gives the environment in acid, which is suitable to enhance the 
head-to-tail coupling between aniline monomers. On the other hand, permanganate 
ion MnO4- tends to reduce to MnO2 in slightly acid, neutral or alkaline solutions. 
Therefore, the pH value at the aqueous solution during 72 hours of the synthesis is 
important to estimate the ionization reaction of KMnO4 to MnO2 and the 
propagation of the aniline monomer become PANI. Fig. 1 represents the changes of 
pH during time of synthesis curve. 
As shown in the figure, initially, pH value was measured at pH 0.4 to 1 
according to the concentration of HCl applied. During several hours of synthesis, the 
pH was increased. At this time, MnO4- from KMnO4 firstly reduced to Mn2+ in the 
presence of H2O by following equation 1: 
    (1) 
Then, the pH value sharply dropped which we suggest to be the oxidation of ion 
Mn2+ to MnO2 followed by oxidation and propagation of aniline monomers were 
taking place. These reactions produced proton H+ that induced the pH to decrease. 
The reactions followed equation 2 and 3: 
   (2) 
   (3) 
Afterwards, the pH value started to increase with the increasing time of 
synthesis. During the synthesis, some amount of oxygen gas product was also 
 5
However, if the concentration of KMnO4 is higher (0.4 M) while the HCl 
concentration remains the same (1 M), the crystal structure of MnO2 obtained is 
β-MnO2. From Fig. 1(b), diffraction peaks and plane orientations are as follows: 28o 
(110), 37o (101), 41o (200), 43o (111), 50o (210), 56o (211), 61o (220), 65o (002), 67o 
(310) which are indicated that the MnO2 structure is in β-MnO2 (JCPDS PDF card 
no. 024-0735). 
At lower concentration of HCl, both of variation of KMnO4 concentration (0.1 
M and 0.4 M) show two broad peaks at 37o and 65o, which have plane structures of 
(101) and (002), indicates that MnO2 structures are both β-MnO2. These XRD 
patterns may be related to the low crystallization degree and the small size of the 
crystalline grain because of the PANI distortion in crystal structure of MnO2 during 
the synthesis, which led to transformation of the crystalline β-MnO2 into the 
amorphous phase. However, there is also the possibility of crystalline β-MnO2 
nanorods appeared.1 The morphologies observed from SEM, BEI and TEM images 
may confirm the phenomenon that will be discussed afterwards. 
3-3. Morphology characterization 
The morphologies of PANI-MnO2 are shown in Fig. 3, 4 and 5. The samples 
had first been purified by dialysis and centrifuge to achieve black product of 
PANI-MnO2. Interfacial polymerization is not able to control the separation of each 
material when the synthesis occurs. Thus, SEM and TEM are not able to recognize 
which one is PANI or MnO2. However, since Mn has larger atomic number (Ar = 
54.93), whereas Carbon, Nitrogen, and Hydrogen, the atom contained in PANI, have 
smaller atomic numbers than MnO2. Hence, the using of Back-scattering Electron 
Imaging, which the larger atomic number of element produces higher intensity in the 
image, would be representatively useful to predict the Mn distribution on the 
composite. 
The representative SEM and BEI images of PANI-MnO2 nanocomposite 
prepared by 0.1 M KMnO4 dissolved in 1 M HCl and 0.1 M HCl are shown in Fig. 3. 
At Fig. 3(1a), SEM image shows that the product of PANI-MnO2 prepared by 0.1 M 
KMnO4 dissolved in 1 M HCl consisted of fibers and spheres of agglomerated 
nanofibers. BEI image (Fig. 3(2a)) confirms that the nanoparticles attached on the 
fibers are MnO2. On the other hand, the observed fibers are PANI. These images 
also observe the presence of the spheres, which we suggest that they are the 
agglomerated nanofibers of PANI. We suggest that the spheres of agglomerated 
PANI were caused by the initial nucleation of MnO2 nanoparticles. In this sample, 
MnO2 was not easy to grow further because the concentration of KMnO4 is very 
small and MnO2 nanoparticulates have strong tendency to form agglomerates, while 
 7
the low crystalline degree in XRD pattern obtained from this product material (Fig. 
2(c, d)).  
KMnO4 concentration had affect on the amount of MnO2 produced. The 
smaller the ion MnO4- in the system, the smaller concentration of MnO2 produced 
(equation 1, 2 and 4). In Fig. 5(c, d), in the same HCl concentration, the amount of 
MnO2 nanorods produced by 0.4 M KMnO4 is larger. However, the product of 
PANI-MnO2 prepared from 0.1 M KMnO4 dissolved in 1 M HCl is an exception 
because in this synthetic condition, polymerization of aniline monomer to form 
polyaniline nanofibers is optimal which hinder the growth of MnO2 conducted by 
reaction in equation 4. 
3-4. FTIR analysis 
The FTIR spectra of PANI-MnO2 nanocomposite prepared from 0.1 M 
KMnO4 and 0.4 M KMnO4 each dissolved in 1 M and 0.1 M HCl are shown in Fig. 
6. Each of spectra reveals the characteristic adsorption peaks 3394cm-1 ( N-H 
stretching ), 1571-1592 cm-1 ( C=C stretching quinoid ), 1494-1502 cm-1 (C=C 
stretching benzenoid ), 1292-1294 cm-1 ( C-N stretching ), 1150-1170 cm-1 (C-H in 
plane bending ), 822-895 cm-1 (out of plane deformations of 1,4 di-substituted 
benzene rings ), 532-593 cm-1 (O-H stretching ), and 440-505 cm-1 (Mn-O 
stretching). Adsorption peak of Mn-O stretching in Fig. 6(1a) has very small 
absorbance; it confirms that the small concentration of KMnO4 cause the oxidation 
of Mn2+ is not easy to conduct to MnO2.  
The ratio of absorbance heights between quinoide and benzenoide structure in 
PANI-MnO2 is 0.8 averagely. It is due to the PANI-MnO2 is in the leucoemeraldine 
state that PANI accepts more electron from KMnO4. The reduction of KMnO4 to 
MnO2 contributed in polymerization of aniline monomer to become fully-reduced 
state of PANI.  
Fig. 7 shows the amperometric response of (a) PANI-trapped MnO2 and (b) 
PANI-untrapped MnO2 nanocomposite electrodes to successive 0.10 mM additions 
of H2O2 at applied potential of +0.65 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The steady-state signal 
produced by PANI-trapped MnO2 nanoparticles (2.78 s) is much faster than that 
produced by MnO2 without PANI trapping (26.0 s). This can be attributed to the 
reduction of MnO2, which led to more Mn2+ dissolution at the electrode of MnO2 
without PANI trapping. The dissolution of MnO2 also decreased the electroactive 
surface area of the electrode. Consequently, the addition of more H2O2 increased 
noise. In contrast, the signal to noise ratio remained constant for the PANI-trapped 
MnO2 nanocomposite electrode because PANI nanofibers that surrounded MnO2 
protected the MnO2 nanoparticles from dissolving. It is noted that noise could also

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MnO2 nanoparticles trapped in PANI 
nanofibers could be used as a novel electrocatalyst for H2O2 oxidation. The 
PANI-trapped MnO2 nanocomposite electrode had higher stability and sensitivity in 
sensing H2O2 compared to the MnO2 without PANI trapping electrode because the 
PANI nanofibers protected MnO2 from the irreversible dissolution to Mn2+ ions. In 
addition, the decrease of the local pH value on the electrode surface retains the 
electroactivity of PANI because of protonation (i.e. doping) of PANI. Further 
research is in progress to explore the use of PANI-trapped MnO2 nanoparticles for 
other biocatalysis and biosensing applications. In particular, the PANI-trapped 
MnO2 nanocatalysts with high stability against proton-induced MnO2 dissolution 
might find important applications in removing pollutants such as atrazine from the 
environment.
