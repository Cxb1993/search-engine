Abstract — This report presents the results about reliable and high performance full car active suspension 
systems design with considering the possible elements failure and vehicle body mass variation. In the first year, we 
study the controller synthesis problem for half car active suspension systems with considering the possible elements 
(springs and dampers) failure. Based on the simultaneous ∞HLQG /  control approach, static output feedback 
controllers are derived to achieve good suspension performance for all possible spring and/or damper failures. This 
problem cannot be solved by LMI approach since in general its admissible solution set is nonconvex. Based on the 
barrier method, we instead solve an auxiliary minimization problem to obtain an approximate solution to the original 
problem. Moreover, numerical algorithms for getting the optimal solution are proposed. The simulation shows that the 
presented approach achieves better active safety performance than traditional design methods.  
In the second year, we consider the reliable and robust controllers design for full car active suspension systems with considering 
the possibility of sensors and actuators failures. Based on combining the concepts of simultaneous control approach (for overcoming 
the sensors and actuators failures), mixed ∞HLQG /  control approach (LQG method is for suppressing the suspension travel and 
∞H  control is for reducing the forces acting on the passengers), and regional pole placement approach (for improving the transient 
response), a novel method is proposed for designing a single static output feedback suspension controller to achieve good suspension 
performance for a suspension system in all possible sensors and actuators failures. The LMI approach is also not applicable for this 
problem and a barrier method is developed for solving this problem.

solved to obtain an approximate solution of the original problem. The new cost function is the sum of the original cost function 
and a weighted "barrier function". The minimal point of the auxiliary cost function exists and is a stationary point. Therefore, 
the Lagrange multiplier method is used to derive the necessary conditions for optimum. In fact, the minimal solution of the 
auxiliary minimization problem converges to the infimal solution of the original problem if the weighting factor of the barrier 
function approaches zero (please see [12]). Moreover, based on the steepest descent method, we develop numerical algorithms 
to solve the auxiliary minimization problem. 
In the second year of this project, we consider the reliable static output feedback controllers design for full car active 
suspension systems with considering the possibility of sensors and actuators failures. Based on combining the concepts of 
simultaneous control approach (for overcoming the elements failure), mixed ∞HLQG /  control approach (LQG method is for 
suppressing the suspension travel and ∞H  control is for reducing the forces acting on the passengers), and regional pole 
placement approach (for improving the transient response), a novel method is proposed for designing a single static output 
feedback suspension controller to achieve good suspension performance for a suspension system in all possible sensors and 
actuators failures. For a collection of linear systems, we try to find a single static output feedback controller to minimize a 
LQG-type cost function under the constraints that all the possible transfer functions of the closed-loop systems satisfy some 
desired ∞H -norm levels and that all the closed-loop poles of all possible modes are located on some desired regions. This 
problem is also a constrained optimization problem and the LMI approach is not applicable. Based on the barrier method (see 
[12]), an auxiliary minimization problem is solved to obtain an approximate solution of the original problem. We found in [26] 
and [27] that the barrier method is a feasible approach in solving constraint optimization problems with nonconvex admissible 
solutions set. Based on the presented approach, we can design a static output feedback controller to achieve good suspension 
properties even if there are elements failures. The proposed approach significantly improves the active safety and increases the 
ride quality for advanced vehicles.

2.1 The Auxiliary Minimization Problem 
    The considered problem is a constrained optimization problem. To solve this problem analytically is very difficult since its 
minimal solution may not exist. In fact, its infimal solution may lie on the boundary of the set ),,( 1 NS γγ L∞ ; and furthermore, 
it may not be a stationary point. In this paper, motivated by the barrier method (please see [12]), we instead solve an auxiliary 
minimization problem to obtain an approximate solution of the original problem. The auxiliary cost function Jaux(F) is the sum 
of the actual cost function )(FJ  and an additional weighted barrier function )()( FJFJ s ∞+ . As shown in [12], a barrier 
function must satisfy: 1) it is continuous, 2) it is nonnegative over the admissible solution set, and 3) it will approach infinity as 
F approaches the boundary of the admissible solution set. We will show that the barrier function )()( FJFJ s ∞+ , defined 
below, satisfy these requirements. 
It is known that the objective function )(FJi  is equivalent to

 As stated in [12], although the auxiliary minimization problem is, from a formal viewpoint, a minimization problem with 
inequality constraints; for a computational viewpoint it is unconstrained. The advantage of the auxiliary minimization problem 
is that it can be solved by unconstrained search techniques. Moreover, the optimal solution of the auxiliary minimization 
problem converges to the infimal solution of the original problem as the weighting factors 0→ic and  0→id , i=1,2,…,N.  
 The above theorem provides not only a necessary conditions for optimum, but also a method to calculate the gradient 
direction of Jaux(F). The gradient of Jaux(F) at F is

Suppose the measured output is 
                [ ] .44332211 Tususususc zzzzzzzzzy −−−−= φθ &&&  
It can be measured by four LVDTs, one accelerator, two gyroscopes, and three integrators. Without elements failure and mass 
variation, the linearized dynamic model of full car active suspension system can be expressed by: 
                      uBwBAxx 21 ++=&                  (3.1) 
                      xCy 2=                       (3.2) 
where A , 1B , 2B , and 2C  are given in the Appendix.  
 The main objective for designing active suspension systems is to suppress the suspension deflections and the forces acting 
on the passengers as the vehicle moving on rough road profiles. To these ends, let the controlled output variables be: 
             [ ] uDxCzz Tc 121 +==∞ φθ &&&&&&                       (3.3) 
             [ ] xCzzzzzzzzz TususususLQ 144332211 ˆ=−−−−=            (3.4) 
where 1C , 12D , and 1Cˆ  are provided in the Appendix.  It is clear that the variable ∞z  reflects the forces acting on the 
passengers and the variable LQz  reflects the suspension travel. We can suppress the forces acting on the passengers if we can 
reduce the 2L -gain from w to ∞z . Moreover, we can reduce the suspension travel if we can minimize ∫∞0 dtzz LQTLQ . Beside 
the concerns of force and suspension travel, it is desired that the suspension systems have good the transient responses. The 
transient response of a suspension system heavily depends on the locations of its closed-loop poles. We can achieve good 
transient response by placing the closed-loop poles in some specified regions. In this paper, the ∞H  control approach is 
employed to suppress the force acting on the passengers, the LQG optimal control approach is used to reduce the suspension 
travel, and the regional pole placement method is employed to improve the transient response.  
Since we consider the possibility of sensors and actuators failures, the considered suspension system has N possible dynamic 
models:

The matrices iB2 , i=1,…,N, are obtained by setting the i-th column of B2 (in the Appendix) to be zero, and iC2 , i=1,…,N,  are 
obtained by setting the i-th row of 2C  (in the Appendix) to be zero.  
The main goal of this section is to design a static output feedback controller for the collection of modes (3.5) of a suspension 
system to achieve good suspension performance for all possible sensors and actuators failures. Note that we can reduce the 
force acting on the passengers by reducing the magnitude of ∞z ; we can reduce the suspension travel by reducing the

 As stated in [26] and [27], to solve the considered constrained optimization problem analytically is almost impossible since 
its minimal solution may not exist. In fact, its infimal solution may lie on the boundary of the set 
),...,( 111 ,,...,,,..., NNNfS γγμμαα ; and furthermore, it is in general not a stationary point. Based on the barrier method 
(please see [12], [26], and [27]), we instead solve an auxiliary minimization problem to obtain an approximate solution of the 
original problem. The auxiliary cost function Jaux(F) is the sum of the actual cost function )(FJ  and an additional weighted 
barrier function )()( FJFJ p ∞+ , which will be defined below.

3.2 The Auxiliary Minimization Problem 
The auxiliary minimization problem can be formulated as: Find F, over ),...,( 111 ,,...,,,..., NNNfS γγμμαα , to minimize 
the auxiliary cost function

by Lemmas 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, it is clear that )()( FJFJ p ∞+  is a barrier function for the considered minimization problem. 
Moreover, since the auxiliary cost function ∞→)(FJ aux  as F approaching, from interior, the boundary of

minimum point in the interior of the admissible solutions set ),...,( 111 ,,...,,,..., NNNfS γγμμαα . In addition, it is a stationary 
point. The Lagrange multiplier method can be employed to derive the necessary conditions for local optimum of Jaux(F). Then, 
we have the following result.

29.768 mkgJ ⋅= , and ml f 38.1=  and mlr 36.1= . In here we consider the case that there may one spring or one damper be 
damaged: 
Case 1: Normal case. No element failures happen. 
Case 2: The front spring is damaged ( mNksf /0= ).

Example 4.2: 
Consider the half car active suspension system shown in Fig. 2.1. Let the normal parameters of the considered suspension 
systems are: kgms 7.574= , kgmm afar 5.59== , mNkk sfsr /16812== , mNbb sfsr sec/1000 ⋅== , 
mNkk tftr /190000== , 29.768 mkgJ ⋅= , and ml f 38.1=  and mlr 36.1= . For simplification, here we only consider the 
case that there only a sensor or an actuator fails at a time. However, we can in fact consider multiple sensors or actuators failure 
situations. We have the following possible cases: 
Case 1: Normal case (no sensors or actuators fail) 
Case 2: The sensor 1 (for measuring cz& ) fails ( 0)(1 =ty ) 
Case 3: The sensor 2 (for measuring θ& ) fails ( 0)(2 =ty ) 
Case 4: The sensor 4 (for measuring ff xx 21 − ) fails ( 0)(3 =ty ). 
Case 5: The sensor 5 (for measuring rr xx 21 − ) fails ( 0)(4 =ty ). 
Case 6: The actuator 1 fails ( 0)(1 =tu ). 
Case 7: The actuator 2 fails ( 0)(2 =tu ). 
Suppose the twenty possible dynamic models for the full car active suspension systems are expressed as: 
                   uBwBAxx i21 ++=& , i=1,…,7                   (4.2)

Example 4.3: 
Consider the suspension system shown in Fig. 3.1. Let the normal parameters of the considered suspension systems are: 
kgmmmkg sss 1200800 =≤≤= , kgmmmm 31.184321 ==== , mtt lr 8.0== , mNkkkk /8.109314321 ==== , 
mNcccc sec/5004321 ⋅==== , mNkkkk tttt /1838874321 ==== , 2120 mkgI ⋅=θ , 2300 mkgI ⋅=θ , and ml f 2.1=  
and mlr 2.1= . For simplification, here we only consider the case that there only a sensor or a actuator fails at a time. However, 
we can in fact consider multiple elements failure situations. We have the following possible cases: 
Case 1: Normal case (no sensors or actuators fail) 
Case 2: The sensor 1 (for measuring cz& ) fails ( 0)(1 =ty ) 
Case 3: The sensor 2 (for measuring θ& ) fails ( 0)(2 =ty ) 
Case 4: The sensor 3 (for measuring φ& ) fails ( 0)(3 =ty ) 
Case 5: The sensor 4 (for measuring 11 us zz − ) fails ( 0)(4 =ty ). 
Case 6: The sensor 5 (for measuring 22 us zz − ) fails ( 0)(5 =ty ). 
Case 7: The sensor 6 (for measuring 33 us zz − ) fails ( 0)(6 =ty ). 
Case 8: The sensor 7 (for measuring 44 us zz − ) fails ( 0)(7 =ty ). 
Case 9: The actuator 1 fails ( 0)(1 =tu ). 
Case 10: The actuator 2 fails ( 0)(2 =tu ). 
Case 11: The actuator 3 fails ( 0)(3 =tu ). 
Case 12: The actuator 4 fails ( 0)(4 =tu ). 
Suppose the twenty possible dynamic models for the full car active suspension systems are expressed as: 
                   uBwBAxx i21 ++=& , i=1,…,12                   (4.3)

V. CONCLUSIONS 
For designing reliable, high performance, full car active suspension systems, we have developed a novel method for 
solving a simultaneous mixed ∞HLQG /  control with regional pole constraint problem for a finite collection of linear systems. 
All the possibilities of spring failure, damper failure, sensor failure, and actuator failure have been considered. For practical 
consideration, static output feedback laws have been used. The problems cannot be solved via the LMI approach since the 
admissible solutions sets are nonconvex in general. Based on the barrier method, we instead solve auxiliary minimization 
problems to obtain approximate solutions. The necessary conditions for which the optimal solution of the auxiliary 
minimization problems  must be satisfied have been derived. Numerical algorithms have been established for solving the 
considered problems. The simulation shows that the presented approach achieves better active safety performance than 
traditional design methods.
