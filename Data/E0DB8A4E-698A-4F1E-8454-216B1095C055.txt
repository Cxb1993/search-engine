5. Terminate decoding 
 
4. Conclusion 
A list decoding algorithm of [n, k] GRS is capable of correcting more than  errors 
[10]-[13]. The EKE interpolation in list decoding is in time complexity [13], while the 
proposed EKE interpolation takes time complexity  resulting from several EKE 
interpolations performed at same time. In addition, since there is a codeword-checking involved in 
this modified list decoding, decoding complexity of this decoding drastically reduces as the signal 
to noise ratio increases.
