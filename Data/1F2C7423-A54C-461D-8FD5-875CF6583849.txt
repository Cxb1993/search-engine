modulation scheme had been conducted.  Details of the research results are explained next. 
 
3. Study of improved dispersion map design using RZ-DPSK and DFF 
The dispersion flattened fiber (DFF) is a well-known solution to improve the transmission 
performance of the conventional IM-DD system.  The DFF is also effective to improve the 
transmission performance of the RZ-DPSK system, but an optimum design of the dispersion map 
seemed different from that of the conventional IM-DD system.  The IM-DD based system 
preferred the block type dispersion map, while the RZ-DPSK based system preferred the 
block-less type dispersion map.  Considering the compatibility with the legacy system (i.e., 
IM-DD based system), it is important to study a method to improve the design of the block type 
dispersion map for the RZ-DPSK based system.  This topic has been conducted to solve this 
issue. 
Figure 1 shows the system model used in this study.  96 channels WDM transmission system 
with 6000km transmission distance was investigated.  Figure 2 shows comparison of dispersion 
maps.  “Original” is the conventional block type dispersion map, and “Slanted” is the modified 
block type map that is slightly tilted from the original one.  Figure 3 shows the simulated results.  
For the slanted block type map, the cumulative dispersion should be compensated, and three 
different compensation schemes were adopted.  They were pre-compensation, 
post-compensation, and pre- and post-compensation.  Figure 4 shows the simulated results of 
the transmission performance.  It is obvious that the slanted map improved the transmission 
performance.  From this result, it can be concluded that the slanted block type dispersion map 
could realize the improved transmission performance of the long-haul RZ-DPSK based system 
using the DFF.

transmission performance of the long-haul RZ-DPSK system, while the XPM was a minor.  
Experimental study has been conducted to confirm these observations.  A recirculating loop 
transmission line was configured to simulate the long distance transmission with only 500km 
optical fiber. 
Figure 4 shows the experimental setup.  Due to the limitation of the equipment, 5 WDM 
transmission was conducted, and the performance of the center channel was evaluated.  In order 
to evaluate the XPM impact, transmission performance difference between all modulated 
channels and CW neighbor channels was compared.  The result is shown in Figure 5.  As 
shown in this figure, the performance did not change so significantly between the modulated and 
the CW neighbor channels, it was concluded that the XPM did not have any significant impact 
upon the transmission performance of the long-haul RZ-DPSK based system.  In order to 
evaluate the SPM impact, transmission performance was measured as a function of the repeater 
output power.  The result is shown in Figure 6.  As shown in this figure, the optimum repeater 
output power is different between the channel close to the system zero dispersion wavelength and 
the channel far from the system zero dispersion wavelength.  As a matter of fact, the channel 
close to the system zero dispersion wavelength showed smaller optimum repeater output power, 
and this implied that this channel had larger nonlinear penalty through the SPM.  Therefore, 
larger impact of the SPM for the channels close to the system zero dispersion wavelength was 
confirmed experimentally.

5. Study of traffic classification scheme based on latency 
Figure 7 shows the Internet traffic in Japan.  Download traffic and upload traffic are shown 
separately.  From this figure, it is possible to draw following three conclusions.  (1) Download 
traffic is always larger than upload traffic.  (2) Increase ratio of the download traffic is around 
35% annually.  (3) Increase ratio of the upload traffic is around 25% annually.  It should be 
reasonable to assume that there are two types of traffic.  The first one is the traffic that requests 
correspondence like a voice communication, and the second one is the traffic that only flows the 
information like downloading a movie file.  The first type increases both the download and 
upload traffics, while the second type increases only the download traffic.  From (1), it can be 
concluded that the second type of traffic shares a significant amount in the total traffic, and from 
(2) and (3), it can be concluded that the second type of traffic is growing faster than the first type 
of traffic.  These two types of traffic have different feature of the latency requirement.  As the 
first type needs interactive exchange of the information, this type requires low latency.  On the 
other hand, the second type transfers information for one direction, so, this type is tolerable to 
high latency.  Then, it is possible to propose a novel scheme to classify the traffic by latency 
requirement.  The traffic with low latency requirement uses a wavelength path with low latency, 
and the traffic tolerable to high latency uses a wavelength path with high latency.  For the 
wavelength path with high latency, it is possible to enhance the spectral efficiency by adopting a 
strong forward error correction (FEC), a nonlinear compensation scheme, and so on.  As those 
techniques need long processing delay time, it will cause high latency. 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic classification scheme, evolution of 
the Internet traffic and required system bandwidth was calculated.  For this calculation, 
followings are assumed based on the data shown in Figure 7.  (1) Initial traffic is 1400Gbps 
download and 900Gbps upload.  (2) Annual growth rate is 35% download and 25% upload.  (3) 
Maximum spectral efficiency is 2 bit/s/Hz for low latency wavelength and 8 bit/s/Hz for high 
latency wavelength.  Figure 8 shows the results.  Evolutions of download traffic and upload 
traffic are shown by a dashed line and a solid line, respectively.  A dotted dashed line shows an 
increase of the traffic with high latency.  As shown here, the traffic with high latency will hold a 
dominant part of the Internet traffic in near future.  Required bandwidth of the network was also 
calculated.  The dotted line shows the case with only low latency wavelengths and the solid line 
shows the case with the proposed scheme.  As shown in the figure, proposed scheme greatly 
reduced the required bandwidth, thus, enhanced the bandwidth utilization efficiency.  As a 
matter of fact, full C-band would be running our within 6 years for the case of the low latency 
wavelength only, but it could be extended to 8 years for the case of the proposed traffic 
classification scheme.  In addition, full C+L-band would not be enough after 8 years for the case 
of the low latency wavelength only, but there would still be a little margin after 10 years for the 
case of the proposed scheme.

system.  Then, it was studied experimentally to apply the CDFA for the next generation PON 
intending to extend the system reach. 
Figure 9 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup.  A 40 Gbit/s, 1550 nm 
transmitter utilized a LiNbO3 external modulator, whereas a 10 Gbit/s, 1300 nm transmitter used 
a directly modulated DFB laser.  Both transmitters used 215-1 pseudorandom pattern.  A 40 
Gbit/s, 1550 nm receiver used an EDFA pre-amplified photo-detector, whereas a 10 Gbit/s, 1300 
nm receiver used a photo-detector followed by an electrical amplifier.  A 10 km non-zero 
dispersion shifted fiber (NZDSF) was used as the transmission line.  The fiber had +4.3 
ps/nm/km and -17 ps/nm/km chromatic dispersion at 1550 nm and 1300 nm, respectively. 
Figure 10 shows the measured BER performance.  0.4 dB and 1.6 dB penalties for a 40 Gbit/s, 
1550 nm signal were observed with the CDFA and after 10 km transmission, respectively.  The 
penalty after transmission was mainly due to the chromatic dispersion of the fiber.  There was 
no penalty after the CDFA for a 10 Gbit/s, 1300 nm signal and 0.7 dB improvement was observed 
after 10 km transmission.  As the NZDSF had positive group velocity dispersion and the directly 
modulated DFB laser had negative chirp, the optical pulse after the transmission was compressed 
to improve the receiver sensitivity.

Figure 12 shows the effect of the waveform truncation.  The length of the truncation was varied, 
and the frequency spectrum was calculated.  As shown in this figure, the waveform truncation 
increased the floor level of the spectrum skirts at both sides.  By increasing the truncation length, 
the floor level decreased gradually.

It was confirmed that the waveform truncation did not cause significant impact to the main 
rectangular spectrum component, but it caused increase of the spectral skirts at both sides.  This 
would cause increase of the crosstalk between neighboring WDM channels.  Therefore, 
numerical simulations to qualitatively characterize the impact of WDM crosstalk were conducted.

nm were modulated independently by 16QAM signal with 40 Gbaud.  After multiplexing, the
