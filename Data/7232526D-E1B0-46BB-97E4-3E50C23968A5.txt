Previous research results indicate that the sound pressure level of the sound generated by
the piezoelectric actuator with a flat plate in a tube filled with air can be as high as 140 dB
(rel. 2×10−5 Pa) at a frequency of 2.6 kHz even without the installment of acoustic reflector
at the other end. In order to increase the sound pressure level to the desired level (165
dB), we encounter two difficulties. The first difficulty comes from the lack of a proper power
amplifier for driving the low-voltage piezoelectric actuator. The second difficulty comes from
the limited stroke of piezoelectric actuator, which is insufficient for producing the acoustic
waves necessary for significant thermoacoustic effect if without proper acoustic amplification.
The fabrication of a thermoacoustic stack presents another challenging task. In order
to achieve an effective heat transfer between the stack material and the gas experiencing
acoustic wave, the boundary layer thickness of the gas flow, δν =
√
2ν
ω
, should be smaller than
the thermal penetration depth δκ =
√
2K
ρcpω
such that effective heat transfer via conduction
between the stack and gas can be achieved and transported to the downstream by the gas
undergoing acoustic wave. In air at 1 kHz, we have δν = 66µm and δκ = 80µm. As indicated
in [5], the optimum spacing for the stack plates is from 2δκ to 4δκ. Therefore, this requires
the cross-sectional area to be filled with plates spaced from 160µm to 320µm. Stacks with
plates at a spacing gap less than 100 µm are difficult to fabricate without resorting to
microfabrication technologies.

processes. A recipe of fabrication processes without the need of dicing cut will be introduced
below.
The fabrication process of the thermoacoustic stack starts with a double side polished
(100) wafer with substrate thickness of 525 µm. (1) The target wafer is attached to a bare
silicon carrier wafer first. (2) The target wafer will be coated with TEOS oxide through
plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) used as an etch mask to protect the
silicon underneath. (3) Photolithographic process is applied to pattern the 10 µm-thick
positive-type photoresist (AZ4620) on top of the oxide. See Figure 3. (4) The target wafer
Figure 3: Mask used to pattern the thermoacoustic stack plates.
is etched through with an inductively coupled plasma etcher (ICP). (5) The dies can be
separated from the carrier wafer by immersing the whole wafer in acetone. (8) Then the
oxide on top of the dies can be removed by dipping them into buffered hydrofluoric acid
(BHF). (9) Finally, the dies will be aligned and bonded. All the processes can be done in
the Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems Research Center at National Taiwan University. A
picture of the microfabricated stack plates is shown in Figure 4. If the devices are to be used

aluminum end piece housing a pressure sensor to form a rigid reflection wall. To account
for the possible drift of sound speed due to the change of temperature from day to day, the
aluminum end piece is made movable for fine tuning.
In this study, the acoustic driving system is fabricated by attaching an acrylic piston to
a LVPZT stack actuator1 (Piezomechanik GmbH PSt 150/2×3/20) using epoxy. However,
this LVPZT actuator demands a large current to operate due to its huge capacitance (316
nF) associated with the hundred layers of PZT. The driving signal coming from the function
generator (Tektronix AFG 3021) is amplified by a power amplifier (NF HSA 4012) to generate
the electric current to drive the stack actuator.
For high frequency pressure measurements, a 5
8
-in ICP quartz pressure microphone (PCB
106B52, rise time ≤ 12.5µs) with a sensitivity of 725 mV/kPa is flush-mounted in the rigid
aluminum end piece and powered by a signal conditioner (PCB 480C02). The pressure
microphone has a wide dynamic range (from 86 dB to 170 dB) and allows for accurate
measurements of the very high sound pressure levels that might be enountered in this study.
The pressure signal is then fed into a personal computer via a 16-bit data acquisition board
(NI PCI 6221) for post processing.
3.4 Numerical Simulations
In order to correlate our experimental data with numerical calculations, the problem is
analyzed numerically using the commercial CFD software FLUENT. Our numerical model
is based on the nonlinear equations governing the gas dynamics for an ideal gas inside an
axisymmetric resonance tube with length L and radius a at ambient temperature T0 as

Consider the case of u0 = 6.0 m/s without the stack inside the resonance tube. In
Figure 7, the spatial distributions of the velocity and pressure fields are plotted at various
time t = 0.0, 0.1, · · · , 1.0. As can be seen from the diagram, nonlinear effects bring in the
high frequency components into the dyanmics of velocity and pressure fields and are totally
different from the results predicted by linear theory.
4 Self Evaluation and Future Works
Our research goals aiming at building prototypes of microscale thermoacoustic heat engines
and exploring key design parameters that dominates the performance of the thermoacoustic
heat engines. A brief summary of the major achievements accomplished in this year are
listed below:
1. An open-loop ultrasonic generator that is capable of producing high-amplitude acous-
tic wave at the frequency range of 10 to 100 kHz stably have been designed and
constructed.
2. Stacks with plates spaced at 280 µm have been successfully fabricated using MEMS
technologies and demonstrated the feasibility and flexibility of our microfabrication
processes.
3. From the numerical calculation, it is found that miniature thermoacoustic devices
exhibit significant nonlinear effects that must be taken into account in the design of
miniature thermoacoustic devices.
