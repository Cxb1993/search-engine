 
that govern the workers’ lifting speed. Therefore, an investigation on the effects of 
lifting speed on human responses is necessary for both theoretical and practical 
studies of manual lifting activities. This study was to examine the effects of different 
lifting speeds and loads on lifters’ muscular responses and postures in manual lifting 
from the floor to elbow height. 
 
Methods 
Participants and equipment 
This study recruited twelve young healthy male participants in experiment. The 
main experiment equipment in this study included a set of digital Biometrics’ 
goniometer, motion analysis system and an EMG system. The EMG system is used to 
pick up, amplify, filter (band pass 20-500 Hz), rectify and process the EMG signals to 
provide the root mean square (RMS) EMG. The RMS EMG is sampled via BioGraph 
& ProComp+ computer software (Thought Technology LTD. Montreal, Quebec, 
Canada).  
 
Experimental design 
The independent variable for this study was lifting speed (slow, normal, fast) and 
lifting weights (10 kg, 20 kg and 30 kg). The fast, normal and slow lifting speeds are 
defined to be in the interval of 0.75 to 1 s, 1.25 to 1.5 s, and 1.75 to 2 s, respectively. 
The dependent variable for this study was lifters’ muscle responses, postural change 
and lifting velocity. The lifters’ muscle responses were collected by EMG system, 
including those for the right biceps, right erector spinae, and right quadriceps, 
synchronously with the goniometer and motion analysis system. For comparing the 
muscular activity between experimental trials, the signals for lifters’ EMG were 
normalized by expressing % MVC (maximum voluntary contraction) of each 
monitored muscle (Mirka and Marras 1991). The lifters’ postural responses, including 
those for the elbow angle, trunk angle, and knee angle were depicted in Figure 1. 
increased, heavier weight was associated with a greater maximum lifting velocity and 
a longer time of occurrence of maximum lifting velocity. 
 
 Figure 4 to 9 show the angle velocity of lifters’ elbow, shoulder, trunk, knee and 
ankle angles, respectively. According to the data, several phenomena were found. 
These phenomena reflected different lifting strategies across different lifting speeds 
and weights. Firstly, lifting heavier weight or faster lifting would result in greater 
maximum angle velocity for most joints in lifting. Secondly, lifters tend to move the 
weight closer to the body in the initial phase for heavier weight as shown in shoulder 
angle. Thirdly, lifters elbow, shoulder and trunk angle velocities remained high at the 
end of lifting for lifting a heavier weight in a fast speed. Fourthly, the knee and ankle 
velocities for fast lifting were appreciably larger than those for medium and slow 
lifting at the lift-off moment, implying ankle and knee joints seemed to play an 
important role in fast lifting. Fifth, lifters’ ankle velocity demonstrated an 
increase-decrease-increase pattern when lifting a heavy weight.  
Lifting strategies adopted by lifters in responding to different speeds and weights 
were clearly found. For fast lifting, lifters mainly utilized lower extremities, quickly 
increasing both knee and ankle velocities, and pulled the object closer to the body. 
For heavy lifting, lifters usually overexerted their strengths, resulting in higher angle 
velocities and thus momentum in the lifting, and this momentum could not be 
adequately controlled for heavy weight lifting at the end of lifting. Additionally, only 
a higher maximum angle was observed in ankle joint among lower extremities for 
heavy lifting, indicating lifters had a tendency to lean backwards in the initial lifting 
phase, which is helpful for body stability while lifting heavy weight. 
Lifters’ peak muscle activities during the lifting were collected for analysis. Figure 
10 and 11 show the speed and weight effects on peak muscle activities during the 
lifting. The data showed that lifting weight obviously affected muscle activities. 
Muscle activities increased with lifting weight. For example, as the lifting weight
