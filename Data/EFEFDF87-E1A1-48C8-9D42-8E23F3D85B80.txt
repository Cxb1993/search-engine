 英文摘要： 
Keywords: ultrafast optics, nonlinear optics, pulse measurement, quasi-phase matching 
 
The ambitious goal of this proposal is to improve on the world record of sensitivity of 
self-referenced complete femtosecond pulse measurement techniques by tens of times via the 
marriage of modified interferometric field autocorrelation (MIFA) method and the proprietary 
reverse proton exchange (RPE) periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide technology 
that have been established by our group at National Tsing Hua University and Prof. Martin M. 
Fejer’s group at Stanford University, respectively. The sensitivity improvement will not rely on 
expensive detection module nor impractically long integration time, but theoretical novelty of 
MIFA method that hits the sensitivity limit of pulse measurement using second-order nonlinearity 
as well as the unparalleled conversion efficiency of RPE PPLN waveguide. The pulse 
measurement work will also enable full characterization of complex phase-matching spectrum of 
arbitrary quasi-phase matching (QPM) grating, providing a powerful tool for ferroelectric domain 
engineering. These research goals, however, can hardly be accomplished by the funding of our 
existing NSC project considering the costs of our Stanford collaborators to make RPE PPLN 
waveguides (no commercial product, nor can be provided by other research group) and the 
thermal noise reduction module for our photomultiplier tube.

By low-pass filtering the raw trace 
FR
P )(2 τω , we can derive a fringe-free trace of the form: 
)(21)( 22 ττω GP +∝ , 
where 
)()()()( 22 tItItIG ττ −≡        (1) 
is the normalized intensity autocorrelation function [ 2)()( tatI = ]. For well-behaved pulse shapes, 
the pulse width Δt can be roughly estimated (with an uncertainty of ~10%) by deconvolution of 
the correlation width Δτ of )(2 τG . Nevertheless, )(2 τG  only delivers very limited pulse 
information for lack of information about temporal phase of )(ta  and spectral phase of intensity 
)(tI . 
 
Fig. 1.  Schematic diagram of intensity autocorrelation measurement. MI: Michelson interferometer. 
Intensity autocorrelation measurement is intrinsically more sensitive than other techniques 
designed to deliver “complete” pulse information, for it does not need frequency-resolved optics 
and only relies on slow point detector, which can be made extremely sensitive when using 
photomultiplier tube and lock-in amplifier. As a result, intensity autocorrelation measurement 
using thin bulk SHG crystals offers a sensitivity of about 1 mW2. Significant improvement of 
sensitivity has been achieved by using SHG in A-PPLN waveguide (3.2×10-7 mW2) [7], where 
50-MHz, 220-fs pulse train at 1.5-μm can be measured with an average power as low as 1.3 nW 
(equivalent to 0.24-mW peak power, 52 aJ or 400 photons per pulse). 
 
II. Frequency resolved optical gating (FROG): 
FROG [8] is a time-frequency technique to derive complete amplitude and phase information. It 
applies the strategy of: (1) using the unknown pulse itself for ultrafast gating; (2) recording data 
points more than the degrees of freedom (data redundancy), then retrieving the complex field by 
iteration. Fig. 2 shows the schematic diagram of conventional second-harmonic generation (SHG) 
FROG. The noncollinear SHG geometry can spatially separate the field product term 
)()( τ−⋅ tata  from the remaining self-squared terms )(2 ta , )(2 τ−ta . By measuring the 
second-harmonic power spectrum for each delay τ, we obtain the FROG trace: 
{ }2)()(),( ττω −⋅= tataFI FROG       (2)

concatenation. 
Fig. 3.  Schematic diagram of SPIDER. 
Only a limited number of approaches, such as homodyne optical technique (HOT) SPIDER 
[11], electro-optic shearing interferometry [12], have been proposed to improve the sensitivity of 
SPIDER. However, they rely on either a strong reference pulse [11], or a high-speed phase 
modulator [12], which is not self-referenced or subject to poor temporal resolution (400 fs). 
SPIDER using thick nonlinear crystal has been reported [13], but its merit largely lies on 
elimination of the highly chirped pulse in spectral shearing (instead of sensitivity improvement) 
and is only applicable for particular combination of the crystal’s material, length, and the 
wavelength range. In standard SPIDER, either type-2 or noncollinear type-1 phase matching 
has to be utilized for nonlinear mixing, such that the undesired SHG signal due to 
self-interaction can be either suppressed (not phase-matched) or spatially separated from the 
desired sum-frequency generation signal given they are spectrally degenerated. Since straight 
lithium niobate waveguide made by proton exchange only guides TM polarization (only ne is 
increased), type-2 phase matching is prohibited. Furthermore, typical straight waveguides only 
supports collinear geometry (unless using asymmetric Y-junction devices [14,15]), disabling the 
employment of collinear type-1 phase matching as well. As a result, SPIDER cannot employ the 
highly efficient RPE PPLN straight waveguide [4]. 
 
IV. High-efficiency wavelength conversion by reverse proton exchange (RPE) PPLN 
waveguide: (This section is based on materials provided by M. M. Fejer’s group.) 
Second-order nonlinear waveguide devices are the key components for the ultrashort pulse 
measurement scheme suggested in this proposal. Prof. Fejer’s group at Stanford University has 
developed a number of techniques to enable efficient nonlinear optical mixing processes, and in 
particular to optimize devices operating in the 1.5-μm communications band. The two key steps 
are microstructuring the nonlinear medium to enable quasi-phase matching (QPM) and 
fabrication of waveguides to confine the light over long interaction lengths to increase the 
nonlinear mixing efficiency. We briefly review these techniques, which will be the keys to 
achieve record sensitivity of femtosecond pulse measurement.

Waveguides 
The efficiency of the frequency conversion process is significantly enhanced in waveguides 
where tight confinement of the interacting waves is maintained over long distances. The 
waveguide fabrication process is now briefly described (Fig. 6). After the periodic poling, an 
SiO2 mask is sputtered on the +z or –z surface of the wafer, and channels are etched into the mask 
after lithographic definition in photoresist. The patterned channels are then proton exchanged (PE) 
in benzoic acid to form waveguides. PE gives a step-index profile (Δne=0.09 at 1550 nm), 
allowing for tight optical confinement (Fig. 7, first column). However, the propagation loss could 
be high (0.5-1 dB/cm), and there is a dead layer on the surface where χ(2) nonlinearity is nearly 
erased [17]. A subsequent annealing step leads to the diffusion of protons deeper into the 
substrate, reducing the peak index change on the surface, smoothening the index profile (Fig. 7, 
second column), and partially recovering the surface χ(2) [17]. This allows formation of diffused 
channel (APE) waveguides characterized by low loss (0.2 dB/cm) and high SHG conversion 
efficiency (up to 50 %/Wcm2, or 1250%/W for a 5-cm-long device) [4]. The modal peaks of 
fundamental and second-harmonic waves are nevertheless mismatched in the APE guides, for the 
highest index remains on the surface for either wavelength.

I. Modified interferometric field autocorrelation (MIFA) method: 
MIFA is a new method proposed and experimentally demonstrated by our group to analytically 
(non-iteratively) reconstruct spectral phase profile by measuring double one-dimensional 
interferometric autocorrelation traces using thick nonlinear crystals [3]. 
Fig. 8.  Schematic diagram of MIFA measurement. MI: Michelson interferometer. 
Fig. 8 illustrates the schematic diagram of MIFA measurement.  The scalar e-field of the pulse is 
represented by: { }tfjetate 02)(Re)( π= , where Re[ ] denotes real part, a(t) is the complex temporal 
envelope, and 0f  represents the carrier frequency, respectively. A collinear Michelson 
interferometer produces a pulse pair )()()( τω −+= tetete  (τ is the variable delay), 
corresponding to a nonlinear polarization spectrum { })()( 2 teFfPNL ω=  centered at 02 f  (F{…} 
denotes Fourier transform). By using a thick nonlinear crystal with narrow phase-matching 
spectrum )(1 fH  centered at 02 f , the generated second-harmonic spectrum and average power 
are proportional to )2()()( 01 fPfHfP NLNL ∝⋅  and: 
)(1 τS ∝ 21 )(21 τG′+ + [ ] )2cos()(Re4 01 τπτ fG ′ + )4cos( 0τπf ,    (4) 
respectively, where the modified field autocorrelation function is defined as [3]: 
)()()()( 21 tatataG ττ −≡′         (5) 
The Fourier transform of eq. (4), denoted by )(~1 κS , consists of five spectral components 
centered at delay-frequencies of 0=κ , 0f± , and 02 f± , respectively.  By extracting the 
components centered at 0=κ  and 0f=κ , we can get the modulus and real part of )(1 τG′  
( )(1 τG′  and [ ])(Re 1 τG′ ), respectively. This enables the determination of the complex function 
)(1 τG′  for the phase of )(1 τG′  can be evaluated by: 
)(1 τG′∠ = [ ]{ })()(Recos 111 ττ GG ′′− . 
The Fourier transform of eq. (5) becomes: 
[ ]{ })()(exp)()()()()(~1 ffjfAfAfAfAfG −+−=−∝′ ψψ    (6) 
where { } )()()()( fjefAtaFfA ψ==  stands for the spectral envelope of the pulse. The phase of 
10 
where )( fPNL = { })(2 taF  and )( fH  represent the nonlinear polarization spectrum of the input 
pulse and the phase-matching spectrum provided by the nonlinear crystal, respectively. The 
“available nonlinearity”, defined as the phase-matching spectral area: 
∫ ∞∞−=   2)( dffHNLη ,       (11) 
can be used as a measure about the “potential” of the nonlinear crystal to produce 
second-harmonic yield. Under the condition of non-depleted pump, a uniform nonlinear crystal of 
length L (including PPLN) provides: 
)( fH ∝ ( )LfL πηsinc⋅ , )()2( 0101 fvfv gg −− −=η      (12) 
where gv  denotes group velocity, and 0f  is the fundamental carrier frequency. Chirping the 
QPM period (A-PPLN) may broaden the width of )( fH  without changing the “available 
nonlinearity” NLη  [7]. 
 
Fig. 9.  Spectral representations of pulsed second-harmonic generation using (a) thick PPLN in MIFA, (b) 
thick A-PPLN in intensity autocorrelation. 
For simplicity, we approximate 2)( fH  due to a PPLN of length L by a rectangular function of 
width PMW (∝L-1) and height 20H (∝L2), while 2)( fPNL  has a width PMNL nWW = (n>>1) and a 
peak value 2NLP  (Fig. 9a). Since the phase-matching bandwidth PMW  is much narrower than 
the nonlinear polarization bandwidth NLW , this configuration can be used in MIFA measurement. 
By eq. (10), the corresponding second-harmonic yield is:

On the other hand, to conduct intensity autocorrelation by using A-PPLN of the same length L, 
the QPM period has to be properly chirped such that 2)( fH  becomes a rectangular function of 
width PMnW . In this case, the height of 
2)( fH  is reduced to nH 20  such that the area of 
2)( fH  remains (Fig. 9b). By eq. (10), the corresponding second-harmonic yield is:

2) Experiments: 
 
Fig. 10.  Experimental setup of high sensitivity MIFA measurement. WDM: Wavelength division multiplexer. 
MI: Michelson interferometer. PC#: polarization controller. PD: InGaAs photodetectors. 
Fig. 10 shows the fiber-based experimental setup for our ultra-sensitive MIFA measurement. The 
signal pulse at 1560 nm comes from a passively mode-locked Er-doped fiber laser, and is 
combined with the CW reference at 1480 nm using a wavelength division multiplexer. They are 
sent into a collinear Michelson interferometer, where an electrically controlled delay line 
(VariDelay II, General photonics) is used to scan the optical delay at a speed of 1 ps per second. 
The interfered CW reference goes to an InGaAs photodetector by way of another wavelength 
division multiplexer, producing a trace used for fringe correction. The signal pulse pair are 
coupled into a fiber-pigtailed PPLN waveguide with a 49-mm-long QPM grating for SHG. The 
PM tuning curve of the PPLN waveguide has a sinc2-shape with an FWHM of ~0.24 nm 
(phase-matching bandwidth ~50 GHz, much smaller than the pulse bandwidth of 10 nm or 1.25 
THz), and the peak wavelengths are set at 1559.86 nm and 1560.34 nm (PPLN temperature at 
46°C and 50°C) when acquiring the two MIFA traces, respectively. The average second-harmonic 
power at each delay is detected by a PMT (R636-10, Hamamatsu) and lock-in amplifier. The 
lock-in time constant is set at 0.64 ms (limited by the scanning speed of the delay line and the 
required delay resolution), corresponding to a delay resolution of 0.64 fs (better than the Nyquist 
criterion of 025.0 f =1.3 fs). It only takes 10 seconds to acquire one MIFA trace with a 10-ps 
delay window. 
Fig. 11a illustrates the retrieved spectral phase profiles of a nearly bandwidth-limited pulse at 
average powers (coupled into the waveguide) of 1.5 nW (dashed-dotted) and 2.6 μW (dotted), 
respectively. In the presence of a 32 dB input power difference (64 dB difference in SHG powers), 
14 
of spectral phase profile by using MIFA processing, and the weighted average of these solutions 
gives a more robust solution (close to that obtained by FROG) against the measurement noise. 
This work has been published in Optics Express in 2010 [20].
