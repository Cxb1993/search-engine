Abstract 
  A robust control strategy is proposed in this project 
for a class of multi-input multi-output dynamic systems 
with matched and mismatched perturbations. First of all, 
a novel design methodology of switching variables is 
proposed for solving the regulation problems. A serial 
state transformation is needed in order to design pseudo 
feedback gains and adaptive mechanisms. By utilizing 
the pseudo control input gain embedded in each of the 
switching variables, not only the proposed controller 
can suppress the mismatched perturbations when the 
controlled systems are in the sliding mode, but also the 
control scheme is able to obtain locally asymptotic 
stability. The proposed robust control schemes are 
designed by means of the variable structure control 
technique with sliding mode and Lyapunov stability 
theorem. Each controller contains three parts. The first 
part is for eliminating measurable feedback signals. The 
second part is used for adjusting the convergent rate of 
state variables (or tracking errors) of the controlled 
system. The third part is an adaptive control mechanism, 
which is used to adapt some unknown least upper 
bounds of perturbations, so that the knowledge of the 
least upper bounds of matched and mismatched 
perturbations are not required. Aġ numerical example 
is demonstrated for showing the feasibility of the 
proposed control methodology.

Variable structure control (VSC) with sliding mode 
technique has been proven as an effective and robust 
control methodology for solving stabilization and 
tracking problems. The main feature of VSC is to 
employ a discontinuous control effort under the 
reaching law to drive the state from an arbitrarily initial 
state in the state space toward a designed state along a 
prespecified trajectory, i.e. the switching hyperplane, 
chosen by the designer to attain desired properties [11, 
12, 13, 24].  
According to the space spanned by the input gain 
matrix, one can divide the perturbations of systems into 
two parts, one is matched part, and the other is 
mismatched part [11, 12, 13, 24]. It is well known that 
if perturbations of the system satisfy matching 
condition, then the behavior of controlled system in the 
sliding mode is insensitive to these matched 
perturbations when employing VSC technique. But if 
the mismatched perturbations exist, then the dynamics 
of systems will still be affected by these mismatched 
perturbations even when system is in the sliding mode. 
Many scholars have focused their researches on the 
designing of VSC systems with mismatched 
perturbations. One typical achievement of these 
researches is that the state trajectories of the controlled 
systems can be driven into a bounded region so that the 
stability of the controlled system is ensured. These 
researches include [11, 12, 13, 24]. 
It has been recognized that designing the sliding 
mode controllers for systems with mismatched 
perturbations to achieve asymptotic stability is a more 
difficult job. When designing these control systems, 
most of the researchers have to put some restrictions on 
the perturbations that the systems might encounter, and 
also need the information of upper bounds of these 
perturbations. Kwan [15] treated certain states as inputs 
to a reduced-order system and designed fictitious 
controllers for these inputs, which can tackle the 
system's mismatched uncertainties, but these 
mismatched model uncertainties should be in the range

Design of Adaptive Variable Structure  
Controllers: 2n m  
Theorem 1: Consider the perturbed dynamic equation 
             1 1 1 1 ,z t A z t B t f t x        (5) 
in the sliding mode. Suppose that the pair  ,A B  in (1) 
is controllable and the mismatched perturbations in the 
domain of interest satisfy    1 1 1,f t x z t in the 
sliding mode, where 1  is a known positive constant. 
If the feedback gain 1N of the  1 t  is designed as a 
constant matrix  1 1
m n mN K R   such that all the 
eigenvalues of  1 1 1A B K  have negative real parts, 
and  1 min 1 1/ 2Q R  , where 1Q ,    1 n m n mR R    are 
positive definite symmetric matrices satisfying the 
Lyapunov equation    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
TA B K R R A B K Q     , 
then both the trajectory  1z t of the dynamic equation 
(5) and state  x t  will be locally asymptotically 
stable when the controlled system is in the sliding 
mode. 
Although the method proposed in Theorem 1 is 
quite simple and can achieve the property of locally 
asymptotic stability even if the mismatched 
uncertainties and perturbations exist after the controlled 
system is in the sliding mode, it does not offer much 
advantages over the traditional method. The reason is 
that all the information of the upper bound of 
perturbation  1 ,f t x in (5) is still required   
beforehand. 
In the following we propose another method to 
design a control scheme without requiring the 
information of upper bound of perturbation 
 1 ,f t x when 2n m . The design procedures are 
divided into several steps as follows. 
Step 1: In this step we first design the switching 
variable  1 mt R  as 
           1 1 1 1gt S t x t B N t W x t    	 
       (6) 
where the coefficient matrix  1S t  is not a constant 
matrix, and  1N t  will be redesigned in this section. 
The designed full rank constant matrix 
 

  still has to satisfy 1 0W B  . The state 
variable  x t  is transformed to

feedback gain  1N t in (6) has to be redesigned, and the 
design strategy of  1N t is demonstrated in step 2. 
Step 2: In order to design the pseudo feedback gain 
 1N t ,a new switching variable  2 mt R  is defined

A robust controller is successfully proposed to 
solve the regulation for MIMO dynamic systems with 
matched and mismatched perturbations. It is clearly 
seen that one utilize the Lyapunov stability theorem and 
variable structure control technique to design the 
control schemes, and guarantee the stability of 
controlled systems. The adaptive mechanisms, which 
are embedded in both the proposed controllers, are able 
to effectively adapt the unknown constants of the least 
upper bounds of matched and mismatched 
perturbations. A novel design method of switching 
variables is proposed to regularize a class of 
multi-inputs systems. For the case of 2n m , a serial 
state transformations are required to reduce the order of 
dynamic equations to be controlled. It is also noted that 
the proposed control scheme can only guarantee the 
locally asymptotic stability for systems with 
mismatched uncertainties which belong to vanished 
perturbations.

The purpose of this paper is to design a controller in order
to regulate the responses of (1) in spite of the existence
of perturbations. To achieve this objective successfully, the
following assumptions are assumed to be valid throughout
this paper:
A1 W Both B and A012 are nonsingular matrices.
A2 W The matrix Qd , .A
00
11 C A
00T
11 / is positive deﬁnite
symmetric matrix, which means that ReŒ.Qd / > 0.
A3 W The mismatched uncertainties  NA011 and A
0
12 satisfy
the following constraints [27]:
.a/ There exists an unknown, constant matrix F , diag

fi

2 R.n2m/.n2m/ such that  NA011 D
NA011F. In addition,
jfi j  "1 1, 1  i  n2m, where "1 is a known positive
constant and satisﬁes 1  "1 < 2.
.b/ There exists an unknown, constant matrix ‚ , diagŒi 
2 Rmm such that A012 D A
0
12‚. In addition, ji j  1"2,
1  i  m, where "2 is a known positive constant and
satisﬁes 0 < "2  1.
Remark 1: Assumptions A1 and A2 are not very conser-
vative. For instance, if A012 is not invertible, then one may
choose a nonsingular matrix to transform (1) into another
form such that A012 is nonsingular matrix.
Remark 2: In this paper we only consider the case that the
dimension of state variable x1 is greater than that of state
variable x2, i.e., n > 2m. The case of n  2m was addressed
in [26]–[28].
Designing of the sliding mode controllers generally in-
cludes two important steps. The ﬁrst step is to choose a suit-
able sliding surface function  , so that once the dynamics of
controlled system enter the sliding hyperplane, not only the
controlled system is stable, but also the desired performance
can be revealed. This step is presented in section III and IV.
The second step is to design a control force u.t/ which is
able to drive the trajectories of the controlled system into
the designated switching hyperplane  D 0 in a ﬁnite time.
This step is demonstrated in section V.

In order to achieve the property of asymptotic stability for
system (2) with mismatched perturbations, one can treat x2
as a pseudo control law when designing the sliding surface
function. The sliding surface function  2 Rm is then
designed as

Substituting (13) into (2b) and using (14), one can obtain the
dynamic equation of state x001 when system is in the sliding

Now let a Lyapunov function candidate V2 be
V2 D kx
00
1k: (19)
Differentiating (19) along the trajectory of (18) for x001 ¤ 0
and using (16), (17) yields
PV2  fmin.Qd /=2  gkx

1k: (20)
According to Theorem 1, OA011.t/ is a bounded matrix since
each value of Oa011ij is bounded, this implies that kK1.t/k is
bounded in accordance with (16). Hence from (20) one can
see that PV2 < 0 in the domain of
kx001k >


kx01k=Œmin.Qd /=2  : (21)
Note that PV2 D 0 if x
00
1 D 0, and the right hand side
of (21) is a bounded function since kK1k and kx
0
1k are
bounded when system is in the sliding mode. According to
Theorem 1, x01 will approach zero as t ! 1, this reveals
that the state variable x001 will also approach zero as t ! 1
in accordance with (21). From (13) one can see that x2 will
reach zero as t ! 1 since both x01 and x
00
1 are asymptotically
stable. Therefore, one can conclude that the state variable
x D ŒxT1 x
T
2 
T will approach zero asymptotically when the
system is in the sliding mode. 
In this paper the state variable x2 is treated as a pseudo
controller to stabilize the state x1 when the controlled system
is in the sliding mode. Note that the dimension of x2 is
smaller than that of x1, i.e., n > 2m, hence the mismatched
model uncertainties appeared in the dynamic equations of
the state variable x001 have to satisfy more strict constraints
than those in the case of n  2m [26], [27] if one uses x2 as
the pseudo controller to achieve asymptotic stability in the
sliding mode.
V. DESIGN OF ADAPTIVE SLIDING MODE CONTROLLERS
In this section the adaptive sliding mode controllers are
proposed so that the state trajectories of controlled system
can be driven into the designated sliding surface (3) in a
ﬁnite time and stay thereafter. According to Assumption A1,
the adaptive sliding mode controllers are designed as
u D un C us; (22)

The following theorem shows that the proposed control
effort (22) can indeed drive the state trajectory into the
designed sliding surface in a ﬁnite time ts .
Theorem 3: Consider the perturbed MIMO system (1)
satisfying Assumptions A1 to A3. Suppose that the sliding
surface function is designed as (3), the adaptive sliding mode
controller with the adaptive gains are designed as (22) and
(24) respectively. If

where g0 and g1 are unknown positive constants, and g2  c1

under certain conditions. The adaptive mechanisms designed
in the sliding surface function and controller can effectively
overcome the perturbations, however, the mismatched pertur-
bations still will affect the dynamics although the controlled
system is in the sliding mode.
The constraints of the mismatched model uncertainties
A0011.t; x/, A
00
12.t; x/ that the controlled system can en-
dure as seen in Theorem 2 reveal the disadvantages of the
proposed control scheme. These assumptions are not easy to
be avoided since the dimension of state variable x2 (or the
number of pseudo controllers) is less than that of the state
variable x1 to be stabilized. Therefore, these assumptions
or constraints of Theorem 2 limit the applicability of the
proposed methodology. For future study, the relaxation of
these constraints (or assumptions A2 and A3) is worth
considering.
