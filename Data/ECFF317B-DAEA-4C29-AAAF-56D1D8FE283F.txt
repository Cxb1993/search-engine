increased with the increasing curvature of the parent
vessel.
For in vivo studies of the lateral aneurysms, Suzuki
and Ohara (1978) reported that the genesis of the
aneurysm is from the gap in the media and that further
growth is developed by the hemodynamic forces and the
blood stream leading to irregularity in the dome wall
thickness with extremely thin portions. Brownlee et al.
(2003) examined a stroke caused by spontaneous
thrombosis of an unruptured intracranial aneurysm of
a 66-year-old woman. They found that the patient’s
aneurysm dome was large and the oriﬁce was small,
both of which could produce a low-ﬂow rate and
promote thrombosis. Fukuda et al. (2000) studied rat
cerebral aneurysm formation and concluded that focal
high WSS appeared to be a predisposing factor for
aneurysm formation in healthy arteries. Juvela (2003)
reported a study on prehemorrhage risk factors for fatal
intracranial aneurysm rupture. One hundred and forty-
two patients with 181 unruptured aneurysms were
followed for as long as 2 decades, for a total of 2577
person-years. His analysis indicated that the increased
systolic blood pressure value at follow-up before
aneurysm rupture was the only indisputably signiﬁcant
predictor of death among patients with aneurysm
rupture. The study suggests the importance of monitor-
ing the peak pressure inside an intracranial aneurysm.
The lack of information describing the relations
between the intra-aneurysmal ﬂow characteristics and
the angle of the lateral aneurysmal axis to the curvature
plane of the parent vessel is obvious from the above-
mentioned studies. The in vivo studies suggest the
necessity of measuring or computing the intra-aneur-
ysmal ﬂow dynamic parameters such as the inﬂow rate,
WSS, and pressure at peak phase. Thus, the present
work focuses on characterizing the intra-aneurysmal
pulsatile ﬂow ﬁelds for lateral aneurysms arising at
various angles to the curvature plane of the parent vessel
using PTV.
2. Theoretic formulation and numerical solution
2.1. Geometry and coordinate system of calculation
domain
Fig. 1 shows that the coordinate origin was chosen at
the center of aneurysmal oriﬁce with the Z-axis directed
to the dome along the aneurysmal centerline. The curved
vessel had an inner diameter of 10mm (D) and a radius of
curvature Rm ¼ 2:5D. The diameters of the aneurysmal
oriﬁce, neck, and fundus were 1.4D, 1D, and 1.5D,
respectively, and the distance between oriﬁce and dome
measured 2D. The side-wall aneurysms arising at g ¼ 0,
451, 901, and 1351 angles to the curvature plane (Y–Z
plane) of the parent vessel were investigated. Two 60D
long straight vessels were respectively put in the upstream
and downstream of main computational domain.
2.2. Governing equations and boundary conditions
Since in larger vessels ðD40:5mmÞ such as aorta and
major arteries blood behaves more or less as a
Newtonian ﬂuid (Nagasawa, 2000), an incompressible
Newtonian ﬂuid is considered. The ﬂuid is assumed to
be homogeneous and isothermal with negligible gravity
effects. Thus, the governing equations take the following
dimensionless form:

Hence, the present study has 60D long straight tangent
sections upstream and downstream of the curved portion
of parent vessel (Fig. 2). At this selected inlet reference
station the uniform velocity uin/Umax varies sinusoidally
with time during a pulsatile cycle. When the ﬂuid ﬂow
proceeds from 60D to 3D upstream of the curved portion
of parent vessel (hereafter referred to as inlet boundary),
Fig. 4 shows that the numerical results at four selected
pulsatile phases (stars in Fig. 2) agree well with the
Womersley solutions (Womersley, 1955) based on the
sinusoidal velocity waveform (solid curves). It should be
mentioned that the inﬂow waveform used in the study was
a sine function. It is interesting to check its degree of
representation of the true ﬂow wave in the ICA (Hardesty
et al., 1960) simulated. Fig. 4 also shows such a
comparison. For the four selected phases, the Womersley
solutions based on the sinusoidal velocity waveform and
the ones based on the physiological velocity waveform
(dashed curves) in the ICA are qualitatively similar.
Quantitatively, the maximum percentage differences be-
tween the two sets of Womersley solutions at r=D ¼ 0 are
5.5%, 20.0%, 36.3%, and 11.8% for the t=T ¼ 0:20;
0:45; 0:70, and 0.95 phases, respectively. It is important to
note that the peak portion of the adopted sinusoidal wave
is more representative of the true ICA wave as depicted in
Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. Thus, the results presented below are
mostly based on the peak phase. In fact, the clinic report of
Juvela (2003) also indicated the intra-aneurysmal pressure
at peak phase was the indisputably signiﬁcant predictor of
death among patient with aneurysm rupture.
3. Experimental apparatus
The whole experimental system (Fig. 5) includes a
PTV system and a pulsatile ﬂow system. Refer to Liou
and Liou (2004) for more details. The test section was
made of 1.5mm Pyrex glass. The metallic coated
particles with a mean diameter of 4 mm and a density
of 1.6 g/cm3 were employed as the seeding particles. For
refractive index matching the working ﬂuid, about 60%
by weight solution of sodium iodine (NaI) with
r ¼ 1.73 g/cm3 and m ¼ 2:34 cp, was chosen to minimize
the curvature effect of the aneurysm and parent vessel.
The measurements were performed at a mean Re of 600
(ReM ¼ 850 and Remin ¼ 350) with a bulk velocity
Um ¼ 7:8 cm=s. The conditions selected above were to
simulate an ICA (Ferguson, 1972; Hardesty et al., 1960)
with a diameter of 5mm, a mean blood ﬂow of 40 cm/s,
and a kinematic blood viscosity of 3.5 106m2/s based
on Reynolds’ similarity rule. a was set at a value of 3.9
comparable to that adopted in the work of Gobin et al.
(1994).
It should be pointed out that the fabricated models
have a rigid wall. Fortunately, the cerebral arteries
simulated are generally stiffer than other arteries (Liou
and Liou, 2004). Thus, the radial motion of the
aneurysmal wall has only minor effects on the ﬂowﬁeld,
as has been demonstrated by Lo¨w et al. (1993).

1.1, and 0.5 for g ¼ 0, 451, 901, and 1351, respectively.
Hence, g ¼ 45, partly due to the helical ﬂow feature in a
curved parent vessel, generates the strongest secondary
ﬂow.
4.3. Inflow rate into aneurysm
In order to display the 3-D nature of the inﬂow and
outﬂow, Fig. 9 plots dimensionless W/Umax contours on
the cross-sectional plane of aneurysmal neck. It is found
that the inﬂow zone delineated by the W=Umax ¼ 0
contour (dashed line in Fig. 9) actually looks like a
curved belt with the steep velocity gradient (W/Umax
decreased from 0.85 to 0). Its shape is symmetric with
respect to X-axis and spans the 1st and 2nd quadrants
with the highest inﬂow velocities around the X-axis for
the case of g ¼ 0. As g is gradually increased to 451, 901,
and 1351, the belt-like inﬂow zone rotates clockwise and
spans the 1st, 4th and 3rd quadrants, but the highest
inﬂow-velocity zone rotates counterclockwise. Quanti-
tatively, the inﬂow zone occupies 28.2%, 31.5%, 29.4%,
and 29.4% of the neck cross-sectional area for g ¼ 0,
451, 901, and 1351, respectively. In contrast, the
corresponding outﬂow zone encloses an area about 2.2
to 2.6 times inﬂow area or about 68.5–71.8% of the neck
cross-sectional area. It should be noted that the above
observations have not been reported previously.
The inﬂow rate into the aneurysm is related to the
intra-aneurysmal ﬂow activity. For instance, the lower
the inﬂow rate is the more sluggish the intra-aneurysmal
ﬂuid ﬂow is. The stagnation of blood in the aneurysm
promotes rapid thrombosis (Brownlee et al., 2003;
Bando and Berger, 2003). Thus, the time evolutions of
the volumetric inﬂow rate (Qa/Qmax) into the aneur-
ysmal neck ð0:5oZo2:0Þ are plotted in Fig. 10. Within
a pulsatile cycle the degree of variation in Qa/Qmax has
the following sequence: g ¼ 45490404135. For
g ¼ 45 the maximal Qa=Qmax  100% into the aneur-
ysmal neck is 10%. Also note that the time evolution of
Qa/Qmax basically follows that of uin/Umax with only a
slight phase lag.
4.4. Wall shear stress and pressure
Whatever the cause of the cerebral lateral aneurysms
may be, the growth, rupture, and thrombus of an
aneurysm are strongly correlated with the hemodynamic
stresses (shear stress (friction) and pressure) exerting on
the aneurysmal wall (Strother et al., 1992; Tognetti
et al., 1983). Fig. 11 shows that the computed and
measured WSS distributions for g ¼ 45 are in good
agreement and the level of tw/(rUmax
2 ) at peak phase is
the highest. Fig. 12 further depicts a bump of tw/(rUmax
2 )
appears near distal portion G of the dome for g ¼ 45
and 901. Moreover, as pointed out by Suzuki and Ohara
(1978) that the dome wall is irregular in thickness with
extremely thin portions. In this regard, the dome region
is at risk. The result basically parallels the trend (Fig. 1)
reported by the in vivo study of Crawford (1959). On the
other hand, all values of g have the highest tw=ðrU2maxÞ
occurring around the distal oriﬁce lip. This observation
is similar to that of Steiger et al. (1987) and of Lo¨w et al.
(1993) in their rigid or elastic lateral aneurysm models of
g ¼ 0. Suzuki and Ohara (1978) in their in vivo
investigation pointed out that the blood ﬂow often
leads to the oriﬁce wall reinforced by proliferation of
intima. The oriﬁce wall is thus less at risk although it is
acted upon by the largest WSS. In general g ¼ 0 and
451 generate higher levels of shear stress distributions
than those of g ¼ 90 and 1351.
Fig. 13 compares the dimensionless intra-aneurysmal
wall pressure (Pw/rUmax
2 ) distributions. All the cases of
gexamined show uniform distributions over most of the

flow dynamic point of view, a lateral aneurysm arising from a parent vessel is similar to a
cavity in a pipe wall. The inflow rate into the aneurysm depends partly on the curvature of
the parent vessel. For a straight parent vessel the inflow into the lateral aneurysm is typically
less than 1% of the parent vessel’s volume flow rate (Li 2007) and is mainly driven by viscous
diffusion (with an approximately null inflow angle) since flow in the cerebral artery is laminar
and tangential to the aneurysmal pouch (Liou and Liao 1997a). The present study focuses
on more realistic artery curves which provide an inertia-dominated inflow into the aneurysm
(with a finite inflow angle (Liou and Liao 1997b)). Moreover, the curvature of the parent
vessel will induce helical flow that further complicates the nature of inflow. As a result,
the placement of stents in the ‘curved’ arteries harboring lateral aneurysms (figure 1) for
intravascular treatment to effectively alter the local hemodynamics, promote the formation of
thrombus inside the aneurysm, and, in turn, exclude the aneurysm from cardiac circulation
becomes more interesting and critical.
For experiments on fluid flow in the lateral aneurysm models with a curved parent vessel,
the laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements of Niimi et al (1984) concluded that the
curved arteries with an aneurysm at the outer wall (γ = 0◦) are at higher risk than those at the
inner wall (γ = 180◦) by comparing the degree of disturbance in wall shear stress in a pulsatile
cycle. Liou and Liao (1997a, 1997b) investigated the effect of parent vessel curvatures on
the intra-aneurysmal flow features using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). They found that
the intra-aneurysmal flow velocity, vorticity and WSS increased with increasing curvature
of the parent vessel. For numerical studies, Liou et al (2007) attempted to identify the riskiest
aneurysmal angle γ on a curved parent vessel from hemodynamics viewpoint by using an
in-house three-dimensional (3D) finite volume method. In their study the degree of the risk
was defined in terms of the relative magnitudes of the intra-aneurysmal main flow vortex
strength, secondary flow strength, volumetric inflow rate (flow activity), WSS and wall static
pressure. It is found that among the γ = 0◦, 45◦, 90◦ and 135◦, γ = 45◦ is the riskiest angle
followed by γ = 90◦. Moreover, the aneurysmal dome is the riskiest region from all cases
investigated.

shows that the side-wall aneurysm arose at an angle of γ = 45◦ from the curvature plane of
the parent vessel. The diameters of the aneurysmal orifice, neck and fundus were l = 1.4D,
n = 1D and f = 1.5D, respectively, and the distance between orifice and dome measured
h = 2D. The helical stent depicted in figure 1(c) was 15 mm (L) long. Its porosity defined
as Cα(%) = 1 − (N • d/L) had values of 100% (unstented), 90%, 80%, 70%, 50% and
30%. N and d are the number of pitches and the diameter of the stent filament (d = 250 µm),
respectively.
2.2. Mathematical formulation
The hemodynamics in the intracranial artery examined is considered to be Newtonian since in
larger vessels (D > 0.5 mm), such as aorta and major arteries, blood behaves more or less as
a Newtonian fluid (Nichols and O’Rourke 1990). However, the non-Newtonian flow behavior
should be considered in the next phase of study since it may change the flow at bends and in
the aneurysm, especially in low shear regions, even in larger blood vessels. It is also assumed
that the fluid is incompressible, homogeneous and isothermal with negligible gravity effects.
In the mass and momentum conservation equations (Liou et al 2007), the inlet maximal
velocity Umax of the parent vessel, ρU 2max, radius D/2 of the parent vessel and physiological
pulsation period T = 0.732 s are selected as the characteristic scales for nondimensionalizing
the velocity components, pressure, spatial coordinates and time t, respectively. The
relevant dimensionless parameters are ReM = (ρUmaxD/µ), the maximal Reynolds number
(figure 2), and α = D/2√ω/ν , the Womersley number. ρ is the density (1050 kg m−3),
µ is the dynamic viscosity (3.5 cP), ν is the kinematic viscosity (3.3 × 10−6 m2 s−1) and
ω = 2π/T is the angular frequency of the pulsation.
Figure 2 shows the one-period Q waveform (Cebral et al 2001, 2004, Marshall et al 2004).
Q is the pulsatile volume flow rate over the cross-section of the inlet reference station. The
corresponding Wormersley solution is specified at 3D upstream tangent of the curved parent
vessel (figure 1(a)). For the outlet boundary conditions at 3D downstream tangent of the

Based on Reynolds and Wormersley similarity rules, the investigated parent vessel model with
a diameter of 10 mm is intended to simulate ICA having a diameter of 5 mm. Human blood
kinematic viscosity is 3.3 × 10−6 m2 s−1 (Bando and Berger 2003). The human heartbeat is
postulated at 82 bpm. Thus, the Womersley number is 4.0.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Comparisons between numerical and experimental results—main flow patterns
in the Y ∗ = 0 plane
Both computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and experimental (PIV/FV) results show consistent
overall flow patterns for the unstented and stented intra-aneurysmal flow velocity vector fields
in the Y ∗ = 0 plane at the t/T = 0.20 peak phase of figure 2, as demonstrated in figure 4.
The inflow and outflow enters and exits the aneurysm at the distal and proximal lips of the
pore, respectively. Relative to the unstented case (figure 4(a)), the intra-aneurysmal flow
velocities for the stented case of Cα = 70% (figure 4(b)) are markedly reduced. A quantitative
comparison between the computed and measured distributions of X and Z directional velocity
components (i.e. U and W) in the X–Z plane for the unstented case is given in figure 5. The
examined distributions are along the +Z axis (X∗ = 0, figure 1(a)) inside the aneurysm and
across the aneurysmal ostium (Z∗ = 0, figure 1(a)). A reasonable agreement within 3% of
Umax is attained. Along the +Z axis figure 5(a) shows the stagnation of the fluid flow above
Z∗ = 1.0. Across the aneurysmal ostium figure 5(b) reveals nearly null-value W/Umax,
suggesting that the inflow into the aneurysm of γ = 45◦ is practically not along the X–Z plane.
A discussion relevant to this observation will be continued when cross-sectional secondary
flow patterns are presented.

plots the time evolution of the dimensionless volume inflow rate Qan into the aneurysmal neck
for the values of Cα examined. The trends basically follow that of figure 2 with only a slight
phase lag. For the unstented case (Cα = 100%) Qan has a maximum value of 15.3% of the
parent vessel’s maximum flow rate Qmax. Note that this is about 15 times the inflow rate of the
straight vessel case (Liou et al 2007). The reason has been mentioned in the Introduction. That
is, the main flow of the straight parent vessel is approximately tangential to the aneurysmal
orifice and thus has nearly null inflow angle. After stenting, the peak phase shifts about 0.1 T
ahead, and the maximum Qan/Qmax for Cα = 90%, 80%, 70%, 50% and 30% are reduced
to 12%, 9.8%, 6.4%, 2.2% and 0.8%, respectively. It is worth pointing out that Yu and
Zhao (1999) found that the maximum flow velocity Uo (X-velocity components) inside the
aneurysmal pouch of a stented (Cα = 35%) sidewall aneurysm can be suppressed to about 3%
to 5% of the bulk mean velocity Uv of the parent vessel based on their PIV measurements of
the steady flow fields. In the present study the maximum dimensionless flow velocity Uo/Uv
can be suppressed to less than 12% for Cα = 30%.

Figure 8. Total volume inflow rates across the neck Qan over one cardiac cycle (Z-velocity
components in figures 4 and 6) as a function of Cα (Qan 0 = Qan of unstented case).
It should also be pointed out that the porosities of one layer, two layers, and three
layers of commercial stents (Serruys and Rensing 2002) approximately correspond to Cα =
80%, 60% and 40%, respectively. As mentioned in the Introduction, the intracranial stents
that are currently used are highly porous, and Benndorf et al (2001) had demonstrated a
successful treatment of a cerebral sidewall aneurysm using two overlapping stents of Cα =
62% to accelerate intra-aneurysmal thrombosis. Figure 8 shows that the total volume inflow
rates over a cardiac cycle across the aneurysmal neck Qan of Cα = 80%, 60% and 40% are,
respectively, about 52%, 22% and 10% of the unstented case Qan 0. It seems that the three-
layer stents are not as effective as two-layer stents in reducing the volume inflow rate into the
aneurysm.
4.4. Effects of Cα on intra-aneurysmal pressure and WSS at peak phase
Bando and Berger (2003) reported that the pressure on the inner wall of the cerebral aneurysm
is almost uniform except near the proximal and distal pouch due to the effect of the stent
insertion. At a peak flow rate phase figure 9 shows a slight decrease of the mean wall pressure
Pw/Pw0 with decreasing Cα, where Pw and Pw0 are the wall pressures of the stented and
unstented case averaged over the intra-aneurysmal wall. However, the extent of the decrease
is limited to 3% of the unstented case.
WSS can be calculated from the near wall tangential velocity profile via equation (3)
and is the frictional force of viscous blood acting on the intra-aneurysmal wall. Endothelial
cells lining the inner lumen of aneurysms are constantly being exposed to cyclic frictional
WSSs and hydrostatic pressures. Figure 9 plots the dimensionless WSS averaged over the
intra-aneurysmal wall versus stent porosity. Two observations can be made. First, the level
of τw
/(
ρU 2max
)
relative to the unstented case τw0
/(
ρU 2max
) (Cα = 100%) is found to decrease
exponentially with decreasing Cα. Or, as the stent porosity is decreased, τw/τw0 is reduced
from 100% (Cα = 100%) to 38% (Cα = 90%), 18% (Cα = 80%, one layer), 5% (Cα =
70%), 3% (Cα = 60%, two layers), 1% (Cα = 50%), 0.25% (Cα = 40%, three layers) and

Figure 11. Wall shear stress distributions along the intra-aneurysmal wall of the Y ∗ = 0 plane for
various stent porosities at a peak flow rate phase (γ = 45◦, ReM = 384 and α = 4.0).
Locally, Cooke et al (1990) and Malek et al (1999) had shown that when endothelial
cells (EC) are subjected to a strong WSS (>1.5 Pa), the amount of nitric oxide (NO) secreted
increases significantly leading to an inhibition of EC growth, which consequently inhibits
thrombus formation. Conversely, EC reacts to low SS (<0.5 Pa) by releasing adenosine di-
and triphosphate to induce macroscopic platelet aggregation (Brown et al 1975, Benard et al
2003). In a study of stented cerebral artery, Bando and Berger (2003) also pointed out that the
evaluation of the thrombus formation can be performed by examining the wall shear rate of
blood flow, that is the thrombus is generated markedly when the dimensional wall shear rate
is smaller than 100 s−1 (or WSS < 0.4 Pa). Figure 11 depicts wall shear stress distributions
along the intra-aneurysmal wall of the Y ∗ = 0 plane for the stent porosities investigated at a
peak flow rate phase. It is observed that the magnitude of τw
/(
ρU 2max
)
is reduced significantly
for the distal lip portion (abscissa: 0 to 0.2) after stenting. Moreover, WSSs of the entire
intra-aneurysmal wall are less than the critical value 1.5 Pa of thrombus inhibition when
Cα  70%. Hence, stent insertion tends to provide a more thrombogenic environment inside
the aneurysm. Also note that the values of WSS are below the critical value 0.5 Pa of extreme
thrombus formation for almost 80% (abscissa: 0 to 0.8) of the intra-aneurysmal wall when the
overlap of double (Cα = 60%) or triple (Cα = 40%) stents is used.
5. Conclusions
(1) The computed intra-aneurysmal velocity-component/wall shear stress distributions and
flow patterns are found to be in reasonable agreement with the PIV measured and flow
visualized results.
(2) For the unstented case, the maximum inflow rate into the sidewall aneurysm arising at
γ = 45◦ from the curved parent vessel is found to be about 15% of the parent vessel
maximum flow rate. This value is approximately 15 times that of the previously reported
straight vessel case.
(3) For the stented case, the maximum flow velocity inside the aneurysm ostium can be
suppressed to less than 12% of the bulk mean velocity of the curved parent vessel. This
