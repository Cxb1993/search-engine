1. Introduction 
 
    Ultrafiltration membrane process has now become an increasingly important 
industrial process for the concentration, purification, or dewatering of macromolecular 
and colloidal species in solution; it is usually used in the food, beverage, and dairy 
industries, for effluent treatment, and biotechnology and medical applications [1-3]. 
The advantage of ultrafiltration as compared to conventional dewatering processes, 
such as evaporation, freeze concentration or freeze drying, is the absence of a change 
in phase or state of the solvent during dewatering process, resulting in considerable 
savings in energy. 
    Ultrafiltration is primarily a size-exclusion-based, pressure-driven membrane 
separation process; the pressure applied to the working fluid provides the potential to 
force the solvent to flow through the membrane. During operation, solute is 
transported to the membrane surface by the convective flow of the permeant; this is 
balanced by diffusion back to the bulk. In cross-flow ultrafiltration the permeate flux 
generally declines along the flow direction due to the phenomenon of concentration 
polarization by the rejected particles, which is a common feature of all 
pressure-driven membrane processes [4]. Several hydraulic approaches developed 
for reducing the effect of concentration polarization to enhance the permeate flux, 
Although the osmotic pressure at the membrane surface also affects the permeate flux, 
ultrafiltration usually deals with the separation of fairly large molecules and the 
osmotic pressures involved in ultrafiltration processes are fairly low and negligible. 
According to above description of ultrafiltration in the resistance-in-series model, 
permeate flux J(z) may be expressed as 
pfm RRR
)(P)(J ++
Δ= zz                                                  (1) 
where Rm denotes the intrinsic resistance, and Rp and Rf are the resistances due to the 
concentration/gel layer and those due to other fouling phenomena such as adsorption, 
respectively, while ΔP(z) is the transmembrane pressure defined as 
sPP(z)P(z) −=Δ                                                     (2) 
In above equation, P(z) is the pressure distribution of the tube side along the axial 
direction z, and Ps is the permeate pressure of the shell side which may be assumed to 
be constant. 
    As mentioned before , concentration polarization is a common feature of all 
pressure-driven membrane processes. It is dependent on operating parameter such as 
pressure, temperature, feed concentration and velocity, and increases along the 
membrane tube. Accordingly, we may assume that for constant operating temperature  
( ) P(z) R p Δ= zβ                                                      (3) 
where J  is the average value of J(z) defined as 
∫= L 0 dz J(z) L1J                                                      (9) 
2.3. Momentum balance 
 
    Since the permeation rate of membrane ultrafiltration is very small compared 
with the volume flow rate in a membrane tube, it can be assumed that the local decline 
in hydraulic pressure within the membrane tube is simply given by the 
Hagen-Poiseuille equation in term of average volume flow rate Q  [10]

3. Experimental 
 
3.1. Apparatus and materials 
 
    The experimental apparatus used in this work is shown in Fig. 1. The membrane 
medium used was mainly 40 kDa MWCO tubular ceramic membrane (Carbsep, 
length L =0.4 m, inside diameter 2rm = 6×10-3 m). The tested solute was dextran T500 
(Pharmacia Co.). The solvent was distillated water. The feed solution was circulated 
ultrafiltration Jw, for determining the intrinsic resistance of the membrane. Next, the 
steady permeate fluxes of liquid solution at the ten outlets, zj = [2+4(j-1)]×10-2 m, j = 
1~10, were measured under various Ci, Qi, and iPΔ . After each experimental run, the 
membrane was cleaned by the methods of high circulation and backflushing with 10% 
NaOH solution, 10% HNO3 solution and water. The cleaning procedure was repeated 
until the original water flux has been restored. Many experimental data were obtained 
and some of them are listed in Tables 1-5. 
 
3.3. Determination of Rm and Rf 
 
    The experimental data of the average permeate fluxes for pure water ( wJ )exp and 
solution ( J )exp are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. With the use of Table 1, a 
straight line of ( wJ1 )exp versus ( P1 Δ )exp could be constructed by the least-square 
method. Thus, the intrinsic resistance of the membrane tube employed in this study 
can be determined from Table 1 by using the following equation which can be 
modified from Eq. (1) by setting Rf = 0 and Rp = 0 for pure-water ultrafiltration 
( ) ( )expmexpw PRJ 1 Δ=                                                     (28) 
In above equation the average transmembrane pressure may be estimated by taking

3.4. Determination of iβ  and α  
 
    Again, if the experimental data for the local permeate flux , J(z) , in Tables 4 and 
5 and transmembrane pressure , ΔP(z), are applied to Eq. (1)  coupled with the use of 
Eq.(3) , P(z)(z)R p Δ= β , then

where, according to the linear decline of transmembrane pressure shown in Eq. (14) 
)Lz(])P()P([)P(P(z)][ expoexpiexpiexp Δ−Δ−Δ=Δ                            (35) 
Some values of (z)β  obtained from Eq. (34) with known values of (Rm+Rf), [J(z)]exp 
and [ P(z)Δ ]exp , are also listed in Tables 4 and 5. Therefore, from a straight-line plot 
of )(ξβ  versus ξ  at a certain flow velocity ui and feed concentration Ci , as shown 
in Fig. 3, the experimental values of iβ  (the intersection at the ordinate) and αβ i  
(the slope) were determined graphically, according to Eq. (4). Finally, the correlation 
equations for iβ  and α  were constructed as

(30) , (32) and (33) , and are also plotted in these figures. It is seen that the modified 
resistance-in-series model with the variable concentration-polarization resistance, 
)P()(1R ip ξαξβ Δ+=  , is more precisely applicable than the conventional 
resistance-in-series model [5,6],

in which the term of concentration-polarization resistance, )P(R p ξφΔ=  , is nearly 
unchanged but slightly declined along the tube, as also shown in Figs. 7 and 8.  
 
4.2. Concentration polarization increment 
 
    The decline of permeate flux along the cross-flow direction is mainly due to the 
decrease of transmembrane pressure )P(ξΔ  (driving force) and the increase of 
concentration polarization )(R p ξ  (resistance). Figs. 7 and 8 show the variations of 
)(R p ξ  along the flow direction, with the traditional model defined in previous works 
[5, 6], ( )ξφ PΔ , and with the modified model defined in present study, 
( ) ( )ξαξβ Pi Δ+1 . It is obvious that the traditional model gives the incorrect 
description of )(R p ξ , decreasing, instead of increasing, along the membrane tube. 
The correct definition of )(R p ξ  by Eq. (5) does increase in the cross-flow direction, 
pressures and feed flow rates. Correlation predictions are compared with the 
experimental results, as shown in Figs. 4-6. It is found that the correlation predictions 
of local permeate flux obtained from present modified resistance-in-series model are 
more accurate than those obtained from the conventional resistance-in-series model [5, 
6] , in which the concentration-polarization resistance was described by an incorrect 
term, )P(ξφΔ  , decreasing slightly along the tube, while in present study, the 
increment of concentration polarization, )P()(1i ξαξβ Δ+  , through the tube was 
taken into consideration, resulting in the correct decline of permeate flux, as 
confirmed by experiments. Therefore, the present model easily described the 
relationships of the decline of permeate flux with operating and design parameters, 
and we believe that this model will also suitable for most membrane ultrafiltration 
systems including systems with different kinds of feed solutions, different materials of 
membrane tubes, and various design and operating conditions.
