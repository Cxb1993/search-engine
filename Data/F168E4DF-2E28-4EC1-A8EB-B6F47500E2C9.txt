Abstract
This project proposes the enhancement of power system
stability by means of flexible ac transmission systems
(FACTS) technology. Consequently, a different network
configuration can be obtained immediately. In addition,
justification analysis will be executed multiple FACTS
devices embedded in a multi-machine power system.
Control strategies would also be developed for these
conditions in this project. Finally, comprehensive
computer simulations will be given to testify the
proposed proposal.
Key Words: Power system stability, Transient stability,

二.緣由與目的
2.1 Power System Transient Stability
Power system will undergo a period of time of electro-
mechanical transient behaviour after a contingency
occurred in the grid. This electromechanical transient
can be further divided into two phases; which are
transient and steady-state stability. Transient stability
usually concerns the first swing stability [GS 1994]. And
the model used to investigate the first swing stability is
that of the classical, two-order swing model [GS 1994].
2.2 Transient Stability Enhancement by FACTS
Many countermeasures for power system transient
stability concern the special protection scheme such as
load shedding or generator tripping. These methods have
shown to be effective and feasible. For generator that
had been tripped, it might take several days to start up
[ 梁 2002]. They are, however, rather expensive and
highly cost. It would be worthy for power utilities to
find a method to enhance the transient stability if they
are not bound to use the special protection schemes such
as generator tripping or load shedding.
This project investigates the use of FACTS technique to
enhance power system transient stability. Although
there were some researches had been studied on this
issue, to the author best knowledge, they were
considering only one FACTS device [E 1991], [H 2004],
[LAP 1998]. Even with the exception paper by [LL 1999]
which considered more than one FACTS device, they
were still in vicinity of generators. In the event that
FACTS devices were embedded in the centre of the grid,
the issue of how to coordinate them in such a manner
that can enhance power system transient stability is sill
lack in related researches. Thus, the aim of this project is
to sever this end.
三.研究方法與成果
3.1 Principle of the proposed approach
The fundamental principle of the proposed method is the
swing equation. From the following equation, it is
known that the imbalance of mechanical power and
electrical power will cause the generator start to increase
the power angle and to swing.
delivering more active power, this in turn implies that
can help the mth generator transient stability. On the
contrary, if the value of Smn is negative, it indicates that
the nth FACTS device’s deviation can cause mth generator
delivering less active power, this in turn implies that can
not help the mth generator transient stability.
3.3 Test System
In this project we utilise the 10 generators power system
as our test system, which is shown in Figure 1. Four
TSCSs have been embedded in the test system as shown
in Figure 1. The TCSC compensation information is
illustrated in Table 1. Meanwhile, Table 2 denotes the
sensitivity matrix that was calculated according to the
formula shown in the last section.
3.4 Nonlinear Simulations
Consider a three-phase ground fault occurred in Bus 14,
and the fault duration is 0.189 seconds. Also assume that
after fault cleared, the power system grid structure is the
same with the original one, which means that both post-
fault and pre-fault power system topologies are identical.
With the contingency considered above, the power
system generators’swing curves are shown in Figure 2. It
demonstrates that all the generators swing away and lose
stability.
However, if we consider TCSC2 compensation 70%,
together with the same contingency, the power system
generators’swing curves are shown in Figure 3. It shows
that the whole system is stabilised. While with the
compensation offered by TCSC4 with 70%, the swing
curves of all system generators are shown in Figure 4,
which indicates the unstable case. This tells that the
compensation offered by TCSC4 doesn’t work very well
in comparison with TCSC2, even though the amount of
TCSC2 compensation is less then TCSC4. The reason is
that TCSC4 only provide effectiveness with respect to
generator G9, according to the sensitivity matrix S, while
TCSC2 can provide positive response to generator G1
and G3.
Another case study is considering a three-phase fault
occurred in the vicinity of bus 36. The fault duration is
0.116 seconds. Without any TCSC compensation, Figure
5 tells that all power system generators swing away,
particular generator G1, G3 and G10. If we insert TCSC1
with 70% capacitive compensation, Figure 6 shows that
the whole system lose its stability. While with the
consideration of TCSC2 with 70% compensation, it is
shown from Figure 7 that the power system transient
stability can be maintained.
四.結果與討論
1. The proposed algorithm can be treat as a
complementary in cooperation with conventional
transient stability enhancement methods such as
generator tripping and load shedding.
2. It can consider energy-stored devices such as SMES
(Superconducting Magnetic Energy Systems) to
enlarge the electrical power, PE. We can use
FACTS technology to guide the active power so
that most of the electrical power can be saved in
SMES.
3. We can associate the proposed method with the
critical machine concept developed by [RP 2003]
to identify which generators are critical. And one
can check the sensitivity matrix accordingly.
五.計畫成果
The result is organised to be published in the near
future.
