the dynamic mathematical model of the 
pressed roller. Lastly, a new Bending 
Roller Control System is adopted to 
control the deformation of pressed roller, 
in order to make the fabric surface to 
receive even pressure, and in turn, 
enhance the calendaring quality.  
These deflection and vibration are 
able to cause non-uniform and 
non-flatness of fabric performance and 
damage for roller, thus several attempts 
have been made to solve above 
problems. A traditional technology to 
remove deformation of roller is 
introduced in [1]. In this project, 
bending forces applied by hydraulic 
actuation system are placed between 
extended necks of the rollers to get 
torques to deflect the deformed roller. 
Increasing dimension of machine and 
giving poor response performance are 
disadvantages of this proposal. Another 
way is presented in [2,3], where a force 
is put outside and at the middle of the 
roller length. The method is simple to 
implement; nevertheless, it is only 
useful for application where roller has 
small diameter and strong outside 
surface. Next, the conventional rollers 
are usually made from steel material, 
this kind of material will give some 
drawbacks for designing, manufacturing 
roller and processing fabric. 
Additionally, in the previous papers, 
mathematic models of the roller system 
are frequently based on Bernoulli-Euler 
equation and Rayleigh’s method. These 
methods are only appropriate for a few 
of the rollers which have thin thickness 
layers, high ratio between length and 
diameter of roller. Proportional Integrate 
Derivative (PID) and phase Lead-Lag 
controller applied to the BRCS are 
expressed in [2-5]. These methods are 
used by their simple characteristics in 
design and manufacture but these 
characteristics lead to limited control 
performance.  
In this project, to get more high 
accuracy of the model, a new 
mathematic model for the roller has 
been proposed based on Timoshenko 
beam theory which considers the 
effective of shear force when analysis 
the structure of the roller [6-14]. 
Moreover, the structure of roller 
includes inner steel and outer nylon 
layers. This kind of roller can combine 
good characteristics and suppress 
drawbacks of steel and nylon. MPC 
method bases on a linear model, optimal 
algorithm and quadratic cost function to 
obtain control trajectory action at each 
sample time by solving online 
optimization problem in systematic way 
[15-22]. The BRCS requires very high 
force and first time derivative of force; 
however, the power of actuator system is 
limited. Therefore, a constrained model 
predictive controller is proposed to solve 
the above problems. Furthermore, the 
multi-cylinder actuator is installed inside 
the roller to improve the magnitude and 
the first time derivative of force. This 
scheme helps not only to obtain desired 
displacement but also to better dynamic

Thick of nylon layer (mm)  
Figure 2 Express the variation of 
fundamental frequency when increasing 
the thickness of nylon layer. 
The next purposed simulation was 
carried out in order to demonstrate the 
effective of nylon and steel materials. 
These materials are frequently provided 
to manufacture roller layers. In this 
illumination, the length, inner and outer 
of roller are fixed. First, it is assumed 
that the roller only made from steel 
material, and then the thickness of nylon 
is increased with direction from outside 
to inside surface of the roller. Figure 2 
has shown the variation of the FF of 
roller when reducing the thickness of 
steel layer and simultaneously 
increasing the thickness of nylon layer. 
It is easy to see that the roller made from 
only nylon requests bending force 
entirely lower than the steel roller is. 
Besides, the nylon is softer and has 
smaller mass density. These 
characteristics give more advantages for 
processing fabric, designing, 
manufacturing and maintaining roller, 
and saving energy in operation. 
However, the nylon roller is easily 
damaged, torn or destroyed when 
receiving great external forces. 
Therefore the combined roller made by 
inner steel and outer nylon layer with 
suitable thickness of these materials is a 
good choice.

Velocity of the roller (rpm)  
Figure 3 Relationship between the 
roller velocity and fundamental 
frequency. 
 
Figure 3 shows the simulation 
results in order to demonstrate the effect 
of roller velocity with FF. In this figure, 
the FF has a large variation in the high 
velocity; nevertheless, when velocity of 
roller varies from 0 to 300 rpm, the 
variation of FF is rather small.

Figure 5 Investigate the variation of 
constrained force when changing the 
number of cylinders in the 
multi-cylinder system. (a) Dynamic 
response displacement. (b) The 
constrained force applied by each 
cylinder. (c) The first time derivative of 
constrained force 
Secondly, Figure 5 shows 
simulation results with the first time 
derivative and the magnitude of control 
force constraints. The number cylinders 
varied sequential 3, 7 and 15 cylinders, 
the maximum bending force of each 
cylinder was 3.5x10

 N while the 
maximum first time derivative of force 
was 2.2x10
5
 N/s and the minimum was 
-1.5x10
5
 N/s. It is easy to see that when 
multi-cylinder system had 3 cylinders, 
the total force was not enough to gain 
set point displacement 1 mm. This case 
gave poor dynamic response 
performance because the undesired 
oscillation occurred at the output of 
system. When using 7 or 15 cylinders, 
the total forces were large enough to 
derive the desired displacement, give 
high dynamic response performance of 
system and the multi-cylinder system 
with 15 cylinders had better dynamic 
response performance when comparing 
with the multi-cylinder system had 7 
cylinders.

Conclusions 
This study set out to show that the 
new model of a combined roller based 
on Timoshenko beam theory is more 
accuracy and reliability. The second 
useful major of this study proved that 
using a multi-hydraulic cylinder system 
and putting it inside roller can overcome 
limited power of bending hydraulic 
actuation system, increase the magnitude 
and the first time derivative of bending 
force. Therefore, not only putting up the 
range of desired displacement, but even 
decreasing so fast the transient time of 
dynamic response. Finally, constrained 
DMPC with great properties is suitable 
effectiveness not only to control and 
improve the dynamic response 
performance but also open wide the 
operation range of the BRCS.

技術說明
(中文) 織物經過壓光處理可以得到更細緻的接觸手感與表面光澤，常使用於高附價 
價值的紡織成品中。壓光機藉由滾輪組對織物同時加熱並施予壓力，以改變織物 
表面型態與對光的反射。在壓光過程中，滾輪組中的壓光滾輪施以壓力於織物上，
 
而受壓滾輪做為支承以保持對織物的壓力，但受壓滾輪因承受壓力而產生變形， 
導致織物與滾輪接觸時壓力不均，使壓光成品產生色差等瑕疵。使織物均勻的受 
壓為壓光之關鍵技術，本計畫開發新型壓光機主動內壓式滾輪變形控制系統，於 
受壓滾輪內裝置主動式液壓模組，其包含伺服液壓系統及接觸滾輪。在學理研究 
上，受壓滾輪可視為連續式系統，以此架構推導受壓滾輪之動態數學模型，以數 
值模擬與實際運作驗證受壓滾輪的動態數學模型，最後導入模型預測控制器以控 
制受壓滾輪的變形，目的使織物表面可受到均勻的壓光壓力，提高織物壓光品
