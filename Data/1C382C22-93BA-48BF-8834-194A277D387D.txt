Abstract
ZnO nanorod arrays (ZNAs) with various degrees of density and vertical alignment were grown on ZnO/Si substrates by a hydro-
thermal approach containing ZnO seed layers with designed microstructural characteristics. The nucleation mechanisms of ZNAs
and the eﬀect of the seed layers on the density and vertical alignment of ZNAs were systematically studied. Grain size and surface rough-
ness were demonstrated to compete as the dominating characteristics for nucleation resulting in ZNAs with variable density and vertical
alignment. Experimental results reveal that the nucleation mechanism of ZNAs switches from grain-boundary nucleation to surface
nucleation when the characteristics of the seed layer change from small grains and low surface roughness to large grains and high surface
roughness. Grain-boundary nucleation results in ZNAs with high rod density and poor vertical alignment. In contrast, surface-nucleat-
ing ZNAs possess low rod density and excellent vertical alignment of rods.

1. Introduction
One-dimensional (1-D), high-density semiconductor
nanostructures have been extensively studied for their appli-
cation in electronic and photonic devices [1]. One such struc-
ture, zinc oxide, which possesses a wide band gap (3.37 eV)
semiconductor, is of potential in a wide range of applica-
tions, such as solar cellc [2], sensorc [3–5] and optoelectronic
devices. A 1-D nanostructure can be easily prepared with
various catalysts, such as Au [1–7], Co [8], NiO [9] and Sn
[10], via the vapor–liquid–solid epitaxial method. Other
methods, such as chemical vapor deposition [11] and
metal–organic chemical vapor deposition [12,13] have also
been extensively employed in fabricating 1-D ZnO nano-
structures. Recently, the hydrothermalmethod has attracted
much attention because of its lower reaction temperature,
which enables nanorods to be grown on ﬂexible substrates
[14]. Moreover, the hydrothermal method is a cost-eﬀective
process due to its simple equipment and easy scale up. To
reduce the lattice mismatch during the growth of ZnO nano-
rod arrays (ZNAs) in the hydrothermal method, a seed layer
(such as GaN and ZnO) is usually deposited on the substrate
to control the characteristics, such as the density and vertical
alignment, of the resultant nanorods. Various mechanisms
have been discussed elsewhere [14–24], yet the conclusion
is still controversial. Nanorods have been reported to nucle-
ate either on the surface [15–23] or on the grain-boundary
area [14,24] of the seed layer. However, the conditions under
which each individual mechanism dominates have not been
determined. To clarify this, various seed layers with a wide
range of grain sizes and surface roughnesses were prepared
by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering under diﬀerent
sputtering gases. In addition, the sputtered seed layers were
annealed at elevated temperatures to produce a wider distri-
bution of grain sizes and surface roughnesses. In this article
we report the conditions where each nucleation mechanism
dominates and we also demonstrate that the characteristics
of ZNAs are determined by the type of the nucleation
mechanism.

grown on the AO seed layers because the surface roughness
increases with increasing grain size, as shown in Fig. 3i. If
surface nucleation is the dominant mechanism, the rod
density of ZNAs should increase with increasing grain size
of the seed layer. The surface roughness (RMS) and the
rod’s density are plotted in the inset of Fig. 3i. The plot
indicates that the density of nanorods reduces with the
grain size. Another characteristic of ZNAs grown on the
AO seed layers is the poor vertical alignment of the nano-
rods. The nanorods grow mostly in directions that are
tilted from the seed layer.
Images of the ZNAs with the time of growth extending
from 3 to 10 h are shown in Fig. 3e–h. The tilt of the
nanorods from the c-axis does not improve with growth
time. After 10 h of growth time, the ZnO rod density also
decreases with the grain size of the AO seed layer. The
average ZnO rod diameter and height increase with the
grain size of the AO seed layer, as shown in the insets of
Fig. 3e–h. The data for the ZNAs grown for 10 h are
shown in Fig. 3j. The higher growth rate of the ZnO nano-
rods in the larger grained seed layer is due to the lower rod
density. The average concentration of Zn2+ and OH
around each rod is higher during ZNAs growth, which
results in a higher growth rate of ZnO rods.
The characteristics of the ZNAs grown on the A seed
layers are very diﬀerent from those grown on the AO seed

coalescence. Increasing the rod density causes faster con-
sumption of Zn2+ and OH ions in the solution, which
results in the decrease in rod height.
Fig. 5 shows the XRD patterns of ZNAs grown on AO
and A seed layers. The ZNAs grown on the AO seed layers
exhibit a broad (0 0 2) peak and a weak (1 0 1) peak. In con-
trast, those grown on the A seed layers show only a much
narrower (0 0 2) peak. The vertical alignment of the ZNAs
grown on theA seed layers and the single narrow (0 0 2) peak
reveals that the growth direction of the ZnO nanorods is
(0 0 2). The XRD results of the ZNAs grown on the AO seed
layers can be explained by the oblique growth of (0 0 2) ZnO
nanorods; this oblique growth causes the broad (0 0 2) peak.
The appearance of the (1 0 1) peak implies that the maximal
oblique angle is roughly the angle between the (0 0 2) plane
and the (1 0 1) plane, which is 32.

[28]. This indicates that ZNAs grown on the AO and A
seed layers in this investigation possess excellent quality.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, ZnO nanorod arrays with various degrees
of density and vertical alignment were grown on Si sub-
strates with a ZnO seed layer which possesses pre-designed
microstructural characteristics by a hydrothermal method.
Experimental results demonstrate that grain size and sur-
face roughness compete as the dominating characteristic
for nucleation of ZNAs. Experimental results reveal that
the dominating nucleation mechanism of ZNAs switches
from grain-boundary nucleation to surface nucleation
when the characteristics of the seed layer change from
small grains and low surface roughness to large grains
and high surface roughness. Grain-boundary nucleation
results in ZNAs with high rod density and poor vertical
alignment, while surface-nucleating ZNAs possesses low
rod density and excellent vertical alignment of rods.

Abstract
We report the synthesis, morphology, and magnetization characteristics of BiFeO3
(BFO)-covered ZnO nanorod arrays (ZNAs). High quality and well-aligned ZNAs were grown
by a hydrothermal method. BFO shells were deposited by sputtering at ambient temperature
and then annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. The BFO shells crystallized to form a perovskite
structure at 450 ◦C. Scanning electron microscopy and high resolution transmission electron
microscopy demonstrated that the BFO shell was polycrystalline and randomly oriented,
covering the ZnO nanorods well. The magnetization–magnetic field loops measured at 5 and
300 K indicate that the BFO/ZNA hetero-structure exhibits ferromagnetic order. The BFO/ZNA
displays enhanced coercivity and saturated magnetization as compared with BFO thin films.

1. Introduction
Recently, it has been shown that one-dimensional ferroelectric
nanorods, nanowires, and nanotubes with a high aspect ratio
have high potential for practical applications in nanogener-
ators [1] and ferroelectric random access memories [2, 3].
Hydrothermal methods were frequently used to prepare nanos-
tructures [4–7]; however, they were generally used to produce
nanopowders and various nanostructures in solution. No
nanoferroelectrics were fabricated by hydrothermal methods
on substrates in an autoclave environment. Ferroelectric
core/shell nanostructures were fabricated on templates using
other methods such as physical vapor deposition, the sol–gel
method, and metalorganic chemical vapor deposition [2, 8–13].
There are negative templates as well as positive templates.
Porous Si and Al2O3 have been used extensively as negative
templates to form ferroelectric nanostructures through post-
heat treatment. However, damages of nanostructures usually
occur in the etching procedure in removing templates. Typical
positive templates include Si nanowires or ZnO nanorods.
Ferroelectrics can be deposited on positive templates by vapor
deposition [9, 10, 13], plasma deposition [2], and chemical
solution deposition [3, 12] to form a core/shell structure. Thus,
ZnO nanorod is an excellent choice of positive template to
synthesize core/shell nanostructures by hydrothermal methods.
Due to its unique electronic, optical, and piezoelectric
properties [14], ZnO nanowires/nanobelts have been success-
fully applied in field effect transistors [15], light-emitting
diodes [16], laser diodes [17], sensors [18], resonators [19],
solar cells [20], and piezoelectric devices [21, 22]. ZnO has
emerged as a candidate semiconductor for direct integration
with ferroelectric materials [23] due to its chemical stability
and compatibility with ferroelectric oxides.
BiFeO3 (BFO) is one of the well known room temperature
multiferroic materials with coexistence of ferroelectric and
antiferromagnetic orders. It was reported to exhibit a
diode-like behavior and substantial visible-light photovoltaic
effects due to its small optical gap edge of 2.2 eV [24].
Utilization of small-optical-bandgap ferroelectrics with good
carrier transport properties and large absorption of visible light
extending into the red range is a promising route toward novel
optoelectronic applications. BFO exhibits a rhombohedral R3c

exhibits high density ZnO nanorods with excellent alignment.
BFO shells grown on these two ZNAs are shown in figures 1(c)
and (d). Figure 1(c) reveals that poorly aligned nanorods
show a swollen shape (indexed by black circles). In
contrast, the well-aligned nanorods display uniform and better
covering of BFO shells (indexed by red circles). This
demonstrates that the alignment of ZnO nanorods is an
important factor for BFO shells to grow. Figure 1(d) shows
the image of BFO grown on high density and well-aligned
ZNA. The BFO shells appear to merge together due to the
small spacing left among ZnO nanorods, which hinders the
formation of individual BFO/ZnO core–shell hetero-structures.
Accordingly, appropriate alignment and nanorod density are
required for preparing individual BFO/ZnO core–shell hetero-
structures and for further property measurements. In order to
achieve this goal, we treated the ZnO seed layer first before
we fabricated the ZNA. The microstructure of the ZnO seed
layer is known to affect the alignment and density of ZNA
greatly [26].
Figure 2 shows the θ–2θ XRD scan of bare ZNA and
BFO/ZNA hetero-structure with 2θ ranging from 20◦ to 60◦,
demonstrating that the bare ZNAs possess a preferential c-axis
orientation. The ZnO(0002) peak was located at 34.54◦. The
c-axis orientation of individual ZNAs was also confirmed by
HRTEM and selected area electron diffraction. The HRTEM
observation revealed that the nanorods were single-crystal (not
shown here).
Figure 2 shows diffraction patterns of BFO/ZNA with
BFO deposited by sputtering at ambient temperature and
annealed at various temperatures of 350 ◦C (BFO/ZNA-
A350), 450 ◦C (BFO/ZNA-A450), and 550 ◦C (BFO/ZNA-
A550) for 15 min. The as-deposited sample without annealing
is designated as BFO/ZNA. The perovskite BFO phase
crystallizes at 450 ◦C. The XRD exhibits that the BFO
perovskite possesses one (110) peak only. It is not a preferred
orientation which will be discussed later. The lattice parameter
of the pseudo-cubic unit cell of BFO is determined to be
0.396 nm. Some Bi2O3 secondary phases occur when the
annealing temperature rises to 550 ◦C. It is considered that
higher annealing temperature affects the stoichiometry of the
Bi, Fe, and O ions due to the evaporation of bismuth.
FESEM of the bare ZNA and the BFO/ZNA hetero-
structures annealed at 25, 350, 450, and 550 ◦C are shown in
figures 3(a)–(e). The corresponding cross-sectional images are
also shown in figures 3(f)–(j). All ZNAs were prepared in
hydrothermal solution for 5 h. The diameters of BFO/ZNA
hetero-structures are in the range of 20–50 nm. The thickness
of BFO shell was observed to be 4–5 nm by HRTEM which
will be demonstrated later.
The bare ZNA displays six prismatic planes in figure 3(a)
and shows good c-axis alignment in figure 3(f). Well-
aligned ZNA provides a good positive template for the
BFO deposition by a sputtering process. BFO/ZNA hetero-
structures are shown in figures 3(b)–(e). After BFO deposition,
the smooth tops of nanorods become bowed and the hexagonal
shape turns into a round shape as compared with the bare
ZNA. Moreover, coalescence of ZnO rods starts to occur
at 450 ◦C. The coalescence phenomenon increases with
temperature (as shown in the black circles in figures 3(d)
and (e)). Cross-sections of BFO/ZNA hetero-structures are
shown in figures 3(f)–(j). Apparently, the surfaces of ZnO
nanorods appear to be covered by BFO layers. The as-
deposited BFO/ZNA-A25 and BFO/ZNA-A350 specimens
exhibit excellent coverage of BFO on ZNA as shown in
figures 3(g) and (h), respectively. In contrast, the surfaces of
BFO/ZNA annealed at 450 and 550 ◦C become uneven.
In varying the growth time in the hydrothermal synthesis,
we obtained ZNAs with different lengths in order to investigate

addition, the lattice spacings of (220) and (22¯2) measured
from figure 6(b) are 0.14 and 0.11 nm, which agree with
their theoretical values. Therefore, the electron diffraction
pattern can be indexed as shown in figure 6(c). The zone
axis of BFO is [11¯2¯]. The orientations of [220] and [22¯2]
are shown in figure 6(b). After indexing, the direction in the
BFO shell parallel to the ZnO [0002] is [15¯3] rather than [220].
After inspecting several regions in the BFO shell (figure 6(a)),
each region shows a different orientation. The orientations
in different regions are shown by red lines. This indicates
that the appearance of a single (110) peak in XRD patterns
does not imply that the BFO shells possess a [110] preferred
orientation. The (110) peak is the strongest peak in the powder
pattern of BFO. Similar behavior was also reported on BFO
nanostructures [27].
To obtain the elemental dispersion of the BFO/ZNA-A450
specimen, an EDX line scan on the TEM was carried out.
The intensities of Zn, Bi, Fe, and O scans from point A to
B are shown in figures 7(a) and (b). The diameter of the ZnO
core is shown to be about 40 nm (as indicated by the black
dashed line in figure 7(b)) and the BFO shell about 10 nm.
Apparently, the Zn signal is higher in the core region and
gradually decreases when it approaches the BFO shell sides.
The Bi, Fe, and O signals show uniform distributions across the
BFO/ZNA hetero-structure. This further verifies the existence
of the BFO/ZNA core–shell structure.
XPS, a powerful surface analysis tool, is able to provide
information of each element in the sample and the surface
chemistry. The samples of the bare ZNA and BFO/ZNA-A450
were further detected by high resolution XPS.
Figures 8(a) and (b) are the XPS spectra of Zn 2p and
O 1s core levels, respectively, of the ZNA. Figure 8(a) displays
a doublet at 1021.4 and 1044.5 eV corresponding to the
Zn 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core levels [28].The asymmetric peak
observed in the O 1s region (figure 8(b)) can be separated
into two components, which are attributed to (i) O in ZnO
(530.2 eV) and (ii) O in ZnOx or Zn–OH (531.6 eV). The
higher energy region indicates the presence of some Zn(OH)2
phase in the sample [29, 30]. The Zn–OH can be easily formed
by absorbing atmospheric moisture. Notably, the Zn 2p signal
cannot be observed in BFO/ZNA-A450 due to the full covering
of the BFO shell. Figures 8(c) and (d) show the XPS spectra
of Bi 4f and Fe 2p core levels of the sample BFO/ZNA-A450,
respectively. In figures 8(c) and (d), the two top figures show
the XPS spectra of the as-deposited BFO/ZNA-A450, while the
two bottom figures show XPS spectra after the surface layers
were removed by ion sputtering. The peaks in the as-deposited
BFO/ZNA-A450 are located at binding energies of 164.0 and
158.6 eV, which show that the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 orbitals

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared BFO/ZNA hetero-structures by
a positive template method. High quality and well-aligned
ZNAs (diameter 40 nm) were grown by a hydrothermal method
as positive templates. BFO shells (shell thickness 5 nm)
were deposited by sputtering at ambient temperature and then
annealed in oxygen atmosphere to form BFO/ZNA hetero-
structures. XRD patterns and HRTEM images demonstrated
the polycrystalline nature of the BFO shells. In addition,
the BFO shell was covered well on ZNA as observed by
EDX line scanning and XPS. The M–H loops demonstrated
that the BFO/ZNA hetero-structure possessed a ferromagnetic
order with enhanced coercivity and saturated magnetization as
compared with BFO thin films, which is attributed to the grain
size confinement effect. Further investigations of the physical
and chemical properties on the nm-scale are in progress.

Abstract  
 In this work, we report the integration of ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite shell to the ZnO 
nanorod arrays (ZNA). The results of the X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy showed 
that the crystallization of perovskite BFO was much easier on ZNA than on ZnO thin films. Evidences 
indicated that the ZnO {10 1 0} surfaces were better depositing surfaces for perovskite BFO than its 
(0002) surface. Through the observation of high resolution transmission electron microscopy, the crystal 
growth of perovskite BFO on ZNA was attributed to the existence of a large number of zigzag structures 
on the {10 1 0} surfaces of the ZNA. The large lattice mismatch between perovskite BFO and wurtzite 
ZnO and easy reduction of Bi caused poor adhesion to ZNA, which hindered the formation of BFO 
perovskite shell. Accordingly, to effectively form BFO shells on ZNA, a two- step process, i. e. 
sputtering BFO on ZNA at ambient temperature followed by an 450 oC annealing in oxygen, was

conditions. To understand the crystal growth behavior of perovskite on ZnO materials more completely, 
we prepared BFO on different ZnO substrates.  
In this manuscript, BFO was rf-magnetron sputtered on ZnO thin film and ZnO nanorod substrates to 
fabricate the BFO/ZnO thin film hetero-structures and BFO/ZNA core/shell hetero-structures. 
Surprisingly, we found that growth behaviors of BFO on these two substrates were very different. The 
crystal growth behavior of the BFO perovskite on ZNA was concluded by investigating its 
crystallization behavior on different ZnO substrates. 
 
2.Experimental details 
In order to produce ZNA positive templates suitable for BFO deposition, the ZnO seed layers were 
carefully controlled to obtain well-aligned ZNA and appropriate ZNA density.23 The ZnO seed layers 
were deposited on Si substrates by radio frequency (rf)- magnetron sputtering using a 99.99% ZnO 
target. The sputtering was carried out under a rf power 45 W and a working pressure 10 mTorr at 
ambient temperature. The sputtering gas was pure Ar. After sputtering, the as-deposited films were 
annealed at 600 oC for 60 min under a pure oxygen atmosphere. For the ZNA growing, Zinc nitrate 
hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) were individually added to 
deionized water to form two 0.02 M precursor solutions. These two precursor solutions were then mixed 
together in a glass bottle. The glass bottle with a substrate was then sealed and maintained at 75 oC for 5 
h in order to grow ZNAs. After the growth of ZNAs, the samples were removed from the mixed 
solutions, rinsed with distilled water, and dried at room temperature overnight. 
The BFO shells were deposited on the ZnO thin films or on the ZNAs by rf- magnetron sputtering 
using a 99.99% BFO target at ambient temperature or 350 oC. Rf-magnetron sputtering was carried out 
at a base pressure of 5x10−6 Torr and a deposition pressure of 10 mTorr with an Ar/O2 ratio of 7/3. For 
samples with BFO sputtered at ambient temperature (either BFO/ZnO thin films or BFO/ ZNA hetero-
structures), they were further annealed in pure oxygen at 450 oC for 15 min.

layers are (0002) prefer- oriented and possess good crystal quality. Fig. 1b shows that sputtered BFO at 
350 oC on ZnO films does not result in perovskite phase but other second phase, which is identified as 
Bi2O3. Fig. 1c shows that sputtered BFO at ambient temperature is amorphous without the appearance of 
any crystalline phase. Fig. 1d shows the XRD pattern of the BFO sputtered at ambient temperature 
followed by annealing at 450oC in oxygen atmosphere, indicating that only Bi2O3 was formed, the same 
as Fig. 1b. Increasing the sputtering temperature could not produce perovskite BFO either. Perovskite 
BFO is difficult to form directly on ZnO thin films. The difficulty to form perovskite BFO on wurtzite 
ZnO might be due to their lattice mismatch which hindered the nucleation of perovskite. 
 
Fig. 1e exhibits the XRD of ZNAs grown on ZnO seed layers, showing that ZNA are (0002)-oriented, 
which is the same as ZnO seed layers. The XRD patterns of BFO sputtered on ZNA are shown in Figs. 
1f-h. Fig. 1f shows that BFO shell sputtered at 350 oC produced a weak phase which is identified as 
metallic Bi. The metallic Bi formed on ZNA was different from that formed on ZnO thin films, Bi2O3. 
Only traces of perovskite were formed on ZNA by sputtering at 350 oC as evidenced by the very weak 
32o peak. We also found that raising the sputtering temperatures of BFO to higher than 350 oC could not 
improve the formation of perovskite phase. Fig. 1g shows that the BFO shell sputtered on ZNA at 
ambient temperature is amorphous similar to that sputtered on ZnO thin films. As for the BFO shell 
sputtered at ambient temperature and followed by an annealing at 450 oC in oxygen, Fig. 1h indicates the 
occurrence of perovskite BFO. The two-step procedure of BFO shell fabrication on ZNA results in 
perovskite BFO. The BFO shows only one (110) diffraction peak. 
     It is interesting to note that perovskite BFO can be deposited on ZNA but not on ZnO thin films. 
The crystallization of perovskite depends greatly on the geometry of the substrates. ZnO thin films are 
(0002)-oriented, therefore, BFO only has the ZnO (0002) plane to grow the perovskite phase. In 
contrast, ZNAs possess hexagonal nanorods. Each ZnO nanorod has one top (0002) plane and six 
{10 1 0} planes exposed for crystallization of perovskite. The {10 1 0} planes seem to facilitate the 
crystallization of the perovskite phase. Furthermore, perovskite BFO could not be deposited on ZNA at

stacked on the top (0002) planes of ZnO nanorods. In contrast, only loosely distributed particles appear 
on the ZnO {10 1 0} side planes. The stacked particles on top of ZNA are metallic Bi. Only very weak 
perovskite diffraction was found in figure 1f; the loosely distributed particles formed on the side planes 
of ZNA are probably the perovskite phase. The {10 1 0} side planes of ZnO nanorods are suitable for 
perovskite crystallization; however, they are hard for perovskite BFO to form under the sputtering 
condition. Few perovskite BFO was formed on ZNA which might be due to higher temperature caused 
by plasma bombardment so that Bi3+ ions were reduced to metallic Bi. The BFO sputtering at ambient 
temperature was amorphous which could adhere to ZNA more effectively without causing the reduction 
of Bi3+, as shown in figure 3c.  Figure 3c shows the BFO sputtered at ambient temperature and then 
annealed at 450 oC. Apparently, there is a discernible shell covering on the sides of ZnO nanorods and 
the top surface changes a shape from hexagonal to circular. The 450 oC annealing invokes the 
crystallization of perovskite not only on the side planes of ZnO nanorods but also on the top (0002) 
plane. Figure 3d illustrates that the surfaces of BFO/ZNA hetero-structures are a little rough due to the 
crystallization of perovskite. The rough surface implies that the perovskite is polycrystalline.

 The interface between the ZnO nanorod core and the BFO shell is drawn by a white dash line in 
figure 4e. The lattice spacing of the ZnO nanorod as indicated in figure 4e is 0.52 nm, which is equal to 
the lattice spacing of the ZnO (0001) planes. The [0002] direction (equal to [0001]) of the ZnO nanorod 
is indexed by an arrow. The [0002] direction is the same as that observed by XRD. The lattice spacing 
of the BFO shell is measured to be 0.28 nm, which equals to the BFO (110) spacing. The normal line of 
BFO [110] is indexed by a short and large arrow. By investigating another region of the BFO shell in 
figure 4d, the normal of the planes with a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm can also be indexed as BFO [110] 
as shown in figure 4f. Comparing figure 4e with figure 4f, the [110] directions are not completely

shown in figures 5b-c. The surfaces of both planes are drawn with black dot lines to exhibit their 
difference more clearly. In figure 5b, the ZnO (0002) plane exhibits atomically smooth plane with 
occasional kinks. In contrast, the ZnO {10 1 0} planes show bumpy and zigzag surface morphology. The 
surface roughness may be associated with the surface energy of different crystal planes in ZnO crystal. 
The surface energy of the ZnO (0002) plane is 2.04-2.25 J/m2, while that of the {10 1 0} planes is 1.12 
J/m2. 24 Surfaces with higher surface energies favor to be smooth; while those with lower surface 
energies tend to be rough. It is considered that the high roughness of the ZnO {10 1 0} surfaces invokes 
the crystallization of perovskite phase of BFO on ZNA. The perovskites on the {1010} planes of ZNA 
may finally grow toward the top (0002) surface. 
     Based on the experimental results and the discussion, it is concluded that perovskite BFO is 
difficult to be prepared on ZnO thin films and ZNA due to lattice mismatch. Because of the high 
roughness of the ZnO {10 1 0} surfaces, the interface between the BFO and the ZnO possesses 
disordered regions which may alleviate the mismatch issue and provide easy nucleation sites for 
perovskite. The crystallization of perovskite BFO will be enhanced if a perovskite buffer can be formed 
on ZnO thin films or ZNA. There is no problem for perovskite BFO to grow on perovskite buffer layer. 
      
D.Growing BFO on ZNA with a perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) buffer  
LNO is known to be easily fabricated on various substrate materials. 25 It would be an excellent choice 
for buffer layers. The LNO buffer layer was deposited by the same sputtering parameters like BFO. 
Figure 6a shows the XRD patterns of the LNO buffer sputtered at 350 oC onto ZNA, namely LNO/ZNA. 
The diffraction peak at 2θ = 32.5° is the (110) peak of the LNO, indicating that the LNO buffer 
possesses a perovskite structure on the ZnO nanorod template. Figure 6b is an SEM photograph of the 
LNO/ZNA. There is a uniform shell of LNO on ZNA. The inset in figure 6b is the enlarged image of the 
tip region. The flat ZnO (0002) plane has changed to an oval shape, which demonstrates a covering of 
LNO on ZNA. The XRD pattern of BFO sputtering at 350 oC onto LNO/ZNA is also shown in figure 6a. 
The diffraction pattern shows that perovskite BFO can be fabricated easily by sputtering BFO directly at

crystallization of perovskite BFO shells. In contrast, the (0002) surface of ZNA was atomically flat on 
which the perovskite was difficult to nucleate.

Abstract 
BiFeO3 (BFO) shells were fabricated by radio frequency (RF)-magnetron 
sputtering on ZnO nanorod array (ZNA) templates with LaNiO3 (LNO) buffer layers. 
Well-aligned ZNA grown hydrothermally was chosen as a positive template. A LNO 
buffer layer deposited on ZNA by RF-magnetron sputtering was demonstrated to 
improve the adhesion and crystallization of the sequentially sputtered BFO shells. 
Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy 
dispersive x-ray, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and high resolution transmission 
electron microscopy were employed to characterize the BFO/LNO/ZnO core-shell 
structures. The electric properties were evaluated by conductive atomic force 
microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy. The results demonstrated that the BFO 
shells possessed excellent insulation resistance, high piezoelectricity, and high

1. Introduction 
Rhombohedrally distorted perovskite BiFeO3 (BFO) [1], one of the very few 
multiferroics, has attracted great attention due to simultaneous coexistence of 
ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic properties at room temperature with a Curie 
temperature TC of 1103K and a Neél temperature TN of 643K [2], which makes it a 
promising material for applications of memory devices, magnetoelectric sensors, and 
spintronic devices [3]. 
One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanorods, have gradually attracted 
interest due to the possible improved properties in comparison with the conventional 
bulk structures. Fabrication of multiferroic nanostructures with a controllable size and 
shape is important not only for basic scientific studies but also for new device 
innovations. 
Previous researches of BFO were largely focused on bulk structures or thin films 
with only a few reported on BFO nanostructures [2,4]. Zhang et al. [5] and 
Hojamberdiev et al. [6] synthesized BFO nanostructures in solution by a hydrothermal 
method in an autoclave. The resulted BFO nanostructures were not directly integrated 
on substrates. Template-assisted methods were adopted in several researches to directly 
grow BFO nanorod arrays on substrates. Zhang et al.
 
[7] and Wang et al. [8] used 
5 
 
ZnO (GZO) seed layer was deposited on Si substrates by RF-magnetron sputtering 
using 1 at% Ga-ZnO target. The deposition was carried out under a working pressure of 
10 mtorr and a RF power of 45W at room temperature. The sputtering gas was pure Ar. 
The thickness of GZO thin film was about 150 nm. For the growth of ZNA, a mixture of 
10 mM aqueous solution of Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) and 
hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was used as the precursor source in a glass bottle. The 
glass bottle with substrates was then sealed and maintained at 75 ℃ for 2 h to grow 
ZNA. After the growth of ZNA, the samples were rinsed with distilled water, and dried 
at room temperature overnight. The LNO buffer layer and BFO shell were deposited by 
RF-magnetron sputtering under substrate temperature of 350
o
C, working pressure of 10 
mTorr, and an Ar/O2 ratio of 7/3 using 99.99% LNO and BFO targets, respectively. 
The crystal phases were analyzed by grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) 
(PANalytical X'Pert Pro (MRD)). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL-6500) 
equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) system was utilized to observe the 
surface morphologies and the chemical composition. A high resolution transmission 
electron microscope (HRTEM) (JEM-2010) was used to investigate single nanorod in 
atomic scale. The conduction properties of BFO/LNO/ZNA core-shell nanorods were 
evaluated using conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) (SEIKO SPA-300HV) 
7 
 
ZNA template as well as BFO/ZNA, LNO/ZNA, and BFO/LNO/ZNA heterostructures 
prepared by sputtering BFO and LNO at 350
o
C. It demonstrates that ZNA is 
(002)-prefer oriented and the ZnO(002) peak is located at 34.54°. Based on the 
diffraction patterns of BFO/ZNA, no perovskite BFO is observed. Only an unknown 
broad peak occurred at about 32
o
, which is possibly due to amorphous phase. As for 
LNO/ZNA, a LNO (110) peak is identified, indicating the growth of perovskite LNO on 
ZNA. Perovskite LNO can be grown on ZNA at 350
o
C, but perovskite BFO cannot. The 
diffraction pattern of BFO/LNO/ZNA exhibits evident growth of perovskite BFO shells 
on LNO/ZNA. It is apparent that perovskite BFO shell can be sputtered directly on 
LNO/ZNA heterostructures with the help of LNO buffer layer.  
BFO/LNO/ZnO nanorods were broken and spread on Copper grids for 
investigation by HRTEM. Fig. 3a is a TEM image of a single BFO/LNO/ZnO nanorod, 
illustrating that the length and the diameter are about 280 nm and 80 nm, respectively, 
which are similar to the results of SEM. The dash lines delineate the ZnO nanorod, 
LNO and BFO shell, indicating the BFO shell on the tip is about 20 nm. However, the 
thickness of the sidewall shell is not totally uniform. This is because our sputter gun was 
oblique and samples were rotating when sputtering. Fig. 3b is a magnified HRTEM 
image from the square area shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3c is the diffraction pattern 
9 
 
radius of LNO bottom electrode summarized in Table 1 is 30 nm, which is not too far 
from the tip contact radius. Therefore, we assume the electric field is constant as parallel 
plate conductors. The thickness of BFO on the tip is about 20 nm from Fig. 3a. The 
current at 6V is about 10
-13
 A, so the electric field at 6V in this work is equivalent to 
3,000 kV/cm, and the equivalent detected current density is equal to 3.2×10-2 A/cm2.  
Comparing the leakage currents with the previous reports, the BFO shells 
prepared in this work possess much lower leakage currents. BFO films were prepared 
by various processes. Two main categories are: (1) chemical solution deposition (CSD), 
and (2) physical vapor deposition (PVD) including pulse laser deposition (PLD) and RF 
sputtering. The leakage currents of the BFO films fabricated by CSD are usually lower 
than those fabricated by PVD. The lowest leakage current reported is in an order of 10
-8
 
A/cm
2
 at an electric field 100 kV/cm for CSD process [11,12].  In contrast, what 
reported for PLD [13,14] and RF sputtering [15,16] are much higher, about in an order 
of 10
-3
 A/cm
2
. For BFO films prepared by CSD processes to have a 3.2×10-2 A/cm2 
current density, the applied electric field is about 200 kV/cm, which is much smaller 
than 3,000 kV/cm as reported in this work. It demonstrates that the fabricated BFO 
shells possess excellent insulation resistance. 
Therefore, the conduction mechanisms were fitted only in sections with absolute 
11 
 
the extracted dielectric constants with theoretical ones through the relation of K=n
2
 
(optical refractive index n=2.5 for BFO [14]), the effectiveness of the mechanisms can 
be identified. Fig. 4e exhibits that the dielectric constant (K~6.06) calculated from the ln 
(I/V) vs. V
1/2
 plot is closer to the theoretical value at positive bias, suggesting that the 
Poole-Frenkel emission is the dominant conduction mechanism at positive bias. As a 
rule, the Poole-Frenkel emission is effective only for traps which are neutral when filled 
with an electron and positively charged when the electron is emitted. Traps which are 
charged when filled and neutral when empty will not produce this emission for the lack 
of Columbic attraction [18,19]. Possible defects in BFO consist of bismuth vacancies 
(VBi
3-
), oxygen vacancies (VO
2+
), and ferrous ions (Fe
2+
). Ferrous ions occupying the 
Fe
3+
 sites possess an effective negative charge -1, so it can be expressed as (FeFe
1-
). 
Both VBi
3-
 and FeFe
1-
 become more charged when electron carriers are filled. Only VO
2+
 
become neutral when filled and charged when empty [19]. Therefore, oxygen vacancies 
are considered to be the main defect trap centers for Poole-Frenkel emission. Oxygen 
vacancies are observed to be present in BFO by XPS, which will be shown later. 
On the other hand, Fig. 4f demonstrates that the dielectric constant (K~5.54) 
calculated from the ln I vs. V
1/2
 plot is closer to the theoretical value in the range of 
negative bias, illustrating that the Schottky emission is the dominant conduction 
13 
 
mechanism is the interface-limited Schottky emission at negative bias. 
XPS was used to investigate the chemical bonding and the oxidation state of 
elements. Fig. 5a shows that the Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 doublets locate at binding energies 
of 163.9 and 158.5 eV, which can be indexed as trivalent Bi. Fig. 5b shows that the 
doublets of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 orbitals locate at binding energies of 711.5 and 724.9 
eV. Fig. 5c exhibits that the O 1s core shell locates in 530.2 eV possessing a broaden 
shoulder at about 535 eV. The O 1s core shell can be decomposed into four peaks at 
529.45 eV, 530.41 eV, 531.79 and 534.72 eV. The first three peaks relate to the lattice 
oxygen, the oxygen vacancies, and the absorbed oxygens on the surface, respectively 
[22]. The 534.72 eV peak, which was not reported before, may possibly be attributed to 
absorbed gas containing oxygens. As what we have mentioned above, the leakage 
current have a great relation to the oxygen vacancy, which can be proven by the XPS of 
O 1s.       
PFM was used to characterize the polarization states of the BFO shell and to 
determine the piezoelectric constants. Fig. 6 exhibits the topography and the 
corresponding amplitude and A cosΦ images of in-plane (IP, lateral PFM) and out 
-of-plane (OP, vertical PFM) signals under an alternating current (AC) bias, where A is 
the vibration amplitude and Φ is the phase angle of the piezoresponse (PR= A cosΦ) 
15 
 
in OP signals is attributed to the driven voltage applied in OP direction.  
 Both the contrasts of amplitude (A) and the piezoresponse signals (A cosΦ) are 
enhanced by the increase of the bias. The amplitude is proportional to the piezoelectric 
coefficient. The piezoelectric coefficient can be estimated through the relation:

( ) ( ) ( / )
zz

d pm V

 
 

 
where Δl is the amplitude of the deflection, VAC is the amplitude of the applied voltage, 
A is the amplitude of the deflection voltage, and s is the AFM detector sensitivity. By 
measuring the amplitude of OP signal under varying AC bias and plotting A vs.VAC at 
several positions, the average d33 piezoelectric coefficient can be determined (shown in 
Fig. 7). The slope values obtained at different positions vary in some degree. It is 
possibly due to the fact that the electric field was applied in various directions to the 
polarization at different positions so that the vertical component contributes to the d33 
value is somehow different. The average amplitude is determined to be 11.36 mV. With 
a sensitivity 6.90 mV/nm and an input gain 50 (signal amplification), the d33 is 
evaluated to be 32.93 pm/ V. We also check the d33 of ZnO nanorod as the reference 
with the same measure method, deriving 12.38 pm/V of d33 for ZnO corresponding to 
the previous report. Wang et al. [2] demonstrated that the d33 value decreased with the 
decreasing film thickness with a slope of about 0.125 pm/V nm within the range100-400 
17 
 
bulk-limited Pool-Frenkel emission dominates the conduction of BFO shells at the 
positive bias, while the barrier-limited Schottky emission is responsible for the 
conduction at negative bias due to the interface between Pt/Ir-coated tip and BFO. The 
piezoelectricity and polarization of the BFO shells were characterized using PFM. The 
piezoelectric coefficient (d33) was estimated to be ~ 32.93 pm/ V and the polarization of 
133 μC/cm2were derived, which was higher than that reported previously for BFO 
films.
