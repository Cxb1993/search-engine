If matrix F in (1) is nonsingular, we can express the 
system in “Reciprocal State Space (RSS) framework” as 
given in (4). If the RSS system is controllable [4], using 
state derivative feedback in (5) alone is sufficient to control 
the system. 
BuxANuFxEFx +=−= −−  11    (4) 
xKu −=  (5) 
The basic idea of RSS is briefly introduced as follows. 
A nonsingular matrix A  can have its Jordan form  
through similarity transformation as shown in (6).   
JVVA 1−=   (6) 
where J  is the Jordan matrix whose components are 
eigenvalues of A  while V  is the corresponding eigenbasis. 
In the same way, the similarity transformation of 1−A  is 
described in equation (7). 
VJVJVVA 11111 )( −−−−− ==     (7) 
Based on equations (6) and (7), we can find that the 
eigenvalues of 1−A  are exactly the reciprocals of the 
eigenvalues of A .  For a given generalized state space open-
loop system shown in equation (8), if both matrices E  and 
F  are nonsingular, the state space representation and RSS 
representation of the system are written as (9) and (10), 
respectively. 
FxxE =  (8) 
xAFEx == −1            (9) 
xAxAExFx  === −− 11        (10) 
Therefore, the system eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of 
matrix A in (9) and the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of 
matrix A  in (10) while A and A  have the same eigenbasis. 
Bearing this concept in mind, for RSS in (4), the state 
derivative feedback gain K in (5) should be designed such 
that the eigenvalues of BKA− are the reciprocals of the 
desired closed loop eigenvalues. 
Comprehensive stability, controllability and observability 
criteria of RSS framework has been presented in [4] [7] and 
they are the same as their counterparts in state space 
framework. 
III. TRACKER DESIGN IN RSS FRAMEWORK  
If a system’s state derivatives are directly measured by 
the sensors, the following design approach of optimal 
tracking control in reciprocal state space framework can be 
applied. 
Plant: DruBxAx ++=      (11) 
Measurement of state derivatives: xCy =     (12) 
Performance output: Hxz =     (13) 
Tracking controller: Kyu −=     (14)  
where x , y , u and r  are state vector, sensor measurement 
vector, control vector and reference step command vector 
with magnitude of 0r , respectively while z is the system 
performance output vector, which must track the given 
reference input r . The feedback gain K and feedforward 
gain D can be designed separately and the design 
procedures are presented in the following section. 
A. State derivative output feedback gain design using LQR 
design in RSS deviation system  
The tracking error is defined as 
Hxrzre −=−= 00      (15) 
We denote the steady-state values by overbars and 
deviations from the steady-state values by tildes. Then the 
state , output, performance output, control and tracking error 
deviations are given by 
xtxxtxtxtx  −=⇒−= )(~)()()(~   (16) 
xCytyty ~)()(~ =−=      (17) 
xHzztztz ~~)()(~ ==−=     (18) 
)(~)()()()(~ txKCyKKyututu −=−−−=−=   (19) 
)(~)()()()(~ 00 tzxHrHxretete −=−−−=−=   (20) 
When the closed loop system is stable )0)(( =∞x , we have 
steady state as 
00)( DrDrxBKCAx =+−=      (21) 
Note that the steady state x  is independent of state 
derivative output feedback gain K  in (21). On the contrast, 
if we apply normal state feedback in standard state space 
system as (22), the steady state x  is dependent of state 
output feedback gain K (23). 
0)()( 0 =+−=∞ DrxBKCAx      (22) 
0
1)( DrBKCAx −−−=       (23) 
Based on (16-20), the dynamics of deviation system are 
obtained as

~~
~~)(~~~    (24) 
And the state derivative output feedback of the deviation 
system is obtained as 
xKCyKu ~~~ −=−=       (25) 
Since the feedforward gain D  in (11) does not appear in 
deviation system (24), we may first design the state derive 
output feedback gain K using LQR approach in RSS 
framework. 
To regulate the error deviation )(~)(~ tzte −= to zero, we 
propose selecting K to minimize the following performance 
index J .

Another type of tracking controller in (47) can work for the 
RSS system in (44-46) and a brief discussion is provided as 
follows. 
Plant: uBxAx +=       (44) 
Measurement of state derivatives: xCy =     (45) 
Performance output: Hxz =     (46) 
Tracking controller: NrKyu +−=    (47) 
When the closed loop system is stable )0)(( =∞x , we have 
steady state as 
00)( BNrBNrxBKCAx =+−=     (48) 
It can be shown that the RSS system in (44-47) has the same 
deviation system as the RSS system in (11-14).  
Therefore, the optimal feedback gain K can be designed 
using the same LQR approach in RSS framework presented 
in the previous. The only difference is that (35) becomes 
TTTT BNrBNrxxX 00==      (49) 
When the steady state of tracking error is zero, we have 
0)()( 0000 =−=−=−=∞ rHBNIHBNrrxHre  (50) 
Consequently, we have feedforward gain N as 
1)( −= rightHBN      (51) 
where 1)( −rightHB is the right inverse of matrix HB .  
Suppose that HB is a nm× full rank matrix and nm ≤ . 
We have the right inverse of matrix HB  as 
11 ))(()()( −− = TTright HBHBHBHB    (52) 
In the other words, for the system in (44-47), if the size of 
performance output vector in (46) is less than or equal to the 
size of control input vector in (47), we can use (51) to solve 
for feedforward gain N . 
IV.  SIMULATION EXAMPLE OF NANO-POSITIONER 
  The nano-positioner model in [6] is used for simulation to 
verify the proposed tracking control algorithm developed in 
RSS framework. The detailed structure of the nano-
positioner is given in Fig.1. Assuming a micro-
accelerometer is attached on the positioner as sensor and an 
origin homing sensor is installed at 0=x so that the nano-
positioner can always start to operate from the origin.  
 
Figure 1  Nano-positioner 
When piezoelectric actuator pushes the platform to 
desired position, flexible steel plates are deformed to 
generate both elasticity and damping. The equivalent mass, 
damping and spring model of nano-positioner is plotted in 
Fig. 2 for design analysis. 
 
Figure 2.  Mass, damping and spring model of nano-positioner 
 
Define x as displacement and u as control voltage input 
to piezoelectric actuator, the system equation is obtained as 
kdukxxbxm =++   
where, m , b , k , d are mass, damping stiffness and the 
slope of displacement output/voltage input, respectively. 
The values are given as follows. 
kgm 35.0= , vnmd /1.3= , mNsb /61.915= and 
mNk /1095276.35= .   
The system is expressed in the following RSS framework to 
carry out the optimal tracking control design.

For LQR state derivative output feedback design, the initial 
gain 0K for iteration is found using the eigenstructure 
assignment method [4] and is given as [ ]0301.00019.00 =K  
Reference input 0r is selected as a step input.  After trials, 
the weighting matrices in (27) are selected as Q=100 and 
R=0.000001 for the good enough performance.                             
After iterations, the optimal output feedback gain is 
obtained as  
K= [ ]0.0000010-0.0001665       
Applying (42) of feedforward gain design of method 1, the 
feedforward gain is obtained as D= [ ]T01 ；                     
The closed loop poles are

The basic idea of RSS is briefly introduced as follows. 
A nonsingular matrix A  can have its Jordan form  
through similarity transformation as shown in (6).   
JVVA 1−=   (6) 
where J  is the Jordan matrix whose components are 
eigenvalues of A  while V  is the corresponding eigenbasis. 
In the same way, the similarity transformation of 1−A  is 
described in equation (7). 
VJVJVVA 11111 )( −−−−− ==     (7) 
Based on equations (6) and (7), we can find that the 
eigenvalues of 1−A  are exactly the reciprocals of the 
eigenvalues of A .  For a given generalized state space open-
loop system shown in equation (8), if both matrices E  and 
F  are nonsingular, the state space representation and RSS 
representation of the system are written as (9) and (10), 
respectively.

(8) 
xAFEx == −1ɺ            (9) 
xAxAExFx ɺɺ === −− 11        (10) 
Therefore, the system eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of 
matrix A in (9) and the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of 
matrix A  in (10) while A and A  have the same eigenbasis. 
Bearing this concept in mind, for RSS in (4), the state 
derivative feedback gain K in (5) should be designed such 
that the eigenvalues of BKA − are the reciprocals of the 
desired closed loop eigenvalues. 
Comprehensive study for stability, controllability and 
observability criteria of RSS framework has been presented 
in [4] and [7]. 
III. VSC DESIGN IN RSS FRAMEWORK  
In this section, VSC design procedure in RSS framework 
is presented.  Consider the following RSS system described 
as: 
( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( ) ( )tdtButxtAAtx ++∆+= ɺ   (11) 
where ( ) ntx ℜ∈ , ( ) mRtu ∈ and ( ) 1×ℜ∈ ntd are states, 
control inputs, and external disturbance respectively.  
Assuming that the pair ( )BA,  is known and the dimensions 
are 
nnA ×ℜ∈ and mnB ×ℜ∈ .The following assumptions 
are used in analysis. 
a.  The nominal RSS system ( 0=∆A ) is unstable. 
b. The pair ( )BA,  is controllable. 
c. The uncertainty ( ) nntA ×ℜ∈∆  is a mismatched 
uncertainty. 
d. The external disturbance is a matched  one and is 
defined as  
( ) ( )tBdtd r=  (12) 
where ( ) 1×ℜ∈ mr td . 
Therefore, using (12), (11) can be rewritten as 
( ) ( )[ ] ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]tdtuBtxtAAtx r++∆+= ɺ  (13) 
We assume that positive scalars, Aδ  and dδ  , are the upper 
bounds of the uncertainty and the external disturbance, 
respectively. 
( ) AtA δ≤∆ , and ( ) dr td δ≤   (14) 
A. Selecting sliding surface with modified transfer 
matrix method in RSS framework 
Now, we may first neglect the uncertainty A∆  and 
disturbance d  in (11) in selecting the sliding surface. A 
popular method introduced in [6] is modified to select the 
sliding surface ( )ts .A controllable RSS system with 
matched disturbance and its sliding surface ( )ts  are given 
as: 
( )aaa duBxAx ++= ɺ  and 0== aCxs
  
   (15)  
where nnA ×ℜ∈ , [ ] mnTBBB ×ℜ∈= 21 , nax ℜ∈ , mu ℜ∈ ,
1×ℜ∈ mad , nmS ×ℜ∈ , 
mmnB ×−ℜ∈ )(1 and mmB ×ℜ∈2 , 
and 2B  is nonsingular. 
At first, we have to find a block transfer matrix T  such 
that 
[ ]TBTB 20= and aTxx =       (16) 
The block transfer matrix T  is selected as:

        (17) 
Let [ ]Txxx 21= , where mnx −ℜ∈1 , mx ℜ∈2 . 
The sliding surface is designed as: 
[ ] [ ] [ ] 022221 ==== xIkSxSkSxSSs m     (18) 
where ( )mnmS −×ℜ∈1 , mmS ×ℜ∈2 and
( )mnmk −×ℜ∈ . 
In (18), 2S  can be considered as any square matrix, and if 
we select mIS =2 , we have sliding surface as follows. 
[ ] 21 xkxxIks m +== .      (19) 
With (16-19), system in (15) is transferred to (20-22).  
2121111 xAxAx ɺɺ +=         (20) 
( )aduBxAxAx +++= 22221212 ɺɺ
    
 (21) 
021 =+= xkxs        (22) 
Solving for 2x with (22), we have: 
The condition (40) implies that (36) leads 0<Vɺ  for 0≥t .  
Therefore, the mismatched uncertainty eA  in (31) which 
operates in the sliding mode is asymptotically stable.

T  and [ ]211 RRT =− , the uncertain matrix 
11A∆  and 12A∆  in (27) can be expressed as 
1111 ARLA ∆=∆  and 2112 ARLA ∆=∆  respectively.  So 
the uncertainty eA∆  given in (31) can be rewritten as: 
kARLARLAe 2111 ∆−∆=∆                                         
kARLARLAe 2111 ∆+∆≤∆⇒

( )mni −= ,,2,1 … , Therefore, (42) is proven.  
Above is a similar approach to that in [8]. 
C. Design the VSC Controller 
  When the system operates in the sliding mode, it meets 
the approaching condition. Using (11), the sliding surface is 
as 
( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )[ ] 0=++∆+== tdtuBtxtAACCxts rɺ (45) 
And if we choose ( )tu = ( )tueq  in (45), the equivalent 
control is found as 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( )tCBdtxACtxCACBtu req +∆+−= − ɺɺ1
   
(46) 
Physically, the equivalent control ( )tueq  cannot obtain the 
sliding motion if the initial state is not in the sliding surface.  
The VSC control law for the dynamic system in (11) must 
satisfy the approaching condition of sliding mode. Based on 
(46), the VSC control law is selected as 
( ) ( ) ( )( )txCACBtu ɺ1: −−=
( ) ( )( ) ( )( )εαγδ ,1 tssattxCB ɺɺ ⋅++− −
     (47) 
where δ , γ , and α  are positive scalars such that 
( )tACC A ∆>⋅= δδ
,
( )tCBdBC rd >⋅⋅= δγ , and 0>α , respectively.  
Moreover, ε  is a small positive value, and sat  is a novel 
switching function of the derivative of sliding surface sɺ  
and is described as 
( )

Remark2: The control law (47) can not completely 
eliminate the external disturbance, but it can reduce the 
influence of the external disturbance so that the states are 
bounded.
