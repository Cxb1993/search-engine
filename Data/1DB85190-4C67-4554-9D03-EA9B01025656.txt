低頻率脈衝電磁波Low-frequency Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (EMF)已被證明可縮短
骨折復原時間及改善治療效果．在臨床上已被廣泛應用在非癒合及遲緩性瘉合骨折的修
復。但截至目前為止，電磁波無法修復大於一公分的骨折．為了不過多消耗體內健康組織，
組織工程為修復較大之創傷之最佳選擇．
本計畫目的在測試電磁波對生醫材料上之成骨細胞表現型之影響．吾人將成骨細胞
(7F2) 培養於幾丁聚醣多孔性支架及薄膜上．以電磁波（方波18-30高斯, 75赫茲, 脈衝寬1.3
ms, 刺激電場強度3.5mv）連續照射24小時．對照組置放於另一個無電磁波之培養箱內．兩
組細胞在培養至4, 10, 14天後作了細胞活性測試，增生測試，鈣質釋放，鹼性磷酸脢活性，
及細胞螢光染色． 幾丁聚醣薄膜在經過72小時電磁波照射後進行了親水性測試．
試驗結果顯示，經72小時電磁波照射後，幾丁聚糖薄膜之親水性增加。14天後，經過
24小時電磁波照射的細胞內比未經電磁波照射的細胞有較高的鈣質含量。電磁波對於細胞
活性，細胞增生，及鹼性磷酸脢活性有些許改變（稍微增加）但效果不顯著。至於有無電
磁波照射，細胞外觀均為正常之纖維母細胞型態。本實驗得到的結論為電磁波對本實驗材
料親水性有所改變．但在14天內，對於細胞表現之顯著影響僅限細胞內鈣質含量。

Abstract
Low-frequency Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (EMF) has been shown to shorten bone
healing time and showed improved quality effect. It has long been used in clinical applications to
treat non-union and delayed-union bone fractures. However, bone defects over the size of 1 cm
usualy can’t be repaired without external assistance. Tissue engineering is designed to help 
repairing larger size defects without sacrificing much of the host tissue.
We propose to test the effect of EMF on osteoblast cells growing on tissue engineering
material. We cultivated bone cells (7F2 osteoblast) on chitosan scaffolds and films and subjected
the cells to electromagnetic field (square wave 18-30 Gauss, 75Hz, impulse width 1.3 ms,
induced electrical amplitude 3.5mv) for 24 hours. We tested hydrophobicity (contact angle) of
chitosan film after 72 hours under EMF. For cells, their viability, proliferation, calcium content,
alkaline phosphatase activity, morphology, were tested and observed.
Chitosan films exposed to EMF for 72 hours displayed a better hydrophilicity (smaller
contact angle.) After 14 days, cells underwent 24hr EMF treatment released significantly more
calcium than those that did not. There is no significant difference between the two test groups in
cell viability, proliferation, and ALP activity over time, although there was slight increase in cell
viability and proliferation in the EMF group compared to the control. Cells presented normal
fibroblastic morphology in both test groups. Our results suggested EMF has effect on chitosan’s
hydrophilicity but other than cellular calcium content, has limited effect on osteoblast cells
cultured on porous chitosan scaffolds in 14 days.

3Total DNA
Scaffolds were digested in 1% papain solution at 55oC for 1 hour. The DNA content in the
digest was measured using PicoGreen dsDNA Reagents (Invitrogen, CA, USA). A fluorescent
meter (PerkinElmer, MA) was used to read the emission at 520 nm.
Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)
Scaffolds were cut into small pieces and mixed with 200μl 0.1% Triton x-100 in 0.1M Tris
Buffer, PH=7.2 and sonicated for 5 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000rpm for 5min to
remove scaffold debris. Fiftyμlof cell lysate was transferred to a 96 well ELISA plate and
incubate with200μlsubstrate buffer (5mM p-nitrophenylphosphate in 0.05M
2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol with 2mM MgCl2) at 30oC for 60min. Reaction was stopped by
adding 100uL 1N NaOH and absorbance read at 405 nm.
Calcium content
The same cell lysate from ALP test was used to test calcium content in cells. Concentration of
calcium released from cells was measured using Calcium Liquicolor (Human GmbH, Germany)
and absorbance was read at 570nm.
Fluorescent Stain
Cells used for morphological observation were cultured on chitosan films. They were rinsed
with PBS several times and fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 20 min. Use PBS to rinse off
formaldehyde and permeate cells in 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS for 30 min. Incubate cells in
Rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in PBS for 15 min. Cells
were observed under a fluorescent scope (Olympus, Japan).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA student t-test. Significance is declared if p<0.05.
RESULTS
Contact angle of chitosan films
The result of contact angle test of regular chitosan films (control) and 72-hr EMF-exposed
chitosan films (EMF) is shown in Figure 2. EMF-exposed films showed a lower contact angle
than the regular films (p<0.01). The result indicated films became more hydrophilic after being
exposed to EMF for 72 hours.
Viability test
Figure 1. The EMF setup. The scaffold/cell constructs
were cultured in a 24-well tissue culture plate and placed
in between the two coils of the EMF device (Igea, Italy.)
5The result of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is shown in Figure 5. After 14 days culture, the
alkaline phophatase activities in the cells exposed to EMF was not significantly different from
those not exposed to EMF.
Calcium content
The result of cellular calcium content is shown in Figure 6. After 14 days culture, the calcium
content of cells exposed to EMF was significantly higher than that of cells not exposed to EMF
(p<0.01).

Abstract
Low-frequency Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (EMF)
has been shown to accelerate bone healing time and
showed improved quality effect. It has long been used
in clinical applications to treat non-union and
delayed-union bone fractures. However, bone defects
over the size of 1 cm usualy can’tbe repaired without
external assistance. Tissue engineering is designed to
help repairing larger size defects without sacrificing
much of the host tissue. We propose to test the effect of
EMF on osteoblast cells growing on tissue engineering
material. We cultivated bone cells (MG-63 osteoblast)
on chitosan films and subjected the cells to
electromagnetic field (square wave 18-30 Gauss, 75Hz,
impulse width 1.3 ms, induced electrical amplitude
3.5mv) for 6 hours a day for 2 weeks. We tested the
cels’ viability (MTT assay), proliferation (BCA total 
protein assay), calcium release (Alizarin red and Ca
liquicolor), ALP activity, and morphology (fluorescent
stain). We observed increased cell viability,
proliferation, and calcium release over time. However,
we didn’t see significant difference between the EMF
group and the control group at the end of the
experiment. As for ALP release, the EMF group was
slightly higher than the controlled group, however, it
decreased in both groups after 14 days. Cell showed
normal obsteoblastic morphology throughout the
experiment.
Introduction
Bone fracture frequently happens among athletes and
seniors. Because bone cells osteoblasts are slow
growing cells, it usually takes long for patients to
recover after bone surgery. Bone tissue engineering
combines cells on osteoinductive scaffolds. It helps to
accelerate bone growth and provides a more
economical option for patients other than using
allogenous and heterogenous bone graft and avoided
issues of tissue rejection. Electromagnetic Field (EMF)
has been applied clinically in healing bone fractures
(1-3)。Many clinical and in vitro research showed EMF
not only heals bone fractures but also delays union and
nonunion (4-6). Effects of EMF on bone cells has thus
been studied (7-9). However, the healing effect of EMF
bone fractures larger than 1 cm was not satisfactory
(10,11). We propose that with the help of bone tissue
engineering, the healing of EMF on large bone
fractures (>1cm) can be improved greatly. The effect of
EMF on tissue engineered construct has seldom been
done to the authors’best knowledge. In this study, we
used chitosan as the scaffolding material because it has
been widely used in tissue engineering (12-14) and
found osteogenic (14-16). We propose to study the
influence of EMF on bone cells cultured on chitosan.

In Figure 4, we can see Alizarin Red S stain (calcium
stain) of osteoblasts from both group on Day 14. There
was not much different in color change between the
two groups. Figure 4 shows cells on Day 14 stained for
calcium using Alizarin red S. There wasn’t much 
difference in color between the two groups. Figure 5 is
the fluorescent stain of cells in both groups on Day 14.
Cells seemed to proliferate more in EMF group.

Cells were in typical osteoblastic morphology.
Discussion
The EMF didn’t seem to promote osteoblast cel 
proliferation and viability compared to the control
group. However, it did increase ALP activity after 10
days. The drop of ALP from Day 10 to Day 14 could
be due to the high proliferation rate on Day 14 since
ALP concentration was normalized to total protein. It
would be interesting to see whether the ALP will come
back if the culture was allowed to grow for a longer
period. Cells might divert energy to proliferation
instead of making ALP on Day 14. The result from
Alizarin Red calcium stain (Figure 4) did not show
difference in Ca deposits between the two groups.
Conclusion
This result seemed to show EMF had marginally effect
in promoting bone cell growth and making
extracellular matrix. However, the experiment time is
relatively short compared to the time span used in
clinical treatment. Also, more parameters needed to be
tested before any conclusion.
