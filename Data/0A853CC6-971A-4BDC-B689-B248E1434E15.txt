isotropic in the in-plane direction and that a “cell” with certain metal density can be isolated as a RVE in the in-plane 
direction. This is similar to most micromechanical models developed for composites, for which periodic 
arrangements are typically assumed for the fiber (or inclusion) and matrix. However, the same argument for 
periodicity may not be made for the interconnect stack along the thickness direction, since in interconnect design the 
thin film low-k dielectrics used in the bottom of the stack has drastically different material properties from the 
dielectrics on top of the stack. Consequently, to take into account both geometrical and materials nature of the 
structure, a full interconnect stack with periodic boundary assumption in the in-plane direction is considered as the 
RVE for equivalent material property characterization. Figure 1 shows the schematic of a typical RVE for Cu/low-k 
interconnect, in which the Cu conductors are simplified as staggered dummy pattern from one layer to the next. Note 
that the RVE described in Fig. 1 corresponds to an equivalent medium with orthotropic constitutive behavior. 
However, due to that the dummy metal pattern is only implemented to simulate metal density, and that the layout of 
metal conductor is somewhat random from the macroscopic point-of-view, the homogenized equivalent medium is 
assumed to be transversely isotropic. 
To describe the macroscopically homogeneous medium having material properties equivalent to that of RVEs, 
macro-stress and macro-strain are expressed as the average of the stress and strain tensor over the whole volume of 
RVE such that the total strain energy stored in the heterogeneous RVE is the same as the strain energy stored in the 
equivalent homogeneous medium. In this study finite element based RVE is developed using ANSYS software for 
obtaining the equivalent material properties. Specifically, the equivalent elastic moduli E1, E3, ν12, ν31, G13 and 
coefficients of thermal expansion α1, α3, (1 and 3 denote the in-plane and out-of-plane direction, respectively) for the 
homogenized transversely-isotropic interconnect stack may be obtained by characterizing the RVE responses to 
applied normal, shear, and thermal loads [4, 5]. 
In the case of RVE subjected to normal traction in the out-of-plane direction (denoted as z-direction in Fig. 1), 
periodic boundary conditions are applied at RVE surfaces in the in-plane direction (denoted as x- or y- direction in 
Fig. 1), i.e.,

For RVE subjected to normal loading in the in-plane direction, the same displacement boundary conditions as in 
(1) and (2) are assigned to RVE surfaces. Note that the IC interconnect stack is typically deposited on top of thick 
silicon substrate and has a relatively stiff passivation layer at top. Under in-plane loading the local variations in the 
out-of-plane displacement at top and bottom of the stack should be insignificant. Therefore, when subjecting the RVE

element model of the problem described in Fig. 2(a), it is assumed that the total length of the sample is 50 mm, 
distance between the two loading points on top is 40 mm, moment arm for bending, L is 9 mm, the total length for 
the T-shaped crack along the thin-film interface is 8 mm, and the bending load, P/B = 2 N/mm. It is also assumed that 
the configuration shown in Fig. 2(a) is symmetric and consequently, only the right half of the sample is modeled. 
Since the crack tip shown in Fig. 2 is located on a bimaterial interface (SiN/OSG), the mode I and II stress 
intensity factors KI and KII are complex. The normalized stress intensity factors IKˆ  and IIKˆ  are defined by

By assigning the SiN thickness as the normalizing length parameter h , i.e., h = 70 nm, the strain energy release rate

The global finite element model that consists of Si substrates, an OSG film, a homogenized thin layer with equivalent 
moduli described in (12) with an interface crack between OSG and homogenized layer is first developed to obtain the 
displacement field for the structure under bending. For the local analysis, the model that consists of all thin-film 
layers shown in Fig. 2(b) is constructed around the crack tip. The local model is subsequently solved with 
displacement boundary conditions interpolated from the global modeling results to determine the fracture mechanics 
parameters for the interface crack. As a comparison, the multiscale modeling approach without the equivalent layer 
for the thin films is also performed. In this case, the global model contains only the Si substrates. 
Results of the finite element analyses for the 4-point bending adhesion test are shown in Fig. 3. The local model 
for the 4-point bending analysis considered a rectangular region of width a centered on the crack tip. The rectangular 
local region extended into the top and bottom Si substrates with a depth of a/2 into each substrate. It may be seen 
from Fig. 3(a) that the strain energy release rate obtained from the multiscale model with RVE approach is within 7% 
difference to the benchmark solution when the size a of the local model is larger than 30 μm. On the other hand, the 
conventional sub-modeling approaches without RVE homogenization for the thin-film layers under-estimates the

3.3 Interface crack in a Cu/low-k flip-chip device 
In Cu/low-k interconnect the via 1 bottom etch-stop thin film to low-k dielectric interface is one of the critical 
interfaces that are susceptible to delamination during processing and reliability testing. The problem of an 
etch-stop/dielectric interface crack in a flip-chip package, as shown in Fig. 6(a), is investigated using the multiscale 
modeling approach. The interconnect considered in the analysis consists of 6 levels of Cu/OSG and 2 levels of 
Cu/FSG. Cu conductor in the interconnect is approximated by a staggered Cu pattern with prescribed metal density in 
each metal level. All materials in the package are assumed elastic, and the material constants are shown in Table 2. 
RVEs for interconnect stacks above and below the cracked interface, as shown in Fig. 7, are first developed to 
determine the equivalent properties. For the global analysis, the plane strain model with homogenized layers above 
and below the interface crack, as shown in Fig. 6(a), is developed to characterize the package deformation under 
uniform temperature change from 125°C to -40°C. Note it is observed that, under uniform cooling, contact between 
crack surfaces occurs near the edge of die. In the analysis this is considered using contact finite elements with 
frictionless assumption on the crack surfaces. Result of the global analysis is subsequently interpolated onto the 
boundary of the local model shown in Fig. 6(b) for determining the fracture mechanics parameters. The size of the 
local model (50 μm x 50 μm) is selected based on the observations from Figs. 3 and 5. 
Figure 8 shows the effect of Cu density on the fracture mechanics parameters for the crack tip towards the center 
of die (the right crack tip in Fig. 6(a)). The constants used in normalizing the strain energy release rate and phase 
angle are given by

where the subscript s denotes Si. It is observed from Fig. 8(a) that the strain energy release rate remains relatively 
unchanged for Cu density less than 40%, but decreases as Cu density increases beyond 40%. From Fig. 8(b) it may 
be seen that the crack driving force at the interconnect interface under temperature cooling is mode II dominant, and 
that the phase angle remains relatively unchanged for various Cu densities. The calculated strain energy release rate 
and phase angle may be combined with experimental data on the critical strain energy release rate or the fatigue 
characteristics of the interface to predict reliability for the flip-chip under thermal cycling. 
4. Cohesive Zone Model 
A fundamental assumption of the classical fracture mechanics approach is that pre-existing flaws or defects exist 
in the medium of interest. Its scope is focused on the growth of cracks. This basic assumption prevents using 
standard fracture mechanics approach for answering questions such as cycles or time to delamination initiation at 
corners or interfaces of IC components. To overcome this difficulty, cohesive law of rupture is adopted to study 
damage accumulation locally around the “process zone” of the interface of interest. An additional advantage of the 
cohesive zone model (CZM) is that the interfacial delamination growth under repetitive loading can be obtained 
explicitly. This would allow predicting the number of cycles to failure for a specific structure without using empirical 
formula based on full-scale reliability testing.

analysis for the 4-point bending sample shown in Fig. 10 under fatigue loading are shown in Fig. 13. In this case, the 
epoxy corner angle considered is 45°. The loading profile for each fatigue cycle includes applying a bending 
load N/mm 0.42/ =BP and then releasing the load. It may be seen from Fig. 13 that the first of the cyclic bending 
loads causes the most interface separation. Debond propagations for the subsequent cycles are not as significant as 
that for the first cycle. In addition, it is observed that the debonding process is occurring at a near constant speed 
from the second to fourth bending cycle. 
5. Conclusion 
The interface crack problem for IC interconnect is investigated by using multiscale finite element analysis. The 
study shows that, in order to accurately determine the fracture mechanics parameters for cracks in the interconnect 
stack, it is critical to consider the equivalent behavior of the interconnect stack in the global analysis when using the 
multiscale modeling approach. 
A sample problem of interface decohesion under cyclic loading is also investigated using cohesive law of 
rupture. It is observed that the debonding process is occurring at a near constant speed after the crack is initiated. 
6. Project Milestone and Accomplishments  
Objective of the project is to develop a multiscale modeling tool specifically for the application of fracture 
mechanics at small length scales for microelectronics reliability. It would server as the framework to assess reliability 
of materials interface at micron and sub-micron length scale. The long range goal is to provide a physics-based, 
quantitative assessment of interface reliability, as opposed to empirical data fitted from exhaustive system-level 
reliability experiments. In addition, evaluation of new materials interfaces for advanced microelectronic applications 
using this approach can be conducted at the beginning stage of new technology development, such that timely 
feedback on reliability prediction can be provided for improving processes and materials. The first year milestones of 
the proposed three-year project and their status are given as follows: 
1) Multiscale finite element model (continuum based global model with cohesive rupture based local model) for 
interfacial fracture at micron and submicron scale. 
Finite element based multiscale modeling approach is developed and discussed in this report. Cohesive zone 
model based interfacial failure propagation under cyclic fatigue loading is also described. 
2) Simulating the interfacial delamination in a flip-chip package using the multiscale model. 
The effect of metal density on the fracture driving force of an edge crack on the interface of low-k OSG 
dielectric and SiC etch stop layers in a flip-chip is given as an example of the multiscale modeling methodology. 
3) Effects of processing induced residual stresses & fracture – material deposition and removal. 
Finite element modeling methodology using both element birth-and-death and initial stress mapping approaches 
are implemented. 
The modeling approach developed in this project can be implemented in most of the commercial finite element 
software and is ready to transfer to Industrial users. Technical seminars on this subject were given to R&D groups in 
ChipMOS Technologies Ltd. (2006) and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc. (2007). In addition, two
