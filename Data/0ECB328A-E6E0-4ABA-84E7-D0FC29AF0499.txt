results will be used to compare with the measurements from the fabricated prototype. A simple test result is also presented 
to validate that the proposed tag antenna is strongly circular polarized. 
II. ANTENNA STRUCTURE AND DESIGN 
The proposed circularly-polarized RFID tag antenna as shown in Fig. 1 is fabricated on an inexpensive FR4 substrate, 
with thickness 1.6 mm and relative permittivity 4.4 (loss tangent 0.02). Printed on the opposite side of the 70 (G)  70 
mm2 square ground plane is a 47 (L)  47 mm2 cross-slot loaded square patch coupled to an L-shaped open-end microstrip 
line, whereby the coupling distance is d = 2 mm. Both horizontal and vertical sections of the microstrip line (with width t) 
are located along the x and y directions, respectively, with dissimilar lengths Lx = 32 mm and Ly = 41.2 mm. Located at the 
open-end of the horizontal section is an RFID tag chip terminated by a shorting pin. As for the cross slot embedded into 
the square patch, it is formed by two narrow slots (with 1 mm width) located centrally along the x- and y- axes with lengths 
Sx = 44 mm and Sy= 44.5 mm, respectively. 
 In this design, to achieve CP radiation, the lengths of both horizontal and vertical sections of the microstrip line are 
varied concurrently, so that equal horizontal and vertical patch surface current density (along x- and y-axis), respectively, 
can be excited to form two orthogonal near-degenerated resonant modes. To allow further control over the phase 
difference between the two degenerated modes, the method of tuning both Sx and Sy of the cross slot is employed. When Sx 
< Sy, the current path in the x direction will be longer than its counterpart in the y direction, forming the lower and higher 
resonant modes, respectively. By carefully selecting appropriate lengths for both Sx and Sy, the phase difference between 
the two degenerated modes will be nearly 90 degrees, and a LHCP (left-hand circular polarization) radiation will be 
achieved. Vice-versa, Sx > Sy will give a RHCP (right-hand circular polarization) radiation. In addition, due to the 
embedded cross slot into the square patch, the increased current path will result in exhibiting a much lower CP operating 
frequency, and in turn achieves compact size for the tag antenna. 
III. IMPEDANCE MATCHING TECHNIQUE AND DESIGN PROCEDURE 
The matching technique between the RFID tag chip and the tag antenna is discussed in this section. The proposed 
antenna is designed to operate in the RFID UHF operating band of 922928 MHz designated for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
other  South-East Asia countries such as Indonesia and Singapore. An Alien IC Higgs (RFID tag chip) with impedance 
13.5 – j110 Ω at 925 MHz is investigated here. To achieve an input impedance of 13.5 + j110 Ω for the tag antenna, vital 
parameters (Lx and Ly, and t) of the open-end microstrip line, and the coupling distance d must be carefully selected. In this 
design, the imaginary impedance of the proposed tag antenna is mainly contributed by the inductive reactance of the 
open-end microstrip line. To induce an inductive reactance of j110 Ω, the length of the open-end microstrip line can be 
estimated as follow [17]:

where λ is the guided wavelength at 925 MHz, and Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the microstrip line that can be 
determined by the width t. It is noteworthy that an infinite set of solutions for the parameters of Lx, Ly, and t can be derived 
from the above equation. Here, a preferred solution (t = 1.5 mm and Lx + Ly = 73.2 mm) is chosen so that desirable CP 
bandwidth can be achieved. As for the real part of the input impedance at 13.5 Ω, it can be obtained by tuning the coupling 
distance d between the open-end microstrip line and square patch. 
In summary, the following design guideline as depicted in Fig. 2 (flowchart diagram) is suggested for choosing the 
optimum value for t, Lx, Ly, d, Sx and Sy, so that desirable CP performance can be achieved.  
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
The design of the proposed tag antenna is initially developed by employing the electromagnetic simulation software 
HFSS. With the aid of this simulator, in-depth studies of the tag antenna behavior and its performances can be performed 
thoroughly. As for the input impedance measurement of the fabricated prototype tag antenna, it is performed by using the 
method of the single-ended probe measurement that requires the use of an Agilent N5230A network analyzer, an 85131F 
flexible test cable, and a N1020A TDR probe. 
Fig. 3 shows the measured and simulated input impedance of the proposed tag antenna with optimum parameters; Lx = 
32 mm, Ly = 41.2 mm, Sx = 44 mm, Sy = 44.5 mm, d = 2 mm, and t = 1.5 mm. A numerically calculated input reactance of 
the open-end microstrip-line configuration only (without the square patch) is also included in Fig. 3(b) for comparison. In 
this figure, both simulated and measured input reactance values at 925 MHz for the proposed tag antenna are initially 
observed to be around j110 Ω, while similar result is also obtained for the case of the calculated open-end microstrip line 
configuration only. This verifies that the parameters (Lx, Ly, and t) of the open-end microstrip line are responsible for 
achieving the desired input reactance of the tag antenna. Furthermore, as observed in Fig. 3(a), the measured input 
resistance at 922928 MHz is around 7 Ω above the chip resistance (13.5 Ω), which is designed for a better impedance 
bandwidth. The achieved impedance bandwidth of the proposed tag antenna, determined from10-dB return loss, reaches 
50 MHz (from 904 to 954 MHz) as depicted in Fig. 4. Although the measurement in general agrees with the simulation as 
observed in Figs. 3 and 4, their slight differences may be due to the handling of the TDR probe to perform the calibration 
procedure and the measurement of the tag antenna’s input impedance.

E. Performances of simulated radiation characteristics  
Depending on the RFID applications, there is a possibility that the proposed tag antenna might have to attach to a 
metallic surface. Thus, there is a need to ensure that it is free from performance degradation when mounted on electrically 
metallic objects such as laptop computer etc. Since the input impedance of the proposed tag antenna is unable to match to 
a 50-Ω coaxial line, therefore, it is difficult to measure either the CP (axial ratio) performance or far-field radiation 
patterns by making use of a conventional anechoic chamber.  
Fig. 14 presents the simulated radiation patterns at 925 MHz for the proposed antenna placed in free space and on a 400 × 
400 mm2 metal plate. Note that all the radiation patterns are normalized with reference to the maximum radiated field, and 
the difference between Eθ and E in the direction of θ = 0° is within 1 dB. From this figure, besides verifying that the 
proposed tag antenna can provide a good CP radiation, a reduced back radiation is also observed when the tag antenna is 
mounted on a metal plate 
The simulated antenna gain in the boresight direction ( = 0°,  = 0°) for the proposed antenna placed in free space is 
presented in Fig. 15.  Here, Gθ(0°, 0°) and G(0°, 0°) are the gains of the electric field components Eθ and E in the 
boresight direction, respectively, while Gtotal(0°, 0°) is the combined gain of the two field components. It is initially 
observed that both Gθ(0°, 0°) and G(0°, 0°) have the same gain value at around 925 MHz. However, when the operating 
frequency is lower than 925 MHz, Gθ(0°, 0°) is larger than G(0°, 0°), and in contrast, Gθ(0°, 0°) is smaller than G(0°, 0°) 
when the operating frequency is higher than 925 MHz. These results have further verified that the patch surface currents 
in the x- ( = 0°) and y-direction ( = 90°) are responsible for the excitation of the lower and upper resonant modes, 
respectively. Furthermore, a total gain of about -14.4 dBic at 925 MHz is also observed. The relatively low gain is 
probably due to compact size and low profile of the antennae (substrate thickness of 1.6 mm or 0.00490). 
Fig. 16 shows the simulated antenna gains for the proposed antenna mounted on metal plates with different sizes. In this 
figure, it is obvious that a smaller ground plane size (100 × 100 mm2) will result in achieving a lower gain as compared to 
the other counterparts. Notably, once the ground plane size is further increased above 200 × 200 mm2, similar gain 
performances are observed. Furthermore, when the tag antenna is mounted on a 400 × 400 mm2 or 1000 × 1000 mm2 
metal plate, an improvement in total gain by 6 dB is obtained as compared to that of the antenna placed in free space. This 
enhancement in gain might be due to the superposition of back radiation and radiation from the metal plane. 
 
F. Reading range measurement for CP performance 
The RFID tag is completed by attaching an Alien Higgs chip with threshold power (Pth) of about 14 dBm to the feed 
location of the proposed tag antenna. A FS-GM201 RFID reader module (from Favite) [18] with operating frequency 
902928 MHz and 30 dBm output power, and a FS-GA203 RFID reader antenna with LP antenna gain of 10 dBi are used 
to measure the reading range. To verify that the proposed tag antenna is indeed circularly polarized, the reading range 
measurement is performed by rotating the tag along the   direction, as depicted in Fig. 17(a). For comparison, a 
commercial LP tag (Favite FT-G1205) as depicted in Fig. 17(b) is also involved in the measuring experiment. 
Fig. 18 shows the measured results of the reading range at 925 MHz for the tags placed in free space and on different 
metal plates. When the polarization of the LP tag is placed in parallel to that of the LP reader antenna (i.e. at  = 0°), the 
measured reading range in free space is about 2.8 m. However, when the two antenna’s polarizations are orthogonal with 
each other (i.e. at  = 90°), the reading range is drastically reduced to 20 cm. As for the proposed CP tag, the reading range 
is maintained between 1.38 to 1.44 m at all  angles. Most importantly, when the proposed CP tag is mounted on the 400 
× 400 mm2 metal plate, the measured reading range is doubled to around 2.82 m, which concurred with the results given in 
Fig. 16, whereby an increase in antenna gain by 6 dB is observed for the case on the 400 × 400 mm2 metal plate as 
compared to the case in free space. From the above results, which is summarized in Table II, it has demonstrated that the 
proposed tag antenna is strongly circular polarized, and the reading range can be significantly increased when the 
proposed tag is mounted on a metallic surface. 
 
Table II: Measured reading ranges of the LP tag and proposed CP tag for rotating the tags at  = 03600 by using LP 
reader antenna with gain Gt = 10 dBi.

Instead of using the LP reader antenna (with a higher gain of 10 dBi), a commercial CP reader antenna (Motorola 
AN400) with a lower gain of 9 dBic is used to measure the reading range of the proposed CP tag. In this case, although the 
gain of the CP reader antenna is smaller than that of the LP reader antenna, the reading ranges of the proposed CP tag are 
increased from 1.44 to 2 m in free space, and 2.82 to 4 m on a 400 × 400 mm2 metal plate due to polarization matching. 
 Lastly, for the purpose of comparison, theoretical prediction for the reading range by considering the Friis formula can 
be denoted as follow [10]:
