Abstract  — This study introduces an adaptive 
Tanaka-Sugeno fuzzy CMAC (TS-FCMAC) for 
output tracking control of nonlinear systems. This 
structure has two advantages in two aspects. First, 
to deal with highly nonlinear and time varying 
plant, we modified traditional CMAC into a simple 
structure. This will significantly increase the 
learning speed and performance. Second, if the 
controlled plants are well known, TS_FCMAC is 
constructed as similar as the TS fuzzy system such 
that parallel distribution compensator (PDC) can be 
directly applied for the output tracking with slight 
modified first case. Two examples, Lorenz’s 
equation and linear piezoelectric ceramic motors, 
are given to illustrate output tracking 
performances. 
 
Keywords：Fuzzy, CMAC, Output-Tracking.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller 
(CMAC) was developed by Albus [1]. The 
structure is based on the operation of the human 
cerebellum with good characteristics of 
generalization and fast learning [2-3]. Owing to the 
attractive properties, the CMAC can be used to 
approximate a wide variety of nonlinear function 
and was widely applied in real time robotic control 
issue [4-5, 10-13].  
 Control systems design can be classified two 
catalogues. The first one is the approaches based 
on mathematical model of controlled system. The 
other one is intelligent control based on human 
heuristic and learning algorithm to accomplish task 
[5]. Tagaki-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy is one branch of the 
intelligent control. That is deal with mathematical 
model for system identification and control [7]. 
The fuzzy model identification that determines 
structures and parameters of fuzzy models from 
input-output data is available for this case that we 
cannot have physical (or mathematical) model for a 
nonlinear system. If we have a physical model, the 
fuzzy model construction is employed to exactly 
represent the nonlinear dynamics [8]. This is 
available for mechanical systems by Lagrange or 
Newton-Euler method. 
The identification for NN/ FNN [5] and 
FCMAC [7] are rare used the prior knowledge 
even that the mathematical model is exact known. 
Specially, in CMAC or FCMAC, they seem hardly 
to determine the receptive function or adjustable 
weight even they have good characteristics of 
generalization and fast learning properties.  
In this paper, we propose a new structure that 
may use prior of mathematical model for output 
tracking. First we modified GBF-CMAC [3] 
scheme that is replace adjustable weight with linear 
function of available variables, then the 
corresponding hypercube with a local linear 
function. Since the local linear function is similar 
with TS fuzzy consequence parts such that we 
called this structure of CMAC as TS Fuzzy 
FCMAC (TS-FCMAC). Therefore, a new scheme 
for constructing TS-FCMAC is using prior 
knowledge such that significant reduced learning 
process. The main advantages are 1) if the 
mathematical model is exact known, we can set 
adjustable weight of TS-FCMAC without learning

according to the following equation:

where k  denotes the number of iteration. 
Moreover, the means and variances of the Gaussian 
receptive-field basis function also can be adjusted 
in the following equation to increase the learning 
capability:

where mη  and ση  are the learning-rate parameters 
for the variances and means. The mean and

functions are updated as follows:  
)()1()1( kmkmkm ijijij Δ++=+         (7) 
)()1()1( kkk ijijij σσσ Δ++=+       (8) 
The exact calculation of the Jacobian of the system, 
uyd ∂∂ / , can not be determined due the unknown 
dynamics of the LPCM drive system. Though the 
intelligent identifier [13] can be implemented to 
calculate the Jacobian of the system, heavy 
computation effort is required. To overcome this 
problem and to increase the on-line learning rate of 
the weights, an adaptation propagation law is 
adopted as follows: 
mcm ee +≅δ             (9) 
where mce  represents the change error between the 
reference model and the plant. 
The learning algorithms shown in (4), (6) and 
(7) call for a proper choice of the learning-rate vη , 
mη  and ση . For given small values of learning-rate 
parameters, the convergence can be guaranteed but 
the speed is very slow. On the other hand, if the 
selection of learning-rate parameters is too big, the 
algorithm becomes unstable. In order to train the 
TS_FCMAC effectively, three optimal 
learning-rate parameters, which guarantee the 
convergence of the output tracking error based on 
the analyses of a discrete-type Lyapunov function, 
are derived in this subsection. The convergence 
analyses in this study are to derive specific 
learning-rate parameters for specific types of 
network parameters to assure convergence of the 
output tracking error. 
 
Theorem 1: Let vη  be the learning-rate parameter 
for the TS_FCMAC weights, and let maxcvP  be 
defined as )(maxmax kPP cvkcv = , where v
uPcv ∂
∂
=  and 
⋅  is the Euclidean norm in nR . Then the 
convergence of the output tracking error is 
guaranteed if vη  is chosen as 
22/ uhv yzNλη =  
where λ  is a small positive constant, hN  is the 
number of receptive-fields in the TS_FCMAC.  
Proof： Since

Then, a discrete-type Lyapunov function is selected

experiments of linear piezoelectric ceramic motors 
(LPCM) control system. The command is a 
sinusoidal reference trajectory. The control 
objective is to control the table to move 3± cm 
with damping period 3 rad/sec for sinusoidal 
command. The experimental results of the 
TS_FCMAC control system with optimal 
learning-rate parameters, the measured responses 
of the table position due to sinusoidal commands at 
the nominal and parameter variation cases are 
given in Fig. 6, respectively. The tracking response, 
tracking error and control effort due to sinusoidal 
command are depicted in Fig. 6(a), (b) and (c) for 
at the nominal; depicted in Fig. 6(c), (e) and (e) for 
parameter variation case with 3.7 kg weight, 
respectively.  
 
V. Conclusions 
 
An adaptive Tanaka-Sugeno fuzzy CMAC has 
been proposed for output tracking control. When 
considering highly nonlinear and time varying 
plant, the TS_FCMAC is taken as a new type of 
neural networks. In this case, the means and 
variances of the receptive-field function and the 
weights of the TS_FCMAC are adjusted on–line 
and variable optimal learning rate parameters are 
derived based on the Lyapunov stability sense. If 
the controlled plant is known well, TS_FCMAC 
controller design can be further reduced the 
adjusted weights. This will significant increase the 
learning speed and maintained the performance. 
Examples results have shown the expected output 
tracking performances for the linear piezoelectric 
ceramic motors and Lorenz’s equation..
