二、 研究目的 
    EPCglobal網路[1]為結合 EPC碼、RFID（Radio Frequency Identification 無線射頻識別技
術）與資訊網路等技術，建立一個 RFID全球標準架構[2,3]。另一方面，無線感測網路藉由佈
署大量的無線感測節點(Wireless Sensor Node)於監測環境之中，達到組成一個具有低電量消耗
(Low Power Consumption)、低成本(Low Cost)之無線感測網路(Wireless Sensor Network)。雖然
上述兩項技術早已問世多年且廣泛應用於各種情境下，但面對於資訊家電  (Information 
Appliance) 的概念興起[4]，許多具有「易用、方便、資訊化」以及「可連網」的家電用品將
大量出現在家庭及中小企業網路之中。除此之外，多樣化且異質的互連通訊技術也必然的會在
數位家庭中共存，例如： Bluetooth、IEEE 1394、USB、HAVi (Home Audio Video Interoperability)、
IrDA (Infrared Data Association)、IEEE 802.3、IEEE 802.11、Jini、UPnP (Universal Plug and Play)、
Power Line over Ethernet、Sensor Network、RFID Network、Home Plug與 HomePNA等。 
 
    藉由上述情境的描繪，可以預見在未來的數位家庭裡將產生一整合性介面，以管理如此多
樣化的異質網路通訊技術。為了能夠完全實現並達到在數位家庭裡各種不同類型設備能互相通
訊的好處，每種設備必需能夠自動的去發現在同一家庭裡面的其它裝置並且與其做通訊，以利
提供一個能夠跨不同技術的整合性服務。有鑑於此 OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative)技術
也就間接被催生，許多異質網路結合的複合系統也大多都使用 OSGi技術建構 OSGi Gateway，
透過 OSGi Framework的執行以加速對於數位家庭內異質通訊網路技術之整合，以達到對家庭
異質網路技術的有效控管，而一個智慧型的管理協調者也必需擔任此項工作。 
 
    無線感測網路的感測器多為微小及便宜的裝置，可大量放置於環境中形成一無線感測器網
路(Wireless Sensor Network)進行監控任務，其放置的密度端看所需的應用為何。由於感測器網
路的節點個數從數百至數十萬皆有可能，使得網路的管理常困難。每個 Sensor為獨立的個體，
形成一個複雜的分散式環境(Distributed Environment)；加上 Sensor的電池可能無法置換，因此
能量控制(energy control)幾乎所有 Sensor設計及網路管理首要考慮的重點；再加上 Sensor為嵌
入式系統的裝置，它們故障的機會相形提高，因而容錯（Fault Tolerant）機制於感測器網路的
設計及管理亦不可或缺。 
 
    EPCglobal 網路為一全球標準架構，為供應鏈自動化、追蹤與追溯管理要求下增進資訊能
見度，提供高效率和資訊準確性的物件資訊交換。同時，也因為此科技的應用，EPCglobal網
路使得交易夥伴間達成加速訂單的處理，快速反映顧客需求，同時也在物品的收取、計算、分
類以及運送過程增進效率。 
 
    目前國內外針對無線感測網路以及 RFID整合性系統的研究尚未成熟，多數的研究大半在
硬體的協定配合或雛型化的設計，相較於真正用於計算的巨觀整體架構則鮮少所見。由於許多
的規格界面由不同廠商所生產的裝置，如何整合與管理不同系統所構成的複雜網路環境，以及
如何提供跨平台異質網路之整合管理技術，將為本研究計畫中必需面對的重要研究課題。

將資料傳回做進一步的分析與參考，因為普遍需要長時間的偵測過程，所以有下列事項必
須注意： 
 電池待機的壽命。 
 因氣候因素所需要的應變措施。 
 主機端維護的考量。 
 資料量的擷取與時程的安排。 
 
2. EPC網路 
 
由於在近幾年快速發展的無線射頻物件辨識(RFID)技術[8]，使低成本、可大量涵蓋
的與可佈署大面積的無線射頻物件辨識器有突破性的進展。RFID 系統主要由讀取器
(Reader)、感應器(Transponder)與中介系統(Middleware System)三者串聯而成的無線射頻物
件辨識架構。由國際組織 EPCglobal Inc.所倡導的 EPC Network為 RFID應用的標準科技，
目前世界各大零售通路如Wal-Mart、Tesco及Metro、P&G、Gillette等皆積極參與電子商
品條碼 EPC（Electronic Product Code）之應用[9]。 
 
    EPC Network 結構(圖 1)主要由三個重要元件所組成，包括 Savant、EPCIS(EPC 
information Service)以及 ONS(Object Name Service)。而每個 EPC Network 可以再經由
Global的 ONS連接[10]。 
 
圖 1.  EPC網路架構 
 
    EPCglobal 的 RFID 技術初階段著重在供應鏈的應用，因此須建構傳遞物件資訊的整
體網路，網路主要構成有五個元素： 
6 
 
但體積小、價格便宜、壽命長且干擾較主動式標籤少。 
 
(3) EPC中介軟體(EPC Middleware) 
 
EPC中介軟體主要功能在於收集前端各台 Reader的資訊，過濾讀取到的 Tag資料
有無重複讀取的情形發生，連接後端 ONS跟前端 Reader相當重要的工具，因為現在
的資料庫還沒有辦法在一秒鐘之內存取同時百萬筆的資料，所以有賴 EPC Middleware
先收集整理由 Reader 讀取的資料，進而減少資料的傳輸量，減輕網路負荷，同時減
輕後端資料庫的負擔，以及減少傳輸時可能會有的錯誤，利用演算法去修正，除了接
收和傳遞訊息之外，如何保持資料的正確性以及安全性，為 EPC Middleware最重要
的課題。 
 
(4) 物件名稱服務(Object Name Service，ONS) 
 
ONS分為 Root ONS跟 Local ONS兩類。Root ONS由 EPCglobal負責維護，提供
全球的 EPC搜尋目錄，當廠商在 Root ONS詢問某項商品時，Root ONS告知製造商
的 LocalONS所在處。而 Local ONS則負責製造商端的商品 EPC碼登錄記錄，並提
供查詢服務，會告知商品資訊放置何處。 
 
    此兩種服務可由 EPC Network中查詢 Tag之 EPC碼在何處，其功能很像一般常
見的 URL跟 DNS的關係，URL透過 DNS反查該地址 IP，回傳給查詢端的電腦，該
電腦在透過該 IP 去找到網頁上的資訊，完成 Web 的傳輸服務，而 ONS 亦為相同運
作原理。首先他先在自己附近的 Local ONS上查詢有沒有該 EPC的資訊，如果沒有
的話再往上一層 ONS查詢，最上層的 Root ONS會紀錄所有 Local ONS的資訊，回
傳給查詢端該筆 EPC詳細資料位址，最後可藉由回傳的位址去取出所要的資訊。 
 
(5) EPC資訊服務(EPC Information Services簡稱 EPCIS) 
 
EPCIS儲存該商品貨物更為詳盡的資訊，例如：生產日期、原料、製造商名稱、
商品分類等等。當消費者透過查詢端查詢該商品資訊，會先搜尋該製造商內的所有
EPCIS，沒辦法找到相符合資料的時候再往上一層的全球資料庫查詢，EPCIS會將資
料以 PML 的格式傳輸，以提高資料的共用性以及快速性。實體標記語言(PML)其主
要的功能在節點與節點之間的溝通，以及資訊在整個 EPC network system 的傳輸，
讓每個元件都可以藉由 PML 轉換成能夠理解的表達方式；因此有了 PML 之後，
EPCIS 才能運作，當使用者需求從系統輸入以後，經過 PML 轉成其他系統能夠理解
的表達方式，待執行之後，再透過 PML 轉碼，回傳資訊給使用者。

四、 研究方法 
    本計畫提出以閘道器結合無線感測網路與 RFID/EPC/OSGi網路架構(圖 3)，藉此達到結合
無線感測網路與EPC Global異質網路，以期建立一個複合式且提供多元服務之資訊網路平台，
以下逐步說明研究方法與進行步驟： 
 
1. 情境模擬 
    為了要表達兩者系統結合能提供的優勢與服務，在此藉由情境說明此整合性系統之功
能性：假想情境為使用此系統做農場或生態之觀察與監測。 
 
 情境一：對於特定觀測之物件(可為動、植物或自然生態環境)給予一個含有唯一 EPC
碼之晶片，並在附近周圍部署負責觀測之無線感測網路節點。對於初始紀錄或其他附
註，例如養殖地點、植物學名或目前氣候等等資料，在初始觀測時可先將資料紀錄於
資料庫。後續觀察中觀察人員可以定時去監控即時環境情況，利用 PDA或含有 RFID
讀取器之儀器擷取出當下之環境情形，透過 EPCIS即時查詢即可得知當下狀況。 
  
 情境二：情境一為針對即時環境回報的情況下，另一種情形是長期對於環境改變的觀
察。系統與硬體部署方式與情境一都相同，觀察人員可以使用讀取器取得此株植物生
長環境下特定時間區間中的環境變化量，藉此分析對於植物生長的最佳環境。

閘道器詳細資料轉換步驟如圖 6所示： 
 
 無線感測網路將紀錄之數據資料存入感測系統之資料庫。 
 經由PHP網頁程式將無線感測網路資料庫中預先設定好的資料欄位資料擷取出，
並寫入到 EPC網路資料庫預先設計之欄位中。 
 當使用者使用讀取器讀取 Tag時，EPC網路查詢 Local ONS中是否存在此筆 EPC
碼的資料，若無則無法查詢，或再到 Root ONS中查詢。 
 若有符合的 EPC碼表示此筆資料存在，則 EPC網路繼續在 Local ONS中比對先
前感測網路資料存入欄位中 EPC碼相同的欄位資料。 
 若比對不成功(具有 EPC碼，且物品資料存在，但無感測網路資料)，可能感測網
路發生錯誤或此筆紀錄(感測網路數據)不存在。 
 若比對成功，(具有 EPC碼，且物品資料存在，有無感測網路資料)，則系統會自
動組合兩者因 EPC碼相同所產生的新資料表。 
 最後再回傳給系統含有 EPC碼資訊與感測網路資訊的組合資訊。

色代表上傳，而黃色則代表同時包含上傳與下載的流量。在單獨 EPC 的網路流量測試中運用
同一組 EPC Tag以每兩秒的間隔讀取的動作，整體網路效能呈現非常平穩的狀態，上傳與下載
之流量十分穩定(下載平均為 0.6kb/sec，上傳平均為 0.9kb)。 
 
    而在感測網路方面，觀測的流量情形如圖 10 所示。目前本實驗室所使用的感測網路節點
為 10 個，而每節點回傳資料的時間點皆不相同，感測網路亦自行更新資料，因此在整體的網
路流量上呈現一個較無規律的狀態(下載平均為 18.9kb/sec，上傳平均為 11kb)。最後在閘道器
系統的網路流量上，同樣使用同一個 EPC Tag以每兩秒的間隔做讀取的動作，其呈現的觀測流
量如圖 11所示，在上傳的流量上呈現較為固定的情形，但下載的情形卻有間格式的爬升(下載
平均為 26kb/sec，上傳平均為 17.5kb)。

  為對照此研究所提之架構，本計畫提出一 Bipartite Graph Model (如圖 12所示)，S代表感
測節點(Sense Node)，負責收集環境中所需之感測資訊；CH表示叢集節點(Cluster Header)，負
責傳輸感測節點 S資料並傳送至WSN/EPC閘道器。

    本研究中所提之系統架構主要目的為達到在感測節點 S、叢集節點 Cluster Node與
WSN/EPC閘道器之間最低之通訊成本，因此定義 Transmission Matching Function如下： 
 
TM = min	∑ 	 	!	"	#,			$%  + min∑ 	 	!	&	$%,'           (7) 
 
  TM 表示 E 與 Q 之子集合，且每一感測節點 S 至少連接至其中一個叢集節點，以最多一
連線 e表示，代表此系統將保值最小連線成本為

                where µ(s, ch) is the set of edges in TM that are incident from s to ch and ψ(ch, 
we) is the set of edges in TM that are incident from ch to we.        (8) 
 
在 TM中每一個邊(s, ch)表示感測節點 s被指定至叢集節點 ch負責傳輸感測網路資訊；每
一個邊(ch, we) 表示叢集節點 ch被指定至WSN/EPC閘道器負責傳輸感測網路資料。圖 13顯

    Transmission Matching (TM) 計算如下(如圖 14所示)： 
 
        TM= S(,, ℎ,) + S(-, ℎ-) + S(., ℎ-) + QC(ℎ,, )) + QC (ℎ-, ),

physical interconnection network. It is necessary to have
a special network structure for EPC tag mechanism in an
open and global traceability items. Because the tag only
stores the EPC code, EPC system also requires some
mechanisms for mapping the EPC code with correspond-
ing information. The Object Name Service (ONS) pro-
vides the rules for mapping EPC code to EPC informa-
tion. It is an automated online system which is similar to
DNS system. The primary purpose of DNS is to locate a
computer on the Internet for a specific location. The ONS
simply uses the same technologies of DNS. The opera-
tions of ONS are showed in Figure 2:
 Reader gets information from the tag as a string with
EPC code specification.
 Reader transmits the EPC code to a local server for
processing.
 A local server sorts and filters out unnecessary infor-
mation of EPC code, then the EPC code will be sent to
a local ONS on the next step.
 Local ONS converses the EPC code into EPC domain
name, EPC code will be sent to the designated ONS
name server in order to obtain the required information.
 ONS framework returns the corresponding IP ad-
dresses to PML servers.
 The local ONS sends back IP address to the local server.
According to the IP address of the local server, the
correct PML server obtains the necessary information
related to EPC code.
Accelerate the integration speed of heterogeneous
communication network technology in digital home is
the main objective of this paper. In this research, we use
the EPC network architecture to reach effective manage-
ment and guarantee the service of quality in heteroge-
neous digital home network. Also, the security architec-
ture for EPC network is proposed in this paper. The re-
mainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
provides a survey of communication technologies and
QoS issues in heterogeneous digital home environments.
The system architecture including EPC Network Gate-
way, Security EPC Network Architecture and QoS in
Heterogeneous Digital Home Network Architecture are
proposed in section 3. Experimental results and discus-
sions are presented in section 4. Finally, section 5 con-
cludes this paper.
2. Digital Home Network Environments
2.1 Heterogeneous Network
In recent years, with the flourishing development
of different communication and network technology,
the relevant devices of the network used in homes and
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) grow every
day. The concept of Information Appliance rises [5],
the electrical household equipments will appear in homes
and small and medium-sized enterprises. Besides, va-

work technology for the heterogeneous communication
in the digital home through EPC network framework.
This section presents related topics of EPC Gateway, Se-
curity EPC Network Architecture and QoS in heteroge-
neous digital home network.
3.1 EPC Network Gateway
During this stage, we construct standard services of
different EPC specifications when implementing the di-
gital home gateway system [16].
3.2 Security EPC Network Architecture
About the security issues, this research uses Linux
FreeRADIUS to construct the EPC network for the Se-
cure Product Authority Server (PAS) network frame-
work, provides EPC user to complete EPC Code authen-
tication, identity authentication, transaction authoriza-
tion function, and etc [17]. In order to strengthen the se-
curity of the wireless network, this research constructs
the PPTPD VPN Sever of Linux to provide the WLAN
encrypt mechanism. User can access EPC network to
query the Tag information from this framework. This
study constructs the PAS to EPC network environment,
establishes Smart Phone which has RFID Reader func-
tion, and designs Mobile the RFID network framework.
Furthermore, this research expands the EPC network to
Mobile RFID/EPC network, establishes mobile RFID
technology toward the Omni-directional of security net-
work framework. Figure 5 shows the network architec-
ture of this study which contains EPC-IS Server, EPC-
PAS Server, EPC User of the EPC network framework
(left side of Figure 5); Mobile EPC-IS, EPC PAS Server
and Mobile RFID User of Mobile RFID network frame-
work (right of Figure 5).
3.3 QoS in Heterogeneous Digital Home Network
Figures 6 and 7 show two modes of QoS: DiffServ
Framework and DiffServ Region-wide Framework.
Relative topics for QoS in heterogeneous digital
home network are listed as follows:
 Internetworking: The existing network must link each
other.
 Heterogeneity: It must consider various networks that
contain broadcast, satellite, wireless network, broad-
cast network and other networks.
 Distributed Management: It allows the distributed
management of the resource distribution.

cessary service, Table 2 shows the start and stop time of
application programs in the simulation environment. We
gradually increase the bandwidth requirement of the vi-
deo conference and web phone.
4.2 Simulation Results and Analysis
Figures 11 and 12 show the case of Non-QoS sup-
ported web phone and video conference. When Non-QoS
supported web phone, video conference and interactive
program of refrigerator join the resource competition si-
multaneously, it causes insufficient resources. The delay
time rises from 0.05 milliseconds to 0.25 milliseconds
(Figures 11 and 12) and throughput drops to 320325
kbps and 470475 kbps (Figures 15 and 16). By contrast,
delay time is maintained at about 0.05 milliseconds with
QoS support (shown in Figures 13 and 14). The through-
put also maintains at 350 kbps and 500 kbps, as shown
in Figures 17 and 18. The experimental results show the
different delay time between Non-QoS Support and QoS
Support. The results can make sure that the proposed
QoS supported method has better performance for heter-
ogeneous digital home network environment.

to these technological applications, EPCglobal network 
makes certain that trading partners can process orders at a 
higher speed, provide a rapid, direct reflection of customer 
demand as well asprovide sending, transmitting, computing, 
classification and delivery process to improve efficiency in 
the competition of the same industry. Figure 2 shows the 
global EPC network architecture combined by a series of 
Local EPC networks.
Figure 2 Global EPC Network Architecture
EPC network technology is an important component 
of the EPC system. The EPC information network system 
is based upon the Internet through the Savant management 
software system [7]. The Object Name Service System 
(ONS) and Physical Markup Language (PML) actualize the 
global physical interconnection network. It is necessary to 
have a special network structure for EPC tag mechanisms. 
Since only the tag stores the EPC code, the EPC system 
requires some additional mechanisms for associating 
mapping the EPC code with corresponding information. 
The Object Name Service (ONS) provides the rules for 
mapping the EPC code to the EPC information. It is an 
automated online system with a similar DNS system. The 
primary purpose of DNS is to locate a computer on the 
Internet for a specific location. The ONS simply uses the 
same technologies as DNS. Figure 3 shows the operations 
of ONS.
 y The reader gets information from the tag as a string with 
an EPC code specification.
 y The reader transmits the EPC code to a local server for 
processing.
 y A local server sorts and filters out unnecessary 
information from the EPC code. Then, the EPC code is 
sent to a local ONS at the next step.
 y Local ONS converges with the EPC code into the EPC 
domain name. The EPC code is sent to the designated 
ONS name server in order to obtain the required 
information.
 y The ONS infrastructure returns the corresponding IP 
addresses to PML servers.
 y The local ONS sends back the IP address to the local 
server.
 y According to the IP address of the local server, the correct 
PML server obtains the necessary information related to 
the EPC code.

The main objective of this paper is how to combine 
the RFID and EPC network into a mobile purchasing 
system with cross layer design approach. The mobile RFID 
network and proposed mobile purchasing system scenarios 
are discussed in the following sections.

infrastructure in 2004 [8]. Nokia released the RFID 
mobile terminal equipments with the Nokia mobile RFID 
Kit which supported a mobile RFID reader. The reader 
was compatible with the EPC Class-1 UHF Generation 
2 (860-960 MHz) standard. As shown in Figure 4, Nokia 
also provided users access to the mobile EPC network 
framework and the Information Server with mobile terminal 
equipment. The process is as follows:
(1) A RFID mobile terminal sends the EPC Information 
Server Query to a Local ONS.

manufacturers code. This allows for a query for in-
stock product.
(4) The new queries are sent to the Local ONS with part of 
the EPC product code required by the EPCIS server.
(5) Finally, the user connects to the EPCIS and receives 
the information about the goods (manufacturing date, 
production area, distribution information, etc). At the 
same time, the commodities are prepared for delivery.
Figure 7 Architecture of Mobile Purchasing System
5   System Implementation and Analysis
This paper proposes a cross layer design [11-15] for 
RFID/EPC Network that applies an intelligent mobile 
purchasing system by combining an RFID smart phone 
at the Physical Layer, transferring the RFID code into 
the EPC Network at the Media Access Control Layer, 
gathering the EPC Domain Information at the Application 
Layer and establishing a secure EPC network framework 
with a Product of Authority Server (PAS) network 
environment at the Application Layer (Figure 8).The user 
can makepurchases through a smartphone with an RFID 
Reader by using the cross-layer approach. The Content Web 
Server and the ODS Server are responsible for recording 
commodity information by EPC Code. The commodity 
will be sent directly to the user’s home through the Object 
Tracing Function of the Secure EPC Network (PAS Server).
The AAA Model provides Authentication, Authorization 
and Accounting functions. This Model functions under 
the wireless network environment [16-18]. This research 
completes the AAA Model by establishing the RADIUS 
Server, constructing the EPC network to the Secure 
PAS network framework, and by providing an EPC 
User to complete the EPC Code authentication, identity 
authentication, and transaction authorization function. In 
addition and as a result of the flaw from WEP mechanism 
itself, the WLAN safety mechanism uses WEP encryption 
and decryption to meet security requirement. This method 
allows easy decryption by intruders. In order to strengthen 
the security of the wireless network, this research uses VPN 
to provide the WLAN encryption mechanism. From this 
framework, the user can access EPC network with the tag 
information (Figure 9).
Figure 9 Secure EPC Network Frameworks
This study proposes the use of a mobile EPC network 
as the foundation of the RFID/EPC network security 
framework. First, the EPC network framework of Product 
Authority Server (PAS) network environment was 
studied. Next, smartphone with RFID reader function was 
established. Then, the mobile RFID network framework 
was constructed. Finally, the EPC network to mobile 
RFID/EPC network was expanded. Figure 10 shows the 
composition of this research. The left half of Figure 10 
contains the EPC-IS Server, EPCPAS Server, and EPC User 
of the EPC network framework. ) The right half of Figure 
10 contains the mobile EPC-IS, EPC PAS Server and 
mobile RFID user of the mobile RFID network framework. 
The smart phone and CF card reader are implemented 
in this paper. The smart phone gets the EPC code from 
the CF card based RFID reader. The EPC code is then 
transported to the EPC network. Figure 11 displays the 
process of the proposed EPC network RFID smart phone 
procurement. Figures 12-14 show the interfaces of the smart 
phone, transactions of the EPC Network and the system

In order to map our proposed system (shown in 
Figure 6) for RFID/EPC Network analysis to the bipartite 
graph model, let EO denote the set of EPC Object. Let 
ERN denote the set of EPC Reader Network that sences 
and transmits EPC information of EPC Object nodes to 
Mobile RFID
EPC  Gateway(ME). Let EAN denote the set of EPC 
Access Network that transmits query information between 
Mobile RFID Network and Internet/EPC network (shown 
in Figure 15).
Figure 15 Layers of Proposed System
Let the bipartite graph G = (EO, ERN, EAN, S, T, Q), 
where EPC Objects (EO), EPC Reader Network(ERN) and 
EPC Access Network (EAN) are three disjoint vertex sets 
defined as follows:
 S = {eo, ern} | where eo ∈ EO and ern ∈ ERN} (1)
 T = {ern, me} | where ern ∈ ERN and me ∈ ME} (2)
 Q = {eo, me} | where eo ∈ EO and me ∈ ME} (3)
The EPC Sense Cost function ESC(s) denotes the 
amount cost of sensing communication between the EPC 
Object node eo and the EPC Reader Network ern. 
EPC Sense Cost function = ESC(s), for each s ∈ S where 
ESC(s) > 0 (4)
The EPC Reader Cost function ERC(t) denotes the 
amount of transmison cost that EPC Reader Network needs.
EPC Reader Cost function = ERC(t), for each t ∈ T where 
ERC(t) > 0 (5)
The EPC Query Cost function EQC(q) denotes the 
amount of query cost that EPC Access Network needs.
EPC Query Cost function = EQC(q), for each q ∈ Q where 
EQC(q) > 0 (6)
An edge s = (eo, ern), eo ∈ EO and ea ∈ ERN denotes 
the EPC Object node eo sends data to EPC Reader node 
ern.
Edge s = (eo, ern) is said to cover vertices eo and ern (7)
A edge t = (ern, me), ern ∈ ERN and me ∈ Mobile RFIDEPC  
Gateway(ME) denotes the EPC Reader node ern can be 
used to transmit query to Mobile RFIDEPC  Gateway(ME).
Edge t = (ern, me) is said to cover vertices ern to me (8)
A query edge q = (eo, me), eo ∈ EO and me ∈ 
Mobile RFID
EPC  Gateway(ME) denotes the EPC Object node eo 
can be used to transmit query to Mobile RFIDEPC  Gateway(ME) 
and Internet/EPC network for inquiring EPC information.
Query q = (eo, me) is said to cover vertices eo to me (9)
In this study, the main purpose of the proposed system 
is to minimize the communication costs between EPC 
Objects, EPC Reader Network, EPC Access Network 
and Mobile RFID/EPC Gateway. Hence, the Total Query 
Matching function(TQM) is provided as following: 
TQM = Minimum ∑s∈γ (eo, ern) ESC(s) + 
Minimum ∑t∈m (ern, me) ERC(t) + (10)
Minimum ∑q∈ρ (eo, me) EQC(q) 
TQM denotes a subset of edges of S, T and Q where 
each EPC Object node is covered by at most one edge in 
TQM and for each node in EPC Reader Network, so that 
the system will have the cost equal to Minimum ∑s∈γ (eo, ern) 
ESC(s) + Minimum ∑t∈m (ern, me) ESC(t), where γ (eo, ern) is 
the set of edges in TQM that are incident from eo to ern 
and m (ern, me) is the set of edges in TQM that are incident 
from ern to me. An edge s(eo, ern) in TQM means the EPC 
Object node o is assigned to the EPC Reader Node ean for 
transmitting the EPC code. An edge t(ern, me) in TQM 
means the EPC Reader Node ern is assigned to support the 
Mobile RFID
EPC  Gateway Node me for transmitting the sensing 
EPC information.

6   Conclusion and Future Work
The cross layer design and implementation of mobile 
purchasing system with an RFID smartphone and EPC 
Network are proposed in this paper. Also, we provide two 
scenarios for purchasing in digital home life applications. 
The user can purchase through a smart phone with an 
RFID Reader. A Content Web Server and an ODS Server 
are responsible for recording the commodity information 
by EPC Code. This research completes the AAA Model 
by establishing the RADIUS server, constructing the 
EPC network of the Secure PAS network framework, as 
well as providing the EPC user to complete EPC Code 
authentication, identity authentication, and transaction 
authorization function. By using the cross-layer approach, 
the commodities are directly sent to the user’s home 
through the Object Tracing Function of a Secure EPC 
Network, or an RFID refrigerator actively informs the user 
of purchase messages. Then, the purchasing information 
is sent to the smart phone to complete the electronic 
transaction. In the future, scenarios of purchasing systems 
crossing the EPC network and mobile RFID network will 
be designed.

Abstract
In this paper we present IPas++, a novel accountable 
and scalable Internet Protocol for future internet. IPas++ 
decomposes the Internet into several accountability realms 
(ARs) with self-certifying identifiers and then separates 
edge ARs (EARs) from core ARs (CARs) along the 
identifier/locator separation line. Based on these, IPas++ 
uses a two level hierarchical address structure and an 
inherently accountable inter-AR routing. IPas++ also 
builds a reliable EAR-to-CAR mapping distribution system 
by extending BGP. We show that IPas++ is able to work 
across heterogeneous ARs and discuss how IPas++ meets 
the requirements of future internet including security and 
scalability. We also analyze the performance, deployment 
and weaknesses of IPas++. ;ploiuh

1   Introduction
It is widely recognized that the Internet is vulnerable 
to numerous attacks, e.g., prefix hijacking, route forgery, 
source address spoofing, and denial of service (DoS) 
flooding, at Internet Protocol layer (IP). Because these 
attacks always cause devastating communication failures, 
there is a great interest in protecting the Internet against 
these threats [1-5]. However, despite many solutions, the 
security of the Internet is still poor. The unprecedented 
difficulties in addressing these attacks leverage network 
community to further look into the Internet’s original design 
principles. Recently making changes to the architecture 
to design an intrinsically secure IP has become more and 
more fashionable, and it is almost a common consensus that 
enhancing accountability (referred as the ability to associate 
an action with the responsible entity) into IP would provide 
a firmer foundation for security [6-7].
Poor scalability, which represents as the super-linear 
growth of the Default Free Zone (DFZ) routing table and 
frequent Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) update messages, 
is another serious challenge faced by the Internet routing 
architecture [10]. Currently many researches are being 
carried out and the identifier/locator separation has become 
the mainstream. Although identifier/locator separation is 
still a raw idea and there are many key problems waiting 
for solving, it provides a basic network model for future IP 
design.
In this paper, we present an accountable and scalable 
internet protocol, IPas++. IPas++ regards the Internet as 
an union of ARs, and uses the hash of an AR’s public key 
as the AR’s self-certifying identifier. Afterward, IPas++ 
builds a novel inter-AR routing on these basics along the 
identifier/locator separation line. The binding between 
AR self-certifying identifiers and the inter-AR routing 
bootstraps accountability, and the EAR/CAR separation 
guarantees scalability. IPas++ also uses a two level 
addressing structure to support interconnection between 
heterogeneous ARs.
Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we design a novel 
internet protocol, IPas++, for future internet; (2) we 
evaluate the inherent features of IPas++ and our analyses 
show that IPas++ not only clears the way to solutions 
against prefix hijacking, route forgery, source address 
spoofing, and DoS flooding, but also has better scalability 
than the Internet and the famous scalable routing scheme, 
Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) [12]; (3) 
we compare the performance of IPas++, IPv4, IPv6, LISP 
and two typical new Internet Protocols, the Accountable 
Internet Protocol (AIP) [6] and the Accountability 
Enhanced Internet Protocol (IPa+) [7]; (4) we compare the 
deployment of IPas++, LISP, AIP and IPa+.
The remainder is organized as follows: Section 2 
outlines some of the serious challenges faced by current 
IP. Section 3 highlights the trust model and network model 
of IPas++. Section 4 gives the IPas++ design in detail. We 
discuss the security of IPas++ in Section 5, and evaluate 
the scalability of IPas++ in Section 6. We also analyze the 
performance of IPas++ in Section 7. Section 8 compares 
the deployment of IPas++, LISP, AIP and IPa+. Section 9 
presents the weaknesses of IPas++ and our future work. 
Finally, we conclude our paper in Section 10.

3IPas++: A Novel Accountable and Scalable Internet Protocol for Future Internet
and an identity namespace. Recently the identifier/locator 
separation has been considered as an evolutionary path 
towards future Internet in the Internet community. Although 
there has been several related proposals, e.g., APT [11], 
LISP [12], Six/One [13], and GSE [14], in the Internet 
Research Task Force (IRTF), it is still a long way to go 
before reaching maturity, since many key points are still 
unsolved in identifier/locator separation. For example, 
how to define the identifier and locator? How to build an 
identifier-to-locator mapping system? 
IPas++ is a solution based on the basic network model 
provided by identifier/locator separation and could be seen 
as an useful attempt of identifier/locator separation line.
3   Design Space
Before presenting our proposal, we first discuss the 
trust model and network model of IPas++.
3.1 Trust Model
We find it is usual and reasonable that in real-world the 
company to which one staff belongs should be responsible 
to the staff’s actions, for example, consumers usually 
complain Toyota instead of Bill, a lazy and careless staff 
in Toyota, about the quantity problems of vehicles. How 
to encourage employees is just seen as an internal affairs 
which other people out of Toyota don’t care about. 
This observation greatly simulates our inspiration. 
In IPas++ we decompose the Internet into several ARs in 
light of the networks’ organizational relationship. We argue 
that each AR is an independent trust domain and should 
be responsible to the actions of network users in it; that 
is, IPas++ should provide victims with the capability of 
identifying the AR where the attackers hide themselves in, 
and leave the host accountability to the administrators of 
corresponding AR. 
This trust model not only simplifies our design, but also 
be compatible with various existing security technologies 
including Radius [24], SAVE [28], [29-31], etc. In Section 
5, we prove that this level of accountability provided by 
IPas++ is sufficient to defeat prefix hijacking, route forgery, 
source address spoofing and DoS flooding.
3.2 Network Model
We regard the Internet as an union of ARs. Different 
from ASes, the granularity of an AR is variable. For 
example, any isolated ad hoc network could be seen as an 
AR; a campus network or an enterprise network could also 
be treated as an AR; for deploying IPas++ it may be useful 
to regard the current Internet or the global IPv4 network as 
one AR. ARs may adopt diverse networking technologies, 
multiple independent address spaces (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) and 
intra-domain routing approach (e.g., [34], [35]) should 
coexist within IPas++.
To improve scalability, we further separate EARs from 
CARs) similarly to “Map & Encap” [25]. EARs always act 
as sources or sinks for data packets, such as company or 
campus networks in today’s Internet. By contrast, CARs 
comprise the DFZ of the Internet and are used for providing 
data transit service. An AS in today’s Internet fulfills the 
requirements to become a CAR. In the following, we call 
the network composed of all EARs as edge network (EN) 
and the network composed of all CARs as core network 
(CN).
Figure 1 shows two EARs and three CARs. The EAR 
AR4 attaches to AR1, and the multi-homed EAR AR5 
connects to two CARs, AR2 and AR3. In common with APT 
[11], we assume that two EARs can only communicate with 
each other through the core network.
Tunnel Routers (TRs) and Mapping Systems (MSes) 
placed in CARs form a control and management layer 
between edge and core network. Each CAR (e.g., AR1) 
maintains a TR (e.g., TR1) for every EAR (e.g., AR4) 
attaching to it. The TR (e.g., TR1) is responsible to 
encapsulate packets from EAR (e.g., AR4) it connects to 
and de-encapsulate packets from CAR (e.g., AR1) it exists 
in. The MS is used to manage EAR-to-CAR mappings. 
For simplicity, we assume that every CAR maintains only 
one MS, although in fact a CAR can install more MSes to 
increase robustness and decrease latency.

Because how to guarantee the reachability in an AR is 
outside the consideration of our paper, we only describe the 
inter-AR routing in this subsection.

Every EAR (e.g., AR4 in Figure 1) has one or more 
border routers (e.g., BR10) used to maintain a connection 
between it and the tunnel routers (e.g., TR1) of its providers 
(e.g., AR1). The border routers only have a default route for 
inter-AR routing; that is, when a packet sent to a host in 
other AR arrives at the border router, the border router just 
forwards it to the CAR it connects to. 
4.2.2 Routing Between CARs
We design IPas++ to route at the granularity of CAR in 
core network. Apart from that, the inter-AR routing in core 
network is the same as BGP.
Table 2 illustrates the routing table of core routers (CR3, 
CR6, CR9) in Figure 1. As shown in Table 2, core routers 
of CARs maintain routing information on a per-AR basis. 
Their routing tables map destination AR identifier to “next 
hop” and does not contain any information about LUA. 
Table 2 The Routing Table in Core Network
Router Destnation Interface Next_hop
CR3 d2 eth0 d2:r6,0
CR3 d3 eth1 d3:r9,0
CR6 d1 eth0 d2:r3,0
CR6 d3 eth1 d3:r9,1
CR9 d1 eth0 d1:r3,1
CR9 d2 eth1 d2:r6,1
In parallel with this, instead of being used to distribute 
reachability information of IP prefixes in BGP, the update 
message exchanged by any two adjacent CAR border router 
is used to either advertise a feasible route to a specific AR 
identifier or withdraw infeasible routes to some CARs.
4.3 Forwarding
Figure 1 illustrates the packets forwarding in IPas++. 
Obviously, it is an indirect communication model. We 
suppose that E11 in AR4 plans to communicate with E14 in 
AR5:

Figure 4 Logic Format of Packets
 y Step 1: E11 sends first packet P to BR10, as illustrated 
by F.1 in Figure 1. P (The logic format of P is shown in 
Figure 4) includes an IP Header and an IPas++ Header. 
The format of the IP header (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc.) is 
decided by the networking technology used in AR4. The 
IPas++ header is uniform, and is used to carry the GUA 
of E11 and E14. After P arrives at BR10, BR10 sends it to 
TR1.
 y Step 2: As illustrated by F.2 in Figure 1, TR1 firstly 
queries its cache for the mapping to the destination d5 in 
IPas++ Header. Yet if the mapping does not exist, TR1 
sends a request to the mapping server MS1.
 y Step 3:  MS1 looks up in  i ts  mapping database 
and then sends a reply (containing the mapping 
M2(d5)) to TR1, as illustrated by F.3 in Figure 1. 
When TR1 receives this reply, it firstly stores) in 
its cache and then chooses d2:r4,0 as AR5’s locator 
because the priority of d2:r4,0 is higher than that of 
d3:r7,0 in M2(d5) (as shown in Table 1). Afterwards, TR1 
appends an Encap header with source locator d1:r1,0 and 
destination locator d2:r4,0 to P (as shown in Figure 4) and 
then forwards the new packet P' in the core network.
 y Step 4: After forwarding in core network, P’ arrives at 
TR4, as illustrated by F.4 in Figure 1.
 y Step 5: As illustrated by F.5 in Figure 1, TR4 strips the 
Encap header, and then forwards the raw packet to BR13. 
Afterwards, BR13 sends the packet to endpoint E14. 
Figure 5 shows a basic design of the IPas++ Header 
and Encap header that contains variable length IPas++ 
addresses. The traffic class and flow label fields borrowed 
from IPv6 header are devoted to provide quality of service 
(QoS). The border/core router of an AR should be capable 
of setting the corresponding field of IP header (e.g., the 
type of service (ToS) field in IPv4 header) according to 
the semantic of these two fields. To make processing the 
IPas++ address easier, the header contains the length of 
IPas++ addresses, “Src len” and “Dest len”. These 8-bit 
values indicate the number of bytes present in the IPas++ 
addresses. Still take the communication from E11 to E14 
as an example, if AR4 is IPv4 network and AR5 is IPv6 
network, the value of “Src len” field and “Dest len” field in 
IPas++ Header would be 16 and 28, respectively.

7IPas++: A Novel Accountable and Scalable Internet Protocol for Future Internet
5.1 Control Plane
IPas++ could use S-BGP [3] (with minor modifications) 
to secure its control plane, including the mapping system 
and the inter-domain routing. 
Since the secure foundation provided by today’s 
Internet is just a quicksand, S-BGP needs a trusted 
certificate authority and a trusted address registry to work 
well. As mentioned above, this problematic requirement 
becomes a tremendous obstacle to its deployment. 
However, S-BGP can be deployed on IPas++ without 
difficulty. On the one hand, in IPas++ the public keys of 
ARs need not be certified by any authority, as an entity can 
verify the authenticity of another entity by only checking 
if it holds the appropriate private key corresponding to the 
public key tied with its self-certifying identifier. On the 
other hand, because the core network is much more stable 
than edge network and the mapping between EAR and 
CARs is more static than network topology, IPas++ could 
greatly decrease the overhead introduced by S-BGP.
5.1.1 Secure Session Between Neighboring ARs
Since every AR owns a public/private key pair, IPas++ 
could use any automatic negotiation protocol to build a 
secure session between neighboring peers. For example, 
one of those solutions, IKEv2 [26] , is able to perform 
mutual authentication and establish a security association 
between two peers. 
5.1.2 Secure Routing Between CARs
As mentioned above, every CAR can only announce 
its own self-certifying identifier. Thus if all CARs sign its 
routing announcements using a unifying hash algorithm 
and their own private keys, because only the CAR owning 
the private key associated with the self-certifying identifier 
appearing in the route message can generate authentic 
signature, hijacking and route forgery must come to an 
end. Here we list the basic operations to secure routing 
between CARs: (1) each CAR should cache all the 
public keys of other CARs; (2) each CAR should sign its 
routing announcements similarly to S-BGP; (3) before 
accepting a routing announcement, each CAR should firstly 
authenticate signatures chain in this announcement.
5.1.3 Secure Mapping Distribution
IPas++ design defines a delegation attestation (DA) 
to secure mapping distribution. DA contains the signature 
of mapping and is used to prove that a CAR is authorized 
by an EAR to advertise or withdraw the mapping between 
them. DA is similar to the address attestation in S-BGP, so 
for simplicity, we don’t give the detailed DA format.
When an EAR dx switches provider from dy to another 
CAR dz for the first time, dx firstly registers the mapping m 
= {(dx, dz: fj(z),k(z), s, w)} and delegation attestation dax,z on 
dz's mapping server MSz. Then, MSz advertises m with dax,z 
encapsulated in a BGP attribute onto the mapping system.
Because dx signs m using the private key corresponding 
to the public key tied with its identifier, and the signature 
is stored in dax,z, it is easy for other mapping servers to 
authentic m. Assume that MSb receives m and dx, MSb 
firstly looks up the public key tied with dx in its cache, and 
then uses this public key verify dax,z. If the verification 
is successful, MSb needs to further determine whether m 
is new: (1) if there is no mapping about dx and dz in MSb, 
MSb should add m to its mapping table and then further 
advertises m and dax,z to its peers. (2) If there has been a 
mapping about dx and dz in MSb, but the “stamp” of m is 
higher than that of extant mapping, MSb also needs to add 
m to its mapping table and advertise m and dax,z to its peers. 
(3) Otherwise, MSb discards m 
In addition, dx should send another DA to dy. Thus dy's 
mapping server can securely withdraw n = {(dx, dy: fj(y),k(y), 
s', w')} by sending out a withdrawal message onto the 
mapping system.
5.2 Data Plane
Source address spoofing and DoS flooding are primary 
challenges faced by IP data plane and nasty problems in 
current Internet. Once IPas++ can provide accountability, 
many extant solutions [4-5] against these two threats are 
able to run in full power. 
Firstly, Internet Ingress Filtering [27], SAVE [28] and 
other light-weight source authentication schemes could be 
deployed within an AR. The design space inside an AR left 
by IPas++ provides great flexibility to these technologies. 
Secondly, Passport [5] authenticates the source of 
a packet to the granularity of the origin AS. Because 
either AS in traditional Internet or AR in IPas++ could be 
treated as a trust and fate-sharing unit, Passport could be 
transplanted to IPas++ naturally. In addition, the principal 
mean of Passport is using symmetric-key cryptography to 
place tokens on packets in order to allow each AS along 
the network path to independently verify if an source 
address is valid, thereby how to distribute the symmetric 
keys securely becomes the cornerstone of Passport security. 
Passport design uses a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and 
concludes that the exchange is secure, as long as routing is 
secure. So with removing the deployment and performance 
hurdle for S-BGP, IPas++ clears the way for Passport.
Thirdly, capability-based schemes [4] could be used 
in a more efficient way to stop possible DoS flooding in 
IPas++. With capability-based scheme, nodes in IPas++ 
must first obtain permission, a token in the form of 
capabilities, from the receiver. The sender then includes 
these tokens in packets to enable verification points 
distributed around the network to check that traffic has been 
certified as legitimate by both destination and the path in 
between, and hence to cleanly discard unauthorized traffic

9IPas++: A Novel Accountable and Scalable Internet Protocol for Future Internet
  (1)
For simplicity, we suppose the considered network is 
light-load, so all of lost packets retransmission, queuing 
delay and processing delay could be ignored. Thus, T(M) 
can be computed as:
  (2)
Here, j corresponds to the total amount of links from 
source to destination; R corresponds to the transmission 
speed of each link.
As shown in Table 4, from Figure 4, [36-37],[12]
[6], we can get the packet header size ni (n of IPas++), 
n4(n of IPv4), n6 (n of IPv6), nl4 (n of LISP using IPv4), 
nl6 (n of LISP using IPv6), na (n of AIP) in core network. 
While computing ni, we use a typical network scenario, 
in which EARs are IPv6 networks and CARs are IPv4 
networks. While computing na, we use a general network 
scenario, in which each endpoint’s address has the format 
as AD1:AD2:EID. 
Table 4 Packet Header Size (Byte)
ni 124 n4 20 n6 40
nl4 56 nl6 96 na 138
Assume K = 1,500 bytes, j = 6, R = 100 MB/s (Note 
that the value of j and R will not affect the comparison 
result). Thus, from (1), (2) and Table 4, we can get Ti(M ), 
T4(M ), T6(M ), Tl4(M ), Tl6(M ), and Ta(M ).
Figure 8 shows that: (1) as M increases, all of Ti(M ), 
T4(M ), T6(M ), Tl4(M ), Tl6(M ), and Ta(M ) grow accordingly, 
and they are of the same order of magnitude. This means 
that in terms of T, the performances of IPas++, IPv4, IPv6, 
LISP using IPv4, LISP using IPv6 and AIP are all of the 
same level. (2) for any value of M, Ta(M ) > Ti(M ) > Tl6(M ) 
> Tl4(M ) > T6(M ) > T4(M ). So it is clear that in terms of T, 
the performance of IPas++ is worse than that of IPv4, IPv6 
and LISP, but better than that of AIP. As a consequence 
of the above two observations, we say the performance of 
IPas++ is acceptable.
8   Deployment
We compare the deployment of IPas++, LISP, AIP and 
IPa+. The metrics borrowed from [7] are: the components 
that need to upgrade and the type of upgrade.
Figure 9 lists our comparison results. It is clear that 
IPas++ needs fewer modifications to current Internet than 
AIP, but more modifications than IPa+ and LISP. However, 
the scalability of IPa+ is still based on the aggregatable 
feature of IP addresses similarly to current Internet, so 
along with the explosive growth of the Internet, the RIB 
size and BGP messages in IPa+ would grow at an alarming 
rate again. Meanwhile, LISP lacks essential security 
consideration, similarly to the Internet. Hence, considering

Abstract— This work proposes a novel reader deployment 
mechanism for RFID applications used in daily life activities. Two 
aspects of the proposed mechanism are discussed: optimizing RFID 
reader deployment and adjusting reading speed to minimize reader 
collision. Tabu search strategy is used to find the better locations of 
deploying readers. Reader deployment performance is analyzed in 
terms of deployment cost, reader collision, system throughput and 
hit-miss ratio. Compared to traditional dense mechanisms, the 
proposed mechanism has a 36% lower deployment cost and a 34% 
lower average collision rate with only minor sacrifice of system 
throughput or hit-miss ratio.

Search, Optimal Deployment 
 
 I. INTRODUCTION 
RFID is widely used in the modern life. RFID reader 
deployment is an important issue on RFID applications [1]. 
There are many concerns in deploying RFID readers, such as 
the reader  collision, the power of signal, the interference of 
SNR, the direction of the antenna, system throughput and 
hit-query ratio.  The virtual reader model and the adaptive 
power control strategy are developed to adjust readers’ 
coverage in this study. Based on the Tabu search scheme, this 
study proposes a novel deployment mechanism to achieve 
optimal deployment with the least number of readers in RFID 
service networks. 
 II. PROBLEM DEFINITION 
RFID technology applies Radio Frequency (RF) 
transmitting/receiving signals in the air, which communicate 
each other via radio signals.  RFID readers query tags ID and 
then obtain ID information from tag memory.  However, 
with the same frequency signal sent simultaneously on the 
overlapping interrogation zones by different readers or tags 
will leads to some interference.  The space is referred to as 
the interrogation zone. The interference refers to the collision 
of different radio signals with the same frequency in RFID 
system will lead to distorted signals received [2]. The RFID 
collision problems include tag-to-tag, tag-to-reader, and 
reader-to-reader collision [3]. 
This study mainly provides RFID readers deployment 
mechanism, which uses mobile RFID readers to find out the 
better locations in pipelines, that is able to read more tags and 
decreases the interference by other readers. Figure 1 illustrates 
the proposed application environment. This environment is 
divided into multiple regions and every region contains 
immovable RFID tags and information gateway. The 
information gateway stores the unique ID data of RFID tags in 
the connection table. This study can utilize this table to 
calculate the Query-hiT ratio (QT) in one of the regions. So if 
any new RFID tag will join into the regions, it must notify the 
information gateway to record its unique ID data. Every 
region can be monitored by multiple RFID readers. If RFID 
tags have been read by readers, the information gateway 
would receive RFID reading events, which mark “read” tag in 
its connection table. Every RFID reader can arbitrarily move 
to search better location by means of intelligent RFID 
deployment agent. This scenario can be suitable for fixed 
RFID tag applications, such as goods management, personal 
monitoring and object tracking. 
 
 
 Figure 1. RFID Service Scenario 
 
Figure 4. Testbed for RFID Reader Deployment 
 
Figure 5 shows the comparison between dense mechanism 
and proposed mechanism. Before dense mechanism beginning 
to deploy RFID readers in best locations, this mechanism 
analyzes the locations of RFID tags and size of deployment 
area in advance. Consequently, dense mechanism has more 
maximum system throughput than other mechanisms. But 
dense mechanism needs large deployment time and has high 
probability of reader-to-reader collisions. On the other hand, 
the proposed mechanism uses moving readers to find better 
locations rely on deployment agent, but the proposed 
mechanism has low system throughput compared with dense 
mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism has less 
deployment time and light reader-to-reader collisions. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. System Throughput 
 
 
 
Figure 6 illustrates the dense mechanism has high 
deployment cost compared with the proposed mechanism. 
This study defines the cost function as follows: 
 
Cost (Tag number) = (Number of Reader/Number of 
Readermax) + (Deployment Time/Deployment Timemax) + 
(SNR/Rrequined) 
 
The different categories of effecting factors are fairly 
transformed into general decimal point, and can be summed to 
be the total deployment cost. As figure 6 shows the 
deployment cost approximately lies in between 0 and 2. This 
study verifies that the proposed mechanism has less 
deployment cost related to the dense mechanism. 
 
 
Figure 6. Deployment Cost  
 
Figure 7 illustrates the dense mechanism has low hit miss 
ratio due to intensive deployment way. The proposed 
mechanism has increased 4% of hit miss ratio comparing with 
dense mechanism.

Abstract 
This paper constructs a Ubiquitous-Life Home Networking System by combining the EPC Framework of 
RFID technology and OSGi service platform. User uses a mobile device such as a smart phone or a PDA to 
download and start the bundle services on the OSGi service platform. Home appliances are equipped with a 
RFID reader in intelligent home environments. We use the EPC code recognizable by EPC network to 
execute the object tracing function for inquiring related information (EPCIS). User can make a purchase 
through a smart phone with RFID Reader. A Content Web Server and an ODS Server are responsible for 
recording the commodity information by EPC Code. This integration realizes the U-Life Home Networking 
System by using the RFID/EPC Network and OSGi Framework.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A RFID system consists of Readers and RFID Tags. It has many applications in our daily lives. For 
example, EasyCard and electronic toll collection (ETC) intelligent card, etc. The EPC (Electronic Product 
Code) is the most important design in the RFID system [1]. It uniquely identifies a product so the EPC code 
is the only number of an object in the information system. EPC can be used in automatic identification 
technology without requiring human operation. Hence, EPC not only marks targets with traditional barcodes, 
it can also be used to identify a single small object, a box, a large container, a truck and even the goods and 
a service. Accessing the global EPC network by EPC and object information [2], we can obtain related 
applications, and build a standard of message exchange platform and related applications. 
The OSGi organization was established in 1999, with the primary purpose of constructing an open 
standard interface to enable wide area network services to communicate with home networking equipment 
[3]. The OSGi standard, based on Java technology, enables service operators, manufacturers of household 
This paper is the partial result of project no. NSC 98-2221-E-143-002-MY2 conducted by National 
Taitung University under the sponsorship of National Science Council, R.O.C. 
A concept and architecture of Mobile Purchasing System with Smart Phone and EPC Network are 
proposed in figure 2 [6]. Three servers are set up in the EPC network experimental scenario: Root ONS, 
Local ONS and EPCIS. The authors use the Web Service to implement the connections between the ONS 
and EPCIS. Clients use Mobile RFID Smart Phone to operate the order processes. The RFID/EPC 
framework is illustrated in the paper but the authors do not provide the concept of OSGi in the intelligent 
home environment.

III. IMPLEMENTION OF U-LIFE SYSTEM 
This paper implements the U-life home network system with RFID/EPC framework and OSGi platform. 
In this study, we use RFID reader to get the EPC code, and combine the EPC network and OSGi Gateway to 
realize the U-life home networking. The system collects and tracks the product information with EPC codes 
in the intelligent house environment. Also the intelligent RFID appliances send the information to the user 
actively. We use the following two scenarios as examples to demonstrate the U-Life Home Networking 
System:  
4. After connecting to the home OSGi server, it can download and start the Bundle services to search 
the goods information in the database.(EXP date or stock information) 
5. Also, other smart RFID household appliances can inquire the goods information with this system. 
By starting OSGi Bundle services, the proposed system sends the information through the Internet to 
mobile devices such as cell phone and PDA handheld devices. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
The applications of OSGi platform have been used in many different places. In this paper, our goal is to 
make the shopping more convenient with the EPC network and the OSGi platform by using the smart 
mobile devices. The design and implementation of U-Life Home Networking System are proposed in this 
paper. Also we provide two scenarios for purchasing actions in U-life digital home applications. User can 
obtain the status of goods in the U-Life home environment anytime and anywhere. Besides, this system can 
provide more bundles and services as needed. When combined with the RFID/EPC network and the mobile 
technology, it can make U-life home environment more perfect in the future.

2. Campus Security Scenario 
 
This study establishes a set of easy for teachers and parents to master the situation of 
children in school system. In order to express the advantages of the system, the 
following situations for a variety of applications on the program for Help: 
 
z Attend School and Finish Class Notification System  
When the gate sensor senses the students out of school, it will send a message to the 
student safety system; the system will send a message to parents. In addition, parents 
can use search system to query into the students in school situations. 
 
z Student Temperature Anomaly Management System 
Sensors will regularly return student temperature status. Health-care system checks if 
the students return temperature sensor data for anomalies, the alerts will notify 
immediately the office staff for follow-up treatments. 
 
z Hazardous Area Management System 
When the sensor senses the students in the risk areas such as campus corners, top 
floors, swimming pools, high voltage transformer cases, it will send a message to 
student security system. The system immediately notifies teachers and security guard. 
 
z Campus Visitor Management System 
When visitors enter the campus, they have to register and wear an active tag. By the 
returned messages from tags, we can know that the visitors into the area at any time. 
Once visitors enter unauthorized areas, the tag will immediately return a message to 
security guard. 
 
z Campus Equipment Management System 
There is an active RFID tag on important equipment in the campus. Student needs to 
use RFID tags to register and booking important equipments before use. If the students 
do not make an appointment to use, the system can detect the RFID tag that the 
student has not been registered to use in normal way; the system also records the event 
and e-mail teachers and parents. 
 
 
3. RFID Campus Security Service Platform 
 
This study establishes a “Campus Security Service System” for campus security 
planning. In order to keep campus safe, this system deploys five highly advanced 
automatic identification technologies, including “Attend School and Finish Class 
Notification System”, “Student Temperature Anomaly Management System”, 
“Hazardous Area Management System”, “Campus Visitor Management System” and 
“Campus Equipment Management System”. We use the campus network to establish 
active/passive RFID sensors according the campus building architecture shown in 
figure 1.  
 
 
z System Software Framework

    一月十七日搭機至日本羽田機場，在機場大廳見到京急線售票亭，依據研討會的指示，
先搭乘Monorail至濱松町，再由濱松町轉搭地鐵至新宿。東京急線檢票口設計為開放式柵欄，
即便攜有大型行李行動也很方便，國內捷運入口大多設計為柵欄式驗票口，對於大型行李的
旅客似乎還不算便利。雖然東京單軌電車內部空間不算寬廣，但各節車廂設有行李置放區，
對於國際旅客非常便利。

1. Introduction 
 
In recent years, kidnapping children, threatening phone calls and criminal frauds are 
frequent, the safety of school children into school, parents and teachers of attention. 
Besides, elementary school students’ capacity is no completely autonomous, teachers 
cannot always take care of them one by one, leading to the safety of children in school 
often have concerns. Therefore, the major objective of study is to use RFID 
technology in order to plan safe campus environment for students. We focus on 
children to school safety, student health care, campus visitor management and asset 
management related issues. We also integrate active and passive RFID applications 
used in the campus safety issues, which are tailored for educational institutions. This 
study established the RFID Campus Security Service Platform with automatic 
identification technology in order to achieve the purpose of maintaining student 
campus safety. Through the system implementation, using RFID technology to help 
teachers mastering the students’ whereabouts, temperature conditions, strayed into 
dangerous areas and the enhancement of visitor management, so that children can be 
in a safer campus environment.

Abstract— This work proposes a novel reader deployment 
mechanism for RFID applications used in daily life activities. Two 
aspects of the proposed mechanism are discussed: optimizing RFID 
reader deployment and adjusting reading speed to minimize reader 
collision. Tabu search strategy is used to find the better locations of 
deploying readers. Reader deployment performance is analyzed in 
terms of deployment cost, reader collision, system throughput and 
hit-miss ratio. Compared to traditional dense mechanisms, the 
proposed mechanism has a 36% lower deployment cost and a 34% 
lower average collision rate with only minor sacrifice of system 
throughput or hit-miss ratio.  
 
Keywords—RFID, Virtual Reader, Adaptive Power Control, Tabu 
Search, Optimal Deployment 
 
 I. INTRODUCTION 
RFID is widely used in the modern life. RFID reader 
deployment is an important issue on RFID applications [1]. 
There are many concerns in deploying RFID readers, such as 
the reader  collision, the power of signal, the interference of 
SNR, the direction of the antenna, system throughput and 
hit-query ratio.  The virtual reader model and the adaptive 
power control strategy are developed to adjust readers’ 
coverage in this study. Based on the Tabu search scheme, this 
study proposes a novel deployment mechanism to achieve 
optimal deployment with the least number of readers in RFID 
service networks. 
 II. PROBLEM DEFINITION 
RFID technology applies Radio Frequency (RF) 
transmitting/receiving signals in the air, which communicate 
each other via radio signals.  RFID readers query tags ID and 
then obtain ID information from tag memory.  However, 
with the same frequency signal sent simultaneously on the 
overlapping interrogation zones by different readers or tags 
will leads to some interference.  The space is referred to as 
the interrogation zone. The interference refers to the collision 
of different radio signals with the same frequency in RFID 
system will lead to distorted signals received [2]. The RFID 
collision problems include tag-to-tag, tag-to-reader, and 
reader-to-reader collision [3]. 
This study mainly provides RFID readers deployment 
mechanism, which uses mobile RFID readers to find out the 
better locations in pipelines, that is able to read more tags and 
decreases the interference by other readers. Figure 1 illustrates 
the proposed application environment. This environment is 
divided into multiple regions and every region contains 
immovable RFID tags and information gateway. The 
information gateway stores the unique ID data of RFID tags in 
the connection table. This study can utilize this table to 
calculate the Query-hiT ratio (QT) in one of the regions. So if 
any new RFID tag will join into the regions, it must notify the 
information gateway to record its unique ID data. Every 
region can be monitored by multiple RFID readers. If RFID 
tags have been read by readers, the information gateway 
would receive RFID reading events, which mark “read” tag in 
its connection table. Every RFID reader can arbitrarily move 
to search better location by means of intelligent RFID 
deployment agent. This scenario can be suitable for fixed 
RFID tag applications, such as goods management, personal 
monitoring and object tracking. 
 
 
 Figure 1. RFID Service Scenario 
 
Figure 4. Testbed for RFID Reader Deployment 
 
Figure 5 shows the comparison between dense mechanism 
and proposed mechanism. Before dense mechanism beginning 
to deploy RFID readers in best locations, this mechanism 
analyzes the locations of RFID tags and size of deployment 
area in advance. Consequently, dense mechanism has more 
maximum system throughput than other mechanisms. But 
dense mechanism needs large deployment time and has high 
probability of reader-to-reader collisions. On the other hand, 
the proposed mechanism uses moving readers to find better 
locations rely on deployment agent, but the proposed 
mechanism has low system throughput compared with dense 
mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism has less 
deployment time and light reader-to-reader collisions. 
 
 
 
Figure 5. System Throughput 
 
 
 
Figure 6 illustrates the dense mechanism has high 
deployment cost compared with the proposed mechanism. 
This study defines the cost function as follows: 
 
Cost (Tag number) = (Number of Reader/Number of 
Readermax) + (Deployment Time/Deployment Timemax) + 
(SNR/Rrequined) 
 
The different categories of effecting factors are fairly 
transformed into general decimal point, and can be summed to 
be the total deployment cost. As figure 6 shows the 
deployment cost approximately lies in between 0 and 2. This 
study verifies that the proposed mechanism has less 
deployment cost related to the dense mechanism. 
 
 
Figure 6. Deployment Cost  
 
Figure 7 illustrates the dense mechanism has low hit miss 
ratio due to intensive deployment way. The proposed 
mechanism has increased 4% of hit miss ratio comparing with 
dense mechanism.
