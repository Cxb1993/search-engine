前言
環氧樹酯(epoxy molding compound, EMC)普遍使用於電子封裝產品中，因此對於其性
質的相關研究顯得相對重要。而在製程中，封膠充填之後的產品翹曲，一直是封裝工程師
的困擾。而藉由不斷地調整製程參數，可以或多或少地解決這問題，即：降低產品的翹曲
量至可接受的程度。而從成本及效率的觀點考量，經由模擬的方式來代替實地測試各種製
程參數的方式來得到最佳的一組製程參數，似乎是較理想的。
一般的高分子材料在高溫、長時間的環境之下，會顯現出黏彈性，因此，電子封裝產品
中的 EMC材料在後熟化(post mold cure, PMC)的製程中，必會產生黏彈性。在對包含 EMC
材料的結構進行力學方面的分析時，必須考慮材料的黏彈性，尤其是在高溫、長時間的環
境之下。而熱固性(thermosetting)塑膠的諸多特性則會隨著材料熟化度的增加而改變，因
此，要詳細描述在整個後熟化過程中，材料性質的變化有相當的難度。
研究目的
如前所述，為了要用模擬的方式得到最佳的製程參數，所以，首先要先得到最正確的模
擬方法。在本研究中，在不同的環境下，利用不同的原理來進行模擬。在充填製成完結的
時候，利用 P-V-T-C關係式來模擬產品的翹曲。而在充填製成完結、進行後熟化製程時，
則利用熱固性材料的玻璃轉化溫度改變的原理來進行模擬。
同時為了要模擬材料在後熟化的特性，所以要先建立材料的黏彈模型。更進一步地，要
完整地描述材料特性，因此將材料的熟化度也納為材料黏彈模型的參數。
文獻探討
近幾十年來，塑膠封裝在電子產業變得普及。EMC(epoxy molding compound)材料因為
價格低及較佳的環境抵抗力而用於塑膠封裝。在長時間、高溫下，塑膠材料會產生黏彈性。
因此，在像後熟化製程中(長時間、高溫之下)，分析 EMC材料時必須考慮材料的黏彈性。
Sindee及其團隊[1]建立了商用環氧樹酯的熟化模型，以及利用溫度-時間疊加原理也成
功地預測了完全熟化環氧樹酯的黏彈性。另外，也建立出了玻璃轉移溫度與熟化度之間的
關係式。在 Ernst的團隊[2,3]的研究中，也發現了環氧樹酯的黏彈性會受溫度及熟化度的
影響。實驗中也發現添加物的濃度也會影響黏彈性，橡膠態模數與添加物的體積百分比之
間的關係式也被找出。建立出來的環氧樹酯黏彈模型也被用來模擬 QFN的翹曲量。有限原
素法模擬的結果顯示出因溫度變化及熟化度所產生的翹曲量的百分比，而所有的結果皆顯
示熟化度所導致的翹曲量不可忽略。在[4]的研究中，描述了不同類型的材料測試結果與鬆
弛模數之間的關係。此外，固定應變率拉伸測試的結果也用彈性模數的觀念來解釋，而且，
若是材料為現黏彈性的話，應變率對於測試結果也不影響。在[5]的研究中，鬆弛模數的觀
念與[4]相同。這些觀念說明：在頻率領域的測試結果(E”與 E’)，可以轉換成時間領域的結
果(E(t))。在[6]的研究中，黏彈模型藉著有限原素法用來預測試片的曲率，模擬結果顯示：
黏彈模型比線彈性模形模擬更能接近實驗結果。在[7]的研究中，黏彈模型被用來預測固定
應變率拉伸測試的結果，也建立了在不同應變之下的黏彈模型。在[8]的研究中，進行了在
不同應變之下的應力鬆弛實驗。由實驗的結果發現鬆弛模數與溫度、施加的應變相關。
研究方法
為了要建立黏彈模型[1,2,3]，現今的黏彈研究要用到 DMA。在實際應用層面，鬆弛模數
是最重要的黏彈特性。然而。利用 DMA來找 E”與 E’是較方便的。為了工程上的應用，在
其中，E(t)為鬆弛模數；t為時間；N為元素的數目；Ci為第 i個元素的係數；λi為第 i
個元素的鬆弛時間；E(∞)為時間為無限大時的鬆弛模數；E(0)為時間為零時的鬆弛模數。
廣義麥斯威爾模型可用來對主曲線做曲線嵌合，如圖 3。藉著修改模型中的參數，可找
出較適合的曲線。本研究模型的參數 N為 10，其它廣義麥斯威爾模型的參數值列於表 1。
廣義麥斯威爾模型與主曲線的比較列於圖 5。
原始 aC實驗結果列於表 2。熟化度轉移因子(aC)實驗結果繪成圖列於圖 7。25℃之下的
實驗結果可以下關係式來近似。在圖 7中，實線為關係式，圖中所涵蓋的熟化度範圍為 0.7
至 1.0。
log(aC)=555.87C3-1304.7C2+1017.7C-268.99 (6)
在 30℃及 40℃之下，結果也類似。
綜合以上關係式，可以得到在 25℃之下的不同熟化度的應力鬆弛曲線，如圖 8所示。
本研究建立了 Hitachi Chemical CEL-9200 EMC的黏彈模型與WLF公式。實驗主曲線
的範圍涵蓋了 1026秒。而藉著轉換式[4][5]將 DMA的測量結果轉變成鬆弛模數。
用來找出對應特定熟化度的熟化度轉移因子的實驗已完成，而包含熟化度與熟化度轉移
因子的方程式也被提出。
WLF公式藉著溫度與溫度轉移因子(aT)之間的關係，可以決定不同溫度之下的廣義麥斯
威爾模型。同理，透過所提出的熟化度轉移因子(aC)與熟化度的關係式，也可以決定不同熟
化度之下的廣義麥斯威爾模型。因此，建立了以時間、溫度、熟化度為參數的黏彈模型。
除此之外，本 model亦可使用在 underfill材料，不一樣的地方只有在 Maxwell model、 aT
及 aC所使用的 model及係數不一樣，如圖 9所示。Underfill aC之model可由(7)所示。
logac=64*C6-22*C5-67.35*C4-119.09*C3+254.1*C2-121.66*C+12 (7)
由此可見，此 model為一共通且可以共用來形容熱固性材料在不同的熟化度下的材料性
質。經由有限單元法的計算，亦發現此 model可以精確的預測環氧樹脂與底部充膠材料的
機械行為。

B. Cure/compressibility shrinkage analysis
The constitutive equation governing the
volume change due to pressure, temperature
and degree of cure is called the P-V-T-C
relation and was obtained from Hwang’s
research [7][9]. The equation is described in the
following:
     2 ,1, , , F P TVS P T C F P T C  (6)
Where VS (P, T, C) is the amount of volume
shrinkage and F1 (P, T) and F2 (P, T) are
functions defined as:
1( ) ( ) ( )a bF P,T f T P f T  (7)
2 ( ) ( ) ( )c dF P,T f T P f T  (8)
, ,a b c df f f f are functions of temperature
and are assumed to be in the form:
 22 1 0af T a T a T a   (9)
 22 1 0bf T b T bT b   (10)
 22 1 0cf T c T c T c   (11)
 22 1 0df T d T d T d   (12)
Where 2 0a a , 2 0b b , 2 0c c , 2 0d d are
parameters which can be obtained by curve
fitting the results of material experiment. C is
the conversion that can be calculated from
Eqn(5.1a).
Assume that the original volume of EMC
was a unit volume with unit length in the x, y, z
directions, and then volume after cure reaction
could be expressed as below:
   3 31 1 1 3C C CV L       (13)
Where CV was the volume after
cure/compression, L was the displacement
and C was the cure/compression induced
strain. Assume the pressure variation in the part
was neglected and the temperature was
isothermal during specific packing processes,
then volume shrinkage could be simplified and
expressed as the following:

6ANSYS to solve the thermal
induced warpage. Finally, the
amount of warpage was the sum
of both results of
cure/compression shrinkage and
thermal shrinkage. The flow chart
of warpage simulation was shown
in Figure 7.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
The simulation results and S/N ratio were
listed in Table 7. The Warp1, Warp2, Warp3 and
Warp4 were the amount of warpage of point 1
to 4 respectively as shown in Figure 6. From
Table 7, the interactions between the four
factors were calculated and listed in Table 8.
The effects and S/N ratio of four factors were
showed in Figures 9 and 10. In addition to
these Tables and Figures, some results were
listed: (1) In this package, the amount of
warpage was significantly influenced by Factor
B (packing pressure) and Factor C (curing
time), but was slightly influenced by Factor A
(mold temperature) and factor D (filling
pressure). (2) The higher were packing pressure
and curing time, the higher was the mount of
warpage. The higher was the mold temperature,
the lower was the amount of warpage. (3)
Figure 9 showed that the close to optimal factor
level was A3B1C1D1. (4) The rank of
importance of the four factors to the amount of
warpage was Factor B (packing pressure) >
Factor C (curing time) > Factor A (mold
temperature) > Factor D (filling pressure). (5)
The predicted amount of warpage with optimal
factor level (A3B1C1D1) which was calculated
from the L9-orghogonal array was 0.0547 mm.
Conclusions
In this study, a three-dimensional finite
element model was established for warpage
simulation. The amount of warpage was
calculated by combined the P-V-T-C equation
and CTE of materials. L9 orthogonal array and
S/N charts of Taguchi method were employed
to investigate the contribution of these
processing parameters to the amount of
warpage in a package. Experimental
verification of the close to optimal condition
A3B1C1D1 was executed as shown in Figure
10. From Figure 10, it was observed that the
experiment results were in good agreement
with the predicted value of warpage. The
relative importance of contribution of the
processing parameters were packing pressure >
curing time > mold temperature > filling
pressure. The above results could be useful
information for the molding engineers in IC
packaging industry.

ABSTRACT
During the encapsulation process of IC packages, when
epoxy molding compound (EMC) is filling the mold cavity and
cured in the mold, adhesion effects occur in the interface
between EMC and mold surface. Adhesion effects can cause
many problems. For example, too large an adhesion force
may damage an IC during ejection and cause the package to fail
and thus lower the yield rate and reliability. To get rid of the
mold adhesion problems, improving the mold design and
applying suitable surface treatments such as mold surface
coating are the common approaches. Applying suitable
surface coating is a more popular and practical approach.
How to evaluate the mold adhesion force and use the data to
improve products yield rate are the main issues for packaging.
This paper uses a semi-automatic EMC adhesion force test
instrument that had been developed and fabricated to measure
normal and shear adhesion forces between the mold surface and
EMC. By measuring the adhesion force, one can judge how
much does a specific type of surface treatment help in reducing
the amount of mold adhesion force. Nine kinds of various
mold surface coating were tested with this instrument to
measure the magnitude of adhesion force between EMC to
determine the effectiveness of mold coating. The measured
data showed that with different coatings on mold surface, the
mold adhesion force can be very different. This paper also
discussed the issue of successive normal force test. Engineers
would use the most effective mold coating material to execute
the continuous normal adhesion experiment. The variation of
normal force during successive molding test could be used to
predict the time for mold cleaning. By counting the total
number of shots when the normal force begins to rise, engineers
can accurately predict the number of shots for a specific kind of
mold surface coating to be cleaned.
This paper also described the effects of
defrosting period on mold adhesion force of
EMC. Defrosting is a process to increase the
frozen EMC temperature to room temperature
and stay at room temperature for some time
before molding. It was found by molding
engineers that increased defrosting time period
would increase the frequency of mold cleaning.
But there had been no quantitative description
on how much mold adhesion force increase
during the defrosting process. A
semi-automatic EMC adhesion force test
instrument was used to evaluate the effects of
defrosting period on mold adhesion force of
EMC. It was found that increase the
defrosting time will increase the amount of
14
adhesion force between EMC and mold surface.
STRUCTURE OF THE TEST MACHINE AND MOLD
This experiment used a semi-automatic EMC
normal adhesion force test instrument that had been
developed and fabricated. Also the earlier version
of this instrument was reported before [1]. There
had been some modification in this newer version of
machine.
The main difference between this instrument
and the earlier version of this instrument was:
1. The transfer pot of the instrument was moved to
a new position which was different from the
mold cavity to make this instrument better
simulating the real automold or transfer mold
process.
2. The actuators of the clamping system and the
injection unit were changed to servo motors to
reduce the amount of vibration induced at the
moment when the top mold was opened.
3. The mold was modified to a 3-plate type mold
as shown in Figure 1.
In the experiment, the environment should be
maintained with relative humidity of 502and
temperature 231C. This condition is from STD.
ASTM D897-95a. The laboratory needs an
air-conditioner to control the environment.
The instrument was able to handle different
mold surface treatment and to control EMC or mold
temperature, cavity pressure, charge-in time and
charge-out time.
The picture of the test machine is shown in
Figure 2. The geometry of the sample or the
mold shape was also modified. Schematic of
the modified EMC sample was shown in Figure
3. The shape of the sample was pan shaped
very similar to the previous design but with four
nuts shaped columns. The reason for using
pan shaped sample with columns was to provide
a surface for the mold to clamp the sample
when the top surface was pulled and separated
from the top mold surface. The mold opening
speed was less than 2 mm/sec to avoid impact.
ENCAPSULATION PROCESS
The schematic of the test procedure and the
schematic of the test mechanism were shown in
Figures 4 and 5 respectively. The test
procedure was the same as the earlier version of
this machine but with offset injection pot. The
basic cycle was very similar to an automold
machine. Open and clean the mold. → Insert
the pellet. → Heat the EMC pellet. → Close the
mold.→ EMC melt fil the cavity. → Wait 
EMC until it was cured. → Pul the top mold of 
the sample and separate the surface of the mold
and trigger the test. → Eject the sample. → 
Remove the sample.→ The end of one cycle.
When the top mold closed, the motion mold
plate would press the insulation and the test
specimen. The insulation and the test
specimen would press the middle mold plate
and the sample of EMC. The reading of the
load cell was zero at this time. There was a 1
to 2 mm gap between the connecting rod of the
test specimen and the bracket when the mold
was closed. When the top mold opened, the
motion mold platen would rise and pull the test
specimen through the bracket. The
measurement could be done at this moment.
After that, the middle mold plate would be
raised and the molded part of EMC could be
ejected. The load cell was under a tension
load and it could measure the normal mold
adhesion force when the test interface was
separated
NORMAL MOLD ADHESION FORCE EXPERIMENT ITS
RESULTS
The objective of this paper was to discuss the
mold adhesion force measurement. In the first part
of the paper, the focus was to determine the
effectiveness of mold coating materials. We used a
set of optimal process parameters and nine kinds of
various mold surface coating materials to do the
experiments. This set of optimal process
parameters were determined by Taguchi’s method.
The optimal process control factors were shown in
Table 1. There were nine test specimens and coated
with nine kinds of various materials respectively.
Roughness of the mold surface was Ra = 2.0μm.
The type of EMC was EME-G770 and was made by
SUMITOMO Company in Japan. Mold
temperature was set to be 170C. Injection pressure
16
standard deviation of the experiments for each
interval were shown in Table 3. The tendency
picture of average adhesion force for all
experiments was shown in Figure 9. It was
shown that as the defrosting time period of
EMC getting longer, mold adhesion force would
increase. The average mold adhesion force
difference between the cases of one day (24hr)
and the two days (48hr) defrosting of EMC was
8 kgf. The mold adhesion force difference
between the 24hr and 64hr defrosting case of
EMC was 12.45 kgf. Take the average
adhesion force of EMC defrosted for 24hrs as
the base point (0%), the percentage increase of
average adhesion force for other defrosting time
period cases was shown in the fourth row of
Table 3. The average adhesion force of EMC
defrosted for 64hr had already increased about
38%. We inferred that the increase of
adhesion force after increased defrosting time
period was caused by moisture absorption in
EMC. In order to verify this inference, a set of
confirmation experiments was executed. This
time, we took EMC pellets out from the icebox
and put into a moisture-controlled box to
defrost. The relative humidity and
temperature of the moisture-controlled box
were set as 25% and 23±1C. The humidity of
the moisture-controlled box was lower than that
of the environment. After 24 hours defrosting,
the test began. All conditions, parameters and
procedures of the experiments were the same as
the first experiments. The comparison data of
the average adhesion force for the two
experiments were shown in Table 4. The
compared tendency of average adhesion force
for the two experiments were shown in Figure
10. According to the results in Figure 10 and
Table 4, we found that the average values of
adhesion forces of the second experiments were
lower than those of the first experiments. The
data of the second experiments also verified that
as the defrosting time of EMC getting longer,
mold adhesion force would increase. This
results showed that moisture really had
influence on the mold adhesion force. The
influence of moisture during defrosting on the
adhesion force was apparent. As the
defrosting time period getting longer, EMC
absorbs air moisture and thus increase the mold
adhesion force.t i
CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, an effort was presented to
show the usefulness of using the adhesion force
as a design parameter for encapsulation mold.
The normal adhesion force for different surface
coating could be different. The normal
adhesion force could be used to monitor the
effectiveness of the coating. The smaller was
the adhesion force, the longer was the mold
cleaning time. Monitoring the normal
adhesion force could also find the best time for
mold cleaning. For the defrosting time
experiments, the results showed that moisture
really had influence on the mold adhesion force.
The influence of moisture during defrosting on
the adhesion force was apparent. As the
defrosting time period getting longer, EMC
absorbed air moisture and thus increased the
mold adhesion force. Thus, normal adhesion
force could be a useful parameter for molding
engineers. Monitoring the normal adhesion
force could help molding engineers determine
the effectiveness of surface treatment and
determine the best time for mold cleaning and
the defrosting period of EMC.
