一、中文摘要 
產品多樣化一直是廠商重要的競爭策
略，以往廠商單憑經驗與直覺提供多樣的產品
來滿足顧客的需求，但是卻低估了產品多樣化
所需負擔的成本，造成利潤的損失，因此，廠
商該提供多少種類的產品才能達到利潤最大
化便成為一個重要的議題。在封閉迴圈供應鏈
中，廠商除了思考產品多樣化對正向供應鏈的
影響外，亦必須考慮它對逆向供應鏈的影響。
產品種類眾多固然可以滿足顧客多樣化的需
求，但是亦會造成產品退回到再上市的作業複
雜化，進而影響廠商的利潤。為了研究這個議
題，我們發展數學模式來分析單一製造廠商及
多個零售商在產能有限的逆物流供應鏈架構
下，產品多樣化對逆物流供應鏈的影響。我們
建構出利潤方程式，找出最佳回收批量與最佳
利潤的封閉型解，並藉此探討產品多樣性與其
他因素如何影響最佳批量和廠商利潤，最後我
們也探討產品個數如何影響產品回收運送策

Abstract 
Product variety is one of the most 
important advantages in highly competitive 
markets. However, excessive product 
proliferation can hurt the profit margin. 
Therefore, there is increased focus on 
developing a management method for maximal 
profit. In a closed-loop supply chain, product 
proliferation impacts not only the forward 
supply chain, but also the reverse supply chain. 
Although increasing the number of product 
types can better satisfy diverse customer needs, 
complexity in the product recycling, 
remanufacturing, and resale processes may 
erode a firm’s overall profits. In this research, 
we develop a mathematical model for analyzing 
a capacitated reverse supply chain consisting of 
a single manufacturer and multiple retailers. 
Closed-form solutions for the optimal batch size 
and maximal profit are revealed, and managerial 
insights into how the number of products and 
other factors can impact both batch size and 
profit are discussed. Finally, the relationship 
between product proliferation and the choice of 
logistics strategy is investigated.

literatures studying the effect of product 
proliferation such as [10,11]. 
The return rate for each product i,  
i=1,2,…,I, at each retailer n, n=1,2,…N, is 
independent and identical distributed. Because 
to return a product or not is decided randomly 
and independently by individual consumer, we 
assume the return rates follow Poisson 
distribution with mean rate λλλλλ ====== INNin ...... 111 . 
And aggregate return rate is λλ IN

. 
In addition we assume that the value of 
returned product is decreasing in time. Typical 
example is computer, communication, consumer 
electronics or so-called 3C products. This kind 
of products has short lifecycle because of 
progress of technology. There are often newer 
and better products in one or two years and the 
value of the product erode rapidly with 
respected to time. Consequently remanufacturer 
must shorten the lead time between product 
return to resale in the second market. The 
discount rate is denoted as β . The higher the β , 
the faster the value is eroded. 
Hence, the remanufacturer will want to 
retrieve product form retailers more frequently 
to shorten the lead time. However, because the 
remanufacturer must pay a fixed shipping cost 
FS which may be the expense of dispatching a 
truck or salesperson to retrieve product form 
retailers, the remanufacturer cannot afford to 
collect returned products too often. Hence, it 
must wait for the quantity of return product 
reach a certain batch size q to retrieve those 
products. The optimal batch size, q, to maximize 
discounted profit is the decision variable in our 
model. VS is the variable shipping cost. 
The unit inventory holding cost is h. First 
come first serve is used as the priority rule when 
the returned products arrive at the 
remanufacturing site. According to Guide et al. 
[12] the variance of remanufacturing time is 
higher than new product manufacturing time. 
We assume that unit process time is a random 
variable following general distribution with 
mean process time t and standard deviationσ . 
We also assume that the process for 
remanufacturing is flexible. Hence, the product 
change over time can be ignored.  This 
assumption is suitable for the remanufacturing 
of many 3C products such as personal computer 
and cellular phone. 
The unit remanufacturing variable cost and 
unit selling price of remanufactured products are 
denoted by VC and P with respectively. The 
remanufacturer will sell remanufactured 
products to the secondary market. The reverse 
supply chain structure is shown in Fig. 1.

that the probability that the remanufacturing 
facility is idle is minimized. 
In this section, we will explore the effect 
of product variety on the logistics strategies of 
returned products. If the remanufacturer adopts 
the outsourcing strategy the fixed shipping cost 
FS  will be zero. Let OVS be the unit variable 
shipping cost of outsourcing strategy. *Opi  be 
the optimal profit of adopting the outsourcing 
strategy. The optimal profit of in-house strategy 
is denoted by *Ipi in this section. *Ipi will always 
better than *Opi  when VFOV SSS +> .And *Opi  will 
always better than *Ipi  when VFOV SqSS +< / . In 
both scenarios, the choice of logistic strategy is 
obvious. Thus we assume 
that VFOVVF SqSSSS +>>+ / . Using similar approach 
to derive (2) we get

(3) 
Because Proposition 1 states *Ipi is convex 
decreasing in I and (3) states *Opi is independent 
of I. Thus the remanufacturer is more inclined 
to adopt in-house strategy when the number of 
products offered is small and adopt the 
outsourcing strategy when the number of 
products offered is large. As shown in Fig. 2, 
the remanufacturer will switch its logistic 
strategy from in-house to outsourcing when the 
number of product offered is larger than the 
switch point SI . And we call SI  logistic 
strategy switching point.

Next we will discuss how number of 
retailers, holding cost, shipping cost, discount 
rate, and unit selling price of remanufactured 
products impact the switching point SI . 
Proposition 6: SI is convex decreasing in N, 
h, FS , VS  
 
SI decreases when the number of retailers N 
increases because the optimal profit of 
outsourcing strategy *Opi  is unchanged and the 
optimal profit of in-house strategy *Ipi  
decreases as N increases. Thus, SI shift to the 
left. The effect of holding cost h, fixed shipping 
cost FS , and variable shipping cost VS  on 
SI is similar to that of number of retailers N. 
Proposition 7: SI is convex decreasing in β . 
Proposition 8: SI is convex decreasing in P. 
From Propositions 2 and 3, we show that 
managers in fast-clockspeed industries tend to 
use smaller batch sizes and assign higher return 
priorities for products with higher prices and 
larger discount rates.  In Propositions 7 and 8 
we find that managers in these industries tend 
to switch to an outsourcing strategy when the 
number of products offered is smaller for 
products with higher prices and larger discount 
rates. 
Our research findings have several 
managerial implications.  First, past literature 
has shown that product variety will reduce 
profits, mainly due to changeover costs.  We 
show that, in the reverse supply chain, even 
without implicit changeover costs, product
