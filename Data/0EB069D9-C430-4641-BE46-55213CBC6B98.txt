英文摘要 
 Based on the 2nd-year’s controller design (a vision-based 
human-in-the-loop automatic car-following and intelligent cruise control 
switching system, and a TS-fuzzy-based integrated longitudinal and lateral 
coupled automatic lane-change controller system), in this year we finish: (1)

collision-avoidance maneuvers to achieve safety steering in traffic jam. The 
designed fuzzy controller system is to mimic human-driver behavior, and concern 
with human behavior and vehicle mechanism to achieve integrated brake and 
throttle operation. The proposed system has been implemented in Taiwan iTS-1 
for real road test. (2) Collusion warning/avoidance maneuver. (3) Fuzzy

 the human driver which can be viewed as a disturbance to the automation system. It is 
essential to consider the adequate stability and robustness into the controlling design. 
Moreover, drivers’ comfort is also the most important initiative counted for 
automation design. Coupling phenomena becomes more and more significant while 
driving at a higher acceleration but keeping in a safety vehicle-spacing. 
Sliding-mode-control and dynamic-surface-control methods were used to deal with 
nonlinearity and complicated coupling-effect. Many research methods were based on 
Lyapunov-based nonlinear control technologies. Recently, some researchers 
developed coordinated longitudinal- and lateral-control technologies to deal with 
nonlinearity and coupling-effect such that a vehicle system can drive safely in  
various  driving environment. 
 Based on the 2nd year’s research, we propose (1) a vision-based ACC+stop&go 
control system. This system provides collision-avoidance maneuvers to achieve safety 
steering in traffic jam. The designed fuzzy controller system is to mimic human-driver 
behavior, and concern with human behavior and vehicle mechanism to achieve 
integrated brake and throttle operation. The proposed system has been implemented in 
Taiwan iTS-1 for real road test. (2) Collusion warning/avoidance maneuver. (3) Fuzzy 
estimator to solve error signals and sensor failure for 2nd year’s lane-change control 
system. We demonstrate this system via CarSim overtake environment.

As shown in Fig. 1, the longitudinal automation system is developed in a dual-loop 
structure. The adaptive horizontal detection area (HAD) deals with the data from the 
on-board sensors according to the SW angle and vehicle dynamics. Instead of 
horizontal detection in a fixed pattern, the adaptive detection area performs the 
adaptive action in order to guarantee that the preceding vehicle is detected on both

1.1. Supervisory Control 
In the stop-and-go mode, the subject-vehicle has to keep spacing from the 
preceding-vehicle with a quicker response than that of ACC mode. We choose the 
following sliding surface defined on the error and error-variation as

&S G R R desS e e Rλ= + +                        (4-45) 
The stability of the sliding surface in (4-45) is examined by setting SS&G =0, and the 
error dynamics is eR(t) =e-λT − /desR λ . Thus, SS&G is stable but not asymptotically since 
( ) ( ) /R dese t R t λ→   as t → ∞ which is bounded and can be reduced by choosing larger 
positive value of λ. Moreover, for steady-state car-following, the subject-vehicle 
maintains a constant speed or stops as the same as the preceding-vehicle such that 
; the spacing error will approach zero, that is, e0des fR aσ= = R → 0. We then choose 
the control law as 
& &S G S G S GS K S= − &                         (4-46) 
where KS&G > 0 is to guarantee the desired condition and asymptotic stability.  
By virtue of (4-45) and (4-46), the desired acceleration is derived as

Figure 4 shows the overall structure of the regulation control. To test the performance 
of our PD-based FLC, we consider the constant velocity-tracking case. We find that 
there always exists a steady-state error (around 2.5 km/h) for the desired 
velocity-tracking (80 km/h), as shown in Fig. 5(a). This is possibly due to the grad of 
uphill-road and the friction between vehicle’s rubber-tires and asphalt roads. 
Therefore, we add an integral controller with limited saturation [1, -1] to compensate 
error. Figure 5(b) shows the improved performance of the proposed PID-based FLC.

2. Collision Warning/Avoidance Maneuver 
 
Fig. 10.  Headway distance for car-following. 
 
There are two stages in the CW/CA strategy. The first stage is the computation of 
warning distance for the normal warning situation. The second stage is the 
computation of braking distance for the guarantee of collision avoidance. It is possible 
for a driver to begin a driving collision avoidance maneuver earlier than a braking 
collision avoidance maneuver. Therefore, the CW/CA strategy should employ a 
non-conservative warning distance before that the driver begins the steering maneuver, 
and a conservative braking distance that if less than this distance, then the emergency 
steering maneuvers is started. 
  In Fig. 10, the dynamics of car-following is illustrated. Initially the headway 
distance between the preceding vehicle and the following vehicle is dr . The preceding 
vehicle starts to brake with the deceleration ap and its traveling distance to stop is Vp 
2/2ap. After the reaction time Tc of the driver and the brake actuator of the following 
vehicle, the traveling distance to stop with the deceleration af is Vf Tc + Vf2/2af . 
Therefore, the anti-collision distance can be obtained as

  With the increased driving velocity, TTC=2 s corresponds to less order of the 
warning evaluate signal. The order 0.4 which represents TTC=2 s at the high velocity 
35 m/s (=126 km/h) is then chosen as the indication from normal situation to critical 
situation. In order to characterize different warning levels, three zones in Fig. 4-14 are 
defined as  
- Green zone: IW > 1: the current inter-distance d is larger than the warning distance 
dw . This is safe range for car-following operation.  
- Yellow zone: 0.4 < IW ≤ 1: the current inter-distance dr is smaller than dw . This range 
indicates the driver that the following distance is not safe and the vehicle should be 
decelerated. 
- Red zone: IW ≤ 0.4: the current inter-distance dr reaches the braking distance dbr . In 
this range, the braking should be immediately applied to avoid collision with the 
preceding vehicle. 
 
3.Fuzzy Estimator 
 
 The fuzzy control design introduced above requires all states feedback in each local 
linear controller. In practice, all states of the system can not be directly measured, 
lateral velocity and yaw error especially, such that a fuzzy estimator is developed to 
estimator states of T-S vehicle fuzzy model：

  In this section, simulation results of our proposed TS-fuzzy driving controller under 
a standard double-lane-change (DLC) maneuver are presented. The software used 
here is CarSim, a general software to simulate the dynamic behavior of a road vehicle 
and provide the interface programmed by Matlab/Simulink and animation [28]. The 
nominal values of vehicle parameters which are required in simulation are given as 
Table A.3 in Appendix A. Two remarkable examples are compared with our control 
algorithm to highlight the feature of our approach.  
 
Comparison 1: In Autopia program, fuzzy logic control is used to design the steering 
control and the speed control separately [10-12]. As shown in Fig. 13, the left vehicle 
is controlled by using Autopia approach, while the right vehicle is controlled by our 
controller. The control objective is to follow the desired lateral offset trajectory (to 
vehicle’s CG, ds = 0 m) of DLC and maintain a reference velocity of 90 km/h. Figures 
14(a) and 14(b) depict the two vehicles’ lateral offset and reference velocity response, 
respectively. The Autopia approach fails to track the desired lateral offset trajectory, 
and its velocity response varies more promptly than our proposed controller. It can be 
concluded that even though fuzzy control is applied in vehicle speed and steering 
controller, the coupling effect still can not be handled due to the separation design of

Table 3 summarizes the DLC performance for the proposed TS-fuzzy automated 
driving controller with preview distances [0, 5, 10] m. The maximum and average 
errors of distance between C.G. of the vehicle from the road centerline are denoted as 
|ey_max| and |ey_ave|, respectively. The maximum and average errors of velocity between 
the referenced and the measured vehicle velocity are denoted as |evx_max| and |evx_ave|, 
respectively. The vehicle velocity is at 90 km/h. It can be seen that the longer preview 
distance improves the tracking accuracy of lateral offset trajectory but does nothing to 
velocity tracking performance. Consequently, the value 10 m for the preview distance 
is adequate to be implemented by the vision system.
