3. Numerical Simulation 
3.1. Numerical simulation 
In this research, numerical simulation is 
performed based on the Lennard-Jones potential 
with the Derjaguin approximation. 
The pressure between two macroscopic bodies 
can be obtained by integrating the Lennard-Jones 
potential over two bodies.  Thus, the pressure 
)(hp  between two infinite surfaces is [8, 9]

the lines of the two-dimensional Maugis model are 
slightly different from those of numerical 
simulations.  For =λ 0.1, the discrepancy is large. 
 Figure 8 shows the contact half-widths ( NA  
and B ) vs. the Maugis parameters for 0=W  and 
for pull-off load.  NA 's are similar to B 's for 
Maugis parameter ≥λ 0.4.  As the Maugis 
parameter becomes smaller, the discrepancy 
becomes larger.  But they have the same trends. 
 
5. Discussion 
 For small Maugis parameter, two-dimensional 
Maugis can predict neither the pull-off forces nor the 
contact half-widths well.  We will discuss it. 
 
5.1 Two-Dimensional DMT Model 
 For the adhesive contact between spheres, the 
DMT model can apply to small, stiff spheres, whose 
Maugis parameter λ  approaches 0.  The original 
DMT model did not result in an analytic solution.  
Maugis [6] proposed an approximation for the DMT 
model by taking the adhesion equal to γpiR2 .  
Therefore, the DMT model is the Hertz-plus-offset 
model [23].  As the Maugis parameter approaches 
0, the Maugis model approaches the DMT model. 
 It is similar for two-dimensional Maugis model.  
The two-dimensional DMT model is also the 
Hertz-plus-offset model.  In the two-dimensional 
Maugis model, as 0→λ , the pull-off force is [13] 
2/122 λ=T        (14) 
For the two-dimensional DMT model, the relation 
between total load and contact half-width

The two-dimensional Maugis model approaches the 
two-dimensional DMT model as 0→λ .  In figure 
7, the line of the two-dimensional DMT model and 
that of the Maugis model for =λ 0.1, nearly 
coincide. 
In Figure 1, as 0→λ , the two-dimensional 
Maugis model approaches the two-dimensional 
DMT model.  This model is not a rigid cylinder 
model as Johnson and Greenwood claimed [13]. 
 
5.2 Two-Dimensional Rigid Model 
 If both the cylinder and the half space are rigid, 
it may be called "two-dimensional rigid model".  
Based on the Lennard-Jones potential, given a 
non-dimensional approach distance ∆ , the 
non-dimensional load is (see Appendix A)

The contact half-width vs. load of two-dimensional 
rigid model can be obtained from equations (16) and 
(17).  Figure 7 shows the contact half-width vs. 
load of two-dimensional rigid model for =λ 0.1.  
As the contact half-width is small, the 
contact-half-width-load curve follows the rigid 
model.  As the contact half-width is large, the curve 
does not follow the Maugis model.  This 
phenomenon could possibly be explained by 
Greenwood’s semi-rigid model [10] or Wu's 
modified Hertzian contact model [23]. 
 In the two-dimensional rigid model, the pull-off 
force occurs at

In three-dimensional rigid model, the minimum w  
occurs at 0=δ  [9].  But in two-dimensional rigid 
model, the minimum w  does not occur at 0=δ . 
 Similar to the adhesive contact between spheres, 
for the adhesive contact between a cylinder and a 
half-space, the Maugis parameter governs the 
transition from the two-dimensional JKR model to 
the two-dimensional rigid model.  A good curve fit 
between the limiting values is
