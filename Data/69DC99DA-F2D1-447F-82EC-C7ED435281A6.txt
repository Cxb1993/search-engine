Cancer is a genetic disease, mostly 
resulting from acquired mutations and epigenetic 
changes that influence gene expression. 
Accordingly, a major focus in cancer research is 
identifying genetic markers that can be used for 
precise diagnosis or treatment. Over the last half-
century, investigators have used reductionism to 
discover such markers through the study of 
simple genetic changes like balanced 
chromosomal translocations. For example, 
fundamental insights into the nature of the bcr-
abl gene translocation product resulted in the 
precise molecular classification of chronic 
myelogenous leukemia and recently led to the 
development of the molecularly targeted tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor STI571 for the treatment of this 
disease. Ninety percent of human cancers, 
however, are epithelial in origin and display 
marked aneuploidy, multiple gene amplifications 
and deletions, and genetic instability, making 
resulting downstream effects difficult to study 
with traditional methods. Because this 
complexity probably explains the clinical 
diversity of histological similar tumors, a 
comprehensive understanding of the genetic 
alterations present in all tumors is required. 
Advances in molecular classification of tumors 
may play a central role in cancer treatment. Here, 
a novel approach to genome expression pattern 
interpretation is proposed. Using cDNA 
microarrays data generated by a previous study, 
an intelligent system is able to identify normal 
and diffuse large ovarian cancer patients. 
The systematic classification of types of 
tumours is crucial to achieve advances in cancer 
treatment and research. The specification of 
therapies according to tumour types 
differentiated by pathogenetic patterns may 
maximize the efficacy of the treatment and 
minimize toxicity on the patients. Several 
limitations about the conventional classification 
techniques based on morphological features of 
the tumour have been reported in the literature 
[1]. Moreover, by analyzing complex patterns 
defined by molecular markers, it has been 
demonstrated that there are subtypes of acute 
leukaemia, prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas [2-3]. Thus, there are two useful 
tasks in cancer classification: prediction of 
classes and discovery of classes. The prediction 
task consists of the assignment of particular 
tumour samples to known types of cancer, and 
the discovery task refers to the identification of 
unrecognized subtypes. In order to achieve a 
better insight into the problem of cancer 
classification, systematic approaches based on 
global gene expression analysis have been 
proposed [1, 3]. 
The most important points in building a 
classifier are these: 
。Collect as many examples as possible and 
divide them into a training set and a test set 
。Use as simple a classification method as 
possible with as few adjustable parameters 
as possible. Advance approaches (neural 
networks and support vector machines) 
require more examples for training than 
nearest-neighbor methods. 
。Test the performance of your classifier on 
the independent test set.

B. Multiclass classification with fuzzy 
nearest prototype classification and 
ARLA  
Nearest prototype classification (NPC) has 
been motivated in the literature in two ways. 
One motivation comes from Bayesian decision 
theory, which is a fundamental approach to 
classification problems. Construction of the 
classifier involves two steps: 1) the construction 
of models for the probability densities of the 
different classes and 2) the construction of the 
classification boundaries using the criterion of 
maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability. If, for 
example, probability densities are well 
approximated by Gaussian mixtures and if all 
components are assumed to be of equal strength 
and variance, the MAP classifier reduces to a 
NPC based on Euclidean distances between the 
data points and the centers of the components. 
Approaches of this kind can work well but have 
to cope with the disadvantage that a more 
difficult problem (estimation of probability 
densities) has to be solved than necessary 
(estimation of the classification boundary) and 
more training data are needed. 
In order to improve classification 
performance, cost-functions have been proposed 
for model selection. First a family of 
parameterized discriminator functions was 
constructed and then a measure of performance 
was defined which is related (but not equal) to 
the rate of misclassification leading to an 
individual loss for every data point. Model 
selection is performed by stochastic gradient 
descent on the total loss over the training set. A 
continuous loss function was used in order to 
apply gradient-based optimization and several 
hyperparameters were introduced for this 
purpose. 
An NPC consists of a set of 
labeled prototype vectors. The prototype vectors 
 are vectors in data space, and 
the  are their corresponding 
class labels. The class of a new data point x is 
determined:
