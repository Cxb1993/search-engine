二、 緣由與目的 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Vehicle safety is a very important issue, but 
people did not pay much attention on it in early days. 
The statistics of the injuries and fatalities in traffic 
accidents become more serious year by year. Therefore, 
someone began to notice the relevant problems of 
motor vehicle safety and make more studies and 
solution to this issue, for example, adaptive cruise 
control (ACC) [1], antilock brake system (ABS)[2][3], 
collision warning system (CWS), event data recorder 
(EDR) [4], on-board diagnostics (OBD) [5], and 
emergency automatic brake (EAB), etc. Generally 
speaking, the causes of the traffic crash can be 
categorized into three parts, "people", "vehicle" and 
"environment" [6]. In United States, National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also points 
out that there are about 80% - 90% traffic crashes 
caused by the "people" factor [7]. In this study, a 
vehicular collision avoidance system (CAS), including 
collision warning system (CWS) and motor vehicle 
event data record (MVEDR) [8], is developed to 
perform a pre-crash warning and implement an 
effective event data recording. 
A built-in distributed platform with 
DaVinci+XScale-NAV270 is responsible for 
processing and analyzing all of data sent by vision 
sensors and equipments from the outside of motor 
vehicle. In this study, the vision-based sensor has been 
applied to capture image to further find out the angle, 
velocity, and distance between the host and other 
vehicle and GPS provides latitude, longitude, and 
altitude to estimate the relative acceleration, velocity, 
and distance between the host and other vehicle. 
Further If there is a crossing coming from two 
prolonged tracks ahead of vehicle, early warning alters 
driver immediately. Moreove, in-vehicle hazardous 
driving, which is attributed to three factors: fatigue 
level (FL), carbon monoxide concentration (COC), and 
breath alcohol concentration (BAC), has also 
considered. This characteristic of involving drowsiness 
out of the factors just mentioned is detected [9] and 
evolved through a quantum-tuned back-propagation 
neural network (QT-BPNN) to generate the extra 
reaction time that is treated as part of driver reaction 
time. In order to improve the collision prediction, the 
accurate collision warning level has been issued 
through an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference 
System (ANFIS) [10]. CWS is implemented in 
conjunction with MVEDR so as for attaining more 
driving safety and preventing traffic accident. 
 
2. Collision warning system (CWS) 
 
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, an embedded 
system built in the distributed platform with 
DaVinci+XScale-NAV270 [11] is served as a digital 
automobile console (DAC) where a collision warning 
system, as described in the following session and 
shown in Figure 3, is in conjunction with a motor 
vehicle event data record (MVEDR) as shown in 
Figure 4. In Figure 5 all equipments have been set up 
in a motor vehicle for collision warning system in this 
study. A collision warning system has been involved in 
three stages: sensor stage, data fusion (prediction) 
stage, and warning stage. 
 
2.1. Sensor stage 
 
The visual images are captured fast by several 
CCD cameras and then sent to the platform DaVinci at 
the rate of 30 frames per second for each camera. 
Visual image analysis will execute both lane marking 
and vehicle detections [12] [13] respectively in each 
image as shown in Figures 6 to 9 and then give the 
relevant data like distance, velocity, and angle between 
the host and other vehicles by using Goldbeck 
algorithm [12] [13] to acquire the necessary data which 
are needed to transmit to the second platform XScale-
NAV270 via fast Ethernet interface.  
Vehicle state sensors detect all kinds of data such 
as vehicle velocity, tire pressure and engine 
temperature, etc. In-vehicle CCD camera is applied to 
detecting the fatigue of vehicle driver, CO detector is 
employed to detect the content of carbon monoxide in 
vehicle, and BA detector is utilized to detect the 
concentration of breath alcohol for driver. Then these 
sensor data will transmit to a CAN manager via CAN 
Bus [14] such that one is to record the necessitated 
information into MVEDR and another is to send a 
couple of sensed data (such as FL, COC, and BAC) 
received from three detectors to evaluate the extra 
reaction time for driver. 
On-board global positioning system (GPS) can 
supply the necessary localization information like 
latitude, longitude, and altitude for vehicles and those 
of data have been transmitted to neighbor’s vehicles 
 4
lanes when the driver prepares to change lanes as 
shown in Figure 12 (c). 
 Head-On Collision Warning (HOCW): 
A head-on collision as shown in Figure 12 (d) is the 
one where the front ends of two vehicles hit each other, 
as opposed to a side-collision or rear-end collision. 
Head-on collision warning system with 4 warning 
levels prompts drivers a possible crash danger with 
oncoming vehicle in front where both cars drive in the 
same roadway and yet move on the opposite direction. 
 
3. BPNN predicting extra reaction time. 
 
A well-known intelligent computing machine, 
three-layer back-propagation neural net (BPNN) [20] 
as shown in Figure 13, is used to predict the extra 
reaction time as part of driver reaction time for 
properly extending collision warning distance 
according to three factors of in-vehicle hazardous 
driving - FL, COC, and BAC. By crossing examination 
among the performance criteria of the forecast outputs 
in the experimental results section, the prior validation 
(prediction) has showed that the forecasts are 
acceptable from the accuracy point of view.  
For this three-layer BPNN, a structure of 3×8×1 
multilayer-perceptron is used that the input layer has 3 
input neurons to catch the input patterns, the hidden 
layer has 8 neurons to propagate the intermediate 
signals, and the output layer has 1 neuron to display 
the computed results (extra reaction time). We arrange 
the input pattern in the following: a normalized fatigue 
level fatiguei
~ , a normalized carbon monoxide 
concentration coci
~ , and a normalized breath alcohol 
concentration baci
~ .The appropriate time, called the 
extra reaction time for driver ertτ , applied to collision 
warning system is designed as BPNN’s output. For 
more training assignments in this three-layer BPNN, 
the log-sigmoid transfer function is applied as the 
activations in the hidden layer and the pure-line 
transfer function is employed to the output layer as the 
activations. Bayesian regulation, involved Levenberg-
Marquardt training method, is set as the learning 
algorithm for this three-layer BPNN, where the 
performance function given below has been 
particularly optimized to its parameters, MSWγ and MSEγ , 
by quantum minimization as described in the next 
section.

Once in-vehicle hazardous driving attributed to 
three factors (FL, COC, and BAC) has been taken into 
account, we rewrite the formula of warning distance

This is a modified warning distance proposed in this 
study to evaluate the proper warning distance by

4. Quantum minimization 
 
Quantum minimization that makes optimization 
task work out associated with probability of success at 
least 1/2 within an unsorted database is realized by 
quantum minimum searching algorithm [21]. A 
quantum exponential searching algorithm [22] is called 
by quantum minimum searching algorithm to be as a 
subroutine to serve a fast database searching engine.

We assume in this section that the number t of 
solutions is known and that it is not zero. Let

Embedded Hybrid Intelligent Prediction (EHIP) we 
proposed in this paper. As a result, the proposed one 
outperforms two remarkable systems due to fast 
detection for pre-crash warning.

6. Concluding remarks 
 
A high-performance collision warning system 
(CWS) based on vision sensing has been implemented 
by an embedded data fusion system built in a 
distributed platform DaVinci+XScale-NAV270. This 
is developed for collision warning system (CWS) and 
motor vehicle event data recorder (MVEDR). A hybrid 
intelligent prediction using embedded data fusion 
system QT-BPNN/ANFIS was employed to realize 
CWS and further in-vehicle drowsiness attributed to 
FL, COC, and BAC have also token into consideration 
in CWS. A couple of experiments have been validated 
and verified successfully in this study. We drew the 
conclusion that the proposed approach achieves fast 
crash detection, accurate warning prediction, and 
effective event data recording.
