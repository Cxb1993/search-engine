Abstract 
    In this study, the relationship between the grain-boundary composition and varistor 
properties were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy 
(XPS). It was found that the CaCu3Ti4O12 sample did not exhibit varistor behavior when the 
compositions of grain boundary and grain were nearly the same before discontinuous grain 
growth. The CaCu3Ti4O12 sample exhibited varistor behavior after the occurrence of 
discontinuous grain growth. After discontinuous grain growth, Cu-rich secondary phase appeared 
at the grain-boundaries. The XPS results reveal that Cu+ is the major content of the second phases. 
The formation of negatively charged species, 'CuV , 
'
2++CuCu or ''CuV , existing at the grain 
boundaries due to the oxidation of the secondary phase during cooling after sintering can act as 
acceptors, forming double Schottky barriers with the n-type semiconductor grains.

Introduction 
CaCu3Ti4O12(CCTO) shows large dielectric constant1 and also exhibits varistor behavior. 
Chung et al. used scanning Kelvin probe microscopy to prove that the varistor behavior in CCTO 
with ZrO2 balls for 12 hours. The mixed powders were calcined for 2 hours at 960℃ in air after 
drying. X-ray diffraction identified a single phase for the powders after calcination. After 
calcination, the powders were milled again for 12 hours. The powders were then uniaxially 
pressed at 75MPa into disks. The disks were pressed again using cold isostatic pressing with a 
pressure of 150MPa. The greens (10mm in diameter and 2mm in thickness) were sintered at 
1065℃ in air for 1 or 20 hours, then furnace cooled to room temperature. The relative bulk 
density of the specimen was 87% and 90% which was sintered for one (CCTO1) and twenty 
(CCTO20) hours. In-Ga electrodes were rubbed on the samples surfaces for electrical conduction 
analyses. Dielectric constants were measured using a Hewlett-Packard 4284A precision LCR 
meter over the frequency range from 20Hz to 1MHz and an oscillation voltage of 1V. The 
specimen I-V curves were measured using a Keithley 2410 Source meter. We obtained the 
electrical field logarithmic diagram versus current density after I-V curve calculation. Scanning 
electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) was employed to observe the specimen 
microstructure and grain size. A field emission transmission electron microscope (FEI, Tecnai G2 
F20) equipped with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector was used for Z-contrast (Z: 
atomic number) images. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to compare the grain 
and grain boundary compositions. A CCTO20 specimen was polished using SiC abrasive paper to 
obtain a polished surface. Another CCTO20 specimen was rapped using a hammer to obtain a 
fracture surface. The polished (PS) and fracture specimens (CS) were cleaned in acetone. The CS 
grain boundaries remained on the surface because of the relatively weak linkage between grains. 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (ESCA PHI 1600, Physical. Electronics, USA) 
measurements were performed on both PS and CS with Mg - Kα (1253.5eV) radiation. The 
sample charge produced by irradiation was determined by measuring the shift in the C 1s signal 
given by a binding energy of 284.5eV. The XPS results were simulated using XPSPEAK41. 
 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows the E-J characteristics of CCTO1 and CCTO20. The shape of the CCTO1 
and CCTO20 curves are different, as shown in figure 1. When the current density reached 
stoichiometric CaCu3Ti4O12 were reported in the literature.10,14 TEM observation for CCTO20 
indicates that Cu-rich secondary phases are mainly located at the grain-boundaries. The XPS 
results reveal that Cu+ is the major content of the second phases. CuO will be more stable than 
Cu2O in air at room temperature during cooling15. This results in the transformation of some 
Cu2O into Cu2-xO, CuO or Cu1-xO at the grain-boundaries. The negatively charged species, 'CuV , 
'
2++CuCu or ''CuV , existing at the grain boundaries can act as acceptors, forming double Schottky 
barriers with the n-type semiconductor grains. 
 
Conclusions 
In conclusion, the CCTO specimen does not exhibit varistor behavior without Cu-rich 
secondary phases located at the grain-boundaries. The CaCu3Ti4O12 sample exhibited varistor 
behavior after the occurrence of discontinuous grain growth. After discontinuous grain growth, 
Cu-rich secondary phase appeared at the grain-boundaries. The copper defects in the Cu-rich 
secondary phase existing at the grain-boundaries are suggested to play an important role in 
developing the Schottky barrier and the CCTO varistor mechanism.
