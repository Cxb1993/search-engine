structure of one typical microdisk is
demonstrated in Fig. 1 using a SEM micrograph.
3. Measurement results and discussions
The optical properties of microdisks were
characterized by optical pumping through a μ-PL
setup [8]. We focused a 532 nm solid state laser
by a microscope objective to the microdisks and
the luminescence was collected by the same
objective. The collected light is spectrally
analyzed by a monochromator followed by a
cooled charge coupled device (CCD) detector
array for low temperature measurements. For
room temperature (RT) measurements, we use an
InGaAs detector instead of CCD array due to the
wavelength limitation of the latter.
From the measurements, we observed
whispering gallery modes (WGM) at 77 K from
microdisks of radius 5 m and of radius 2 m,
together with a relatively slow variation in Fig.
2(a) with the mode spacing corresponding to the
resonance of radial modes. In order to remove
the radial resonance, we designed the holey
microdisk pattern by e-beam lithography with a
1-μm-diameter small hole placed at the center.
The hole must be suitably designed to eliminate
the radial resonance but not to destroy the
pedestal during the wet etching process. The RT
PL spectrum shown in Fig. 2(b) indicates the
successful suppression of the radial resonance by
this design. No WGMs were observed in RT
measurements probably due to the stronger
surface recombination at the periphery of the
disk at RT.
The lasing behavior was demonstrated by
the measurement of output light intensity as a
function of pumping power. Fig. 3(a) shows the
relationship between the strongest WGM
intensity and the pumping power, which clearly
illustrates a lasing behavior. The lasing threshold
was estimated by the optical coupling efficiency
of our system, the Gaussian profile of the

44. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully
fabricated QD microdisks and observed radial
modes and WGMs inside the disk structure by
μ-PL measurements. The radial modes can be
largely suppressed by introducing a
1-μm-diameter hole at the center of a
10-μm-diameter microdisk cavity. Microdisks
with such a design can be applied to the
suppression of the radial mode resonances and
provide a clear WGM modal spectra in the
microdisk cavities. The lasing behavior of the
WGMs are observed at 77K and the quality
factor of the microdisk cavities is larger than
14000.

Microdisks embedded with quantum-dot (QD) active medium are fabricated in this work using the
e-beam lithography and dry-etching technologies in order to study the light emission properties under
the influences of cavity modes. These new kinds of microdisks, combining the small mode volume and
the delta-function-like electron density of states of QDs, offer the potential to realize ultralow threshold
semiconductor lasers [1-4]. Our samples are composed of five layers of QDs and AlGaAs as cladding
layers on GaAs substrate. QD ground-state luminescence is about 1060 nm at room temperature.
Optical properties of microdisks were investigated by optical pumping through a
micro-photoluminescence setup. The whispering gallery modes (WGM) were observed at 77 K from
microdisks of radius 5m and of radius 2m. The lasing behaviors were confirmed by the
measurement of output light intensity as a function of pumping power. Furthermore, the WGM
linewidth also reduces with increasing pumping power [3].
In the analysis of resonant modes, we assume that the lowest order TE modes are dominant. From
the guided transverse mode profile, the effective index of refraction is calculated to describe the
resonant modes inside a cylindrical cavity [5]. The calculated average mode spacings of the lowest two
radial modes with different azimuthal numbers are 4.4 and 11 nm for microdisks of radius 5m and 2
m, respectively. The observed average separations of major peaks agree well with the calculated
values.
The measured minimum FWHM of WGM is 70 pm and is obtained from a microdisk of radius 5
m. The measured linewidth is limited by the resolution of our experimental setup. Therefore, the best
Q value of our microdisk resonators is larger than 14000.
