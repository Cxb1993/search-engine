most of them when the constant offset term is included.  
 
2. Methods 
Twelve archers from the man archery team of National College of Physical Education and Sports 
attended this experiment. In our experimental setting, a laser pen is mounted at the bow handle for 
capturing the aiming trajectory by using a digital video camera. Using the laser pen and the digital 
camera, both the vertical and horizontal aiming trajectory coordinates during a suitable period before 
releasing the arrow can be accurately recorded. On the other hand, the vertical and horizontal shot 
coordinates are captured by another camera placed in front of the target. These recorded data are then 
processed by APAS (Ariel Performance Analysis System) motion analysis system for studying the 
aiming procedure and the shot points along the vertical and the horizontal directions. The frequency of 
the digital video camera is set as 60 fields/second for capturing the light point trajectory, so in the fix 
field mode 90 fields will be recorded during the one and half second before release of the arrow.  
 
2.1. Field setup 
The distance between start line and arrow target is 70 meters. The experiment proceeds according to 
the usual competition procedure. Before the test, they can shoot three arrows to adjust their bow sight. 
Then the test begins. Each one of them shoots thirty six arrows, that is, 3 arrows will be shot for a 
round and totally 12 rounds are performed. Each arrow is required to be released within 40 seconds, 
otherwise it is not recorded.

where )(kx and )(ky are the time series of the horizontal and vertical deviations of the aiming 
trajectory; 1xa , 2xa , 1ya and 2ya are the corresponding coefficients of the AR2 model; )(ke are the 
white noise with zero mean.  
In order to estimate the coefficients of 1xa , 2xa , 1ya and 2ya , we form the following vectors and

By applying the similar technique as the above, the associated estimation errors with the offset are also 
calculated and listed in Table 2. Additionally, the estimated constant terms xb and yb are also shown 
in Table 3.  
As compared the fitting errors between Tables 1 and 2, the fitting errors by taking the offset into 
account are better than those without considering the offset, and this result is as expected due to the 
additional term for data fitting. By considering the fitting error of both the vertical and horizontal
