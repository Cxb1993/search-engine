23. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The green tea powder solution was prepared by
dissolving the tea powders in deionized water, and then
filtrating it through a PTFE membrane (45 mm, 45 μm,
Millipore Miller-HV, Ireland) to get the filtrate. Averaging
the HPLC results of several batches of the green tea
powders, the purity of the four catechins was about 16.0
wt% with the order of purity being EGCG (~7.9 wt%) >
EGC (~3.9 wt%) > ECG and EC (~2.2 wt% each), and the
purity of caffeine was about 5.0 wt%.
In the first stage, the effects of temperature, time,
pH, and water-oil ratio (ml/ml) of extraction were
investigated. First, the extraction temperature of 30℃
and time of 2 hr were optimally chosen (data not shown).
The effects of pH and water-oil ratio (ml/ml) were then
investigated and the results are shown in Table 1. It can
be seen that the purity and yield of tea catechins
decreased significantly with increasing the pH, but
increased only slightly with decreasing the pH, from the
original tea powder solution. For the sake of easy
operation, the solution without any pH adjustment was
chosen. It is also shown that increasing the water-oil ratio
from 1:1 to 1:2 only slightly increased the purity and
yield of tea catechins. For the sake of solvent saving, the
water-oil ratio of 1:1 was chosen.
The extraction process under the above optimal
operating conditions was further scaled up to increase the
extraction productivity. The scale-up was done by
increasing the concentration of tea powder solution from
10 mg/mL to 50 mg/mL and their extraction performances
were compared as shown in Table 2. It is found that the
liquid-liquid extraction was successfully scaled-up. In
summary, the extraction performances of the ethyl acetate
layers of several batches show that the purity of tea
catechins ranged from 55 to 65%, the concentration ratio
ranged from 3.5 to 4.5, and the yield of tea catechins
ranged from 65 to 75%.
In the second stage, the concentrated tea solution
used was prepared by drying the oil phase solution obtain
from the first stage, and then dissolving the concentrate in
deionized water. Figure 3 shows the corresponding
chromatogram of one example of the concentrated tea
solution. Averaging the HPLC results of several batches
of the concentrates, the purity of the four catechins was
about 56% with the order of purity being EGCG (~31%)
> ECG (~11%) > EGC and EC (~7% each), and the purity
of caffeine was about 9.5 %.
The effects of elution mode and mobile phase
composition on the separation efficiency were
investigated by injecting small amount (20 μL) of
component standards and the results are shown in Figure
4. Three different mobile phase compositions in the
isocratic mode, i.e. methanol/water (1% acetic acid) (v/v)
= 30:70, 25:75 and 20:80, were examined as shown in
Figure 4(a)-(c). In order to improve the separation
efficiency, the isocratic elution was referred to arrange the
step-gradient elution as follows: methanol/water (1%
acetic acid) (v/v) =20:80, 0~40min; 20~70:80~30,
40~70min, and its result is shown in Figure 4(d).
The effects of injection volume and injection
concentration on the separation efficiency are shown in
Figures 5 and 6, respectively. It is noted that, under the
preparative operation, the column was overloaded,
leading to the band overlapping, and the separation
efficiency decreased with the increase in the injection
volume and injection concentration. Injection volume of 2
mL and injection concentration of 9 mg/mL were then
chosen. A three-region separation strategy was proposed
as follows: collecting EGC in the first region, EGCG, EC
and CA in the second region, and ECG in the third region.
Using the optimal operating conditions, the
chromatograms of five consecutive runs are shown in
Figure 7. It is noted that the reproducibility from the five
runs was fairly good which means the column was
effectively regenerated. Figure 8 shows the corresponding
chromatogram of the three collected fractions and their
performances are shown in Table 3. As can be seen from
Figure 8 and Table 3, EGC EGCG+EC and ECG were
efficiently separated and concentrated in the three
collected fractions, respectively. Their purities in the three
collected fractions were about 48%, 70% and 60%,
respectively. After five times injection (about 88.6 mg of
concentrate and 40.5 mg of tea catechins injected), the
product yields of EGC, EGCG+EC and ECG were about
5 mg, 28 mg and 8 mg, respectively, and the yield of the
four catechins were 80+%.
Since CA has a similar elution behavior as that of
EGCG+EC, it is hard to separate CA from EGCG+EC by
column chromatography. Other decaffeination procedure
prior to the chromatographic separation of tea catechins is
needed. Work along this direction is currently in progress.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In the first stage, the liquid-liquid extraction method
was proved to be an efficient and scalable isolation
technique. Using ethyl acetate as the extractant operated
under the optimal extraction conditions, the purity of the
four catechins was raised to be about 55 to 65%, the
concentration ratio ranged from 3.5 to 4.5, and the yield
of the four catechins was about 65 to 75%. In the second
stage, the four catechins can be effectively separated by
preparative elution chromatography under the reversed
phase mode. Using a preparative C-18 column operated
under the optimal elution conditions, EGC, EGCG+EC
and ECG were efficiently separated and collected in three
separated regions. Their purities in the three collected
fractions were about 48%, 70% and 60%, respectively,
and the yield of the four tea catechins were 80+%.
