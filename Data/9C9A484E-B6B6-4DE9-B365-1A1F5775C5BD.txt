Abstract- In this report, the problem of event-region detection in wire-
less sensor networks (WSNs) is explored. Sensor fusion techniques are
developed to tackle this problem. However, in contrast to the existing
sensor fusion rules in the literature, sensor nodes considered here could
observe different phenomena or events, and each node makes its decision
with respect to its own hypothesis. In particular, a space-memory fusion
rule that considers both space-memory information and local detection
performance is derived for event-region detection. In addition, the pro-
posed fusion rule performs in a sequential manner. The need of the fault-
tolerance capability for possible sensor faults is also integrated with the
design of the space-memory fusion rule. Specifically, the a priori sensor-
fault model is used in this report to address the issue of fault-tolerance
capability. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
fusion rule in the event-region detection.

二、 前言, 研究目的, 文獻探討
With an emerging need in environmental monitoring, research on event-
region detection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has received a great
amount of interest recently. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in this problem, sen-
sor networks are asked to determine where the event-regions are located
by analyzing distinguishable collected attributions of the monitored area.
One of the attractive features of a WSN is that nodes make local ob-
servations of the covered area and produce a global result that reflects the
2
vor of either of the hypotheses until the employed stopping rule stops
taking new observations. The problem formulation in this report differs
from the traditional sequential detection in that each node makes fused
decisions at each time step so that immediate decisions are available at
any time. The considered scenario is more suitable for the applications
of event-region detection, since, in these applications, the deployed nodes
may have to report their decisions in every time interval, enabling the
selection of appropriate strategies at the earliest or most time. Due to
possible sensor faults and transmission errors, fault-tolerance capability
is essential and is addressed in this report by integrating a priori fault
model in the detection scheme.
The advantages of our strategy is demonstrated through performance
comparison. We first design a sequential ICM (SICM) scheme, which is
modified from the ICM scheme used in (7). The results show that the pro-
posed approach achieves lower error probability as compared with SICM.
Additionally, the results demonstrate that, as compared with SICM and
the detection scheme without using the spatial information, the proposed
approach has much greater decreasing rate of the error probability as a
function of the time.
三、 問題敘述與解決方法
Problem statement For the problem of event-region detection, each
sensor node is designed to distinguish the null hypothesis H corresponding
to no event having occurred and the alternative hypothesis K correspond-
ing to the event having occurred at its location. The a priori probabilities
of both hypotheses are denoted by P (H) = PH and P (K) = PK, respec-
tively.
This report considers a sequential decision approach in a collaborative
manner as follows. At the beginning of time j, the local decision u
(j−1)
s
made by senor node ns at the previous time j − 1 is sent to all its neigh-
boring nodes {nt}t∈Vs , where the set Vs represents the neighbors of the
spatial location s. At the end of time j, sensor ns takes another obser-
vation y
(j)
s and performs a fusion process to produce an updated decision
u
(j)
s by combining its new measurement y
(j)
s and the received binary de-
cisions {uˇ(j−1)t,s }t∈Vs , where uˇ(j−1)t,s is the binary decision received at node
ns corresponding to the local decision u
(j−1)
t sent by neighbor nt. Due
to the randomness of channel noise and possible sensor faults, in gen-
eral, uˇ
(j−1)
t,s 6= u(j−1)t and uˇ(j−1)t,s 6= uˇ(j−1)t,r if r 6= s. Since the fusion takes
place at each local sensor ns, in the remainder of the report, we use uˇ
(j−1)
t
to denote uˇ
(j−1)
t,s without causing any confusion. Notably, at the initial
time step (j = 0), node ns makes a local decision u
(0)
s only based on its

Markov random fields In this report, the spatial interaction among
the hypotheses {Hs}s∈S is modeled by the MRF (8). An MRF model,
defined with respect to a neighborhood system V , has been proved to be
equivalent to the Gibbs field (8) whose potentials are associated with V .
We first describe the concept of a clique and a neighborhood system, since
the elementary relationships within the neighborhood V are established
through the system of cliques C. A set V = {Vs ⊆ S, s ∈ S} is a neigh-
borhood system for S if, for every spatial location s ∈ S, s /∈ Vs and
s ∈ Vr ⇐⇒ r ∈ Vs, where the elements of the set Vs are the neighboring
locations of the spatial location s. A set of locations C ⊆ S is a clique if,
for locations r, s ∈ C, r ∈ Vs. For any randomly or irregularly deployed
WSN in S, the neighborhood set Vs of s can be defined as comprising of
neighboring locations within the radius of
√
R as
Vs = {r ∈ S|[Dist(s, r)]2 ≤ R, r 6= s}, (2)
where Dist(s, r) is the distance between location s and location r (9). For
a Gibbs field,
PM(H = h) =
1
Z
exp (−E(h)), (3)
where E(h) is the energy of h, and Z =
∑
h∈{H,K}|S| exp(−E(h)) is a
normalizing factor. There are several ways of defining the energy function.
Here, we define it as (9)
E(h) =
∑
c∈C
Ec(h) =
∑
{r,s}∈C
βt(hr, hs) +
∑
{r}∈C
αhr , (4)
where t(hr, hs) = −1 if hr = hs, and t(hr, hs) = 1, otherwise.
The parameter β can be viewed as the spatial interaction coefficient in
S. In this report, we set β = 1. The parameter {αk} is a set of parameters
for single-node cliques. αk can be seen as a cost parameter for hypothesis
k ∈ {H,K}. In this report, we set αk = 0 for all performance evaluations.

space-memory fusion rule is to show that the decreasing rate of the error
probability can be improved substantially by exchanging decisions with
neighbors.
In this example, we consider a network consisting of 2601 nodes. With-
out loss of generality, we consider that the nodes are regularly distributed
in a 51 × 51 square grid of 51 × 51 units area. Fig. 2 shows a sample
scenario of the simulated event region. In the figure, if hypothesis H is
true at a sensor node, the node is represented by a circle “◦”. Otherwise,
the node is represented by a bullet “•”. The hypothesis configurations in
the simulated WSN are generated by setting β = 1 and using the Gibbs
sampler (9). The details of the Gibbs sampler are not discussed here. For
the purpose of simplicity, the radius of the neighborhood
√
R is set to be
1. Thus, the MRF model considered is a four-connectivity neighborhood,
and the computation of the energy function E ({ht}t∈Vs , hs) is reduced to
the number of nodes r ∈ Vs for which hr 6= hs minus the number of nodes
r ∈ Vs for which hr = hs.

Figure 2: A sample scenario of event-region detection for a simulated WSN
with 51× 51 nodes.
The signal strength γs was assumed to be 0 if H is true, and it was as-
sumed to be 1 if K is present. The sensor measurement noise was randomly
drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. We
set the sensor failure probabilities p1s = p0s = 0.02 for all ns. To evalu-
ate the performance of the three approaches quantitatively, we generated
1000 different scenarios of simulated event regions. Each scenario consists
of 2601 nodes as in Fig. 2. We calculated the average error probability
over these 1000 simulated scenarios. Fig. 3 plots the average error prob-
ability as functions of time j for SICM, SDWOC, and the space-memory
fusion approaches. From Fig. 3, we can see that the error probability
of the space-memory fusion decreases much faster than the other two ap-
proaches.

五、 計畫成果自評 In this report, we developed the space-memory fusion
rule for the applications of event-region detection in WSNs. Unlike the
Chair-Varshney fusion rule, the proposed fusion rule is to fuse the decisions
from the sensor nodes whose observations do not necessarily come from
a common phenomenon. This rule was designed by considering both the
spatial information and the local detection performance. Furthermore,
this fusion rule was derived in a sequential processing manner to achieve
energy efficiency. The fault-tolerance requirement was also incorporated
into the design of this fusion rule to suit the applications in WSNs. The
simulation results showed that the proposed space-memory fusion scheme
can provide significant better performance compared with both the SICM
and the SDWOC approaches, the other two sequential detectors.
