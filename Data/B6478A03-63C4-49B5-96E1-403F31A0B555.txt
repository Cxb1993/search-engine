Chapter 1 Introduction 
With the rapid development of wireless communication systems, the requirements for compact, low-cost, 
and low profile passive components are demanded in recent years.  To achieve these purposes, various 
efforts could be done in a single circuit module.  Integration of antenna and bandpass filter (BPF) in one 
module is one of the ways to achieve miniaturization and improved performance of microwave front ends.  
However, to date, there has been relatively little research conducted on an efficient integration between the 
filter and antenna with simple fabrication and good circuit behavior.  Hence, this dissertation mainly focuses 
on the designs of the compact filtering antennas with good frequency responses by using an efficient 
co-design method.  This chapter firstly describes the motivation of the research, and then briefly reviews 
surveyed literature.  The contributions of this dissertation are presented next.  The last section of this 
chapter is to provide an outline of the following chapters. 
Since the size reduction and low profile structure are a trend in the circuit design of a wireless 
communication systems, it is desired to integrate the bandpass filter and antenna in a single module, so called 
filtering antenna, with filtering and radiating functions simultaneously.  In traditional design, the filter and 
the antenna are designed individually, with the common ports’ characteristic impedance Z0, and then 
connected directly.  The direct connection of the filter and antenna usually causes an impedance mismatch, 
which may deteriorate the filter’s performance (especially near the band edges) and increase the insertion loss 
of the circuitry.  To avoid this, extra matching network should be implemented in between these two 
components [1]. 
Several investigations have been focused on adding the radiating or filtering function into an antenna or 
filter [2]-[4].  In [2], metal posts were inserted into a horn antenna, which can generate the filtering function.  
And in [3], the way is to create coupled cavities into a leaky wave antenna so as to generate filtering 
performance on the antenna.  Frequency selectivity surface using cascading substrate integrated waveguide 
cavity had been designed and directly installed at the aperture of horn antenna [4].  While these proposed 
circuits possess the characteristics of filtering and radiating, it should be noted that they were designed 
without using a systematic approach nor considering much on the filter’s or antenna’s specifications. 
Various approaches for integrating the filter and antenna into a single microwave device have been discussed 
in [5]-[10].  For size reduction, a pre-designed bandpass filter with suitable configuration was directly 
inserted into the feed position of a patch antenna [5] and a horn antenna [6].  By using an extra impedance 
transformation structure in between the filter and the antenna, the bandpass filter can be integrated properly 
with the antenna over the required bandwidth [7]-[9]. However, the transition structure needs additional 
circuit area, and the designs did not have good filter characteristics over the frequency range.  In [10], a 
mutual synthesis approach was proposed, which considered the conjugate impedance matching in between the 
filter and antenna. It seems that the matching was performed only at the center frequency, without considering 
the effect of the antenna’s bandwidth and quality factor.  Therefore, the main subject of this dissertation is to 
develop new filtering antennas without using any extra matching circuits or transitions via the co-design 
method.  For the purpose of size reduction and good filter response, several compact structures are presented 
and established in this research.

antenna.  
Since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has released the bandwidth 3.1–10.6 GHz [24], 
ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems attract great attention in the wireless world due to their 
advantages, including high speed data rate, low power consumption, high capacity, low cost, and low 
complexity.  These UWB systems for communications are especially applied to home networking systems as 
a technology of wireless personal area networks.  As a key component of UWB communication systems, 
UWB antennas with the fascinated features, such as wide bandwidth, simple structure, and omni-directional 
radiation pattern, have been widely investigated.   
Among the planar UWB antenna designs in the recent literature, the slot and monopole antenna are 
mainly focused.  The advantages of slot antennas include wide bandwidth performance and low cost in the 
printed circuit board (PCB) process [25]-[27].  The wideband slot antennas can be realized by utilizing a 
unique tapered-slot feeding structure [25] or a feeding scheme to generate multiple resonances of close bands 
[26], [27].  Planar monopole antennas have been found as good candidates for UWB applications owing to 
their attractive merits, such as ultrawide impedance bandwidth, simple structure and ease of fabrication, and 
good radiation properties. Typical shapes of these antennas are half-disc [28], circle, ellipse [29], [30], 
rectangle [31], [32], and Binomial curved [33].  
In practice, interference is a serious problem for UWB application systems.  Despite the approval of the 
FCC for UWB to operate over 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, it may be necessary to notch-out portions of the band in order 
to avoid interference with the existing wireless networking technologies such as IEEE 802.11a in the U.S. 
(5.15–5.35 GHz, 5.725–5.825 GHz) and HIPERLAN/2 in Europe (5.15–5.35 GHz, 5.47–5.725 GHz). This is 
due to the fact that UWB transmitters should not cause any electromagnetic interference to nearby 
communication system such as the wireless local area network (WLAN) applications, and vice versa. 
Therefore, UWB antennas with notched characteristics in the WLAN frequency band are required.  There are 
various methods to achieve the band-notched function.  The conventional methods are cutting a slot on the 
patch [34]-[36], inserting a slit on the patch [37]-[39], or embedding a quarter-wavelength tuning stub within a 
large slot on the patch [40].  Recently, the band-notched UWB antenna are realized by embedding a pair of 
T-shaped stubs inside an ellipse slot cut in the radiation patch [41] or using an open-looped resonator at the 
center of a fork-shaped antenna [42].  Even though these approaches may have good rejection performance, 
the achieved notch bandwidth is usually limited since only one radiation null is designed in most of these 
researches.  Also, the required transition bandwidth between the pass and notch bands are extended, which 
will thus encroach upon the usable pass band.

Figure 2.2  (a) Equivalent circuit of the coupled line resonator with equal lengths.  (b) The composite shunt resonator with two 
series LC resonators in parallel. (c) The equivalent shunt LC resonator around the resonant frequency fr. 
 
The coupled line resonator with equal lengths shown in Figure (a) is composed of a quarter-wavelength 
open-circuited stub and a quarter-wavelength short-circuited stub.  These two resonant microstrip stubs 
couple with each other through the gap between them.  Physically, the open-circuited stub is equivalent to a 
series LC resonator, and the short-circuited stub a shunt LC resonator.  And the coupling gap, which mainly 
offers electrical coupling between the resonators, functions as an admittance inverter (or J-inverter) [47].  
Therefore, the proposed structure can be equivalent to the circuit shown in Figure (a).  Note that due to the 
presence of the coupling, the two resonators (La, Ca) and ( bL , bC ) have different resonant frequencies, 
although the two coupled stubs are with equal lengths.  This equivalent circuit can be further transformed 
into the circuit shown in Figure (b), which consists of two series LC resonators connected in parallel, with 
resonant frequencies at fa and fb, respectively.  It is thus evident that the proposed structure provides two 
transmission zeros at these two resonant frequencies.   
We now set up the quantitative equivalence between the coupled line resonator (Figure (a)) and the 
equivalent circuit (Figure (b)) in the following three steps: First, derive the input admittances of the circuits; 
secondly, equate the two admittances and their derivatives, respectively, at the center frequency, and also let 
the two circuits with the same transmission zeros; thirdly, extract the equivalent circuit components from the 
above-obtained equations. 
In the first step, one first derives the admittances of these two circuits as [47]:

respectively. Z0e and Z0o are the even-mode and odd-mode impedances of the coupled line.　 is the

The circuit components L1, C1 can thus be calculated while the impedances (Z0e, Z0o) and fr are given. 
Figure  shows the circuit simulation results by AWR [48] for a coupled line resonator with line width of 
0.5 mm and gap 0.2 mm, fabricated on a 0.508 mm thick Rogers 4003 substrate with a dielectric constant 3.38 
and loss tangent of 0.0027.  Here, the ideal transmission lines for the coupled line resonator are considered.  
The electric length of the coupled lines is  = 90 , which corresponds to a resonant frequency at 2.5 GHz.  
To get the equivalent circuits, one first calculates the impedances Z0e and Z0o as 100 and 57 , respectively.  
Then, based on (2.2c) and (2.2d), the two transmission zeros, fa and fb, are calculated to be 2.05 GHz and 2.95 
GHz.  Finally, the circuit components in Figure (b) and (c) can be obtained by using (2.2a), (2.2b), (2.3), and 
(2.4), which are (La, Ca) = (8.46 nH, 0.71 pF), (Lb, Cb) = (7.07 nH, 0.41 pF), and  (L1, C1) = (0.49 nH, 8.26 
pF).  It is seen from the figure that, the frequency responses of the equivalent circuit in Figure (b) match very 
well with those of the coupled line resonator over the full frequency band.  Not only with the same 
transmission pole and zeros, the curves are completely overlapped in the frequency range between fa and fb.  
Also, the responses of the circuit in Figure (c) agree well with the ones of the coupled line resonator near the 
resonant frequency fr.

As will be shown later, when designing a filtering antenna, the equivalent circuit components are first 
obtained based on the filter specifications, from which the structure dimensions have to be decided.  To this 
end, one may use (2.2c) and (2.4) to derive the even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances of the coupled 
line resonator as:

2.2 Coupled Open-/Short-Circuited Stub Resonator 
 
To realize the series LC resonator, one usually uses a /4 open-circuited microstrip stub.  However, this 
resonant stub shows only a transmission zero at the resonant frequency, and thus presents low skirt selectivity 
at the band edges.  A /4 open-/short-circuited stub resonator [49], as shown in Figure (a), had been 
proposed to increase the band-edge selectivity.  This circuit behaves as a series LC resonator at the center 
frequency due to the /4 open-circuited stub.  And at a frequency lower (higher) than the center one, the 
open-circuited (short-circuited) stub shows a capacitive reactance and the short-circuited (open-circuited) stub 
an inductive reactance, so that the whole circuit behaves as a shunt LC resonator.  It turns out that the 
open-/short-circuited stub resonator exhibits a transmission zero at the center frequency and a pair of 
symmetric transmission poles at the two sides.  Nevertheless, due to the low inductance of the series LC 
resonator near the center frequency, this stub resonator presents wider notch-band bandwidth, which is not 
suitable for designing a narrow-band bandstop filter as that in the present study. 
To solve this problem, here we propose a coupled /4 open-/short-circuited stub resonator as shown in 
Figure (b).  Moreover, an extended version with different lengths of coupled stubs as shown in Figure (c) is 
also introduced.  As shown below, this new structure exhibits higher inductance near the center frequency 
due to the introduction of the coupling mechanism, which fits the requirement of the current design.  It also 
has the advantage of producing a pair of asymmetric transmission poles that is contributive to the design 
flexibility. Besides these good points, the new structure occupies less circuit area due to the close spacing of 
the two stubs. As the conventional structure, the coupled stub resonator can be equivalent to a series LC 
resonator (Figure (d)) near the center frequency.

we optimize the values of the circuit components so that the reflection coefficient (S11), as a function of 
frequency, of the equivalent circuit coincides with that simulated from the antenna in a frequency range as 
wide as possible.  The differenceS11 of the reflection coefficient between these two curves is set not 
beyond 3% in a 20% frequency bandwidth centered at the antenna resonant frequency.

where f0 is the center frequency of the bandpass filter and is chosen as 2.45 GHz in this work.  In the 
process of establishing the antenna database, the antenna frequency fA, which is determined by the total strip 
lengths (l1 + l2  /4), should be slightly larger than f0 due to the existence of the parasitic capacitance Cg.  
This frequency corresponds to the frequency location of the minimum value of the antenna’s reflection

It is noted that the radiation resistance RA and the inductance LA are mainly dependent on the vertical 
strip length l1 due to the strongest current distribution on this strip. Also, the parasitic capacitance Cg is 
decided by the strip width w and independent of the strip length l1.  It is thus observed that the values of the

Figure  shows the comparison of the impedance behaviors on the Smith chart from the full-wave 
simulation and the equivalent circuit calculation.  The dimensions of the inverted-L antenna, which is to be 
used later in the synthesis of the filtering antenna, are l1 = 10 mm, w = 1.17 mm, and l2 = 17.25 mm. The 
extracted circuit components are LA = 14.2 nH, CA = 0.30 pF, RA = 28.6 , and Cg = 0.37 pF, with the 
corresponding quality factor QA = 7.65.  Notice that Cg has the same level as CA so that this parasitic 
capacitance can not be neglected in the modeling of the antenna.  It is seen from the figure that the curve of 
S11 for the equivalent circuit agrees well with the full-wave simulation one from 1.5 GHz to 4 GHz.  
Especially, they have the same value at the antenna resonant frequency (fA = 2.53 GHz), and the 
differenceS11 is 0.16 dB (error of S　 11 3%) at f = 2.28 GHz and 0.148 dB (error of S11 3%) at f = 2.81 
GHz.

3.1.2 Inverted-F Antenna 
 
Figure 3.4(a) and (b) shows the dimensions of the inverted-F antenna and the corresponding equivalent 
circuit at the antenna feed point looking toward the antenna.  The inverted-F antenna can be modeled as a 
short-circuited transmission line of length s in shunt with a main series RLC resonance near the first resonant 
frequency [52].  Here, LA and CA express the resonant inductance and capacitance of the antenna, 
respectively.  RA is the antenna radiation resistance produced by the vertical strips, including the left- and 
right-side strips in Figure 3.4(a).  Alternately, the inverted-F antenna is treated as a small loop inductor, 
which can be seen a short-circuited transmission line, consisting of the two vertical strips and horizontal strip 
l2. 
The inverted-F antenna is printed on a 0.8 mm RF4 substrate with a dielectric constant of 4.4 and loss 
17 
 
components of the RA, LA, and (Z0s, s) when the antenna is resonated at f0, and then, taking these three 
components into (3.2a), the resonant frequency fA can be obtained.  Various values of l1 have been analyzed 
in this study.  It is found out that, the antenna with different dimensions of l1 has the resonant frequency fA 
between 2.41 GHz to 2.45 GHz while f0 is 2.45GHz. 
Figure 3.5(a) shows the variation of the radiation resistance RA and quality factor QA as a function of the 
vertical strip length l1 and fixed l2.  It can be observed that the radiation resistance RA increases substantially 
from 25  to 95 when the strip length l1 changes from 5 mm to 13 mm.  In the same l1 variation range, the 
inductance LA (not shown in this figure) has only little change (from 12 nH to 14.5 nH).  The radiation 
resistance increases much fast than the inductance as the strip length increases, which results in a decreasing 
quality factor due to (3.3).  As seen, the quality factor changes from 13.7 to 6.0 when l1 increases from 5 mm 
to 13 mm.  Although not shown here, the strip width w has minor influence on the values of equivalent 
circuit components.  As to the application in the synthesis of the proposed filtering antenna, once the quality 
factor QA is determined by the given specifications of filter (the relationship will be derived later), the values 
of l1 and RA can be obtained via the QA-to-l1 and RA-to-l1 curves in Figure 3.4(a), respectively, and then the

3.2.1 Synthesis of the Filtering Antenna 
 
Figure 3.8(a) shows the proposed filtering antenna, which contains N coupled line sections and an 
inverted-L antenna. Note that the antenna is connected directly to the N-th coupled line.  The filter to be 
synthesized is an N-th order Chebyshev bandpass filter.  The N-1 filter resonators are provided by the 
coupled line sections and the last one by the inverted-L antenna.  In order to match to the low antenna 
radiation resistance and increase the flexibility of design, here the N-th coupled line has different design as the 
conventional ones.  Consider a coupled line section with even- and odd-mode characteristic impedances 
'
0eNZ  and '0oNZ , respectively, as shown in Figure (a), which is to be equivalent to the circuit shown in Figure 
(b) near the center frequency f0.  The right transmission line section in Figure (b) has a characteristic 
impedance Za, which is different from the system impedance Z0 (= 50 )and can be selected arbitrarily.  To 
have the same circuit performances near the center frequency, the ABCD matrices of the coupled line section 
and the equivalent circuit should be equal at / 2   , resulting into

antenna’s parasitic capacitance Cg should be moved to the left-hand side of the admittance inverter NJ   as

The design procedures of the proposed filtering antenna can now be summarized as follows: 
1) Specify the requirements of the bandpass filter to be synthesized, including the center frequency f0, the 
fractional bandwidth Δ, and the type of the filter (e.g., bandpass filter with equal ripple), from which the 
admittance inverters JnZ0 (n = 1, 2, …, N+1) and the parallel resonators Ln, Cn (n = 1, 2, …, N) in Figure 
(d) can be determined [47]. 
2) Choose an antenna structure with suitable equivalent circuit that can substitute for the last resonator and

The full-wave simulated return loss of the proposed filtering antenna in comparison with that of the 
conventional third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter is shown in Figure (a). The simulated return loss of a 
second-order bandpass filter directly cascaded with a 50  inverted-L antenna is also shown for reference.  It 
is noticed that both of the proposed filtering antenna and filter directly cascaded with an antenna are 
third-order circuit, with two orders provided by the circuit and one by the antenna. These two structures 
occupy about the same circuit area. Here, the conventional third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter has the same 
specifications as the filtering antenna (14% bandwidth and 0.1 dB equal-ripple response).  And the filter in 
the reference structure is a second-order Chebyshev bandpass filter with the same bandwidth and ripple level.  
It is observed that the bandwidth and skirt selectivity for the proposed filtering antenna agree very well with 
the conventional third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter, which demonstrates the design validity of the filtering 
antenna.  On the other hand, putting an individually designed antenna after the bandpass filter via a simple 
cascaded 50  microstrip line, not only have no contribution to the order of the filter, but also deteriorate the 
original filter performance, especially resulting in bad skirt selectivity at the band edges. 
Figure (b) compares the measured return losses of the proposed filtering antenna and the conventional 
third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter.  The simulated return loss of the filtering antenna is also shown for 
comparison.  Likely because of the deviations in dielectric constant and substrate thickness, the bandwidth of 
the measured return loss of the proposed filtering antenna is slightly narrower than the simulated one.  
However, it is in close agreement with the measured one of the conventional third-order Chebyshev bandpass 
filter.  Both have the same passband poles’ positions, the selectivity at the band edge, and the return-loss 
behavior at the stopband. This demonstrates that the proposed filtering antenna has good selectivity in 
accordance with the conventional bandpass filter.

Figure 3.12(b) shows the full-wave simulated antenna gains in the +z direction versus frequency for the 
proposed filtering antenna and the reference structure of a 2nd-order filter directly cascaded with antenna.  
The simulated insertion loss of the conventional third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter is also shown for 
comparison. Since the inverted-L antenna has an omni-directional field pattern in the xz-plane, has only the 
antenna gain in the +z direction is discussed.  As compared to the reference structure, the antenna gain of the 
proposed filtering antenna is flat in the passband and the bandwidth is very close to the insertion-loss 
bandwidth of the third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter. The proposed filtering antenna also provides better 
skirt selectivity with stopband suppression better than 22 dB. The measured antenna gains for the proposed 
filtering antenna is also depicted in Figure 3.12(b), which shows an antenna gain, including the circuitry loss, 
of -1.3 dBi.  It is obvious that the measurement matches well to the simulation.  The amplitude noise of the 
measured gain in the stopbands is due to the system noise of the antenna chamber. 
In Figure 3.12(b), a radiation null at f = 2.15 GHz in the +z direction, which makes the skirt selectivity 
better than that of the conventional bandpass filter, has been observed.  Since an inverted-L antenna alone 
should exhibit a monotonous gain dropping, but not a local gain minimum when the operating frequency 
moves away from the antenna’s resonant frequency.  Also, since it has been found that the frequency

3.3 Compact Printed Filtering Antennas Using a Ground-Intruded Coupled Line 
Resonator 
 
In this section, the compact printed filtering antennas with high band-edge gain selectivity are presented, 
as shown in Figure 3.16.  Occupying about the same substrate area as a conventional antenna, the proposed 
structure not only serves as a radiator but also a second-order bandpass filter, with one filter pole provided by 
an antenna and the other by a newly proposed coupled line resonator.  High band-edge selectivity is achieved 
due to two additional stop-band transmission zeros provided by the coupled line resonator. To minimize the 
required area and reduce the spurious radiation, a coupled line structure composed of a microstrip line and a 
coplanar waveguide by broadside coupling is adopted and intruded into an antenna area.   According to the 
filter specifications, a design procedure for the proposed filtering antenna is depicted in detail.  As compared

circuit here so that the whole circuit would have the same impedance behavior as the antenna itself in a wider 
frequency range, as depicted in Section 3.1.1.  This parasitic capacitance comes from the accumulation of 
charges around the antenna feed point due to the truncation of the ground plane.

Figure 3.17  (a) The geometry of the second-order filtering antenna. (b) The corresponding equivalent circuit of the –shaped 
antenna. 
 
By using the equivalent circuits of the coupled line resonator and the –shaped antenna, the second-order 
filtering antenna can be expressed by the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 3.18(a).  It can be observed that 
not only second-order response but also two extra transmission zeros near the filter’s band-edge can be 
produced.  Figure 3.18(b) is a further equivalent circuit of the filtering antenna while the resonant frequency 
of the coupled line resonator is near fr.  This circuit can then be transformed to a typical second-order 
bandpass filter as shown in Figure 3.18(c), where L2 = LA, C2 = CA, R0 = RA, and '1C = C1 + Cg.  Note that 
due to the existence of the small capacitance Cg, the required resonant frequency fr (   11 1 = 2 L C  ) of the 
coupled line resonator is slightly larger than the operating frequency f0 (   1'1 1 = 2 L C    12 2 = 2 L C  ) of 
the bandpass filter.

and loss tangent of 0.0027.  The ground plane size L×W = 50 mm×50 mm.  In the design, the full-wave 
simulation solver HFSS [51] is used for fine tuning in the last procedure.  According to the design procedure, 
the specifications of the filter should be firstly chosen.  Here, the bandpass filter has a operating frequency f0 
= 2.45 GHz, a fractional bandwidth Δ = 14%, and Z0  = 50 .  The lower transmission zero fa is set at 2 GHz, 
and the higher transmission zero fb is 3.3 GHz.  Based on these requirements, the circuit components of the 
filter can be calculated, which are L1 = 0.54 nH, 1 7.82C   pF, L2 = 14.43 nH, C2 = 0.29 pF, and R0 = 37 .  
Secondly, we have to determine the antenna sizes. After numerous simulations, we choose the dimensions of 
the -shaped antenna as l1 = 15.2 mm, l2 = 11.5 mm, l3 = 3.1 mm, and w = 1.17 mm, which correspond to a set 
of extracted component values (i.e., LA = 14.4 nH, CA = 0.29 pF, RA = 37 , Cg = 0.37 pF) nearest to required 
one. 
Thirdly, the circuit component C1 and the resonant frequency fr of the coupled line resonator are 
calculated, which are 7.45 pF and 2.51 GHz, respectively.  The characteristic impedances (Z0e, Z0o) = (89, 
47 ) can then be gotten by using (2.5) and the given lower transmission zero, with which the dimensions of 
the coupled line resonator of equal lengths are obtained.  The resultant line width, gap size, and length of the 
coupled line are 0.64 mm, 0.15 mm, and 18.9 mm, respectively.  Finally, to reach a transmission zero at 3.3 
GHz, the electric length 1 of the open-circuited stub is shortened from 90  to 70  by simulation.  To this 
end, all the structure dimensions have been determined.  And the filtering antenna can be implemented by 
connecting the coupled line resonator and the -shaped antenna, as shown in Figure 3.17(a). 
Figure 3.19(a) shows the full-wave simulated return loss of the designed filtering antenna.  The 
simulated result of the –shaped antenna only is also shown for reference.  The proposed filtering antenna 
exhibits a return loss larger than 15 dB over the passband, and provides better band-edge selectivity as 
compared to the –shaped antenna only.  Also observe that, with the center frequency at 2.45 GHz, the 
filtering antenna possesses two transmission poles at 2.33 GHz and 2.57 GHz, which are caused from the 
repel of resonant frequencies due to mutual coupling between the coupled line resonator and –shaped 
antenna [54].  Although not shown here, it has been found that the lower and higher transmission poles can 
be tuned independently by the coupled line resonator and the antenna, respectively.

3.3.2 Compact Second-Order Filtering Antenna I 
 
Although the proposed filtering antenna shown in Figure 3.17(a) exhibits good radiation and filtering 
performances, it still occupies extra circuit area due to the use of the coupled line resonator.  To realize a 
compact filtering antenna, a miniaturized coupled line resonator composed of a microstrip line open-circuited 
stub and a coplanar waveguide short-circuited stub by broadside coupling is proposed, as shown in Figure 
3.21, to intrude into the -shaped antenna area.  Herein, an extended ground plane (W1 × L1) is employed for 
designing the folded coupled line resonator.

Figure 3.22(b) illustrates the effect of the line width wc of the coplanar waveguide stub.  As wc increases, 
the center frequency remains the same due to the same short-circuited stub length (/4).  While the two 
transmission zeros move away from the center frequency.  This is because the increase of wc causes a 
stronger mutual coupling between the microstrip line and the coplanar waveguide, which thus results in a 
larger ratio of Z0e/Z0o.  Therefore, from (2.2c) and (2.2d), the lower transmission zero appears at a lower 
frequency and the higher zero at a higher frequency. 
In summary, the intruded miniaturized coupled line resonator follows the behaviors depicted in Section 
2.1.  Thus, the design methodology described in the previous section can be applied directly to the proposed 
compact filtering antenna (Figure 3.16(a)).  In the design, the filter specifications to be achieved and the 
dimensions of the –shaped antenna are set the same as those in Section 3.3.1.  And the final dimensions of 
the miniaturized coupled line resonator are listed in Table 3.1.  Figure 3.23(a) and (b) shows the full-wave 
simulated and measured return losses and total radiated powers, respectively, of the compact filtering antenna.  
The simulated results of the –shaped antenna are also shown for reference.  It is seen that the full-wave 
simulated results of the compact filtering antenna are almost the same as those of the original design (Figure 
3.17(a)), which show two filter poles at 2.3 GHz and 2.6 GHz and two radiation nulls at 2.11 GHz and 3.31 
GHz. The simulated radiation efficiency at operating frequency f0 = 2.45 is about 82%, slightly lower than the 
original design, and those at the two transmission zeros are 0.7% and 1.1%.  The measured results agree 
quite well with the simulations.  It is evident that, without suffering from the need of extra circuit area, the 
proposed compact filtering antenna shown in Figure 3.16(a) has a flat passband radiation power as a function 
of frequency, high band-edge selectivity, and good stop-band suppression.

respectively.  According to the behaviors of the inverted-F antenna and the miniaturized coupled line 
resonator that depicted in Section 3.1.2 and Section 3.3.2, respectively, the suitable dimensions of the coupled

Figure 3.28 compares the simulated and measured return losses of the proposed filtering antenna.  The 
simulated result of the spiraled inverted-F antenna is also shown for reference.  Likely because of the 
deviations in dielectric constant and substrate thickness, the bandwidth of the measured return loss of the 
proposed filtering antenna is slightly narrower than the simulated one.  The proposed filtering antenna 
exhibits a return loss larger than 15 dB over the passband, and provides better band-edge selectivity as 
compared the spiraled inverted-F antenna only.   
Figure 3.29(a) shows the full-wave simulated and measured normalized total radiated powers of the 
compact filtering antenna.  The simulated result of the spiraled inverted-F antenna is also shown for 
reference.  It is seen that the full-wave simulated result of the compact filtering antenna shows two radiation 
nulls at 2.11 GHz and 3.12 GHz.  The simulated radiation efficiency at operating frequency f0 = 2.45 is about 
70%, and those at the two transmission zeros are 1.1% and 1.6%.  The lower radiation efficiency at operating

Figure 3.30 depicts the measured radiation patterns of the compact filtering antenna at f0 = 2.45 GHz in

results of the spiraled inverted-F antenna alone. Figure 3.31 shows the photograph of the finished compact 
filtering antenna.

Chapter 4 Band-Notched UWB Monopole Antenna 
This chapter presents a novel design of band-notched ultra-wide-band (UWB) monopole antenna with 
high notch-band-edge selectivity.  The proposed antenna consists of a radiation patch and an embedded 
second-order bandstop filter.   Using the same substrate area as a fundamental UWB antenna, a bandstop 
filter composed of a non-uniform short-circuited stub and coupled open-/short-circuited stub resonators, is 
designed into the fundamental antenna.  A detail design procedure for the proposed antenna with a 
second-order Maxially-flat bandstop filter at 5.5 GHz is presented.  As compared to the fundamental antenna, 
the proposed UWB antenna provides good notch-band suppression from 5.15 GHz to 5.95 GHz in which the 
normalized total radiated powers in the notch-band are lower than -12 dB.  Also, the proposed structure 
provides high band-edge selectivity and flat return loss in the notch-band.  The measured results, including 
the return loss, total radiated power, agree with the designed ones. 
 
4.1 Antenna Configuration and Equivalent Circuit 
 
Figure 4.1(a) shows the geometry of the proposed UWB antenna, which is a three-layer structure with 
two FR4 substrates in between.  Each substrate has a thickness of 0.4 mm, dielectric constant of 4.4, and loss 
tangent of 0.02.  Figure 4.1(b), (c), and (d) depict, respectively, the top view, middle view, and bottom view 
of antenna layout.  A signal is to be fed from a 50 Ω microstrip feed line with signal line on the top layer and 
ground on the bottom layer. The signal line is connected to a trapezoid patch (with dimensions of wb1, wb2, lb) 
at point A as shown in Figure 4.1(b).  The trapezoid patch is then connected to a pentagon patch on the 
middle layer through a row of vias (heavy dots in Figure 4.1(b) and (c)).  Here, the pentagon patch (with 
dimensions of la, wa, ls, ws), together with the ground plane on the bottom layer, is the main UWB radiator.  
Apparently, these two metal patches form a non-uniform short-circuited stub when looking upwards at the 
port between points A and C (Figure 4.1(c)).  The length lb of the stub is about a quarter guided wavelength 
at the center frequency of the notch band.  On the bottom layer, two closely spaced strips of different lengths 
are joined to the ground plane at point B as shown in Figure 4.1(d). The shorter strip is connected to the 
radiation patch on the middle layer through a via.  Therefore, when looking upwards at the port between 
points C and B, one sees a coupled short-circuited stub and open-circuited stub in shunt.  The lengths of 
these two stubs are both near to a quarter guided wavelength at the notch band. Note that the pentagon patch 
not only behaves as a radiator but also the ground plane of these stub resonators.  The whole antenna size W 
× L measures 30 mm × 27.6 mm, including the ground plane size W × lg of 30 mm × 10 mm. 
Figure 4.2 illustrates the equivalent circuit of the proposed antenna around the notch band.  To realize 
this circuit, let us start from the feed point A of the antenna.  Since the non-uniform short-circuited stub is a 
quarter-wavelength long, a shunt LC resonator (L1, C1) with resonant frequency at 5.5 GHz appears in 
between points A and C.  Between point C and ground point B, two circuit components are connected in 
parallel.  The first is the coupled stub resonator, which functions as a series LC resonator (L2, C2), mainly 
due to the open-circuited stub.  And the second is the UWB antenna, formed by the pentagon patch on the 
middle layer and the ground plane on the bottom layer.  Here, since the antenna is to be designed with good 
45 
 
4.2 Antenna Design 
 
In this section, the design of the fundamental UWB monopole antenna covering the full UWB band 
(3.1-10.6 GHz) is first introduced.  And then, the non-uniform short-circuited stub resonator is tackled.  By 
using the coupled open-/short-circuited stub resonator that discussed in Chapter 2.2, a second-order bandstop 
filter can be realized.  Finally, the synthesis of the proposed band-notched UWB monopole antenna is 
summarized.  
 
A. Fundamental UWB Antenn 
 
Various radiation patch shapes of the planar monopole antennas have been studied and utilized to attain 
the UWB properties.  Figure 4.3(a) shows the fundamental UWB monopole antenna used in this study.  The 
radiation patch is connected to the  microstrip line on the top side of the FR4 substrate with thickness of 
0.4 mm.  The pentagonal shape of the radiator is obtained by trimming the lower edge of a square patch so as 
to enhance the upper bandwidth.  Since a monopole-like UWB antenna at higher frequency usually behaves 
as a slot antenna [31], properly designing the shape of the bevels on the lower side will certainly improve the 
excitation of the slot-mode radiation.  On the other hand, the current at low frequency is mainly distributed 
over the patch and the ground plane, which is similar to that of a printed finite-ground monopole antenna.  
For a given ground plane length (lg), the patch length, la, will determine the lowest operation frequency.  The 
gap, g, between the pentagon patch and the ground plane is also an important parameter, which will influence 
the impedance matching of the antenna.  The final design of the fundamental UWB antenna measures the 
following structure dimensions:  wa × la = 14 mm × 15.7 mm, ws × ls = 6.24 mm × 1.4 mm, g = 0.5 mm, and 
W × lg = 30 mm × 10 mm. Figure 4.3(b) shows the simulated input impedance by using the full-wave 
simulation solver HFSS [51].  As expected, the real part of the impedance is near 50  and the imaginary 
part almost zero, especially in the range from 4 GHz to 7.5 GHz.  The input impedance of the antenna can be 
further improved over a wider frequency range by properly shaping the ground plane edge.

C. Synthesis of the Antenna 
 
After designing all the required components as above and the coupled open-/short-circuited stub 
resonator in Section 2.2, one may now integrate them together to synthesize the band-notched UWB antenna 
by using the following steps: 
1) Suitably design the fundamental UWB antenna as shown in Figure 4.3(a) with the bandwidth covering 
from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz. 
2) Specify the requirements of the bandstop filter to be synthesized, including the operating frequency f0, 
the fractional bandwidth Δ, and the type of the filter (e.g., bandstop filter with maximally flat response), 
from which the circuit elements (L1, C1, L2, C2) of a typical bandstop filter in Figure 4.2 can be obtained 
by using the following equations [47]:

filter [47]. 
3) Using the component values of C1 and L2 obtained above; determine the dimensions of the non-uniform 
short-circuited stub and the coupled stub resonators with equal stub length according to Figure 4.4 and 
Figure 2.6, respectively. 
4) Properly shorten the short-circuited stub’s length (c1) in the coupled stub resonator (as shown Figure 
2.5(c)) so as to adjust the positions of the transmission poles until the bandwidth of the whole UWB 
antenna is enough. 
 
4.3 Experimental Results 
 
Following the above design procedures, the fundamental UWB monopole antenna is first designed with 
dimensions of wa × la = 14 mm × 15.7 mm, ws × ls = 6.24 mm × 1.4 mm, and g = 0.5 mm.  Secondly, based 
on the requirement of band notch from 5.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz, the embedded bandstop filter is specified as one 
with maximally flat response, center frequency  f0 = 5.5 GHz, fractional bandwidth Δ= 18%, and Z0 =50.  
Thus, the circuit components of the filter can be calculated, using (1) and (2), as L1 = 0.37 nH, C1 = 2 .27 pF, 
L2 = 5.68 nH, and C2 = 0.15 pF.  Then, with the value of C1 and from Figure 5.4, the dimensions of the 
non-uniform short-circuited stub can be decided, which are wb1 = 2.5 mm, wb2 = 12 mm, and lb =8.6 mm.  
Also, by using the calculated component L2 and Figure 2.6, the line width and gap size of the /4 coupled 
open-/short-circuited stub resonator with equal length can be obtained, which are 0.12mm, 0.12mm, 
respectively.  To this step, one now assembles all the components according Figure 4.1 to form the 
49 
 
Figure 4.5(b) shows the full-wave simulated and measured total radiated powers of the proposed 
band-notched UWB antenna, together with simulated one of the fundamental UWB antenna.  Here, the total 
radiated power has been normalized to the input power, which is thus equal to the efficiency of the antenna.  
Note that the total radiated power is measured only from 2 to 8 GHz due to the limited frequency range of the 
available 3D RF anechoic chamber.  It is seen that the simulated result of the proposed UWB antenna has 
two radiation nulls at 5.25 GHz and 5.8 GHz.  As compared to the fundamental UWB antenna, the proposed 
antenna provides good notch-band suppression from 5 GHz to 6 GHz in which the normalized total radiated 
power is lower than -10 dB.  Also, the proposed structure possesses high notch-band-edge selectivity.  The 
simulated radiation efficiency of the proposed UWB antenna at the frequency of 5.5 GHz is only 7.5% and at 
the two radiation nulls are less than 5%.  While outside the notch band, the proposed antenna has about the 
same total radiation power (or antenna efficiency) as the fundamental UWB antenna.  The measured result of 
the proposed structure agrees quite well with the simulated one. 
Figure 4.6 illustrates the simulated current distributions at 4 GHz, 5.5 GHz, and 8 GHz for the proposed 
antenna structure. It is seen that at frequencies (4 GHz and 8 GHz) in the passband, many currents are 
distributed around the radiation patch and the ground plane, which contribute to the radiation of the antenna.  
The current distribution at the low frequency (4 GHz) is standing-wave type, like that of a monopole antenna, 
and that at the high frequency (8 GHz) is traveling-wave type, corresponding to a tapered slot antenna.  On 
the contrary, the current at the notch frequency (5.5 GHz) is mainly concentrated on the non-uniform 
short-circuited stub and the coupled stub resonator.  The current on the radiation patch and the ground plane 
is much weaker, thus resulting in a negligible radiation field as compared to those at frequencies in the 
passband.

4.4 Summary 
 
A new UWB monopole antenna with band-notched characteristic in the frequency range from 5 GHz to 6 
GHz has been proposed and demonstrated. Occupying about the same substrate area as a conventional UWB 
antenna, a second-order bandstop filter, realized by a non-uniform short-circuited stub and an 
open-/short-circuited stub resonator, has been designed to merge into the UWB antenna.  The measured 
10-dB return loss bandwidth covered the range from 2.4 GHz to over 11 GHz with a 3-dB notched band from 
5.0 GHz to 6.0 GHz.  Good notch-band rejection and notch-band-edge selectivity were achieved.  Also, the 
measured radiation patterns of the proposed antenna in the H plane are omni-directional, with antenna gains 
about 0 dBi at frequencies in the passband and below -10 dBi at notch frequencies.  Finally, the measured 
results, including the return loss and total radiated power, showed good agreement with the design ones.

A Compact Edge-Fed Filtering Microstrip Antenna  
with 0.2 dB Equal-Ripple Response

Abstract— A compact microstrip antenna with a second order 0.2 
dB equal-ripple response and 4 % fractional bandwidth is 
proposed. This design follows the synthesis process of the 
bandpass filter. The radiating patch is fed by a new edge-fed gap-
coupling mechanism. The coupling section excites the antenna, 
and it can be an admittance inverter for the filter design as well. 
Moreover, it does not occupy any additional circuit area. The 
proposed antenna has the size of 0.6λg × 0.6λg, where λg is the 
guiding wavelength in the substrate. The antenna provides good 
selectivity, flat in-band antenna gain response, and good out-
band rejection. The measurement results agree with the 
simulated ones.  
I. INTRODUCTION 
In an RF front-end system, a bandpass filter is usually 
cascaded to the antenna to reject spurious signal that received 
or transmitted by the antenna. For reducing the circuit size and 
increasing the system performance, one of the options is to 
integrate the bandpass filter and the antenna in a single 
module which has both the filtering and the radiating function.  
In most of the antenna designs, the antenna itself is a 
resonator which resonates at the operation frequency. The 
radiation loss can be modelled by the radiation resistance of 
the antenna. Hence, the antenna has an equivalent RLC 
resonator response and can be treated as the last stage of the 
filter with a resistive load in filter design.  
Several researches on antenna design follow the synthesis 
process of the bandpass filter [1-4]. However, these structures 
are complicated, and the in-band response, the band-edge skirt 
steepness, and the out-band suppression generally do not have 
performances. In [4], a patch antenna and one stage filter are 
integrated in a module. This structure needs an extra 
microstrip section as an admittance inverter. In order to save 
the circuit size, we replace the extra admittance inverter by the 
edge-fed gap-coupling scheme.  
The edge-fed gap-coupling methodology was proposed by 
Kumar et. al. [5-6]. Several radiating patches are placed 
beside the feeding patch for broadband characteristics. Yet, 
the size of the gap-feed patch antenna is too large for practical 
usage. Some recent researches on the gap coupling feed 
scheme are summarized in [7]. Still, the required circuit areas 
are huge.  
In this paper, we develop an antenna with the filtering 
function by the synthesis process of bandpass filters [8]. 
Additionally, a new edge-fed gap-coupling methodology for 
exciting the antenna was presented. The coupling section not 
only feeds the antenna, but also acts as the admittance inverter 
in the filter synthesis procedure. Most important of all, it does 
not need an additional space.   
II. ANTENNA CONFIGURATION  
The antenna design starts from the bandpass filter prototype 
[8]. The first step is to design an equal-ripple response lumped 
element filter at 12 GHz with 0.2 dB ripples and 4 % 
fractional bandwidth. The circuit model is shown in Fig. 1. 
Two parallel LC-resonators resonate at 12 GHz with the 
element values C1 = C2 = 5.9 pF and L1 = L2 = 0.03 nH. These 
two resonators are connected by an admittance inverter which 
is implemented by the standard Π-section capacitors with CC 
= 0.308 pF. The load impedance and the port impedance are 
set to be RL = 50 Ω and Z0 = 50 Ω, respectively.

constant, namely, a travelling wave flowing in +x-direction 
with no reflection. Thus, the structure is well-matched.  
For the inverted-U shape radiating patch, most of the 
current distributes around the slot and on the left/right edges 
of the radiating patch. The current on the left/right edges 
flows in y-direction and forms a standing wave. This is similar 
to the current distribution of the regular square patch antenna 
operating at TM010 mode.  
A small portion of the current flows on the upper edge of 
the inverted-U shape patch. It flows in x-direction and 
contributes to the cross-polarization radiation.  
The L-shape resonator and the patch are coupled by the gap 
inside the slot. The current around the slot is induced by the 
section of the L-shape inserted in the slot, and flows in an 
opposite direction. The idea of the coupling section is similar 
to the parallel-coupled line bandpass filter. The slot between 
the inverted-U shape patch and the L-shape resonator forms 
an admittance inverter in filter design. Therefore, an extra 
circuit area is not needed for designing the admittance inverter.  
V. CONCLUSIONS 
With a second order 0.2 dB equal-ripple response and 4 % 
fractional bandwidth, a microstrip antenna operating at 12 
GHz is proposed. The design follows the synthesis process of 
the bandpass filter. An edge-fed gap-coupled mechanism 
without suffering more circuit area is developed, and it also 
acts as admittance inverter in the filter design. The antenna 
provides good selectivity and flat in-band antenna gain 
response.

with high capacitance is selected, the large circuit area for the 
resonator should be required; it is not a convenient way to 
design the filtering antenna.  Therefore, in this work, a new 
structure of λ/4 resonator is proposed, which can resolve this 
issue.  Fig. 2(a) illustrates the geometry of the proposed λ/4 
resonator, which composes of an open-stub λ/4 microstrip 
resonator and a short-end λ/4 microstrip resonator.  It is noted 
that the short-end λ/4 microstrip resonator is coupled by the 
open-stub λ/4 microstrip resonator.  The equivalent circuit of 
the proposed λ/4 resonator is shown in Fig. 2(b) and its 
further equivalent circuit with the composite shunt resonator 
can be shown in Figs. 2(c).  For the composite shunt resonator, 
the two series resonators have reactance Xa and Xb, and 
resonate at fa and fb, respectively.  Suppose fa< f <fb, it can be 
observed that Xa>0 is inductive and Xb is capacitive.  Hence, 
the left and right series resonator in Fig. 2(c) will produce the 
low-frequency transmission zero (fa) and high-frequency (fb) 
transmission zero, respectively. Furthermore, the composite 
shunt resonator in Fig. 2(c) can be represented by a shunt 
resonator shown in Fig. 2(d), which resonates at fr [9]. 
The proposed λ/4 resonator shown in Fig. 2(a) can be 
defined as a coupled line section, which only has one feed 
port.  Consequently, based on the analysis of parallel coupled 
line circuit [10], the input admittance inY  in Fig. 2(a) is 
derived as

According to (3), when fr and C1 are chosen, the value of (Z0e, 
Z0o) can be selected arbitrarily and then the dimensions of the 
proposed λ/4 can be received. 
B. Meander-line Antenna 
In this research, an antenna which exhibits a series RLC 
resonance with high inductance is used to substitute the last 
resonator and load impedance of the filter. Since the 
meander-line antenna is a variety of a monopole antenna, the 
antenna exhibits a series RLC resonance near the first 
resonant frequency [11], which is suitable to design the 
filtering antenna. Fig. 3 (a) shows the geometry of the 
meander-line antenna and Fig. 3 (b) depicts the equivalent 
circuit at the antenna feed point looking toward the antenna. 
Here, LA and CA express the resonant inductance and 
capacitance of the antenna, respectively, and RA corresponds 
to the antenna radiation resistance.  It is noted that an extra

proposed filtering antenna provides good skirt selectivity.  
The simulated and measured antenna gain versus frequency in 
the +z direction and +x direction for the proposed filtering 
antenna are depicted in Fig. 6.  It is obvious that the responses 
of the antenna gain versus frequency also have sharp skirt 
selectivity.  Here, the measured antenna gains at operating 
frequency in the +z direction and +x direction are 1.865 dBi 
and 0.314 dBi, respectively.  Meanwhile, it can found that 
these responses shown in Fig. 6 have two transmission zeros 
near f = 2 GHz and 2.9 GHz, which are produced by the 
proposed λ/4 resonator. The measured and simulated total-
field radiation patterns at f0 = 2.45 GHz in the three principal 
planes are also presented in Fig. 7.  It is seen that the 
measured patterns have good agreement with the simulated 
ones.  The radiation pattern in the xz-plane is nearly 
omnidirectional with peak gain of 2.78 dBi. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
A filtering antenna with new structure, which is realized by 
the co-design method, has been discussed in this paper.  The 
design is accomplished by first establishing and analyzing the 
circuit models of the proposed λ/4 resonator and antenna, 
which can be employed as the first and last resonators of filter, 
respectively.  Meanwhile, the antenna is also a radiator for the 
proposed structure.  Based on the same equivalent circuit and 
specifications of the conventional second-order Chebyshev 
bandpass filter, the proposed filtering antenna has been 
designed by using the design procedures. The proposed
