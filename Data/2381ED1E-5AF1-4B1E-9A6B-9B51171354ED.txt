1. Introduction 
Titanium nitride (TiN) thin films and coatings have been widely applied ranging from hard and 
protective coatings on mechanical tools, decorative coatings, to the diffusion barrier in microelectronic 
industry, owing to their high hardness, high thermal and chemical stability, and attractive color.  Thin 
films deposited by vapor deposition, PVD or CVD, normally exhibit various degree of preferred 
orientations or textures.  Most of the vapor deposition methods usually produce fiber textures.  The 
film texture often affects its properties; for example, the hardness of TiN film was reported to increase 
with increasing (111) texture [1-3], and TiN film with (111) texture was the most wear-resistant [4]. 
To improve the adhesion strength, it is common to incorporate a Ti interlayer between the TiN film 
and the substrate material.  The Ti interlayer can also increase the corrosion resistance of the 
TiN-coated metal substrate by isolating the corrosive medium through the pin-holes in the TiN coatings 
from reaching the substrate metal [5-7].  Moreover, the addition of Ti interlayer has been 
acknowledged to be an effective way to change the texture of the TiN film.  The function of Ti 
interlayer is basically to provide a template for the growth of TiN film on top of the interlayer [8-10].  
However, the addition of an interlayer will also relieve the stress in the TiN film.  In our recent study 
[11], it is found that the change of texture is related to the strain energy in the film.  Consequently, the 
effect of interlayer on the texture of TiN film may not only relate to the local epitaxy, the change of 
residual stress may also play a role. 
In a previous study [12], using ion beam assisted deposition, we prepared TiN and TiN/Ti 
specimens with in-plane or fiber textures, and the effect of adding Ti-interlayer was investigated.  The 
Ti-interlayer has an effect to change the in-plane textured TiN film from one type to another type by 
rotating the grain orientation 45° along the <100> axis with respect to the former texture; moreover, a 
strongly (0002) textured Ti-interlayer may further align the (111) plane in TiN with the orientation of Ti 
interlayer.  For the TiN film with fiber texture, the insertion of Ti interlayer may change the texture of 
the TiN film from (002) to (111), and a strongly (0002) textured Ti interlayer is necessary to align the 
texture of the TiN film.  The effect of Ti interlayer on the change of TiN texture occurs most evidently 
in the case of loose packing or low residual stress films.  However, due to the intrinsic characteristics 
of the IBAD method, the residual stresses in the TiN films deposited by IBAD method are at a relatively 
lower range, usually less than – 2.2 GPa.  On the other hand, the TiN or ZrN thin films deposited by 
other commonly used plasma-related physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes, such as magnetron 
sputtering and ion plating, the residual stress in the films may easily reach -8 GPa and above [13,14].  
It is unclear whether the Ti-interlayer can play a similar role on the residual stress and the texture 
development of the TiN thin film at a much higher residual stress level, for example higher than -6 GPa. 
Our recent study [13] found that TiN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 140 to 244 nm 
deposited by unbalanced magnetron (UBM) sputtering may have very high compressive residual stresses, 
ranging from -8.1 to -10.2 GPa.  Therefore, UBM sputtering was chosen for the preparation of TiN thin 
films with high residual stress, and the effect of Ti-interlayer on the texture and residual stress was 
investigated on TiN and TiN/Ti specimens. Texture analysis was conducted by pole figure measurement.  
Residual stress of the TiN and TiN/Ti specimens was measured by the modified sin2ψ method.  The 
purpose of this study was to compare the effects of Ti interlayer on the texture and residual stress of the 
TiN films at high stress level, produced by UBM sputtering, and those at relatively lower stress level by 
IBAD method in the previous study [12]. 
2. Experimental Procedures 
TiN films were deposited using UBM sputtering method.  Si (100) wafers with a dimension of 
25.4 mm × 25.4 mm × 0.6 mm were used as the substrate materials, which were cleaned by successive 
rinses in ultrasonic baths of acetone and methanol and blown dried with N2 gas. 
For the UBM sputtering processing, TiN and TiN/Ti specimens were deposited using an 
unbalanced magnetron sputtering (STS-400) system.  A rectangular titanium target (99.9% in purity) 
with dimensions of 248 mm × 130 mm × 10 mm  was used.  To reduce contamination, the chamber 
was heated to 300°C during pumping.  The base pressure of the chamber was 1.20 ×10-3 Pa.   Prior to 
 6
Cross-sectional SEM images reveal microstructures of the TiN and TiN/Ti films as shown in Fig. 
2.  Figs. 2 (a) and (b) show the typical microstructure of the TiN specimen deposited by UBM 
sputtering without and with a Ti interlayer of 200nm, respectively.  The specimens exhibit a very dense 
columnar structure with a column width ranging from 50 to 100 nm.  Compared with the 
microstructure of the specimens with fiber texture deposited by IBAD, which displays looser and 
coarser columnar structure, the UBM sputtering specimen shows a much smoother surface and more 
compact structure.  From Fig. 2, it can be found that the microstructure of the TiN films is similar for 
the specimen with and without Ti interlayer.  Therefore, the addition of a Ti interlayer does not appear 
to substantially change the microstructure of the TiN film on top of the Ti layer for these UBM 
sputter-grown films.  From the SEM pictures the thickness of the TiN and Ti interlayer is measured and 
the results are listed in Table 1. 
Fig.3 shows the cross-sectional TEM images for the specimen M3 with 200 nm Ti interlayer.  As 
shown in Figs.3 (a) and (b), it can be seen that the film possesses columnar structure with a column 
width less than 50 nm, which is consistent with the results from SEM images, and both TiN and Ti 
interlayer are very dense without nanopipes between columns.  The corresponding diffraction patterns 
for TiN, Ti and TiN/Ti are shown in Figs.3 (c), (d) and (e), respectively.  Both diffraction patterns of 
TiN and Ti display ring segments, indicating that the grain sizes in those two layers are very small.  
From Fig.3 (b), the high resolution TEM image at TiN/Ti interface indicates that there is no substantial 
orientation relationship between TiN and Ti interlayer.  The diffraction pattern depicted in Fig. 3(e) 
also reveals the same evidence.  Therefore, TEM microstructure study confirms the results of pole 
figure measurements.    
 The residual stresses in TiN film and Ti interlayer were measured using the modified sin2ψ method 
[15] with a grazing incident XRD geometry.  The results and the correlation coefficients are listed in 
Table 2.  It is found that the compressive residual stresses in the TiN films are quite high in all 
specimens, ranging from 4.53 to 8.79 GPa, compared with the IBAD specimens, less than 2.2 GPa, in 
the previous study.  The residual stresses in the Ti-interlayer are much less than those in TiN films and 
in tensile state.  The extent of residual stress is found to be consistent with the film microstructure.  In 
the previous study [12], we have reported that for the specimens with residual stress lower than -1 GPa, 
the TiN films possess a looser columnar structure, and therefore the growth of the TiN grains is easier to 
be aligned with the orientation of the Ti interlayer.  In contrast, for specimens with compact 
microstructure they have higher residual stress and grains are more difficult to be aligned with the 
orientation of Ti interlayer.  This argument is further confirmed in the present study.  The specimens 
prepared by UBM sputtering, with a highly compact structure, are in a much higher stress range than 
those deposited by IBAD method, and the effect of interlayer texture becomes insignificant in the 
texture development of the TiN film.  
The effect of the Ti interlayer on the relief of residual stress is quite significant as the thickness of 
the interlayer increases by two fold.  Compared specimens M2 with M3, it is found that the residual 
stress was relieved by almost 50% when the thickness of the Ti layer was doubled.  However, the stress 
relief was not obvious for a Ti interlayer of 100 nm thick, as compared with a single-layer TiN specimen.  
Although increasing Ti interlayer thickness can lower the residual stress, its effect on texture change is 
not obvious.  Specimens M2 and M3 do not exhibit a significant texture change when the thickness of 
the Ti interlayer is doubled.  This also suggests that the relief of the residual stress is not necessarily 
accompanied by a texture change for the deposition conditions employed in this study.   
4. Conclusions 
(1) The Ti interlayer has a relatively weak effect on the texture of the TiN films by UBM sputtering, and 
increasing thickness of the Ti interlayer does not affect the texture of the TiN film. 
(2) About 50% of the residual stress in the TiN film is relieved by the Ti interlayer with a thickness of 
200 nm.

Effect of Film Thickness and Ti Interlayer on the Structure and Properties of 
Nanocrystalline TiN Thin Films on AISI D2 Steel 
 
Abstract 
Nanocrystalline TiN thin films were deposited on AISI D2 steel substrates using unbalanced 
magnetron sputtering (UBMS) method.  The objective of this study was to investigate the effect 
of TiN film thickness and Ti interlayer thickness on the N/Ti ratio, structure, mechanical 
properties and corrosion resistance of the films.  The results showed that 111 was the dominant 
preferred orientation in the TiN films, which became less distinct for the specimen with Ti 
interlayer.  Roughness and grain size of the TiN films were only slightly dependent on the film 
thickness.  The packing factor was almost constant with film thickness and even the thinnest 
TiN coating, 140 nm, reached a quite high packing factor of 0.8.  The nanohardness of the films, 
ranging from 21~26 GPa, did not show significant dependence on film thickness.  All 
specimens contained compressive residual stresses, and decreased with increasing TiN film 
thickness.  In the TiN/Ti-coated specimens, there was a critical Ti interlayer thickness, between 
120 and 150nm, at which the residual stress in the TiN films could be substantially relieved.  
The results of potentiodynamic scan in both 5% NaCl and 0.5M H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN solutions 
indicated that packing factor was more effective than film thickness on the corrosion resistance 
of the coatings.  Furthermore, increasing film thickness or adding a Ti interlayer could 
effectively protect the substrate from the corrosive medium, if the packing factor was sufficiently 
high.  The increase of interlayer thickness may also increase the corrosion resistance of the 
film.

interlayer showed enhanced preferred orientation when approaching the TiN/Ti interface.  The 
texture enhancement may be due to similar atomic packing between (111) in TiN and (0001) in 
Ti, which leads to kinetically favorable in forming TiN (111) on the pre-deposited Ti interlayer 
[24].  However, our recent studies [25] found that the texture enhancement of TiN film with Ti 
interlayer may be altered due to ion beam bombardment.      
From our previous research [26-28], TiN coatings with Ti interlayer possess higher adhesive 
strength than those without Ti interlayer.  This is attributed to the better contact at the 
substrate/Ti interface as well as the Ti/TiN interface. In addition, the interdiffusion zone 
broadened with Ti interlayer may enlarge the pseudo-diffusion layer and enhance the adhesion 
strength of TiN coatings.  Hultman et al. [29] also reported that the introduction of a Ti 
interlayer on the substrate improved adhesion property of TiN because the Ti interlayer has good 
adhesion with oxides between substrate and TiN. 
Another beneficial effect of Ti interlayer is associated with the relief of residual stress. 
Previous studies suggested that the role of Ti interlayer is to dissolve oxide layer remaining on 
the surface of substrate as well as to relieve shear stress in the interface [22,30].  Our recent 
study [25] measured the residual stresses in TiN and Ti interlayer, respectively, and confirmed 
that a Ti interlayer with 150 nm thickness can effectively relieve half of the residual stress.   
Corrosion resistance of TiN-coated steels is closely related to the thickness of the coating.  
Our previous studies [3,26-28] suggested that the corrosion properties of TiN-coated steels are 
mainly determined by the synergistic effect of packing density and film thickness.  A high 
packing density film may reduce the penetration of the corrosive medium onto the substrate 
material; in addition, when the coating becomes thicker, the likelihood of having the 
through-thickness pinholes is lowered.  Chou and his coworkers [3] found that there is a 
critical thickness of TiN thin film; as the film thickness is smaller than the critical thickness, the 
corrosion current increases abruptly. In the case of 5% NaCl solution, the critical thickness is 
about 700 nm, while in 1 N H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN, the critical thickness is about 300 nm. 
Our earlier research [3,28,31] also showed that multilayer coatings have lower pinhole rate 
than a single layer coating, because interlayer may interrupt the through-thickness defects.  
Similar results have been reported by Larsson et al. [32] and Rossi et al. [33].   Using 
multilayered structure of the type Ti/TiN/Ti/TiN, Hubler et al. [34] found a better corrosion 
protection of the steel substrate, even with a much smaller total coating thickness than using 
single-layer TiN coating.  
In addition, the effect of Ti interlayer also can favor the growth of both less defective nitride 
coatings and a titanium oxide passive barrier [35,36].  Herranen et al. [37] suggested that the 
applying of a few thick Ti interlayers can hinder columnar growth.  Hubler et al. [34, 38] found 
that the increase of Ti interlayer thickness increases the corrosion resistance. Moreover, there 
may be a minimum thickness for the Ti layer (~200nm) to achieve effective corrosion protection 
[39].  Marco et al. [40] also found that the corrosion resistance of TiN coated steel with 1 µm 
coating thickness, under salt spray test, could be significantly improved by adding a 100nm thick 
Ti interlayer. 
Although extensive investigations have been done on the influence of Ti interlayer, most of 
the research has been done for the TiN films with thickness larger than 1 µm, and grain size 
larger than 50 nm.  There is little understanding for film thickness less than 500 nm and for 
nanocrystalline TiN film.  The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of film thickness and 
the addition of Ti interlayer on the structure, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance of 
nanocrystalline TiN thin films (< 500 nm) deposited by UBMS.  AISI D2 steel was chosen as 
 18
specimen was prepared by cutting a notch on the back surface, soaking in liquid nitrogen for a 
few minutes, and fracturing the specimen.  However, due to the ductility of the steel substrate, 
the microstructure of the TiN films is not clearly revealed.  Some specimens of TiN on Si were 
also prepared at similar deposition conditions for the observation of microstructure.  The 
samples for SEM observations were prepared by cleaving the TiN deposited Si specimens.  
Since TiN is an electric conductive material, no further pretreatment was done on the specimens.  
The cross section of the specimens was examined.  Thickness of the TiN film can be also 
measured by the SEM observations. 
The N/Ti ratios and packing factors were obtained by Rutherford backscattering 
spectrometry (RBS) using RUMP simulation code.  The N/Ti ratio and packing factor were 
obtained from the RBS results.  The packing factor is defined as,  
Packing Factor =

where SAD is the simulated atomic packing density (#/cm2) from RBS, D is the density of TiN 
(g/cm3), No is Avogadro number 6.02 × 1023, t is the film thickness (cm) which is obtained from 
cross-sectional SEM image, and A is the molecular weight of TiN (g/mol).  Secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy (SIMS) was used to determine the compositional depth profiles of the TiN film.  
From the SIMS depth profiles, the uniformity of each composition can be obtained, and Ti, N 
and Fe profiles were also used to confirm the TiN film or Ti interlayer thicknesses on steel.   
The residual stresses of the TiN films were determined using the modified XRD sin2ψ  
method [19].  The Cu Kα line at 0.15418 nm was used as the source for diffraction.  X-ray 
was incident at a grazing angle of 2° to increase the diffraction volume of the thin film specimen.  
For the TiN films, (220) peak was used for the residual stress measurement because it provided 
sufficient intensity for precise determination of the peak position.  
To avoid the substrate effect, hardness of the TiN film was measured using nanoindentation 
with a Berkovich diamond indenter head.  The testing load was carefully selected to meet the 
requirement that the contact depth should be about one-tenth of film thickness.  The applying 
loads were ranged from 1000 to 8300 µN, depending on the film thickness.  The load was first 
increased to the desired value in 5 seconds, held constant for 5 seconds, and then unloaded in 5 
seconds.  A standard quartz sample was used to calibrate the nanoindenter and the accuracy of 
the hardness was within 10 %.  For each sample, ten measurements were performed and the 
average value was reported.  The precision of each value was within 10 %.  The surface 
roughness of the TiN film was determined by an atomic force microscope (AFM). 
The corrosion resistance of the TiN-coated stainless specimens was evaluated by both 
potentiodynamic scans and salt spray tests.  The potentiodynamic scan was carried out using an 
EG&G Potentiostat / Galvanostat model M263A.  The potentiodynamic polarization tests were 
carried out in 5% NaCl and 1N H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN solutions, respectively.  A metal wire 
was spot-welded onto the uncoated side of the specimen.  Then, the specimen was 
cold-mounted with epoxy and left a 1cm × 1cm of TiN coating area exposed to the corrosive 
media.  The specimen was immersed in the electrolyte, where nitrogen gas was bubbled at least 
30 minutes to deaerate the oxygen in the solution.  The polarization scans were conducted 
from –1600mV (vs. SCE) to 200 mV and –1050 mV (vs. SCE) to 800 mV, for 5% NaCl and 1N 
H2SO4 +0.05M KSCN, respectively, at a speed of 0.5 mV/s. After each potentiodynamic 
polarization scan, the corrosion potential, Ecorr, and the corrosion current density, Icorr, can be 
determined by Tafel polarization plot [43].  The salt spray test was performed for 500 hours 
 20
displays the typical surface morphology for the TiN/D2 specimens.  The surface roughness of 
the TiN films was evaluated with the software equipped with the AFM.  All the root mean 
square values of roughness (Rrms) are listed in Tables 1.  The Rrms of bare D2 steel is 3.9 nm.  
As shown in Fig. 5, the roughness of TiN on D2 steel specimens slightly increases with 
increasing film thickness. 
The nanohardness of TiN and TiN/Ti on D2 steel substrate is listed in Table 1.  The results 
show that the hardness of the TiN films ranges from 22.8 to 26.2 GPa.  Since the substrate 
effect may be significant for the film thickness less than 150 nm [45], the experimental errors for 
specimen F1 could be more than 15%.  In addition, it can be found that the hardness of TiN/Ti 
specimens F4 and F5 is lower than that of the corresponding single-layered specimen F1, which 
may be due to the substrate effect from the interlayer.  The nanohardness with respect to the 
film thickness is shown in Fig. 6.  Considering the influence of substrate effect and the 
uncertainty of the measurement, nanohardness of the film is not significantly varied with the film 
thickness. 
Fig. 7 shows the variation of residual stress of the TiN films with film thickness.  All 
specimens possess compressive residual stress, and the residual stress decreases with increasing 
film thickness for the single-layered specimens, which is consistent with the results reported in 
our previous study [2].    
Fig. 8 shows potentiodynamic polarization scan curves for bare D2 steel, Ti/D2, and all 
F-series specimens in 0.5M H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN solution.  From the curves, the corrosion 
potential (Ecorr ) and corrosion current density (Icorr ) can be determined using Tafel plot method. 
Table 2 lists the Ecorr  and Icorr values for all specimens.  The Icorr with respect to the film 
thickness is shown in Fig. 9.  Apparently, the corrosion resistance of the TiN film is affected by 
the film thickness.  As the film thickness increases, the Icorr decreases, except for specimen F3.  
Compared the Icorr values of single-layered specimens with those of TiN/Ti specimens, it can be 
found that Icorr substantially decreases as the thickness of Ti interlayer increases.  Fig. 10 shows 
the results of potentiodynamic polarization scan for all specimens in 5% NaCl solution.  Similar 
to those tested in 0.5M H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN solution, the variation of Ecorr values is only 
deviated slightly from that of bare D2 steel.  Fig. 11 depicts the corrosion current density in 5% 
NaCl solution with respect to the film thickness.  The results show similar trend as that in 0.5N 
H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN solution.  The corrosion area percentage of the Ti/D2, TiN/D2 and 
TiN/Ti/D2 samples after 500-hr salt spray test with respect to the film thickness is shown in Fig. 
12.  It can be seen that corrosion area decreases with increasing film thickness, and samples 
with Ti interlayer have smaller corrosion area. 
4. Discussion 
From the experimental results, the structure, mechanical properties (nanohardness and 
residual stress) and corrosion resistance of the TiN films show interesting dependence with film 
and interlayer thickness.  In this section, these properties will be further discussed for better 
understanding of the relationship between structure and properties. 
The XRD results in Fig. 3 indicate that the increase of film thickness may increase the 
crystallinity of the single-layered specimens; however, for the specimens adding a Ti interlayer, 
F4 and F5, the (111) preferred orientation decreases compared with the specimen F1 that has the 
same TiN thickness.  This behavior is opposite to our previous study [23], where (111) texture 
of the TiN films deposited by hollow cathode discharge ion plating (HCD-IP) is enhanced by 
adding a Ti interlayer.  On the other hand, in a recent research [46], using cross-sectional 
transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and XRD pole figure measurement, we have found 
 22
[16,56], the higher crystallinity implies fewer lattice defects and thereby decreasing compressive 
residual stress in the TiN films. 
As mentioned earlier, Ti interlayer can not only dissolve oxide layer on the substrate surface 
but also relieve shear stress in the interface [22,30].  The experimental results reveal that the 
residual stress is substantially relieved as the Ti interlayer thickness increases from 120 nm to 
150 nm, the corresponding relief of stress is from 6.5% to 33 %.  This indicates that there is a 
critical Ti interlayer thickness between 120 and 150 nm for effectively relieving residual stress. 
From Table 2, the corrosion potentials (Ecorr) of the coated specimens in the two solutions 
are only slightly away from that of D2 steel, within 25 mV, which indicates that the corrosion of 
the TiN and TiN/Ti coated-specimens are mainly from the dissolution of the metal substrate and 
not from the TiN film.  Since Ecorr is a thermodynamic property of the substrate material, the 
variation of Ecorr is not supposed to be far away from that of bare D2 steel.  It can be found, 
from Table 2, that the TiN- and TiN/Ti-coatings drastically lower the corrosion current densities 
(Icorr) of the specimens, about one order of magnitude, compared with the uncoated specimens.      
The potentiodynamic scanning tests in the two solutions display the same trend, as shown in 
Figs. 9 and 11.  The single layer Ti/D2 specimen has higher Icorr than TiN or TiN/Ti-coated 
specimens.  However, compared with bare D2 steel, the Icorr of Ti/D2 specimen lowers 90 % 
and 80 % in 0.5M H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN and 5% NaCl solutions, respectively.  In other words, 
although D2 with Ti coating shows higher Icorr than with TiN coating, it still possesses very good 
corrosion resistance.  The results also depict that a thinner TiN coating (140 nm) exhibits better 
corrosion resistance than thicker Ti coating (200 nm).  Evidently, the TiN coating provides 
better improvement in corrosion resistance compared with pure Ti coating.     
From Figs. 9 and 11, it can be found that the Icorr decreases with increasing film thickness, 
except specimen F3 with the thickest TiN coating.  According to our previous research [28], 
film thickness and packing factor are the two major factors which should be considered for 
corrosion protection coatings.  As the TiN film grows thicker, there is less likelihood for the 
film to have through-thickness pinholes interconnecting with one another, and consequently, it 
becomes more difficult for the corrosive medium to penetrate or diffuse through the film onto the 
metal substrate.  The packing factor represents the denseness of the film, which is primarily 
related to the number density of pinhole in the film, and the higher packing factor implies the 
film containing smaller amount of pinholes.  However, the relative importance of film thickness 
and packing factor cannot be clarified in our earlier studies due to the difficulty of separating the 
two factors.  The experimental results in the present study may provide some information on 
this issue.  From Table 1, the packing factor of TiN thin films reaches a quite high value of 0.8 
and is almost constant with film thickness, except specimen F3.  Specimen F3 shows higher Icorr 
in the two solutions than specimen F2 which possesses a smaller thickness and higher packing 
density.  Moreover, specimen F1, with higher packing factor but less than one third of the 
thickness of specimen F3, has the same Icorr in NaCl solution as that of specimen F3.  This 
suggests that if the packing factor is sufficiently high, a TiN film with smaller thickness would 
have enough corrosion resistance in the aggressive environment.  Thus it can be concluded that 
packing factor is more important than the film thickness to the corrosion resistance for the 
ultra-thin coating, less than 500 nm.  
The effect of Ti interlayer is worth noting.  Comparing the Icorr values in Table 2, one finds 
that the specimens with Ti interlayer, in most cases, exhibit better corrosion resistance than those 
without the interlayer.  Similar results have been reported for ZrN-coated AISI 304 stainless 
 24
5. Conclusions 
(1) Nanocrystalline TiN thin films were deposited on AISI D2 steel substrates using unbalanced 
magnetron sputtering (UBMS) method.  (111) is the dominant preferred orientation in the 
single-layer TiN films, which becomes less distinct for the specimen with Ti interlayer.   
(2) Roughness and grain size of the TiN films are only slightly dependent on the film thickness. 
(3) The hardness of the TiN films ranges from 21.2 to 26.2GPa, and film thickness has no 
obvious effect on the hardness, which may be due to the deformation mechanism switching 
to grain boundary-mediated deformation instead of slip by dislocation. 
(4) The residual stresses of all specimens are compressive and decrease with increasing coating 
thickness.  There is a critical Ti interlayer thickness between 120 and 150nm, at which the 
residual stress in the TiN coating can be substantially relieved. 
(5) The results of potentiodynamic scan in both 5% NaCl and 0.5M H2SO4 + 0.05M KSCN 
solutions indicate that packing factor is more effective than film thickness on the corrosion 
resistance of the coatings. 
(6) Increasing film thickness or adding a Ti interlayer could enhance the protection the substrate 
from the corrosive medium, if the packing factor of the film is sufficiently high.  The 
increase of interlayer thickness may also increase the corrosion resistance of the film.
