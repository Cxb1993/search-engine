1. Introduction 
In recent years, run-to-run (R2R) con-
trol has been extensively applied in the 
process adjustment practice. It integrates 
two well-known process control methods, 
statistical process control (SPC) and engi-
neering process control (EPC), and can cre-
ate more effective control tools for process 
variation reduction. An R2R feedback con-
trol algorithm called the exponentially 
weighted moving average (EWMA) con-
troller is very popular in the semiconductor 
manufacturing community, particularly on 
the applications of the chemical mechanical 
polishing (CMP) process. An important 
process issue occurring frequently in semi-
conductor manufacturing is that the equip-
ment ages and the tool wears with time. The 
double exponentially weighted moving av-
erage (dEWMA) control, proposed by But-
ler and Stefani [2], comes into play in this 
situation. The performance of the dEWMA 
control depends primarily on the adequacy 
of two weight parameters, pointing out that 
incorrectly choosing the weight will have an 
adverse effect on the process control output. 
Due to the time-varying property in a real 
manufacturing environment, how to achieve 
a more stable control performance for the 
dynamic system by means of developing an 
on-line tuning method for the dEWMA- 
based control will be addressed in this pa-
per. 
In a vast majority of on-line quality 
control applications, there always exist mul-
tiple quality characteristics of interest to the 
process engineer. For the recent literature of 
multivariate single EWMA control, Tseng et 
al. [9] have developed a multiple-input mul-
tiple-output (MIMO) extension of a single 
EWMA controller and derived the stability 
conditions of their controller and the feasi-
ble region of its associated discounting fac-
tors. Meanwhile, del Castillo and Rajagopal 
[3] proposed a multivariate dEWMA con-
troller for squared multiple-input, multi-
ple-output (MIMO) processes, where there 
is an equal number of inputs and outputs, 
and the stability condition of the closed-loop 
system was shown to be invariant with re-
spect to three practical drifting disturbances; 
i.e., a multivariate Deterministic Trend (DT), 
a multivariate Random Walk with Drift 
(RWD), and a multivariate IMA(1,1) time 
series process. Recommendations on how to 
choose the multivariate double EWMA 
weight matrices were given, together with 
the investigation of the effect of changing 
the EWMA weights. An analysis was also 
conducted to assess the impact of errors in 
the estimates of the process gains. Later, 
Rajagopal and del Castillo [6] extended the 
previous multivariate dEWMA controller 
for the non-squared system. They intro-
duced two different multivariate dEWMA 
controllers for the case of non-squared sys-
tems, where the number of process inputs is 
not necessarily equal to that of process out-
puts. Note that most industrial processes in 
practice are not squared.  
The behavior of the process control 
output under the EWMA-based control re-
lies mainly on the setting of weight matrices. 
Most relevant research, thus far, has focused 
on analyzing the optimal EWMA weights 
under the “static” condition. Several previ-
 4
based upon the neural network technique 
being suggested to tune adaptively the 
weight parameters of the multivariate 
dEWMA controller for MIMO non-squared 
processes. The central core is to integrate 
the neural network and time series modeling 
techniques where the sample autocorrelation 
function (SACF) and sample partial auto-
correlation function (SPACF) patterns are 
utilized as the input features of the proposed 
neural network to estimate the weights of 
the multivariate dEWMA controller. The 
fundamental components of the proposed 
adaptive on-line tuning system are intro-
duced in the following.  
 
2.1. Non-squared MIMO Model Descrip-
tion 
The present study is to cope with the 
R2R control of non-squared MIMO systems; 
that is, processes where the number of con-
trollable factors exceeds the number of re-
sponse variables. It is assumed that the 
process model consists of p responses (or 
outputs) and m controllable factors (or in-
puts). Most of the research outcomes ad-
dressed herein are for those instances where 
m > p. For more details, interested readers 
can refer to Rajagopal and del Castillo [6]. 
The assumed process model can be ex-
pressed as  
1t t t−= + +y U Nα β ,                 (1) 
where ty  is a 1p ×  vector of the measured 
quality characteristics or responses observed 
at time instance t, 1t−U  is an 1m×  vector 
of levels of the controllable factors set at the 
end of run ( 1)t − . The vector α  contains 
the process offsets of the p responses and 
the p m×  matrix β  contains the in-
put-output gains. tN  stands for the distur-
bance vector. In case of t tt= +N δ ε , it is 
assumed a multivariate deterministic trend, 
where δ  is a diagonal matrix containing 
the average drift per run for each of the re-
sponses, and tε  is a multivariate white 
noise sequence. Namely, ~ ( , )t N 0 Σε , where

for i j≠  and iiσ  denotes the variance of 
iε . 
 
2.2. Multivariate dEWMA Controller  
For the non-squared process, one of the 
modified multivariate dEWMA controller, 
dubbed the ridge-solution controller, is pro-
posed by Rajagopal and del Castillo [6]. The 
concept behind the ridge-solution controller 
is to minimize 2[ ]t −E y T  subject to the 
norm constraint ( ) 2ρ′ <U U , where ρ  is 
the radius that confines the values of con-
trollable factors to be taken. It is similar to 
the optimization methods used in ridge 
analysis arising from response surface 
methodology (RSM). If μ  is deemed the 
Lagrange multiplier of the inequality con-
straint, thus the control equation obtained is 
of the form as below:  
1( ) ( )t t tμ −′ ′= + − −U B B I B T A D ,      (2) 
where B  is the estimate of the parameter 
 6
the SACF and the SPACF. The output unit is 
an estimate of the weight matrix in the mul-
tivariate dEWMA controller corresponding 
to a particular combination of SACF and 
SPACF at run t. The theoretical ACF at lag h 
is defined as below:

3. dMEWMA-NN Controller 
The structure of the proposed adaptive 
neural-network-based, multivariate dEWMA 
(dMEWMA-NN) controller is shown in 
Figure 1. The objective is to estimate the 
multivariate dEWMA controller’s weights 
adaptively through pattern recognition on 
the SACF and SPACF patterns. At first, the 
quality characteristic ( 'sty ) under control 
was sent to the SACF and SPACF block to 
compute the sample statistics individually. 
The combined SACF/SPACF pattern was 
then delivered to the trained NN model 
block to estimate the controller’s weight 
parameters for the execution of next run. 
After estimating the weight parameters, the 
updated parameters in the weight matrices 
are provided on-line to the multivariate 
dEWMA controller from run to run, expect-
ing to achieve a better control performance 
than the ordinary multivariate dEWMA 
controller with fixed weights. 
 
3.1. Off-line Training of Neural Network 
The training data sets were generated 
by simulating different combinations of the 
disturbance models and controller parame-
ters (i.e., discounting factors in the weight 
matrices). There were totally 256 data sets 
collected by simulating 256 times subject to 
the condition 1 2,  [0, 1]λ λ ∈ , which implied 
that there were 256 SACF/SPACF sample 
patterns. The training data produced NN 
rules of the proposed adaptive multivariate 
dEWMA controller, as shown in Figure 2. A 
useful guide was provided by Box and Jen-
kins [1], who suggested that the size of time 
series horizon (t) be at least 50 and lags (h) 
to analyze the series at most t/4. Thus, 50 
runs were simulated for response data buffer 
at each independent simulation, and 12 lags 
in each SACF and SPCAF pattern were 
taken. The NN weight estimator was trained, 
using the Levenburg Marquardt algorithm, 
to learn the mapping from the SACF and 
SPCAF patterns to the multivariate dEWMA 
weight combination data. For convergence, 
 8
outputs were obtained by using the proposed 
dMEWMA-NN controller and the corre-
sponding control performance was com-
pared to the original ridge-solution control-
ler posed in Rajagopal and del Castillo [6] 
with fixed weight parameters of 1 (0.15)=Λ I  
and 2 (0.35)=Λ I .  
 
4.1. dMEWMA-NN Control Perform-
ance in 4 2×  linear CMP Process 
under Multivariate White Noise Dis-
turbance with Deterministic Trend 
Model 
The NN weight estimator trained 
off-line was implemented on-line to tune the 
weights of the dMEWMA-NN controller in 
the 4 2×  linear CMP process under the 
multivariate white noise disturbances, 
[ ] 21 2 260 0 ~ ( , ), where 0 30Nε ε ′= =
⎡ ⎤⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦0 Σ Σε  in equations (12-13) with a deterministic trend 
model. The simulation results of 5000 runs 
are given in Figure 4, where the 
dMEWMA-NN with ridge-solution control-
ler is operated to control the 4 2×  nonlin-
ear CMP process. The means and standard 
deviations of both responses over 5000 runs 
were obtained as [ 1y , 2y ]= [2000.24, 
100.223] and [
1y
S , 
2y
S ]= [69.535, 34.7693]. 
Figure 5 plots the weights 1λ  and 2λ  of 
dMEWMA-NN controller throughout 5000 
runs. Table 1 shows the simulation results of 
the performance measures iy , iyS , and iU  
generated by using the dMEWMA-NN with 
ridge-solution controller. The performance 
measured in the average control output ( iy ) 
of response and standard deviation (
iy
S ) of 
control output indicated that the process 
outputs controlled by the dMEWMA-NN 
controller was accurately on target, and had 
smaller standard deviations on both re-
sponses (see the statistics 
1y
S  and 
2y
S ) than 
the Rajagopal and del Castillo’s [6] method 
with fixed weight parameters. In this situa-
tion, the proposed dMEWMA-NN controller 
demonstrated quite competitive control per-
formance. 
 
4.2. dMEWMA-NN Control Performance 
in 4 2×  linear CMP Process under 
IMA (1,1) Disturbance with Deter-
ministic Trend Model 
In this section, initial models (14) and 
(15) were again provided with the 
dMEWMA-NN controller to start the simu-
lation. An IMA(1,1) disturbance model was 
considered in this scenario. The multivariate 
IMA(1,1) disturbance 1, 2,( , )t tη η  for the two 
responses obeys the equation:
