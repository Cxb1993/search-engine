2. Introduction and Purpose 
Corrective reaction time is an important 
component in the research of hand-control 
movements.  Due to the feature of psycho-
logical refractory period (Welford, 1952), 
the help of the visual feedback on movement 
accuracy is intermittent, instead of conti-
nuous.  Hence, a hand-control movement, 
such as pointing a fingertip to click a button 
shown on a touch screen, might be consist of 
more than one ballistic movements to sub-
sequently correct remand distances between 
the fingertip and the button.  The shortest 
time between the onsets of two ballistic 
movements is called the “corrective reaction 
time” during which our brain receives visual 
feedback, programs a movement impulse, 
and sends the impulse to the controlled 
limbs.  To disclosure the details of our 
motor control system and to predict the 
speed-accuracy tradeoff relationships while 
performing hand-control movements, it is 
necessary to measure the corrective reaction 
time effectively and to study individual dif-
ferences. 
Early findings on corrective reaction 
time come mainly from the studies of aim-
ing movement.  Woodworth’s (1899) pio-
neer work showed that aiming movements 
made at a rate of 140 times/minute or great-
er were equally accurate no matter the visual 
feedback of ongoing movements was avail-
able or not.  This led him to conclude that 
the time required to process visual feedback 
for movement control is about 450 millise-
conds.  This finding was further supported 
by Vince (1948) who replicated Wood-
worth’s experiments.  However, Keele & 
Posner (1968) argued that the 450 millise-
conds as the corrective reaction time was 
overestimated.  The reason was because 
that the experimental tasks conducted by 
Woodworth (1899) and Vince (1948) were 
reciprocal movements in which the meas-
ured time included the time spent on revers-
ing the movement direction after targets 
were reached.  To solve the issue, instead 
of reciprocal movements, Keele & Posner 
(1968) utilized discrete aiming movements 
as their experimental tasks and found out 
that the time required for visual feedback 
loop to operate was somewhere between 190 
and 260 milliseconds.  Later, Beggs & 
Howarth (1970) utilized a different experi-
mental paradigm and obtained a result close 
to Keele & Posner’s (1968).  Their partici-
pants performed sagittal aiming movements 
that started from a position 10 cm above 
their shoulder and ended at a cross target 
vertically attached on a wall placed in from 
of them.  When they performed the move-
ments, the initial part of the movement tra-
jectory was illuminated, but the room lights 
were extinguished according to certain dis-
tances as the pen approached the target.  
Their results showed that movement accu-
racy was not improved once the available of 
visual information was shorter than 290 mil-
liseconds before the target was reached.  
All the experimental methods mentioned 
above estimated corrective reaction time by 
statistically comparing the effects of visual 
feedback on movement accuracy.  Al-
though the methods were rough and the in-
dividual differences were ignored, they gave 
an approximate range from 190 to 290 mil-
liseconds of corrective reaction time. 
Beside the studies related to aiming 
movements, Drury’s (1994) intermittent il-
lumination model has theoretical support 
and can also predict corrective reaction time.  
In the experiment by Tsao & Drury (1975), 
the participants were asked to draw lines 
within circular courses as fast as they could 
but keeping accurate.  When they per-
formed the drawing tasks, the room lights 
were manipulated to provide certain inter-
mittent illuminations comprising different 
periods of dark and light.  To model the 
effect of intermittent illuminations on 
movement speeds, Drury (1994) integrated 
the models by Drury (1971) and Howarth, 
Beggs, and Bowden (1971) and then theo-
retically developed the intermittent illumi-
nation model (Equation 1).

needed to draw three continuous circles in 
clockwise direction.  They were asked to 
draw as quickly as possible, but without 
moving outside the courses.  If the cursor 
was moved outside the courses, that move-
ment was considered as a failure trial.  
They had to repeat that course until it was 
successfully completed.  To let the partici-
pants familiar with the tasks and to optimal-
ly utilize the intermittent visual feedback, 
they had totally six to ten hours practice be-
fore formal measurements in a week.  Be-
fore each formal measurement, they per-
formed a five-trial training section to 
process dark adaptation and to be familiar 
with the tasks.

Experimental Variables 
The independent variables were: course 
width and expected delay.  The four values 
of course width were 30、35、40 and 45 
pixels 1 (pixels ؆ 0.266 mm).  The five 
values of expected delay with their combi-
nations of light and dark durations deter-
mined by Equation 1 are listed in Table 1.  
The experimental combinations in this expe-
riment were replicated twice, resulting in a 
total of 40 trials.  All the trials were ran-
domly conducted by each participant, taking 
about an hour to complete.  Each partici-
pant needed to complete eight formal mea-
surements arranged in a couple of weeks.   
The only dependent variable was speed.  
In a three-circle tracking movements, speed 
was measured per quarter circle.  To ensure 
measured movements with consistent speeds, 
the movements of the first circle and the last 
quarter circle movements were not measured.  
Hence, seven speed values were measured in 
a three-circle trial.

4. Results 
Analysis of Variance 
Analysis of variance was performed on 
the speeds, using a mixed model with Width 
and Expected Delay as fixed effects and 
Participants as random.  To ensure that the 
measured data could be further utilized with 
the intermittent illumination model, only 
main effects were analyzed.  There were 
significant main effects of Width (ܨଷ,ଵଷସଶ଻ ൌ
2596.03 , ݌ ൏ 0.001 ), Expected Delay 
(ܨସ,ଵଷସଶ଻ ൌ 8522.90, ݌ ൏ 0.001), and Par-
ticipant (ܨହ,ଵଷସଶ଻ ൌ 1010.07 , ݌ ൏ 0.001 ).  
The effects of Width and Expected Delay on 
the speeds are shown in Figure 2.  These 
main effects and Figure 2 show that (1) the 
increase of Width resulted in increase speed, 
(2) speed decreased as Expected Delay in-
creased, and (3) the participants performed 
the movement at different speeds.

reaction times.  Values represents the mean wth 95 
% conference interval.  Two reference lines 
represent the approximate range of corrective 
reaction time reported in the literature. 
5. Discussion 
First, as predicted by Drury’s (1971) and 
Drury’s (1994) two models, increased 
course width and decreased expected delay 
value result in increased movement speed.  
As shown in Figure 1, movement speeds 
measured under different expected delay 
values increases gradually according to the 
increase of course width.  Moreover, 
movement speeds measured under different 
course widths decreases linearly according 
to the increase of expected delay.  Howev-
er, the decrease rate is more intense when 
the expected delay value increases from 0 to 
0.15 s compared to other changes.  This 
explains that the participants felt more con-
fidence if there is no visual delay. 
Second, the fit of the intermittent illu-
mination model to the measured data is ex-
cellent.  As shown in Table 2, the model 
accounts for 99.4 % variance of the overall 
measurements.  For individual’s eight 
measurements, the model accounts for 98.6 
% of the variance in average and at least 
accounts for 97.2 % of the variance.  Re-
garding to individual measurements, the 
model accounts for 96.9 % of the variance in 
average and accounts for at least 89.6 % of 
the variance.   
Third, the obtained range of corrective 
reaction time is wider than that reported in 
the literature.  As shown in Table 2, the 
calculated corrective reaction time for over-
all participants is 273 milliseconds.  It 
ranges from 170 to 460 milliseconds for in-
dividual participants if every participant’s 
eight measurements are analyzed together.  
Further, it ranges from 109 to 537 millise-
conds for individual measurements.  The 
measured range of corrective reaction time 
overlaps the approximate range reported in 
the literature (Beggs and Howarth, 1970; 
Drury, 1994; Keele and Posner, 1968).  
Since this study attempted to measure indi-
vidual differences, instead of overall values 
measured from several participants, the 
measured results might be still valid. 
Finally, when individual differences of 
corrective reaction time were compared, as 
shown in Figure 4, it is clear that individual 
differences exist.  Future research of indi-
vidual differences will be focused. 
6. Conclusion 
To effectively measure individuals’ cor-
rective reaction times, this study was anoth-
er test of applying Drury’s (1994) intermit-
tent illumination model.  To deal with the 
two issues mentioned by Lin & Drury 
(2010), this study utilized a modified LED 
monitor and tested with different combina-
tions of dark periods and light periods to 
generate the expected delay values of the 
model.  The results measured from six par-
ticipants showed that the model fits the rela-
tionship between the reciprocal controllabil-
ity and the expected delay very well.  Fur-
thermore, a mean 273 milliseconds correc-
tive reaction time was obtained for overall 
participants.  We found individual differ-
ences in corrective reaction time and it 
ranges from 170 to 460 milliseconds for in-
dividuals.  Although the measured range of 
corrective reaction time is wider than that 
reported in the literature, we considered that 
the results are more convinced.  Future re-
search will be focused on studying individu-
al differences.
