Abstract
Greenhouse effect has become a crucial environmental issue due to the global warming phenomena
around the world. Searching for separation and recovery methodology is one of the key components
to solve this long-term problem. The objective of this research was to separate greenhouse gases
(CO2 and SF6) from N2 using poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) membranes containing nanoparticles
(fumed silica, Y or ZSM zeolite). The effect of operating conditions (upstream pressure, type of
nano-additive, and nanoparticle content) on the gas permeabilities and selectivities was elucidated.
Modeling of the gas separation performance was carried out using the modified Maxwell equation
on the nanocomposites containing 0-30% ZSM. The modified Maxwell equation exhibited higher
prediction power after taking into account the polymer chain rigidification and zeolite pore
blockage effects. The estimated data were in excellent agreement with the experimental results.

1. Introduction
Greenhouse effect has become a crucial environmental issue due to the global warming
phenomena all over the world. Many countries have adopted proposals for regulation to reduce
emissions of greenhouse gases. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
identified the emission of following gases to be regulated: methane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Searching
for separation and recovery methodology is one of the key components to solve this long-term
problem.
This research focuses on the greenhouse gas separation from nitrogen using membrane
technology. The SF6/N2 and CO2/N2 gas pairs were used as model gases. The pristine
poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) membrane and the nanocomposite containing fumed-silica or
zeolite were studied as the separation materials. The permeability and separation efficiency
(selectivity) were investigated as a function of various pressure differences between upstream and

zeolite membrane using Maxwell equation:

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Membrane properties
The thermal stability of the membranes was measured as the weight change as a function of
temperature using a TGA, shown in Fig. 1. The fumed silica was very stable. It only lost 10%
weight at ca. 800C. In contrast, PDMS lost 45% weight at that temperature. The weight loss of
the composite was between those of PDMS and fumed silica at 900C.

Gas separation performance at the same additive volume fraction depended on the nature of
additive and gas, as well as the upstream pressure exerted on the nanocomposite. For example, at
lower pressure drop (1 atm), N2 permeability in composite was similar to that in PDMS (Figs. 4,
6-7). SF6 permeability increased in the order: FS-PDMSZSM-PDMSY-PDMSPDMS (Figs.
4, 6-7). CO2 permeability increased in the order: FS-PDMSY-PDMSPDMSZSM-PDMS
(figs. 4, 6-7). At higher pressure drop (6 atm), N2 permeability in composite was greater than that
in PDMS. SF6 permeability increased in the order: Y-PDMS≒PDMSZSM-PDMSFS-PDMS.
CO2 permeability increased in the order: Y-PDMSFS-PDMS≒ PDMSZSM-PDMS (Figs. 4,
8-9). The selectivity for SF6/N2 or CO2/N2 gas pair varied accordingly (Figs. 4, 8-9). The effect of
additive nanoparticles is complex. They may change the polymer chain mobility, create tortuous
path for gas diffusion, impact the polymer free volume, and help resistance of membrane
compaction. The zeolite also serves as molecular differentiator and add more complicated factor
to the overall permeability and selectivity performance.
