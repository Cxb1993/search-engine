一、中文摘要
在過去，數位文件的影像通常是由掃描器
掃描所得，因為掃描器的光源與文件所放置之
位置為固定，所以所得到的數位文件影像之亮
度是很均勻的。但隨著可攜式或可移動設備的
流行，如數位照相機機、個人數位助理、智慧
型手機、與智慧型機器人等等，這些可攜式或
可移動的設備可以加上光學文字辨識系統，使
其具有文字翻譯的可攜式設備或看的懂文字
的智慧型機器人。然而，這些透過可攜式或可
移動的設備所取得的文件影像通常是有缺陷
的，這些有缺陷的文件影像通常含有陰影、過
亮、過暗、或雜訊等等，對於這類型的影像，
過去的演算法通常無法產生一張乾淨的二值
化影像，而導致 OCR階段的辨識錯誤。本研
究計畫提出一個含有兩個門檻值之二值化演
算法。經由一些實驗證明，所提出之演算法是
可以得到較佳的二值化影像圖。

Abstract
Optical character recognition occupies a
very important field in digital image processing.
It is used extensively in daily life. If the given
image does not have a bimodal intensity
histogram, it will cause segmenting mistake
easily for the previous algorithms of image
binarization. In order to solve this problem, a
new algorithm is proposed in this project. The
proposed algorithm uses the theory of moving
average on the histogram of the fuzzy image,
and then derives the better histogram. Since use
only one thresholding value cannot solve this
problem completely, the edge information and
the window processing are introduced in this
project for advanced thresholding. Thus, a more
refine bi-level image is derived and it will result
in the improvement of optical character
recognition. Experiments are carried out for
some samples with shading to demonstrate the
computational advantage of the proposed
method
Keywords: image binarization, optical character
recognition, document image, image processing,
thresholding
二、緣由與目的
It is important in image processing to select
a better threshold value automatically without
requiring from the user to adjust a set of
parameters each time when it is applied. The
threshold value often extracts objects from an
3thresholding methods that are used for the
comparison and evaluation with our approach in
this project. Otsu’s method [2] is a global
thresholding technique to divide the histogram
by selecting the threshold value to maximize the
variance between the divided regions when the
histogram of the two fixed points are divided
with a threshold value as a standard In
Bernsen’s method [10], the threshold
2/)(),( highlow ZZyxT 
is used for each pixel (x, y) , where lowZ and
highZ are the lowest and highest gray levels in a
square r×r neighborhood centered at (x, y). If
the value lowhigh ZZ  is less than another
threshold l, the pixel (x, y) is set to background.
Trier and Taxt [3] recommend r = 15 and l = 15.
The idea of Niblack’s method [4] is to vary
the threshold over the image, based on the local
mean and local standard deviation. The
threshold T(x, y) at pixel (x, y) is calculated as
),,(),(),( yxskyxmyxT 
where m(x, y) and s(x, y) are the sample mean,
and standard deviation values, respectively, in a
local neighborhood of (x, y). The size of the
neighborhood should be small enough to
preserve local details, but at the same time large
enough to suppress noise. Trier and Jain [3]
recommend to take 15×15 neighborhood and the
constant k = -0.2.
Sauvola and Pietikainen [11] propose a
method that solves this problem by adding a
hypothesis on the gray values of text and
background pixels, which results in the
following formula for the threshold:
))/),(1(1(),(),( RyxskyxmyxT 
where R is the dynamics of the standard
deviation fixed to 128 and k takes on positive
values (usually set to 0.5). This method gives
better results for document images.
The original images used in this project are
taken from textbook newsproject, and magazine
by the smart-phone with 640×480 resolution.
Let f(x, y) be the original image, where x and y
represent the coordinate values of each pixel in
this image and their ranges are from 0 to 639
and from 0 to 479, respectively. In order to
separate the text from the background, it is very
important to select an optimal threshold T of
gray-level. The pixel with gray-level less than or
equal to T is called the character point. Pixels
having a gray level lower than the threshold
value T are labeled as character (black, i.e., 0
gray-level), otherwise background (whiter, i.e.,
255 gray-level). Thus, the bi-level image g(x, y)
can be derived from

A popular technique for analyzing both the
overall stock market and individual stock is the
theory of moving average [8] of prices, which is
used to detect both the direction and the rate of
change. Some number of days of closing prices
is chosen for the calculation of a moving
average. After initially calculating the average
price, the new value for the moving average is
calculated by dropping the earliest observation
and adding the latest one. This process is
repeated daily or weekly. The resulting moving
average line supposedly represents the basic
trend of stock prices. Let r be the graylevel of an
image and let rn be the number of pixel for
gray-level r. Then the original histogram h(r) of
this image can be expressed as
.)( rnrh 
When the shape of the original histogram
does not contain only one valley, the traditional
thresholding methods will derive a not

Fig. 2 shows an original image for testing and

recognition rate RR is plotted in Fig. 3, versus
the different values of gradient f , such as 15,
30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 105. Since the value 45
of the gradient f can derive the best
recognition rate RR, we use this value in the
proposed algorithm.

The proposed bi-level thresholding
algorithm can be summarized as follows.
Algorithm：Bi-level-Thresholding
Input：Original image f(x, y)
Output：Bi-level image g(x, y)
Step 1. Get h(r) and s(x, y) from an original image
f(x, y).
Step 2. Call the procedure
Moving-Average-Histogram(h(r), )(* rh )
and derive the new histogram )(* rh .
Step 3. Use the general global bi-level algorithm,
such as Otsu’s algorithm, on the new 
histogram )(* rh to find new thresholding
value *T .
Step 4. Set x and y equal to zero.
Step 5. If f(x, y) is greater than *T , g(x, y) is set to
255, i.e., background, and then go to step 8.
Step 6. If (0≦ f(x, y)≦ 3 *T /4)), g(x, y) is set to 0,
i.e., object, and then go to step 8.
Step 7. If S is equal to 9, g(x, y) is set to 0, i.e., object,
otherwise, g(x, y) is set to 255, i.e.,
background.
Step 8. Make the increment of x or y.
Step 9. Repeat step 5 through step 9 until all pixels
in the f(x, y) are processed.
Step 10. Stop.
In step 3, with the experimental results, we
find that the Otsu’s algorithm [2] is better than
the other algorithm for the proposed algorithm.
Let R be the rate of S over the total number of
pixels in the B×B region. It can be expressed as

With the fixed size of 3×3 region for S and

rate RR is plotted in Fig. 4, versus the different
rates of R, such as 0%, 11.1%, 33.3%, 55.6%,
77.8%, and 100%.

Since the rate R equal to 100%, i.e., S equal
to 9, can derive the best recognition rate RR, we
7The results of RR for different algorithms
with original images in Fig. 7 are shown in Fig.
8. The RR values of the proposed algorithm can
reach 100% for most images. Although the
values of RR for the proposed algorithm are
83.3% for the IMG2 image and 27% for the
IMG6 image, it can be observed that the
proposed algorithm has a higher RR over the
other algorithms.
