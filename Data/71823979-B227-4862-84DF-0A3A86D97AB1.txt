840 J. Opt. Soc. Am. A/Vol. 24, No. 3 /March 2007 J.-G. Chang and C.-T. Leeped an MD dot generation scheme that can meet most of
he needs for the integration of the subsequent optical de-
ign phase, such as the cell division technique, which di-
ided the whole domain into many subdomains, thereby
llowing for adjustment of dot density in each cell, and
he variable r-cut technique, which allows the dot density
o change within the cell. Their analysis,15 however,
hows only the illustration of the validity of the dot dis-
ribution by the MD dot generation scheme that is antici-
ated for cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) and LED
acklights, but it does not show the combination of dot op-
imization with optical design. Some considerations are
till lacking in the dot generation scheme’s ability to ac-
ommodate the optical design phase, such as the arbi-
rary addition to or removal from the cell during the op-
ical design phase, localization of the dot generation for
pecific regions, or achieving high and distinct dot density
ariation across the cells.
The objective of this study is to propose an MD dot gen-
ration scheme and a methodology to actually integrate
he dot generation scheme into the optical design phase.
he MD dot generation scheme is developed according to
he needs of the optical optimization, as mentioned in the
bove paragraph. In addition, the optimization law relat-
ng the dot density and the luminance is also proposed.
he validity of MD dot generation, as well as the method-
logy of the integration of the optical design phase, is pre-
ented and discussed in the paper.
. MATHEMATICS FORMULATION
. MD Dot Generation Scheme
he dots on the bottom of the light guide are considered
s atoms, between which atomic forces act. The atomic
orce is governed by Newton’s law of motion, expressed as
m
d2ri

n
fijri,rj, 1
here ri is the position of the ith atom, m is the atom
ass, cd is the damping term, fij is the force exerted on
tom i by neighboring atom j, and n is the total number of
eighboring atoms around atom i.
Figure 1(a) shows the forcing function used in this
cheme, in which an r-cut16 parameter is introduced to
epresent the distance within which two atoms interact
ith each other. If the distance between the two atoms is
maller than this r-cut distance, a repulsive force is estab-
ished and the atoms are mutually repelled with a force of
agnitude
frij =
rij
rij
e−rijckl, 2
here frij is the shorthand representation of fijri ,rj, ckl
s the force control parameter, and subscripts k and l are
he cell division in row number and in column number, re-
pectively, as shown in Fig. 2(a). In Fig. 2(a), the original
omain is divided into a number of smaller cells whose
ot densities can be individually adjusted. As discussed
elow, the force control parameter, ckl, is dependent onhe dot density. In each cell, the force control parameter is
iven by
ckl =
− ln fre
rcut,kl
, 3
here fre is the residual force at the r-cut distance in the
ell kl. It is noted that fre tends toward zero when rij is
arger than or equal to the r-cut distance, rcut,kl. In gen-
ral, fre is held at a small nonzero value during the MD
alculation. During the force calculations, the neighbor-
ng atoms of each atom are identified using the Verlet list
echnique,16 which reduces the n2 search to an n search,
nd the force control parameter is determined according
o their distances.
As described above, the proposed MD dot generation al-
orithm separates the domain of interest into a pre-
cribed number of individual cells in order to enhance the
exibility of the dot density adjustment procedure. In one
ell, kl, the dot density is defined as
Dkl =
Adot
Acell
=
mklr
2
Acell
, 4
here Adot is the total area of the dots in cell kl, Acell is
he area of cell kl, mkl is the total number of dots in cell
l, and r is the radius of the individual dots. In the cur-
ent approach, each cell is considered to be rectangular,
nd it is assumed that the dot radius remains constant
hroughout the domain.
. Variable r-Cut Technique
o ensure that all of the dots in one cell can interact with
ll of their neighboring dots, the total area enclosed by
he r-cut radius, Ar,kl, defined as the reactive area, should
xtend beyond the boundaries of the individual cell. In
he limiting case, the smallest reactive area, Armin,kl, in
ell kl is given byFig. 1. Repulsive force as a function of atomic distance, rij.

842 J. Opt. Soc. Am. A/Vol. 24, No. 3 /March 2007 J.-G. Chang and C.-T. Leembalance causes a less smooth dot distribution in the
dded-on cell.
The technique also allows for treating the dots added or
emoved simultaneously for more than one cell, and the
alculation of the force regulation is executed at only one
ime.
. OPTICAL MODEL
ptical components used in backlights include the light
uide, three LEDs, the backlight housing, diffuser sheets,
nd two brightness enhancement films (BEFs). For the
ight guide, the dot pattern is distributed on its bottom.
wing to the complexity of the dot patterning design, sev-
ral simplifications are made in order to make the dot
atterning design more efficient. This study omits the ef-
ects of the actual structures and optical properties for the
iffuser sheet and two BEFs in our simulations; instead,
pproximation methods are employed. For the diffuser
heet, we use the simple average method, which averages
he photometric quantity of each unit area with the other
ight unit areas surrounding it.17,18 The receiver is placed
lightly above the exiting surface of the light guide and is
ivided into a number of areas of equal size, called the
nit area, where the photometric quantity is calculated.
lthough this simple average method might not com-
letely represent the truly blurred effect of the diffuser
heet, the less blurred effect gives a more rigorous condi-
ion on the demand of the luminance uniformity for the
ot patterning on the light guide.
The specification of uniformity for backlights repre-
ents the luminance variation of the backlight measured
t 9 or 13 points by a luminance meter.19 For uniformity
f design, the luminance quantity—more specifically at
ero angle from the normal surface of the backlight—is
onsidered as the output parameter to determine whether
t meets the design requirement. Because using the lumi-
ance parameter introduces a difficult or time-consuming
omputation in the simulation due to its need to consider
he microstructure of the BEF to obtain an accurate lumi-
ance value, we use a simple analytical model that as-
umes a symmetrical luminance Gaussianlike distribu-
ion when the light passes through a two-stack BEF with
90 deg angle between the prismatic structure. This sym-
etrical Gaussianlike luminance distribution is intro-
uced as
L = L0e−1/2/
2
for  = 0 2, 7
here L0 is the luminance at =0, where  is the zenith
ngle from the pole and varies from 0 to  /2, and  is the
zimuth angle around the pole. Additionally,  is a pa-
ameter used to control the waist of the Gaussian distri-
ution and can be obtained experimentally.20 With this
ssumption, the luminance can be obtained directly from
he illuminance result from the following relationship: t0,ij = −

here Erfi is the imaginary error function21 and i=−1.
urthermore, Aij is the unit area of the receiver used in
he optical software to calculate the photometric quantity,
nd ij is the output luminous flux related to area, Aij.
ere, instead of using the whole viewing area and the to-
al luminous flux that is originally derived in reference,20
e use the unit area of the receiver and the related lumi-
ous flux in the calculation; thus, the luminance obtained
s also related to the unit area of the receiver, Aij, i.e.,
0,ij. The relationship above also provides evidence that,
n the backlight, the uniformity design of the luminance
istribution when the BEF is attached at the front of the
acklight can be reduced to the uniformity design of the
lluminance when the BEF is neglected in the simulation,
hich is under the uniformity requirement made by a 9-
r 13-point luminance measurement at zero degrees from
he pole direction.
. OPTICAL OPTIMIZATION
he dot distribution generated by the MD method is in-
roduced into the optical design phase to perform the op-
ical optimization. The goal of the optical optimization is
o find the dot distribution that achieves the EL condition
f the backlight. Thus, this optical optimization includes
n iteration process between the dot distribution genera-
ion scheme and the optical design phase; i.e., the dot dis-
ribution is changed according to the luminance, or
quivalent to illuminance, output from the optical design
oftware. The simple proportional rule of the illuminance
o the dot density is employed in this study. The deriva-
ion is introduced as follows:
The average illuminance after each iteration can be cal-
ulated as
Eav =

k,l=1
n,m
Ekl
n m
, 9
here Ekl represents the illuminance of the cell in row
umber k and column number l and n and m are the to-
al cell number for the row and column directions, respec-
ively. The illuminance, Ekl, of each cell kl is directly re-
ated to its dot density, Dkl, as
Ekl =Dkl
Acell
r2
Edot, 10
here Acell (=Acell,kl, for all kl) is the cell area; r is the dot
adius; and Edot is the illuminance redirected to the top of
he light guide by each dot on the bottom of the light

(a). It can be seen that, where the dot density has been
djusted, the dot distribution becomes less uniform and
he dots begin to overlap. The dot density adjustment is
ctually mode by randomly adding or removing the dots
n the cells where the adjustment is desired. The dot
umber given in the cells is converted from the dot den-
ity in Fig. 3(a) to that in Fig. 4(a). It should be noted that
hen dots are removed, the dot data for the previous dot
ecord is usually removed from the cells, whereas when
ots are added, the extra dots are generated by a random-
umber generator and attached to the previous dot record
or each cell. Inspecting Fig. 4(b) reveals that only two
laces have not been adjusted—the leftmost region of re-
ig. 3. (Color online) (a) Anticipated dot density distribution, (b
istribution after regulation and an enlarged view.ion II and the rightmost region of region III, which are sarked with arrow. Figure 4(c) shows the final dot distri-
ution. It can be seen that the dot distribution in the ad-
usted regions becomes more uniform than that in the ini-
ial stage of Fig. 4(b). In addition to the adjustment of the
inear variation in one dimension for regions I and II, a
eal two-dimensional distribution, where dot density
hanges linearly from higher to lower density along the
adial direction, is also attainable as shown in the en-
arged view at the bottom of Fig. 4(c).

ion for this dot density change from a two- to a one-

Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the dot density variations

ately before cell number 18. The dot density is elevated

n each iteration. Less time is consumed at the latter it-
rations owing to the smaller number of dots involved in
he change. In addition, the 800,000 ray number requires
pproximately 9.5 to 10 min for the ray-tracing calcula-
ion in each iteration.
Figure 7 show the illuminance in the final stage. It is
oted that the luminance result can be easily obtained by
caling a factor obtained from Eq. (8) for a given  value
nd a given Aij value, multiplied by the result of Fig. 7. It
s shown that the uniformity obtained for the minimum
lluminance divided by the maximum illuminance is
1.45%.
. CONCLUSION
his paper proposes an MD dot generation scheme de-
igned to be incorporated easily into the subsequent opti-
al design phase. The advantages of the MD dot genera-
ion scheme include the variable r-cut technique
ccompanying a reflective boundary condition, which al-
ows for precise dot density adjustment in each cell and
hich achieves a high dot density variation of dot distri-
ution. In addition, the add-on and remove-from tech-
iques allow for local adjustment of dot density to in-
rease or lower the cell dot density. This provides a
ignificant advantage in the integration of the optical de-
ign phase into the dot density adjustment according to
he optical quantity. Finally, an illustration of a LED
acklight design shows a two-dimensional dot distribu-
ion at regions near the light source and a one-
imensional dot distribution at regions far from the light
ource. This straightforward result also proves the valid-
ty of the simple proportional rule of illumination quan-
ity to dot density employed in the optimization procedure
nd shows the validity of the MD dot generation scheme
roposed herein.

英文：This study presents the methodology of an integration of a dot 
generation scheme by molecular dynamics (MD) method and the 
subsequent software optical design phase by software. The MD dot 
generation scheme proposed has great advantages when integrated into 
the optical design phase. These advantages include the variable r-cut 
and reflective boundary condition techniques, both of which could 
achieve the high density variation of dot distribution. In addition, we 
use a cell technique where the domain is divided into a number of 
smaller cells, allowing for flexibility in adjusting the dot density within 
each cell, as well as using the add-on or remove-from technique of the 
dots in one cell to achieve an equal luminance condition.

本次 Finetech Japan 2007 展覽中，展出之項目有平面顯示器所有相關之原料、生產設備
檢驗設備等，此外，展示所涵蓋之項目也包涵了有機發光 EL(electronic luminescence，電致發
光技術)及背光模組等，也包含了場發射(field emission)顯示器等。此次展覽也連帶Display 2007
的展出，在這個展出的項目中，是最熱門的，也是大家所最關心顯示器未來的新走向。 
展覽館分為 A，B 兩棟共佔地約 42710 平方公尺，參展廠商約有 700 家，其展出規模之
大，可謂是顯示器展示最具規模的一個。首先在 A 棟展覽館中之 Display，首先映入眼簾的是 
Futaba 廠商所展示之場發射顯示器(見圖一)，目前所製作出的螢幕尺寸仍在小尺寸的範圍內
(最大的約 288mmx43.2mm)，但也吸引了不少觀眾圍觀，畢竟場發射顯示器的技術成長是一
個值得觀察之重點。其次是 Victor JVC 所發表之倍速 120 之高速液晶電視，及世界最大尺寸
(110 吋)之液晶電視(見圖二)，倍速 120 高應答速度之液晶電視，具有在畫面高速運動時，不
會有殘影之效果，使畫面更清晰可視。此外，SONY 在會場中所發表之有機 EL 電視也吸引
了非常多的目光(見圖三)，這項產品之發表也意味的有機 EL 技術之成熟，將會為未來的顯示
器市場中，多了一個競爭的技術。在本次的展覽中，有展出多項相關 EL 的技術與產品，如
Novaled Technology 在會場中展示將 EL 技術用在車燈中(見圖四)，及東北株式會社將 EL 技
術用在背光源、美容產業、醫療器材等。其中 EL 用在背光源，是一個重要的觀察點，因為
目前的背光源構造複雜，部品繁多，而 EL 之背光具有裝置簡單、光源輝度均一等特性，這
項技術的成熟，意味著未來背光源可能將被 EL 技術所取代。 
在 B 棟的展示會中，展出了非常多關於 FPD 的製造設備，有清洗、圖佈、無塵室真空、
膠片裁切、玻璃基板運送等設備及相關 EL 製程之技術。其中最引人注目的就是兩部第十代
廠之玻璃基板運送之機械手臂裝置(見圖五)，這兩部機器大約高有三層樓高，機械裝置雖然很
龐大，整個動起來確很安靜，可見日本在驅動馬達方面成熟的技術。 
在本次之展覽中亦有針對背光模組之部品及新產品做一詳細的展示，包括増量膜、擴散
片及導光板之材料。在增亮膜的部份，有一家日本廠商展出，除了 V-cut 結構外之特殊結構
之增亮膜，其結構形狀類似金字塔型(見圖六)。於會中並詢問該接待人員，關於其不同微結
構的應用範圍，據接待人員之說法，主要用於增亮膜之客制化要求，也希望該廠能寄 sample
給本單位，提供研究所需。在擴散膜之部份，NIGATA 公司，所製作之擴散片上具有不同之
微結構(見圖七)，據了解，不同之微結構會有不同之擴散角度，此外該公司也製作超薄導光
板，並生產超薄肉厚之射出機，15 吋之導光板，所製作出之厚度，可達 1.8mm(見圖八)，可
見該公司之技術水平。在導光板的發展趨勢，未來將走向超薄肉厚之導光板，其主要之關鍵
技術為射出技術，及模具技術，如何利用一般現有噸數之射出機，配合模具設計射出超薄肉
