A facile method for synthesizing nanosized silver colloids with high conversion and narrow size 
distribution 
Yu-Chieh Lu* and Kan-Sen Chou, 
Department of Chemical EngineeringNational Tsing Hua UniversityHsinchu, Taiwan 30013 
 
Abstract 
In this study we developed a facile method for 
synthesizing nanosized Ag colloids with the novel use of 
urea to produce intermediates as Ag precursor, which are 
agglomerates but can be well redispersed once they 
transform to silver by dextrose reduction. In addition, the 
intermediate were characterized by XRD, SEM and 
UV-Vis spectrometer, the effects of NaOH quantity on 
colloidal size and silver conversion were also investigated 
by TEM analysis and quantitative measurement of silver 
ion concentration. At the molar ratio of [Urea]/[Ag+]=4, 
[NaOH]/[Ag+]=0.8, dextrose as reducing agent and 
reaction temperature at 70oC, we could successively 
obtain silver colloids of average size 22 nm and standard 
deviation 4.7 nm after separation and washing procedures. 
The conversion for this condition was nearly complete at 
about 98%.  
 
1. Introduction 
Due to its excellent electrical, thermal, optical and/or 
catalytic properties, nanosized silver colloids have 
received much attention in recent years for various 
potential applications such as conductor, catalyst, and 
chemical sensor, etc. [1-5]. Although there are many 
different techniques to synthesize these nanosized silver 
particles, yet based on the literature information, wet 
chemical method is probably the most popular one for its 
simplicity, low cost and easiness of manipulation. The 
typical method for chemical reduction in water-phase 
process is that, in addition to the metallic precursor and 
the reductant, the reaction solution often contains some 
additives to inhibit particle aggregation. This additive, a 
surfactant or some protective agent, would adsorb on the 
surface of particles to form a protective layer to avoid 
aggregation between particles.  
As for the reductant, when a strong reagent such as 
sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or hydrazine (N2H4) is used, 
because of the too fast reaction and uneven dispersion, 
there is not enough time for PVP molecules to adsorb 
onto the particle surface to provide a protective layer, lots 
of locally formed Ag nuclei will aggregate and hence 
results in products with large particle size and broad 
distribution. In order to slow down the reaction rate, one 
would then have to lower the initial precursor 
concentration and reaction temperature. Under these 
conditions, the silver conversion can be high, yet the 
particles are often larger than 50 nm [2, 6].  
On the other hand, when a moderate reductant is used 
such as formaldehye, one could obtain silver particles 
with a mean size of 27.8 nm and standard deviation of 9.9 
nm for an initial silver concentration of 0.1 M [7, 8]. 
Panigrahi et al. [9] tried glucose as reductant to obtain Ag 
particles with about 20nm in size, but the products were 
not uniform enough. Hu et al. [10] used trisodium citrate 
to prepare silver nanorods and nanowires based on the 
principle of slow reduction rate and non-isotropic 
adsorption of surfactant. Silvert et al. [11] obtained 
fine-sized Ag particles whose size distribution is between 
15-36nm by polyol reduction. Despite these efforts, it is 
still difficult to prepare silver particles of less than 20 nm 
and with narrow distribution from an aqueous solution. 
For the polyol process, the reaction temperature has to be 
120oC or higher and therefore it adds to the cost of 
fabrication. Much finer particles (less than 10 nm) can be 
Because the decomposition rate of urea is greatly 
influenced by solution’s pH and ambient temperature. It 
increases as pH or temperature rises [17, 18]. For case of 
[NaOH]/[AgNO3]=0.4, when solution R1 injected into 
solution R2 in which the pH was about 11, the alkaline 
solution accelerated the decomposition greatly and 
immediately produced lots of cyanate ions and carbonate 
ions. In addition, the Ksp values of AgOCN and Ag2CO3 
are both smaller than that of Ag2O, therefore the X-ray 
diffraction peaks of the initial precipitation consist of the 
peaks of silver cyanate and silver carbonate but no ones of 
silver oxide can be found. 
 
 
Figure 1. XRD patterns of powders of AgOCN, Ag2CO3 
and Ag2O. The intermediate product in our case is a 
mixture of AgOCN (signified by □) and Ag2CO3 
(signified by ■). 
 
 
Figure 2. Changes of Ag+ ions as a function of reaction 
time in the different ratios of [Urea]/[ Ag+]. 
 
In addition, in the presence of reducing agent the initial 
precipitate is not stable and gradually converts to silver 
and that leads the changes of color. We find the sustained 
time of intermediate is closely related to the ratio of 
[Urea]/[Ag+], and apparently increases as the ratio rising. 
For example, in condition of NaOH/AgNO3=0.4, the 
sustained time takes totally about 5 minutes for case of 
[Urea]/[Ag+]=4 to change color from yellow through 
brown to final black, and more than 10 minutes for case 
of [Urea]/[Ag+]=8. On the other hand, the sustained time 
also increased as the quantity of NaOH decreased. We 
thought that NaOH is capable of accelerate the reduction 
rate while urea here has an effect upon the chelation with 
Ag+ ions to slow down the reaction. The transformation 
rate of intermediate decreases with increase of urea 
present, and therefore it takes more time to carry 
reduction out. 
 
 
Figure 3. Conversions of Ag+ ions as functions of time in 
the different ratios of [NaOH]/[Ag+], where 
[Urea]/[Ag+]=4, and the reaction was performed in 70°C 
water-bath. 
 
Figure 2 showed the changes of Ag+ ions as a function 
of reaction time in the different ratios of [Urea]/[ Ag+]. 
There was abrupt rise instantly as reaction started, but the 
conversion kept nearly constant within following 1 
minute even though adding different amounts of urea. We 
believed this step was only a period of transformation 
from intermediate to silver, because there was no obvious 
change of [Ag+] concentration within following 30 
minutes. 
control), it proved that use of urea in the synthesis process 
to control the particle size and distribution was feasible. 
 
 
Figure 7. Representative scheme of nano-silver synthesis 
procedure 
 
In general, the control over particle size and its 
distribution is usually associated with the species and 
quantities of the chemicals used. But sometimes the 
design of reaction route is a trick in preparation. The 
synthesis process in this study can be briefly presented as 
a scheme shown in figure 7. In order to obtain particles 
with narrow distribution, we divide the process into two 
steps. The first step is that to prepare an intermediate and 
then transform them to silver by reduction carrying out. 
Compared with the intermediate, silver has a good affinity 
for PVP and hence it is capable of being redispersed. 
Because the transformation of intermediate takes place 
only in the reduction condition, the choice of reducing 
agent is important. In principle, the weak reducing agent 
is suitable for the process due to its low reduction rate and 
so that there are enough time to get dispersion. Figure 3(e) 
showed the SEM images of particles made by 
formaldehyde reduction. Compared with dextrose 
reduction, even though the above two preparation were 
performed in the same procedure, there were still obvious 
difference in particles including size and distribution. As 
to the second step, although dextrose is a good candidate 
for reducing agent, however, the reaction of dextrose 
reduction is slow, once the colloidal particles are 
well-dispersed, we perform the solution in 70°C 
water-bath to accelerate the reaction in order to obtain 
high conversion within fixed period. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, we have developed a facile and 
cost-effective method for synthesizing fine silver particles, 
with a mean size is 22 nm and standard deviation of 4.7 
nm after washing and re-dispersion. This process also 
exhibited high conversion (96% and 98% for respective 
30 and 60 minutes) using 0.156M of [Ag+] concentration. 
With dextrose as the reducing agent, the purpose of urea 
used in this work is to produce intermediate as Ag 
precursor in order to obtain a well-dispersed suspension. 
We studied the characterization of intermediate by XRD, 
SEM and zeta-potential. Also, the effect of NaOH 
quantity on size distribution and conversion via TEM 
analysis, and quantitative measurement of silver ions 
concentration is discussed. In the result, although high 
quantity of NaOH is beneficial to increase the 
conversion of final silver colloids, but it also 
weakens the protective effect of PVP, especially 
in condition of [NaOH]/[AgNO3] > 0.8, and that 
should be concerned.

Preparation and characterization of Ag-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles by chemical reduciton 
Kan-Sen Chou*, Yu-Chieh Lu and An-Yi Wu 
Department of Chemical EngineeringNational Tsing Hua UniversityHsinchu, Taiwan 30013 
 
Abstract 
  In this study, a facile method has been developed to 
synthesize nanosized Ag-Cu colloidal suspension by 
dextrose reduction. Urea used in the process is not only to 
provide homogeneous supply of alkaline ions to raise the 
reaction conversion but to narrow the size distribution of 
colloidal particles. The particles are characterized by 
TEM, XRD and XPS techniques. With proper 
purification, these Ag-Cu colloids can be directly written 
on the substrate by felt-tip pen to make a conducting line. 
We also proved that addition of Cu is helpful to slow 
down electrical migration. Besides, Ag-Cu films can 
show different colors and luster depending on their 
composition which is variable of heat temperature.  
 
1. Introduction 
  Ultrafine particles have drawn considerable attention in 
recent decades because they exhibit specific chemical and 
physical properties compared to bulk materials. Noble 
metallic nanoparticles in particular, showing 
size-dependent optical, catalytic and electric properties 
may lead to many potential applications [1-3]. Bimetallic 
nanopaticles, on the other hand, consisting of two 
different kinds of metal have unique properties distinct 
from monometallic nanopartilcles. For example, alloying 
element composing of silver and gold shows strong 
absorption peak between pure silver as well as gold, 
which exhibit characteristic peak around 400nm and 
520nm, respectively [4]. Toshima et al. [5] showed that 
some core-shell structured bimetallic nanoparticles had 
better catalytic activity than monometallic materials. 
  Various techeniques have been developed to prepare 
the bimetallic colloidal particles in solutions. Baglioni 
and coworkers [6] have reported the preparation of 
AuCu3 nanoparticles in reverse micelles . Kim et al. [7] 
have reported the synthesis of AuCu and Au4Cu 
nanoparticles in sol–gel processed silica matrices. The 
preparation of Au-Ag nanoparticles in solution has been 
carried out recently employing a microemulsion method 
[8]. Researches on other nanoparticles such as Au-Pt, 
Pd-Pt, Cu-Pd, and Cu-Pt were also reported by some 
laboratories [9-12]. Ag-Cu alloys have been synthesized 
by physical methods such as sputtering [13] and thermal 
evaporation [14], or chemical routes including 
electrochemical deposition technique [15] as well as 
sol-gel process [16]. However, synthesizing manners of 
zero-dimensional particles [17-18] were fewer compared 
to the as-mentioned methods. In this work, we have 
successfully prepared the bimetallic Ag-Cu nanoparticles 
by a simple chemical reduction method. Dextrose utilized 
here is to reduce both copper and silver precursors. 
Compared to those strong reductants including 
hydrazine[19], sodium borohydrdride[20] and sodium 
hypophosphite[21], dextrose is considered a mild, 
environment-friendly reducing agent, providing a green 
route to synthesize the Ag-Cu nanoparticles. On the other 
hand, the hybrid alkaline reagents, sodium hydroxide and 
urea, are both added to adjust the pH value of the solution; 
the former releases OH－ ions which is consumed rapidly 
at the initial stage, whereas the latter successively 
supplies OH－  ions at higher temperature during the 
reaction. In addition, particle size can be controlled by 
the protecting agent polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 
used here.  
  Besides, due to their low electrical resistivity, silver 
and copper have been studied broadly as interconnection 
materials in integral technology. Compared with the 
traditional material Al, both Cu and Ag have the 
advantages of lower resistivity as well as higher 
resistance against electrical migration behavior, which is 
often used as criteria of reliability for integrated circuit 
[22-25]. With the benefits, the utilization of interconnects 
have been gradually shifted from Al to Cu or Ag. In 
addition, due to its low viscosity, metal ink can be 
directly written onto substrate to form a conducting line. 
Combined with some output devices such as ink-jet 
printer or plotter, conducting pattern can be tailored and 
created rapidly, it is more convenient to deal with than the 
conventional lithography technology [26-28]. In this 
work, the conducting line composed of Ag-Cu bimetallic 
nanoparticles was also applied with current to examine its 
electrical migration behavior. 
 
2. Experimental details 
2.1. Synthesis for Ag-Cu alloy particles 
  All the reactants were first prepared in three separate 
solutions, i.e. R1, R2 and R3. Solution R1 contained  
0.15 M AgNO3 and urea (the concentration was between 
0 and 1.67M). Solution R2 contained 0.33 M dextrose 
(C6H12O6), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) with its quantity 
fixed at 8 g PVP g−1 AgNO3 and 0.06 M NaOH. Solution 
R3 contained with variable quantities of  
Cu(NO3)2 (the molar ratio of [Cu2+]/[Ag+] was between 
0.11 and 1). With stirring and at the ambient temperature, 
solution R1 was rapidly poured into solution R2. After 
the color of mixture went black, solution R3 was poured 
into the above mixture and finally transferred to a water

Fig.3 Composition analysis of Ag77Cu23 particles studied 
by HRXPS (a) composition varied with depth profile (b) 
suggested particle model. Mean size of Ag77Cu23 particles 
used here was about 200nm. 
 
  Next, figure 2 showed the XRD diagram of dried 
Ag77Cu23 powders. The crystallinity of copper in 
as-synthesized Ag77Cu23 powders was poor because the 
diffraction peaks were almost similar to those of pure 
silver powders. While performed with 200℃ heat 
treatment for 30 minutes, its major diffraction peak 
shifted from initial 36.56° to 38.18°. Also, the FWHM 
narrowed and peak strengthened, which meant the 
crystallinity was increased. 
  As to particle structure, figure 3(a) showed the XPS 
result upon 200nm- Ag77Cu23 particle. It was seen that the 
weight ratio of Ag/Cu was not uniform through whole 
particle, and we could model it as figure 3(b), in which 
particle was a sandwich-like sphere composed of 
respectively Ag-rich, Cu-rich and Ag-rich structure from 
inside to outside. 
 
distribution as a function of film depth can be studied. 
Copper has higher chemical activity than silver, activated 
copper after heat treatment diffused upward and the 
atomic concentration of copper increased in the film 
surface, so that resulted in the change of film color. 
Owing to its particular property on optics after heating 
and easy handling, Ag-Cu colloidal suspension may have 
promising potential for art purpose. 
 
4. Conclusion 
  Based on the results presented in this work, one can 
obtain the following conclusions: 
Ag-Cu colloidal suspension can be successfully prepared 
by dextrose reduction. Urea used here is not only to 
provide homogeneous supply of alkaline ions to raise the 
reaction conversion but to narrow the size distribution of 
colloidal particles. Even though urea has the above 
advantages, but the contrary effect should also be 
concerned. 
  The crystallinity of copper in as-synthesized Ag-Cu 
particles is very poor, but can be effectively improved by 
heat treatment with 200℃ for 30 minutes. 
  Electrical migration of conducting line can be 
effectively slow down by adding some copper in silver 
particles. After applying with current whose density was 
1.4×108A/m2 for 150 hours the increasing ratio of 
resistance of Ag72Cu28 was only 1%. 
Composition distribution of Ag-Cu film would be altered 
with heat treatment, and that resulted in its change in 
color and luster. In this work Ag77Cu23 film can shows 
bright gold luster after heating with 250℃ for 30 
minutes.

used in this work were synthesized with the chemical 
reduction method. Its average particle size was about 
30nm for this case [7]. The composition of the silver 
colloidal suspension (ink) is as followed: Ag 
nanoparticles 4wt%, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (molecular 
weight = 40 000, BASF) 0.2wt%, diethylene glycol 
(Tedia) 5wt%, DI water 90.8 wt%. The activated 
substrates were then heated at 80℃ to remove solvent for 
10min.The plating solution contained CuSO4‧5H2O 18 
g/l, EDTA 48 g/l, K4[Fe(CN)6]  57.3 mg/l, HCHO 22.5 
ml/l , HCl (18 M) 1 ml/l [11] , and some NaOH (adjust 
pH= 12.8)[8]. The working temperature of the plating 
solution is 60℃, and the average growing rate of the 
copper film of this plating solution is about 7.2µm hr-1. 
 
Adhesion and electric resistivity test－The PET films 
treated by three different sizes of Al2O3 were then coated 
by the silver colloid through dip coating method and 
dried at 80℃ for 10min. Then the PET films were placed 
in the plating solution to deposit copper films for 30 
minutes. After rinsing and drying, the samples were 
examined byα-step for its roughness, by the peel adhesion 
of 3M tape test (ASTM D3330) (4-1000, Scotch, 3M )for 
adhesion strength between deposited copper film and 
substrate and by microohmmeter for its electric 
resistance. 
 
Electric circuit patterning －The silver ink was then 
filled to a plotter pen (0.18mm, MUTOH), and drew 
electric circuit patterns on the treated PET films by 
computer controlled plotter (DXY-1150, Roland). The 
patterned substrates were then heated at 80℃ for 10 
minutes to remove solvent. Then the patterned PET films 
were electroless copper plated by the process as 
mentioned above.

Results and Discussion 
PET surface treatment and copper films 
characteristics－In this work, we use the Al2O3 particle 
blasting technique to treat the PET films. The result 
shows the bigger Al2O3 particles caused the deeper pits. 
This is shown in table 1 and the SEM picture of PET 
surface which was treated by 30µm Al2O3 powder is 
shown in figure 2. After the copper deposition process, 
the measured roughness of the film became 0.61µm that 
is the roughness of the copper film. From the SEM 
picture we can find that the deposited copper film was 
constructed by a lot of copper grains with spherical shape, 
but from the larger amplification SEM picture we can 
find that the sub copper grain is diamond shape structure 
and the grain size is about 1µm, as shown in figure 3 and 
4. The roughness of the sample which treated by the 
60µm Al2O3 powder is 1.30µm for PET film 0.97µm for 
deposited copper; and the sample which treated by the 
100µm Al2O3 powder is 2.23µm for PET film 1.58µm for 
deposited copper. In the two cases, theirs roughness tend 
to become smoother after electroless copper plating since 
some deep pits were filled with the copper grains, but 
theirs surface are still too rough.  
The adhesion strength between the deposited copper 
film and the PET film is also tested. All samples pass the 
3M tape test, but the measured values are limited by the
