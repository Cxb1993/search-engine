Abstract 
 
 In this study, the flexible-supercapacitors 
were electrodeposited gold/manganese oxides 
thin film with potassium permanganate and 
gold chloride solution on ITO-PET substrate. 
It was deposited for 200s by potentiostatic 
method ( -0.7V v.s. open circuit).  The 
morphology and the microstructure of the 
films were examined by SEM (scan electron 
microscopy) and TEM (Transmission electron 
microscopy).  The thickness of the thin films 
was about 30~100nm with -0.7V and the thin 
films composed of MnO2 nano particles with 
Au.  And the states of the ions were 
investigated by X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS).  Such nano structure of 
the thin film contributes to much higher 
capacitance than traditional thin film 
supercapacitors.  This is attributed to the 
lowering of impedance of the 
nano-supercapacitor by adding Au.  In this 
study, the film with    1.6wt% god has trice 
capacitance and power than pure MnO2 .

Introduction 
Capacitors have two main applications; 
first is a function to charge or discharge 
electricity. It is applied to backup circuits of 
microcomputers, smoothing circuits of power 
supplies, and timer circuits that make use of 
the periods to charge or discharge electricity. 
The other is a flow of DC. Follow the IC 
industry, they products become smaller.  The 
supercapacitors in general exhibit a high 
power density will become more necessary. 
In development of energy storage devices, the 
manganese oxides are a low cost and 
contributions that faradaic charge transfer 
processes and good performing candidate for 
nano-supercapacitor. Several studies have 
been carried out on amorphous or 
nanocrystallized MnO2 compounds obtained 
by the sol–gel route [1], or coprecipitation [2] 
or electrodeposition [3].   But it also 
exhibits a relatively high resistance for the 
pure manganese oxides thin film. So 
films as in (Fig. 4(a)). As the gold was added, 
the ions of Mn3+ was decreased with the gold 
increased (Fig. 4 (b)~(d)). And the Mn2+ was 
increased with the gold increased.(Fig.4 
(b)~(d)) . And the Mn5+ was increased with 
the gold increased. (Fig.2 (b)~(d)). The Fig.5 
shows the peaks of the O1s The binding 
energy literature data of the O1s1/2 for the 
pure manganese oxides are 529.7eV for the 
Mn-O-Mn, 531.1eV for the Mn-O-H,[8,9,10] 
532,14eV for the H-O-H.[11] The peaks of 
the O1s1/2 show that they have three ion 
states on these films. As the gold increased 
the bind of Mn-O-H was increased and the 
bind of the H-O-H was decreased with the 
wt% of gold was increased. Fig. 6 shows 
Au4f XPS spectra for coprecipitates with Au 
wt% of 0~0.8. The spectrum for a 
coprecipitate with Au 0.2~0.8 wt% indicates 
that all the gold coprecipitated with 
manganese oxides was present as atomic state 
Au(0). [7] This indicates that the binding 
states of Mn2P3/2 for the pure manganese 
oxides which was electrodeposited with 
potentiostatic method ( -0.7V v.s. open circuit) 
film are main in Mn3+ and Mn5+.  As the 
gold increased the valence of Mn shifts from 
+3 to +5 and +2. In the other hand, the 
binding states of the O1s1/2 show that as the 
gold added the states of oxides shifts from 
H-O-H (structure water) to 
Mn-O-H(hydroxide).  
Figure 7 shows that the composite 
electrode material (Au/MnOx) tested by cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) in a 0.1M KNO3 solution 
at room temperature.  All of the data was 
divided by the thickness of the films.   
Table 1 summarizes capacitances of the 
samples with different Au content, which 
were calculated from the voltammetry curves 
with the Eq.1 (1).

The capacitance values as found 
increased with the increase of the ratio of the 
Au/Mn.  Figure 7(a) shows the cyclic 
voltammogram for thin film without Au 
addition with capacitance of 513.85 F/cm3.  
As the Au added, in 0.2wt% the capacitance 
was decreased which was 363.17 F/cm3. 
(fig.7 (b)) when the Au was increased the 
capacitance of those films was increased. 
(fig.7 (b~d))  The highest capacitance was 
620.67 F/cm3 by the film with 1.6wt% Au 
added. In the shapes of CVs for the films 
shows that the potential rage the current is 
nearly constant and roughly rectangular 
mirror images characteristic of capacitive 
behavior. The observed capacitance of thin 
manganese oxides films is believed to be 
predominantly due to pseudocapacitance as 
result of redox processes associated with the 
reduction of MnO2 to MnOOH without phase 
change. And the reaction shows in Eq.(2)[12] 
)2)...(5.00(2122 <<+⇔+ − δδδ HMnOHMnOMnOMnOOH
    As the Au added the water of the 
structure was decreased. (fig.5)  In the CVs, 
because the structure water of the nano 
particle was decreased the area of electric 
double layer (EDL) was decreased. And the 
reaction of the redox processes of MnO2 to 
MnOOH was decreased (fig. 7(b~d)).  As 
the Au increased the wt% of the Au was 
increased.  
The electrochemical impedances of the 
Au/manganese oxides thin film 
supercapacitor cells were measured. (Fig. 6)

Fig. 8(a) shows that the impedance spectra of 
the pure MnO2.  In high frequency resistance, 
it shows the higher interface capacitor and 
inner resistance for the films and electrolyte. 
In low frequency resistance it shows a little 
pseudocapacitor with the films.   Fig.8 (b~c) 
shows that when the Au added the impedance 
was decreased especially in high frequency.  
As the Au was increased the resistances of the 
films were increased. That because the 
structure water of the film was decreased, and
