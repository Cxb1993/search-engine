ABSTRACT 
    Three-component acrylic copolymers used as a binder for negative-type photoresists were 
synthesized and characterized. First, free radical polymerization was employed to synthesize 
two-component binders, i.e., acrylic ester copolymers with different ratios of benzyl methacrylate 
(BZMA) and methacrylic acid (MAA). Thermal behavior, viscosity and molecular weight of the 
prepared two-component binders were studied. Then, a series of three-component binders were 
prepared through incorporation of another monomer, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (2-HEMA). 
FTIR was used to examine the evolution of chemical bonds at various stages of the synthetic 
process. Thermal analyses, TGA and DSC, were used to evaluate the level of enhancement on 
thermal stabilities of the prepared three-component binders. Finally, an optimal region in the ternary 
composition diagram of BZMA, MAA, and 2-HEMA can be identified by comparing the results of 
acid value, viscosity and molecular weight of the binder.

property, acid value, or chemical structure, the 
formed binder solution was diluted with 
tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then poured into 
hexane to induce polymer precipitation. The 
precipitation procedure was repeated twice to 
ensure free of residual monomers. Finally, the 
white polymer precipitate were separated by 
filtration and then dried in vacuo at 60oC. 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Three-component binders were prepared 
by incorporation of the third kind of acrylate 
monomer, 2-HEMA, in the synthesis process. 
Because of its hydroxyl group, 2-HEMA could 
enhance the adhesion between photoresist and 
glass substrate. However, viscosity of the 
prepared binder will increase as 2-HEMA 
content increases. In the discussion that follows, 
thermal behavior, viscosity, Mw and acid value 
of three-component binders were presented and 
compared. Compositions of the three 
monomers in the binder were illustrated in 
terms of a “ternary composition diagram” (cf. 
Fig.1 (▲)).

(a) Thermal behaviors 
Glass transition temperatures (Tg) of pure 
poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) is 55oC, as 
obtained from the literature. Previous results of 
two-component binders showed that Tg 
increased with increasing MAA content. DSC 
thermograms of the three-component binders 
are shown in Fig. 2, and Tg values are collected 
in Table 1. It appears that Tg of the binders with 
the same BZMA/MAA ratio were very close to 
each other, regardless of the 2-HEMA content. 
Specifically, for the case of BZMA/MAA= 9:1, 
Tg of the four binders are all closed to 74oC. 
However, Tg of the B80M20H0 was still 
slightly higher than that of B56M14H30, ca. 
1.4oC, due to the higher content of MAA. On 
the other hand, for samples of the same 
2-HEMA content, Tg increased with increasing 
MAA content, in accordance with the previous 
results.

(b) Characterization of chemical structure 
Fig. 4(a) illustrates the FTIR spectrum of a 
prepared three-component binder, B54M36H10. 
The absorption peaks at 3500 and 3261cm-1 
were due to the –OH stretching bands of 
hydroxyl group and carboxyl group, 
respectively. The =C-H stretching band of the 
aromatic ring (BZMA unit) was observed from 
2950 to 3065cm-1, and the C=O stretching band 
of the carbonyl group at 1729cm-1 (MAA unit) 
and 1708cm-1 (2-HEMA unit) could also be 
observed. For the 2-HEMA unit, the stretching 
band of the ester group (C-O-C) was observed 
at 1146cm-1. Furthermore, two C-H vibration 
bands of monosubstituted benzene (BZMA unit) 
were observed at 701 and 748 cm-1. The 
spectrum suggests that the three kinds of 
acrylate monomers were successfully linked 
together to form a binder by free-radical 
polymerization. Fig. 4(b) shows FTIR spectrum 
of the binder, B54M36H10, that had been 
baked at 220oC for 1h. The asymmetric and 
symmetric stretching vibrations of the two C=O 
groups of a formed anhydride were observed at 
1805cm-1 and 1762cm-1, respectively; 
furthermore, the anhydride also had a strong 
band at 1019cm-1 due to the C-O-C stretching 
vibration. This result indicates that the 
anhydride was produced after the binder was 
baked at 220oC for 1h. Therefore, as the binder 
contained more MAA or 2-HEMA, the weight 
loss in the first-stage degradation of TGA 
experiment would be more pronounced, in 
accordance with the TGA results shown in Fig. 
3.

CONCLUSIONS 
In this research, three-component binders 
composed of MAA, BZMA, and 2-HEMA 
were prepared by means of free radical 
copolymerization. The thermal behaviors, 
chemical structures, and other general 
properties of the formed binders were 
investigated. Compositions of the monomers 
for binder synthesis were determined with the 
aid of a ternary composition diagram. As the 
MAA content was increased, not only was the 
acid value but also the thermal stability of the 
binders, e.g., Tg and Td, enhanced.
