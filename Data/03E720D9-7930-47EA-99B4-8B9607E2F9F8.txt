1.1. Loss Measure with Symmetric Tolerances 
Johnson (1992) developed the so-called relative expected loss eL  for symmetric 
case, which is defined as the ratio of the expected quadratic loss and the square of the 
half specification width:

where ( )F x  is the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the measured 
characteristic. If we denote the first term 2[( ) / ]T dµ −  by otL  and the second term 
2( / )dσ  by peL , then eL  can be rewritten as e ot peL L L= + . Unfortunately, the index 
eL  inconsistently measures process capability in many cases, particularly for processes 
with asymmetric tolerances, and thus reflects process potential and performance 
inaccurately.  
1.2. Loss Measure with Asymmetric Tolerances 
To remedy for this, Pearn et al. (2006a) proposed a modification of expected loss 
index, which referred to as eL′′ , to handle processes with both symmetric and asymmetric 
tolerances. Regardless of whether the tolerances are symmetric or asymmetric, the new 
index obtains the minimal value at Tµ = . Additionally, the half specification width d is 
substituted by *d . This generalization of expected loss index may be expressed as 
follows:

To obtain the estimated value of eL′′ , sample data must be collected, and a great 
degree of uncertainty may be introduced into capability assessments owing to the 
sampling errors. The approach by simply looking at the calculated values of the 
estimated indices and then make a conclusion on whether the given process is capable, is 
highly unreliable since the sampling errors have been ignored. As the use of the 
capability indices grows more widespread, users are becoming educated and sensitive to 
the impact of the estimators and their sampling distributions on constructing confidence 
intervals and performing hypothesis testing.   
3. Sampling Distributions of the Estimated Process Loss Indices 
Let 1 2, , , nX X X…  be a random sample of size n from a normally distributed 
process 2( , )N µ σ  with mean µ  and standard deviation σ . To estimate the 
generalization eL′′ , Pearn et al. (2006a) proposed the natural estimator ˆeL′′ , which is 
defined as:

where ˆ max{( ) / , ( ) / }u lA X T d D T X d D= − ⋅ − ⋅ , the mean µ  is estimated by the 
sample mean,

maximum likelihood estimator. By letting * 2ˆˆ ( / )otL A d′′ =  and * 2ˆ ( / )pe nL S d′′ = , the 
relationship ˆ ˆ ˆe ot peL L L′′ ′′ ′′= +  may be established.  
For the case where the production tolerance is symmetric, Aˆ  may be simplified as 
| |X T− . Therefore, the estimator ˆeL′′  reduces to 1 2ˆ ( )eL n d− −= ⋅ 21( )

natural estimator of eL  discuss by Johnson (1992). Consequently, we may view the 
estimator ˆeL′′  as a direct extension of ˆeL . In the following, we focus on sampling 
distributions of the estimated process loss indices ˆpeL′′ , ˆotL′′  and ˆeL′′ .

( ) ( )ZF z z δ= Φ −  and the p.d.f. of Z as ( ) ( )Zf z zφ δ= − , respectively. The c.d.f. of Y 
can be written as:

3.2. Sampling Distribution of ˆ ′′otL  
Theorem 2. Let 1 2, , , nX X X…  be a random sample of size n from a normally 
distributed process 2( , )N µ σ . Then the p.d.f. and the c.d.f. of ˆotL′′  can be expressed 
respectively as:

The last equality is valid since ( ) 0Bx y− ≥  for 0 y Bx≤ ≤ , and ( ) 0Bx y− <  for 
y Bx> .  Thus, ( ) 0KF Bx y− =  for y Bx> . Using (15) the distribution function ˆ ( )eLF x′′  
can be expressed as (24).

Note that K is distributed as 2-1χ n , so (0) 0KF = . By changing variable ( )t = y / Bx  in

Using (15) the p.d.f. ˆ ( )

f x′′  can be expressed as (23). 
For the case when the specification tolerance is symmetric, then u lD D d= = , 
1u ld d= =  and estimator of the expected loss index ˆeL′′  reduces to ˆeL . The p.d.f. (23) 
and the c.d.f. (24) of ˆeL′′  reduce to those of ˆeL . Hence, the c.d.f. and the p.d.f. of ˆeL  
can be expressed respectively as:

Furthermore, for symmetric tolerances since Y follows a non-central chi-square 
distribution with one degree of freedom and non-centrality parameter δ , we can 
substitute the p.d.f. of Y as expressed in (17) into (25). Hence, the c.d.f. of ˆeL  can be 
expressed in an alternative form as:

From Figures 3-6, we discover that as the value of eL′′  increases, the spread of the 
distribution also increases. For small sample size n = 10 as example, the distributions are 
skew to the right (have positive skewness) and have large spread. As sample size n 
increases, the spread decreases and so does the skewness. We also observe that ˆeL′′  is 
approximately unbiased and bell-shaped for sample size n greater than 50. 
 
5. A Decision-Making Rule for Testing e′′L  
Under normality assumption, we proved that the c.d.f. and the p.d.f. of ˆeL′′  can be 
represented in terms of a mixture of the central chi-square distribution and the normal 
distribution. Using the index eL′′ , the engineers can assess the process performance and 
monitor the manufacturing processes on routine basis. To obtain an effective decision- 
making rule, we consider a testing hypothesis with the null hypothesis and the alternative 
hypothesis respectively as

We note that the distribution characteristic parameter ( ) /a Tµ σ= −  in (33) is 
usually unknown, which has to be estimated in real applications, naturally by substituting 
µ  and 2σ  by the sample mean X  and the maximum likelihood estimator 
2 2

( ) /nn iiS X X n== −∑ . To realize the relationship between cα  and a , we examine the 
behavior of cα  against a = 3− (0.05)3, which covers a wide range of applications with 
process capability analysis. The results indicate that the critical value reaches its 
minimum at 0.5a =  in all cases with accuracy up to 310− . Figures 7-10 plot the curves 
of cα  versus a  for some selected cases.  
5.1. Making Decision by Critical Value 
Tables 1-2 display the critical values cα  for 3 u lD D= , 3 2u lD D= , respectively, 
with C = 0.05, sample size n = 100, a = 3− (0.2)3 and α = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10. To test if the 
process meets the capability requirement, we first determine the value of C and α , then 
estimate the index eL′′  and parameter a  from the collected sample. If the calculated 
value of ˆeL′′  is smaller than the critical value cα  ( ˆeL cα′′ < ), then we conclude that the 
process meets the capability requirement ( eL C′′ < ). Otherwise, we do not have sufficient 
information to conclude whether the process meets the preset capability requirement. In 
this case, we would believe that eL C′′ ≥  (the process is incapable).  
5.2. Making Decision by p-value 
We also can calculate the p-value, i.e., the probability that ˆeL′′  does not exceed the 
observed index given the values of C, ud , ld , a and sample size n, and then compare 
this probability with the significance level α . If the estimated index value is 0l , then the 
p-value can be calculated as:

loss e ot peL L L′′ ′′ ′′= + , which provides an uncontaminated separation between information 
concerning the relative inconsistency loss ( peL′′ ) and the relative off-target loss ( otL′′ ). In 
this paper, we considered the three indices, and derive the sampling distributions of their 
natural estimators under normality assumption. In addition, the theory of testing 
statistical hypothesis was used to determine whether a process is capable or not. For 
illustrative purpose, we demonstrated the use of derived results by presenting a case 
study on LED manufacturing process, to evaluate the process performance.
