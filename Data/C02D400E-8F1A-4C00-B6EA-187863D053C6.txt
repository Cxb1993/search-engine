GHz - 2.484 GHz). The simulated and 
measured results obtained firmly demonstrate 
the attractive properties of the proposed 
MEFSS. 
 
                                                                                                          
2. Design Concept and Procedure 
 
 We present a fundamental concept for 
the design suggesting that a lumped-type 
element for the construction of a frequency 
selective surface can be directly transformed 
from a resonant-type element. For illustration, 
the Jerusalem cross (JC) element [5]—a 
traditional and widely applied resonant-type 
element—was selected and studied. As 
described in [5], the JC element consists of a 
pair of crossed dipoles with end loading. 
Accordingly, the current distribution on this 
element of a band-stop frequency selective 
surface at its resonant frequency, induced by 
a normally incident plane-wave polarized 
along the horizontal direction, is almost 
sinusoidal along this direction except, at the 
intersection of the crossed dipoles, as shown 
in Fig. 1(a). Nonetheless, it remains 
interesting to note that, even for the fixed 
period, this non-uniform current distribution 
ceased to exist when the end loading was 
greatly enlarged. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the 
respective current distributions on the 
cross-dipoles and the end loading of the 
modified element at its own resonant 
frequency can change to become nearly 
uniform. This outcome implies that the 
resonant-type element (see Fig. 1(a)) is 
transformed to a lumped-type element (see 
Fig. 1(b)), even though their periods are the 
same. Only under this condition can one say 
that the equivalent circuit of this band-stop 
JC element is simply a lumped inductor in 
series with a lumped capacitor. 
Fig. 2 shows the transmittance of the 
two band-stop frequency selective surfaces 
using either element shown in Fig. 1. They 
were printed on a common FR4 substrate 
with a very thin thickness. These results were 
simulated by the full-wave finite-element 
field solver HFSS. As shown in this figure, 
the resonant frequency of the surface, using 
the lumped-type element, is much lower than 
that of the one using the resonant-type 
element. This outcome implies that the 
period of the lumped-type element can be 
greatly reduced with respect to the 
resonant-type element for a given resonant
frequency. At this point, the 
single-metal-layer lumped-type element has 
been approximately obtained. By further 
modifying this element, the final element, 
with more compact size and better 
performance according to the specification, 
can be derived. 
 
3. Experimental Results and Discussion 
 
 A newly proposed single-metal-layer 
miniaturized element can be derived from the 
lumped-type JC element obtained above. The 
geometry of the final MEFSS designed to 
resonate in the IEEE 802.11b/g/n band is 
shown in Fig. 3. The MEFSS prototype was 
made by periodically printing the element on 
the surface of a 1.6-mm-thick FR4 substrate 
with a dielectric constant 4.4 and a loss 
tangent 0.025. The MEFSS shown in Fig. 3 
is band-stop, whereas its complementary 
structure is band-pass. The pictures of both 
band-stop and band-pass MEFSS prototypes 
are shown in Fig. 4. The newly proposed 
MEFSS is not only a simple 
single-metal-layer structure, but its period is 
reduced to 8.8 percent of the free-space 
wavelength at the resonant frequency. This 
period will be reduced further if one makes 
the line width smaller. In comparison with 
the previous contributions, the periods of the 
MEFSSs proposed in [6], [7], and 
[8]—printed on the same substrate—are 20.8, 
10.4, and 8.9 percent, respectively, according 
to the same bandwidth specification and the 
same transmittance at the resonant frequency. 
Fig. 5 shows the simulated and measured 
transmittance of the newly proposed 
band-stop and band-pass MEFSSs. The 
transmittance was simulated employing the 
HFSS field solver incorporated with periodic 
boundary conditions. Here, the transmittance 
is defined as
