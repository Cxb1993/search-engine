ABSTRACT 
The first year project has accomplished research work for the development of the principles and techniques 
for adaptive beamforming with MBC using 2-D planar arrays in the presence of random sensor position errors. 
Under this situation the performance of a 2-D array beamformer is deteriorated due to the mismatch between 
the direction vectors of the desired signals and the steering vectors. We first investigate the performance 
degradation of 2-D adaptive beamforming with MBC due to random sensor position errors. Simulation results 
demonstrating the performance degradation has been carried out. Efficient methods curing the performance 
degradation due to random sensor position errors has been developed. This leads to robust techniques based 
on conventional 2-D Frost adaptive array for 2-D adaptive array beamforming with robust capabilities against 
random sensor position errors. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is demonstrated by simulation 
results. The second year project has accomplished research work for the development of the principles and 
techniques for adaptive beamforming with MBC using 2-D planar arrays in the presence of mutual coupling 
between array sensors. Based on the achievements obtained from the first-year research, we first investigate 
the performance degradation of 2-D adaptive beamforming with MBC due to mutual coupling. Simulation 
results demonstrating the performance degradation will be provided. Efficient methods curing the 
performance degradation due to mutual coupling will be developed. This leads to robust adaptive 
beamforming techniques against mutual coupling. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is 
demonstrated by simulation results. The third year project has accomplished research work for the spatial 
correlation characteristics of uniform concentric ring arrays (UCRAs) deployed in antenna systems. 
Closed-form formulas of the spatial correlation functions are derived. UCRAs with two different geometric 
structures and uniform distribution angular energy distribution are considered. It is found that the spatial 
correlation is a function of antenna sensor spacing, the geometric structure of a UCRA. Simulation results are 
presented for illustration and comparison.

CHAPTER 1 Antenna array beamforming under random sensor position 
perturbation 
一 前言: 
This paper considers antenna array beamforming under spatial information uncertainties including random 
sensor position errors and mutual coupling between antenna array sensors. We present an iterative method to 
obtain an appropriate estimate of the actual direction vector for each of the desired signals. The proposed 
method uses only the a posteriori information of the received array data. It invokes an appropriate cost 
function for estimation and solves the minimization of the cost function by using a gradient based algorithm. 
The convergence property of the proposed method is shown. Simulation results are provided for showing the 
effectiveness of the proposed method. 
 
二 研究目的與文獻探討: 
Research works regarding the design and analysis of adaptive array beamformers are widely focused on 
the situations of using an array with one-dimensional (1-D) scenario. In this case, the signal sources and the 
array elements are assumed to be coplanar. However, in many practical applications, there may exist different 
signals impinging on a 1-D array with different directions. But these signals possess the same angle with 
respect to the broadside of the 1-D array. However, a 1-D array can only distinguish the azimuth angle or the 
elevation angle also in the absence of a number of interfering signals. Moreover, it is usually impossible to 
simply extend the principles and techniques of 1-D case to deal with the mentioned problem. In these 
circumstances, we must resort to the use of adaptive beamforming with two-dimensional (2-D) array scenario. 
To achieve the goal of effectively curing the problem due to the random sensor position errors, an effective 
technique for estimating the actual direction vectors of the desired signals and an iterative scheme for 
updating the estimates during the estimation process are presented. Several simulation examples are given for 
showing the effectiveness of the proposed technique. 
The weights of an array beamformer are determined by adaptively processing the received signal data 
using spatial information. In practice, the spatial information may suffer from the random sensor position 
perturbation. This results in a mismatch between the presumed and the actual direction vectors for the desired 
signals. The performance of an array beamformer is significantly degraded by even a small mismatch [1]. 
To mitigate the effect of the spatial information uncertainties, several robust methods were recently 
developed by imposing a either spherical or ellipsoidal uncertainty constraint directly on the steering vector 
for the conventional linearly main-beam constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamforming [1-3]. These 
methods belong to the class of diagonal loading (DL) techniques which has been widely utilized to provide 
robustness against spatial uncertainty. It has been shown that this kind of ad hoc techniques usually helps to 
reduce the array sidelobes. They are robust against array steering vector errors if the diagonal loading factor 
is properly selected. However, the selection of the optimal diagonal loading factor is not clear. Moreover, it 
is somewhat difficult to find the relationship between the loading value and the level of uncertainty 
constraint or the preset level of robustness. A variable loading (VL) technique was presented by [4] to avoid 
the trade-off suffered by the DL techniques.

the broadband beamformer minimizes the variance or power of the output signal y(t) subject to some preset

Assume that [xm,ym] is the location of the mth array sensor as shown in Figure 2. ∆xm and ∆ym are the 
associated independent Gaussian random position errors with zero mean and the same variance σe
2
. From 
Figure 2, it is easy to show that the phase delay aˆ m,n(f,θp, p) of the signal with angle (θp, p ) after the nth 
delay following the mth array sensor becomes

interferers are close. We resort to an iterative procedure to solve this problem as follows. First, we rewrite (17)

where Re{ x } denotes the real part of x and the superscript * the complex conjugate. Then, we update the 
vector S and the estimate MCa

where the superscript i denotes the ith iteration and ε the preset positive step size. From (19), we note that the 
second term includes the factor of the squared norm related to each of the steering vector errors 
b(fk,θq, q)–a1(fk,θq, q), q = 1, 2, …, Q, at the ith iteration. Hence, it would be expected that the resulting 
gradient approach for finding the optimal S can provide a more appropriate estimate of S since the resulting 
step size becomes variable due to the exponential term as shown in (19). The value of the step size ε can 
influence the convergence speed of the proposed approach. In general, the proposed approach converges faster 
as ε increases due to the property of a gradient-based method. 
 
四、研究成果與討論: 
Here, three signal sources with SNRs equal to 5, 5, and 15 dB, respectively, are impinging on the array 
with size M = 9 and number of tapped delays (J−1) = 3 from direction angles (θ, ) equal to (44o, 45o), (16o, 
165
o
), and (75
o
, 300
o
), respectively. Let the specified signal be the first two with c1 =1 and the others be the 
interference. Figures 1 ~ 4 depict the simulation results including the output SINR versus the steering angle 
error with the sensor position error variance σe
2
 = 0.002λ2, the output SINR versus the power of the desired 
signals with the sensor position error variance σe
2
 = 0.002λ2 and the interferers‘ power fixed at 15 dB, the 
output SINR versus the sensor position error variance with (Δθ1,Δ 1) = (5
o
,5
o
). The results of using the VL 
method of [22] are also shown for comparison. We observe that the proposed method can effectively cope 
with the performance degradation in the case with main-beam constraint. 
In this Chapter, we have presented a method to deal with the case with random sensor position errors. A 
robust method for adaptive beamforming using a UCA against the uncertainty including random sensor 
position errors. The proposed method constructs a cost function consisting of the squared norm of the 
projection of the steering vector on the noise subspace and a constraint related to an exponential function of 
the squared norm of the corresponding phase error vector. An algorithm has been presented for the estimation 
of noise subspace. In conjunction with a gradient-based algorithm, the estimates for array response vectors of 
the desired signals can be obtained simultaneously. Simulation example has confirmed the effectiveness of the

where the superscript i denotes the ith iteration and ε the preset positive step size. From (16), we note that the 
second term includes the factor of the squared norm related to each of the steering vector errors 
b(fk,θq, q)–a1(fk,θq, q), q = 1, 2, …, Q, at the ith iteration. Hence, it would be expected that the resulting 
gradient approach for finding the optimal S can provide a more appropriate estimate of S since the resulting 
step size becomes variable due to the exponential term as shown in (16). The value of the step size ε can 
influence the convergence speed of the proposed approach. In general, the proposed approach converges faster 
as ε increases due to the property of a gradient-based method. 
 
四、研究成果與討論 
We use a UCA with the ratio of inter-element spacing d to the minimum wavelength λ of the desired 
signals equal to 0.5. The simulation results are obtained by averaging 100 independent runs with independent 
noise samples for each run. The noise received by the UCA is spatially white with variance = 1. The ε and κ 
used by the proposed method for all examples are set to 0.1 and 0.0002, respectively. The iteration procedure 
is terminated when the norm of the gradient vector ▽SJ(S) is not greater than 0.01. 
Example: We consider the case that four signal sources with SNRs equal to 5, 5, 15, and 15 dB, respectively, 
impinge on the array with size M = 9 and number of tapped delays (J − 1) = 6 from angles (θ, ) equal to (75o,

, 300
o
), (35

, 265
o
), and (55
o
, 160

), respectively. Let the desired signals be the first two with c1 = c2 
= 1 and the others be the interference. The MC matrix C of (12) is constructed by setting ZA = 73 + j 42.5 [Ω] 
and Z is given by [7]

Figure 2 depicts the simulation results including the output SINR versus the steering angle error with the 
sensor position error variance σe

 = 0.001λ2. The results of using the VL method of [4] are also shown for 
comparison. We observe that the proposed method can effectively cope with the performance degradation due 
to the considered uncertainties.                        
In this Chapter, we have presented a method to deal with the case with mutual coupling between array 
sensors. A robust method for adaptive beamforming using a UCA against the uncertainty including mutual 
coupling between array sensors. The proposed method constructs a cost function consisting of the squared 
norm of the projection of the steering vector on the noise subspace and a constraint related to an exponential 
function of the squared norm of the corresponding phase error vector. An algorithm has been presented for the

spatial correlation of array elements between the different rings demonstrates distinct characteristics due 
toarray different element placement with respect to that of the inner ring. Simulation results are provided for 
illustration and comparison. 
三 研究方法: 
In Figure 1, a general UCRA has K rings with the radius of the kth ring equal to Rk, k = 1, 2, …, K, and the 
number of elements for the kth ring equal to Nk. The total number of array elements is equal to N = N1 + N2 
+ …. +NK. The nth element of the kth ring has the location with an angle θkn = 2π(n-1)/Nk with respect to the 
reference axis, n = 1, 2, …, Nk. Moreover, the outer rings usually have more elements than the inner rings, i.e., 
N1 ≦ N2 ≦ …. ≦NK. Figure 2 shows two structures of a UCRA with two concentric rings and 8-elements 
considered in this paper. The inner ring has 4 array elements and radius equal to R1 while the outer ring has 4 
array elements and radius equal to R2. It has been shown that spatial correlation and the statistics of signal 
angular distribution are heavily related. Moreover, signal angular distribution depends on the environment of a 
wireless communication system with fading phenomenon. We consider two kinds of signal angular 
distributions in this Chapter. 
Uniform Angular Distribution model has been considered in several research papers [11-13]. The 
probability density function (PDF) of a uniform angular distribution is defined as [13] 
             P(ζ) = 1/(2Δ), for －Δ  ζ   +Δ,                                            (1) 
where   and Δ denote the mean and angle spread of the angular distribution, respectively. Truncated 
Gaussian Angular Distribution is the most common model considered by many authors for evaluating spatial 
correlation [7,11,13]. The PDF of a truncated Gaussian angular distribution is defined as [7]

In the following, the derivation of spatial correlation function for UCRA structures is presented. For 
simplicity, we consider only the azimuth plane in the geometry models. For the geometry of a UCRA shown 
in Figure 1, the array response vector of the qth signal for the kth ring, k = 1,2, …, K, is given by

四、研究成果與討論: 
Here, we present several computer simulation results based on the UCRA structure shown in Figure 2 for 
illustration and comparison. Equations (13) and (19) are used for computing the spatial correlations under a 
uniform angular distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribution, respectively. It is our simulation 
experience that equations (17) and (19) provide almost the same results when the number N of intervals is 
large enough. 
Example 1: We consider the UCRA case of Figure 2(a). Figure 3 shows the absolute values of Sc(1,6) and 
Sc(1,7) for   = 45
o
 versus R2/λ for the uniform angular distribution with various Δ and R1 set to R2/2. 
Example 2 We consider the UCRA case of Figure 2(a). Figure 4 shows the absolute values of Sc(1,6) and 
Sc(1,7) for   = 45
o
 versus R2/λ for the truncated Gaussian angular distribution with various σ and R1 set to 
R2/2 . 
Example 3: We consider the UCRA case of Figure 2(b). Figure 5 shows the absolute values of Sc(1,6) and 
Sc(1,7) for  = 45
o
 versus R2/λ for the uniform angular distribution with variousΔand R1 set to R2/2. 
Example 4: We consider the UCRA case of Figure 2(b). Figure 6 shows the absolute values of Sc(1,6) and 
Sc(1,7) for   = 45
o
 versus R2/λ for the truncated Gaussian angular distribution with various σ and R1 set to 
R2/2. 
From Figures 3 ~ 6, we observe that the spatial correlation curves for the uniform angular distribution 
with larger angular spread show a common behavior with sinc vibration. In contrast, the spatial correlation 
curves for the truncated Gaussian angular distribution are without sinc vibration. Moreover, the spatial 
correlation decreases as the angular spread increases. Hence, the output signals of the array elements are 
heavily correlated if the angular spread is very small. In this case, the diversity gain suffers from degradation. 
On the other hand, if the angular spread is rather large, the output signals of different array elements are 
weakly correlated. This leads to that better diversity gain can be obtained. As to the comparison of spatial 
correlation characteristics between the types I and II, we note that the UCRA with type II structure 
demonstrates smaller spatial correlation Sc(m,n) than that of the UCRA with type I structure for each (m,n)th 
element pair shown in the simulations. In this Chapter, we have derived the spatial correlation functions for 
two kinds of angular distribution, namely, a uniform angular distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribution, 
for the antenna systems using uniform concentric ring arrays (UCRAs). From the theoretical formulas, we can 
compute the spatial correlation for any two different elements located at any two rings of a UCRA with any 
practical standard deviation. Several simulation results have been presented for illustration and comparison.

Sampling has a rich history, dating back to Whittaker, Nyquist, Kotelnikov, Shannon and others, 
and is an active area of contemporary research with fascinating new results. The classic result of 
sampling is the one on bandlimited functions, where taking measurements at the Nyquist rate (or 
twice the maximum bandwidth) is sufficient for perfect reconstruction. These results were 
extended to shift-invariant subspaces and multiscale spaces during the development of wavelets, 
as well as in the context of splines. All these methods are based on subspace structures, and on 
linear approximation. 
Recently, non-linear methods have appeared. Non-linear approximation in wavelet spaces has 
been shown to be a powerful approximation and compression method. This points to the idea that 
functions that are sparse in a basis (but not necessarily on a fixed subspace) can be represented 
efficiently. 
The idea is even more general than sparsity in a basis, as pointed out in the framework of signals 
with finite rate of innovation. Such signals are non-bandlimited continuous-time signals, but with 
a parametric representation having a finite number of degrees of freedom per unit of time. This 
leads to sharp results on sampling and reconstruction of such sparse continuous-time signals, 
namely that 2K measurements are necessary and sufficient to perfectly reconstruct a K-sparse 
continuous-time signal. In accordance with the principle of parsimony, we call this sampling at 
Occam's rate. We indicate an order K
3
 algorithm for reconstruction, and describe the solution 
when noise is present, or the model is only approximately true. 
Next, we consider the connection to compressed sensing and compressive sampling, a recent 
approach involving random measurement matrices. This is a discrete time, finite dimensional set 
up, with strong results on possible recovery by relaxing the l_0 into l_1 optimization, or using 
greedy algorithms. These methods have the advantage of unstructured measurement matrices 
(actually, typically random ones) and therefore a certain universality, at the cost of some

cryptography. The focus is on those applications that are executed remotely or “in the cloud”, 
such as on-line recommendation services (amazon.com, Google.com) but also face-recognition 
systems. The new and exciting research area of privacy-preserving signal processing aims at 
making privacy-sensitive data of the user of such multimedia applications inaccessible by means 
of encryption. Although it is then impossible for the service provider to access directly the 
content of the encrypted data without the decryption key, the service provider can still process 
the data under encryption to perform the required task. The protocols to process the encrypted 
data are designed by using cryptographic primitives like homomorphic cryptosystems and secure 
multiparty computation techniques. I describe a number of examples that show solutions for 
privacy-preserving signal processing, including privacy-preserving face recognition and secure 
clustering.

In this paper, we have derived the three-dimensional (3-D) spatial correlation functions for 
the antenna systems using uniform concentric ring arrays (UCRAs) under a uniform angular 
distribution. Using the theoretical formulas, we can compute the 3-D spatial correlation for any 
two different elements located at any two rings of a UCRA. Simulation results have been

In this presentation, the current state of the art of models of binaural hearing will be reviewed 
and their potential regarding practical application will be discussed. Generic application areas are, 
for example, aural virtual environments, hearing aids, assessment of product-sound quality, room 
acoustics, speech technology, audio technology, robotic ears and tool for research into auditory 
physiology and perception. The talk will relate to activities of AABBA, an open international 
circle of researchers with a special interest in the application of binaural models.

rejection and multi-user detection allow increased spectral efficiency, higher throughput, more 
reliable communication, small dish antennas etc. Cooperative transmission and reception 
techniques based on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications allow reliable 
provisioning of two-way broadband, interactive and mobile applications in satellite systems. 
Ground based beamforming techniques can be applied to adapt and tailor transmission based on 
traffic and user requirements.”
