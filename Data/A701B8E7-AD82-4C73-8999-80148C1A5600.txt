1. Introduction 
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are common among computer users, with the neck and shoulder 
region being most often affected (Gerr et al., 2002; Klussmann, Gebhardt, Liebers, & Rieger, 2008). Many 
studies demonstrated increased neck-shoulder muscle activities in neck pain subjects (Bansevicius & 
Sjaastad, 1996; Falla, Bilenkij, & Jull, 2004; Hall & Quintner, 1996; G. Szeto, Straker, & O’Sullivan, 2005; 
G. P. Szeto, Straker, & O'Sullivan, 2009). Hall and Quintner (Hall & Quintner, 1996) found increased upper 
trapezius (UT) activity with sensitized neural tissue in patients with painful cervical radiculopathy. Szeto et 
al. (G. P. Szeto et al., 2009) demonstrated increased activity in the cervical erector spinae (CES) and UT 
muscles in neck pain subjects during typing tasks. Falla et al. (Falla et al., 2004) also reported subjects with 
neck pain demonstrated greater activation of accessory neck muscles during a repetitive upper limb task 
compared to healthy subjects. The gartering of neck-shoulder muscle activation may represent an altered 
pattern of muscle recruitment which compensates for reduced activation of painful muscles (Falla et al., 
2004; G. Szeto et al., 2005). On the other hand, psychological stress is thought to increase the risk of 
developing a musculoskeletal disorder in the neck-shoulder region (Waersted, 2000). Johnston et al. 
(Johnston, Jull, Darnell, Jimmieson, & Souvlis, 2008) reported the normalized EMG amplitudes of 
neck-shoulder muscles were increased during stressful typing tasks. These findings suggest an altered 
muscle recruitment pattern in neck-shoulder muscles during stressful situations. 
Working posture also has an important effect on the muscle recruitment pattern. Many studies reported a 
significant association between forward head posture during computer processing and neck pain (Chiu et al., 
2002; G. Szeto et al., 2005; Grace P. Y. Szeto, Leon M. Straker, & Peter B. O'Sullivan, 2005; Yip, Chiu, & 
Poon, 2008). Weon et al. (Weon et al., 2010) reported increased neck flexion angles were associated with 
significantly higher activity in the UT muscle. Szeto et al. (Grace P. Y. Szeto et al., 2005) suggested the 
altered muscle recruitment have a relationship with the altered kinematics. 
 
 
Fig. 1 The interaction model of neck discomfort 
According to the researches mentioned above, neck discomfort can be infected by four factors: mental 
workloads, working posture, neuromuscular physiology, and workstation (Figure 1). The aims of this 
research project are therefore to design the motor control ergonomic programs and to demonstrate the effects 
of these programs.

In this condition, subjects sit on chair in which the back support was angled backward 10°.  
 Standard typing task (standard) 
The subjects were requested to type at a comfortable pace.  
 Stressful typing task (stressful) 
Subjects were verbally encouraged to work faster and informed of the number of typing errors.  
 
2.1.3 The workstation  
A chair with adjustable height was used. In each condition, the height of seat was adjusted to the fit the 
subjects’ knees. The upper edge of the screen was 5–10° below the horizontal plane of eyes. The viewing 
distance was 400 mm. Table space in front of the keyboard was broad enough to support hands or forearms. 
The angle of elbow during typing was almost 90° (Kroemer & Grandjean, 1997). 
 
2.2 Notebook computer 
2.2.1 Subjects 
25 subjects were interviewed. An questionnaire modified from the Standard Nordic Questionnaire 
(Kuorinka et al., 1987) was used to collect information about musculoskeletal symptoms in the 
neck-shoulder region, including the right/left neck and shoulders. After the interview, six subjects were 
recruited in this study (three male and three female, age range = 20-26 years). All subjects using computer at 
least 3 hours per day, and complaint about neck-shoulder pain for at least 3 of the past 12 months. The 
anthropometric measurements of subjects were measured in accordance with ISO 7250-1: 2008. This study 
was approved by the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Board. 
 
2.2.2. Experimental procedure 
This study designed three different setting of monitor tilt angle: 100°, 115°, and 130°. All subjects worked 
for 5 min in each condition followed by 5 min breaks. The orders of these conditions were randomly 
allocated. For all conditions subjects used a 13.3 inch notebook computer (Sony VGN-SR45T). The 
notebook computer was placed on an adjustable desk with the desk height selected to let elbow flexion 
approximate to 90°. A chair with adjustable height was used, and the height of seat was adjusted to the 
match popliteal height. Before start typing, the subjects would be asked to sit upright. During typing, the 
subjects can adjust their posture until they feel the posture is suit for their. Lateral photographs were taken 
before and after each typing task. This study assessed the head flexion, neck flexion and cranio-cervical 
angle (Figure 2) through photographic analysis of visual markers placed on body landmarks (right outer 
canthus, right tragus, and C7). The camera was positioned on a tripod 80 cm from the floor and 250 cm from 
the subject, for minimize parallax error. At the beginning and the end of each typing task, the subjects are 
asked to rate their typing-related discomfort in neckshoulder regions, using a 10 cm visual analogue scale. 
Muscle activity of right cervical erector spines (CES) and upper trapezius (UT) muscles was measured by 
surface EMG. Electrodes that placed over the right CES and UT muscles were in accord with pervious paper 
(Straker, Pollock, Burgess-Limerick, Skoss, & Coleman, 2008). The signals were amplified by a 
preamplifier placed close to the electrodes and then sent to the data acquisition unit of the NeXus-10 System 
(Mind Media B.V., Netherlands) that amplified and sampled the EMG inputs at 2048 Hz. All the EMG 
signals were processed in BioTrace+ (Mind Media B.V., Netherlands) program with a band-pass filtered at 
20–500 Hz. Then the signals were down-sampled to 10 Hz RMS (root-mean-square). The EMG amplitude 
was normalized to maximum voluntary contraction (MVC, see Table 2) (G. P. Y. Szeto et al., 2005a).

3.1 Desktop computer 
Figure 3 showed the mean values of summed discomfort scores. There were significant differences 
between the case group and control group in all four typing conditions (all p＜0.05). Both subject groups 
have decreased summed discomfort scores in the backward sitting posture, although only the case group 
showed a significant difference (p＜ 0.1) under the standard typing condition. Comparing the 
upright-stressful condition with the backward-standard condition, there was a significant difference in the 
case group; however, there was still no significant difference with the control group. 
Figure 4 summarized the normalized EMG data of the CES and UT. Although no significant difference 
was found, these results show the UT muscle activity in the case group was higher than the control group; 
compared with the standard typing condition, both of these two groups showed increased muscle activity of 
CES and UT under stressful typing conditions; compared with upright sitting posture, both subjects groups 
have deceased muscle activity of CES and UT in the backward sitting posture. When comparing the 
backward-standard condition with the upright-stressful condition, there were significant differences in CES 
and UT muscle activities of case group (all p＜0.05); however,  significant difference were only 
demonstrated in CES muscle activities of  the control group (p＜0.1).

4. Discussion  
4.1 Desktop computer 
This study compared four typing conditions to investigate the interaction effect of sitting posture and 
psychological stress on neck-shoulder muscle activities and summed discomfort scores. The results showed 
the backward sitting posture tends to decrease the muscle activities of neck-shoulder muscles, and the 
stressful typing condition tends to increase muscle activities. When comparing the upright-stressful with 
backward-standard, significant differences were found in the summed discomfort scores and normalized 
EMG amplitudes in case group.  
Previous studies reported the symptom of pain, psychological stress and working posture all have 
significant effects on the muscle recruitment pattern (Johnston, Jimmieson, Souvlis, & Jull, 2007; Johnston 
et al., 2008; G. Szeto et al., 2005; G. P. Szeto et al., 2009; Grace P. Y. Szeto et al., 2005; Weon et al., 2010; 
10 
 
results suggest the monitor tilt angle at 100°-130° probably provides no significant advantage or 
disadvantage to CES and UT.  
In conclusion, this study suggested the backward sitting posture is the prefer working posture for neck 
pain subjects during typing task, especially in psychologically stressful situations. The interaction effect of 
posture and stress also significant changed the muscle activities of CES in healthy subjects. However, no 
significant influences were found on subjective discomfort in the healthy subjects. Moreover, results from 
this study show the neck pain subjects in different monitor tilt angle settings create different type of 
head-neck posture and different level of self reported discomfort. The significant less craio-cervical angle 
and self report discomfort was note in the condition that set the monitor tilt angle at 130°.
