and a large magnetization anisotropy constant (K1=
1.45×107 ergs/cm3). Despite the disadvantage of this alloy,
namely the limited stability of the L10 phase, it is possible
both to extend the stability range of the L10 martensite and
to improve the softness of the Fe-Pd alloys with the addi-
tion of a third alloy element. Addition of the third element
can usually induce a strong influence on the L10 marten-
sitic transformation [3]. Therefore, in this study, we select
Ag as the third alloy element for the Fe-Pd alloys. The L10
martensitic transformation and magnetic property of the
composition Fe-30Pd-4Ag alloys are investigated in the
present work.
II. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
The Fe-30Pd-4Ag (at%) alloys were formed by melt-
ing by pure electrolytic iron (99.9%), pure palladium
(99.95%), and pure silver (99.95%) in an arc vacuum fur-
nace under a controlled protective argon atmosphere. The
cast ingots were sealed in evacuated quartz capsules and
homogenized at 1050C for 60 hours and subsequently
forged to a thickness of 2~3mm. After forging, the speci-
mens were sliced and sealed in evacuated quartz capsules
again and solution treated (ST) at 950C for 1.5 hours be-
fore being quenched in ice water. The aging treatment was
performed in the temperatures range of 400-550C for
various amounts of time. Thin foils for TEM were pre-
pared by double jet electropolishing in a solution contain-
ing 82% acetic acid, 9% perchloric acid, and 9% methanol
at a temperature in the range of -7C~10C using a current
density of 2A/cm2 to 4A/cm2. Transmission electron mi-
croscopy (TEM), with a double tilt stage, was performed
in an analytical type high resolution electron microscope
(Hitachi HF-2000) with a field emission gun operated at
200 kV, and a JEM-2100F operated at 200 kV, respec-
tively. The X-ray diffraction patterns were detected at
room temperature using an X-ray diffractometer (Siemens
D5000 Karlsruhe) with Cu-Kradiation, and diffraction
angles were in the 2ranges from 35to 140. The mart-
ensitic phase transformation temperatures of the samples
that were only solution treated and those that were solution
treated and then thermally aged were determined with dif-
ferential scanning calorimetry (2920 MDSC V2.6A). A
temperature range from -50 to 220 was scanned at a rate℃
of 10 /min during heating. (i.e., The samples were℃
scanned in a temperature range from -50 to 220 at a℃
heating rate of 10 /min).℃ The magnetic property zero-
field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) measurements
were carried out with a superconducting quantum inter-
ference device (SQUID) magnetometer. The temperature
dependence of mass susceptibility (where= M/H,=
density) measurements on samples cooled under 20000 Oe
were made in the temperature range from 0 K to 350 K by
induction method.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. γfcc phase transformation into the monoclinic L1m
phase+L10 structure observed by TEM
Figure 1(a) shows an essential transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) selected area diffraction pattern (SADP)
with zone axis [011]L10//[23 2]L1m of the Fe-30Pd-4Ag
alloy solution treated (ST) at 950C for 1.5 h and
quenched in ice water (hkl denotes the ordered L10 phase;
hkl denotes the monoclinic L1m structure). On the basis of
the diffraction pattern analysis, a dim satellite spot beside
the {200}L10 position can be seen in the SADP micrograph,
an indication that the as-quenched γfcc phase separation
into the L10 structure should be a weak first ordering reac-
tion [4-5]. This first ordering reaction begins during the
solution treatment (ST) and quenching in ice water. Figure
1(b) is a dark field (DF) image formed using the (11 1)L10
reflection corresponding to Fig. 1(a). In this image, the
first ordered L10 structure, in bright contrast with a
twinned structure (tetragonal), can be distinctly observed
in the early phase transition. Figure 1(c) is a dark field (DF)
image formed using the (221)L1m monoclinic reflection
corresponding to Fig. 1(a). The DF image of Fig. 1(c) re-
veals that the initial intermediate L1m monoclinic phases

is shown in Fig. 3(a), in which reflections of two phases
(101)L1m and (111)L10 are the main diffraction peak. The
(111)and (110)bct peaks also appear; in addition, there is
an observable (011)L1m peak in the X-ray diffraction pat-
tern. The X-ray experiment results exhibit that an interme-
diate structure appears between the fcc → L10 martensitic
transformation, which occurs in the early ST treatment.
Simultaneously, the X-ray experiment also demonstrates
that the addition of silver (Ag) to the Fe-Pd alloy system
enhances the L1m and L10 phase formation. When the alloy
is aged at 400C for 100 h, many adaptive L1m monoclinic
structures and ordered L10 martensitic phases appear in the
X-ray diffraction patterns, in addition to the (111)phase
separation to the (110)bct+L1m+L10 structures, as shown
in Fig. 3(b). It is also interesting to note that the X-ray
diffraction peak for the plane (002)L10, (202)L10, (113)L10
reflections corresponding to the ST specimen in Fig. 3(a)
have been transformed into the tetragonal splitting peak
(200)L10;(002)L10, (220)L10;(202)L10, and (131)L10;(113)L10
reflections when the specimen has been aged at 475C for
111 h, as shown in Fig. 3(c). These splitting peaks are the
result of the formation of the completely ordered tetrago-
nal L10 martensitic structures attendant on the L1m → L10
phase transformation reaction. Comparison of the L10
tetragonal splitting peaks of Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) reveals that
the axial ratio c/a of the ordered L10 martensite gradually
decreased when the aging temperature was lowered to
400C. On the other hand, the degree of tetragonality de-
velops as the specimen is aged at a lower temperature of
400C, in which case it gives rise to an increase in the
anisotropy and enhances the magnetic coercivity in the
Fe-Pd-Ag alloy [9-11].
3. Martensite L10 phase transformation temperature
Martensitic L10 phase transformation temperatures of
the specimen ST at 950℃ for 1.5 h and quenched in ice
water were determined by differential scanning calo-
rimetry (DSC). The results are shown in Fig. 4(a). Two
distinct peaks in the heating direction are observed, indi-
cating a two-step phase transition [12-13]. The first endo-
thermic peak in the heating direction corresponds to the
superposition of the L1m (monoclinic phase)+A (austenite
structure) with L1ms = 24.86℃, L1mf = 52℃, As = 28℃,
and Af = 54℃. The subscript “s”denotes the temperature
at which the phase transformation starts, and the “f”de-
notes the temperature at which the phase transition finishes.
The second DSC peak (i.e., the exothermic peak) corre-
sponding to the second ordered L10 martensite phase is
determined to have transformation temperatures ML10s =
183℃ and ML10f = 204℃ (here ML10s denotes the second
ordered L10 martensite phase transition start). The DSC
study indicates the martensitic phase transition during
heating as follows; a weak first ordered L10 martensite → 
L1m (monoclinic phase) → A (austenite structure) → sec-
ond ordered L10 martensite. From the DSC chart, it is in-
ferred that the L1m phase transforms to second ordered L10
martensite in addition to the direct transformation from A
(austenite) to second ordered L10 martensite during heat-
ing of the sample. Figure 4(b) shows a DSC heating curve
of a specimen ST and then thermally aged at 475℃ for
111 h. The DSC chart reveals two endothermic peaks and
one exothermic peak during heating. This is referred to as
a three-step transformation on heating [14-15]. Two endo-
thermic peaks correspond to the L1m (monoclinic phase)
and A (austenite structure) with L1ms = 12.5℃, L1mf = 18
℃, As = 19.4℃, and Af = 37.5℃, respectively. The one
exothermic peak indicating the second ordered L10 mart-
ensite phase was determined to have transformation tem-
peratures ML10s = 156℃ and ML10f = 162.5℃. Compari-
son of the DSC chart of Fig. 4(a) with Fig. 4(b) indicates
that when the specimen was ST and then thermally aged at
475℃ for 111 h (Fig. 4(b)), the phase transition tempera-
tures of the L1m (monoclinic structure), the A (austenite
phase), and the second ordered L10 martensite phase
transformation moved toward the lower temperature, con-
current with the transition heat flow peak intensity also
decreasing. An intermediate structure appearing between
the fcc → L10 martensitic transformation, confirmed by TEM

analysis, it can be inferred that the rhodium atoms
moved, agglomerating along the grain boundary on
the deformed {101} plane, as the alloys were
strain-forged to produce a 40% reduction in
thickness. Owing to recrystallization and grain
growth being one type of atom diffusion mechanism,
the higher melting point (1966 ) of Rh℃ , with its
higher activation energy and slower diffusion rate,
leads to the retention of the square Rh-enriched nano
particle in the grain boundary. The pinning of the
grain growth by the Rh-enriched nano particles can
be reasonably demonstrated as a possible source of
the ultra fine grain sizes of the alloys resulting from
deformation and annealing recrystallization. These
ultra fine grain sizes enhance the ductility of the
FSMA Fe-30Pd-2Rh (at%) for use in
magneto-mechanical applications. Figure 2(a) shows
alloys strain-forged to a 40% reduction in thickness,
thermally annealed at 1050 for 1.5 h℃ , and
quenched in ice brine. This figure also reveals ultra
fine grains that were generated by recrystallization.
A corresponding enlarged SEM micrograph of the
ultra fine grains is shown in Fig. 2(b). The
rectangular Rh-enriched nano particle pinning the
grains is indicated by the arrow. The EDS spectra
showing Rh-enriched content, taken from the
rectangular nano particle (in (b), marked with), are
shown in Fig. 2(c), and the EDS spectra showing
Rh-depleted content, taken from the ultra fine grain
structure (in (b), marked with ), are shown in Fig.
2(d). Comparing the two spectra, a great disparity in
rhodium is found. The intensity of rhodium content
in the rectangular nano particle is markedly higher

after recrystallization through annealing at 1050 ℃ for 1.5
h; (b) higher magnification of the ultra fine grains; (c) EDS

(3.67 at% Rh), as demonstrated in Fig. 2(c). It is also
interesting to note that the square Rh-enriched nano
particle apparently grew into a rectangular
Rh-enriched nano particle as the annealing
temperature increased to 1050 ℃/1.5 h. Figure 3
represents the x-ray diffraction patterns of the alloys
strain-forged to a (~40%) reduction in thickness, in
which reflections of two phases, (211)L1m and
(202)L10, are the main diffraction peaks. The x-ray
results show that the strain-forged specimen induces
the fcc → L10+L1m phase transition, and the strain
with L10 martensite nuclei lying on the {202} or
(101) plane of the strain matrix causes the main peak
(202)L10 to be observable in the x-ray diffraction
patterns.
Conclusion
Investigation with scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) reveals that square or rectangular
Rh-enriched nano particles are heterogeneously
distributed along the grain boundary when
strain-forged specimens are annealed at 950℃/3h or
1050℃/1.5h and quenched in ice brine. The pinning
of grain growth by the Rh-enriched nano particles
can be reasonably inferred as a possible contributor
to the ultra fine grain sizes of the alloys, resulting
from a strain-forged (~40%) reduction in thickness
with subsequent recrystallization through thermal
annealing. The ultra fine grain size (< ASTM G.S.10
#) provides improved ductility in FSM Fe-30Pd-2Rh
alloys for use in magneto-mechanical applications.
