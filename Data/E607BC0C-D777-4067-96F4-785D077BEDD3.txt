二、 英文摘要
The aim of this study was to determine the
relative contribution of changes in restorative
material, cavity dimensions, adhesive layer
adaptation, and load conditions on the
biomechanical response of an adhesive Class II
MOD restoration during oral temperature changes.
A validated finite-element (FE) model was used to
perform the structural-thermal coupled field
analyses and the Taguchi method was employed to
identify the significance of each design factor in
controlling the stress. The results indicated that
thermal expansion in restorative material amplified
the thermal effect and dominated the tooth stress
value (69%) at high temperatures. The percentage
contributions of the load conditions, cavity depth,
and cement modulus increased the effect on tooth
stress values 46, 32, and 14%, respectively, when
the tooth temperature was returned to 37°C. Load
conditions were also the main factor influencing
the resin cement stress values, irrespective of
temperature changes. Increased stress values
occurred with composite resin, lateral force, a
deeper cavity, and a higher luting cement modulus.
Conclusions: The combined use of FE analysis and
the Taguchi method efficiently identified that a
deeper cavity might increase the risk of a restored
tooth fracture, as well as a ceramic inlay with a
lower thermal expansion, attaining a proper
occlusal adjustment to reduce the lateral occlusal
force and low modulus luting material application
to obtain a better force-transmission mechanism are
recommended.
Keywords: finite element analysis; thermal; Taguchi
method; MOD restoration; biomechanics.
三、 緣由與目的
The structural integrity of a tooth can be
compromised by hard tissue loss caused by caries,
abrasions, cracks, or restoration failure. Losses of
tooth structure from the previously mentioned
conditions require a restoration to approach the
tooth's original strength. Dental restoration
involves consideration of both the remaining
biological tissue structure and the type of
4Class II MOD restoration.
四、 材料與方法
Factorial design
Restorative material, three cavity dimension
design variables (pulpal wall depth, isthmus width,
and thickness of the interaxial dentin), resin cement
thickness, and property and load conditions were
selected as the seven restorative consideration
factors for evaluating the adhesive Class II MOD
premolar restoration biomechanics. Each factor was
assigned two levels (Table 1). CAD/CAM ceramic
block (Vita Mark II; Vita Zahnfabrik, Germany) and
heat-cured resin composite (Gradia; GC, Japan)
were selected as the two different aesthetic
restorative materials. The cavity depth was defined
as the ratio of the pulpal wall depth (from the
buccal cusp; P) to the gingival wall depth (CH; Fig.
1a). One-half and 3/4 ratios were varied for cavity
depth design. The cavity isthmus width parameter
was defined as the ratio of the actual isthmus width
(IW) to the intercuspal width (CW; Fig. 1a). Two
ratios, 1/2 and 2/3, of the isthmus width were
investigated. Two variations of the interaxial
thickness examined were termed as 1/2 and 1/3
thickness (fractions were the ratio of T/MD, as
shown in Fig. 1b). Uniform 50 μm and 100 μm
thick layers and two different modulus of resin
cement were set to model the adhesive layer
adaptation. Axial and lateral concentration forces
were simulated as the load conditions. To identify
the relative importance of the design factors using a
full factorial approach, a total number of total
number 128 analyses (27) were required. In this
study, a statistics-based Taguchi method was used
to reduce the number of analyses. Only eight
simulations (orthogonal array L8) were required.
The configurations of multi-factorial restorative
considerations for the adhesive Class II MOD
premolar restoration are shown in an orthogonal
array L8 in Table 2.
FE model generation and validation
In sound tooth solid model generation, a
maxillary upper second premolar plaster model
(Tung Sheng International Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) on
a scale of one-to-five was restored for the external
shape definition using the reverse engineering
technique. Over two million surface points were
obtained at 0.1 mm increments using four axes
(mesial-distal, buccal-lingual, occlusal axis, and
rotation of the occlusal axis) laser scanning (3D
Family Technology Co., Ltd, Taiwan) and 24
profiles along the radial direction from the central
fossa to the apical root at 15 degree increments and
collected and assembled in a 3D wire-frame
structure using a 3D CAD system (Pro/Engineer
2001; Parametric Technology Co., Waltham, MA,
USA; Figs. 2a and 2b). The 3D curves were
exported in ANSYS, version 11.0 (Swanson
Analysis Inc., Houston, PA, USA) to create the
volume by fitting the radial profiles. The enamel
and dentin volumes were defined according to the
literature data on the tooth morphology and
subsequently generated by scaling the outer crown
geometry. The pulpal region was obtained in an
analogous way and subtracted from the volume to
finish the sound premolar solid model. Based on the
outer geometry of the solid model, volumes were
then created to model the periodontal ligament
(PDL; 0.25 mm) and alveolar bone (cortical and
cancellous). According to the definition of two
different cavity dimensions and resin cement
thicknesses in Table 1, two MOD preparation
designs were generated using a parametric cutting
plane in the sound maxillary premolar. To prevent
quantitative differences in the stress values in the
models, all solid models were derived from a single
mesh pattern that generated 205720 linear
four-node structural solid elements (solid92 in
ANSYS) and 283572 nodes (Figs. 2c-2f ).
A model designed with trial number 1 in Table
2 was simulated to validate the reliability of the FE
model. Axial load was applied on the tooth at two
points on the cusps with 200N resulting in force
crossing the central position. The load application
points and directions were modeled in accordance
with a load test set-up following our validated
experiment. The exterior nodes at the mesial, distal,
and bottom surfaces of the alveolar bone were fixed
in all directions as the boundary conditions. Linear
and elastic enamel, dentin, pulp, ceramic, resin
cement, and epoxy resin (instead of PDL and
alveolar bone) material properties were assigned
according to the volume definition from the
literature (Table 3).
A compression test was performed to validate
the FE model. Five freshly extracted intact
maxillary second premolars were prepared
according to the definition with trial number 1 in
Table 2, the CAD/CAM ceramic restorations were
fabricated following the CEREC 3 (Sirona,
Bensheim, Germany) standard restoration
procedure and adhesively luted with Unifil Flow
(GC, Japan). A strain gage (Kyowa; Electronic
Instruments Co., Ltd., Japan) with 120Ω reference 
resistance was glued onto the critical tooth surface
point positioned at the middle (from cusp tip to
cervical CEJ) of the buccal surface at the midline to
record the strains. The samples were then embedded
from the root to 1 mm below the CEJ into an epoxy
resin block (Truetime Industrial Co., Taiwan) and
6Results regarding the main effects at each level for
maximum principal stresses on the remaining tooth
and resin cement and relative importance of the
investigated factors at times 1, 8, and 35 s are
presented in Figs. 3, 4 and in Table 5, respectively.
With respect to the stress values in the remaining
tooth, relative importance for investigated factors
at temperature 51°C (1 s), 44°C (8 s), and 37°C (35
s) had different trends. The restorative material
(69%), load condition (15%), cavity pulpal wall
depth (7%), and resin cement modulus (7%)
determined the magnitude of the stress values at
high temperature (51°C) at time 1 s (Table 5).
Other investigated factors (cavity isthmus width,
interaxial thickness, and resin cement thickness)
influenced the stress values slightly and the total
percentage contributions of these parameters were
only 2% (Table 5). However, the percentage
contributions of the load conditions and cavity
depth increased gradually with a decrease in tooth
temperature. In contrast, the relative importance of
restorative material became unimportant when the
tooth temperature returned to 37°C (mouth
temperature). At this temperature, the load
condition (46%) and cavity depth (32%) were the
most important factors affecting the remaining
stress values. Combining the main effect plots for
the remaining tooth stresses in Fig. 3, composite
resin restorative material, cavity pulpal wall depth
with ratio as 3/4, higher luting cement modulus,
and lateral load (load case 2) acting at the lingual
cusp substantially increased the stress values, no
matter how the temperature varied. The main effect
of the luting cement thickness, cavity isthmus
width, and cavity interaxial thickness had no
significant effect for the tooth stress values.
For the resin cement stress values, the results
indicated that the cavity pulpal wall depth and the
load condition increased the relative significance
from 24% to 30 % and 41% to 48% with decreasing
tooth temperatures, respectively. In contrast, the
percentage contributions of the resin cement
modulus decreased from 27 to 18% with a decrease
in tooth temperature from 51 to 37°C (Table 5). The
main effect plots had similar trends with the
remaining tooth and also showed that lateral load
(load case 2), cavity pulpal wall depth with ratio of
3/4, and higher luting cement modulus increased
the stress values (Fig. 4).
The stress concentration location for the
simulation models was also determined. The stress
concentration regions for the remaining tooth and
resin cement were dependent on the load condition,
irrespective of the other investigated factors. The
maximum stress distributions for the remaining
tooth and resin cement for load case 1 (axial), both
concentrated at the top of the buccal walls, are
shown in Figs. 5a and 5b. The corresponding
locations for the remaining tooth and resin cement
for load case 2 (lateral) were both at the top of the
lingual walls (Figs. 5c and 5d).
六、 討論
The role of the filling material, cavity
dimension, adhesive resin cement, load conditions,
and oral environment (temperature change) was
clearly demonstrated and the results indicated
various important points to observe to obtain high
performance of the restoration itself. Unfortunately,
multi-factorial interactions among the
above-mentioned factors have not yet been
elucidated, especially when considering the thermal
effect induced by tooth temperature varying. Solely
clinical or experimental approaches are appropriate
for exploring restoration strength with a variation
of a single factor, but are difficult to perform in
multiple tests with multi-factorial variables.
Therefore, reverse engineering and CAD
techniques were integrated, first to generate more
accuracy of FE models of MOD-restored teeth, and
then to investigate the mechanical interactions of
the multi- restorative factors under different oral
temperatures.
Although a plaster premolar model was
scanned using laser beams to obtain the external
shape and internal structure definition, our
premolar FE model was reasonable and reliable as
a result of the buccal surface strain error between
the experimentally-measured and
numerically-calculated was within 10%. Also, a
standard plaster premolar was used to construct the
model because large sample variations in selecting
a natural premolar and preventing loss of natural
tooth cusp geometry by stacking thick cutting
sections or computer tomography (CT) images. A
similar model construction procedure was done by
Ausiello in 2004.
FE analysis has been used widely and
accepted as a complementary tool for
understanding the detailed mechanical responses
for many biologic investigations, but few attempts
have been made to assess the sensitivity of the
model to variations in the input parameters or
possible interactions between these parameters. Dar
et al. suggested that the usefulness of the Taguchi
method in the field of biomechanical FE is
apparent, and that using the Taguchi method
correctly should result in a more realistic model of
both natural and synthetic systems and a better
assessment of the sensitivity of a model to the input
parameters. In this study, we used the Taguchi
method combined with FE structural-thermal

二、 與會心得
本次所發表的論文是利用電腦輔助工程分析及品質工程分析法技術探討牙科
矯正迷你植體之設計，就電腦模擬分析技術而言，此技術雖已逐漸成為研究生物力
學最重要的工具之一，但一般的研究常會忽略合理的邊界條件、材料分佈及幾何外
形等因素，進而嚴重影響到分析結果的準確性，且當探討參數眾多時便會限制此法
的應用，因此本研究將利用田口統計方法來降低實驗組數並且預測出一組最佳之設
計參數，利用 L18 直交表進行分析，即可將 18 組參數來預測兩千多組參數，進而計
算各種不同設計之迷你植體植入在顎骨下之生物力學行為，研究結果顯示矯正初期
時骨釘周邊骨質骨整合與否對於植入後穩定性並無顯著之影響，因此即可術後立即
施予骨釘負載，而材質建議以不鏽鋼較為理想。本研究由於結合統計方法及電腦模
擬分析來找出最佳化設計，因此吸引不少感興趣的讀者前來討論。整體而言雖然本
研究的工程模擬技術已較以往的研究進步，但有學者指出為何僅選用田口法而不使
用其他統計方法，且田口法預測出之結果並未與實際體外實驗比對，實為本研究有
待改進之處。
在整個與會的過程中，學生大都鎖定在電腦分析的研究領域中聽講，從彼此交
流的過程中，發現國外學者對我們的分析技術及模型建構方法十分有興趣，且對於
本次發表田口方法應用於多參數之電腦模擬分析上相當感興趣，也藉由討論得到不
錯之建議。然而如何將工程技術有效的與醫學領域相結合或研究目標更符合臨床需
求則是值得深思的問題。
三、 考察參觀活動
無
四、 建議
學生發現我國的工程技術（電腦輔助分析、設計）在牙科生物力學的領域已有
相當的水準，但整體研究目標、邏輯思考及臨床應用則明顯不足，在足夠的工程技
術背後常常發生不知要如何解決臨床所遇到的問題，因此今後應要多和臨床醫師討
論，也要加強和國外合作推動研究，因為國內在醫學工程（臨床與工程）的整體配
合研究仍嫌不足，因此在尖端醫工研究上，還是需要與國外進一步的整合，才能大
力提昇研究水準。
