non-linear relationship and change from R a t1 to R a t1/2. It is an indication that such peculiar 
dendritic morphology is due to the diffusion limited aggregation. POM with tint plate is also used to 
analyze the dendritic morphology of PEO/TA=70/30. It shows different colors between the main 
trunk and the branches (red and blue) which are attributed to the different lamellar orientation 
between the main trunks and branches (edge-on and flat-on).

INTRODUCTION 
For most semicrystalline polymers, it is generally accepted that spherulites are essentially 
spherical aggregation of anisotropic crystalline lamellae that emanate from a common central 
nucleus.  Microfibrils aggregate first form bundles, and then continuous splaying apart and 
occasional branching of lamellae, until a fully grown spherical shape is attained and often impinge 
with neighboring spherulites.1  Spherulites usually display a Maltese-cross pattern under a 
polarized optical microscope due to the orientation of the crystal chains.  Nevertheless, in some 
vinyl polymers (e.g., polyethylene; or poly(vinylidene fluoride)),2-5 the Maltese-cross pattern can be 
seen along with extinction rings, namely ringed spherulites.  Interestingly, in certain other 
polymers, Maltese-cross pattern is not seen in spherulites, but instead, extinction ring patterns are 
clearly seen.  Such examples of rings with no Maltese-cross in spherulites can be seen in several 
aryl-polyesters,2,6-8 as well as some other polymers.9-13  Ring-bands and mechanisms of formation 
of ring-bands have been widely discussed in the literature.1~5,14~21  Interpretation is that rings may 
be attributed to cooperative twisting of the lamellae along the direction of radial growth; however, 
relevant mechanisms and relationships between lamellar twisting and rings are still controversial.  
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), have been studied 
extensively on their thermal behavior, mechanical properties, and crystal structures.14~16,22,23  
Recently, poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) has also attracted much attention owing to its 
excellent mechanical properties.7  More recently, we have observed interesting ringed patterns in 
poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) melt-crystallized at temperature ranging from 150 to 
215°C.18  Ring-bands in spherulites have been reported in PTT or its miscible blends, where the 
stacked lamellae assume a flat-on and an edge-on orientation in the dark and bright regions, 
respectively, leading to formation of a ringed morphology.18,19  On the other hand, ring-banded 
spherulites have rarely been reported in PET or faster-crystallizing PBT.  Some exceptions are 
seen in PET, where occasionally solution-cast PET can exhibit irregularly ordered ring bands, but 
melt-crystallized PET never displays ring bands in spherulites.  Aryl polyesters with long 
methylene goups, such as poly(pentamethylene terephthalate) (PPT), poly(hexamethylene 
terephthalate) (PHT), poly(pentamethylene terephthalate) (PHepT), etc., have been less studied 
owing to limited application interests.  For PPT, it is known that two distinct crystal forms (a and 
b) can co-exist in oriented forms; in particular, a structure transformation from a form to b form for 
PPT has also been found.20,21  Both a and b forms of PPT are characterized by triclinic chain 
packing, differing only in the c-axis.  But typically only the a-crystal cell is seen in PPT 
crystallized/annealed under zero or small tensions.  The b-crystal is formed under either high 
tensions or strained at constant length.20,21  Similar crystal transformation can also be observed in 
poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT).15,16  By comparison, PPT, with one more methylene unit than 
PBT, has been less studied.  Little is known about PPT, except that an equilibrium Tm0 value of 
149.4°C of PPT has been reported,24 which is significantly much lower than that of PBT.  PBT is 
not known to crystallize into ring-banded spherulites under most conditions; by contrast, PPT easily 
crystallizes into ring-banded spherulites.24  Similarly, PHT is not known to crystallize into

usually of low regularity with highly zig-zag patterns; however, blending of miscible diluents with 
PCL tends to change the patterns of spherulites.  PCL spherulites in neat PCL have been reported 
to be distinctly different from those in miscible PCL/poly(benzyl methacrylate) (PBzMA) and PCL/ 
poly(phenyl methacrylate) (PPhMA) blends58,59. Ring bands become more distinct and orderly in 
miscible PCL blends with amorphous polymers, and ring bands can usually form at lower Tc’s in 
blends than neat PCL, owing to either depressed Tm or elevated Tg in blends by presence of the 
amorphous polymer.  In this study, PCL and its blends composed of different amorphous polymers 
were chosen as models for comparative studies on relationships between kinetic regimes and 
spherulite patterns.  They were targeted for such study objectives for comparative reasons probing 
effects of types of miscible diluents on growth rates and patterns of crystals developed.   
    The spherulitic morphologies and the crystallization kinetics of PEO and PEO/amorphous 
polymer blends have been studied in past decades.60-64  For the PEO/amorphous polymer blends, 
the spherulite morphologies are quite different among those with or without strong intermolecular 
interactions.65-71 PEO/poly(n-buytyl methacrylate) (PnBMA),65 PEO/poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc),66 
PEO/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)66 and PEO/poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)67 are miscible 
blends with weak intermolecular interaction, and their spherulite morphologies are similar to neat 
PEO. The spherulite growth rates of these blends are constant with respect to time for all blend 
compositions. In contrast, for miscible blends with strong intermolecular interaction, like 
PEO/styrene-hydroxystyrene copolymer (SHS),66 PEO/poly(p-vinyl phenol) (PVPh),68 
PEO/4,4’-diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS),68,69 PEO/unsaturated polyester resin (PER)70 and 
PEO/hydroquinine,71 the spheruite morphologies in these blends become feather-like or dendritic 
with increasing contents of the amorphous polymer in blends.  Stronger interactions between a 
crystallizing species and an amorphous polymer tend to depress the rate of crystallization more 
significantly.  Besides, the spherulite radii are nonlinear with respect to time.66,69

without further purification.  HPLC-grade solvents were used for blend preparation.  Structure of 
TA is shown in Scheme 2, which reveals a macromolecular aromatic ester with two or three –OH 
group on each of the benzene rings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                         
Scheme 2: Tannic Acid (Tannin) 
The polymers were first weighed, respectively, and dissolved into solvent (4%) with 
continuous stirring with a magnetic bar.  Subsequently, the resulting polymer solution was poured 
into a flat aluminum or glass mold at room temperature.  All solution-cast blend samples were 
finally subjected to a vacuum oven at 40oC for 7 days to ensure complete removal of residual 
solvent. The film thickness was ca. 2~3mm.  
 
Apparatus 
 Tg transitions of the blend samples were measured with a differential scanning calorimeter 
(DSC-7, Perkin-Elmer) equipped with an intracooler (to -60oC) and data acquisition/analysis. 
Additional sub-ambient DSC runs (temperature as low as -100oC) were cooled with a liquid 
nitrogen tank and helium gas purge.  Prior to DSC runs, the temperature and heat of transition of 
the instrument were calibrated with indium and zinc standards.  During thermal annealing or 
scanning, a continuous nitrogen flow in the DSC sample cell was maintained to ensure minimal 
sample degradation. 
Radial growth of spherulites was recorded and rates measured using a polarized optical 
microscopy (POM, Nikon Optiphot-2) equipped with a temperature-controlled hot stage and a 
Nikon charge-coupled device (CCD) digital camera and automatic image processing software. 
Samples were also used for scanning electron microscope (SEM, Philips XL-40FEG)

Kg can be estimated from the slopes of suitable plots. With the values of Kg determined, other 
parameters could be estimated. 
The analysis through the calculation of Lauritzen-Hoffman equation shows in Figure 2 
according to Eq. 2 with various U* values, where data were obtained at temperature (Tc) of 
isothermal crystal growth by varying from 106 to 126oC at 2~3oC step. In this plot, apparently, 
growth patterns following Regime III and regime II of different slopes are presented. The 
intersection of two straight lines with the discontinuity was calculated to be near Tc=118.4oC, which 
agrees reasonably well with the intersection point shown in the previous figure. Kg could be 
obtained from slopes of plots in this figure for regime III and II, respectively. Some physical 
constants for POT were needed. Equilibrium Tmo of POT was obtained from extrapolation by the 
classical Hoffman-Weeks method, and ΔHfo is the enthalpy of fusion per unit volume of a perfect 
and infinitely large crystal lamellae at its Tm. Table 1 shows summary of results of the ratios of 
Kg(III)/ Kg(II) for different values of U* used. For the use of U*= 1500 cal/mol, Kg(III)/ Kg(II) = 
2.16 is resulted, which is the closest to theoretical value of 2.0 according to predictive requirement 
of Kg(III) = 2 Kg(II). Temperature at the discontinuity (i.e., transition from Regime-II to -III) is 
118.4oC (TII→III).  
 
1.2 Correlation Between Growth Regime and Spherulite Patterns 
   There seems a systematic change in spherulite patterns as the temperature changes in ascending 
schemes, in which the growth transits from Regime-III to II. Figure 3 and the inset POM 
photographs show the various spherulite patterns corresponding to Regime III and II, respectively. 
Clear and regular ring-bands with good order are apparent in Regime-III, from 106 to 117oC, and 
the ring band width increases correspondingly. Note that Regime-III can be further extended to 
temperature below 106oC to 70oC, in which dual types of spherulites (ring-banded and ringless ones) 
grow in a rapid speed and coexist with various fractions. This will be discussed later. In Regime-II 
(120~126oC), the ring patterns persist, but they become more rugged or zig-zag, and of less order, 
and the regularity of the rings decreases with further temperature increased. That is, in Regime-II, 
the ring-band pattern still is recognizable in the spherulites, only with the inter-ring space increasing 
and regularity decreasing dramatically. The intersection point between Regime III and Regime II is 
about 118.4oC. Apparently, in both Regime III and II, POT spherulites are characterized with 
extinction ring bands of various inter-ring width (or spacing), but regularity of the ring bands 
transforms from a regular concentric and closely-spaced pattern in Regime-III to a zig-zag pattern 
with larger inter-ring space in Regime-II. This transition in POT is opposite to that in 
poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) reported earlier by Hong et al,37 who have concluded that 
growth in Regime-III correlates with ring-bands while growth in Regime-II correlates with ring-less 
Maltese-cross spherulites in PTT. But for POT, both regimes produce extinction-ring spherulites;

that for spherulites with double-rings under non-polarized OM, the inter-ring space is twice as much 
as that measured under polarized OM (POM). By contrast, for spherulites with single-ring patterns 
under non-polarized OM, the inter-ring space is exactly same as that measured under POM. That is, 
a pair of alternating brighter and darker rings is actually one single crystal ring when observed 
under non-polarized OM. Ring spacing reported later in this work is based on measurement under 
non-polarized OM. 
At lower Tc’s (70~80oC) where the growth regime cannot be obtained, spherulites in POT were 
also characterized using both OM and POM, which were then compared with the POT samples 
crystallized at 85~125oC as discussed in previous figure. Above the temperature of 80oC, the 
morphology of POT displayed dual spherulites (ring-banded and ring-less) at the same 
crystallization temperature as shown in Figure 6. Interesting two types of spherulites are clearly 
seen in POT film-samples crystallized at the low temperature of 70oC, where crystallization rate 
was considerably high (in comparison to those at 110oC or higher). The brighter part of the figure is 
ringless whereas the dim portion is ringed-banded. There is a tendency that the percentage of the 
ringed spherulites becomes gradually dominated as Tc increases in the temperature range from room 
temperature to around 80oC. And there exists no double ring spherulites in this temperature range. 
In addition, these two kinds of spherulites almost melt at the same time when heated to melting 
temperature. Consequently, it does not mean that the brighter spherulites may be thicker or perfect, 
or vice versa. 
Thus, the trend of variation of POT spherulites is clear. At lower temperatures, POT exhibits 
higher crystallization rates leading to regular ringed spherulites; at higher temperatures, POT 
exhibits lower crystallization rates leading to disordered ring-banded spherulites. Both ringless and 
ring-banded spherulites can be seen in Regime-III (70~118oC), where the relative fractions of two 
types of spherulites depend on temperature. Withing the same crystal growth Regime-III, a greater 
fraction of ringless spherulites is present at the lower temperature bound (70oC), but a greater 
fraction of ring-banded spherulites at the higher temperature bound (118oC). In Regime-II (118oC 
and above), the ring-band pattern persists but is distorted to highly zig-zag irregularity.  
To examine the detail of the ring structure of spherulites, SEM photos were taken compared 
with the micrographs taken by POM and OM. As shown in Figure 7, the ring-band patterns were 
clearly seen, and the band widths of which at each crystallization temperatures were coincident with 
those measured from OM observations. Even at higher Tc (Fig. 7(A) and (B)), where it exhibits 
double ring pattern with dark extinction line separating the ring bands under POM, it shows simple 
ring bands as that under non-polarized light microscopy. In other words, a pair of double ring 
displayed one ring band under the observation of SEM. Also it can be clearly seen that the pattern in 
Fig. 7(C) is somewhat spiral from the center of the spherulite. 
It may yield useful evidence to summarize the variation trend of inter-ring spacing in POT with 
respect to crystallization temperature. Figure 8 shows the band width observed from non-polarized 
optical microscopy plotted as a function of Tc ranging from 70 to 120oC. With increasing 
temperature, the average band width first stays almost stagnant with only slight increase between 70

(Tc>46oC), dendrites with highly irregular ring-band patterns are seen, where ring-bands patterns 
superimposed on dendritic spherulites are seen only at high Tc of 52 ~ 54oC.  Dendritic 
characteristic with ring-band steadily increases with Tc within Regime-II.  For neat PCL, rough 
and barely identifiable ring bands are seen at high Tc; by contrast, when crystallized at lower Tc’s, 
the spherulites in PCL are mostly ring-less. A transition temperature is seen to locate at about 46oC 
(marking a division between Regime-II and III), where the spherulite pattern transforms from 
Maltese-cross (for Tc lower than 47oC) to dendrite (feather-like) types with irregular zig-zag rings 
(for Tc higher than 47oC).   
 
PCL/PVPh blend 
Blending of PCL with miscible amorphous polymers resulted in significant changes in the 
spherulite patterns.  PCL/PVPh blend is known to be miscible with a strong H-bonding specific 
interaction ,76 and the interaction parameter for the PCL/PVPh blend measured by the melting point 
depression method is cPCL-PVPh = -1.508.77  Spherulitic morphology and kinetic regime behavior 
for neat PCL was compared to those in the PCL/PVPh blends of a representative composition 
(w/w=90/10).  Figure 11 shows the Lauritzen-Hoffman plot covering Regime-II and –III for the 
PCL/PVPh (90/10) blend.  Inset graphs show different patterns in spherulites melt-crystallized at 
temperatures of regimes.  Striking differences in the spherulite patterns are seen between the neat 
PCL and PCL/PVPh blend.  For the PCL/PVPh (90/10) blend, spherulites are seen to become 
dendritic in crystallization from Tc=35 ~ 45oC (Regime-III); whereas for neat PCL, a very high 
Tc>55oC is needed to develop dendrites.  The strong interaction between PCL and PVPh likely 
counts for the change.  Regime kinetics transition is quite obvious as the slope change is distinct 
between two regimes, and an intersecting point is located at T=46oC, which is nearly same as that 
for neat PCL.  Slope change signals a transition in growth, as well as crystal pattern.  At Tc above 
the transition point, dendrites become more apparent and increase in the leaf size for blends 
crystallized at increasingly higher temperatures, from Tc=46 ~ 55oC (Regime-II).  Higher 
crystallization Tc greater than 55oC led to too slow growth kinetics for the blend morphology to be 
conveniently monitored.  At higher loadings of PVPh (>10 wt%) in PCL blends, dendrites become 
increasingly larger and more apparent.  For brevity, morphology for PCL/PVPh blends of higher 
PVPh loadings is not shown.  Physical changes induced by PVPh in PCL are mostly: (1) elevation 
of Tg, and (2) depression of Tm of PCL, and (3) interactions between crystallizing species and 
diluent, which all may contribute to the observed changes in the regime growth and spherulite 
patterns.  Strong H-bonding between PCL and PVPh favors slow growth of dendritic crystals and 
likely leads to cancel the formation of ring bands in PCL.  In an earlier study,78 blends of PCL with 
tannic acid (TA), a tri-phenol bio-resourceful species, also results in dendrites and similar disruption 
of ring-band patterns as that observed for the PCL/PVPh blend.   
 
PCL/PBzMA blend 
Blend of PCL/PBzMA is known to be miscible via weak-to-moderate polar-polar interactions

dendritic.  Again, ring bands in spherulites of PCL/PBzMA (70/30) blend are still apparent and 
easily recognizable when crystallized at all Tc (30~55oC).  However, the spherulites of the 
PCL/PBzMA (70/30) blend in general become smaller than those seen in the PCL/PBzMA (80/20) 
blend, and rings in this blend are less ordered too.  In general, ring patterns are the most clearly 
visible and ordered in the PCL/PBzMA blend of w/w=80/20 composition, and regularity in 
ring-bands decreases with either increase or decrease from 80/20 composition in the diluent 
contents in blends.  Inclusion of 20 wt% amorphous PBzMA in the PCL blends leads to most 
distinct or regular ring bands in spherulites; incorporation of greater fractions of amorphous 
polymer (30 wt% or higher) in the PCL blends leads to increasing disruption or eventual 
disappearance of ring bands in spherulites.   
 
PCL/PPhMA blend 
PPhMA differs from PBzMA only by a methylene in the chemical structure of repeat unit; 
however, interaction type between PCL and PPhMA is similar to that between PCL and PBzMA 
via weak C=O polarity. Three compositions of PCL/PPhMA blend (90/10, 80/20, 70/30) were 
examined and are discussed separately.  Figure 15 shows Lauritzen-Hoffman plot and spherulite 
patterns of PCL/PPhMA (90/10) blend.  Inset graphs show patterns in spherulites 
melt-crystallized at temperatures of regime-III (lower Tc =35~45oC) and Regime-II (higher 
Tc>45oC).  Ring-bands, in general, are more orderly spaced in the spherulites of the PCL/PPhMA 
blend than those found in the PCL/PBzMA blend of same compositions. By referring to the 
counterpart plots for the PCL/PBzMA (90/10) blend discussed earlier in previous figure, the 
PCL/PPhMA (90/10) blend exhibits more orderly ring bands in the spherulites at same Tc than 
does the PCL/PBzMA (90/10) blend.  For this blend, regime kinetics transition is seen with an 
intersecting point located at T = ~46oC.  Below Tc=46oC, Regime III is characterized with 
ring-band spherulites, with ring regularity decreasing with increasing Tc.  A slope change is seen 
at Tc= 46oC, where Regime-II above Tc = 46oC is featured with dendritic but ring-less spherulites.  
Figure 16 shows Lauritzen-Hoffman plot of PCL/PPhMA (80/20) blend.  Inset graphs show 
changing patterns of spherulites in the blend melt-crystallized at specific temperatures of regimes.  
Again, ring bands are seen in the spherulites of the PCL/PPhMA (80/20) blend when crystallized 
in Regime-III (lower-T regime).  For this blend composition (80/20), ring-bands are all highly 
irregular and of a zig-zag pattern, with irregularity increasing with Tc in this temperature range 
(Regime-III: 30~45oC).  Note that at Tc=45oC, the PCL/PPhMA (80/20) blend exhibits highly 
thickened and zig-zag ring bands and that the Maltese-cross pattern either disappears or is masked 
by the highly thickened/rough bands.  The plot shows that at higher temperatures, a slope change 
signals a transition to Regime-II, where spherulite growth is slow and no ring bands are present in 
the spherulites.   
Figure 17 shows Lauritzen-Hoffman plot and spherulite patterns of PCL/PPhMA (70/30) 
blend, which also displayed Regime II and III.  Inset graphs show corresponding pattern in 
spherulites melt-crystallized at temperatures of regime (30~48oC).  For this composition (70/30)

are narrower and smaller in the PCL/PPhMA blend than those in the PCL/PBzMA, which in turn 
exhibit much thinner bands and smaller inter-ring spacing than the PCL/PVPh blend.  These 
differences provided positive evidence that the patterns of ring bands are influenced by nature of the 
amorphous polymers blended in PCL. 
 
3. Analyses on Dendrite Crystals in Thin-Film Poly(ethylene oxide)/Tannin with Strong 
Interactions 
    Apart from the peculiar spherulites discussed earlier, another interesting dendritic morphology 
is obtained in PEO/TA blends. Figure 18(A) is the POM morphology of neat PEO melt-crystallized 
at 30oC, where the spherulites show normal Maltese-Cross extinction patterns.  Figure 18(B) is the 
POM morphologies of PEO/TA = 80/20 melt-crystallized at 30oC.  The spherulites become less 
compact and growth of the spherulites is no longer along the radius direction but in a curved 
direction.  Figure 18(C) is the POM morphology of PEO/TA = 70/30 melt-crystallized at 30oC.  
The crystal dendrites become feather-like and non-volume filling, which is similar to the dendrites 
found in PEO/PVPh.68 When the TA amount was up to 40%, the PEO chains in the PEO/TA blend 
became totally amorphous, and could not form any spherulite crystals in all range of temperatures.  
Figure 19 is the plot of the spherulitic radius versus time for three compositions of PEO/TA 
blend (100/0, 80/20, and 70/30).  For neat PEO and PEO/TA = 80/20, the spherulite radii versus 
time are linear relationships; however, for PEO/TA=70/30, the spherulite growth rates decrease with 
time. This behavior is similar to PEO/SHS66 and PEO/PVPh68 blends which are with strong 
intermolecular interactions. The effect of impurity segregation on the crystallization kinetics of 
polymers has been studied by Keith and Padden.79 They conclude that if the crystal growth rate is 
higher than the diffusion rate of the impurity, the impurities are trapped in interlamellar or 
interfribrillar regions. However, if the diffusion rate of the impurity is higher than crystal growth 
rate, the concentration of impurity at the growth front will increase. Thus, in the cases of PEO/TA, 
PEO/PVPh or PEO/SHS, the nonlinear growth rate is due to the slower crystal growth compared 
with the diffusion rate of the impurity caused by the strong intermolecular interaction. 
Data of growth rates of PEO and PEO/TA blends are plotted in Figure 19, where log R vs. log 
t for (A) neat PEO, and (B) PEO/TA blends, respectively.  Linear relationships obtained in both 
diagrams indicate that the growth rates are constant.  But in Figure 19(C), the relationship of log 
R vs. log t can be divided into two regions with different slopes.  In the shorter time of Figure 
19(C), the radius is directly proportional to time, ie. R a t1, but in the longer time, the relationship 
of radius and time is in R a t1/2.  Wu et al71 have reported that the change of the correlation with 
radius and time from R a t1 to R a t1/2 indicates that the growth mechanism changing to 
diffusion-limited mechanism. Thus, by same extension, the dendritic morphology in the PEO/TA 
blend may be attributed to a diffusion-limited mechanism. 
Figure 20 shows the dendritic morphology obtained for PEO/TA = 70/30 blend (A) without 
tint plate and (B) with tint plate. It can be divided into four parts corresponding to four quadrant. In 
quadrant I and III, the main trunks are of red color, while the branches are of blue color. In contrast,

diluent polymers varies.  Blending of PCL with miscible amorphous polymers changes the 
spherulite patterns significantly.  For neat PCL, in transition from regime III to regime II, the 
spherulites are patterned in ring-less to ring-banded types, respectively, in different regimes.  
Maltese-cross spherulites and dendritic spherulites (with highly irregular ring bands and no 
Maltese-cross) are featured in different growth regimes (low- and high-temperature regimes, 
respectively) in neat PCL.  Regime growth transition signals a corresponding transition in 
spherulite patterns (from Maltese-cross to dendritic).  All Maltese-cross spherulites and most 
dendrites are not ring-banded.  Only the dendrite spherulites in PCL grown at extremely high 
temperatures are ring-banded (those formed at Tc of 52 ~ 54oC or higher), in which the dendritic 
spherulites are featured with rough and irregular ring bands.  Two regimes (III and II) are 
generally observed in neat PCL or its miscible blends.  For neat PCL, the spherulites transform 
from ring-less Maltese-cross pattern (in Regime-III) to ring-banded (with rough dendrites) at higher 
temperatures of Regime-II.  Inclusion of different amorphous polymers in PCL leads to different 
extents of suppression in growth rates and induces different spherulitic patterns.  Mechanisms of 
such changes involve several factors such as nature of the polymers in blends exhibit difference in 
the interaction strength, which influence the growth kinetics, leading to difference in the spherulite 
patterns.  Transition of regimes does not necessarily signal a change from ring-less to ring band, or 
vise versa, but it does correlate with a change in the spherulite patterns.  Slope change reflects 
different growth kinetics (nucleation control or molecular diffusion control, etc), where difference 
in spherulite morphology is resulted from difference in growth kinetics.  
    The dendritic morphology obtained in PEO/TA=70/30 is attributed to the diffusion limited 
aggregation. Besides, the change of lamellar orientation from edge-on to flat-on of the branches is 
also an important factor that cause such peculiar morphology.

Paper #2:  Application of New Organophosphine as a Thermally Latent 
Accelerator to Epoxy Molding Compounds with High Silica Contents

ABSTRACT 
A new organophosphine accelerator, triphenylphosphine-1,4-benzoquinone (TPP-BQ), which 
exhibits thermal latency, was synthesized and used to catalyze the curing of biphenyl 
epoxy/phenol-aralkyl type epoxy molding compounds (EMCs).  In the study, EMCs were with a 
silica content more than 88 wt%.  The thermal behavior and molding characteristics for EMC that 
contained TPP-BQ were studied by using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), a flow tester 
and a Shore D hardness meter.  The spiral flow method and the gelation time method were also 
applied.  Analysis of thermal characteristics shows that TPP-BQ is inactive at low temperatures, 
but at high temperatures, TPP-BQ increases the curing rate of EMC in dynamic and isothermal 
curing experiments. Additionally, EMCs containing TPP-BQ exhibited excellent storage stability 
and swift hardening characteristics. Apparently, the new accelerator possessed excellent thermally 
latency in curing of biphenyl-type epoxy molding compounds with the high filler content.  Prior 
to gelation, EMC containing TPP-BQ had a lower melt viscosity than EMC containing TPP; 
therefore, the former exhibited a longer flow.  The effect of the sizes of the accelerator particles 
on the molding characteristics was also elucidated.  As EMC was accelerated by TPP-BQ, the 
gelation time, length of the spiral flow, and the reactivity of EMC all depended on the size of the 
accelerator particles. The experimental results indicated that small TPP-BQ particles increased the 
curing rate of EMC because of faster dissolution in the epoxy resin.  
Key words: accelerator, epoxy molding compound, thermal latency, biphenyl epoxy.

Abstract 
This talk attempts to address and analyze some interesting and complex lamellar patterns, such as ring bands, 
dendrites, hexagons vs. regular circular Maltese-cross spherulites, and their correlations with growth regimes 
in some representative bio-degradable polyesters, such as poly(ethylene adipate), poly(butylene adipate), and 
poly(e-caprolactone).   
 
PBA/phenoxy blend was used as the first model system for investigation in details.  Effects of various 
amorphous polymers at specific contents in blends of poly(butylene adipate) (PBA) on crystal growth and 
morphology were analyzed. Upon crystallization at Tc=33oC, unusual morphologies of hexagon crystals at 
early stages and feather-like dendritic lamellar bundles at final stage of crystallization were observed in all 
blends of PBA/amorphous polymer. Maltese-cross-patterned spherulites and dendritic spherulites (with no 
Maltese-cross) are featured in different growth regimes (low- and high-temperature regimes, respectively) of

       目的 
此會議邀請了許多國際上知名的學者，且會議分類主題中的 Blend and 
Composites與 Biopolymer and Biomaterials皆與本實驗室的研究領域相關，因此
希望藉由此參加國際會議的機會多了解國外學者的研究並與國外學者交流。 
 
             過 程 
    該會議邀請了二位 Plenary speakers，分別於會議的第二天與第三天發表
演講。其中一位為 Professor W. Henry Weinberg，其主講題目為 Nonconventional 
Catalysts for Isotactic Propylene Polymerization in Solution Developed by Using 
High-Throughput-Screening Technologies.另一位 plenary speaker 則為日本學者
Professor Sumio Iijima，其主講題目為 Science and Nanotechnology of Carbon 
Nanotubes。在這兩場演講中由於其主題都是與我的研究領域較不相同的，但在
其演講中我學習到不同領域的基礎知識以及體會到大師級教授演講時的風采。 
會議中也邀請了許多位 keynote speaker與 invited speaker。 其中在 IUPAC
擔任委員的韓國學者 Prof. Jung-II Jin 以及 X-ray 分析專家目前任職於 Toyota 
Technological Institute, Japan的 Prof. Kohji Tashiro都在受邀名單中。 除了在會議
安排的演講中聆聽了兩位教授的演講，也與 Prof. Kohji Tashiro (Editor, Polymer) 
有交談。另外會議於晚宴時也安排了 Prof. Jung-II Jin對目前 IUPAC的組織與運
作做簡單的介紹。此次會議邀請的演講中來自世界各地，除了 plenary speaker兩
位分別來自美國與日本外，keynote speaker 中也有來自日本、韓國、德國、中國
大陸、美國、加拿大、丹麥與印度等國家的學者。 
Invited speaker中則有本人 吳逸謨教授，與其它來自世界各地，如俄羅斯、
義大利、南非、中國、日本、新加坡等不同國家的學者受邀前來，其中也有泰國
的學者。此次的會議主要分成 Biopolymer and Biomaterials 、Blends and 
Composites、Polymer characterization等 14個主題。我們選擇了與我們研究領域

此次研討會雖然在亞洲國家舉辦，但是邀請的學者遍佈美洲，歐洲，甚至有非洲
國家來參加，且會議場所的安排皆很有規劃，協助的泰國學生機動性強，使得整
個會議的進行很順利，這部份也值得我們學習。 此次出國開會的經驗讓我學習
很多，許多亞洲國家，如泰國，雖其國民所得、整體經濟、工業在我國之下，然
在主辦國際會議經驗，越驅精緻。 而台灣受限於國家定位問題，主辦國際會議，
雖非不可能，但常受牽制、抵制而打折。
