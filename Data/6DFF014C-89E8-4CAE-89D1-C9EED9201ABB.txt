摘要 
本實驗以兩種導電高分子製作壓阻式壓
力感測器，該壓力感測器係用上下兩片可橈
式電極夾一孔洞性結構之可變電阻層所構成；
在未施壓時，壓力感測器中間之可變電阻層
具有較大之孔洞，如圖一，故導電高分子間
接觸面積較小，電阻較大；反之，當施加壓
力於其上時，孔洞性結構受壓縮，如圖二，
導電高分子間接觸面積下降，故電阻下降，
本實驗用此概念設計可橈式壓力感測器。 
可橈式電極係用導電高分子 PEDOT:PSS
均勻塗佈於 PET薄片上所構成，可變電阻層
則利用 UV膠均勻混合 polystyrene粉末和另
一導電高分子 PANI:HCSA所構成；壓力感測
器之大小為 2cm X 2cm，厚度約 600μm；以
PEDOT:PSS均勻塗佈於 PET薄片上之可橈式
電極，片電阻值約在 0.4(KΩ/□)；壓感測
器隨壓力由 0( kN/m2)增加到 145.2( kN/m2)，
電阻值由 115 KΩ降低至 25 KΩ。

1. 簡介 
由於電晶體密度增加，產生的熱也隨之
倍增，加上 LED體積小，造成局部溫度過高
也成為散熱不易的主要原因。為了達到非主
動式運作，必須使流體藉由毛細力來帶動系
統循環，因此設計出微型毛細泵吸環路之蒸
發區，並能克服蒸汽回衝現象的結構，以及
提高環路內真空度。另外平整度在熱接觸面
上也相對重要，本實驗研究重點著重於平整
度測量感測器之開發上。 
  其中壓力感測器廣泛的應用於各領域，
傳統上分為電容式壓力感測器、壓阻式壓力
感測器和壓電式壓力感測器三類；電容式壓
力感測器主要是利用兩平行電容板所構成，
當施加外力時兩平行電容板間距縮小，電容
因而產生變化，經由電容變化便可量測壓力
之大小；壓阻式壓力感測器，則是利用感測

ABSTRACT 
Capillary Pumped Loop (CPL) is a high efficiency two-phase heat 
transfer device. Since it does not need any other mechanical force such 
as pump, furthermore, it might be used to do the thermal management 
of high power electronic component such as spacecraft, notebook and 
computer servers. It is a cyclic circulation pumped by capillary force, 
and this force is generated from the fine porous structure in evaporator. 
This research aims to study the CPL pipe line temperature distributions. 
A steady state heat transfer method was developed to predict the 
pipeline temperature from evaporator outlet to evaporator inlet. 
Condenser inlet temperature; condenser outlet temperature; condenser 
base temperature; pressure drop along the loop could be calculated 
from the theoretical model. A good agreement between the theoretical 
results and experimental values were achieved. This theoretical
structure provides designer a new design direction and an axial heat 
transfer method that allows designer more freedom.
INTRODUCTION
Cooling equipment has been widely used in the electronic devices, 
like desktop. The personal computer generate high power load as the 
chip manufacturing technique improves. To make sure all the 
microprocessor running in a stable condition, one must keep the chip 
surface temperature under 70oC through a very efficiency cooler design. 
Capillary pumped loop plays a very significant role in the heat removal 
device. CPL is composed of five portions, evaporator, condenser, vapor 
head, vapor line, liquid head and liquid line. The schematic of the CPL 
was shown in Fig. 1. 
From the fist invented in USA [1], CPL has been studied by 
researchers over forty years. Most of the previous researchers focused 
on the evaporator, although it is the main component for CPL, but the 
method how to move the heat from the CPL stills an important issue. A 
coefficient of performance for the plate-fin heat sink in forced 
convection was analyzed by Madhusudan and Avram [2]. The study 
identifies the optimization methodology for force convection design in 
plate-fin heat sink. Pouzet et al. [3] presented a dynamic response 
model of CPL. At the condenser section, one-dimension hypothesis 
was used, the two-phase zone length is finite, the vapor void fraction is 
constant over time and the heat flux density exchanged between the 
fluid and the condenser wall is uniform. Via the momentum balance, 
mass balance and energy balance, the mass flow rate in condenser 
could be calculated. An analytical approach for heat exchanger 
performance under various operating condition was presented by 
Khandai et al. [4]. Two-dimension heat transfer model was developed. 
Each fin had different temperature, and when a non linear condenser 
temperature drop was considered, the predict values of heat exchanger 
thermal resistance was more agree with real case. Analyzing and 
modeling heat pipe performance was very popular for many 
researchers. Legierski [5] presented the 3-D thermal simulation model 
about cooling fins equipped with heat pipe. The results showed that the 
power could be increased by 15-16% for heat sink with heat pipe. Z. 
Jon Zuo [6] presented a simplified hydrodynamic model to predict the 
thermal performance of the pulsating heat pipe. The best fluid fill ratio 
was 70% for experiment and 75% for model prediction and the 
maximum heat performance rate could reach to 220W/cm2. Haider [7] 
presented a thermosyphon model based on mass, momentum, and 
energy balances in his loop. In his model, there were some assumptions, 
it clouds equal liquid and vapor phase velocities, ideal gas, pressure 
drops were neglected in the evaporator and condenser section, and heat 
losses from the liquid line and vapor line were neglected also. Liu [8] 
designed a flat-type CPL with same volume in evaporator section and 
condenser section, as same as previous authors, the model was based 
on thermodynamic and hydrodynamic theory. 
The purpose of this study is set up a new method to predict the 
CPL condenser outlet temperature, the experiments data also verifies 
the prediction data with sufficient accuracy and could be used in 
estimating the CPL performance.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The evaporator consists of porous wick structure, metal fins and 
vapor grooves inside it. The overall loop was made of aluminum and 
the porous wick was made of high-density polyethylene. The outside 
shape of evaporator was a 60X60X16.5mm3 cubic; the detail structure 
was described in [9]. Seven grooves on the surface of the evaporator, 
each groove served as the function of the channel of vapor. The channel 
was semi-circle shape with radius of 1.5mm. To let the working fluid 
could flow into the center of the wick without any resistance and finally 
be absorbed by wick very quickly. A liquid channel was designed in the 
medium of porous material with depth length 2.5cm from the porous 
surface. For the condenser section, a round tube with 4 mm of inner 
diameter and 6 mm of outer diameter was serviced as a vapor line, 
condenser section and liquid line. The condenser is defined as a section 
of the channel between vapor line and liquid line. The size of thin fin 
was 40x20x0.15mm3 and the planer copper cubic was 40x60x5mm3.
A smooth wall round tube was adapted as the vapor line, 
condenser and liquid line; its inner diameter is 4 mm. The condenser is 
defined as a section of the channel between vapor line and liquid line 
and it was covered with heat sink. An air duct was used on the 
condenser to increase the efficiency of the heat dissipation. Two case 
fans 4028 were used to blow the thin fin. For two identical 4028 fans 
were thus obtained 1 m3/minute of volumetric flow rate.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Condenser base temperature Tc,n with respect to fin number at 
variable thermal loadings and different inventories WO/R-65%, 
WO/R-75%, W/R-75% and W/R-85% were simulated and the Figure 3 
showed the Condenser base temperature with respect to fin number at 
variable thermal loadings for W/R-75%. Obviously, condenser 
temperature was decreased with increasing the fin number. From these 
figures, one might easy to find how many fin need in a typical thermal 
loading.

Fin removal heat ability about differential experimental samples 
was shown from Fig.4. Heat sink could be divided into two parts 
according to the location. The anterior half of the fin could remove 
much more heat than posterior’s. Fin removal heat ability from the first 
fin to the latest one was not same although each one had same material 
and specifications. This was because each fin suffered different power.

Fig.4 W/R-75% fin heat removal ability
The fin heat removal ability was function of thermal load. 
Comparing the situations at the 70 fins and QCPU was 70W, fin removal 
ability was 0.4W at WO/R-65%; 0.45W at WO/R-75% and 0.34W at 
W/R-85%. Hence, the thermal properties indeed affected the CPL 
performance although CPL geometric parameters were the same.
The residual power at each fin at variable thermal loadings were 
shown from Fig.5 for experimental sample W/R-75%. Heat was 
removed from the 1st fin to the last fin in sequence when the hot fluid 
was flowing through the heat sink. For this reason, the next fin received 
amount of residual power was lower than the former one. Therefore, 
the curve slop was negative, and the residual power was gradually 
reduced to zero with increasing of fin number.

Fig.5 The residual power at each fin at variable thermal loadings for 
W/R-75% 
The working fluid mass flow rate at each fin for four experimental 
samples at variable thermal loadings was shown from Fig.6. Mass flow 
rate was decreased with increasing of fin number. Heat was removed 
via the fin and condenser base, working fluid changed its phase form 
vapor to liquid by released latent heat, if more sensible heat was 
released from the liquid, the fluid was eventually turn to be subcooled 
liquid. As expected, residual power was closely related to mass flow 
rate. The residual power curve slop tendency was same as the mass 
flow rate curve. Nevertheless, the mass flow rate at the latest fin was 
not zero; hence, the loop still could circulate smoothly.
