Abstract
ZnO:Al thin films were deposited by the RF magnetron sputtering method. The Al2O3-doped
zinc oxide target was sputtered by pure argon gas. The effect of working pressure on the
structural, electrical, and optical properties of the thin films were studied. The microstructure of
ZnO:Al films is found to be affected obviously by changing the working pressure. With
increasing working pressure, the deposition rate decreased, and the film microstructure changed
from crystalline phase with a hexagonal wurtzite structure to amorphous one. The electrical
resistivity increases with an increase of working pressure. Additionally, The results of optical
transmittance measurement of ZnO:Al thin films reveal a high transmittance ( >80% ) in visible
region and exhibit a sharp absorption edge at wavelength about 350 nm. The energy bandgap in
crystalline films is approximately 3.54 eV, whereas optical bandgap in poor crystallized structure
films is larger than this value.

二、前言
The inexpensive and nontoxic zinc oxide (ZnO) based materials have attracted a lot of
attentions as the transparent conductive material in recent years due to the extreme commercial
interest in progressing flat panel display, solar cell, and other different optoelectronic devices
[1-5]. The ZnO-based materials are also promising for application as an ultraviolet and blue light
emitter because of sufficiently large excitation binding energy of 60 meV, which is stable even at
room temperature. There were many techniques employed to grow ZnO-based thin films,
including magnetron sputtering [6,7], pulsed laser deposition [8], reactive electron-beam
evaporation [9,10], metalorganic chemical vapor deposition [11], metallic zinc oxidation [12],
spray pyrolysis [13-15], and molecular beam epitaxy [16]. For all of these deposition techniques,
homoepitaxy is now possible, most of the growth up to now has been heteroepitaxy, usually on
glass, silicon, or sapphire (Al2O3). In comparison with GaN/Al2O3, ZnO/Al2O3 has roughly
equivalent X-ray linewidths and photoluminescence linewidths, and much lower dislocation
densities. Moreover, ZnO has been grown on many other substrates, such as CaF2, GaAs,
MgAl2O4, and ScAlMgO4, as well as on GaN. The latter system, n-ZnO/p-GaN, has produced
blue light emitting diodes. In addition, pure transparent zinc oxide films are usually highly
resistive. However, non-stoichiometric and doped zinc oxide films have high conductivities, but
non-stoichiometric films are not very stable at high temperatures. Therefore, the doped ZnO films
are more suitable for practical application.
五、研究方法
The transparent conductive Al2O3-doped ZnO films were grown on 1737F Corning glass
substrate by RF magnetron sputtering (figure 2) operating at room temperature with a power of
50W for 2h. A three-inches circular shape target of ZnO mixed with 2 wt.% Al2O3 was employed.
The sputtering chamber was evacuated to 8×10-6 Torr. Then, the high purity Ar gas with pressure
ranges varied from 2.5 to 40.0 mTorr was used to evaluate the influence of the working pressure
on structural, electrical, and optical characteristics of the ZnO:Al thin films.
The surface morphology and microstructure of the ZnO:Al films were studied using the
FE-SEM. The crystalline structure and orientation of the ZnO:Al thin films were analyzed by
X-ray diffraction (XRD). The film thickness was determined from SEM images of the fracture
cross-section area of the ZnO:Al films. The electrical resistivities were determined by the van der
Pauw method. The optical transmission spectra through the ZnO:Al thin films were recorded
using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200~800 nm.
六、結果與討論
Figs. 3 (a) and (b) show the SEM micrographs of ZnO:Al thin films prepared at working
pressure of 2.5 and 20.0 mTorr. It can be seen that the grain size of the films deposited at various
working pressures is quite different. The grain size is decreased with an increase of working
pressure. The working pressure demonstrates a noticeable effect on the microstructure of ZnO:Al
thin films. The sputtered materials possess a mean free path that is comparable to the distance in
which from target to substrate at lower pressure. These arriving materials, at lower pressure, have
much higher energy that results in higher surface mobility and thus a much larger possibility to
form ZnO:Al thin films.
Fig. 4 demonstrates the growth rate of ZnO:Al films prepared with different working
pressures. The average growth rate was calculated based on the mean value of thickness from the
thin films lower. Moreover, it has been shown earlier that the growth rate is decreased with
increasing of working pressure. The average grain size of the ZnO:Al films is smaller at a higher
working pressure, which increases the grain-boundary scattering and thus decreases the mobility.
Therefore, it can be summarized that the increase of electrical resistivity of ZnO:Al thin films
with increasing working pressure is due to the decrease in the carrier concentration and mobility.
Fig. 7 demonstrates the optical transmission spectra of ZnO:Al films as a function of
wavelength prepared at various working pressures. The average optical transmittance in the
visible region is above 80% for all of the films and decreases with an increase in working
pressure. According to the cross-section images of the ZnO:Al thin films, the thickness of the
films decreases as the working pressure is increased. The thickness of the ZnO:Al thin films with
working pressure of 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mTorr is 164, 125, 95, 73, and 52 nm, respectively. At
higher working pressures, the composition of the ZnO:Al becomes much nonstoichiometric and
their grain sizes decrease. It results in the light scattering loss and the destruction of coherence
between incident light and reflected light and therefore leads to the disappearance of interference
fringes as well as the decrease in transmittance.
