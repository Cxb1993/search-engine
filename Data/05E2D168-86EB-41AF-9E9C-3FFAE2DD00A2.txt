3   Results and Discussions 
This work compares our approach with ConSurf [1] in identifying hot spots of the 
GrpE protein of Escherichia coli, for which we have a complex structure in PDB 
database presenting its interaction with the DnaK protein. Both approaches use the 
same 100 homologous proteins of the target protein. The resulted conservation plot 
generated by MAGIIC is as shown in Fig. 1. When compared with results of Consurf 
as shown in Fig. 2, MAGIIC in particular discovered residues Arg74 and Lys82 with 
fewer false alarms involved, where residues Arg74 and Lys82 have been reported as 
important residues in interaction with DnaK protein both by Ref. [2] and Ref. [3]. 
Besides, our approach takes only 6 seconds, while ConSurf takes 590 seconds.

The second scenario borrows the idea of BAG [4] in detecting multi-domain proteins. 
Scenario 2. Protein A is considered as a problem protein if it is an articulated protein in a graph. 
Fig. 1 (b) and (c) shows the examples of these two scenarios. After the list of suspicious proteins is 
constructed, we delete all the E-value scores of each doubtful protein except the strongest one, 
resulting in a reduced graph with fewer edges but same number of portions. 
 
3 Results and discussions.  
 
This study employs two data sets, named Human and SP-41, which were previously created by [1]. 
The number of proteins in each data set is shown in Table 1. The derived reduced graphs are then 
adopted by single-linkage algorithm to construct protein hierarchies. Table 2 shows the averaged 
matching rates [1] of InterPro families for each hierarchy. It can be seen that the performance of 
single-linkage algorithm can be improved by removing noisy edges from the graph, but the 
improvement is not as much as the average-linkage algorithm or HomoClust [2] that is designed to 
avoid chaining effect. Next, we use scenario 3 to find out the proteins that might cause problems. 
Scenario 3. Protein A is considered as a suspicious protein if it connects to two homogeneous 
clusters derived by HomoClust, but these two clusters do not a common ancestor in the hierarchy. 
From Table 2, the list generated by Scenario 3 indeed help to remove noisy relationships as 
expected. However, after examining the members of different in the list, we observed that the 
problem proteins are not correlated with the multi-domain proteins annotated by CATH database.

When only exact elements are considered in mining pro-
cess, the derived patterns are usually very sparse, in which
the pattern elements are interleaved with a large amount of
gaps. Patterns of this type are hard to detect but are greatly
appreciated because they concisely highlight the important
residues associated with protein functional sites. In proteins,
the conserved residues usually appear as clusters (it is called
a block in this paper), and multiple clusters together consti-
tute an important substructure. The conserved regions that
strongly correlate with each other and conserved simultan-
eously are usually interleaved with large irregular gaps
(16,17). In other words, the residues associated with a func-
tional motif are not necessarily found in one region of the
sequence (2,16–20). This complicates the mining process
and often confuses the approaches based on multiple
sequence alignment.
Regular expression is considered as a deterministic model
contrary to the probabilistic models such as profiles and
HMMs (11). A deterministic pattern can be matched or not
matched by a sequence. In the mining process, a pattern
will be reported as long as it matches more than a user-
specified percentage of the input sequence set. This is the
so-called minimum support constraint (21). A pattern is
said to be diagnostic for a family if it matches all the
known sequences in the family, and no other known sequence
(10). However, a diagnostic pattern does not always corres-
pond to a functional signature. By setting the minimum sup-
port constraint as a lower value, MAGIIC-PRO can discover
patterns that really present as functional signatures but are
only conserved in a subset of input sequences. Such patterns
are more informative and useful in predicting ligand binding
or protein interaction.
Discovering sparse and flexible patterns which are con-
served in only a subset of input sequences is a time-
consuming task due to the large search space of solutions.
So many related studies employ other constraints in addition
to the minimum support constraint to expedite the mining
process. Mining algorithms that consider only short con-
served words (5,6,18,19) or rigid gaps (7–9,13), such as
web service Teiresias (13), are efficient and effective in iden-
tifying short motifs. On the other hand, the Pratt (22) algo-
rithm introduced the concept of gap flexibility to enlarge
the search space. However, allowing large flexible gaps
might derive patterns with the conserved residues scattered.
Furthermore, it has been shown by experiments in our recent
work that considering large flexibilities causes the failure of
Pratt to deliver satisfied results within an acceptable time
(17). Different from the previous works, our approach con-
siders two types of gaps to improve the mining efficiency,
where the gaps within a conserved region are called an intra-
block gap and the gaps in between two adjacent conserved
regions are called inter-block gaps (17). Using two types of
gap constraints for different purposes improves the efficiency
of mining process while keeping high accuracy of mining res-
ults. The server MAGIIC-PRO further employs rigid intra-
block gaps instead of the flexible ones proposed in Ref.
(17) since it has been observed in protein sequences that
insertions and deletions are seldom present in highly con-
served regions (2,13). Our experimental results also reveal
that considering only rigid gaps within a block is useful in
eliminating noisy patterns.
MAGIIC-PRO provides many useful tools for examining
and visualizing the derived patterns, which will be described
in detail later. After that, we will show by experiments that
MAGIIC-PRO is efficient and effective in identifying func-
tional sites and predicting hot regions in protein–protein
interactions.
METHOD
The web service MAGIIC-PRO is in particular designed for
mining protein sequences, where the kernel algorithm execut-
ing sequential pattern mining is based on our previously
developed algorithm MAGIIC (17) incorporated with several
state of the art data mining techniques. MAGIIC-PRO first
quickly identifies rigid gapped blocks by bounded-prefix
growth technique of MAGIIC. After that, the candidate
blocks are concatenated into patterns with large irregular
gaps by exploiting the antimonotone characteristic of this
problem (20,21). Finally, a newly proposed bounded-gap
closure checking scheme developed based on Ref. (23) is
executed to eliminate patterns that can be covered by other
super patterns with the same occurrences.
After the mining process terminates, MAGIIC-PRO gener-
ates a pattern snapshot that shows all the derived patterns in
alignment with the query protein. The residues present in dif-
ferent patterns are combined together to create a conservation
plot, where the conservation level of each residue is determ-
ined by the percentage of total number of supporting proteins
merged from different patterns. The conservation plot pro-
vides a whole picture about the conserved residues of a
query protein.
Input
We assume that every user of MAGIIC-PRO has a protein
sequence of interest at hand. MAGIIC-PRO takes a protein
sequence as input, and helps the users to prepare the training
data for pattern mining. The task of collecting relative
sequences of the query protein can be achieved by using
Swiss-Prot annotations or executing the PSI-BLAST pro-
gram. Once the query protein and the training data have
been determined, the mining process is executed using the
parameters described in the following subsection.
Parameters
The most important parameter of MAGIIC-PRO is the min-
imum support constraint. A pattern will be reported as long
as it matches at least a certain number of sequences. The sup-
port constraint is critical to the mining results, but it might
not be possible to know in advance by what percentage
level a satisfied pattern can be discovered. Since lower values
bring more patterns, the users are suggested to start with
a large support constraint, e.g. 90%, and MAGIIC-PRO will
decrease it gradually until a desired number of patterns have
been found.
In addition to the minimum support constraint, MAGIIC-
PRO has some other parameters for advanced users. Before
going into the details, we first give a formal definition of a pat-
tern block. Assume that a pattern is consisted of pattern ele-
ments as a sequence, and each successive pair of elements is
either interleaved with a gap or not. In this work, small and
Nucleic Acids Research, 2006, Vol. 34, Web Server issue W357
Different from the conservation plot, a pattern snapshot in
addition tells which pattern blocks are simultaneously con-
served during evolution. The users are suggested to browse
the lists of the top 10 high-support and top 10 large-size pat-
terns. The size of a pattern is defined as the number of exact
components it contains. A pattern with a high support usually
highlights the most highly conserved residues that are related
to a functional region, while a longer pattern with a lower
support in general provides a complete signature with respect
to a functional site.
Here we use the same example from Figure 1a to explain
how the interactive snapshot can facilitate examining the
mining results. In Figure 1b, we first examine the top 10 high-
support patterns with 3 or more blocks. Similar patterns can
be considered as being associated with the same functional
site, but each of them is distinct from the others because
the sets of supporting sequences are different. The top one
pattern in Figure 1b identifies the most three important
regions of this query protein, which are related to the binding
sites of the ligands FAD and NAP, denoted as the blocks 1, 2
and 3 in both Figures 1a and 2. Next, we can request the top
ten large-size patterns with three or more blocks. It is
observed in Figure 1c that blocks 4 and 5 are the next most
conserved blocks that are simultaneously conserved with
blocks 1, 2 and 3, and the further next is the block 6. The
top one large-size pattern in Figure 1c is plotted with an
available PDB structure in Figure 2, showing that these six
blocks together constitute a complete signature regarding
the binding sites of ligands FAD and NAP.
To facilitate studying the patterns of interest, we provide
five useful links for each pattern. First, the web page high-
lights the locations of the pattern in its supporting sequences.
Second, the derived pattern can be plotted with a protein
structure if there are PDB entries available for any of the sup-
porting sequences. Third, the derived pattern can be fed to the
ScanProsite web service to check its selectivity, the ability to
reject false positive matches. Fourth, the users can perform
a multiple sequence alignment on the segments of supporting
sequences that are associated with the selected pattern. This
helps the user to construct a more generalized pattern with
amino acid substitutions considered. Fifth, MAGIIC-PRO
aligns each excluded sequence with the segment of the
query protein. This helps to tell why a particular sequence
does not match the pattern.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this section, we first demonstrate the efficiency of
MAGIIC-PRO in identifying long patterns based on the 13
datasets with different levels of similarities listed in Table 1.
With the default settings of the advanced parameters,
MAGIIC-PRO starts the search by setting the minimum sup-
port constraint as 90%, and decreases this constraint step by
step until at least one pattern have been found. At this stage,
we observed that most of the patterns with the maximum sup-
port are related to a functional site of the query protein but do
not serve as a complete signature of a functional site. In order
to find patterns with more conserved blocks involved, we
continued decreasing the minimum support constraint and
stopped the process when the calculation time of a single
mining task is longer than 60 s. Table 1 reports the minimum
support where we stopped for each dataset, as well as the
searching time used in the latest search. Table 1 also shows
the number of blocks generated in the first stage of the mining
process and the number of derived patterns with at least two
blocks. It is observed in Table 1 that a large amount of single
blocks do not collaborate with other blocks to form a longer
pattern. The number of patterns converges rapidly when the
number of blocks in a pattern increases. The patterns found
in the top 10 high-support and the top 10 large-size lists of
each dataset demonstrate the potential of MAGIIC-PRO in
identifying functional sites and hot regions in protein–protein
interactions. Owing to the limited space, we only show one
experimental result in the following paragraph, while the
others are provided on the web page of MAGIIC-PRO.
Here we use the case of query protein P00730 to illustrate
that the long patterns found by MAGIIC-PRO are biologic-
ally meaningful. The pattern in Figure 3a constitutes the
pocket for INF (N-(Hydroxyaminocarbonyl) Phenylalanine)
and the zinc ions. This pattern matches 42 sequences in the
training data. A longer pattern with a lower support
