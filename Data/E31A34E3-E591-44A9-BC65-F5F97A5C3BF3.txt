英文摘要 
 
Phase change materials were employed in industrial applications very often. The 
solidification of a binary solution is one of them (for example, energy-stored materials). The 
objective of this project was to investigate the existence of porous media on the temperature-rise 
phenomena due to nucleation during the solidification process of a binary solution by means of 
experimental method. The mixture of a hypoeutectic aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl-H2O) 
solution and transparent glass beads were adopted as the test sample in this project and they were 
put into an adiabatic enclosure cooled from the side chiller. Both temperature distribution and the 
movement of solid-liquid interface were measured in experiments. In the experimental 
measurement, the impact of the initial concentration of NH4Cl-water solution on the feature of 
heat transport was investigated.

一、前言： 
 
研究計畫之背景及重要性： 
圖 1.1 所示為二元溶液(solution of a binary mixture)充斥於多孔介質(porous medium)的
示意圖，它的凝固(solidification)過程之應用範圍很廣，包括土壤及岩石的凝固、食物處理
過程的固化現象、合成金屬材料的鑄造、儲能系統的儲冰過程以及低溫生物科技的應用等
等[1-5]。相對於液態純物質(pure substance)的凝固過程，二元溶液的凝固過程較其複雜許
多，如圖 1.2 所示，一般液態純物質的凝固點為固定，亦即相變化發生於固定溫度，而且通
常只有熱傳現象產生，而二元溶液的凝固過程通常發生於某一溫度範圍內而非固定溫度(如
圖 1.3 所示)，除了相變化的產生外，還包含了複雜的熱傳、質傳以及因熱質傳所引起的自
然對流。在冷凍空調的領域，常見的食品冷凍以及儲冰水式空調系統，經常有多孔介質充
滿二元溶液的凝固現象存在，例如：食品冷凍經常以鹽水來保持食物的新鮮[3,6]，而儲冰水
式空調系統(chilled water storage system)則經常利用不同的添加物來改變儲冰槽內流體的凝
固點[4,7]，如優態鹽混合物(eutectic salt mixtures)；而這些都與其凝固過程的熱質傳相關，
因此如果能瞭解這些混合物的凝固過程之熱質傳現象，將有助於改善食物的保鮮效果與估
算保存食物所需的冷凍冷藏能力，進而設計適當的冷藏庫，節省不必要浪費的能源，而對
於儲冰水式空調系統也可更加瞭解各種添加物的熱質傳特性，以改善儲冰槽內流體的凝固
點，並達到改善系統的性能以及省能的目的，尤其在講究節約能源的今天，更突顯其重要
問題而忽略自然對流效應，只考慮熱擴散(thermal diffusion)現象，因此這一類問題的統禦方
程式(governing equation)是以擴散項(diffusion term)為主導的熱方程式(heat equation)，所研
究的重點主要包括溫度在二元溶液凝固過程的分佈與其擴散速率，以及固態區與混合區的
成長速率等等。例如：Fang 與 Cheung[8]等人曾對低優態濃度二元溶液其凝固過程之熱傳
現象進行較深入的研究，他們的研究目的是想瞭解核子反應爐內熔解的 MgO-UO2 之凝固現
象，與前述的合金溶液相同，MgO-UO2 不易觀察其凝固過程，所以為實驗觀察方便，他們
選擇含鹽成份較低的稀釋鹽水溶液(dilute salt solution)為替代品以觀察其固液介面移動的情
形，同時他們也發展了一套以忽略質傳效應與假設固液二相為局部熱平衡的熱傳導理論模
式來預測低優態濃鹽水溶液的冷卻速率(freezing rate)。又如低優態濃度二元溶液常被用作
儲能材料，主要是因為其具有高潛熱值特性外，並且其凝固點的溫度範圍廣大，可用於各
種不同的儲能系統，最近賴元生等人[9]利用其共晶蓄冷的特性，將其應用於低溫物流系統
之研究，希望找出較佳的儲能材料以達到節能的目的，研究的蓄冷材料包括 NH4Cl（aq）、
Mg(NO3)2（aq）、SrCl2（aq）、KCl（aq）與 MgCl2（aq）。

    二元溶液與多孔介質混合物的凝固現象之研究大多局限於低優態濃度二元溶液，包括
低溫生物科技、食品冷凍處理過程及儲能系統的儲冰過程等等，如前面所提，它不像純物

液介面移動(propagation)的問題，但他們的數學模式僅限於理論的推導，尚未能應用至實際
的數值模擬。而 Cao, Yang, Rastogi 和 Poulikakos 等人[11,12]曾做過一連串相關實驗；Cao
和 Poulikakos[11]則針對 NH4Cl-H2O 溶液與球狀多孔介質混合物的凝固過程進行實驗研

二、實驗方法及步驟 
 
 實驗部份主要針對底部冷卻的邊界條件進行多孔介質與低優態濃度二元溶液的凝固過
程之熱傳特性研究，實驗項目包括(1)以溫度熱電偶量測溫度分佈以及(2)觀察相變過程固液
介面的移動。量測溫度分佈主要想瞭解成核現象所產生的溫升效應對凝固過程的熱傳影
響，而量測固液介面的移動則可瞭解溫升效應對對凝固速率的影響。 
 
(1) 實驗設備之建立： 
實驗進行的方式是將透明玻璃球的多孔介質與低優態濃度氯化氨-水溶液(NH4Cl-H2O)
混合物放入設計的密閉容器內，本實驗將施以側面冷卻以觀察其凝固過程的熱傳現象。本
計劃採用氯化氨-水溶液的原因是此種二元物質融解或凝固溫度較高，因此實驗容易控制，
另外它在兩相混合區會產生樹枝狀結構(dendrites)，與合金類似並且透明容易觀察，它已被
許多學者採用以研究液態合金的凝固過程。如圖 2.1 所示，它的優態點(eutectic point)溫度
為-15.4 0C, 優態點成份濃度為 19.7wt% NH4Cl，當氯化氨濃度低於優態點成份濃度時稱之
為低優態濃度溶液(hypoeutectic solution)，其混合區的溫度介於 -15.4 0C 與 0 0C 之間。本計
劃預定的實驗架構如圖 2.2 所示，實驗主要分為三大部份：架設實驗容器、溫度量測與固
液界面位置量測，各部份分別敘述如下： 
 
架設實驗容器： 
本計劃將製作如圖 2.2 所示的 10cm x 10cm 而內部厚度為 3cm 的透明容器，容器內將
裝滿透明玻璃球與低優態濃度氯化氨-水溶液(NH4Cl-H2O)混合物，為了避免凝固時因低溫
產生結露現象，容器將由厚 5cm 的壓克力製成，而為了達到凝固的效果，將製造銅塊熱交
換器並利用恒溫水槽(Thermo Neslab RTE-740 低溫恆溫水槽)循環地將適當比例的乙二醇
水溶液通入容器底部的銅塊熱交換器之中使其保持定溫，而除了上方與底部外，其餘各面
利用隔熱材料(例如：保溫棉)加以包覆以達到絕熱狀態，凝固實驗進行過程，將在容器上

三、結果與討論 
 
 為研究多孔介質對氯化氨-水溶液凝固過程的溫升現象，本計畫以直徑 5mm 的玻璃球為
多孔介質樣品，並且研究以 5%, 10%, 15%的氯化氨-水溶液對凝固過程的溫升現象之影響。
為觀察氯化氨-水溶液凝固過程的現象，銅塊熱交換器控制在-30± 0.1℃，圖 3.1 為 15%氯化
氨-水溶液凝固過程的結冰情形，由圖中白色部份得知冰層最厚的部份發生在中間偏下方，
主要原因是低優態濃度二元溶液的濃度梯度與溫度梯度對密度的變化為同一方向，因此當
銅熱交換器開始降溫時，靠近它的溶液之密度較遠離它的溶液之密度高因而導致流體向下
流動，而流動過程中由於部份流體穿越具多孔結構的混合區(mushy zone)導致較下方的晶
體成長較慢，所以形成中間區域較厚實的結構。對於 5%與 10%氯化氨-水溶液的凝固過程亦
有相似的結冰結構。 
 
 
圖 3.1 15% NH4Cl-H2O 凝固過程結冰影像 
 
圖 3.1(a)、(b)所示為圖 2.2 各量測點的溫度隨時間變化圖(每 0.5 秒紀錄一次)，並
分別比較有無加入玻璃球的差異，圖中顯示越接近銅塊溫度下降得越快。圖(a)中顯示未加
入玻璃球時，量測點愈下面及愈遠離銅塊，則溫升效應愈明顯，主要原因除了成核結晶影
響外，靠近銅塊附近向下流動的流體會在容器內形成渦流，因此將遠離銅塊的較高溫流體
與低溫流體混合並造成上述溫升現象。圖(b)為加入玻璃球後各點的溫度變化，結果顯示溫
升效應較未加入玻璃球的情況不明顯，主要原因為加入玻璃球後阻礙流體流動，因此部份
溫升現象主要來自於成核結晶影響，並非來自流體的混合所產生。至於 5%及 15%氯化氨-水
溶液凝固過程的溫升現象與 10%相似。 
 
在凝固厚度量測方面，圖 3.2 為 10%氯化氨-水溶液凝固過程各時間點混合區及固態區
的成長厚度變化，由圖(a)中可發現無論是否加入多孔介質，固態區的成長厚度幾乎無差
異。然而圖(b)顯示加入玻璃球使得混合區成長厚度較無加入玻璃球的成長厚度大，主要是
因為無玻璃球時，流體穿越混合區使的結構變鬆散，因而成長厚度的速率趨於較緩慢。至
於 5%及 15%氯化氨-水溶液凝固過程混合區及固態區的成長厚度與 10%相似。

Abstract 
 
Computational analysis of transient phenomenon followed by the periodic state of laminar flow and 
heat transfer due to an insulated rotating object in a square cavity is investigated.  A finite-volume-
based computational methodology utilizing primitive variables is used.  Various rotating objects 
(circle, square and equilateral triangle) with different sizes are placed in the middle of the cavity.  A 
combination of a fixed computational grid with a sliding mesh was utilized for the square and 
triangle shapes.  The cavity is maintained as a differentially-heated enclosure and the motionless 
insulated object is set in rotation at time t = 0.  Natural convection heat transfer is neglected.  For a 
given shape of the object and a constant angular velocity, a range of rotating Reynolds numbers are 
covered for a Pr = 5 fluid.  The Reynolds numbers were selected so that the flow fields are not 
generally affected by the Taylor instabilities (Ta < 1750).  The evolving flow field and the 
interaction of the rotating objects with the recirculating vortices at the four corners are elucidated.  
The corresponding thermal fields in relation to the evolving flow patterns and the skewness of the 
temperature contours in comparison to conduction-only case were discussed.  The skewness is 
observed to become more marked as the Reynolds number is lowered.  At the same time, similarity 
of the thermal fields for various shapes for the same Reynolds number verifies the appropriate 
selection of the hydraulic diameter.  Transient variations of the average Nusselt numbers on the two 
walls show that for high Re numbers, a quasi-periodic behavior due to the onset of the Taylor 
instabilities is dominant, whereas for low Re numbers, periodicity of the system is clearly observed.  
Time-integrated average Nusselt number of the cavity is correlated to the rotational Reynolds 
number and shape of the object.  The triangle object clearly gives rise to high heat transfer followed 
by the square and circle objects. 
1.  Introduction 
Control and regulation of convective flows through active and passive means is extremely 
important to design of heat exchange systems.  To this end, variations of these techniques in a 
simple square cavity addressing lid-driven flow (Shi and Khodadadi, 2002), buoyancy-driven 
convection within differentially heated cavity (Shi and Khodadadi, 2003) and forced convection 
within a cavity with inlet and outlet ports (Saeidi and Khodadadi, 2006) have been studied.  In 
addition to the simplicity of the square cavity geometry, these flows exhibit simultaneous existence 
of diverse flow regimes involving boundary layers and multiple separated regions.  Many practical 
problems can be simplified as a cavity model.  These include design of mixing chambers, cooling of 
electronic components, ventilation of buildings, design of solar collectors, thermal storage, etc. 
2.1 Geometric and Dynamic Scaling of the Problem 
 
The side of the cavity is a natural length scale for the geometric scaling of the problem.  However, 
the dynamics of the flow field needs to be scaled with a meaningful length scale associated with the 
passageway available to the fluid.  Such a hydraulic diameter is defined in studies of porous media 
and is expressed as (Middleman 1997): 
 
.
area wetted
 volumefluid2=hD             (2) 
 
For a rotating cylinder with a circular cross-section (diameter D), the hydraulic diameter is: 
 
.

4πDH2
22
, +
−=chD             (3) 
 
Hydraulic diameter for a square (side L) in the cavity is given by: 
 
,
4L4H

whereas for an equilateral triangle (side S) in the cavity, it is: 
 
.
3S4H
S43H2
22
, +
−=thD            (5) 
 
Using these relations, one will be able to directly compare the benefits and drawbacks of various 
shapes if they possess the same hydraulic diameter.  Note that for very small objects, the hydraulic 
diameter tends to H/2. 
 
2.2 Dimensionless Form of the Governing Equations 
 
The dimensionless form of the governing equations can be obtained via introducing the following 
dimensionless variables: 
 
   
H
xX =

yY =  ωhD
uU =  ω

ω=      (6) 
 
The governing equations of continuity, momentum, and thermal energy are then written in 
dimensionless form:

employed.  In utilizing a sliding mesh, one does not need to re-grid at each time step, so that the 
grid number is always the same.  The computational domain is divided into two parts: one is the 
rotating zone and the other is the stationary region.  The rotating zone is defined as a circle region 
encompassing the square or equilateral triangle object.  A grid interface to connect both regions 
needs to be defined.  Once the simulation starts, the rotating zone moves along the grid interface 
and rotates the square or triangle object, while the grids in the stationary region are kept motionless. 
 
It takes the time period ω
πτ 2=  for an object to rotate one revolution. After conducting a time-step 
independence test, the time-step for numerical simulation was chosen as 240/τ .  Grid-
independence test for a rotating circle at Re = 111 was performed for six grid densities (1200, 2352, 
4800, 9480, 19200, and 37632 cells) by Shih et al. (2007) for an isothermal rotating object inside a 
constant temperature cavity.  The numerical results revealed that the relative errors for both average 
skin friction coefficients and average Nusselt numbers on the surface of the rotating circle and 
cavity walls decrease with the increase of grid density.  The difference between the numerical 
results based on the 19200 and 37632 cells was insignificant.  The grid-independence test proved 
the numerical robustness of FLUENT in solving this problem and a grid density with 19200 cells 
was employed for the production runs.  The convergence criteria of each time step for the energy 
equation and other equations required that the normalized residuals become smaller than 10-6 and 
10-3, respectively.  The numerical simulation of each case was stopped when the difference of the 
average Nusselt numbers on the left and right walls is less than 0.5%.  Given this criterion, the 
number of cycles for various rotating objects to reach periodic or quasi-periodic states are 
summarized in Table 1. 
 
3.  Results and Discussion 
 
The transient leading to periodic flow and thermal fields for the posed problem are discussed now.  
Starting with an initial field discussed above, the object started to rotate at t = 0.  The simulations 
were progressed with a time increment equal to 240/τ  and the relevant convergence criterion were 
discussed above.  Upon attaining the periodic state, the periodicity of the flow and thermal fields 
depends on the shape of the object, such that the period of oscillations is shortened to 
Nω
π2 , with N 
being the number of axes of symmetry of the object (i.e. 3, 4 and ∞  for triangle, square and circle, 
respectively).

The streamlines for three rotating objects at Re = 31 are shown in Figure 4 after the flow has 
attained the periodic state.  In comparison to the flow patterns of Figure 3, the flow field in the 
vicinity of the rotating square and triangle objects are more disturbed.  The streamlines near the 
cavity walls become dissimilar to the extent that the near-circular streamlines for the case of the 
circle transform into wrinkled closed curves for the square and triangle objects.  The recirculating 
vortices at the four corners for the case of the circle are identical, whereas these vortices become 
dissimilar and naturally will evolve with time for the square and triangle objects.  This, in turn, 
causes the fluid to flow very fast near the cavity walls in comparison with the corresponding 
rotating circle with the same Reynolds number.  This “periodic channelling” of the flow will 
undoubtedly affect the thermal field, to be discussed below.  
 
3.2 Periodic Temperature Field 
 
The temperature contours corresponding to the time instant exhibited in Figure 2 for the rotating 
squares having achieved their periodic states with Re = 111, 44 and 21 are shown in Figure 5.  Note 
that the contour level increment for the temperature field is 0.05.  In the absence of the object and 
with no primer for convection, a pure-conduction temperature field would have been observed.  
These would have been equally-spaced vertical lines.  It is observed that the rotational motion of the 
object greatly modifies the purely-conductive mode of heat transfer and the temperature contours 
are skewed.  The extent of skewness becomes more marked as the rotational Reynolds number is

Transient variation of the average Nusselt numbers on the left and right walls during the last five 
cycles for the case of a rotating triangle with Re = 111 and 31 are shown in Figure 8.  For the cases 
with Re greater than 91, a quasi-periodic behavior is exhibited (top row of Figure 8) very similar to 
a rotating square, with the dominant period of oscillations being equal to 1/3 of ω
πτ 2= .  At the 
same time, high-frequency oscillations are also observed for these operating Reynolds numbers.  
For Reynolds numbers equal to and less than 74 (e.g. bottom row of Figure 8), periodicity of the 
system beating at 1/3 of τ  is clearly observed.  A phase shift between the Nusselt numbers on the 
left and right walls of the order of π  is observed for this specific case.

One would expect that for higher values of the Reynolds number, the Nusselt number will 
asymptotically approach 1/2, irrespective of the shape of the object.  The distinction among the 
three rotating shapes become clear as the size of the object is increased and the Reynolds number is 
lowered.  As the diameter of the circle is increased (keeping angular velocity constant), the heat 
transfer rate is raised reaching a maximum about Re = 44.  Further increase of the diameter of the 
circle degrades the heat transfer rate since the object acts a resistance to heat transfer.  However, the 
square and triangle objects behave differently exhibiting monotonic rise of the heat transfer rate.  
This is due to the “periodic channelling” of the flow on the four sides that allow the distance 
between the side and the vertices of the square and triangle objects to vary with time.  For the 
Reynolds number range ( 80Re ≤ ), the rotating circle exhibits the lowest heat transfer among the 
three objects, whereas the triangle exhibits the highest heat transfer. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The important conclusions of this computational study are: 
 
1. The evolving flow fields for the rotating objects exhibit the shearing initiated on the surface of 
the object that then diffuse and transport away toward the walls of the cavity. 
 
2. Upon attaining the periodic state, recirculating vortices at the four corners of the cavity are 
observed.  The similarity of these vortices for the case of the rotating circle is compromised for the 
case of square and triangle as the hydraulic diameter is lowered.  For low Reynolds numbers, the 
vortices will exhibit time-dependent spatial growth and decay.

Abstract 
 
Computational analysis of transient phenomenon followed by the periodic state of laminar flow and 
heat transfer due to a rotating object in a square cavity is investigated.  A finite-volume-based 
computational methodology utilizing primitive variables is used.  Various rotating objects (circle, 
square and equilateral triangle) with different sizes are placed in the middle of the cavity.  A 
combination of a fixed computational grid with a sliding mesh was utilized for the square and 
triangle shapes.  The motionless object is set in rotation at time t = 0 and its temperature is 
maintained constant but different from the temperature of the walls of the cavity.  Natural 
convection heat transfer is neglected.  For a given shape of the object and a constant angular 
velocity, a range of rotating Reynolds numbers are covered for a Pr = 5 fluid.  The Reynolds 
numbers were selected so that the flow fields are not generally affected by the Taylor instabilities 
(Ta < 1750).  The evolving flow field and the interaction of the rotating objects with the 
recirculating vortices at the four corners are elucidated. Similarity of the flow and thermal fields for 
various shapes is discussed. Transient variations of the average Nusselt numbers on the surface of 
the rotating object and cavity walls show that for high Re numbers, a quasi-periodic behavior due to 
the onset of Taylor instabilities is dominant, whereas for low Re numbers, periodicity of the system 
is clearly observed.  Time-integrated average Nusselt number of the cavity is correlated to the 
rotational Reynolds number and shape of the object.  The triangle object clearly gives rise to high 
heat transfer followed by the square and circle objects. 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
Control and regulation of convective flows through active and passive means is extremely 
important to design of heat exchange systems.  To this end, variations of these techniques in a 
simple square cavity addressing lid-driven flow (Shi and Khodadadi, 2002), buoyancy-driven 
convection within differentially heated cavity (Shi and Khodadadi, 2003) and forced convection 
within a cavity with inlet and outlet ports (Saeidi and Khodadadi, 2006) have been studied.  In 
addition to the simplicity of the square cavity geometry, these flows exhibit simultaneous existence 
of diverse flow regimes involving boundary layers and multiple separated regions.  Many practical 
problems can be simplified as a cavity model.  These include design of mixing chambers, cooling of 
electronic components, ventilation of buildings, design of solar collectors, thermal storage, etc.

shapes if they possess the same hydraulic diameter.

To simulate the flow field generated by a rotating circular object, a boundary condition of velocity 
magnitude equal to Rω  is imposed on the hollow surface of the circle.  Regarding the flow induced 
by the rotating object with the shape of square or equilateral triangle, the method of sliding meshes 
is employed.  In utilizing a sliding mesh, one does not need to re-grid at each time step, so that the 
grid number is always the same.  The computational domain is divided into two parts: one is the 
rotating zone and the other is the stationary region.  The rotating zone is defined as a circle region 
encompassing the square or equilateral triangle object.  A grid interface to connect both regions 
needs to be defined.  Once the simulation starts, the rotating zone moves along the grid interface 
and rotates the hollow square or triangle object, while the grids in the stationary region are kept 
motionless. 
 
It takes the time period ω
πτ 2=  for an object to rotate one revolution. After conducting a time-step 
independence test, the time-step for numerical simulation was chosen as 240/τ . Grid-independence 
test for a rotating hollow circle at Re = 111 is performed by six grid densities (1200, 2352, 4800, 
9480, 19200, and 37632 cells).  The numerical results reveal that the relative errors for both average 
skin friction coefficients and average Nusselt numbers on the surface of the rotating circle and 
cavity walls decrease with the increase of grid density.  The difference between the numerical 
results based on the 19200 and 37632 cells was insignificant.  The grid-independence test proved 
the numerical robustness of FLUENT in solving this problem and a grid density with 19200 cells 
was employed for the production runs. 
 
 
3.  Results and Discussion 
 
The transient leading to periodic flow and thermal fields for the posed problem are discussed now.  
Starting with an initial field discussed above, the object started to rotate at t = 0.  The simulations 
were progressed with a time increment equal to 240/τ  and the relevant convergence criterion were 
discussed in a previous section.  The number of cycles for various rotating objects to reach periodic 
or quasi-periodic states is shown in Table 1.

3.1 Periodic Flow Field 
 
The evolving flow field surrounding an object that starts to rotate at time t = 0 will be dependent on 
the shape of the object and the imposed Reynolds number.  Upon setting the object into rotation, a 
thin shear layer is formed adjacent to the surface of the object.  This shearing layer will grow with 
time and eventually affect the fluid that is placed farthest from the object.  The flow patterns 
 
The flow patterns for three rotating objects at Re = 31 are shown in Figure 4 after the flow has 
attained the periodic state or quasi-periodic state.  In comparison to the flow patterns of Figure 3, 
the flow field in the vicinity of the rotating square and triangle objects are more disturbed.  The 
flow patterns near the cavity walls become dissimilar to the extent that the near-circular flow 
patterns for the case of the circle transform into wrinkled closed curves for the square and triangle 
objects.  The recirculating patterns at the four corners for the case of the circle are identical, 
whereas these vortices become dissimilar and naturally will evolve with time for the square and 
triangle objects.

at the end of a cycle 
 
 
The flow patterns for rotating circle and square with Re = 12 are shown in Figure 5.  It should be 
noted that a triangle with the same hydraulic diameter can not physically be sustained in the cavity, 
so no case was simulated for Re = 12 and 21.  Comparing the two flow patterns, the stagnant low-
speed vortices at the four corners are permanent features for these cases.  For the case of a rotating 
square, the distance between the walls and the four vertices will vary with time.  This, in turn, 
causes the fluid to flow very fast near the cavity walls in comparison with the corresponding 
rotating circle with the same Reynolds number.  This packing of the flow field will undoubtedly 
affect the thermal field, to be discussed below.

3.2 Periodic Temperature Field 
 
With different Reynolds numbers, the temperature contours of a rotating triangle reaching the 
periodic state or quasi-periodic state are displayed in Figure 8. Similar to the temperature field of 
the square object, larger temperature gradients appear at three corners of the rotating triangle, 
resulting from the flow disturbance happening there. Away from the rotating triangle, the 
disturbance of flow field disappears gradually, resulting in smooth isothermal lines. Unlike the 
vortices of the circle and square objects at wall corners, these vortices of the triangle are 
asymmetrical and have unequal strength. When Re ≥ 44, the strength of the vortices at wall corners 
is small, so that the isothermal lines are basically smooth near wall corners. For the case with 
Re=31, the isothermal lines within the cavity are seriously distorted by the vortices occurring at the 
corners of the rotating triangle and wall corners.

3.3 Instantaneous Nusselt Numbers on the Surface of the Rotating Object and Cavity Walls 
 
Transient variation of the average Nusselt numbers on the surface of a rotating square and cavity 
walls during the last five cycles with Re = 111 and 31 are shown in Figure 9.  For the cases with Re 
greater than or equal to 74, the Taylor numbers are of the order of 1250 and higher. The onset of 
Taylor instabilities for these cases are clearly observed and a nearly periodic behavior is observed 
on the surface of the rotating object with the dominant period of oscillations being equal to 1/4 of 
ω
πτ 2=  (e.g. top row and left column of Figure 9 with Re = 111).  On the other hand, for similar 
Reynolds numbers, quasi-periodic variation of the instantaneous Nusselt numbers are exhibited on 
the walls of the cavity (e.g. top row and right column of Figure 9 with Re = 111).  At the same time, 
high-frequency oscillations are also observed for these cases.  For Reynolds numbers equal to and 
less than 58 (e.g. bottom row of Figure 9), periodicity of the system beating at 1/4 of τ  is clearly 
observed on the surface of the object and walls of the cavity.  For low Reynolds numbers, there is 
also a phase angle associated with the variations of instantaneous Nusselt numbers, with the wall 
values falling behind the values on the object. 
 
 
Transient variation of the average Nusselt numbers on the surface of a rotating triangle and cavity 
walls has similar trend to that of the case of a rotating square.  The dominant period of oscillations 
for the case of a rotating triangle is equal to 1/3 of ω
πτ 2= .  
 
Except the smallest two Reynolds numbers, the curves of >< cNu  vs. Re for three objects are 
piecewise linear. When Re is greater than 58, the three curves are almost identical. For Re < 58, 
they start to deviate and increase suddenly with the decrease of Re. From the flow patterns, it can be 
found that the strength of vortices occurring near wall corners increase with the decrease of Re. As 
the strength of vortices increases, the spread of thermal waves from the cavity wall toward the 
rotating object is enhanced, resulting in the sudden increase of average Nu on the cavity wall. The 
triangle shape clearly exhibits superior heat exchange capability among the three objects that were 
studied.

averaged Nusselt number of the cavity is correlated to the rotational Reynolds number and shape of 
the object. 
As shown in Figure 10(b), >< cNu  vs. Re can be correlated as the following form:
