境，若依照間隔數的多寡可簡單分為 Level 
1（間隔 1個路段）、Level 2（間隔 2個路
段）、Level 3（間隔 3個路段）等數個層

Installation）。 
本研究將應用路段流量推估動態 O-D
的方式，求得無佈設偵測器之路段流量，
並以平滑權重的方式估算各路段之行車速
度，再將前述兩觀測變數輸入以卡門濾波
為基礎之動態旅行時間預測模式進行路徑
旅行時間之推估；嘗試討論不同偵測器密

角度架構不同影響因子之情境，利用融合
修正後之預測路徑旅行時間與錄影真值，
比對進行績效評估，找出明顯改變旅行時
間推估誤差的因子。 
 
三、研究方法與模式建構 
1. 全路段旅行時間模式 
A. 路段旅行時間推估模式 
Oh（2003）以路段流量守恆觀念，當
路段上、下游兩個相鄰之偵測器在可蒐集
有效的車輛數時，將兩個偵測器所測得之
到達車輛數相減，並再利用已知的路段
長，在即時給定的點資訊中即可算出真實
的路段密度。此時，使用路段上、下游兩
點偵測器蒐集資料之流量、密度平均值，
推估空間平均速度換算成路段旅行時間，
該模式最終型式如下式

四、研究成果 
為提供用路人具品質之旅行時間資訊
並兼顧實務成本考量，故本研究藉由不同
情境模擬與因子分析，歸納出不同交通情
境下的偵測器佈設策略；並在有事件情境
之下，除了 KF旅行時間預測模式之外，尚
整合不同旅行時間資訊來源（GPS 旅行時
間），主要目的即為建立適切的旅行時間
預測運作機制，以掌控與提昇交通資訊服
務。實證數據整理如表 1，相關研究成果則
分述如后： 
1. 研究中構建之求解目標函式，經績效驗
證後，平均絕對誤差低於 15％在合理範圍
內，符合基本要求。 
2. 動態旅行時間預測模式，以台 1線及台
15 線兩種不同路型之實際調查資料進行分
析並與真值比對，平均誤差皆低於 20％，
顯示在常態車流及偵測器數量限制下，若
路段偵測器數量不足，仍可透過本研究所
建構之模式，提供優良的預測品質。 
3. 無資料融合情境：不同飽和度下之事件

生卻無進行資料融合時，提供以下兩種佈
設策略： 
◆策略一：密集（Level 1）佈設方式之平均
預測誤差約為-23.6％。 
◆策略二：中等及較疏（Level 2、3）的佈
設方式之平均預測誤差約為
-30.5％。 
4. 加入資料融合情境：以飽和度因子對旅

◆策略一：密集及較疏（Level 1、3）的佈
設方式之平均誤差約為-3.3％ 
◆策略二：中等（Level 2）佈設方式之平均
誤差為-17.4％ 
5. 有事件情況之下，加入資料融合對於旅
行時間預測有大幅提升效果，且經由成對 T
檢定證明(如表 2)資料融合前後有顯著差

料融合以提升整體旅行時間估計之品質。 
   
五、結論 
對於旅行時間預測績效分析部份，本
研究以實驗設計的方式考量不同因子的影
響，得到下列幾項重要結論： 
1. 在無事件下的各種情境組合，無論是否
有資料融合，模式已能提供優良之預測品
質，因此實務應用上可考慮不加入外部資
料融合之機制。 
2. 當事件發生時，動態路徑旅行時間預測

ABSTRACT 
Dynamic travel time forecasting on an alternate path is recognized as valuable information for 
drivers switching to another route.  However, insufficient installment of sensors especially on 
arterials is usually suggested by local government due to the limited budget.  Therefore, model 
that can solve problems of dynamic travel time forecasting on alternate paths with only incomplete 
detector data is asked with great attention. This paper suggests dynamic origin-destination matrices 
estimation approach to construct the link flow dynamic relationships, and applies adaptive Kalman 
filter process to adjust the error.  Finally, evaluations of several real cases are provided to illustrate 
the performance of the suggested approach.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Traffic information on alternate paths is recognized as an effective strategy to alleviate congestion 
on major highway by balancing traffic volume among the network.  However, insufficient 
installment of sensors especially on arterials is usually suggested by local government due to the 
limited budget.  Based on the current sparse data from detectors, estimated traffic information can 
hardly integrate into useful information.  As a consequence, the development of ATIS (advanced 
traveler information system) in Taiwan on arterials is still stagnant. 
Path travel time is commonly defined in terms of a set of link travel time as well as its associated 
intersection delay.  It is generally agreed that numerous factors affect travel time on arterial links.  
These factors are usually hard to incorporate into modeling process and thus make the estimation of 
travel time on arterials with huge errors.  There have been attempts to utilize detector data and 
signal timing phase to estimate arterial link travel time.  Employing the Q-K-U relationships, 
many works (Dailey, 1997, Son, 1998, Oh, 2003) tried to develop the estimation on link travel time.  
Due to the intersection delay likely affected by the coordinated signal timing phase, Lee (2004) 
proposed the stochastic model to estimate the path travel time.  After extensive investigations and 
experiments (Liu et. al, 2006), link travel time estimated by Oh model (2003) plus Akcelik (1980) 
intersection delay model was suggested for signal arterials in northern Taiwan because of good 
performance and easy implementation with detector data.

Considering the time lag of the real journey time as fig. 1 (right), the route consists of five links in 
sequence.  With link flow and spot speed, each link travel time can be estimated/forecasted by eqn. 
(2).  When One O-D flow enters the first link at interval k, it may cover 3 time intervals from k to 
k+2 passing the study area.  In fig. 1 (left top), link flow changes at each time interval because of 
flow in and out at different intersections, and speed (fig. 1 left bottom) on each link may changes 
smoothly. These parameters combined together depict the vehicle movements on route dynamically. 
Therefore, the dynamic flow pattern in space could be established.   
Without sufficient installment of sensors, traffic parameters of a few links on an alternate path may 
be incomplete.  Given a pair of detector data at the two ends on the path (e.g. the first and last link 
on fig. 1), O-D flows once passing the first detector could be expected to be appeared on the 
downstream link with detector in some another time interval later if given with precise dynamic

The filtering estimation at time interval t can be considered as ‘weighted’ adjustment between the 
new measurements (observed link flow and speed) and the predicted state vector (travel time) based 
on the dynamic path travel time and all previous measurements. 
 
SOLUTION ALGORITHM 
 
Step1. Put the observed traffic parameters into Oh plus Akcelik model to get the travel time of links 
with detector on route. 
Step2. Initialization (for link without detector data) 
 14
in middle without data, and level three with only two vehicle detectors installed at the both ends of 
these five links (fig. 4). 
Result and discussion 
 
To validate the model performance, there are numerous ways to check the system critical factors. 
For convenience, link flow is the most commonly used index because it can be observed in real 
time.  However, traffic volume is meaningless to drivers, and the error rate of link flow is usually 
smaller and does not stand for the error rate of travel time.   Dynamic travel time of path includes 
both estimation for current traffic conditions and forecasting for those happenings in the near future 
simultaneously.  Although real time estimation even perfectly matches without error, it does not 
guarantee to remain this situation dynamically for the part of predictions when observed in the near 
future.   
There are two commonly used performance indexes as follows to check the model performance.  It 
is agreed that MAPE is much more strictly than PE.  In the field of traffic control, the threshold of 
tolerant error in PE format remains unclear right now though, it is accepted with 85% accuracy in 
traffic volume counts for vehicle detector quality investigation.  In this paper, we employ the real 
time announced path dynamic travel time to compare the quality of prediction. The predicted value 
is derived from suggested approach with incomplete detector data.  The vehicle movements are 
recorded by video and this true value is thus matched by license plate number.   Therefore, the 
real dynamic travel time can be defined as vehicle passing through the whole study area, and it 
usually happens in a few time intervals later.  The normal travel time for study area is around 4 to 
5 minutes.  To get large sample size, the sampling strategy chooses one minute interval to update 
traffic information and reflect the dynamic characteristics. The evaluation of model performance is 
under offline operation.   ( ) ( )%100

( ) ( )%100
 value trueDV
 value trueDV- valueprediction ×=PE          (14) 
The blue line is prediction value by proposed AKF and the red line is survey data and calculated by 
manual and titled as DV true value (fig. 5 to fig. 7).  Therefore, the difference in absolute value 
divides by DV true value named as MAPE.  Scenarios for detector layouts on five links in 
sequence can be split into three levels referenced from fig. 5 to fig. 7 for briefly summary.   All 
combinations of model performance tests are list on table 5 and table 6. 
The model estimation for both ends with detector data perfectly matches in real time; however, 
when checked on the part of prediction happening in several time intervals later, the MAPE overall 
is between 0 and 20%, and its average is 9.3%.  From the link base points of views at one-minute 
time interval, model performance is excellent (table 5).  
In practice, path dynamic travel time is the most meaningful information for driver’s concern.  To 
evaluate the quality of travel time forecasting is challenging work because real dynamic travel time 
can rarely be observed except for using either huge amount of GPS probe vehicle or license plate 
number matching techniques.  MAPE of dynamic travel time forecasting in table 6 overall shows 
between 10% and 30%, and its average is 14.7% upon one-minute time interval base also.  It is 
worthy of mentioned that the first trial of sample for model evaluation has no reference of historical 
data.  The forecasting is based on the trend of moving average by using previous measurements in 
30 minutes.  Furthermore, the last three cases all have historic data for reference, surveyed at the 
same time period one week ago.  To compare with these two cases with/without historic data 
adjustments, it is clearly to see that model performance can be enhanced around 10% with fining 
tune-up.  These values of MAPE show that proposed approach is capable for further real time and 
online implementation.

ABSTRACT 
This paper aims to develop the strategy of the distribution of detector layout on alternate route.  
Based on the assumption of incomplete detector installation, we apply factorial design analysis 
combined with path travel time estimation algorithm to test the density layout of vehicle detector 
installation under different levels of saturation flow and with/without the incident and data fusion. 
Finally, the stategies of density layout are presented for different scenarios with errors below 
certain threshold.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Advanced traveler information system (ATIS) designed to predict travel times and delays have 
primarily been implemented in larger metropolitan areas.  Dynamic information of alternate routes 
to time-sensitive traveling public is recognized as the best strategy to alleviate the congestion by 
changing their predefined routes.  It is the final choice to improve the level of service and to 
balance the flow pattern within the network. Constrained to the budget limit, highway agency can 
not distribute the detectors fully on the road network.  Based on the current sparse data from 
detectors, estimated traffic information hardly integrates into useful information.  As a 
consequence, the development of ATIS on arterials is still stagnant. 
The freeway system is the backbone of transportation in Taiwan area. Due to the recurrent 
congestion of this system, the Directorate general of highways, MOTC is asked to provide dynamic 
information on the major alternate routes with accuracy. Although many undertaken studies on 
ATIS have been conducted for years in Taiwan, however, their emphses were always on freeways. 
The length of highway under MOTC authority currently is over eight thousand kilometers long, 
each segment of which has different attributes in some degree around all islandwide. With limited 
annual budget, how to make the detector allocation effective and to provide qualified  dyanamic 
information of alternate paths  soon become the top issue on the problem list.   
without data fusion.  Its corresponding models can be formulated as follows.

Data fusion  
 
There are two basic approaches used to collect real-time travel information.  One approach relies 
on collecting information at isolated but frequent locations.  Previous mentioned vehicle detectors 
fall into this category including inductive loop, infrared, video, microwave radar. They are capable 
of collecting information like vehicle volumes, time mean speed, headways, vehicle classifications, 
and lane occupancy.  The other approach used to collect real-time information relies on 
instrumented vehicles travelling in the traffic stream.  The instrumented vehicles, also known as 
probe vehicles, maintain frequent communications with a central computer that tracks the vehicle 
speed and location along the travel route.   
Although the density layout of vehicle detector is our primary issue, it could not adequately 
response traffic conditions in all circumstances without the helps of other probe vehicle 
information.  
There are numerous techniques which are recognized usefully for data fusion, including Bayesian 
inference, voting fusion, Dempster-Shafer evidence reasoning, and neural network. For 
convenience and availability of relative data sources, we employ entropy base concept to integrate 
these different source information.  The procedure is listed as follows.

Result and discussion 
 
Dynamic travel time of alternate route includes both estimation for current traffic conditions and 
forecasting for those happenings in the near future simultaneously.  Although the adaptive filtering 
technique is commonplace right now, to connect these links with incomplete detector data plus 
extra data fusion to response the complicated traffic conditions is still not an easy work.  Both the 
optimization searching algorithm and adaptive Kalman filtering algorithm are combined to make 
the forecasting of dynamic information of alternate route workable.   The computer outputs after 
tremendous labour intensive efforts are shown as table 3 and table 4 for all scenarios with/without 
data fusion. 
The normal acceptable threshold of detector for traffic control purpose has error rate of 15% 
maximum on traffic counts.  There has not common acceptable rule been developed yet for travel 
time estimation and forecasting.   In the first field survey of this study, one testing floating car 
equipped with GPS travels along the defined alternate route with space mean speed by driver’s 
personal judgement in experience.  However, due to the influence of signal timing, the floating 
vehicle with either stop or pass the intersection on the downstream gives the real travel time 
compared with total average by license plate number matching with difference around 25% as 
shown in fig. 3.   Link travel time is usually underestimated if testing car passing intersection 
without stop because at least a few vehicles should meet red signal and stop somehow in the time 
interval.  Therefore the total average link travel time should be longer than that of the testing 
vehicle.  Otherwise, it will be over-estimated while meeting the red light.      
Using proposed approach, dynamic information forecasting of alternate route for regular condition 
has maximum error rate around 12% (table 5), and the error of average is below 4%.  Overall 
speaking, the loose installation of detectors still gives excellent performance in normal condition.  
Based on ANOVA of EMS analysis in table 6 for cases without data fusion, the density layout of 
detector, incident factor under different saturation flow levels, and cross interaction of previous 
factors mentioned are significant.  On the contrary, the saturation flow factor is insignificant and 
without cross interaction with density layout of detectors.   
After incorporating the traffic incident, the overall forecasting quality drops quickly (fig. 4).  Even 
though the dense installation of detector improves the forecasting quality, it still has error rate 
23.6% in average (table 7).   
With extra probe vehicle information, the hypothesis tests tell that saturation flow levels still have 
not significant with forecasting performance.  The other related cross and nested interactions are 
significant in terms of error rate (table 8).  It is not apparent performance enhancements for traffic 
condition without incidents.   For incident cases, data fusion at low saturation flow has less 
improvement because of probe vehicle’s biased information.  On the other hand, data fusion at 
high saturation flow, however, has some improvements for their information close to the true value 
(fig. 5).   
If the error rate of GPS floating car in the field test is acceptable, strategies for density layout of 
detectors can be drew in general that the defined loose density layout can give good forecasting 
performance in normal condition.   With traffic incident, dynamic information of alternate route 
still has reasonable good quality if employing data fusion scheme.   At low saturation flow with 
traffic incident, only dense layout of detector can provide fair information for traveling public. 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
After extensive discussion above, results lead to several significant conclusions. 
1. Suggested approach provides good travel time forecasting, with error less than 12%.  
2. The density layout of detectors at loose installation has reasonable good quality in normal 
condition without the needs of data fusion.
