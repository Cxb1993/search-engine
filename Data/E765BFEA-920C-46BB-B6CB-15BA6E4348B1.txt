(二) 報告內容 
一、前言 
In the last two years, we have developed a new device structure, which is capable of LWIR detections by 
using InAs quantum dots (QDs). With the insertion of InGaAs capping layers after QD growth, the additional 
InGaAs quantum-well (QW) state has provided an alternate quantum state between the QD excited states and 
the wetting-layer (WL) state, which has effective extended the detection wavelength to 8 µm. By further 
reducing the InAs QD height, the reduced energy level difference has extended the detection up to 10-15 µm. 
The results have been demonstrated and published in several journals. The main focus of the project this year 
is on the broadband detection and practical thermal imaging application of the InGaAs-capped quantum-dot 
infrared photodetectors (QDIPs). The measurement technique can be further extended to the application of 
microscopic thermal imaging for small objects such as living organs or cells.     
  
二、研究目的 
    In this report, the influence of QD height distribution on the detection wavelengths of InGaAs-capped 
QDIPs is investigated. For the device with 2.8 mono-layer (ML) InAs coverage, the observed 7.6 µm 
detection wavelength is resulted from the dominant larger InAs QDs with average dot height/diameter 
9.0/50.8 nm. For the device with 2.0 ML InAs coverage, 10.4 µm detection wavelength is observed due to the 
dominant smaller dot height/diameter 4.4/42.7 nm. With the combination of ~ 8 and ~ 10 µm detection 
wavelengths contributed by the larger and smaller InAs QDs, 6-12 µm broadband detection is observed for the 
device with 2.4 ML InAs coverage. The results have demonstrated that by simply randomizing the QD height 
distribution, InGaAs-capped QDIPs with broadband detection can be achieved without additional device 
structure design. 
 
三、文獻探討 
    Compared with conventional quantum-well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs), quantum-dot infrared 
photodetectors (QDIPs) have already demonstrated advantages including high-temperature operation [1], [2] 
and insensitivity to incident light polarization [3], [4]. QDIP focal-plane arrays for thermal imaging 
applications have also been demonstrated [5], [6]. However, due self assembled QDs are adopted for the 
device, QD size control is always a challenge for QDIPs. In this case, the detection wavelength tuning for 
QDIPs is not as flexible as QWIPs and for most QDIPs, the detection wavelengths are limited at the 
mid-wavelength infrared range (MWIR; 3-5 µm). The lack of QDIPs operated at the long-wavelength infrared 
range (LWIR; 8-12 µm) makes the devices incapable of multi-color and broadband detections covering both 
infrared ranges. To improve this disadvantage, InGaAs-capped QDIPs are proposed, which have demonstrated 
the capability of wavelength tuning from MW- to the LW- IR ranges [7-9]. As discussed in the previous 
 5 
The 1 × 1 µm2 atomic force microscopic (AFM) images of InAs QDs with the same growth conditions 
as samples A and B are shown in the Fig. 1 (a). As shown in the figure, different QD size distributions are 
observed for the two samples. For sample A, smaller average dot height/diameter 4.4/42.7 nm are observed, 
while larger numbers 9.0/50.8 nm are observed for sample B. Similar dot densities 1.62 and 2.43 1010 cm-2 are 
observed for samples A and B, respectively. Although in theory, QDs are of zero volume and 
three-dimensional quantum confinements are expected, nm-size heights with several tens of nm diameters are 
commonly observed for common QD structures. In the case of samples A and B, with increasing InAs 
coverage from 2.0 to 2.8 ML, the dot height can be one times increase while only ~ 20 % diameter increase is 
observed. Therefore, the variation of QD height should be the main issue determining its energy levels. The 
QD height histograms of InAs QDs with the same growth conditions as samples A and B are shown in Fig. 1 
(b). As shown in the figure, most dot heights of sample A are distributed between 4-6 nm, while 7-9 nm is 
observed for sample B. The results suggest that with increasing InAs coverage, the additional In adatoms 
would migrate to nearby InAs QDs and undergo nucleation such that larger QDs are observed for sample B. 
The normalized 10 K spectral responses of devices A and B at 2.0 V are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in 
this figure, the peak detection wavelengths of InGaAs-capped QDIPs would shift from 10.4 to 7.6 µm with 
InAs coverage increased from 2.0 to 2.8 ML. As discussed in the previous report, the intra-band transition 
between the QD excited state to the quantum-well (QW) ground state of the InGaAs layer is responsible for 
the observed peak detection wavelength [7]. In this case, with increasing InAs coverage, the increasing dot 
height as shown in Fig. 1 would lead to the excited state lowering in the InAs QD region. Therefore, with the 
same InGaAs layers, the energy difference between the QD excited state and the InGaAs QW ground state 
would be larger for device B than device A. This is the main reason why a shorter peak detection wavelength 
is observed for device B. The phenomenon of QD height dependent wavelength tuning for the InGaAs-capped

The normalized 10 K spectral responses of devices A, B and C are shown in Fig. 4. As shown in the 
figure, broad detection wavelength from 6-12 µm is observed for device C. Since the heights of the two QD 
groups observed for sample C are close to sample A and B, respectively, the spectral responses have revealed 
a combination of both devices A and B at the same applied voltage. The results have confirmed that the main 
issue determining the detection wavelengths of the InGaAs-capped QDIPs is the dot height. Broadband 
detection can be easily achieved via this structure with broadened dot height distribution. 
Since the major application for the QDIPs is on thermal imaging, a single-detector raster scan system is 
established to demonstrate the possibility of InGaAs-capped QDIPs for this application. The system setup is 
shown in Fig. 5 (a). As shown in the figure, a 20-period InGaAs-capped QDIP with similar structure as device 
B is mounted on an L-N2 cooled Dewar flask. With an OPHIR 8-12 µm manual lens with 50 mm focus length 
and F number 1.0 in front of the device, the single detector is mechanically moved on the focal plane by using 
a computer-controlled X-Y stage. A Stanford Research SR570 low-noise current preamplifier is used to 
convert the current signal to voltage and recorded by the computer. With step moving distance of 100 µm in 
both directions, the thermal image of a hot solder head can be obtained via this approach. The image is shown 
in Fig. 5 (b). For reference, the picture of the solder head is also shown in Fig. 5 (b). The results have 
demonstrated the possible application of InGaAs-capped QDIPs in thermal imaging systems. With the same 
nature of high-temperature operation and insensitivity to incident light polarization of QDIPs, multi-color and 
broadband detections can also be achieved by using this structure. 
    In conclusion, the influence of QD height distribution on the detection wavelengths of InGaAs-capped 
QDIPs is investigated. For the device with 2.4 ML InAs coverage, broadband detection combining the 
responses of the two devices with 2.0 and 2.8 ML InAs coverage are observed. The results have confirmed

is observed for this device, which is compatible with the values obtained for 
CVD-prepared films. The results have demonstrated that by using MBE, the growth 
temperature of graphene films can be greatly reduced to 300 oC and the unique 
material characteristics of graphene can also be maintained. 
Room-Temperature Photoluminescence Intensity Enhancement of Type-II 
GaSb/GaAs Quantum Rings Separated by Thin GaAs Layers (TuA-3-3) 
Two orders of magnitude room-temperature PL intensity enhancement is 
observed for GaSb QRs separated by thin 5 nm GaAs layers, which is attributed to the 
enhanced electron confinement of the thin 5 nm GaAs layer between two QR 
structures. The larger blue shift of the sample has also confirmed this attribution.

GaSb/GaAs Quantum Rings (TuP-59) 
Room-temperature electro-luminescence up to 1.3 µm is observed for a GaAs 
PIN diode with In0.15Ga0.85As-capped QR active regions. The InGaAs capping layers 
have provided lowered conduction band edge for long wavelength emission and better 
electron confinement for luminescence enhancement. 
 
    We have also submitted three manuscripts to the conference proceeding, which 
will be published in a special issue of Journal of Crystal Growth. They are also 
attached to this report. We believe that through the continuously attending the 
international MBE conference and communication with the researchers all over the 
world in this area, our research works will attract more and more attention in the 
international stage.

1. Introduction 
 With the huge number of papers published in the last few years, the research on 
graphene has become one of the most fast-growing topics in the world [1]-[8]. With 
its unique characteristics, graphene has revealed its potential in the applications of 
semiconductor, biosensor and material industries. To obtain this material, different 
approaches are developed such as exfoliation from highly ordered pyrolytic graphite 
(HOPG) [1]-[3], SiC sublimation at high temperature [4]-[6] and chemical vapor 
deposition (CVD) on metal templates [7]-[8]. To obtain large-area graphene films for 
practical applications, SiC sublimation and CVD growth is the most common 
approaches adopted since HOPG exfoliation can only obtain graphene flakes. 
However, for the former approach of SiC sublimation, it would take place at a 
temperature ~1400 oC and leave the carbon (C) atoms on the surface for 
graphitization. Although this method does provide large-area graphene films, the high 
price of SiC substrates and the only substrate choice would limit the practical 
application of this approach. Compared with the previous approach, CVD grown 
graphene on metal templates has provided a cheaper and layer-number-controllable 
approach to obtain large-area graphene films. In CVD growth method, Ni and Cu 
templates are commonly used for film growth. With different growth mechanisms of 
the metals, different growth temperatures are required. When graphene is grown on Ni 
4 
 
atomic C source, while such mechanism cannot take place on complete amorphous C 
films. 
 
2. Experiment 
 Two samples with different fabrication procedures are discussed in this report.  
The flow charts of the fabrication procedures of the two samples are shown in Fig. 1 
(a) and (b), respectively. In Fig. 1 (a), 100 µm Cu foil is annealing in a 1000 oC 
furnace with Ar/H2 mixture gas for 10 minutes. The pressure is kept at 7 torr and the 
flow rate of Ar and H2 are set at 150 and 500 sccm, respectively. For the MBE growth 
procedure, the samples are transferred into a home-made MBE system equipped with 
Ribar PG filament cell in less than 30 seconds. To deposit the C atoms, the cell 
temperature is set at 2173 oC. After 30 minutes of growth, the sample is transferred 
out of the chamber, which is referred as sample A. In Fig.1 (b), similar procedure is 
performed on the other Cu foil except a 100 nm ploymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) 
film is spin on the sample surface before send into the furnace for high temperature 
annealing. The sample is referred as Sample B. The PMMA applied in this 
experiment is A5 from Microchem. And the Raman measurements are performed by 
using a HORIBA Jobin Yvon HR800UV spectrum system. The STM image is taken 
by using a RHK-SRM 100 system under ambient circumstances.

high-temperature decomposition of hydrocarbon gas following by adatom segregation 
and then graphitization [9]. However, for MBE-grown graphene, since atomic C 
atoms are already provided, high-temperature hydrocarbon gas decomposition is no 
longer required. In this case, low-temperature growth will become one important 
advantage of MBE-grown graphene. However, considering the low substrate 
temperature 300 oC as the case of sample A, C adatom migration on the surface 
should not be as free as the case at higher temperatures. Therefore, a growth model is 
proposed for low-temperature grown graphene. The schematic diagrams showing the 
graphene growth evolution is depicted in Fig. 4. In the initial step, although the 
substrate temperature is low, the high-temperature C atoms accelerated by the PG 
filament should have sufficient energy to form graphene flakes on the surface. With 
the graphene flakes as the crystal seeds, lateral growth of graphene with following C 
atom supply would gradually form a complete graphene film on the surface. However, 
due to lack of sufficient C adatom migration, possible crystal defects may appear on 
the boundaries connecting neighboring graphene flakes. This is the main reason why 
D-peak is still observed in the Raman spectrum. To overcome this disadvantage, 
growth condition optimization is still required in the future. 
Since low-temperature graphene is achieved by using the atomic C source, it 
would be interesting to see if they can improve the crystalline quality of amorphous C 
8 
 
annealing. Similar MBE growth condition is applied on the amorphous carbon film. 
No significant improvement on the film quality is observed. The low substrate 
temperature is the major advantage for graphene growth by using MBE, which is 
helpful for the practical application of graphene.

Abstract 
Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) and the corresponding carrier 
dynamics of standard and coupled type-II GaSb/GaAs quantum rings (QRs) are 
investigated in this article. Compared with standard QRs, the slower PL intensity 
decay of coupled QRs with increasing temperature is attributed to the depression of 
thermal quenching. More intense PL intensity is also observed for the coupled-QR 
sample at room temperature. With further reducing the GaAs spacer layer thickness to 
2 nm, near two-times PL enhancement is observed. The results indicate that with the 
enhanced luminescence intensity of coupled-QR structure, type-II nano-structures 
may be utilized for light-emitting device applications.

electrons away from the GaAs/GaSb interfaces. However, the temperature-dependent 
behavior of the structure has not yet been investigated. In this article, temperature- 
dependent PL and the corresponding carrier dynamics of standard and coupled type-II 
GaSb/GaAs QRs are investigated. Compared with the standard QRs, the slower PL 
intensity decay with increasing temperature is observed for the coupled-QR sample. 
With further reducing the GaAs spacer layer thickness to 2 nm, near two-times PL 
enhancement is observed. 
 
2. Experiments 
The samples investigated in this study were grown on (100)-orientated 
semi-insulated GaAs substrates by using Riber compact-21 solid source molecular 
beam epitaxy (MBE) system. In this system, both As and Sb effusion cells adopt 
valved crackers to control the amounts of As and Sb flux. Two samples with 
three-period GaSb/GaAs QR embedded in GaAs barrier layers were prepared, which 
are referred as samples A and B. For sample A, it is a standard GaSb QR sample with 
50 nm GaAs separation layers between each GaSb QR layer. For sample B, it is a 
coupled-QR GaSb sample with 5 nm GaAs separation layers between each GaSb QR 
layer. The detailed sample structures are listed in table I. To obtain the whole GaSb 
QR morphology, well controlled Sb and background As ratios were adopted during 
 5 
type-II transitions [13]. However, with increasing temperature, the higher-energy PL 
peak drops faster as compared with the lower-energy PL peak for both the two 
samples. When the temperature rises beyond 110 K, there would be only one 
dominant peak appeared for the two samples, which is attributed to the luminescence 
from the GaSb QRs. In this case, compared with the QR luminescence, the 
higher-energy PL peaks of two samples should be resulted from the recombination 
mechanism of the faster increase of electron escaping probability away from the 
interfaces at higher temperatures. Therefore, we would attribute the lower-energy 
peak as the transition from the electrons to the localized holes of GaSb QRs while the 
higher-energy peak as the transition from the electrons to the localized holes of GaSb 
wetting layers. The fitted activation energy by using the Arrhenius equation is 
adopted to verify this attribution [14]. 
The integrated PL intensities of QR and WL transitions of samples A and B 
under different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3. According to the fitting results, the 
activation energy of QR peaks of samples A and B is nearly the same as ~300 meV. 
The activation energy of WL peaks for samples A and B is also nearly the same as 
~50 meV. Therefore, it proves that the lower- and higher-energy PL peaks are 
resulted from the electron-hole recombination of the QR and WL structures, 
respectively. Similar results have also been observed in previous literatures [14, 15].

in the same range. For temperatures above 150 K, the interactions between the loosely 
confined electrons and phonons would induce the dramatic increase of FWHM, as 
observed for sample A. For sample B, the PL FWHM continually drops from 92 to 86 
meV in the temperature range of 10-170 K. For the temperatures above 170 K, slow 
increase of PL FWHM is observed for the sample B. The results suggest that the 
localized holes in the coupled QR structure may hop vertically to the nearby QRs due 
to thermal activation. In this case, the holes would redistribute and accumulate in 
larger QRs. The hole redistribution at low temperatures would depress the FWHM 
broadening effect resulted from QR size non-uniformity, which would lead to the 
decrease of PL FWHM of QR of sample B in the temperature range of 10-170 K. For 
temperatures above 170 K, as the sample A, the same electron-phonon interaction 
would result in the FWHM broadening for sample B. However, since the 
tensile-strained GaAs spacer layer between the two GaSb QR layers provides a better 
confinement for electrons [12], the FWHM broadening of sample B at high 
temperatures is less significant, as sample A. 
Since the coupled-QR structure would exhibit more intense luminescence 
intensity than the standard QRs at room temperature, it is possible that by further 
reducing the GaAs spacer layer thickness, more intense PL intensity can be observed. 
To verify this assumption, the other coupled-ring sample with a thinner GaAs spacer 
 9 
intensity can still be obtained for type-II heterostructures by providing better electron 
confinement. The demonstration of intense luminescence of the type-II coupled-QR 
structure is advantageous for their application in optical devices with the unique 
characteristics.

Abstract 
The room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) 
exceeding 1.3 µm are observed for InGaAs-capped GaSb quantum-ring (QR) 
structures. With incresing In composition, the emission wavelength would shift from 
1.18 to 1.31 µm. The InGaAs-capped GaSb QRs also exhibit a higher injection 
current and stronger EL intensity at the same applied voltage. With the observation of 
low-temperature PL spectra, the transition mechanisms of the standard and 
InGaAs-capped QRs are further investigated.

In this article, we investigate the influence of In composition of the InGaAs 
capping layers on the performance of type-II GaSb/GaAs QR structures. With 
increasing In composition of the InGaAs capping layer, a red shift of PL peak is 
observed at room temperature. Also observed is the larger blue shift of the 
InGaAs-capped QR structure in the same pumping power span, which suggests a 
higher number of electron-hole pairs accumulated at the interfaces. The transition 
mechanisms of standard and InGaAs-capped GaSb/GaAs QRs are investigated with 
the observation of PL spectra at low temperatures. By fabricating the sample into a 
diode, a longer EL emission wavelength and an intense EL intensity are observed for 
the InGaAs-capped QR structures. 
 
2. Experiment 
The samples investigated in this study were grown on (100)-orientated 
semi-insulated GaAs substrates by using a solid source molecular beam epitaxy 
system. In this system, the As and Sb sources both were adopted to a valve cracker 
cell to control the atom flux. Three 3-period GaSb/GaAs QR samples with different 
capping layers of GaAs, In0.1Ga0.9As and In0.15Ga0.85As were prepared, which are 
referred as samples A, B and C, respectively. The wafer structures are shown in Table 
I. After growing a 200-nm thick buffer layer at 580 oC, the substrate temperature was 
 5 
between electron and hole states is observed. On the other hand, no PL signal resulted 
from the type-I InGaAs QW is observed in this figure, which indicates that the optical 
recombination probability of electron-hole pairs in the InGaAs QW is smaller. A 
possible mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is the easy relaxation of holes 
from InGaAs QW to GaSb QRs. In this case, the dominated PL peak observed in Fig. 
1(a) is resulted from the optical recombination of localized holes in QRs and the 
electrons in InGaAs QW. To verify if the PL peak is resulted from type-II transitions, 
the PL peak energies of samples A and C as a function of the cubic root of laser 
pumping power density are shown in Fig. 1(b). In this figure, while similar PL peak 
energies of ~1.04 eV are observed for sample A, a larger blue shift of 20 meV in the 
same pumping power span is observed for sample B. This result is attributed to the 
increase of electron-hole pairs accumulated at the (InGa)As/GaSb interfaces, which is 
resulted from the better confinement of the InGaAs capping layer over electrons. The 
same mechanism also results in the 100 times stronger PL intensity of sample C than 
sample A. Similar results have also been observed in another literature of coupled 
GaSb QRs [13]. 
To further investigate the transition mechanisms of the samples, the 10 K PL 
spectra of samples A, B and C at a laser pumping power of 0.5 W/cm2 are shown in 
Fig. 2(a). In this figure, except for the already observed red-shift peak with increasing 
 7 
may easily escape to bulk GaAs region. However, for InGaAs-capped QRs as the 
cases for samples B and C, the InGaAs capping layer provides a potential well for 
electron confinement. It will be more difficult for electrons to diffuse away from the 
(InGa)As/GaSb interfaces. This is the main reason why more intense PL intensities 
are observed for samples B and C. As for the transition mechanisms, since QR and 
WL signals are both observed in the 10 K PL spectra of the three samples, there 
should be at least three confinement states existed for sample A. They are Ehole,QR, 
Ehole,WL and the confinement state Eelectron,GaAs in the GaAs triangular well. The 
possible transition pathways for sample A should be between the Eelectron,GaAs and 
Ehole,QR/Ehole,WL as shown in Fig. 3(a). Compared with the 10 PL spectrum of sample 
A, the WL PL peak is missing from the 300 K PL spectrum. The phenomenon is 
attributed to the lower activation energy of the WL hole state such that the holes may 
diffuse out of the WL region easily at room temperature. As for the case of 
InGaAs-capped QRs, the insertion of the lower-bandgap capping layers would 
provide a lower conduction-band edge such that the longer emission wavelengths are 
observed for samples B abd C. The InGaAs potential well will also provide a better 
electron confinement. Therefore, there should be at least four states existed for the 
InGaAs-capped QRs. They are Ehole,QR, Ehole,WL and the confinement states 
Eelectron,InGaAs and Ehole,InGaAs in the (InGa)As QW as shown in Fig. 3(b). The dominant

recombination probability of electron-hole pairs such that more intense EL intensity is 
observed for device C than that for device A. This result has demonstrated that the 
InGaAs-capped GaSb QRs is capable of the light-emitting device applications. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In conclusion, over 1.3 µm intense EL spectrum at room temperature of 
InGaAs-capped GaSb QRs is observed. By measuring the PL spectrum at low 
temperatures, the PL transition mechanisms for standard and InGaAs-capped GaSb 
QRs are further investigated. Compared with the standard GaSb QRs, InGaAs-capped 
GaSb QR structures exhibit a higher injection current and a more intense EL intensity. 
This result demonstrates the great potential of the structure in the application of 
near-infrared light-emitting devices.
