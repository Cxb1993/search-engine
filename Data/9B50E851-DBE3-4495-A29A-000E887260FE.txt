ABSTRACT 
P-type transparent CuAl1-xCaxO2 thin films were prepared by rf-sputtering at room 
temperature without any additional post-annealing processes. The replacement of 20 % of the Al 
with Ca in the Cu-Al-O thin films improved the electrical conductivity of the films by two to 
three orders of magnitude, yet further increasing the quantity of Al beyond 20 % had a 
detrimental effect on conductivity. The activation energy for electrical conductivity was reduced 
as conductivity increased. The CuAl1-xCaxO2 was then used as p-type material for the transparent 
heterojunction pn diode, with ZnO as the n-type material, in conjunction with indium tin oxide 
(ITO) and Al doped ZnO films as the contact layers. This room-temperature sputter-deposited 
heterojunction diode had a turn-on voltage of ~1.9 V and a rectification current ratio of 2.5x103 at 
bias voltage of ±5V, and it exhibited good average optical transparency in excess of 70 % in the 
visible range. 
 
INTORDUCTION 
P-type CuAlO2 semiconducting oxides were first reported in 1984 [1]. In 1997, Kawazoe 
used pulse laser deposition (PLD) to make CuAlO2 thin films on a substrate at a temperature of 
700 oC [2]. Since that time, this research topic has attracted a great deal of attention due to the 
need for p-type oxide materials to realize versatile oxide electronic devices [3–15]. CuAlO2 and 
several other delafossite p-type oxides have been used in conjunction with ZnO to make 
transparent heterojunction pn diodes [16–23], such as p-CuAlO2/n-AlZnO [16], p-CuAlO2/n-ZnO 
[17–19], p-CuCrO2:Mg/n-ZnO [20], p-SrCu2O2/n-ZnO [21], p-CuYO2/n-ZnO [22], and 
p-AgCoO2/n-ZnO [23]. 
CuAlO2 films have been deposited using several deposition methods, such as pulse laser 
deposition (PLD) [2–4], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [5–6], and sputtering [3,7–9]. All of 
these processes have involved processing temperatures in excess of 450 oC, with the objective of 
achieving a high degree of transparency and room temperature (RT) conductivity greater than  
10-2 S·cm-1. As pointed out by Tsuboi et al., a high temperature annealing process influences 
transmission mainly in the short wavelength region, changing the film color from brown to 
transparent [9]. Processing temperature influences the transparency of CuAlO2 films as well as 
the conductivity. CuAlO2 film, fabricated with a sputtering process at 100 oC, has an RT 
conductivity value of ~10-3 S·cm-1 [12], while a sputtering process at 180 oC increases the RT 
conductivity to ~0.8 S·cm-1 [13]. Reddy et al. studied the effect of substrate temperature on the 
physical properties of dc-sputtered CuAlO2 films [14]. Their study showed that an increase in 
substrate temperature from 100 oC to 300 oC during sputtering, the RT resistivity decreased from 
34.1 ·cm to 1.95 ·cm, while the transmittance increased from ~20% to ~60% at a wavelengt　 　 h 
of 500 nm. Other CuAlO2 film synthesis techniques have also been used to reduce process 
temperature. For instance, the spray technique by Bounzidi et al. [10] and the ion exchange 
method using LiAlO2 by Dloczik et al. [11]. However, these processes still required processing 
temperatures of >300 oC.

pressure cases, despite the amorphous nature of our deposited films, the direct optical bandgap of 
films deposited from CuAlO2 targets, were ~3.5 to 3.6 eV, close to those reported in the 
literatures [1–2,13]. The direct optical bandgap of films deposited from CuAl0.9Ca0.1O2 target is 
~3.4 eV, which is ~0.2 eV lower than those of films deposited from CuAlO2 targets. This is 
similar to the CuAl1-xMgxO2 studied by Dong et al. [25], the addition of Mg into CuAlO2 led to a 
reduction in optical bandgap. When the quantity of Ca substituted for Al was increased to 20%, 
the Eg decreased to ~3.2 eV. Further increasing this proportion beyond 20% increased Eg instead. 
The ratio of sputtering source gases (O2/Ar) showed no significant effects on the optical bandgaps 
of the deposited films. Although Deng et al. indicated that oxygen partial pressure influences the 
crystal structure and phase separation of PLD-processed CuAlO2 [26], our room-temperature 
processed CuAlO2 and CuAl1-xCaxO2 films showed no indication of phase separation. 
Fig. 1(b) plots the resistivity of CuAl1-xCaxO2 films versus O2/Ar ratio. The resistivity of 
CuAl1-xCaxO2 films dropped considerably as the O2/Ar ratio increased from 0 to 33%. A further 
increase in oxygen partial pressure showed little effect on the conductivity of sputtered films. 
This agrees with the defect reaction that excess oxygen atoms causes in the conductivity of 
CuAlO2 material [6,13,27]:

obtained from other studies [2,4–5,13,16,24,27].  The activation energy was reduced when Al 
was substituted by Ca, and in general the amount of reduction was positively correlated to the 
amount of substitution. At temperature below 200 K, conductivities followed a T-1/4 rule, which 
suggested the presence of gap states close to the Fermi level and a variable-range hopping 
mechanism was dominant [2,28].

We further applied the room-temperature rf-sputtered p-CuAl1-xCaxO2 thin films to produce 
transparent heterojunction diodes. The inset of Fig. 4(a) illustrates the geometry of the diode. The 
diode was composed of a 200 nm ZnO:Al, a 100 nm ZnO, and a 100 nm CuAl0.8Ca0.2O2 thin 
films on a commercial ITO-coated glass substrate. This heterojunction diode processed entirely at 
room temperature exhibited a rectification ratio of 2.5x103 at ±5V with an optical transparency 
exceeding 70% averaged between 400 nm to 700 nm, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The turn-on voltage 
of this diode was ~1.9 V. The electrical and optical performance of our room-temperature 
processed diode shows that CuAl1-xCaxO2 is promising for flexible transparent large-area 
electronic applications.

一、參加會議經過 
The 2009 Fall Meeting of Material Research Society (2009 Fall MRS) was held in 
Boston USA from Nov. 29 to Dec. 04, including one day tutorial, five days of research 
seminars and exhibitions. There were twelve tutorial sessions, fifty-one parallel technical 
sessions and several events held in the conference. During the conference, we presented one 
technical paper on “Influence of polarization effects in the electrical properties of 
polycrystalline MgZnO/ZnO heterostructure” in the symposium H: ZnO & Related Materials. 
Our research topic had gained attentions from the symposium attendees, questions and 
comments have been raised after our oral presentation. 
 
The technical sessions covered from large-area electronic technology, advanced materials 
for spintronics, III-V materials, organic materials and optoelectronic devices, formation of 
nano-structured materials and their applications in photovoltaics and thermal-electrical energy 
conversion, oxide-based materials and devices, carbon-based materials (including diomand, 
graphene and carbon nanotubes), microscopy and spectroscopy technologies, to biological 
related materials. Compared to Spring Meeting, fundamental material sciences and 
technologies were more emphasized than their device applications. In the exhibition, products 
as well as equipments for material-related researches, including fabrication and 
characterization, were demonstrated. The attendees included many experts as well as prospect 
young researchers from academia, government laboratories, and industry from all over the 
world. 
 
二、與會心得 
During the six day conference period, many novel materials and their fundamental 
sciences and applications in electronics and optoelectronics had been discussed and presented. 
Among various technical presentations, the following topics were most interesting to me. 
 
First is the “ZnO and related materials”, which is the research topic we are working on 
currently. Lots of the presentations focused on fundamental material sciences of epitaxial 
ZnO-related materials by molecular beam epitaxial technique or pulsed laser deposition at 
high process temperatures and their applications in optoelectronics, such as UV detection or 
luminescence. Properties, such as surface/interface polarities, Schottky or ohimc contacts, 
electrical and magneto transport characteristics, and deep and shallow levels, had been 
discussed extensively in the symposium. Study on electrical and optical performances of 
devices with quantum confinements was another important subject. In addition, from the 
impressive and promising results presented on pulsed-laser deposited ZnO thin film transistor 
in RF applications showed that high-performance ZnO-based electronics would be an 
interesting topic for us to pursue next.

Next was the research area related to “thin film transistor based nonvolatile memories.”
Several research groups from the United States and Korea had presented their works on this 
topic. The basic idea of the devices is using a semiconductor layer or nanoparticles embedded 
in gate dielectric as the floating-gate. Once there are carriers trapped in the floating gate, the 
threshold voltage of the device changes. By evaluating the hysteresis of the transfer 
characteristics, the memory function of the device can be determined. The channel material 
can be amorphous silicon, amorphous oxide semiconductors, or organic semiconductors. The 
material for floating gate can be silicon-based or II-VI-based semiconductors. In particular, a 
group from Princeton University demonstrated a functional memory device using defect states 
which were intentionally created by plasma process as the floating gate. Surprisingly, their 
devices had showed a pretty high retention-time and also low drain voltage dependence of the 
saturation current in comparison to a typical amorphous silicon floating gate thin film 
transistor.  
 
Last was the “novel/new oxide semiconductor” for transparent, low-temperature 
large-area electronic applications. Amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide had been shown as a 
promising channel material for thin film transistors by many research groups all over the 
world. It has the advantages of good temperature stability, good bias-stress stability, and 
sufficient high carrier mobility for display applications. However, due to the patent issue, 
during the conference several research groups had presented their works on exploring new 
oxide semiconductors. One of the promising materials was amorphous hafnium gallium zinc 
oxide. The thin film transistors based on this type of material with good carrier mobility had 
been demonstrated. However, further research efforts were still needed for the improvement 
on the electrical and environment stabilities.
