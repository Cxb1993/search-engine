use of mutation to both speed up convergence and escape local minima will be also examined in this work.  
 
Literature Review 
Zueco et al. [2] studied the unsteady inverse heat transfer problem in a one-dimensional geometry 
subjected to a time-variable incident heat flux by means of the numerical network simulation method (NSM). 
Polynomial functions are assumed for the temperature dependencies of the thermal properties, conductivity 
and specific heat. Two different types of incident heat flux waveforms, including triangular and rectangular, 
has been determined. Huang and Wu [3] investigated the one-dimensional transient inverse heat conduction 
problem by the conjugate gradient method (CGM) in estimating the unknown boundary heat flux. Instead of 
employing the conventional parabolic differential equations for the heat transfer, a hyperbolic heat equation 
model was used and analyzed. 
Identification of thermal conductivity and the shape of an inclusion for a two-dimensional solid body 
were considered by Ardakani et al. [4]. The particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), coupled with the 
boundary elements method (BEM), is used to implement this inverse heat conduction problem. Abboudi and 
Artioukhine [5] proposed a numerical approach for simultaneous estimation of two boundary conditions in a 
two-dimensional linear heat conduction problem. The inverse numerical algorithm is based on the iterative 
regularization method and on the conjugate gradient method (CGM). Unknown functions are parametrized in 
the form of a cubic B-spline. An optimal choice of the matrix of the descent parameters is used at the iterative 
regularization method. 
Haghighi et al. [6] studied two-dimensional transient inverse heat conduction problem of functionally 
graded materials (FGMs). A combination of the finite element (FE) and differential quadrature (DQ) methods 
is employed for solving the direct problem. The inverse analysis using conjugate gradient method (CGM) is 
transformed into the solution of three problems; namely, the direct, sensitivity, and adjoint problems. These 
three problems are also solved by the coupled DQ-FE method. 
The surface heat fluxes on the cutting edges of cutting tools are estimated in the three-dimensional 
inverse heat conduction problem by Huang and Lo [7]. The steepest descent method (SDM) with adjoint 
equation and a general-purpose commercial code were successfully applied in determining the time-dependent 
 5
difference between the measured temperatures at the external surface of the cylinder and computed 
temperatures produced by the numerical model in equations (1a)-(1e). The solution of the present inverse 
problem is to be obtained in such a way that the following objective function f (q) formulated as a 
sum-of-squares of residuals is minimized:

Particle Swarm Optimization 
  Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic optimization technique, introduced by Kennedy and 
Eberhart [10] in 1995, which draws inspiration from the social behavior of a flock of birds or the collective 
intelligence of a group of social insects with limited individual capabilities. The basic particle swarm model 
consists of a swarm of m particles moving about in problem search space, each particle of which is a potential 
solution of the global optimum over a given domain D.  For a n-dimensional search space the position of the 
ith particle is represented as Xi = (xi1, xi2, …, xin). At each iteration, the new particle position was found by 
adding a displacement to the current position, the displacement being the particle velocity multiplied a time 
step of one as shown in eq. (3) 
11   ninini VXX         (3) 
Where 1niX  and 
n
iX  represent the current and previous position of particle i, 
1n
iV  is the current velocity 
of particle i and represented as Vi = (vi1, vi2, … vin). The velocity of each particle is also updated at each time 
step and is given by:

Where 1niV  and 
n
iV  are the current and previous velocity of particle i. Each particle maintains a memory of 
its previous best position Pbest = (pi1, pi2… pin). The best one among all the particles in the population is 
represented as Gbest = (pg1, pg2… pgn). The new velocity in eq. (4) can be seen as sum of three parts, first part 
of equation (4) represents the previous velocity, second part is the cognition part, third part represents the 
cooperation among particles and is called social component. Cognitive learning coefficient c1 and social 
learning coefficient c2 are known as accelerator factors, r1 and r2 are two random numbers generated with

The influence of the measurement errors on the inverse solutions is presented in Figure 3. The measurement 
errors on the temperatures are taken as 　=0.01,　 =0.05,and 　 =0.1 by the MPSO algorithm. The 
results show that reliable inverse solutions can be obtained for the cases of 　 =0.01 and　 =0.05. 
However, accuracy of predictions decreases when measurement errors increase. For the case of 　 =0.1, the 
results are still reliable.

An Application of Particle Swarm Optimization to  
Identify the Thermal Properties of Materials 
 
 
ABSTRACT 
An inverse analysis of identifying thermal properties for materials is presented. It is shown that the 
physical problem can be formulated as an optimization problem with differential equation constraints. A 
particle swarm optimization algorithm is developed for solving the resulting optimization problem. The 
proposed algorithm provides a global optimum with highly-improved convergence performance. Numerical 
results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The comparison to the modified 
genetic algorithm is also included.
