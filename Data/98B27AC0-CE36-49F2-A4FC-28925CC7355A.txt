(一) 中文摘要 
本計畫原為申請兩年期的計畫，第一年所提出的計畫內容是要比較正常人功能性磁振造影
(functional magnetic resonance imaing, fMRI)與近紅外光(near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS)訊號的異同，並
驗證 NIRS 運用在腦部功能性研究的正確性跟可行性。並在第二年的計畫中，利用此三種實驗器材，
建立量化、分類複雜性疾病之系統。由於本計畫只通過一年的經費補助，因此，我們將我們的實驗目
標著重在正常受試者資料的收集與分析，並利用 fMRI與 NIRS來收取正常受試者在觀看電影預告片時
的腦部訊號。我們期待利用這些收集的資料來測試 NIRS系統在尋找腦部功能性連結時的研究能力。 
在我們的 fMRI與 NIRS實驗中，所有的受試者都歷經了三種不同的觀視情況。第一種為休息狀態
(resting)，在此狀態中受試者被要求專心看黑色背景中央出現的白色十字符號。第二種為放鬆狀態
(relaxing)，在此狀態中，收視者須觀看一部自然風景影片。第三種為預告片觀賞狀態(trailer viwing)。 
利用 fMRI所收到的訊號，我們計算了各個腦區間的功能性連結的強度，而且，我們利用這些連結
的強度，建立了能代表不同狀態的代表性功能性連結網絡。我們利用統計檢定來檢查這些連結。最後，
對於觀眾給與預告片喜歡與否的反應，我們找到前額葉-邊緣系統的連結似乎跟喜歡一部預告片有關聯
性。然而，前額葉-皮質下間區的連結則跟受試者不喜歡一部預告片的反應有關。這些因為喜歡或不喜
歡的反應所造成的腦部連結改變，可以用來當做評斷一部電影預告片是否具有吸引力的生物指標。    
我們從 NIRS 的訊號中發現，腦部位於額葉與枕葉的局部連結位因為受試者處於不同觀視狀態而
有所改變。 在正相關性中強度區間，休息狀態擁有較多的連結。此外，休息狀態比起放鬆與預告片觀
賞狀態也有較少的低相關性連結數。在比較前後兩個不同時間點的休息狀態訊號後，我們也可以發現
受試者的心理狀態及生理狀態會隨著實驗時間拉長而改變，主因是實驗器材帶給受試者的不適感。因
此，在未來的研究中如何把這影響給降到最低是非常重要的。

(三) 報告內容 
3.1 前言與研究目的 
Brain is a mysterious structure. In the past, many scientists tried to figure out how brain works and what 
role the brain plays in one man’s daily activities. But its complexity hindered the progress of finding. 
Fortunately, with the improvement of modern scientific experiment instruments and approaches in recent 
decades, we can gradually unravel the secret threads gyrated in our brain. During this period, a lot of works 
have been done by other researchers to get a clearer understanding of our complicated brain functions. 
Functional network can be defined as the cooperation and communication between different brain regions 
when the brain is doing a specific task [1, 2]. In the past, a bunch of network patterns have been found related 
to a certain tasks like mental arithmetic [3], memory formation [4], etc. Besides, the dysfunction of brain 
networks was reported to be correlated with diseases [5, 6]. Therefore, if we can find out and define more 
functional networks of brain, then we can take a further step to fully understand the mechanism of our 
mysterious brain. 
Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) had been widely 
used to explore brain activities and functional networks. Many researchers not only used them to find out a 
specific brain region related to a certain task but facilitate the diagnosis and staging of diseases. Near infrared 
spectroscopy (NIRS) [7] is a relatively new tool compared to EEG and fMRI. Although the history of NIRS is 
still young, it has already shown its promising potential. Albeit the penetrating ability of infrared light is not 
good so that the scope of signal we obtain from the subjects is limited, its temporal resolution is superb. We 
believe that it can produce signals different to fMRI [8]. The reason is that the signal obtained by fMRI is 
referred to as BOLD signal, namely, blood oxygen level-dependent signal. The BOLD signal is a result 
derived from regional magnetic field changes, which is mainly affected by the concentration of deoxygenated 
hemoglobin [8]. However, due to the nature of NIRS, we can obtain oxygenated, deoxygenated hemoglobin 
and total hemoglobin concentrations directly.  Therefore, we believe that using NIRS combined with fMRI 
can yield more information than using fMRI alone. 
Originally, we aimed to validate our NIRS system using fMRI and EEG data and further used these 
instruments to do some researches on the patients with complex diseases. But, we only got one year stipend 
for the 2 year project proposal. Therefore, we focused on healthy volunteers. In this study, we asked healthy 
volunteers to watch movie trailers and we obtain data using fMRI and NIRS. We aimed to find out brain 
network patterns when a subject processes the information during watching the movie trailers. If there is a 
certain network pattern disclosing whether a viewer likes the movie trailer or not, then this network pattern 
will be very valuable in neuromarketing field. We wanted to find out what kind of role NIRS can play in brain 
research and know its limitations.

fMRI Data Analysis 
A software package, SPM8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Imaging 
Neuroscience, London, UK, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), was used to analyze the collected fMRI data. 
The processing steps [9] included: (1) Slicing-timing difference was compensated for all images. (2) 6 
rigid-body transformation parameters were used to minimize head movement effect. (3) Spatial corregistration 
was performed on subjects’s fMRI images to their corresponding T1 images. (4) The images were further 
normalized to MNI 152 template. Then, we resampled the images to isotropic 2×2×2 mm. (5) At last, we used 
an 9-mm isotropic full width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel to smoothen the images and 
improve their signal to noise ratio (SNR).  
The preprocessed functional images were segmented into 90 cortical and subcortical regions of interest 
(45 for each hemisphere) using automated anatomical labeling (AAL) template for further functional 
connectivity analysis [10]. 
For each functional session, regional mean fMRI timeseries of each 90 regions was computed by 
averaging all voxels within each region at each time point in the time series of the functional images.  In 
order to correct several sources of spurious variances and the global brain signal, multiple linear regression 
analysis was applied on the fMRI time series with translations and rotations estimated from the image 
realignment of the image preprocessing section [10]. The high frequency physiological noises, such as 
respiratory and cardiac oscillations, aliased with the lower frequency signals, causing pseudo correlation; 
therefore, we band-pass filtered the mean fMRI time series between 0.01 and 0.1 Hz.  Moreover, we 
discarded the first seven and the last two time points to segment the representative fMRI time series of every 
functional session. 
Pearson correlation coefficient of each region pair was calculated as

where x_i and y_i were the representative fMRI time series of region x and region y, with means x ̅ and y ̅, 
respectively. i represented the time point. Finally we utilized a Fisher’s r-to-z transform to convert correlation 
coefficients toward the normality (r was the Pearson correlation coefficient). We constructed a 90×90 
correlation matrix which represented the functional connectivity status in a functional condition (Fig 2).

coefficients between two high-connected nodes. 
 
In order to examine the alteration of functional connectivity between conditions, we performed statistical 
analysis (paired-t test or Wilcoxon signed rank test) on the connectivity of the representative networks 
between conditions.  Only those significantly different connectivity (p value<0.01) were regarded as specific 
statuses or patterns in one condition when compared with another and were discussed further.  This is a 
qualitative analysis for functional networks. 
Network measures using graph theory was widely utilized to decode the functional network of human 
brain. Through the topological analysis of network properties, it provides a simple but robust mathematical 
framework to directly characterize and quantify the network organization of human brain. Here, we used the 
Brain Connectivity Toolbox (http://www.brain-connectivity-toolbox.net) to quantify and characterize the 
organization of functional networks in different conditions. Four network parameters were measured [11]: 
mean degree, mean clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and global efficiency. The mean degree is 
the average number of connections incident on a node in the network. The mean clustering coefficient was the 
average fraction of triangular connections around a node. This parameter measures the tendency of clustered 
connectivity within a network. The characteristic path length was the average shortest distance between each 
pair of nodes. It characterized the network integrity. The global efficiency was the average inverse shortest 
distance between each pair of nodes. It was a related measure to the characteristic path length. However it had 
properties of less affected by disconnected node and was with more meaningful parallel information 
processing. 
 
3.2.3 NIRS experiment 
Near Infrared Spectroscopy System Configuration 
A Dynamic Optical Tomography system (DYNOT, NIRx Medical Technologies LLC. NY, USA) was 
used to obtain near infrared data in this study. The system we used has 18 near infrared sources and 32 
detectors in total. We constructed a home-made fiber cap for frontal-occipital multi-sides study. The cap had 
two parts, one covering the frontal lobe and the other for the occipital lobe. Each part consisted of 4 arcs 
(three 11-hole arc and one 7-hole arc). We used threaded couplers to combine these arcs into one part. In the 
experiment, these two parts covering frontal lobe and occipital lobe were linked together with Velcro strips 
and fastened on the subject’s head like Fig 5 (right photo) displays.

7. Two movie trailers were used in the study. The first one is Dredd 3D 
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A6rB_uys9k&feature=player_embedded&hd=1), which release date in 
Taiwan is still uncertain at the moment and the second one is Silent Hill: Revelation 3D 
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-RbLTrmU88&hd=1), which release date in Taiwan is set to be on 
December 21th, 2012. The clip lengths are 146 seconds and 143 seconds respectively. Mandarin subtitle was 
provided when the subject watched the clips.

NIRS data analysis 
 Near-infrared Analysis, Visualization and Imaging (NAVI) software was used to process the raw data. 
The processing steps included: 1. We eliminated the signal which frequency sat outside 0.01~ 0.1 Hz using a 
band pass filter. 2. The signals from all channels were normalized based on the co-located light-source 
calibration. 3.The correlation coefficients of signals from different channels in different sessions, namely, 
resting session 1, relaxing session, trailer session1, trailer session 2 and resting session 2, were computed. 4. 
We examine the positive correlation coefficients in 10 different spans (0~0.1, 0.1~0.2, 0.2~0.3…0.9~1.0) and 
then we calculated how many networks which correlation coefficients are in these spans for the 5 different 
functional sessions. 5. Wilcoxon signrank test was used to compare the differences between different sessions.

very similar to that between the resting and trailer viewing conditions. It also demonstrated a pattern that 
altered connectivity of the resting condition spread to a wide range of brain regions, while the altered 
connectivity of the trailer viewing condition localized within the prefrontal regions.  Also, there were altered 
prefrontal-limbic, prefrontal-insula and prefrontal-subcortical connectivity of the trailer viewing condition. 
To investigate the alteration of network organizations, we quantified the functional connectivity network of 
each condition. Initially, we measured the four network parameters of the whole-brain network of each 
condition (Fig 12). The results show that between the resting-trailer viewing conditions, the mean degree, 
characteristic path length and the global efficiency had significant difference. Between the relaxing-trailer 
viewing conditions, the four parameters all had significant difference. By contrast, between the 
resting-relaxing conditions, the four parameters had no significant difference. 
Then, we further measured the four parameters of three interested sub-networks, the DMN, frontal 
network and the occipital network (Fig 13). The results show that within the DMN, the mean degree and the 
mean clustering coefficient had significant difference between the relaxing-trailer viewing conditions.  
Within the frontal network, the mean degree, characteristic path length and the global efficiency had 
significant difference between the resting-trailer viewing conditions and between the relaxing-trailer viewing 
conditions. However, within the occipital network, the network organization had no significant alteration 
between any two conditions. 
From the result of questionnaire, thirteen subjects felt that the movie trailer was attractive while fifteen 
subjects felt unattractive. To compare the functional connectivity stimulated by attractive and unattractive 
movie trailers, we used the data of thirteen subjects to construct the representative functional networks in 
response to attractive and unattractive movie trailers. 
Fig 14 displays the alteration of functional connectivity between responses stimulated by attractive and 
unattractive movie trailers. The functional connectivity in response to unattractive movie trailers demonstrated 
significantly altered connectivity between the prefrontal regions (the left inferior frontal gyrus – triangular & 
orbital part, right olfactory cortex) and the subcortical regions (the bilateral putamen, right pallidum), while 
the functional connectivity in response to attractive movie trailers demonstrated significantly altered 
connectivity between the prefrontal regions (the left superior frontal gyrus – orbital part, right inferior frontal 
gyrus – orbital part, right rectus gyrus) and the limbic system (the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, left 
middle cingulate cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex) and between the prefrontal regions and the parietal 
regions (the right inferior parietal gyrus, and the right angular gyrus).

3.2 NIRS results 
Fig 15 demonstrates the number of local networks on frontal side in different correlation conditions when 
the subjects were in the different functional sessions. Different colors of lines represent different functional 
sessions (red for resting session 1, blue for trailer session 1, green for trailer session 2, black for relaxing 
session and cyan for resting session 2). In Fig 15, the upper graph stands for the results derived from 
oxygenated hemoglobin concentration, and the lower graph was resulted from deoxygenated hemoglobin 
concentration. Fig 16, similar to Fig 15, displays the number of local networks in different correlation 
conditions in the different functional sessions but on the subjects’ occipital side. The comparison of network 
number in different functional sessions is done by using Wilcoxon test. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize the 
p-values derived from oxygenated and deoxygenated signals on the frontal side of head respectively. Table 3 
and Table 4 stand for the p-values on the occipital side. In Table 1-4, * indicates the p-value is lesser than 0.05 
and ** indicates the p-value is lesser than 0.01.

3.3 Discussion 
3.3.1 fMRI results 
The resting condition was a condition when people rested wakefully with stimulus-independent thoughts 
and didn’t engage in particular tasks [16]. There were enormous studies investigating the resting functional 
connectivity which suggested that it reflected the default cortio-cortical interactions and intrinsic 
neurophysiological properties [17]. Therefore, the resting condition usually served as a foundation to help us 
exploring how the brain functioned in complex cognitive tasks [18]. The relaxing condition was a condition 
that subjects rested wakefully and stimulated with a film without story line [19]. To better understand how the 
functional connectivity altered while watching movie trailers, we took the relaxing condition as a 
meta-condition that we could investigate how the functional connectivity altered and what the roles the altered 
connectivity might play. 
From Fig 9 (A) and Fig 10 (A), we pointed out that the functional connectivity status within the occipital 
regions of the resting conditions was similar when compared with the relaxing condition and when compared 
with the trailer viewing condition. The salient co-activation of the cuneus with other high-connected nodes 
 25 
The four parameters of the whole-brain network measured in the trailer viewing condition were all 
significantly different from that in the relaxing condition. Furthermore, three out of four parameters in the 
trailer viewing conditions showed significant difference from the network in the resting condition. These 
results indicated that the overall functional network was reorganized and relocated when subjects engaged in 
watching a trailer. The high mean degree, high mean clustering coefficient, high global efficiency and low 
characteristic path length of the whole-brain network in the trailer viewing condition exhibited that the brain 
network was reorganized into a highly efficient and cost-effective one [11]. In other words, the information 
processing of brain was more systematical in the trailer viewing condition that not only could deal with 
various types of complex information (visual and auditory stimuli with story line) but also could integrate all 
the process together to comprehend the story of a trailer. In contrast, in spite of the dynamic visual and 
auditory stimuli in the relaxing condition, the reorganization of the whole-brain network was not salient when 
compared with the resting condition. 
To further investigate the reorganization within local regions, we also measured the connectivity within 
the DMN, frontal and occipital regions. Within the DMN, the four network parameters didn’t have any 
significant difference between the resting-relaxing conditions and between the resting-trailer viewing 
conditions. However, the mean degree and the mean clustering coefficient in the trailer viewing condition 
were both significantly higher than that in the relaxing condition. The mean degree measured overall 
synchronization of functional fluctuation within a network. Therefore, it served as a marker to evaluate the 
average importance of nodes. The significantly higher mean degree in the trailer viewing condition reflected 
that the nodes within the DMN played a much more important role than that in the relaxing condition.  The 
mean clustering coefficient measured the presence of local clusters within a network which reflected the 
potential of functional segregation [27]. Functional segregation of human brain is the specialized processing 
of the densely connected brain regions. The significantly higher mean clustering coefficient in the trailer 
viewing condition suggested that the DMN would segregate into more different functions than that in the 
relaxing condition. 
Within the frontal network, the trailer viewing condition showed significantly higher mean degree, lower 
characteristic path length and higher global efficiency than that in the resting and relaxing conditions.  The 
characteristic path length and global efficiency estimated the potential of functional integration within a 
network [27]. Functional integration of human brain is the integration of specialized information from 
different clusters of brain region.  The significantly lower characteristic path length and significantly higher 
global efficiency in the trailer viewing condition suggested that the functional communication much more 
efficient than in the resting and in relaxing conditions.   
Within the occipital network, though there was a salient alteration of functional connectivity of the relaxing 
condition when compared with the resting or the trailer viewing conditions, however, the network measures 
didn’t show any significant difference.  
Based on the results of sub-networks, it was evident that the reorganization of whole brain network was 
largely attributed to the network alteration of frontal network. 
The altered functional connectivity in response to attractive movie trailers showed significantly different 
prefrontal-limbic and prefrontal-parietal connectivity, while the altered functional connectivity in response to 
unattractive movie trailer showed significantly different prefrontal-subcortical connectivity.  From the result 
of the altered functional connectivity status between conditions, we had identified the prefrontal-limbic and 
the prefrontal-subcortical connectivity as the specific patterns of the trailer viewing condition.  Therefore, we 
recognized that the prefrontal (the left superior frontal gyrus – orbital part, right inferior frontal gyrus – orbital 
 27 
 
(四) 結論與建議 
In this fMRI study, we computed the functional connectivity between distinct brain regions and 
constructed a representative network for each functional condition. In addition, we applied statistical analysis 
to identify significant difference of connectivities between conditions. Furthermore, we calculated four 
network parameters to explore the reorganization of the whole-bran network and sub-networks in every 
condition. In the trailer viewing condition, it demonstrated specific patterns of altered connectivity within 
prefrontal regions, between prefrontal-limbic, between prefrontal-insula, and between prefrontal-subcortical 
regions. The network measures demonstrated a pattern that the whole brain network was reorganized into a 
highly efficient and cost-effective one. Both the qualitative and quantitative results showed that the frontal 
network significantly altered in the trailer viewing condition. From the specific patterns of the trailer viewing 
condition, we further recognized that the prefrontal-limbic connectivity was related to the response toward 
attractive movie trailers, while the prefrontal-subcortical connectivity was related to the response toward 
unattractive movie trailers. In conclusion, from the functional connectivity analysis, we investigated how the 
human brain responded to a movie trailer and find out bio-indicators that could be used to evaluate the 
attractiveness of a movie trailer for the neuromarketing application. 
As for NIRS, larger data are needed to get a more consistent result. The alignment of light sources and 
detectors were not optimized. Some signal channels were at the same locations. It means that some channels 
were wasted. We can rearrange the locations of sources and detectors in the future to maximize the efficiency 
of this system. We can see that we have 144 signal channels in each cap part covering frontal or occipital side 
of head. It indicates that inevitably some channels are very close (1 cm away) to the others. Those channels, 
which were only spanned 1 cm, definitely have similar signal curves and we do not know these signals 
whether come from a single specific functional brain region. That is to say the correlation between 
neighboring signal channels can not really represent a specific functional network between different brain 
regions. A pitfall may occur when we calculate the number of network links but actually some links come 
from the same functional brain region. Therefore, that shows the importance of source localization in NIRS 
study. If source localization can be done in the future, we can correlate the signals with specific brain regions 
and produce tomographic images, which is greatly helpful for resolving the unclear brain network 
communications we obtained in NIRS data. In order to do this, we must develop a system to solve the light 
diffusion equation.  
We also suggest that when using home-made configuration of NIRS sources and detectors, you should 
make sure that the weight and the force given by the spring of light fiber do not cause too much discomfort to 
the subject. In addition, the duration of experiment must be controlled in a proper range. In our preliminary 
test, subjects always complained their head got hurt during the experiment. The feeling of pain got worse 
when the experiment proceeded. When the experiment was finished and the cap was taken off, some subjects 
had bruises on their foreheads. One subject even felt nausea, dizziness and headache so that we halted the 
experiment prematurely. Some subjects admitted that the pain distracted their focus on the experiment. The 
pain may affect the experiment results although in our study the result did not show great difference in the 
signal between NIRS resting session 1 and resting session 2. But, we can find that the curve of resting session 
2 in Fig 15 and Fig 16 had a trend to drop in the higher correlation range. It implies that with the time passed 
the condition of subjects may have changed and the results we obtained could be contaminated by this

Lasso為一個有效的特徵選取的方法，可從少量的樣本中找出有效的特徵幫助提升辨識率。然而因疾病
引起的大腦變化往往發生在比鄰地區，而不是孤立的影像畫素中，應慎重考慮空間連續性，因此作者
提出 hierarchical tree-guided group Lasso方法，將傳統的 Lasso做延伸並考慮影像中腦部結構資訊，並
應用於阿茲海默症的診斷分類。從他們的結果看來，阿茲海默症病人的辨識率可達到 88%~91%之間。
