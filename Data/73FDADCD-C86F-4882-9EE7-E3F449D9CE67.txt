The technological demands on these systems require a fundamental understanding of 
microscopic hydrodynamics, which may deviate from those in conventional flow at 
macroscales. The deviations between nano-scale and macro-scale flow characteristics are 
closely related to the atomistic information and still remain unclear; while the experimental 
evidence of high confidence is not available [1]. The major differences between the nanoscale 
and macroscale hydrodynamics stem from wall-fluid interactions. Therefore, many studies, 
either experimental or computational, focused on the interfacial phenomena in nanoscale 
flows. For example, the effect of the boundary slip, no slip and multi-layer sticking 
phenomena has been reported previously [2]. The presence of the fluid slippage will affect the 
hydrodynamics at interfaces. To study the interfacial phenomena in micro-/nanoscale systems, 
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a very useful method. Previous MD studies have 
revealed that the slip length may increase under the conditions of weak wall-fluid interactions 
[3], fluids of low density and/or at high temperature [4], high wall-density [5], large shear rate 
on the wall-fluid interface [6, 7], non-wetting boundary condition [8], etc. A latest MD study 
[9] disclosed that the wall lattice has significant effects on the fluid slippage in nanochannel 
flows. 
Although it is relatively weaker in macroscale flows, the electrokinetic effect is a 
significant point in manifestation of the discrepancy between micro and macro flow 
characteristics. As an electrolyte contact a charged wall, electric double layer (EDL) appears 
at the solid-liquid interface. In the Stern model of EDL, a thin compact layer (or Stern layer) 
attached on the solid wall and then a layer of mobile ions with diffusion-type distribution 
appears next. The potential at the interface between the two layers is conventionally called 
slip plane on which the electrostatic potential is named zeta potential and is usually regarded 
as a measure of wall surface potential. The characteristic thickness of the EDL is of the order 
O(1) to O( 210 )nm. Therefore, as the channel height reduces to the order comparable to that of 
EDL, the electrokinetic effect becomes influential to the hydrodynamics and has to be taken 
into account in the analysis.  
The electrokinetic flow can be driven by either pressure-gradient or electric field. When 
the electric field is applied, ions accumulated in EDL encounter electric body force, and the 
stationary electrolyte is brought into motion by viscous dragging force from the moving ions. 
This phenomenon is called electro-osmosis. Instead, as a pressure rather than electric field is 
applied, the fluid flow is driven and brings the ions into motion. This migration of the charged 
particles in the flow results in a streaming current and then streaming potential, which induce 
a conductive current against the main flow and in turn a retardation effect on the main flow. 
This class of pressure-driven electrokinetic flows is characterized by the streaming potential.  
Continuum models based on the Navier-Stokes (NS) and Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) 
equations have been employed for study of electrokinetic flows. In this class of continuum 
analyses, however, only the global characteristics but no microscopic behaviors were 
considered. In the past decade, on the other hand, a number of MD studies on electrokinetic 
flow at nanoscales have been performed. The pioneering MD simulation of EDL can be traced 
back to the earlier work by Spohr [10, 11], in which the electrochemical double layer between 
an aqueous NaCl solution and an idealized metallic surface was studied with only a few 
number of charged ions, e.g. 16 Na +16 Cl . Freund [12] analyzed electro-osmotic flow 
(EOF) with near-wall ion density and velocity distributions predicted from atomistic 
simulation and PB equation. Zhou et al. [13] found that the wall of model silica has little 
effects on the water axial movement and ions along the channel. Qiao and Aluru [14] 
disclosed that the effect of surface charge density on the electrokinetic transport in a 
nanochannel is significant. Kim and Dave [15] performed the nanochannel EOF with different 
types of surface roughness. They found that the zeta potential and flow rate both decrease 
with increasing amplitude and decreasing wavelength of the surface roughness.

dependence of zeta potential, ionic concentration, electric potential, velocity profile, 
streaming current/potential, flow rate, and the resultant electrokinetic retardation are also 
discussed.  
 
2. METHODOLOGY 
 
2.1 Molecular Dynamics Simulation 
 
To reduce the computational efforts and facilitate comparison with the continuum theory, 
in this study, both the ions and solvent particles are assumed spherical and non-polar. Then the 
fluid can be regarded as a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid with intermolecular/atomic forces 
described by using the noted Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential. Here the fluid-fluid and wall-fluid 
interactions are evaluated by using a function named ‘truncated and shifted Lennard-Jones 
12-6 potential’ [21], viz.

where the subscripts α and β denote particle species (w for wall atom, f for fluid particle, etc.). 
The parameter   and c  denotes interaction energy and attraction coefficient between 
species α and β. For wall-fluid interactions, wfc  = 1 is used. In evaluation of the fluid-fluid 
interactions, the condition of ffc  = 1.2 is employed, which implies more cohesive L-J fluids. 
The parameter r is the distance between two interacting molecules. For brevity, define 
ff   and ff  , respectively, as the characteristic energy and length scales in this 
molecular system. In practice, a cut-off distance 5.4cr  is chosen for compromise 
between computational cost and accuracy in evaluation of the interaction forces. The fluid 
temperature and density in reduced units are employed for convenience in comparison with 
continuum theory. The interaction of charges is governed by both LJ potential and Coulomb 
potential with constant permittivity d . The Coulomb potential between two charged 
particles can be expressed as follows,

where q  (or q ) is the charge valence of particle   (or β) and e is the elementary charge. 
In the evaluation of  , the Bjerrum length, 2 /(4 )B d Bl e k T , is used. This parameter 
Bl  is the separation distance at which the magnitude of the electrostatic interaction between 
two charges is comparable to the thermal energy scale. Follow the previous works [18, 19], 
the Bjerrum length is set as Bl   and the temperature is set as / 1Bk T   , whereby the 
Coulomb potential can be simplified to the form of

With the intermolecular/atomic forces evaluated with the potential functions mentioned 
above, the position and velocity of each particle can be obtained by integrating the Newtonian 
equation, 2 2/ /d dt mr F . The computer code employed in the simulation was developed by 
our group based on a velocity Verlet algorithm [21].   
The wall of the model channel is of face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure and 
 6
Y-direction is actually applied to the fluid particles in the outer layer of Y = 0.5~1.1 . The 
same thermostat is applied to the motion of wall atoms.  
Since the focus of this work is the influences of lattice plane on electrokinetic flow 
characteristics, to facilitate a simple analysis and save the computational effort, 
constant-property approximation is invoked in the present study. This approximation can be 
used for an isothermal system or at least for the case of thermal effects small enough. For the 
present model, we invoke the following assumptions. (1) The walls of the nanochannel lie at 
the same uniform temperature with appropriate thermostat addressed above. (2) The Joule 
heating is negligibly small, since there is no external electric field in the present 
pressure-driven flow and the streaming potential is generally weak. (3) The viscous heating 
effect is assumed small. Therefore, the temperature-dependence of the physical properties 
such as viscosity and permittivity are neglected. 
 
2.2 Continuum Expressions of Streaming Potential and Zeta Potential with Fluid

channel flow without external field applied on it, the field xE  is simply the streaming 
potential gradient. Combining with the Poisson equation, 2 2/ e dd dz    , and using the 
slip boundary condition, su u , and surface electrostatic potential, s  , at walls, the 
velocity distributions, u(z), can be solved, viz.,

In the above equation, s  denotes the surface electric potential with the presence of slip 
velocity su > 0. The slip velocity su  can be decomposed as a combination of the boundary 
slip without electrokinetic effect, ,0su , and the velocity slip due to the presence of the 
electrokinetic effect, 0( / ) [ ]d x sE     , where 0  is the surface potential corresponding 
to the non-slip condition. Therefore, one has su = 0( / ) [ ]d x sE     + ,0su , and the velocity

The right-hand-side of the last equation consists of four parts: (1) pressure-driven fluid

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
The influences of the EDL on the wall-fluid system can be dealt with in either static or 
dynamic point of view. Statically, the major concerns are the net charge density distributions 
and electrostatic potential; while for the dynamics, velocity profile, fluid slippage, streaming 
current/potential, and flow rate at various conditions are dealt with. The interfacial parameters 
considered in this work include the solid surface orientation, wall-fluid interaction energy and 
ion concentration. Table II shows the parameters considered in the present simulations. 
3.1 Static Property of the Electric Double Layer 
 
3.1.1 Validation of the present MD simulation  
The most similar flow configuration simulated is that in the work of Joly et al. [18]. 
Unfortunately, values of some parameters were not clearly given in their paper. For example, 
they did not show the exact values of fluid and wall densities ( 3f   and 3w  ) in the 
simulation but only claimed that both the values of 3f   and 3w   are around 1. In Fig. 2, 
our MD simulation results with the fluid and wall densities 3f  = 0.95 and 3w  = 1.3 are 
compared with the results of Joly et al. [18]. Although the previous data are not presented in 
the same frame with ours for the difficulty in reproducing the curves with fluctuations, but the 
comparison clearly shows good agreement of the present MD simulation with the previous 
one qualitatively as well as quantitatively. 
 
3.1.2 Ionic concentrations and net charge density 
Distributions of counterions and coions in the diffuse layer depend upon both the 
long-range Coulomb force and short-range van der Waals force. The ionic distributions are 
also influenced by the thermal motion of liquid particles and the presence of fluid density 
layering phenomenon. The theoretical models for EDL associated with flat surfaces and 
symmetrical electrolytes have been proposed in early studies and can be found elsewhere, e.g. 
the work of Israelachvili [25]. This class of theories describes the ion distributions adjacent to 
a charged surface based on the assumptions of (a) ions are point charges, (b) the ionic 
adsorption energy is purely electrostatic, (c) the electric potential can be identified with the 
Boltzmann equation, and (d) the permittivity is constant throughout the fluid. Considering the 
above assumptions for a nanoslit channel flow between two infinite plates, the 
Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for a space charge density on x-z plane can be reduced to 
the form of

in which n0 stands for the bulk concentration of ion, v for the valence (v = 1 in this study), d  
for the permittivity, e for the elementary charge, Bk  for the Boltzmann constant, T for the 
temperature and z for the direction perpendicular to the wall-fluid interface. In the present 
study, the salt or electrolyte concentration n0 is calculated by using the number of coions, N-, 
and counterions, N+ within the flow region, i.e. 0 /[ ( )]x y zn N N L L L      , where 
( )x y zL L L     is the volume of the flow domain. Besides, the permittivity can be expressed 
as 0d r   , where 0  is the permittivity in vacuum and r  is the relative permittivity of 
 10
orientations reveal the consistency in qualitative trend of peak ,e p  increasing with the bulk 
ionic concentration. This tendency also agrees with the analytic solutions of the 
Poisson-Boltzmann equation.  
Using the case of fcc (100) with electrolyte concentration 30n  = 0.0174 as an example, 
the influences of the interaction energy, /wf  , in the range from 0.2 to 0.8 are examined. It 
is observed that, for low values of /wf  , the wall-fluid interaction is weak and, therefore, 
the layering phenomenon is weakened and the peak value reduced. The continuum theory 
cannot account for the behaviors of individual particle and the different wall-fluid interactions 
for various lattice planes; therefore, there is only one analytic solution shown in Fig. 5. The 
comparison reveals that, at the conditions considered in the cases, the MD predictions of the 
charge density peak for fcc(111) and (100) agree fairly well with the analytic expression for 
continuum, and the data for the plane (110) have noticeable deviations for its quite different 
surface characteristics/roughness.  
 
3.1.3 Electric potential distributions – MD simulation and Poisson-Boltzmann solution 
In Fig. 3, the electrostatic potential ( )z  obtained from the pure MD predictions of the 
ionic concentrations are compared with ( )z  from PB equation with prescribed electrolyte 
concentration 0n , surface charge density ,e s , and modified Boltzmann distributions,

where the oscillation is absent since the effects of   in the distributions of n  and n  
cancelled each other. The reason is that, as that considered in the studies of Joly et al. [18, 19], 
we use the charged particles and fluid particles of the same size/mass. The oscillations in the 
profiles of ionic concentrations and fluid density are in phase. As a consequence, the electric 
potential profile becomes a smooth curve. The relation, Eq. (20), is not applicable for the 
low- 0n  cases, in which some of the local values of n (z) might reach the value of zero and 
render the evaluation of log function failed. 
Boundary condition (BC) of electric potential  (z) is a critical point in solution of PB 
equation. In atomistic simulation, it is not appropriate to pose the BC at the wall surface as 
that treated in continuum models. If the shear plane is used as the boundary in solution of PB 
equation, the predictions are close to the MD results with only small deviations. Solutions of 
the ion concentrations have oscillatory profile similar to the fluid density layering 
phenomenon. The location of the first peak in ionic concentration profile may change with the 
wall-fluid interaction parameters such as the lattice plane and it is about 0.2~0.5  from the 
wall. In their study of electroosmotic flows (EOF), Zhu et al. [20] claimed two possible 
choices of the BC for solution of PB equations, one is the position where the solvent 
concentration begins to rise from zero, and another one is the location of the peak in solvent 
concentration profile. 
In MD simulation with consideration of individual particle behavior, similar to the fluid 
density layering phenomenon, ionic concentration distributions are oscillatory in near-wall 
regions and the first peak of ion concentration appears at a location quite close to the solid 
surface. The net charge density profiles also have the similar feature. This atomistic feature 
cannot be found in solution of continuum models, in which both the ion concentration and 
charge density vary monotonically from the boundary to the bulk flow.

the zero-velocity region of width about 0.25~0.3 . It implies that the conventionally defined 
Stern layer does not appear in the immobile region. In the case of weak slippage, fcc (100), 
the situation of the near-wall region changes slightly but it cannot be regarded as the presence 
of Stern layer. The fluid behavior at surface fcc (110) has the smallest and negative slip length 
and is actually multilayer sticking in nature. The highest ion concentration appears in the 
immobile region. In this last situation, the structure of Stern layer is observed clearly. 
 
3.2.1 Effects of wall-fluid interactions 
The wall-fluid interaction characterized by molecular energy, wf  , may have 
significant influences on nanoscale hydrodynamics. The wall-fluid interaction energy of 
/wf  = 1 is commonly used in the previous works. In this work, the strength of the wall-fluid 
interaction is altered to reduce the van der Waals interaction potential at the interface. Figure 
9(a) presents the effects of wf   on the velocity profile of cohesive L-J fluid ( ijc = 1.2) at 
the conditions of fluid density 3f  = 0.95, wall density 3w  = 1.3, temperature Bk T  = 
1.0, electrolyte concentration 30n  =0.017, surface charge density 2 / 0.2S e    , and 
solid-wall lattice plane fcc(100). A low value of wf   implies a weak wall-fluid interaction 
and in turn an enhanced fluid slippage at the wall-fluid interface. Therefore, high flow 
velocity can be observed with the presence of large slip velocity at low values of wf  . 
Besides, comparison of the results reveals that the electrokinetic effect reduces the fluid 
velocity in this pressure-driven channel flows. It is the same as that found in the previous 
studies of electrokinetic flows and is referred to as the electrokinetic retardation. Since a large 
velocity slip will enhance the mobility of the fluid particles in EDL, and increase the 
streaming current/potential and conduction current. Therefore, the retardation can be 
enhanced with a decrease in the value of wf  .  
To examine the influence of electrokinetic retardation on the fluid flow, an index defined 
as ratio of volumetric flow rate (Q) with EDL effect to the counterpart one (Q0) without 
electrokinetic effect, Q/Q0, is employed. This parameter can be used to evaluate electrokinetic 
effect in channel flows [26] and, moreover, the flow rate reduction, 01 /Q Q , is employed to 
characterize the electrokinetic retardation in the presence of streaming potential. The 
electrokinetic retardation effects with various degrees of the wall-fluid interaction are 
presented in Fig. 9(b), where the value of 01 /Q Q  shows a descending trend with an 
increase in wf  . It means that the electrokinetic retardation is weakened with stronger 
wall-fluid interaction or smaller slippage. 
 
3.2.2 Effects of surface charge density on electrokinetic flows 
The EDL characteristics and the electric force may depend on the surface electric 
condition. In the present MD simulation, solid boundaries are subjected to prescribed surface 
charge density 2,e s /e  . Simulations with 2,e s /e  =  0.2,  0.39, and  0.58 at the 
conditions of wall density 3w  =1.3, fluid density 3f  =0.95, interaction energy 
/ 0.6wf Bk T  , electrolyte concentration 30n  = 0.08 are performed. For  ＝0.5nm, the 
corresponding values of the dimensional surface charge density are ,e s = 0.13, 0.25, 
and 0.38 2Cm . These values are quite higher than the measured values of 4 23 10 Cm    
to 4 210 10 Cm   on surface of silicon or glass. In the work of Behrens and Grier [27], it 
was indicated that, with a high pH value (e.g. pH~10) of the electrolyte, surface charge 
 14
linear correlation, Eq. (24), has larger deviation at lower B . Two sets of data, wetting and 
non-wetting, from Joly et al. [18] are also plotted. It is observed that, although the values of 
/wf   for their simulations are not available, our results have reasonable agreement with 
these previous MD data both qualitatively and quantitatively. Since slip length changes with 
the surface orientation, therefore, the lattice plane of the solid wall can significantly influence 
the value of 0  .  
In Fig. 8, with the dot line denoting the location of shear plane, we have disclosed that 
the immobile region is narrowest in the case of fcc (111), for which the slip length is the 
largest among the three lattice planes. Whereas the shear plane (the dot line) is most outward 
in the case of fcc (110). Since the local electrostatic potential drops with the distance to the 
solid wall, the shift of the shear plane outward away from the solid surface leads to a 
reduction in the local electrostatic potential at the shear plane, i.e. zeta potential.  
 
4. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
In this work, MD simulations of nanoscale pressure-driven electrokinetic flows of a 
model electrolyte have been performed at various conditions of wall and fluid properties. 
Based on the analysis presented above, the following conclusions can be drawn. 
(a) The present results disclose that the wall lattice-fluid interaction has remarkable 
influences on the nanoscale hydrodynamics. Various lattice planes may result in different 
wall-fluid interactions and fluid slippage, which in turn alter the near-wall fluid behaviors 
as well as the electrokinetics. 
(b) Comparisons of the present MD simulations and the results from the continuum model 
demonstrate that, in Poisson-Boltzmann solution of electric potential, imposing boundary 
condition at the solid surface is not appropriate. For solution of PB equation, with 
consideration of density layering phenomena in EDL region, shifting the boundary 
location to the edge of the null-ion region is more reasonable than posing the electric 
boundary condition at the wall surface. It is also found that the conventionally defined 
Stern layer may not actually exist in the flow with fluid slippage, e.g. the cases of fcc(111). 
As for the flow with multi-layer sticking (negative slip length) such as the case of fcc(110), 
a clear picture of the Stern layer structure can be observed. 
(c) In atomistic solutions, ion concentration distributions can be influenced by the fluid 
density layering phenomenon and they are also of oscillatory behaviors. As the fluid and 
charged particles are all of the same size and same mass, the oscillations will be in-phase 
and the charge density and electric potential distribution are free of oscillation. In an 
additional simulation with different size/mass of three kinds of particles, i.e., fluid 
particles (M molecule), positively charged ions ( Na ) and negatively charged ions ( Cl ), 
we demonstrated that the profiles of the fluid density and the ionic concentration have 
different phase. The resultant electric potential distribution is oscillatory in nature and it 
cannot be described by using the classical Poisson-Boltzmann equation. However, to 
highlight the electrokinetic effects in the MD simulation of nanochannel flows with 
high-velocity for suppressing thermal noise, reducing strength of wall-fluid interaction 
and extending the sampling period were employed in the present work. 
(d) Wall lattice plane and wall-fluid interaction energy both affect the electrokinetics 
remarkably; while the bulk ion concentration has relatively weaker influences in the 
parameter range considered in the present work. In addition, increase in surface charge 
density considerably enhances the electric force and in turn the electrokinetic retardation. 
Among the three lattice planes, the surface fcc(111) length leads to the largest slip and in 
turn the strongest electrokinetic retardation effect.

受邀赴北京清華大學學術參訪 ─ 出差報告 
 
2009年5月14日至6月5日，中國大陸北京清華大學熱能工程系 
宋齊有 
逢甲大學航太與系統工程系特聘教授 
 
一、前言 
本人自 2009 年 5 月 14 日至 6 月 5 日受邀赴北京清華大學熱能工
程系參訪三周。參訪期間希望瞭解該系之熱能研究進展，也期望建立
聯繫，尋求日後合作之可能。訪問期間也受邀至重慶大學與北京科技
大學訪問並各演講一場，此二校皆為名聲不錯之大陸高校，也是此次
參訪之額外斬獲。 
 
二、參訪過程 
此次參訪系受北京清華大學熱能工程系熱物理與相變化實驗室彭
曉峰教授之邀請，原邀請訪問期間為一至兩個月，但考慮時間太長，
可能耽誤研究生的論文口試，故最後決定於 5 月 14 日~6 月 5 日三週。
參訪期間包括︰(1)瞭解該系之教研狀況；(2) 熱物理與相變化實驗室之
研究方向與進展，尋找可能合作之項目；(3)受邀擔任博士生口試委員；
(4)發表學術演講。 
我 5 月 14 日搭長榮直航班機抵達北京，由於原訂住宿交通極為便
利的和家賓館 16 日才有房間，故頭兩天先住清華園服務樓 (招待所)。
待住所與研究室安頓妥當後，即展開為期三週的訪問行程，期間瞭解
該實驗室的熱流實驗設備與研究主題，參加了該實驗室的每週 meeting
討論，瞭解其研究生學習、研究、表達等各方面的情況。彭教授也邀
請我擔任兩位博士生的畢業論文口試委員，進一步瞭解其畢業學生的
研究品質。 
由於月前重慶大學熱能工程研究所所長劉朝教授已事先來函邀
請，希望我能在滯留大陸期間順道赴重大訪問。因此，我於 5 月 21 日
至 5 月 23 日赴渝訪問，參觀該校校史館，瞭解該校於對日抗戰期間與
中央大學有深厚淵源。熱能工程研究所於 5 月 22 日安排我的一場學術
演講：「具多物理耦合介面現象之微奈流」。 
除重慶大學外，因北京科技大學與清華大學有合作關係，北科大
副校長張欣欣教授也與彭教授聯繫，邀請我在北科大演講一場：「具多

稱豐碩。其學生除基礎扎實外，主動積極思考與解決問題的態度以及
努力工作的精神尤其令人激賞。 
重慶大學與北京科技大學二校皆為名聲不錯之大陸高校(在大陸千餘所
高校中名列約 30 名左右)，能建立關係也是此次參訪之額外斬獲。 
此次在受禮遇邀請之餘，能夠藉個人研究成果以及本校優異的教
研成效與名聲博得大陸高校之重視，頗覺欣慰，也希望能藉由此次參
訪拓展與大陸高校之聯繫與交流合作。

三、「第六屆海峽兩岸航空航太學術研討會」與會過程與心得 
本次研討會由西安西北工業大學主辦，台灣方面的學者專家由淡
江航太系負責邀請組織，由淡江大學前副校長馮朝剛教授擔任代表團
團長。代表團成員以淡江大學為主幹，另有國立清華大學、國立成功
大學、逢甲大學、中華大學等各校代表參加，代表團人員21員 (如附錄
一)；大陸方面有西北工業大學、西安交通大學、上海交通大學、上海
飛機設計廠、北京航空航天大學等近卅位學者專家出席。所有與會大
表於8月31日晚進駐西北工業大學校園內之正禾賓館。9月1日上午於正
禾賓館會議廳正式開幕，開啟此次會議之序幕(會議日程表如附錄二)。
會議中，來自台灣與大陸約50位教授與專家共發表了約50篇論文， 本
人發表論文題目為「微型飛行系統之技術挑戰與展望」，報告完畢後
引起聽眾極大的興趣，並有熱烈討論。此外，大陸學者的報告亦有許
多不錯的作品。 
除會議分組討論外，大會也安排了參觀西北工業大學、與西安交
通大學以及西安古城。秦嶺下西安交通大學規劃之新校區幅員遼闊，
頗見氣勢，投資甚鉅，也驚見大陸在高等教育上之不吝挹注大筆經費。 
此一學術研討會自1995年開始至今已屆13年，透過此一交流平
台，兩岸航太學者不但可以交換研究經驗與心得，更促進雙邊的友誼，
成效甚佳。 
 
四、北京清華大學參訪 
會後本人與成大航太所鄭金祥教授聯袂參訪北京清華大學熱能工
程系熱物理與相變化實驗室，由實驗室主持人彭曉峰教授及其博碩士
班學生熱誠接待。參觀了該實驗室在二相流熱傳之理論與實驗研究成
果，以及在機電裝備、元件上的應用設計，對其研發成果、清華研究
生之素質與努力的求學態度印象深刻。此次行色匆匆，彭教授邀約日
後可以安排一段時間到該實驗室一同工作。 
五、與會參訪心得 
總體而言，大陸航太工業有來自中央強力的支持，近年的「神舟」
太空計畫以及飛機設計製造的發展都使得航太工業保有一定的發展，
也帶動相關領域的研究與教育。此外，大陸近一二十年來經濟的蓬勃
