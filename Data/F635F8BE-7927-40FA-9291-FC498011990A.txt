The instability of DWCNTs that is induced by a pressure-driven steady flow is 
studied. The numerical computations indicate that as the flow velocity increases, 
DWNCTs have a way to get through multi-bifurcations of the first and second 
bifurcations in turn. It can be concluded that the critical flow velocity is closely 
correlated to the ratio of the length to the radius of DWCNTs, the pressure of the 
fluid and the small scale effects. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that as the 
small scale effects are considered, the first critical flow velocities of DWCNTs 
decrease as compared to the results with the classical (local) continuum mechanics, 
therefore, the small scale effects play an important role on performing the 
instability analysis in the fluid-conveying DWCNTs.

1. Introduction 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) discovered by Iijima (1991) have attracted 
worldwide attention due to their potential use in the fields of chemistry, physics, 
nano-engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, reinforced composite 
structures and construction engineering. CNTs can be used as strong, light and 
high toughness fibers for nanocomposite structures, parts of nano-devices and 
compared to the results with classical continuum mechanics. Zhang et al. (2004) 
investigated a nonlocal multi-shell model for the axial buckling of MWNTs under 
axial compression. Their results indicated that both the buckling mode and the 
length of tubes have contributions to the influence of the small scale on the axial 
buckling strain. Zhang et al., (2005a, 2005b) adopted the theory of nonlocal 
elasticity to investigate free transverse vibrations of double-walled carbon 
nanotubes. Wang and Hu (2005) investigated flexural wave propagation in 
single-walled carbon nanotubes, their study focuses on the wave dispersion by 
considering a model of traditional Timoshenko beam in conjunction with the 
theory of nonlocal elasticity. Wang (2005) studied wave propagation in carbon 
nanotubes by nonlocal continuum mechanics. They investigated wave propagation 
in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with both Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam 
models by considering the nonlocal elasticity.  
Recently, fluid flow inside carbon nanotubes ( CNTs)  has become an 
interesting subject. The properties of fluidity, diffusivity, and viscosity, and the 
dynamics of fluid in a fine pore have been investigated (Bitsanis, et al., 1987; 
Paul and Chandra, 2003). The dynamic properties of hydrogen bonding 
(Hummer et al., 2001), the effects of wall–fluid interaction (Sokhan et al. 2001), 
the dependence of fluid behavior on the spatial size of CNTs (Tuzun et al., 1996),

where symbols ‘:’ is the inner product with double contraction, 0C  is the elastic 
stiffness matrix of classical isotropic elasticity, σ(x)  denotes the nonlocal stress 
tensor at x, and ′ε(x )  is the strain tensor at any point x′ in the body. The kernel 
function (| |, )α τ′ −x x  is the nonlocal modulus, | |′ −x x is the Euclidean distance, 
and 0 /e a lτ =  , where 0e  is a constant appropriate to each material, a is an internal 
characteristic size (e.g. size of C–C bond, lattice spacing, granular distance) and l is 
an external characteristic size (crack size, wave length etc.). The volume integral in 
Eq. (1) is over the region V occupied by the body. The kernel function is given as

where 0K  is the modified Bessel function.  
By incorporating Eq. (1) and (2), the following equation can be derived

It is noted that the scale 0e a  in the Eq. (3) will lead to small scale effect on the 
response of structures in nano-size, furthermore, the classical (local) elasticity theory 
is recovered if the scale coefficient 0e a is set to be zero. 
3. Small scale effect on coupled shell model for DWCNT conveying fluid 
In Fig.1, DWCNTs with vdW interaction between the inner and outer walls are 
modeled by using Donnell’s cylindrical shell theory (Amabili et al., 1999). The fluid

certain value, the effective stiffness of the system diminishes, namely, the 
imaginary part goes to zero. At this moment, the instability occurs and the 
corresponding flow velocity is referred to as the critical velocity. 
 
4. Numerical computations and discussions 
The DWCNTs under consideration are simply supported at both ends, as 
shown in Fig. 1, and water that is driven by pressure goes through the inner tube at 
a steady velocity. The inner and outer tubes have the same length L. The gap 
between the two walls is 0.34 nm. The parameters that are used to calculate the 
vdW interaction coefficient are takes as ,968.2 mev=ε oAa 42.1=  and 
.407.3
o
A=σ  The other modeling parameters of the tubes are 2/360 mJEh = , the 
thickness nmh 34.0= , the mass density of the tube 3/3.2 cmgt =ρ , 
and eVD 58.0= . The mass density of the fluid is 3/0.1 cmgf =ρ . The inner 
radius and outer radius are takes as nmR 9.111 =  and nmR 24.122 = , 
respectively. 
In the numerical examples, two cases, n=2 and n=5, are considered. The 
evolution of the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues of the system (for n=2) 
as the flow velocity U are presented in Fig. 2 and 3, respectively, for the ratios 
10/ 2 =RL  and 50/ 2 =RL . The solid lines, dashed lines and dotted lines denote 
respectively. The details of the comparisons are listed in Table 1. Based on the 
numerical computations presented in Table 1 and Figs 2-5, it can be concluded that 
the critical flow velocity is closely correlated to the ratio of the length to the radius 
of DWCNTs, the pressure of the fluid and the small scale effects. Furthermore, it is 
interesting to notice that as the small scale effects are considered, the first critical 
flow velocities of DWCNTs decrease as compared to the results with the classical 
(local) continuum mechanics, therefore, the small scale effects play an important 
role on performing the instability analysis in the fluid-conveying DWCNTs. 
5. Conclusions 
Fluid-conveying double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) are modeled 
based on Donnell’s shell theory by taking into account the vdW interaction 
between the inner and outer walls, in conjunction with the consideration of the 
small scale effects by nonlocal elasticity theory. The instability that is induced by a 
pressure-driven steady flow is studied. The numerical computations indicate that 
as the flow velocity increases, DWNCTs have a way to get through 
multi-bifurcations of the first and second bifurcations in turn. It can be concluded 
that the critical flow velocity is closely correlated to the ratio of the length to the 
radius of DWCNTs, the pressure of the fluid and the small scale effects. 
Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that as the small scale effects are considered,

1. Introduction 
 
As one of the widely used structural components in aerospace, civil 
and ocean engineering systems etc., the classical bending problem of a 
thin elastic plate subjected to various boundary conditions and excitation 
loads has become one of the most popular topics. Much of the work has 
been concerned with plates of uniform thickness; however, the problem 
of the vibration of plates with varying thickness has received rather less 
attention, especially for rectangular plates with varying thickness in two 
directions. Nevertheless, non-uniform thickness plates are widely 
simulated in many kinds of high-performance technology and air vehicles 
such as electronic chips or airplane wings. When the thickness along the 
length or width (or both) of a plate is variable its closed-form solution 
becomes much more complex, even for simple cases. 
Recently there has been increasingly great interest in high strength 
materials for structural components used in mechanical, aerospace, ocean 
engineering, electronic and optical equipments. Composite materials such 
as glass-epoxy, boron-epoxy, Kevalar and graphites etc., are lighter, 
stiffer and stronger than any other material used earlier. These materials 
have a wide range of operating temperatures in accompany with the 
properties of high damping and resistance to corrosion. Plates fabricated 
out of modern composites together with thickness variation not only 
possess the advantages of being greatly reduced in both size and weight 
but also meet the desirability of high strength. Furthermore, the problem 
of plates resting on an elastic foundation has achieved importance in 
modern technological and foundation engineering. 
In this paper, the vibration problem of an orthotropic thin rectangular 
plate with non-uniform thickness variation is performed. Various cases of 
thickness variation, truncation location, aspect ratios and boundary 
conditions are investigated. The present paper also deals with the effects 
of Winkler type foundation, taping factor and truncating factor on the 
natural frequencies of orthotropic rectangular plates with varying 
thickness in one or both two directions. 
For uniform thickness plates, many solutions for elastic analysis are 
developed subjected to various boundary conditions. The classical thin 
plate theory is commonly used for the elastic vibration of an isotropic 
rectangular plate for four cases of boundary conditions, full developed 
results both analytically and numerically are discussed in Ref. [1-2]. 
For the elastic analysis of plates of variable thickness, only a limited 
number of closed-form solutions are known. A considerable amount of 
work dealing with natural frequencies of isotropic rectangular plates of 
variable thickness has appeared in the literatures [3-6], of which [4] and 
[5] are comprehensive survey papers. Reissner [7] made a remark on the

density, 1E , 2E , 21ν , 12ν  and 12G  are material constants in proper 
direction. It is assumed that the thickness ),( yxh  of the plate may be 
described by a power function as [31].

where 0h  is the thickness of the plate at the point x a=  and y b= , while 
r  and s  are referred as the taper factors of the plate in the x and y 
directions respectively, it should be noted that r  or s  could be arbitrary 
non-negative numbers in this study. It is clear that equation (2) can 
describe a variety of non-uniform rectangular plates by giving r  and s  
various values. Some common rectangular plates with variable thickness 
are listed in Table A as examples.

2.2 Construction of a Set of Tapered Beam Functions 
Consider a tapered beam with unit breadth and the continuously 
variable depth under an arbitrary load ( )q x , as shown in Figure B. The 
length of sharp ended beam is l , the origin of the co-ordinate system is at 
the sharp end of the beam and the x-axis is the centre line of the beam. 
Assume the depth of the beam can be described by a power function 
 0( ) ( / )
rh x h x l=  (3) 
where 0h  is the depth of the beam at the end x l= . The index r , 
referred to as the taper factor of the beam, is an arbitrary non-negative 
number for a sharp ended beam or is equal to zero for a uniform beam. 
It is assumed that the breadth and depth dimensions of the beam are 
small compared with its length and that the Bernoulli-Euler beam theory 
is valid. It is well-known that the static deflection ϕ  of the tapered beam 
must satisfy the fourth order linear ordinary differential equation

in which 0EI  is the flexural rigidity of the beam at the end x l= .

For a truncated beam, by substituting equation (10) into one of the 
boundary conditions, equations (13)-(15), the coefficient equations about 
( 0,1, 2,3)ijb j =  may be written in matrix form as  
 i iFB = G  (16)

According to the actual boundary conditions of the truncated beam, 
these components including ijf  and

1α  and 1β  for different values of taper parameter r . 
After all the components in F  and iG  is obtained, the solution of 
equation (16) may be written as follows 
 i -1 iB = F G , (18) 
as it can be detected that only one inverse calculation for matrix F  is 
needed because the summing variable i  is not included in matrix F . 
Computational cost will be greatly reduced.

changes in both directions to cause the complexity of the problem. Table 
4 shows the first four frequencies of a simply supported isotropic plate 
with non-linearly variable thickness in one direction only, great 
consistency between the proposed approach and previous study can be 
reached. 
In Table 5, the orthotropic plates are considered with different 
boundary conditions and various aspect ratios, and the first four 
frequencies of the plate are listed and matched with those by another 
approach (Bert and Malik, 1996, [32]). Tables 6-7 present the 
fundamental frequencies of the non-uniform plate for different boundary 
conditions and truncation factors. As it can be observed that the 
frequencies increase as the truncation factors of the plate get larger, 
which is quite reasonable. Similar results can be drawn in Table 8 except 
it deals with non-linearly variable thickness in both directions. In Table 9, 
the orthotropic plates are considered with different taper factors, different 
truncation factors and various aspect ratios; it presents the first four 
frequencies of simply supported orthotropic square plate with variable 
thickness in one direction only. Table 10 shows the fundamental 
frequencies of simply supported orthotropic square plate with variable 
thickness in one direction with several different truncation factors. 
Finally, a clamped isotropic plate resting on a Winkler type 
foundation is considered in Table 11, as it can be found that the 
frequencies get larger as the spring constants of Winkler foundation of 
the plate increase, which is fairly feasible. Table 12 presents the 
fundamental frequencies of orthotropic square plate resting on a Winkler 
type foundation, the similar results as those in Table 11 can be detected.  
 Some figures herein are depicted to present the fundamental natural 
frequencies of the rectangular non-uniform plate with respect to the 
magnitude of truncating factors. In Figure 1, three different boundary 
conditions are considered, as it can be observed from the figure, the 
fundamental frequencies of the rectangular non-uniform isotropic plate 
increase as the truncating factors get larger, which is very rational. In 
addition, the frequencies of the four-sides clamped plate are larger than 
those of the four-sides simply supported plate, while the frequencies of 
the two-sides clamped and two-sides simply supported plate are in

rectangular plates varying in one or two directions are investigated. A set 
of admissible functions which are the static solutions of the tapered beam 
under arbitrary static load is generated. By adopting the Galerkin’s 
method, the fourth order differential equation governing the motion of 
orthotropic plates can be solved by using the aforementioned functions 
for three different combinations of boundary conditions. Some numerical 
results are tabulated and compared with those available from the literature, 
and good agreement has been observed. It can be seen that this set of 
tapered beam functions can characterize the thickness variation of the 
plates. The basic concept to construct the set of admissible functions is 
theoretically stated and the eigenvalue problem of the corresponding 
ODE system is evaluated semi-analytically. This approach is suitable for 
both tapered rectangular plate and uniform rectangular plate with various 
boundary conditions and may be directly applied to the case of edge 
elastically restrained. In general, it is possible to improve the accuracy by 
increasing the number of terms for superposition of mode shapes, 
however, the first few eigen-frequencies can be obtained with good 
convergence by using a small number of terms of the static tapered beam 
function.
