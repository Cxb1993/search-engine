ABSTRACT 
 
This project mainly studies the stability and the 
stabilization for descriptor systems with 
uncertainties existing in both the derivative matrix 
and the system’s matrices. Based on matrix 
algebraic, we first derive a distinct stability 
condition, expressed in terms of strict linear matrix 
inequality (LMI), for the unforced nominal system. 
The condition is then extended to tackle the 
uncertain descriptor system, which uncertainties 
simultaneously exist in the derivative matrix and 
the system’s matrices. Furthermore, by involving a 
state feedback controller, we further discussed the 
robust stabilization for the resulting closed-loop 
systems. Significantly, all the derived criteria are 
represented in terms of LMIs, we can readily verify 
the stability or design a robust stabilizing controller 
via current LMI solvers. Given numerical examples, 
we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of 
the proposed approach.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In most physical and engineering systems, 
parameter’s uncertainties cannot be neglected 
because of the varying operation circumstance. 
Since uncertainty in the control systems are main 
sources of instability, oscillations or degraded 
performances, the stability testing and stabilization 
for uncertain traditional state-pace (or normal) 
systems have been deeply investigated in the 
considerable works, e.g., [1-3] and reference 
therein. 
The descriptor systems can describe a wider class 
of systems, including physical models and 
nondynamic constraints, and they are also known 
as singular systems, implicit systems, generalized 
state-space systems, differential-algebraic systems 
or semi-state systems [4-6]. The corresponding 
stability issue is more complicated than the normal 
systems, because it requires considering not only 
stability, but also regularity and impulse immunity 
simultaneously (see, e.g., [7-9] and references 
therein). Moreover, even if the nominal descriptor

iii) The descriptor system )()( tAxtxE =&  is said to 
be stable if it is regular, impulse free, and 
),( AEσ  lie in the open left half plane, where 
),( AEσ  denotes all roots of 0)det( =− AsE . 
III.  MAIN RESULTS 
For the unforced system in (1), i.e., 0)( ≡tu , 
we first derive the following strict LMIs condition 
for the nominal system, which is a distinct result in 
comparison with the work in [15]. 
 
Lemma 1. The nominal system )()( tAxtxE =&  is 
stable if and only if there exists a positive definite 
matrix P and a matrix Q with appropriate 
dimensions such that 
 
          0)()( <−+− ASQPESQPEA TT ,             (5) 
 
where matrix mnnRS −×∈ is of full-column rank and 
satisfies 0=SET . 
Proof. (Sufficiency) Since the inequality in (5) 
imply the nonsigularity of A , i.e., the system is 
regular and impulse free, there exists nonsingular 
matrices 1M , 
nnRN ×∈1  such that [6]

The above inequality implies 01111 <+ APPAT . 
Due to 01 >P , we thus ensure that the system is 
stable. 
(Necessity) The nominal system )()( tAxtxE =&  
is regular, impulse free and all its finite eigenvalues 
are located within the open left half plane, then 
there exists nonsingular matrices 2M , 
nnRN ×∈2  
such that

Since 1A  is stable, there exists a matrix 01 >P  
satisfying 
 
               01111 <+ APPA T .

Thus, the stability of the unforced descriptor 
system in (1) is asserted according to Corollary 1.  
The design condition with state feedback 
control law, i.e., )()( tKxtu = ,  for the uncertain 
system in (1) is presented as follows. 
Theorem 2. Assume EEi =  in (1). The resulting 
closed-loop descriptor system in (1) with with state 
feedback control )()( tKxtu =  is stable, if there 
exists matrices 0>P , Q, and X  with appropriate 
dimensions such that

where matrix mnnRS −×∈  is of full-column rank and

can be denoted as ( ) 1−−= SQPEXK T . 
Proof. It can be directly obtained from Theorem 1 
by replacing the system matrix A with 
( ) 1−−+ SQPEXBA Tlj  .                                               □

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 
approach.

descriptor system with the uncertainties (2) and (3).

matrix are respectively described as

Based on Theorem 1, we denote 
[ ]TS 100=  satisfying 0=SEi , 3~1=i , and 
construct a set of LMIs by (10) for the regarded 
system. Then, from the current LMI solver [16], we 
obtain the following feasible solutions

Thus, the considered uncertain descriptor system is 
verified to be stable according to Theorem 1.
