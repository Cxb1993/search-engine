ABSTRACT  
Purpose: To demonstrate the feasibility of applying Taguchi based Grey methods to health care in 
order to enhance the quality of medical images. 
Materials and Methods: This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimization of 
mammographic phantom image of several quality requirements using a digital X-ray device and 
Taguchi-based Grey analysis. The modified algorithm adopted herein was successfully applied to 
optimizing the X-ray settings and of grading the integrated requirements of mammographic imaging 
quality. The combinations of X-ray operating parameters in each group were determined using the 
Taguchi method, according to which the parameters could be organized into only 18 groups while yielding 
results with the same confidence as if each parameter was rectified separately. The quality requirements 
optimized herein included the high quality of a mammographic image and the tolerable radiation dose.  
Results: The optimal setting of the X-ray device for the mammographic imaging system in this work 
was Rh as the target nuclide, 31 kVp, 80 mAs and 19x23 cm2
 
FOV. The judged grade of the exposed 
mammographic image increased from 66.67 to 71.67 meeting the minimum standard (70.00) set by the 
DOH, Taiwan. The accompanying Averaged Gland Dose (AGD) to exposed phantom, 0.227 cGy, slightly 
exceeded the predicted value of 0.200 cGy.  
Conclusion: The calculation of Grey relational grade helped to quantify the overall performance of 
several quality requirements of a mammographic image. Taguchi based Grey methods are highly 
promising for use in designing imaging protocols in the future.

INTRODUCTION  
The optimization of the quality of a mammographic phantom image using a digital X-ray device and 
Taguchi-based Grey analysis is studied. Analysis results indicate that the mortality and morbidity 
associated with breast cancer in Taiwanese have steadily increased to the point that breast cancer is now 
the fourth highest cause of death due to cancer [1, 2, 3].  
Facing this critical issue, the Department Of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan (DOH, Taiwan) has 
provided free annual mammographic screening of females over the age of 40 for breast cancer. X-ray and 
ultrasonic mammography are adopted alternately for females between 40 and 50 years of age, and annual 
X-ray mammographic screening is adopted for females of over 50 years of age [4]. Hopefully, thorough 
image and accompanying Averaged Gland Dose (AGD) to exposed phantom, respectively, since the 
optimal X-ray setting should obtain both high imaging quality and low AGD in routine clinical 
examination in this study. The grade of mammographic image is given by the first definition and 
is ”the-higher-the-better”; the accompanying AGD is given by the second definition and should be 
as close to 0.2 cGy as possible, since 0.2 cGy is approximately average dose for taking one 
mammographic image in Taiwan [11].  
Grey Relational Grade  
The Grey relational grade is defined as:

The grade *0( , )i
w
i wx xγ ; Γi implies the correlation between the reference sequence and the specific 
sequence xi to be compared to. The evaluated grade fluctuates from 0.00 to 1.00 and equals one if these 
two sequences are identically coincident. Since the grade; Γi is evaluated through integrated consideration 
of two different requirements, the highest grade among all 18 groups exactly stands for the optimized 
setting for the digital X-ray device applied in this study. Furthermore, the grade also shows the 
contribution of the comparable sequence of demanded to the reference sequence. A higher grade also 
implies greater dominance of the specific sequence over the other sequences. Hence, Grey analysis 
involves a series of calculations that include measurements of differences between original data 
sequences.  
 
EXPERIMENT  
Many quality requirements must be fulfilled to ensure that the mammographic image is of high 
quality and that the dose of radiation is comparatively tolerable. Therefore, the following are considered in 
the experimental setup.  
X-ray Device  
Mammography is unique in many respects. The digital x-ray device presented in Fig. 1 is a GE 
model seno-2000D adopted in this investigation. The device’s compact geometry, comparatively low 
power output and dual bombarded target nuclei (Mo/Rh) easily satisfy the requirements of mammographic 
Table 4 presents the Grey relational grade after it was converted by applying Eqs. 4 to 9. Group 6 in 
Table 4 had the highest grade, 0.985. Groups 8 and 17 had the second and third highest grades, 0.975 and 
0.952, respectively. Additionally, the average breast imaging grade was 66.67 for both groups 8 and 9, and 
the accompanying AGDs were 0.209 cGy and 0.293 cGy, respectively [cf. Tab. 3]. The calculated Grey 
grades for groups 8 and 9 were very different 0.975 (rank 2) and 0.829 (rank 9), respectively. The 
operating parameters of the X-ray mammographic imaging in group 6 were (1) target nuclide: Mo, (2) 
kVp: 28, (3) mAs: 80 and (4) FOV: 19x23 cm2. The X-ray setting in group 6 yielded both the highest 
average grade and the accompanying AGD to exposed phantom smaller than 0.20 cGy, although no 
member of the group satisfied the fundamental requirement described herein. Clearly, a single quality 
requirement can be more easily met in X-ray mammography than can several.  
 
VERIFICATION AND DISCUSSION  
Incorporating Taguchi’s Analysis into Optimization 
Taguchi analysis can rapidly and reliably yield the settings for X-ray mammography. The quality of 
image is numerically verified, and the method is found to compromise the conflict among various 
requirements, while maintaining the high quality of the image demanded by the users. Moreover, the 
calculated Grey relational grade was critical only in quantifying the quality requirements. It was also the 
target value in Taguchi analysis, since this analysis cannot optimize several criteria, as in maximizing 
imaging grade and minimizing AGD of exposed phantom [cf. Tab. 4]. Taguchi’s analysis was conducted 
to widen the range of applications of Grey relational analysis and maximize the Grey relational grade [cf. 
Tab. 1] [21, 22, 23, 24]. The Grey relational grade of each assigned group was used as the target value in 
Taguchi’s method. The grades were recalculated as follows [25]:

⎡ ⎤= − ⎢ ⎥⎣ ⎦∑                    （11） 
where η was the inspection index, and defined as the signal to noise ratio (S/N unit: dB). A larger η 
was considered preferable, since the Grey relational grade of mammographic image was expected to be of 
the form ”the-higher-the-better”. A higher η (S/N) value also revealed superior integrated performance for 
mammographic imaging because the main signal dominated the noise. yi was the Grey relational grade in 
each group, i and n were the number of repeated trials in each group. The number of repeated trials was 
one, because only a single relational grade was acquired in each group to calculate this particular S/N.  
Table 5 lists the η (S/N) and the corresponding Grey relational grade for each group. As clearly stated, 
the highest grade for group 6; 0.985 was converted to the highest η value 0.130. The η value for each 
group was further rearranged and averaged based on various factors [cf. Tab 2]. For instance, averages 
from group 1 to 8 and from group 9 to 18 represented the contributions from target nuclide Mo and Rh. 
Averages for groups 1, 2, 3, 10, 11 and 12; groups 4, 5, 6, 13, 14 and 15 and groups 7, 8, 9, 16, 17 and 18 
indicated the contributions of various levels of factor B (kVp). Additionally, kVp was assigned as 25 (B1), 
28 (B2) and 31 (B3), respectively in this work [cf. Tab 1]. Figure 3 plots the rearranged averages η against 
the operating parameters of the x-ray device.  
Figure 3 presents the optimal value of each operating parameter (A) target nuclide: Rh, (B) kVp: 31, 
(C) mAs: 80 and (D) FOV: 19x23 cm2, Figure 3 also displays the dominant factors for mammography in 
this work. As clearly shown, either higher mAs or higher kVp can obtain superior quality in real, 
since ”the-higher-the-better” η was exactly the value required, according to Taguchi’s calculation [cf. Eq. 
11]. The similar finding was also verified by Dr. Huda [26]. He used the same mammographic phantom to 
assess the image quality and claimed that increasing either kVp or mAs of X-ray device can effectively 
upgrade the visibility of artificial lesion inside the phantom. However, the image quality was judged 
too thin to represent the majority of mamma of Taiwanese [cf. Fig 6].  
The indigenous PMMA mammographic phantom is made using homogenous Lucite material of 
different thicknesses (20 mm and 35 mm). The PMMA density is 1.19 g/cm3. A standardized 
mammographic phantom with suitable thickness can represent the mamma tissue of most Taiwanese and 
yield more available information for routine quality assurance process. Therefore, changing the thickness 
of the original wax in the ACR-156 phantom from 42 mm to 35-38 mm may enable the phantom to 
represent real Taiwanese mamma tissue.  
CONCLUSION  
The calculation of the Grey relational grade helped to quantify the integrated performance of several 
quality requirements of mammographic image. The complex interactions in optimizing mammographic 
image involved the target nuclide, kVp, mAs and FOV. The optimization of a digital image by 
determining its Grey relational grade and using the recommendation of Taguchi for determining X-ray 
operating parameters was successful. Therefore, the optimal setting of the digital X-ray device for 
mammography were Rh as the target nuclide, 31 kVp, 80 mAs and 19x23 cm2
 
of FOV. In conclusion, the 
grade of the mammographic image increased from 66.67 to 71.67 meeting the minimum standard of DOH, 
Taiwan. The accompanying AGD to exposed phantom, 0.227 cGy, slightly exceeded the predicted value 
of 0.200 cGy.
