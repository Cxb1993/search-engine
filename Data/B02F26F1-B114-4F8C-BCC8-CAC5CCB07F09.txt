process with chromium and Al88Si12 alloy dual rotating cathodes was used for the deposition of CrAlSiN 
coatings. The wear resistance of this coating was evaluated by ball-on-disc test after post heat treatment in 
different atmosphere at 400oC for 3 hours. 
2. Experimental  
 CrAlSiN coatings were deposited on polished tool steel substrates by using a cathodic-arc deposition 
system with lateral rotating arc cathodes (Platit π80, madeby Switzerland). Chromium and AlSi (88 at.% of Al 
and 12 at.% of Si) alloy targets were equipped on the chamber to deposit the CrAlSiN coatings. The samples 
were mounted on the rotational substrate holder at a rotational speed of 3 rpm for the deposition of the CrAlSiN 
coatings. The temperature of the sample during the deposition was measured by a thermocouple located near the 
sample and controlled at 400 ~ 430 ◦C. Substrate bias voltage was set at −80V. CrAlSiN coated samples were 
oxidized in air using a conventional furnace at 800 ◦C for 2 h. The heating rate was 3 ◦C/min. Post heat 
treatment of the CrAlSiN coatings were carried out in air and nitrogen, respectively, at 400 ◦C for 3 h. The 
chemical binding of the deposited coatings were identified by using an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). 
The microstructure of the CrAlSiN films was investigated by using an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X’pert 
Pro), a JEOL JSM-7000F high resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Tribological 
tests of coatings were performed on a ball-on-disc tribometer (CSEM). The tests were conducted with no 
lubricant along a circular track of 20 mm diameter against a 6.35 mm diameter WC-Co ball at 0.3 m/s under a 
normal load of 10 N in ambient atmosphere. The wear tracks of the coatings were scanned by a profile meter. 
The dc potentiodynamic tests were conducted in 1M H2SO4 solution through a three-electrode cell connected to 
a Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Model 263A) system.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
 From the chemical composition measurement by XPS, the atomic ratio Cr-Al-Si-N coating was obtained as 
0.23 – 0.32 – 0.04 – 0.41 by using Cr and Al88Si12 dual alloy targets in this study. The stoichiometric 
Cr0.38Al0.56Si0.06N of the as-deposited coating is obtained. The overall thickness of the coating ranging is around 
1.3 µm. Hardness and elastic modulus of the as-deposited Cr0.38Al0.56Si0.06N coating measured by nano-indenter 
are 41 ± 2 GPa and 350 ± 10 GPa, respectively. Previous study [12], used H3/E*2 ratio as an index for the 
resistance of plastic deformation, concluded that Cr0.38Al0.56Si0.06N coating exhibits higher resistance to plastic 
deformation than CrN due to the introduction of Al and Si into the CrN. The (Al+Si)/Cr ratio was 1.57 which 
tends to form equiaxed and nano-scale grains based on the study of Karimi et al [4]. High-temperature oxidation 
of the deposited Cr0.38Al0.56Si0.06N coatings has been studied at 800 ◦C. XRD analysis shows no obvious oxide 
peak found in the glancing angle spectrum after oxidation at 800◦C for 2 h. It showed the improved oxidation 
resistance of the deposited Cr0.38Al0.56Si0.06N. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the XPS spectra of Cr 2p, Al 2p, Si 2p and N 1s binding energy of the CrAlSiN coatings 
after argon-ion etching. The Cr 2p3/2, Al 2p, and Si 2p peaks of the as-deposited Cr-Al-Si-N coating were 
located at 574.7, 74.0, and 101.5 eV, respectively. Fig. 1(a) shows two peaks of Cr 2p from the as-deposited 
coating. The first peak of Cr 2p 3/2 is centered at the binding energy value of 574.7 eV is in the range of 
574.1–574.8 eV, which is reported for metallic chromium. The standard binding energy of Cr 2p 3/2 from CrN 
and Cr2O3 is 575.7 ~ 576.2 eV and 576.5 ~ 579.5 eV, respectively, owing to the result of the change of the 
electron binding state during reaction between N, O and Cr [13]. Due to separation of the Cr and CrN within 1

 Fig. 3 shows the SEM images of the surface morphologies of the Cr-Al-Si-N coating with post treatment. 
Compared to the as-deposited coating (Fig. 3(a)), no matter heat treatment in air and nitrogen, similar structure 
of the coatings was seen, showing the spreading droplets on the surface due to the liquid particles emitted from 
the hot cathodic spot. The fine grain structure of around 1 µm was also seen from the surface image composed of 
the crystallize nitrides embedded in the Si3N4 matrix [12].

 A pin-on-disk tribometer was used to evaluate the friction coefficient of the CrAlSiN coatings against a 
WC-Co ball. Fig. 4 shows the coefficient of friction versus travel distance under a load of 10 N. The coefficient 
of friction of the as-deposited CrAlSiN coating was gradually increased in the range of 0.6 ~ 0.7 until the end of 
the travel distance. The observed higher friction coefficient of CrAlSiN after heat treatment in air was compared 
to that of the as-deposited coating. For the CrAlSiN coating with post treatment in nitrogen at 400 oC, the 
coefficient of friction is clearly decreasing to the value of 0.3 – 0.4. Fig. 5 shows the wear volumes of the various 
coatings after wear test for 3000 m without lubricant. The least volume loss of the Cr-Al-Si-N coating after post 
treatment in nitrogen is seen. For the coating with heat treatment in air, the largest volume loss of the coating is 
observed due to the highest coefficient of friction against WC-Co ball. From the previous XPS and XRD analysis, 
it is considered that stress relaxation and transformation of amorphous structure of the coating are happened at 
the temperature of 400oC, which leads to the degradation in air and crystallization in nitrogen, respectively. N2 
gas, expected to play a protecting role, is to enhance the formation of Si3N4 matrix of the Cr-Al-Si-N coating, 
resulting in the lower coefficient of friction and higher wear resistance.
