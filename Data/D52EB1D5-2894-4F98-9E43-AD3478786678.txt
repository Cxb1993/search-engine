2.1. Modify surface free energy for molecular stacking  
O2 plasma buffing  O2 plasma bombardment is a well known method that can effectively 
increase surface energy. As shown in Fig. 1, the surface free energy of the substrate increases with 
the time a substrate exposed to the plasma. Detail discussion can be found in paper p.1 and p.3.

Changes in surface free energy due to temperature The energetic state of the substrate is 
strongly correlated with the thermal state of the substrate. The temperature dependence of surface 
free energy of the ITO glass substrates used in the present studies is shown in Fig. 2. An increase 
in the temperature results in a decrease in the surface free energy of the substrate.  
 Based on the knowledge of the surface characteristics of the substrate and the techniques to 
obtain a desirable surface energy template, we went on to study the stacking of discotic molecules 
on surfaces with various surface free energies, and drawn some useful conclusions as follows. At 
an elevated temperature, the surface free energy of the ITO glass is sufficiently low to support an 
edge-on anchoring of the discotic molecules, in which the discotic molecules stand up 
perpendicular to the surface, and as a result, the homogeneous alignment of the columnar phase is 
promoted. A decrease in the temperature of the substrate results in an increase in the surface free 
energy of the substrate, and the surface can no longer support the good edge-on anchoring of the 
discotic molecules because of a weakened repulsion of the surface as it became more hydrophilic 
with a higher surface free energy. Therefore, the discotic molecules at the surface deviate from the  
 2
goal.

3.1. Etch grooves into surface for the alignment of discotic columnar phase 
Conventional photo-lithography technique is used to etch the substrate surface. The process is 
shown in Fig. 5. A layer of photoresist was spin-coated onto a clean ITO glass substrate. The 
thickness of the coating, determined by controlling the spin speed of the coater, is about 5 μm. The 
photoresist film was exposed to UV irradiation through a mask for 1 minute. The irradiated sample 
was soaked in developer and then washed to produce the micro-grooves on the surface. The width 
and the period of the grooves and the pattern of the grooves were easily determined by a proper 
designed mask. In the present studies, grooves with 5 μm, 10 μm and 20 μm width and 
equidistance, respectively, were etched into the substrates.

The grooves were filled with a DLC by spin-coating an in house synthesized discogen 
11,12-bisdodecyloxy-2,3,6,7-tetrakisoctyloxydibenzo[a,c]phenazine (HDBP-4C8-2C12) in a 10 
wt% solution in anhydrous toluene. After coating, the solvent was allowed to evaporate in a 
Class-IV clean area at room temperature for a few hours.

3.2. Multi-domain alignment of discotic columns on SAM 
We modified the substrate into a multi-domain energetic template using self-assembly 
monolayer (SAM). In this technique, we coated substrates using two silane compounds 
octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), with a surface free energy of 20.8 mJ/m2, and 
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), with a surface free energy of 58.37 mJ/m2, to form regions 
with different surface free energies, and let a discotic liquid crystal 
11,12-bisdodecyloxy-2,3,6,7-tetrakisoctyloxydibenzo[a,c]phenazine (HDBP) stack in a cell made 
using the treated substrates. The monomolecular films can be grafted onto substrates by means of 
stamp-print technique (Fig. 9). For this purpose, a slab of patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
was immersed into the silane solution for 30 seconds, and taken out and dried using a stream of 
nitrogen. The silane was then printed onto a peroxidized substrate by stamping the PDMS coated 
with the silane onto the substrate immediately after the silane solution being dried. To allow the 
silanization process to be completed, the PDMS stamp was kept on the substrate for 2 min by 
gently pressuring the stamp. The silanization processes for OTS SAM was taking 2 hours. After 
silanization, the substrates were washed by taking 5 min ultrasonic bath in anhydrous toluene, 
anhydrous ethyl, and deionized water subsequently in order to remove surplus silane resided at the 
surface, and then dried in a 120 °C oven for 5 min. In the stamp-print technique, the size and the

Fig. 11. On the APS surface the discotic columns are aligned vertically to the surface and exhibit

(c) 90°, respectively, in the polarising microscope. 
 
4. Summary and suggestions 
 In this project, we have studied the surface characteristics of substrates and their influences 
on the molecular stack of discotic molecules. We concentrated particular on the effects of surface 
free energy of the substrate on the stack of disc-like molecules and the orientation of the discotic 
columns. Based on the knowledge gained, we try to align discotic columns locally to form 
molecular tunnels in a columnar phase. Major achievements and progress can be summarized as 
follows. 
i) Surface energetic state of substrate can determine the orientation of the discotic 
columns  
On a solid with high surface free energy the discotic molecules tend to stack to form 
homeotropic aligned columns with the face-on molecular anchoring at the surface, 
whereas a surface with low free energy favours the edge-on molecular anchoring and 
induces homogeneous alignment of the discotic columns. For a columnar phase with 
face-on anchoring at the surface, a decrease in the surface free energy causes the discotic 
columns to tilt away from the normal to the substrate.  
ii) The anisotropic energetic character can be important factor which influences the 
way the molecules assembly 
A mechanical rubbing breaks the two-dimensional topographical uniformity of the 
polymer surface and causes changes in the surface free energy of the polymer thin films.

2. We propose a new concept of “in-line anisotropy” for analysing surface energetic state of 
molecular alignment layers. This might become a useful parameter for the attainment of a 
uniform molecular packing towards defect free smectic liquid crystal layers.  
3. We observed the surface free energy of the substrate on the columnar phase alignment, 
and revealed the relation between the energetic character and the tilt of the discotic 
columns. This allows us to move one step forward to the control of alignment of discotic 
materials in the columnar phase.  
4. We are able to align discotic columns locally to match the requirement for 
one-dimensional charge transport.
