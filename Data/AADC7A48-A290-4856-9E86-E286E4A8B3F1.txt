英文摘要。
A lot of research has a good opinion of managing forward-oriented supply chains while more and
more research provides insights into handling single-stage inventory systems with reverse flows.
To use again of any recovery resource not only can reduce the treatment expenses of the old and
useless material but also can reduce the cost of the original supplies. Many companies voluntarily
collect used products to recover residual value, and may even design their products to maximize
their value because of environmental regulations and decreasing costs. Product remanufacturing
like transforming used items into usable products through refurbishment, repair, upgrading, etc.
plays an important role in the production and distribution system. Once companies have used
products, they need to find the most economically and environmentally beneficial way to deal
with them, and remanufacturing is often part of the solution. This study analyzes a supply
inventory system with inventory stages arranged in cycles. In addition to traditional forward
material flows, used products are returned to a recovery facility where they can be stored,
remanufactured and shipped to distributor for sale. This study investigates an optimal policy for a
multi-echelon inventory system with remanufacturing, deteriorating and price dependent demand.
Combine the partsof used product stock, usable product inventory, distributor’s inventory and 
recycle company inventory in this system. To deal with the optimal policy by considering the
integration of the manufacturer, distributor and recycler, the study develops a mathematical
model for deteriorating items and price dependent demand. It is distinctive and adaptive to derive
the optimum solution through the genetic algorithms. The integrated approach results in an
impressive cost-reduction for the whole system through sensitivity analysis. An example of a
multi-echelon inventory system is used to demonstrate the system. The solutions obtained by the
genetic algorithm are compared with an independent decision by the economic order quantity.
We can show that the integrated approach results in an impressive cost-reduction for the whole
system.

二、 研究目的
本研究的目的為整合供應鏈正向物流與逆向物流為循環供應鏈，並考慮貨品之損耗性
與價格敏感性需求之存貨政策，以達整合存貨管理之最佳化；進而探討各成員間，應如何
分配整合利益。研究探討多階層回收再製造生產存貨模式，也就是製造商(Manufacturer)同
時考慮正規生產與回收再製造生產商品，然後透過經銷商(Distributor)與零售商(Retailer)銷
售給消費者；再經逆向管道回收消費者使用過後之廢舊產品給製造商進行再製造。其結構
組成包含製造商、經銷商、回收商，如圖2.1 所示。系統中有廢舊品存貨、可供銷售產品存
貨、經銷商存貨、回收商存貨。系統目標為整合總相關存貨成本最低，有關決策變數為再製造生
產批量、新品生產批量、產品配送頻率、回收收貨頻率與銷售價格。
三、 文獻探討
1多階存貨模式
供應鏈管理中多階存貨的概念，始於1960年由Clark和Scarf 提出，定義了多階存貨
(echelon inventory)為整合供應鏈上下階層存在尚未被運送與銷售之存貨總和。接著1974年
Geoffrion和Graves利用混合整數規劃法，建構一個多產品的配銷模式，模式中由工廠、倉
儲中心與客戶所組成；1984年再由Federgruen和Zipkin發展出具有多零售商型的數學模式。
後續研究者多以線性、非線性規劃法、隨機模式以及數學模式[23]構建多階存貨模式，多階
層存貨整合模式得到整體最佳化時，對個別顧客未必最有利，製造商於是提供數量折扣，
藉此提高顧客訂購量以達到最佳組合。但就整體的考量，應以銷售者與購買者共同利益最
大化為整合模式的目標，然後將所節省的成本公平的分享給各方，這也是供應鏈成功的重
要因素。供應鏈階層大小因企業經營、產品、市場不同而有不同的型式，一般有二階或三
階。有研究探討二階層存貨模式與三階層存貨模式，也就是製造商(Vendor)、經銷商
(Distributor)、零售商(Retailer)。

再利用性存貨泛指將舊產品由顧客端回收，透過直接再利用、修護、再生與再製造等
再利用方式用來滿足顧客需求、並支援生產與其相關活動所需的物品。其分類方式依照
Thierry(1995)的分類定義，如1表所示：
表1 再利用性之分類
再利用的種類 定義
直接再利用(direct reuse) 不經過修護的作業程序， 亦即僅少部
分的保養與清洗等動作。
修護(repair) 小幅度恢復物品的原有功能， 而不改
變物品的原有結構。
再生(recycling) 回復成物料的型態而不保持物品的原
有結構。
再製造(remanufacturing) 將物品重新再製造且與新物品狀態功
能一樣。
為了解決再利用性存貨問題，1967年由Schrady以F.W. Harris在1915年所發展出的傳統
經濟訂購量為基礎，推導出再利用性產品的經濟訂購量(Economic Order Quantity)模式而
Richter(1996)探討顧客需求是由本身產生的產品與廢棄物的修復共同來滿足的EOQ模式，在
此模式中固定了回收週期，以最小成本為目標尋求出最佳的修復次數與生產次數。其後
Richter(1996)又擴充之前的模式，將固定週期擴充為變動的回收週期。Kleber和Minner(2002)
應用 Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle去探討多物品之回收存貨系統之最佳生產與再製策
略。Koh等(2002)則探討ㄧ個EOQ與EPQ聯合模式，研究可回收產品與外購新產品之間的最
佳訂購數量、訂購次數與回收品修復次數。Kiesmuller(2003)研究單一物品的回收存貨系統，
可提供顧客需求的產品來自兩部分：一是回收再製部分，另ㄧ部分是自行生產。Dobos (2003)
用HMMS型的逆物流系統提出生產存貨策略。Richter 與Gobsch(2003)將JIT觀念運用在回收
性物料與新物料的生產環境，並運用動態規劃求解此模式。Marisa P. de Brito和Rommert
Dekker(2003)探討了在回收中常見的假設並提供了明確的資訊來管理逆物流的存貨系統。在
Ruud Teunter(2004)中是假定製造商具有製造新品及修復回收品的能力，探討生產率在有限
(無限)和回復率無限(有限)的情況下，最佳的經濟生產批量。Ryszarda Rempala(2005)探討了
在連續生產、需求為間斷的Possion分配且具有庫存上下限條件下單一產品存貨模式。
四、 研究方法
本研究所採用研究方法為系統模式構建與演進法，首先將多階供應鏈存貨之運作方式
架構一個概念性模式(conceptual model)，藉以分析與說明供應鏈存貨系統各成員之關係與
定義；再由概念性模式發展出數學模式(mathematical model)，用以表達系統之總成本結構
與相關問題之限制條件；最後透過電腦軟體以基因演算法推導出系統模式之最佳化解答。

The optimization problem is to determine the value of k, l, n, m and Tr that maximizes
JP(k,l,n,m,Tr). Two cases are discussed. The first case does not consider the integration
(sequential decision making by retailer and manufacturer). The second case considers the
integration of the system (centralized decision-making). Since the problem is a constrained
nonlinear mixed programming problem, one can derive the value of k, l, n, m and Tr by the
following procedure:

發表論文摘要
ABSTRACT
Many companies show an interest to collect used products to recover residual value because of
environmental regulations and consumer pressures. Reverse logistics can lead to better
relationships among supply chain partners, more profits through reduced costs, and greater
efficiencies and higher remanufacturing rates for used products. Price discount is a significant
approach for developing a closed-loop supply chain coordination policy. The joint decision
policy characterized by selling prices, production quantity and replenishment schedules is
coordinated through price discount. This study analyzes a closed-loop supply chain inventory
system with inventory stages in recycles. In addition to traditional forward material flows, the
used products are returned to a recovery facility where they can be stored, remanufactured and
shipped to retailers for sale. This study investigates a price discount policy for a multi-echelon
inventory system with remanufacturing and price sensitive demand for deteriorating items. We
derive the optimal price discount policy by considering the integration of the manufacturer and
the retailer, and develop a mathematical closed-loop supply chain inventory model with
remanufacturing and price dependent demand for deteriorating items. An example of a
closed-loop multi-echelon inventory model is used to illustrate the system with different
negotiation factors and profit-sharing ratios. Thus, obtaining the greatest benefits for the whole
system should be in a cooperative environment. Price discount policy must be incorporated into
the supply chain inventory management system

1. Introduction
In order to reduce cost and conform to environmental
regulations, many companies not only collect used products
and but also design their products to allow for reuse and
remanufacture. Product remanufacturing such as
transforming used items into usable products through
refurbishment, repair and upgrading plays an important role
in the production, distribution and retailing system. One of
the principal objectives of a supply chain management is to
develop a positive design mechanism to coordinate the
manufacturer and the retailer. The cooperative decision
policy characterized by the selling price, the ordering cycle
time and the replenishment schedule is coordinated through
price discounting. Many researchers have found ways of
managing forward-oriented supply chains and had
fascinating insights in handling single-stage inventory
systems.
Schrady [1], the earliest author, proposed a deterministic
model with infinite production rates with manufacturing
and remanufacturing. The optimal ordering lot sizes for the
manufacturing and remanufacturing were similar to the
classical EOQ formula. Several authors extended the model
of Schrady. Nahmias and Rivera [2] generalized this model
for finite remanufacturing rates; Mabini et al. [3] considered
a stock out service level constraints and the multi-product
model. With a different control policy, Richter [4]
suggested a model which was similar to Schrady’s model.
Koh, et al. [5] analyzed situations where
manufacturing/remanufacturing rates were finite. Several
other studies separately addressed collection issues.
Savaskan et al. [6] determined the optimal collection
channel configuration of a monopolist manufacturer.
Bautista and Pereira [7] emphasized locating these
collection area problems, and established the relationship
between the set covering problem and the MAX-SAT
problem.
Because the delivery number and lot size would influence
an overall integrated cost, Monahan [8] investigated the
integration approach by minimizing total costs for the
vendor and discounting the price offered by the buyer to
reach a compromise between the two parties. Lu [9]
developed a one-vendor multi-buyer integrated model to
minimize vendor price and maximum the acceptable cost to
the buyer. Goyal [10] designed a policy in which buyer
delivery lot size comprised the entire inventory available to
the vendor. Hill [11] offered a more general type of policy
for a single-vendor, single buyer production-inventory
model based on successive shipments to the buyer within a
single production batch size increasing by a fixed factor.
Yang and Wee [12] developed an arborescent model that
considered the integration of the producer, distributor and
retailer. Chung and Wee [13] proposed an optimal
replenishment and pricing policy by maximizing the
supplier, manufacturer and retailer’s shared profit in a 
price-sensitive demand.
Deterioration is a significant consideration in the inventory
model. Ghare and Schrader [14] were the first authors to
study inventory deterioration with constant demand. Other
authors, Wee [15], Yang and Wee [16] and Wee, Yang and
Shih [17], established their models based on multifarious
assumptions. Yang and Wee [18] and Yang [19] derived a
model for integrating the vendor and the buyer to optimize
the delivery number and lot size for deteriorating items,
This study analyses a closed-loop supply chain inventory
system with remanufacturing for deteriorating items. In
addition to the traditional forward material flows, the used
products are returned to recovery facilities where they will
be remanufactured and shipped to retailers for sale. The
situation is illustrated in Figure 1. The objective of this
study is to derive an optimal replenishment and pricing
policy by maximizing the retailer and manufacturer’s joint 
profit in a win-win cooperation. We derive the optimal
policy by considering the integration of the manufacturer
and the retailer, and develop a mathematical model that
simultaneously determines the discount price, the number
of deliveries and the replenishment interval with
exponentially decreasing price dependent demand. An
example of a closed-loop multi-echelon inventory model is

factors and profit-sharing ratios. That is the extra profit
accrued mainly to the down-stream site should be shared.
One can show that the integrated approach results in an
impressive extra profit for the whole system.

When there is no pricing discount and decentralized
decision-making with sequencing optimization from retailer

can be found by taking the derivative of (25) with respect to

4. Solution Procedure
The optimization problem is to determine the value of pr, pc,
n, m and Tr that maximizes JP(pr,pc,n,m,Tr). Since the
problem is a constrained nonlinear mixed programming
problem, one can derive the value of pr, pc, n, m, and Tr by
the following procedure:
(a) When there is before pricing discount (pr = Pr, pc=Pc
and cbPaeD  ), (27) and the values of I# satisfy (30).
The retailer’s optimal ordering cycle time Tr#, the
optimal value n# and m# before pricing discount can be
derived.
(b) The number of I will be in the vicinity of the number of
I# derived a set of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions

increases, the optimal retailer’s seling price and the 
percentage of the extra joint profit (PEJP) also increase, but
the optimal retailer’s purchase unit price and the optimal
joint profit are decreases.

The results of variousαvalue solutions are given in Table 4.
As shown in Table 4, whenα= 0.001, the retailer and
manufacturer’s joint profit is maximized. However, the
extra profit is accrued mainly to the retailer. The optimal
retailer’s seling price is $62.42, the optimal retailer’s 
purchase unit price is $37.57 and the optimal retailer’s

6. Conclusion
This study considers an optimal replenishment and pricing
policy for a closed-loop supply chain inventory system. An
inventory supply chain model coordinated through price
discounting is developed when the demand is exponentially
decreasing. The right price discount and the best ordering
policy are achieved through maximizing the joint profit of
the two-echelon inventory system under different
profit-sharing ratios. Using KKT optimality conditions and
mathematical software, we derive the optimal policy of the
system for all-unit discounts with one price break. The
numerical example illustrates the coordination through
pricing discount, and thus making a significant profit
increase. The percentage extra joint profit (PEJP) is
12.34%. When the deterioration rate (θ) increases, the
percentages of the extra joint profit (PEJP) also increase,
but the optimal joint profit decreases. When the negotiation
factor αdecreases, the optimal joint profit and the retailer’s 
extra profit will increase, but the extra profit of the
manufacturer will decrease. That is the extra profit is
accrued mainly to the retailer. Therefore, to obtain the
greatest benefits for all of the players, cooperative strategies
with profit sharing must be implemented. Optimal
replenishment and price discount policy are the strategies
that can be incorporated into the supply chain management
system.
