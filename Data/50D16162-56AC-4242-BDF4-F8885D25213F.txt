Abstract ‚Äî Full-vectorial finite element beam propagation method is developed for analyzing
anisotropic waveguides with non-diagonal permittivity and permeability tensors. For the cases in which
the tensors are in diagonal form, the imaginary-distance beam propagation method can be employed to
speed up the analysis process.
Keywords ‚Äî Beam propagation method, imaginary-distance beam propagation method, anisotropic
waveguides, optical waveguides.
INTRODUCTION
Anisotropic dielectric waveguides possess several interesting propagation properties and are of great
practical interest. For example, strong selectivity to linearly polarized light makes anisotropic waveguides
useful as components in coherent optical communication systems, birefringent directional couplers, and
fiber sensors. Yet, analysis of anisotropic waveguides with arbitrary permittivity and permeability tensors
encounters substantial mathematical difficulties because of the complicated equations involved. In this
work, we use the finite element beam propagation method (FE-BPM) [1] to avoid the complicated
mathematical problem. A complete derivation of the FE-BPM is shown and the proton-exchanged
LiNbO3 (PE-LN) optical waveguide with non-diagonal material tensors is analyzed to show the validity
of this method. For the cases with diagonal tensors, the whole formulation can be simplified and the
concept of imaginary-distance beam propagation method (ID-BPM) [2] can be utilized to speed up the
analysis process. We analyze another anisotropic embedded-channel LiNbO3 to validate the FE-ID-BPM.
FORMULATIONS
We consider an optical waveguide surrounded by an anisotropic perfectly matched layer (PML) [3].
The relative permittivity and permeability tensors for a general case are given respectively as

NUMERICAL RESULTS
We consider a 3-D anisotropic optical waveguide surrounded by PMLs as shown in Fig. 1(a),
where the substrate is LiNbO3 (LN) and the guiding region is proton-exchanged LiNbO3 (PE-LN). The
waveguide parameters are t = w = 3 ¬µm, Wx = 9 ¬µm, Wy = 7 ¬µm, and d = 2 ¬µm. The substrate has
ordinary and extraordinary indexes of n0 = 2.250 and ne = 2.172, and the refractive index difference
between the guiding region and the substrate is ‚àÜne = 0.01 for the extraordinary index and for the
ordinary index, ‚àÜn0 is assumed to be zero. The relative permittivity tensor for LN is

where Œ∏c is the angle between the crystalline c-axis and the y-axis on the yz-plane. Fig. 1(b) shows the
converged reference index as a function of the crystal angle Œ∏c and excellent agreement with the results
of [1] has been achieved. We then apply the FE-ID-BPM to calculate the eigenmode of an embedded-
channel LiNbO3 integrated optical waveguide [4]. The structure and material parameters are given in
the Fig. 1(c), and Fig. 1(d) presents the dispersion characteristics of the E11y mode together with those
calculated by [4] and again very good agreement is seen.

CONCLUSION
We have developed a full-vectorial FE-BPM providing an approach without the need of extra co-
ordinate transformations as pre-process to get diagonal tensors and as post-process to get real field
distributions in analyzing anisotropic waveguides with non-diagonal permittivity and permeability ten-
sors. When the tensors are in diagonal form, the FE-ID-BPM can be used to obtain the results more
efficiently. The accuracy of this work is validated by the cases of proton-exchanged and anisotropic
embedded-channel LiNbO3 integrated optical waveguides.

Fig. 4. Ratio of the fundamental mode power confined
within the core region for different cladding radii.
¬µm and infinite R are shown in Fig. 3. The
corresponding effective refractive indices are
1.41427 and 1.41422, respectively. By infinite
cladding we mean there is no outer cladding-air
boundary in the structure and thus within the
computational domain. It is interesting to observe in
Fig. 2 that the cladding-air boundary plays an
important role in the core mode formation for
smaller R. The three profiles in Fig. 2 are
significantly different among one another. For R =
7.5 ¬µm, a dip occurs in the air hole and the side
peak appears between the air hole and the cladding
boundary. When R is increased to 20 ¬µm, it is seen
that the oscillatory behavior has already been quite
similar to that in the R = 62.5 ¬µm case in Fig. 3. Of
course, in the R = 20 ¬µm case, the oscillation stops
at x = 20 ¬µm, beyond which the field decays
evanescently and in the R = 62.5 ¬µm case, the
oscillation extends until x = 62.5 ¬µm.  Comparing
the two profiles in Fig. 3, we see that although their
behaviors are quite similar near the core region, the
tail field of the ideal infinite-cladding structure
oscillates with decaying amplitude, while that of the
R = 62.5 ¬µm structure shows a little larger
amplitude but without obvious decay. Therefore,
more power propagates in the cladding for the
finite-cladding structures. We estimate the
percentage of power confined within the core region
by finding the ratio of the power flow within the
quarter-circle region with radius of 2.5 ¬µm centered
at the origin and the total power flow in the whole
computational domain. The result is shown in Fig. 4
as a function of R. It is seen that this ratio reaches
95% when R = 15 ¬µm. It starts to drop from 95%
after R = 40 ¬µm in some oscillatory manner and the
ratio is about 90% for R = 62.5 ¬µm. Therefore,
when the MOF of R = 62.5 ¬µm is butt coupled to a
traditional single-mode fiber with core diameter of
5 ¬µm, the coupling ratio would be only 90%.
In conclusion, the fundamental core modes on six-
air-hole MOFs with different cladding radii (R)
have been calculated using the FE-ID-BPM. For
smaller R (<15 ¬µm for the structure studied), the
mode field profile strongly depends on R. When R
is large enough (>20 ¬µm for the structure studied),
the variation of field profile within the cladding
becomes similar although the ratio of power
confined within the core region is found to vary
with R. This ratio for R = 62.5 ¬µm is about 90%.

is usually a Gaussian profile, the scheme will converge to the desired mode and thus the band diagrams
can be obtained.
NUMERICAL RESULTS
We first consider the square-arranged 2-D PC, shown in Fig. 1(a), formed by parallel alumina rods
with radius r = 0.2a in the air, where a is the lattice distance. The cross-sectional view of the PC and
a typical mesh for the unit cell are shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c), respectively. Fig. 2(a) shows the band
diagrams of the TM mode for isotropic rods with relative permittivity x = y = z = 8.9. Besides the
isotropic case, Fig. 2(b) and (c) also respectively shows the band diagrams of the TE mode for anisotropic
rods with x = 11.4 and y = z = 8.9 when k vector varies along path Œì-X-M and path Œì-X
