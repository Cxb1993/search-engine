current proposed methods or the commercial software 
package only can provide the incomplete information 
to decision maker. This project extends the 
discussion of sensitivity analysis from the crisp 
assignment problem and the transportation problem to 
the fuzzy assignment problem and the fuzzy 
transportation. We propose several labeling 
algorithms for obtaining the perturbation ranges of 
advanced sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy assignment 
problem, the transportation problem, and the fuzzy 
transportation problem, which are performed on the 
transportation tableau. The computational results 
show that the proposed algorithms not only can obtain 
the boarder perturbation ranges comparing to the 
conventional methods, but also solve the problems 
quite efficient. Therefore, the proposed algorithms 
can bet applied to solve the real world problems by 
further developing the commercial software packages. 
In this three year project report, there are included 
three topics, which are: (1) the advanced sensitivity 
analysis of the fuzzy assignment problem (Section 
2)； (2) the advanced sensitivity analysis of the 
transportation problem (Section 3)； and (3) the 
advanced sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy 
transportation problem (Section 4).

由於線性規劃問題如指派問題與運輸問題的參數通常是一個估計值，在面對
環境的變動下，例如油價的改變或是工資的上漲，在求解這類數學模型後，通常
會進行成本係數敏感度分析，以判斷當參數改變時所得之最佳解是否依舊可行。
然而，大多數文獻以及商用軟體只能在所求得的最佳基底為非退化時，才能得到
正確的敏感度分析範圍，也就是說退化嚴重的指派問題與運輸問題無法用現有的
方法或是商用軟體求得正確的敏感度分析範圍。此外，本研究計畫亦探討當參數
的變動是來自於主觀的感受，在極大化效用函數值下，延伸探討當成本係數為模
糊數之指派問題與運輸問題或稱為模糊指派問題與模糊運輸問題。文獻中求解運
輸問題最有名的方法為踏石法，該法是在運輸表格上做基底轉移以運算出最佳的
運輸模式。本研究計畫分別針對模糊指派問題、運輸問題與模糊運輸問題，分別
開發出可以在運輸表格上運算的標記演算法，以分別求得成本係數之進階敏感度
分析範圍。從演算結果證實，我們所提出的演算法可以找到比商用套裝軟體更寬
的敏感度分析範圍，可以幫助決策者減少不必要的調整，以減少不必要的花費；
此外，我們所開發的演算法在運輸問題成本係數亦有與縮減模式的計算時間比

1. Introduction 
Linear programming (LP) is one of the most extensively used operations 
research technique in production and operations management (Johnson and 
Montgomery, 1974). As a result of the development of computer technology and the 
rapid evolution of LP software, operation managers can solve LP model easily and 
quickly on a laptop computer. Nowadays, although solving LP model is accessible by 
commercial software packages, such as Lingo, Cplex and GUROBI, the interpretation 
of the solution is relatively difficult. Most of the management science and OR 
textbooks pay special attention to sensitivity analysis, and the problems of degeneracy, 
but sensitivity analysis under degeneracy is rarely discussed. Commercially available 
software only provide incomplete information to the users about the existence and the 
consequences of these, very common, “special cases”. In practice, managers 
frequently misinterpret the LP results which may lead to erroneous decisions and to 
important financial and/or strategic disadvantages. Assignment problem (AP) and 
Transportation problem (TP) are the special type of LP model, and they have been 
widely applied to several practical problems, for instance, AP could be applied to 
solve traveling salesman problem and resource allocation problem. 
The objectives of this project investigate the advanced sensitivity analyses for 
FAP, and FTP, with respect to fuzzy number of cost coefficients and type II and type 
III sensitivity analyses for AP and TP. The optimal solution of the FAP and FTP, 
similar to the AP and TP, which are inherently an extreme point with a high degree of 
primal degeneracy, and usually corresponds to several different optimal bases. Hence, 
the traditional sensitivity analysis, which determines the range in which the current 
optimal basis remains optimal, is impractical. Apparently traditional sensitivity 
analysis is not suitable for AP and TP, as well as the FAP and FTP. Therefore, we try 
to propose the algorithm calculating the difference from the traditional mathematical 
interpretation of sensitivity analysis.  
 
The purpose of this project are summarized as follows: 
1. Induct the concept of fuzzy number for describing the uncertainty of coefficients 
in AP and TP, than construct AP and TP as FAP and FTP, which lead the 
mathematical model of AP and TP much closer to the practical problem. 
2. Develop the algorithm for obtaining the range of coefficient variance of FAP and 
FTP, which would be discussed by the perturbation ranges of advanced sensitivity

2. Advanced Sensitivity Analysis of the Fuzzy Assignment Problem 
2.1 Introduction 
  Costs of Assignment Problem (AP) (Avis and Devroye, 1985) in the practical 
applications are not deterministic numbers, for instance, we assume a minimum cost 
for a worker to perform a job, and greater cost spent may result in higher quality until 
it reaches an upper bound, where an increase in cost does not increase the quality 
anymore. In this case, the costs are no longer deterministic numbers and we will 
denote them as 'ijc s . Further define ijα  as the least cost associated with the worker 
i performing the job j, and ijβ  as the most cost associated with worker i performing 
the job j at the highest quality. Without loss of generality, it is assumed 
that 0 ij ijα β< <  . We further define the quality matrix ijq    where ijq  represents 
the highest quality associated with the worker i performing the job j and 0 1ijq< ≤ . 
In most real cases, we have 0＜qij＜1 and then ijc  is a subnormal fuzzy interval. 
The definition of the membership function of ijc as the linear monotone 
increasing function are shown in (2.1), which shows that any expense exceeding ijβ  
is no longer increased at ijq . Condition xij= 1 is added to (2.1), which is the feasible 
solution of the AP.

In addition, all the αij’s form the matrix [αij] and the βij’s form the matrix [βij]. 
Furthermore, let Tc  denote the total cost, which related to the job performance 
of the manager, and numbers a and b are defined as the lower and upper bounds of 
total cost, respectively. We define the membership function of Tc  as the linear 
monotonically decreasing function in (2.2) and use the notation〈a, b〉to denote fuzzy 
 5 
In AP, due to its special structure, we can only perturb the objective function 
coefficients, 'ijc s . Three types of sensitivity are described here depending on how 
the analysis is performed.  
Let B* be one of the optimal bases of AP with matrix C. Define 
( ){ }* *, | 1, ( , ) Biji j x i jω = = ∈ the corresponding optimal assignment (support set) of 
B* and optimal value C(ω*). According to Koltai and Terlaky (2000), Lin and Wen 
(2003), Hadigheh and Terlaky (2006), and Hadigheh and Terlaky (2007), we 
summarize the three types of sensitivity analysis as follows: 
Type I (Basics Invariancy): Type I sensitivity is the traditional sensitivity analysis, 
as implemented in all commercial LP-packages, which determines the range such that 
the current optimal basic solution remain optimal.  
Type II (Support Set Invariancy): Type II sensitivity, depends on the current 
optimal solution (not necessarily a basic solution), is to determine the range for which 
the positive variables in the current optimal solution remain positive and the same 
holds for zero variables. Hence type II sensitivity range for AP is the range for which 
the current optimal assignment ω*, not the optimal basis B*, remains optimal. 
Type III (Optimal Partition Invariancy): Type III sensitivity, depends only on the 
problem data and perturbing parameter, is to determine the range for which the rate of 
change of optimal objective function value keeps unchanged. In AP, the Type III 
sensitivity range, denoted as " ",pq pqL U   , depends only on which pqc∆  is changing. 
Defining pqf  as the optimal objective function on which pqc∆  is changing, the 
graph of pqf  is composed of several linearity ranges with different slopes. The points 
where the slopes of the optimal function value changes are called breakpoints. Type 
III sensitivity is used just to find the linearity range of pqf , which includes 0pqc∆ = . 
One important case is when pqf  at 0pqc∆ =  happens to be a breakpoint. We define 
such a case as [ ]" ", 0,0pq pqL U  =  . In this case, the positive and negative values of 
pqc∆   
In this project, we investigate Type II and Type III sensitivity analysis for the 
FAP. Degeneracy of optimal solutions causes considerable difficulties in sensitivity 
analysis (Hadigheh and Terlaky, 2006). Therefore we try to propose the theoretical 
foundation and develop the algorithm for calculating the difference from the 
traditional mathematical interpretation of sensitivity analysis.

Since f  has been updated, it is also needed to update the 1,..., nu u , 1,..., nv v . We 
keep all iu  unchanged, and update values of jv ← j ijv θ γ− ⋅ ,  for 1, 2,...,  j n= ; 
( ),i j E∈ , where θ  is the difference of new and original optimal values. Then we 
update each ijδ ← iu + jv + ijα + f⋅ ijγ , for ( , )i j E∉ . 
Step 2:Since the optimal assignment remains optimal, let all ijδ ≥ 0, and then we have 
some inequalities of st∆ . Derive intersection of these inequalities, denoted as 
stL ≤ st∆ ≤ stU , where stL  and stU  occur at cell (a, b) and (c, d) respectively. Go to 
Phase 1. 
Phase 1:  
In Phase 1, we expand the lower bounded until we have derived the exact lower 
bound of type II range. This phase begins with the table obtained in Phase 0. 
Step 1: If stL  is unbounded, go to Phase 2; otherwise, assume st∆ < stL . Choose (a, b) 
as the pivot cell and proceed with the following labeling procedure. If row a has not 
been labeled, go to Step 2; otherwise, stop and current stL  is the exact lower bound 
of the type II range. 
Step 2: Let J={( i , j)｜ ijδ >0 and row i  is labeled, whereas column j is not labeled},

min iji j Jε δ∈=  as st∆  approach stL . If row i  is labeled, then i iu u ε← − . If 
column j is labeled, j jv v ε← +  and we then update related ijδ . Erase all labels and 
go to Step 3. 
Step 3: Check if all ijδ >0 under perturbation condition st∆ < stL . If it is, then update 
stL  through the interaction of inequalities of ijδ ≥0, and suppose new stL  occur at 
cell (a, b), then return to Step 1. Otherwise, fine tsˆˆδ <0 is the most negative, choose 
( sˆ , tˆ ) as the pivot cell and proceed with the labeling procedure. Proceed with the 
labeling procedure until further labeling is impossible. If row sˆ  has not been labeled, 
then go to Step 2; otherwise, stop and current stL  is exact lower bound of the type II 
range. 
Phase 2:

breakpoint in problem (4.3), then the stα∆ ’s Type II and Type III sensitivity ranges 
are identical. 
Theorem 2.2. In problem (4.3), either the lower bound or the upper bound of stα∆ ’s 
Type II sensitivity range is 0, the optimal objective function stf  at stα∆ =0 is a 
breakpoint and we defined stα∆ ’s Type III sensitivity range = [ ]0,0 . 
Theorem 2.3. Suppose that the optimal objective function stf  at stα∆ =0 is a 
breakpoint in problem (4.3), the stα∆ ’s Type II sensitivity range will either be the 
immediate left-side or right-side linear range of stf  at stα∆ =0. 
 
2.3.1 Slopes of fst at Origin When Perturb the Unassigned Cell 
Check if stf  at 0st∆ =  is a breakpoint or not. If it is, let [ ]0,0st∆ ∈  and the 
right-side slope of the optimal objective function is equal to zero. Consequently, 
increasing the perturbation of the unassigned cell will not change the optimal 
functional value. Decreasing the perturbation of breakpoint in the unassigned cell will 
change the optimal function value; hence we need to calculate the left-side slope of 
the optimal objective function as follows: 
 
Perturbation in ijα  and ijβ  at the same variation:

summarize Type II sensitivity ranges of perturbation in ijα  and ijβ  with the same 
variation while keep the ijγ  unchanged in Table 2.3. Compare with Type I sensitivity 
ranges in Table 2.2, we show that Type I sensitivity range is a subset of Type II 
sensitivity range since changing the optimal basis does not ensure that the optimal 
assignment will be changed.

Using the similar labeling procedure for the type II sensitivity analysis, we can

2.5 Conclusion 
We propose two labeling algorithms to perform the type II and type III sensitivity 
analysis of the FAP respectively. The AP is to assign jobs to workers so as to minimize 
the total cost. However, in practice, the managers attempt not only to minimize the 
total cost, but also to promote the quality of all jobs. We assume the costs are no more 
deterministic numbers but functions of the quality level, and then investigate the FAP. 
The optimal solution of the FAP, some as the AP, is inherently an extreme point with a 
high degree of primal degeneracy, and usually corresponds to several different optimal 
bases. Therefore, the traditional sensitivity analysis or Type I sensitivity analysis, 
which determines the range in which the current optimal basis remains primal, is 
impractical. Commercially available software does not give enough information to the 
user about the existence and the consequences when degeneracy occurs. Hence, we 
present Type II SA and Type III SA algorithms to perform practically other two types 
of sensitivity analysis-- Type II and Type III sensitivity analysis. Type II sensitivity 
analysis is to determine the range of perturbation to keep the current optimal 
assignment remaining optimal, and Type III sensitivity analysis is to determine the 
range for which the rate of change of optimal objective function value to keep 
unchanged. Base on the proposed Type II SA algorithm and Type III SA algorithm, we 
can have information of these two sensitivity analyses. The procedure of the proposed 
Type II SA algorithm and Type III SA algorithm is primarily divided into two parts: 
one is when the perturbation occurs in an unassigned cell, and the other is when the 
perturbation occurs in an assigned cell. Both parts are proceeding on the same 
concepts that make the procedure easy to implement.

According to condition (3.2), one of the constraints of supply and demand in 
(3.1) can be deleted and the number of basic cells is m + n −1 in a basic solution of 
(3.1). When the number of positive basic cells in a basic solution is less than m + n −1, 
the solution is degenerate. Let *X ={ *ijx } be the given and implemented optimal 
solution of TP. When *X  is non-degenerate, the optimal basis *B  is the shipping 
pattern. Further, define *P = {( i , j ): *ijx >0, ( i , j )∈ *ijx } and 
*Z = {( i , j ): *ijx = 0, 
( i , j )∈ *ijx }. 
*P  is called the support set of *X . In the DTP, *P  is a proper subset 
of *B  and the real shipping pattern since degenerate basic cells make no 
transportation routes. 
After the optimal solution is achieved, sensitivity analysis is usually carried out 
due to the problem data often not being exactly known and estimated under 
uncertainty. Ordinary sensitivity analysis, which perturbs a single parameter at a time, 
is the most widely used type of sensitivity analysis. Suppose cost pqc  is the 
perturbed parameter with variation abΔ , the perturbed TP can be formulated as model 
(3.3).

Wen (2007) considered the sensitivity analysis for the perturbation of 
multi-parameters of the AP simultaneously. Lin (2011) considered the sensitivity 
analysis for the fractional assignment problem. Lin, et al., (2011) developed the 
algorithm with the Labeling procedure to find the Type II and III ranges of the fuzzy 
assignment problem. 
No commercial software package deals with Type II sensitivity analysis of DTP. 
Current software packages give the Type I range, which is only suitable when *B  is 
non-degenerate. In addition, degenerate *B  implies there are other optimal bases 
mapping to the same optimal solution. Usually, different software packages provide 
different optimal bases, yielding different Type I ranges. Therefore, there results are 
misleading for the DTP. The Type II range is practical for the DTP. An approach to 
determine the Type II range is to enumerate all optimal basic solutions and all primal 
optimal basic solutions mapping to the same optimal solution of *X  (Jansen et al., 
1997; Ward and Wendell, 1990). Then, the union of each Type I range corresponding 
to each of these bases will be in the Type II range. However, this approach is quite 
tedious. 
The purpose of this section is to propose two labeling algorithms, which are 
extended from Balinski and Gomory’s algorithm (Balinski and Gomory, 1967), to 
determine the Type II ranges for the cost coefficient of the DTP using just *X . The 
rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 3.2, three lemmas are provided 
for determining the upper bound or lower bound of the Type II ranges directly under 
specific conditions of the DTP. In Section 3.3, we propose two labeling algorithms for 
determining the Type II ranges of the cost coefficients. A numerical example is 
presented to demonstrate the proposed algorithms in Section 3.4. Section 3.5 
concludes the study with a brief summary. 
 
3.2 Specific conditions of Type II range for the DTP 
In this section, the formulas for Type II range of LP are applied to derive two 
Type II ranges under specific conditions of the DTP. The following theorem 1 of LP is 
well known and useful later. 
 
Theorem 3.1. Let the primal problem be feasible. If the dual problem is infeasible, 
then the optimal value of the primal problem is unbounded. 
Denote labγ  and 
u
abγ  as the lower bound and upper bound of abΔ ’s Type II 
range, respectively. Then, uabγ  and 
l
abγ  are the maximum and minimum of model

Model (3.7) is infeasible since the constraint aby  = −1 contradicts the constraint 
aby ≥ 0 implied in ijy ≥ 0, ( i , j )∈
*Z . By theorem 1, the objective value of model 
(3.6) is unbounded. Thus, we have uabγ → ∞ when ( a , b )∈
*Z . 
 
Lemma 3.2. If ( a , b )∈ *P  and *abx  is the unique positive optimal variable of 
*X  
in row a  of the transportation tableau, then labγ → −∞. 
 
Proof: By model (3.5), the labγ  wanted is the optimal value of model (3.8): 
min  abΔ  
s.t.  iu + jv + ijλ = ijc    for ( i , j )∈
*P , ( i , j )≠( a ,b )

ijλ ≥ 0    for ( i , j )∉
*P

Since *abx  is the unique positive optimal variable of 
*X  in row a , aby  = −1, and 
 21 
according to Lemma 3.1. 
Algorithm 1: 
Step 0: Initialization 
Suppose ( a ,b )∈ *Z  is the perturbed cell in the implemented optimal solution 
*X . 
Step1: Update abc  and abλ  
Update abc ← abc + abΔ , and abλ ← abλ + abΔ , where abΔ  denotes the variation 
of abc . 
Step2: Labeling procedure 
(1) By setting abλ ≥ 0, which is the optimal condition of TP, we can obtain (update) 
the current best labγ . 
(2) Select ( a ,b ) as the pivot cell, implying the assumption abΔ <
l
abγ . We then set k 
← a , l ← b , and proceed with the Labeling procedure. 
Step3: Termination criterion 
If row a  has been labeled, we stop the algorithm and the current best labγ  is 
the final labγ . If row a  has not received a label, we go to Step 4.  
Step4: Revaluing procedure 
Perform the Revaluing procedure, and go to step 2. 
 
The following Algorithm 2 is proposed to determine labγ  and 
u
abγ  of abΔ 's Type II 
range when the perturbation occurs at ( a ,b )∈ *P . If *abx  is the unique positive 
optimal basic variable in either row a  or column b  of the transportation tableau, 
then we have labγ → −∞ by lemma 2 or 3, respectively. Phase 1 of Algorithm 2 is then 
omitted. 
Algorithm 2: 
Phase 0: 
Step 0: Initialization  
Suppose ( a ,b )∈ *P  is the perturbed cell in the implemented optimal solution 
*X . 
Step1: Update the related ijλ  
(1) Update abc ← abc + abΔ . 
(2) Give label () to row a  and label (#) to column b . 
(3) If column q has received label (#), then we label row i  with (#) where iqx >0. 
If row i  had received label () or (#), we keep its original label.

(3,3)}. Solution *X  is degenerate and *P  is the real shipping pattern. Thus, Type II 
sensitivity analysis is suitable for *X .

The following Type II Sensitivity analysis is composed of two cases, the first is 
for the perturbation occurring at ( a , b )∈ *Z and the other is for it occurring at 
( a ,b )∈ *P . We take cells (2, 1) and (2, 4) as the examples, respectively. 
 
3.4.1 Type II Range of 21Δ  
Suppose (2, 1)∈ *Z  is the perturbed cell and 21∆  is the variation of 21c . We 
can know u21γ → ∞ by Lemma 1 and only need to determine 
l
21γ . 
Step 1: Update 21c  and 21λ , as shown in Table 3.3. 
 
 
 
 25 
Step2: By setting 21λ = 11+ 21∆ ≥ 0, we update the current best 
l
21γ = −11. Again, 
select (2, 1) as the pivot cell, and proceed with the Labeling procedure as 
shown in Table 6. 
Step3: The termination criterion is satisfied since row 2 has been labeled. Hence, we 
conclude l21γ = −11.

3.4.2 Type II range of 24Δ  
Suppose (2, 4) is the perturbed cell and 24∆  is the variation of 24c . Now that 
*
24x  is neither the unique positive optimal variable in row 2 nor in column 4 of Table 
3.2, Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 cannot be applied. 
Step 1: Update 3u , 4v , 14λ , 31λ , 32λ  and 33λ , as shown in Table 3.7.

u
24γ =16 
which occurs at cell (3, 1) and cell (1, 4), respectively. Go to Phase 1. 
Step 3: Select (3, 1) as the pivot cell, implying the assumption 24∆ < 0. We proceed

3.4.3 Discussion 
All the abΔ 's Type I and Type II ranges are summarized in Table 3.12, which 
are obtained by LINGO and our proposed labeling algorithms, respectively. Figure 3.1 
shows the comparison of Type I and Type II ranges for each abΔ . The lower bound of 
the Type I ranges are greater than or equal to the Type II range; on the other hand, the 
upper bound of the Type I ranges are less than or equal to the Type II range. 
Accordingly, the Type II ranges provide broader perturbation ranges, i.e., less 
sensitive ranges for decision maker.

coded by C++ of Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and run on an Intel Core i7-2600 PC 
with 4GB RAM, under the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. The experiment 
has three levels, which are the problem sizes (m, n)= (10, 30), (30, 50), and (50, 100). 
There are 10 replications at each level. The cost coefficients of each test problem vary 
uniformly between 1 and 5(m+n)/2. With respect to RHS parameters of each test 
problem, we generate m-1 variables Ri which vary uniformly between 1 and 100(m+n), 
then sort the random variables in ascending order. Each si is determined by Ri- Ri-1. 
The process of generating demand values are similar to supply values. Table 3.13 
shows the computation time of the proposed algorithms as well as the LINGO 
software.

3.5 Conclusion 
This section of report examined the Type II range of cost coefficients in the DTP. 
The conventional Type I sensitivity analysis and commercial software package are 
based on the assumption of non-degeneracy. Since the DTP is a degenerate LP, Type I 
sensitivity analysis provides incomplete information of the perturbation range for the 
DTP. The Type II range obtains an exact perturbation range, which keeps the optimal 
solution with a positive value remaining positive and zero values remaining zero. 
Therefore, Type II sensitivity analysis preserves the shipping pattern and is more 
practical than Type I sensitivity analysis. In this paper, three lemmas are proved, 
which demonstrate the properties for the Type II range of the DTP. Further, two 
labeling algorithms for determining the Type II range with respect to cost coefficients 
are proposed. They can provide correct information to decision-makers. Besides, we 
also provide a comparison of our proposed algorithm with the commercial software 
Lingo, the computation time of the proposed labeling algorithms is quite short and 
more efficient than that of the LINGO software.Finally, sensitivity analysis of 
unbalanced perturbation of the RHS parameters for the DTP would be an interesting 
and practical direction for further research.

coefficients and proposed an algorithm (Chanas and Kuchta, 1996). Shih (1999) 
employed Zimmermann’s approach, Chanas’s approach, and Julien’s approach to 
formulate the fuzzy LP model for TP with fuzzy cost coefficients and RHS values. 
Sakawa et al. (2001a) formulated mixed 0-1 programming problems that minimize the 
cost of production problem and TP and subject to capacities of factories and demands 
of regions. Then the authors presented the fuzzy programming for production problem 
and TP. Liu and Kao (2004) not only considered fuzzy supply and demand values, but 
also considered the fuzzy cost coefficients. The authors discuss the equality constants 
and inequality constraints in FTP, and the result show that the membership function of 
the objective value of the equality problem is contained in the inequality problem. In 
nowadays, the concept of fuzzy has been widely applied in the other mathematical 
programming models (Baykasoglu and Gocken, 2008). However few papers discuss 
the sensitivity analysis of the fuzzy TP. 
Let B* be one of the optimal bases of the TP with matrix C. Define 
( ){ }* *, | 0, ( , ) Biji j x i jω = > ∈ the corresponding optimal shipping pattern (support set) 
of B* and optimal value C(ω*). According to Koltai and Terlaky (2000), Lin and Wen 
(2003), Hadigheh and Terlaky (2006), and Hadigheh and Terlaky (2007), we 
summarize the types I and II of sensitivity analysis as follows: 
 
Type I (Basics Invariancy): Type I sensitivity is the conventional sensitivity analysis, 
which determines the range that the current optimal basic solution remain optimal.  
Type II (Support Set Invariancy): Type II sensitivity depends on the current optimal 
solution, is to determine the range for which the positive variables in the current 
optimal solution remain positive and the same holds for zero variables. Hence type II 
sensitivity range for TP is the range for which the current optimal shipping pattern ω*, 
not the optimal basis B*, remains optimal. 
In summarized, we investigate Type II sensitivity analysis for the Fuzzy TP in 
the third year’s report. As our best understanding, degeneracy of optimal solutions 
causes considerable difficulties in sensitivity analysis (Hadigheh and Terlaky, 2006, 
Ma et al., 2013). Therefore, in the rest of the section, a labeling algorithm is proposed 
to obtain the perturbation ranges of the fuzzy TP with respect to the Type II sensitivity 
analysis in section 4.2. Then, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the 
result of our proposed algorithm in section 4.3. A brief conclusion and suggestion are 
provide in the section 4.4.

Step 2: Since klδ ≥ 0, we have kl∆ ≥ klL . Let kl∆ < klL , choose ( , )k l  as the pivot cell 
and proceed with the labeling procedure. If row k has no label, go to Step 3; 
otherwise, stop and current inequality kl∆ ≥ klL  is the type II range. 
Step 3: Let J={( i ,j)｜ ijδ >0 and row i  is labeled, whereas column j is not labeled} 
and { }min , where ( , )ij i j Jε δ= ∈ . If row i  (≠k) is labeled, then i iu u ε← − ; and 
if column j is labeled, then j jv v ε← +  and then update related ijδ . Erase all 
labels and return to Step 2. 
 
4.3.2 Type II SA algorithm for perturbation in the assigned cell 
Suppose ( , )k l is the perturbed cell and ( , )k l *ω∈ , then the procedure for 
determining stU  and stL  are shown as follows: 
Phase 0: 
Step 1: Update optimal value f as shown in Table 2.1. 
 
If perturbation occurs in klα  and klβ  with the same variation kl∆ , then

Since f  has been updated, 1,..., nu u , 1,..., nv v  also needed to update. We keep all 
iu  unchanged, and update values of jv ← j ijv θ γ− ⋅ ,  for 1, 2,...,  j n= ; ( ) *,i j ω∈ , 
where θ  is the difference of new and original optimal values. Then we update each 
ijδ ← iu + jv + ijα + f⋅ ijγ , for 
*( , )i j ω∈ . 
Step 2: Since the optimal shipping pattern remains optimal, let all ijδ ≥ 0, and then we 
have some inequalities of kl∆ . Derive intersection of these inequalities, denoted as 
klL ≤ kl∆ ≤ klU , where klL  and klU  occur at cell (a, b) and (c, d) respectively, 
because the pivot cells are not located at (k, l). Go to Phase 1. 
Phase 1:  
This phase begins with the table obtained in Phase 0. 
Step 1: If klL  is unbounded, go to Phase 2; otherwise, assume kl∆ < klL . Select (a, b) 
as the pivot cell and proceed with the following labeling procedure. If row a has 
not been labeled, go to Step 2; otherwise, stop and current klL  is the exact lower 
bound of the type II range. 
Step 2: Let J={( i , j)｜ ijδ >0 and row i  is labeled, whereas column j is not labeled}, 
{ }min , where ( , )ij i j Jε δ= ∈  as st∆  approach stL . If row i  is labeled, then

Finally, s1= 5, s2= 12, s3= 8, and d1= 10, d2= 10, d3= 5. 
Then, we obtain a=94 by (4.3), and b= 252 by (4.4). f= 0.460641. The optimal 
solution of the example is illustrated as Table 4.1. 
 
4.4.1 Perturbation in the Zero Cell 
We assume the perturbations occur in 11α  and 11β  with the same variation. Update 
11α ← 11α + 11∆  and 11β ← 11β + 11∆ .  
Step 1:  
Update 11δ ←0.5+ 11∆ , and go to Step 2.

Phase 1:  
This phase also begins with the table obtained in Phase 0. 
Step 1: Assume 22∆ < 22L . Select (a, b) as the pivot cell and proceed with the following 
labeling procedure as shown in table 4.5. Since row 3 has been labeled, erase all 
labels in the table 4.5, and go to step 3. 
Step 3: If ijδ >0, ∀ij, then update 22 5L = , then go to phase II. 
Phase 2:  
This phase begins with the table obtained in Phase 0. 
 
Step 1: Assume 22∆ > 22U . Select (1, 2) as the pivot cell and proceed with the following

4.4.3 Computational Result and Discussion 
The perturbation ranges of type II sensitivity of the fuzzy transportation problem 
are shown in Table 4.8. Like the results in the transportation and the fuzzy assignment 
problem, the optimal shipping patterns with zero value always have no upper bound, 
i.e. increase to infinity. The optimal shipping patterns with positive value have no 
lower bounds, i.e. decrease to negative infinity. However, in case perturbing the 
optimal shipping pattern with positive value has other optimal shipping pattern with 
positive value in the same row and the same column has a lower bound, e.g. lower 
bound of cell (2, 2) is -5. Since the cost of each cell is a fuzzy number and the total 
cost is also a fuzzy number, the results of perturbation ranges are more complex than 
the transportation problem. Nevertheless, the numerical example demonstrates that 
our proposed algorithm still available to obtain the type II sensitivity analysis of fuzzy 
TP.

本研究計畫探討指派與運輸問題成本係數進階敏感度分析。我們將運輸問題之參數不確
定性分成主觀與客觀兩種類型，客觀之參數不確定來源來自於被動的影響，如油價；而主觀
之參數不確定性則來自於人為，例如增加每條路徑的運輸成本，可縮短運輸的時間，然而部
門經理對於總成本又設下門檻。在求解到運輸問題的最佳解後，接著再進行敏感度分析。然
而，文獻大多著重在如何求解模糊運輸問題與模糊指派問題，除此之外，在文獻中所提出的
敏感度分析方法與商用軟體所提供的敏感度分析範圍，皆是建立在最佳解基底為非退化的假
設下，對於高度退化的指派問題與運輸問題會得到不完整的敏感度分析範圍，進而提供決策
者不正確的訊息。我們利用提出的標記演算法分別針對模糊指派問題、運輸問題與模糊運輸
問題分別找出敏感度分析範圍。與傳統的方法比較，進階敏感度分析範圍可在基底為退化的
狀況下得到更大的敏感度分析範圍。較大的敏感度分析範圍避免決策者進行不必要的調整，
以節省不必要的浪費。在求解時間上，我們所提供的標記演算法可以較文獻中所提出的輔助
縮減問題有較快的求解時間，未來可望可以將此技術推廣至商用套裝軟體中，使決策者都能
獲得最完整的資訊以利做出最正確的判斷。
