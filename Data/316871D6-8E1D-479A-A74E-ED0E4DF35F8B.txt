由於圖 10(b)的等效模型只有一個描述

仍然無法符合量測到的結果，這代表圖 10(b)

也由於圖 10(b)的等效模型太過於簡略，以
至於 Q 值曲線無法符合量測的結果。在高

(2)
The oscillating will occur if the circuit loop gain is unity, cor-
responding to a voltage gain with the oscillation
frequency at . With a proper arrangement, the oscillation fre-
quency ( ) can be approximated by
(3)
In addition, the required transconductance ( ) to sustain
the oscillation can be derived as
(4)
From (4), it is observed that the required transconductance
( ) for VCO startup can be reduced by increasing the
transconductance ( ).
As for the consideration of VCO operating at microwave
frequencies, the realization of varactors becomes an important
topic. Fig. 3(a) shows the terminal connection of a conventional
NMOS varactor with the drain (D), source (S), and body (B)
connected together as one node of the varactor, and the other
node is with polysilicon gate (G). Based on the 0.18 CMOS
process, the simulated capacitance at 19 GHz for a conventional
NMOS varactor with device size
is depicted in Fig. 4(a). It is observed that the capacitance
varies non-monotonically due to the operation in accumu-
lation, depletion, and inversion regions. Fig. 3(b) shows the
inversion-mode NMOS varactor, the drain (D) and source
(S) are shorted together as one varactor terminal while the
polysilicon gates (G) forms the other. By connecting the body
terminal (B) to ground, the NMOS varactor can only operate
in the inversion region. The overall capacitance variance can
be increased as described in Fig. 4(a), leading to an improved
VCO tuning ranging. However, the simulated quality factor of
inversion-mode NMOS varactor in Fig. 4(b) is reduced from
the conventional NMOS varactor. In order to overcome this
difficulty, a combination of the inversion-mode NMOS varactor
and the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor is proposed

and illustrated in Fig. 3(c). From Fig. 4(b), it obviously shows
that the quality factor of the proposed varactor is effectively
enhanced. However, the capacitance variance range of the
proposed varactor is shrunk as shown in Fig. 4(a). Therefore, a
design consideration has to be taken for the tradeoff between
varactor capacitance and quality factor. In this design, the
approach shown in Fig. 3(c) is adopted for achieving higher
factor and acceptable tuning range.
According to [1], the phase noise of a VCO is dominated by its
resonator. For this work, the resonator consists of transformers,
metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors ( and ), and
-factor enhanced varactor. To improve factor and minimize
chip area of the transformer, this transformer is constructed with
broadside coupled topology and incorporated with high-resis-
tance shielding structure as shown in Fig. 5(a). Fig. 5(b) shows
the simulated factors and coupling coefficients of the trans-
formerswithandwithouthigh-resistanceshieldingstructure.The
factor of the transformer with shielding structure at 19 GHz is
23, and the coupling coefficient is 0.955. The microphotograph
of the fabricated VCO is shown in Fig. 5(c). The size of the trans-
former incorporated with high-resistance shielding structure is
0.238 0.175 and theoverall chipsize including the testing
pads is 0.38 0.63 . In addition, the simulated factors of
the 180-fF and 480 fF at 19 GHz are 244 and 51.4, re-
spectively. From these simulated factors, it is found that the
factor of the resonator in this work is dominated by the varactor
due to its lowest factor. Therefore, enhancing factor of the
varactor of this work can lead to low phase noise.

A CMOS Colpitts VCO Using Negative-Conductance
Boosted Technology
To-Po Wang, Member, IEEE
Abstract—A circuit topology suitable for a low-voltage
low-power Colpitts voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is
presented in this paper. By employing inductors for a nega-
tive-conductance boosted structure, the dc power consumption
of the Colpitts VCO can be effectively reduced. Based on the
proposed architecture, the VCO fabricated in 0.18- m CMOS
exhibits a measured 1.3% tuning range around 30 GHz. Oper-
ating at a supply voltage of 1.0 V, the VCO core consumes 2.3-mW
dc power, and the measured phase noise is     dBc Hz at
1-MHz offset. Compared to the recently published 20- to 30-GHz
0.18- m CMOS VCOs, this work achieves a reduced supply
voltage, minimized dc power consumption, small chip size, supe-
rior figure-of-merit (FOM), and better figure-of-merit including
the tuning range FOM . Formulas for considering the nonlinear
characteristics of varactors and active devices are also presented,
and the accuracy of predicting the VCO tuning curve is validated
by measurement.

controlled oscillator (VCO).
I. INTRODUCTION
A S the CMOS feature size advances to the deep-submicronrange, CMOS oscillators with fundamental frequencies
up to the millimeter-wave (mm-wave) range have been reported.
However, such oscillators usually suffer from -factor degra-
dation in passive components, leading to poor VCO phase noise
and difficult startup conditions [1].
To overcome these difficulties, injection locking with an ex-
ternal stable signal source is adopted for dividers and VCOs to
minimize the frequency and phase fluctuation [2]–[4]. To re-
duce the inconvenience for the external signal sources, reducing
the phase noise of an X-band push-push oscillator by using
the second-harmonic self-injection technique has been proposed
[5].
To improve the factors of on-chip passive components,
the micro-machining techniques are applied to reduce the
loss due to the parasitic coupling effects existing between the
passive structures and lossy Si-substrates [6], [7]. Moreover,
low-phase-noise oscillators utilizing the micromachined passive
components with high -factors have been demonstrated [8],

[9]. However, such a solution requires additional post-CMOS
processes, leading to another challenge in predicting the circuit
performance and product yields. With the continuous shrinking
of transistor sizes, the supply voltages must be scaled down
proportionally, due to issues with gate-oxide reliability [10].
Unfortunately, the accordingly low transconductance of the
MOSFETs at millimeter-wave frequencies has seriously af-
fected the low-voltage low-power RF-frontend designs.
In this paper, a differential Colpitts VCO with an oscillation
frequency around 30 GHz with a low supply voltage and low
dc power consumption is proposed. With a negative-conduc-
tance boosted structure, the required transconductance for the
startup condition of the Colpitts VCO can be relaxed. This re-
laxed startup condition also allows reduction of the dc power
consumption. In addition, a nonlinear analysis is applied for this
Colpitts VCO, which accounts for the nonlinear effect of both
the varactors and active devices.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the proposed
differential Colpitts VCO is introduced. The design considera-
tions and nonlinear analysis are presented. Section III describes
the circuit implementation. Section IV gives the experimental
results and characterization. Finally, a conclusion is provided in
Section V.
II. PROPOSED DIFFERENTIAL COLPITTS VCO
The circuit topologies of the regular differential Colpitts
VCOs are shown in Fig. 1 [11]. In Fig. 1(b), the Colpitts VCO
consists of two identical single-ended Colpitts VCOs and a
cross-coupled pair – . The common nodes of the iden-
tical VCOs are the virtual ground at the odd mode and the open
circuit at the even mode. Common-gate transistors – ,
feedback capacitors ( , and ), and varactors are
used to provide the negative conductance. The Colpitts VCO

respectively. The 0.4-V is much lower than the turn-on
voltage of a P-N junction, and the induced bulk current is
very small (1.19 pA). As a result, the leakage current can be
neglected in this design.
Fig. 5 shows the simulated drain current and threshold voltage
of the MOSFET as a function of forward-body bias
for various transistor sizes. The bias voltages of the negative-
conductance boosted structure are V and
V. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the threshold voltage of
the device m m used in this VCO can be
reduced from 0.53 V to 0.44 V by increasing the forward-body
bias from 0 V to 0.4 V, leading to a 90-mV threshold
voltage reduction. The corresponding drain current is increased
from 0.2 mA to 0.49 mA. According to these simulated results,
the threshold voltage is reduced by raising the bulk bias ,
leading to the reduced supply voltage V and the
lowest dc power consumption (2.3 mW) for sustaining the VCO
oscillation. To provide the bulk voltage , a voltage divider
circuit consisting of two high-value resistors can be constructed.
As a result, the dc current flow through the voltage divider is
very small, and the raised dc power consumption due to the
voltage divider circuit can be ignored.
To further boost the negative conductance at low
supply voltage with low dc-power consumption, the on-chip in-
ductor is combined with the cross-coupled pair. From the
equivalent half circuit shown in Fig. 3(b), the negative conduc-
tance from can be derived as shown in (2) at the
bottom of the page.
The imaginary part of the can be written as shown in
(3) at the bottom of the page.
In the typical design, , ,
and are provided. Consequently, the
expression of in (2) can be approximated to
(4)
For general cases, it is apparent that is satis-
fied. Therefore, the negative conductance in formula
(4) can be boosted by inserting the on-chip inductors .
For better understanding of the influences of the on-chip
inductors , the simulated negative conductance
and imaginary part of input admittance versus fre-
quency based on the device models of a 0.18- m CMOS
process are shown in Fig. 6. The design parameters are
m m, V,
and V. From Fig. 6(a), it can be seen that the neg-
ative conductance can be boosted from mS to
mS at 30 GHz due to the additional 0.52-nH inductor
. Moreover, the imaginary part of is approximately
zero, as shown in Fig. 6(b), leading to the neglected influence
on phase shift at the tank and phase offset at the output. It
is also observed that the negative conductance can
be enhanced from 20 to 40 GHz due to the 0.52-nH .
Therefore, this 0.52-nH can be adopted for this Colpitts
VCO design with a tuning range from 29.61 to 30.02 GHz.
As can be seen in Fig. 6(a), the most effectively enhanced neg-
ative conductance is mS at 30 GHz due to the
0.52-nH , but it raises the rapid transition in the imaginary
part of at 30 GHz, shown in Fig. 6(b). To fabricate the
VCO circuit, the rapid changing of the imaginary part of
will raise the poor tolerance to process variation. It also affects
the phase shift of the tank voltage and current. In order to elim-
inate these influences on the 30-GHz Colpitts VCO, the simu-
lated negative conductance and imaginary part of the
input admittance at 30 GHz versus inductance

with respect to capacitance ratio from 0 to
4 for various inductor quality factors are
shown in Fig. 9. As can be seen in this figure, the can be
reduced by increasing the quality factor or by increasing
the capacitance ratio . For this 30-GHz Colpitts VCO,
it is noted that the value of transconductance cannot be
equal to zero because there would be no dc current path for
the negative—conductance boosted structure if the MOSFETs
– were turned off.
C. Nonlinear Analysis
To perform the nonlinear analysis of the VCO circuit
shown in Fig. 2, the equations at drain terminals of transistors
– can be written in the following form:
(11)
(12)
where , , ,
and are the charge-voltage characteristics of
the varactors and capacitors.
To derive the nonlinearities of the proposed VCO circuit,
a perturbation parameter representing the circuit losses is
adopted [12], [15]–[18]. Assume that the active nonlinearities
and the strictly nonlinear part of the varactor characteristics are
related to the perturbation parameter. By separating the linear
and the strictly nonlinear parts of the characteristic for the ac-
tive devices and for the varactors, the following (13)–(18) are
obtained:
(13)

where , , , ,
, and are the strictly nonlinear
components. The is a small perturbation parameter, which is
associated with the circuit loss. Substituting (13)–(18) into (11)
and (12), the equations become
(19)
(20)
From (9), the oscillation frequency of the Colpitts VCO is
(21)
Formula (21) can be simplified to because of
in this particular circuit design. The angular
frequency of the periodic solutions
for (19) and (20) are related to the small perturbation param-
eter . Therefore, the angular frequency can be written as
, where the is the frequency deviation nor-
malized to . To solve (19) and (20), the variables
and are introduced. As a result,
(19) and (20) become
(22)

To analyze the nonlinearity of transistors, the standard
MOSFET model is used for considering the nonlinear char-
acteristic of the transistors – . The device size of

Substituting (26) and (27), (29) and (30), (33) into (22) and
assume the is approximate to [15], [16], the formula
(22) can then be simplified to

To obtain the periodic solution of in (34), can be written
in the form
(35)
where is the complex amplitude of the th harmonic of
the periodic function [15], [16]. The harmonic amplitudes and
the angular frequency can be written in the form of power series
(36)
Substituting (35) and (36) into (34), balancing the and
terms, and imposing the coefficients of the terms with same
power of , the equation for the amplitude of the fundamental
harmonic can be derived as

consider the first-order approximation to the periodic solution,
the voltage waveform at the source terminal of MOSFET

are removed. From this figure, it is observed that the two voltage
swings are similar.
To characterize the oscillation frequency, the nonlinear (31)

, and is about 0.7 V in this VCO design. The tuning
curve of the Colpitts VCO characterized by the EDA tools, for-
mula (40), and measurement are shown in Fig. 12. As can be
seen in this figure, the frequency discrepancy between formula
(40) and measurement is within 0.29%.
D. Phase Noise Consideration
The characterization of phase noise is also an important as-
pect of VCO design [19]–[24]. For a regular VCO, the close-in
phase noise is dominated by the flicker noise of the tail cur-
rent source and switching transistor. The flicker noise of the
tail current sources ( in Fig. 1) will be up-converted to the
close-in phase noise through the AM-to-FM conversion mech-
anism. Moreover, the variations of output voltage swing and
varactor’s common-mode voltage cause the change in oscilla-
tion frequency and thus degrade the phase noise [19], [25]–[27].
Furthermore, the flicker noise from the switching transistors
( – in Fig. 1(b)) modulates the second harmonic current at
the common-source node and increases the close-in phase noise
due to the mixing operation through these switching transistors
[19], [28]–[30].
The mechanism of phase noise behavior for a VCO with re-
spect to the tail current can be divided into two regions. In the
first region, the VCO operates under the current-limited mode.
In this region, the tail current governs the steady-state oscil-
lation amplitude. Therefore, the noise of the tail current
source ( in Fig. 1) produces low frequency random ampli-
tude modulation (AM). This random AM envelope modulates
the effective capacitance of the varactors, converting the AM to
frequency modulation (AM-to-FM conversion). The FM side-
bands appear as close-in phase noise [28]. In the second region,
the VCO operates under the voltage-limited mode. The

tion of     for various  values.
substrate noise isolation can be achieved by the isolated well
[34].
III. CIRCUIT IMPLEMENTATION
The proposed 30-GHz negative-conductance boosted dif-
ferential Colpitts VCO is implemented in a 0.18- m CMOS
process which has a single poly layer and six metal layers. For
circuits operating at millimeter-wave frequencies, transistors
with a minimum channel length of 0.18- m are implemented in
a multi-finger layout to reduce the gate resistances. In addition,
the process provides the polysilicon resistors, metal-insu-
lator-metal (MIM) capacitors with oxide internal dielectric,
and top AlCu metallization layer with a 2- m thickness. For
the capacitors ( and ) in Fig. 2, the is a metal–insu-
lator–metal (MIM) capacitor, and the is a MOS varactor.
The inductors adopted in this Colpitts VCO are implemented
on the 2- m-thick top metal, and the simulated factor of this
0.12-nH inductor is approximately 25.6.
The MOSFETs – for the Colpitts VCO shown in
Fig. 2 have been fabricated in deep Nwell (DNW) [33]. The sub-
strate biasing of – is achieved through the current-lim-
iting resisters . However, the bulks (B) of NMOS transis-
tors – are connected to the source terminals (S). If there
is access to individual bulks of NMOS transistors – ,
these bulks can be biased through the current-limiting resisters
.
The circuit parameters of the proposed 30-GHz VCO are
listed in Table I. In order to verify the derivations in (4) and (9)
around 30 GHz, the extracted values of and at 30 GHz
from full-wave electromagnetic (EM) simulation are 275 m
and 945 m . Based on simulation and from Fig. 7, the abso-
lute values of negative conductance for at 0.4-V and
at 0.3-nH are 1.6 mS and 5.736 mS, respec-
tively. This results in the 23.6-fF and 36.22-fF , and
the corresponding design parameters are

For selecting the gate voltage of the proposed Col-
pitts VCO with supply voltage V, the simulated
dc power consumption, oscillation frequency, tuning range,
phase noise, voltage swing , figure-of-merit (FOM), and
figure-of-merit including tuning range with respect
to the gate voltage are shown in Table II. From this table,
it is observed that the superior FOM and are achieved
at 1.6-V for this Colpitts VCO. Therefore, the V
is used for this work.
The bias conditions for the proposed VCO are V,
V, and V. From circuit simulation, the
bias voltage at gate of varactors is 0.72 V.
According to the 0.72-V gate bias of varactors, the controlled
voltage can be properly selected. The oscillation ampli-
tude of the previous published VCOs can be controlled by the
tail current [11], [19]. However, the tail current source is elimi-
nated to reduce the noise in this work. To control the oscil-
lation amplitude in this work, the gate bias of transistors
– is used to adjust the oscillation amplitude. From sim-
ulation, oscillation amplitude of can be adjusted from 415
mV to 920 mV by varying the from 1.1 V to 2.0 V. To con-
sider the startup with significant process variations, the Colpitts
VCO has been simulated at different process corners. The sim-
ulated results are summarized in Table III. As can be seen in
this table, this VCO can satisfy the requirements for startup and
operate at the slow, typical, and fast corners. Moreover, the gate
voltage of MOSFET – can also be raised to pro-
vide higher dc power consumption to overcome the significant
process variations.

oscillation frequency can be varied from 29.61 to 30.02 GHz
by adjusting the controlled voltage from 0 to 1.0 V, ex-
hibiting the 1.34% tuning range. While the supply voltage of
the proposed Colpitts VCO is raised to 1.5-V supply voltage
, the measured tuning range is increased to 1.7% and the
dc power consumption of the VCO core is 9.2 mW.
Fig. 20 shows the measured phase noise of this Colpitts VCO
with a 1.0-V supply voltage and 2.3-mW dc power consump-
tion. As can be seen from this figure, the measured phase noise
is dBc Hz at 1-MHz offset from the 30-GHz carrier.
When the supply voltage is raised to 1.5 V, the measured phase
noise can be improved to dBc Hz at 1-MHz offset from
the 30.5-GHz carrier. In addition, the measured phase noise
at 1-MHz offset across the tuning range with the VCO supply
voltage of 1.0 V is shown in Fig. 21. From this figure, it is found
that the phase noise is lower than dBc Hz within the en-
tire frequency range.

VCOs from the 20- to 30-GHz frequency band along with this
work. It is observed that this 30-GHz Colpitts VCO can achieve

a reduced supply voltage and minimized dc power consump-
tion while operating at the highest frequency. As for character-
izing the VCO performance, the widely used FOM [5], [41] and
figure-of-merit considering the tuning range [41] are
adopted in this work. The FOM and are written as
(41)

where is the VCO phase noise, is the offset fre-
quency, is the carrier frequency, and is the dc power
consumption. From Table V, it is clear that the proposed neg-
ative-conductance boosted differential Colpitts VCO has a su-
perior FOM and . In this paper, the inductor is
used for the cross-coupled pair ( – in Fig. 2) to increase
the negative conductance . The inductor in this
Colpitts VCO has small inductance nH . If higher
inductances are required for other cases, the inductors can be
implemented by using the on-chip miniature 3-D inductor to
minimize the chip area [42]. From Table V, it is also found that
the chip area of this wok is smaller that that of the other VCOs,
except [37].
For consideration of the tuning range of this Colpitts VCO,
the device size of MOSFET – is
m m, which has been minimized to reduce the para-
sitic capacitance . To further increase the tuning range,
it is possible to use a higher supply voltage , larger MOS
varactor , and negative tuning voltage . However,
these approaches will raise the dc power consumption and the
inconvenience of using the negative tuning voltage. For a VCO,
there is a tradeoff between the tuning range, supply voltage, dc
power consumption, and phase noise. From Table V, it is ob-
served that the tuning range of this VCO can be improved from
1.34% to 1.7% by raising the supply voltage .
For consideration of the supply voltage variation and sensi-
tivity, the measured VCO performances with respect to supply

1(a), the Vco core consists of a cross-coupled pair and an 
LC tank. The negative conductance (−Gm) initiates oscil-
lation at the fundamental frequency (fo) along with har-
monic components across the output of the cross-coupled 
pair. The output node is in the middle of the inductors, 
which functions as a virtual ground for differential-mode 
signal (fo) and an open circuit for common-mode second-
harmonic signal (2fo). Therefore, the out-of-phase funda-
mental signals (fo) cancel each other, whereas the in-phase 
second-harmonic signals (2fo) are added constructively. 
although this approach enhances the output frequency, 
the Vco tuning range is limited. Moreover, an rF choke, 
composed of a bypass capacitor and a one-quarter wave-
length (λ/4) microstrip or coplanar waveguide (cPW) 
line, is required to provide a dc current path and high im-
pedance at the frequency of 2fo. The λ/4 cPW line shown 
in Fig. 1(b) is implemented by using one signal line sur-
rounded by two adjacent grounded plates. The λ/4 cPW 
line in a silicon process for mm-wave application is typi-
cally several hundreds of micrometers in length, occupying 
a large chip area. Furthermore, it is difficult to fabricate 
the cPW line with a length exactly equal to one-quarter 
wavelength at the frequency of interest because of process 
variation. In addition, the λ/4 line is inherently a narrow-
band circuit, and it is hard to meet the requirement of a 
wide-tuning-range push-push Vco.
To overcome these difficulties, the Mos varactors 
(Cvar2–Cvar3) shown in Fig. 2 are connected between the 
drain and source terminations of the cross-coupled pair 
(M1–M2) to increase the Vco tuning range and improve 
the phase noise. In addition, a small-value capacitor (Cbuf) 
is inserted between the Vco core and buffer to allevi-
ate the output loading on the Vco core. The enhanced 
second-harmonic output signal (2fo) is directly extracted 
from the middle (Vpp) of the varactors. Thus, the λ/4 
cPW line is eliminated from this W-band push-push 
Vco, leading to a reduced chip size. The design consider-
ations of the proposed Vco shown in Fig. 2 are presented 
in the sections that follow.
A. MOSFET Device Size Consideration
In a typical Vco design, the cross-coupled pair is wide-
ly used to generate the negative conductance (−Gm) to 
compensate for losses of the LC tank. While operating in 
the mm-wave frequency band, Vcos often cannot meet 
the startup condition because of the degraded negative 
conductance.
To design the low-power low-phase-noise wide-tuning-
range push-push W-band Vco shown in Fig. 2, it is neces-
sary to consider the selection of device size for MosFET 
(M1–M2). Fig. 3 shows the simulated current-gain cut-off 
frequency (fT) and drain currents of the 0.18-μm n-chan-
nel MosFETs as a function of device width for various 
biases. as can be seen in Fig. 3, the fT can be enhanced 
by increasing the MosFET device width from 2 to 18 μm 
or by raising the drain and gate voltages (Vd and VG) of 
the MosFET. The maximum value of fT occurs at Vd = 
VG = 1.2 V. However, this raises the drain current. There-
fore, there are trade-offs between the current-gain cut-off 
frequency (fT), MosFET device width, and drain current.
Fig. 4 shows the simulated conductance (Gm) of the 
cross-coupled pair (M1–M2) with respect to different 0.18-
μm MosFET device width for various biases. as can be 
seen in Fig. 4, the negative conductance (−Gm) of the 
cross-coupled pair can be enhanced by increasing the de-

From (8), it is observed that the variation of Cvar1 has a 
greater influence on oscillation frequency (fo) than Cvar2,3 
does. as a result, the Mos varactor Cvar1 is implemented 
with larger device size than that of Cvar2,3 to increase the 
tuning range around fo.
Based on (8), the oscillation frequency (fo) of the push-
push Vco can be adjusted by altering the varactor ca-
pacitance from Cvar,min to Cvar,max. Thus, the Vco tuning 
range is written in the following form:

where Cvari,min and Cvari,max for i = 1 or 2, 3 represent 
the minimum and maximum capacitances of Cvar1 and 
Cvar2,3, respectively. For consideration of the capacitance 
ratio (Cvar1/Cvar2,3) of this W-band Vco, the simu-
lated tuning range of the 77-GHz push-push Vco with 
respect to capacitance ratio (Cvar1/Cvar2,3) is shown in 
Fig. 6. From this figure, it is observed that the tuning 
range can be increased by raising the capacitance ratio 
(Cvar1/Cvar2,3). Moreover, the simulated tuning range of 
the push-push Vco without varactor Cvar2,3 is also la-
beled in Fig. 6 for comparison. It is found that the tuning 
range of the proposed push-push Vco can be improved 
from that of the conventional push-push Vco without 
Cvar2,3. The optimum capacitance ratio (Cvar1/Cvar2,3) of 
the proposed push-push Vco is around 3.5, and the tun-
ing range is 9.19%. While increasing the capacitance ratio 
(Cvar1/Cvar2,3) to a very high value (Cvar1/Cvar2,3 = 8), 
the tuning range is slightly reduced from 9.19% to 8.25%, 
resulting in an small 0.94% tuning range reduction. To 
further increase the ratio, the tuning range is expected 
to shrink a little bit, but it will still be larger than that 
of the conventional push-push Vco without Cvar2,3. In 
addition, it will be difficult to implement a small Cvar2,3 
for a very large capacitance ratio (Cvar1/Cvar2,3) because 
of the process variation. Therefore, the optimum capaci-
tance ratio (Cvar1/Cvar2,3 = 3.5) is adopted in this work. 
Furthermore, the simulated tuning range of the W-band 
push-push Vco with Cvar1/Cvar2,3 = 3.5 and without the 
varactors (Cvar2, Cvar3) is shown in Fig. 7. It is clear that 
the tuning range can be improved from 2.63% to 9.19% 
because of the varactors connected between the source 
and drain terminations of the cross-coupled pair.
C. Phase Noise Consideration
according to leeson’s model [19], the phase noise of 
proposed 77-GHz Vco is mainly influenced by the LC-
tank, which consists of the on-chip inductors (Ld1 and Ls) 
and the varactors (Cvar1 and Cvar2,3).
For characterizing the phase noise of proposed 
push-push Vco affected by the capacitance ratio 
(Cvar1/Cvar2,3), the simulated phase noise at 1-MHz off-
Fig. 6. simulated tuning range of the 77-GHz push-push voltage-con-
trolled oscillator with respect to the capacitance ratio (Cvar1/Cvar2,3).
IEEE TransacTIons on UlTrasonIcs, FErroElEcTrIcs, and FrEqUEncy conTrol, vol. 58, no. 7, jUly 20111312
(Cvar2,3) provides capacitive feedback similar to that of a 
colpitts Vco. Therefore, the proposed push-push Vco 
features better cyclostationary noise in terms of phase 
noise, leading to the low phase noise performance.
D. Impedance Transformation at Fundamental Output 
Buffer
To drive a 50-Ω low input impedance of the instrument 
and alleviate the loading effects on the Vco core shown 
in Fig. 11, the device size of fundamental testing buffer 
is minimized to (W/L)4 = 12 μm/0.18 μm to reduce the 
parasitic effects. In addition, a small 24.7-fF Cbuf is in-
serted between the Vco core and the fundamental testing 
buffer to provide the impedance transformation.
according to the simulated results shown in Fig. 12, 
the imaginary part of the input impedance (i.e., parasitic 
capacitance) for the testing buffer can be reduced because 
of the counterclockwise direction from Zin,1 to Zin,2. The 
simulated magnitudes of the input impedances (Zin,1 and 
Zin,2) with respect to frequency are shown in Fig. 13. as

posed push-push voltage-controlled oscillator and the conventional push-

band, the inductors adopted in this push-push Vco are 
implemented on the 2-μm-thick top metal. To reduce the 
coupling effects between the inductors and the lossy sili-
con substrate, the shielding structure used in this work is 
constructed of a high-resistance mesh, as shown in Fig. 16. 
This mesh consists of rows and columns of resistors. The 
resistor type is a P-poly high-reflective-index (HrI) resis-
tor w/o salicide, and the sheet resistance is 1.1 kΩ/□ [23]. 
To characterize the shielding structure, the symmetric in-
ductor (Ld1) with and without high-resistance mesh are 
fabricated in a 0.18-μm cMos process. Fig. 17 shows the 
measured Q factor and inductance of the fabricated struc-
tures. To achieve the highest Q factor for the inductor 
(Ld1), the inductor width, resistor width, resistor length, 
and spacing between the parallel resistors have been taken 
into account by using a full-wave electromagnetic (EM) 
simulation. In this work, the optimum Q factor of the 
0.208-nH inductor (Ld1) is approximately 20 at 38.5 GHz, 
which is provided by the structure parameters of 14-μm 
wide inductor, 182-μm wide mesh, 118-μm long mesh, 
and 2 × 2 μm holes in the high-resistance mesh shielding 
structure.
The circuit parameters of the proposed W-band push-
push Vco are listed in Table I for clear illustration. To 
verify the derivations in (8) at around 38.5-GHz funda-
mental oscillation frequency, both extracted values of Ld1 
and Ls at 38.5 GHz are about 0.21 nH. The extracted 
resistances are Rd1 ≒ Rs = 2.5 Ω, and the extracted ca-
pacitance values are Cvar1 = 0.45 pF, Cvar2,3 = 0.13 pF. 
The transconductance gm1 of the MosFET M1 is 6 ma/V 
at 1.2 V Vdd and 1.2 V VG. This results in the following 
values: Ls(Cvar1 + Cvar2,3) = 1.218 × 10−22, Cvar2,3Ld1 = 
0.273 × 10−22, Cvar2,3Cvar1RsRd1 = 1.185 × 10−24, and 
gm2Cvar1(Ld1Rs + LsRd1) = 2.835 × 10−24, validating as-
sumptions (4) and (5) in the theoretical derivation.
To consider the startup with significant process varia-
tions, the W-band push-push Vco has been simulated at 
different process corners. The simulated results are sum-
marized in Table II. as can be seen in this table, this Vco 
with 1.2-V supply voltage (Vdd) can satisfy the require-
ments for startup and operate at the slow, typical, and 
fast corners. The oscillation frequency ranges from 71.89 
to 79.29 GHz, the tuning range ranges from 9.03 to 9.40%, 
and the phase noise at 1-MHz offset ranges from −92.56 
to −91.91 dBc/Hz.
To characterize the Vco performance affected by the 
mismatch between M1–M2, Cvar1, Cvar2, and Cvar3, the 
push-push Vco was simulated by using Monte carlo 
analysis. This analysis considers the random variations 
on Gaussian distribution of the process parameters, in-
cluding threshold voltage, channel length, channel width, 
and oxide thickness. These parameters are included in the 
device model provided by the foundry to account for the 
mismatch performance of threshold voltage (Vt) and satu-
rated drain current (Idsat). Fig. 18 shows the simulated 
phase noise at 1-MHz offset from the 77-GHz carrier by 
using Monte carlo analysis. There are a total of 50 sam-
pled data, and the phase noise discrepancies of these data 
are within 0.035 dB. Fig. 19 shows the simulated second-
harmonic output power (P2fo) at the 77-GHz carrier by 
using Monte carlo analysis. The maximum discrepancy of 
these 50 sampled data is 0.215 dB.

To predict the performance of fabricated Vco, the 
parasitic extraction of the layout has been performed by 
using full-wave electronic-magnetic (EM) simulation tools, 
sonnet (sonnet software Inc., north syracuse, ny) and 
HFss (ansys Inc., canonsburg, Pa). The simulated sec-
ond-harmonic frequency (2fo) before parasitic extraction 
of the layout is from 78.18 to 84.45 GHz. compared with 
the measured tuning range of 2fo shown in Fig. 22(a), it 
is found that there is an operation frequency reduction of 
approximately 6.0 GHz due to the layout parasitic.
Fig. 23 shows the measured output spectrum of the 
fundamental signal (fo) with 1.2-V supply voltage. It is 
observed that the measured phase noise is −96.78 dBc/
Hz at 1-MHz offset from the 38.18-GHz carrier. In addi-
tion, the measured output spectrum and phase noise of 
the second-harmonic output signal (2fo) are shown in Fig. 
24. It is found that the measured phase noise is −75 dBc/
Hz and −91.46 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz and 1-MHz offset from 
the 77.82-GHz carrier, respectively.
as for characterizing the Vco performance, the widely 
used figure of merit (FoM) and figure of merit including 
the tuning range (FoMT) [16] are adopted in this work.

cMos process. Using Mos varactors connected between 
drain and source terminations at the cross-coupled pair, 
this Vco can achieve a 6.35%-wide tuning range. The 
measured low phase noise is −75 dBc/Hz and −91.46 dBc/
Hz at 100-kHz and 1-MHz offset from the 77.8-GHz car-
rier, respectively. Moreover, a small capacitor is inserted 
between the Vco core and buffer to reduce loading ef-
fects. The second-harmonic signal (2fo) is extracted from 
the middle of the varactors, resulting in reduced chip size 
because of the elimination of an rF choke. Furthermore, 
the proposed high-resistance mesh shielding structure is 
inserted between the inductors and the lossy si-substrate 
to improve the inductor’s Q-factor. compared with other 
works, this push-push Vco demonstrates better FoM 
and FoMT. This fully integrated Vco also achieves the 
highest operation frequency among previously published 
0.18-μm cMos Vcos.

Abstract: In this paper, performance enhancement techniques for
CMOS power ampliﬁer (PA) are proposed. First, a small inductor is
inserted between the common-gate transistors of a triple-cascode stage
(PA unit) for improving the power-added eﬃciency (PAE). Moreover,
cross-coupled pairs are utilized in the PA circuit to raise the gain. Fur-
thermore, these additional cross-coupled transistors can boost the PAE
and saturated output power (Psat) of the PA. Based on these methods,
a K-band PA has been designed in 0.18-µm RF CMOS process. Simu-
lated results conﬁrm these methods applied to this PA can eﬀectively
improve the performance in terms of gain, Psat, and PAE.

2 Proposed PA
Fig. 1 shows the circuit schematic of the proposed power ampliﬁer. This
PA is designed in TSMC 0.18-µm RF CMOS process, which has six metal
layers and one poly layer. To deliver high output power for a power ampli-
ﬁer, the operating voltage can be increased to achieve this aim [3]. Hence,
a triple-cascode conﬁguration is adopted for a PA unit of the proposed
power ampliﬁer shown in Fig. 1. In addition, the triple-cascode topology
can provide high isolation between the RF input and RF output ports. The
device sizes of all the common-source and common-gate transistors of the
triple-cascode conﬁguration are the same, and the periphery of each PA
unit is 64 × 6µm. Therefore, the overall periphery combining four triple-
cascode PA units is 256 × 6µm. The circuit parameters of the PA unit
are: (W1/L1) = (W2/L2) = (W3/L3) = (W4/L4) = (W5/L5) = (W6/L6)
= 384µm/0.18µm, Vg1 = 1.0V, Vg2 = 2.0V, Vg3 = 3.0V, VDD = 5.4V,
and Lind = 0.02 nH. However, the MOSFETs with large device size also sub-
stantially contain the parasitic capacitance (Cpara), as shown in Fig. 2 (a).
Therefore, the power gain (Ap), power-added eﬃciency (PAE), and band-
width will be limited due to the parasitic capacitance.
To overcome this diﬃculty, a small inductor (Lind) shown in Fig. 2 (b) is
inserted to the triple-cascode PA unit for resonating the parasitic capacitance
(Cpara). By using the series-peaking inductor (Lind), the gain (Ap) of the
power ampliﬁer can be increased. For a conventional PA, the power-added

without and with a inductor (Lind) for the triple-cascode PA unit at 24GHz.
It is observed that the maximum PAE can be increased from 22.97% to
24.94% by adding the Lind.
For a PA operating around 60GHz, it is suitable to use transmission
line to overcome the substrate loss and increase the output power, rather
than using an inductor. In this work, a small inductor inserted between the
MOSFETs of triple-cascode PA is used to boost the PAE.
To further boost the gain and PAE, the cross-coupled pairs are utilized
in this proposed PA. Fig. 2 (e) shows the simpliﬁed model of the half circuit
for the proposed PA. The parasitic capacitances are ignored during the fun-
damental analysis procedure. For a conventional triple-cascode PA without
the cross-coupled pair, the output voltage V +out can be represented by
V +out = −gm3Vgs3 · sLd = −gm2Vgs2 · sLd
= −gm1Vgs1 · sLd = −gm1V −in · sLd
(3)
For the proposed PA with the cross-coupled pairs, the output voltage V +out in
Fig. 2 (e) can be derived as
V +out = −gm3Vgs3 · sLd = −(gm2Vgs2 + gm7Vgs7) · sLd
= −(gm1Vgs1 + gm7Vgs7) · sLd = −(gm1V −in + gm7Vgs7) · sLd
(4)
From (3) and (4), it is observed that the output voltage V +out can be eﬀec-
tively increased due to the MOSFET M7 of the cross-coupled pair. Therefore,
this can lead to an overall gain enhancement of the power ampliﬁer. Accord-
ing to (2), the power-added eﬃciency can also be enlarged due to the raised
gain.

8.6%. Moreover, cross-coupled pairs are adopted in the PA circuit. This can
not only improve the power gain from 7.5 dB to 10.4 dB, but also boost the
saturated output power (Psat) to 24.4 dBm and output 1-dB compression
point (OP1 dB) to 21.3 dBm. These proposed methods are veriﬁed by the
K-band CMOS PA, which has been designed by using TSMC 0.18-µm RF
CMOS process. According to the simulation results, the power performances
of this work are superior to that of recently published CMOS PAs [3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8].

1 Introduction
Due to the ability of high data-rate transmission in K-band, researches around
K-band were reported [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. When operating at tens of giga-
hertz frequencies, the regular cross-coupled VCOs have to raise the supply
voltage, dc power dissipation, and MOSFET device sizes to meet the startup
conditions. For overcoming these diﬃculties, a PMOS cross-coupled pair with
a capacitive feedback had been used to increase the output voltage swings,
leading to an improved phase noise [3]. However, the required supply voltage
of the VCO is 1.8V due to a low transconductance of p-channel MOSFET in
K band. In addition, the tuning range of the VCO in [3] is limited because of
the tradeoﬀ between phase noise and tuning range. In this work, the CMOS
VCO with varactors connected between drain and source terminations of the
cross-coupled pair achieves the 2.28-mW dc power consumption at 0.6-V sup-
ply voltage, while the phase noise is −112.53 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz oﬀset from
24.68-GHz carrier. Under this bias condition, the measured tuning range is
18.2%.
2 Proposed VCO
For VCOs operating in K band, there is always a tradeoﬀ between phase noise
and tuning range. In order to overcome this limitation, accumulation MOS
varactors (AMOS) with high quality factor (Q factor) are proposed to be
deposited between drain and source terminations of the VCO cross-coupled
pair, as shown in Fig. 1. The varactors (Cvar2 and Cvar3) provide an addi-
tional tuning mechanism for extending the VCO tuning range. Moreover, the
varactors (Cvar2 and Cvar3) form a capacitive feedback to boost the voltage
swing, leading to an improved phase noise.
The simpliﬁed equivalent half-circuit model of the proposed VCO is de-
picted in Fig. 2 (a), where RD1 and RS represent the losses of the on-chip
inductors LD1 and LS , respectively. To derive the operation frequency and
investigate the tuning mechanism, the transfer function between Vo and Vi

VCO Circuit design 
 
The circuit topology of a conventional LC-tank 
cross-coupled differential VCO is shown in Fig. 3. This 
VCO consists of a cross-coupled pair for negative 
conductance generation and LC resonator for frequency 
determination. For operating in X band, this VCO requires 
a high supply voltage and increased dc power for 
sustaining the oscillation. In order to overcome these 
difficulties, a low-voltage low-power dual resonance 
high-performance X-band CMOS VCO is illustrated in 
Fig. 4. For operating in low supply voltage, the tail current 
transistor is replaced by an inductor. It is not only can 
reduce the supply voltage, but also can increase the output 
voltage swing and reduce phase noise [11]. For low 
dc-power dissipation, the forward-body bias (VB) is used 
to reduce the MOSFET threshold voltage for low-voltage 
and low-power operation. The threshold voltage formula 
can be written as 
 
]22[ FSBFtot VVV φφγ −++=     (7) 
 
where Vt0 is the threshold voltage at VBS=0, γ is a process 
parameter which is typical between 0.3 and 0.4, andψf is 
the physical parameter [12]-[13].
