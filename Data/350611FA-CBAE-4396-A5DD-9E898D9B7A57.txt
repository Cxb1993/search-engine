1. Introduction
The textile industry is one of those industries that consume considerable amounts of
wastewater in the manufacturing process [1]. Azo-dye and chromium (VI) compounds are of
widespread use in many textile industries. As a result, these compounds are commonly
encountered in industrial effluents and surface water [2]. Because of their toxicity to human and
marine life, increasingly stringent restrictions have been imposed on the concentrations of these
compounds in the wastewater for safe discharge [3]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
reactive red 120 (RR 120) and chromium (VI) can be effectively removed by bacterial consortium
[4,5]. Chromium is found in the environment predominantly as Cr(VI) and Cr(III). Cr(VI) is
classified by the US EPA as a group a carcinogen based on its chronic and subchronic effects [6].
Effects of chronic exposure to hexavalent chromium include dermatitis, skin ulceration, and
chromosome aberrations. Cr(III) is more stable and is approximately 1000 times less toxic than
Cr(VI) [7]. Cr(VI) reduction by Desulfovibrio vulgaris has been demonstrated using molecular H2
as an electron donor [8]. The objective of this study is to conduct a batch kinetic tests using
chitosan as attached beads to degrade reactive red 120 and Cr(VI) simultaneously and develop a
model system to verify the batch bioreactor performance. In attition, a continuous flow column
test was setup and conducted to verified the model system for simultaneous removal of RR 120
and Cr(VI) in biological chitosan beads (BCB) reactor.
2. Model development
Fig. 1 shows the conceptual basis of a biological chitosan bead. To model the kinetics of
reactive red 120 degradation with chromium(VI) reduction in bio-chitosan reactor, the following
6(per liter) [5]: Na2HPO4, 3.6 g; (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g; KH2PO4, 1.0 g; MgSO4, 1.0 g; Fe(NH4) citrate,
0.01 g; CaCl2·2H2O, 0.1 g; and 10.0 ml of trace element solution per liter was used for all the
studies. The trace element solution used was of following composition (per liter):ZnSO4·7H2O,
10.0 mg; MnCl2·4H2O, 3.0 mg; CoCl2·6H2O, 1.0 mg; NiCl2·6H2O, 2.0 mg; Na2MoO4·2H2O, 3.0
mg; H3BO3, 30.0 mg; CuCl2·2H2O, 1.0 mg. The final pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.0. The
MSM was supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) of yeast extract and glucose. The yeast extract, glucose
and azo-dye were added to sterilized MSM from their respective filter sterilized stock solutions.
Cultivation of Cr(VI)-reducing E. coli
E. coli ATCC 33456 was originally purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and
has been in our laboratory collection since 2006. E. coli were harvested during the log growth
phase in nutrient broth after incubation at 35℃ for 24 h. The consortium culture used in all
experiments was prepared by washing the harvested E. coli cells three times in 0.85% NaCl
solution and then resuspended, together with phenol-utilizing cells obtained through gradient
centrifugation described above, in a modified basal mineral medium supplemented with trace
metal and vitamin solutions. The mineral salt medium for consortium culture contained (per liter)
[12] NH4Cl, 1.013 g; NaH2PO4‧2H2O, 0.62 g; K2HPO4, 2.5 g; MgSO4‧7H2O, 0.0103 g;
CaCl2‧2H2O, 0.00425 g; FeCl3‧3H2O 0.00085 g. The trace metal stock solution (g/l) FeCl3‧
6H2O, 0.243 g; MnCl2‧2H2O 0.06 g; ZnCl2, 0.041 g; CuCl2‧2H2O 0.036 g; CoCl2‧2H2O, 0.036
g; Na2B4O7‧10H2O, 0.015 g; Na3-Citrate, 2.205 g; (NH4)6Mo7O27‧4H2O, 0.026 g; KH2PO4,
5.104g; NaH2PO4‧H2O, 3.105 g; (NH4)2SO4, 1.980 g; NH4Cl, 18.450 g; CaCl2‧2H2O;
MgCl2‧6H2O; 3.049 g; NiCl2‧6H2O, 0.025 g; and 5 ml of a trace vitamin B12 stock solution.
Analytical methods
Reactive Red 120 was measured using UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model
UV-1700) at 530 nm [5]. The uninoculated dye free medium was used as blank. All assays were
performed in duplicate and compared with uninoculated controls. Cr(VI) was determined by
colorimetric method using UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model UV-1700) at 540 nm by
reaction with sdiphenyl-carbazide [13].
Bioreactor setup
A laboratory-scale batch bio-chitosan reactor was setup and conducted using reactive red 120
and Cr(VI) as substrates. The reactor consisted of inner column and outer column. The size of
inner column was 22 cm high and 5 cm diameter. The outer column was 25 cm high and 13 cm
diameter. The volume of aqueous solution in the bioreactor is 254 ml which yields a hydraulic
retention time of 14.2 h. The chitosan SEM is shown in Fig.2. As can be seen in Fig. 2, it shows
chitosan has enough roughness for biomass attachment. The schematic diagram of biologica
chitosan bead reactor for continuous flow column tests is shown in Fig. 3. The bioreactor
8performance of the biological chitosan beads system for Cr(VI) bioreduction can be described by
four parts. First, the Cr(VI) concentration increased steadily up to about 2.0 mg/L (0.413 Sb0) at
27 days. During this period, E. coli growth inside the reactor for Cr(VI) bioreduction were not
significant. The reactor was behaving similar to a chitosan adsorber, and the Cr(VI) effluent
concentration curve was the same as a typical breakthrough curve of chitosan adsorber. At this
stage, chitosan bead was adsorbing Cr(VI) without significant resistance to the diffusion of the
Cr(VI) posed by the attached E. coli cells.
The second part of Cr(VI) bioreduction curve ran from 27 to 58 days, when the Cr(VI) curve
started to deviate from the breakthrough curve of chitosan adsorber. The Cr(VI) effluent
concentration leveled off and then began to decrease. Both phenomena confirm the active
reduction of Cr(VI) by attached E. coli cells and that biofilm was growing significantly during the
second period. The third part of the Cr(VI) curve ran from 58 to 100 days. The Cr(VI)
concentration maintained a constant level which represented the steady-state condition. The fourth
part of the Cr(VI) concentration curve ran from 100 days until termination of the test. The Cr(VI)
concentration reached a steady-state level, which was equivalent to about 84% removal.
4.3. Growth of S. majuscule and E. coli cells
Fig.6 presents the growth curve of attached S. majuscula cells and E. coli cells varied with
time by model prediction. The growth curve of attached S. majuscula cells shows a similar pattern
to attached E. coli cells. The elapsed time required for attached cells to start to growth is about 10
days. The attached S. majuscula and E. coli cells vigorously grew to biodegraded RR 120 and
reduce Cr(VI) from 10 days to 60 days. At a steady-state condition, the maximum growth
thickness of attached S. majuscula and E. coli cells reached up to 170 and 150μm, respectively.
Fig. 7 shows the growth curves of suspended S. majuscula and E. coli cells varied with time.
One indicator of the increased S. majuscula and E. coli cells growth was the concentration of
suspended S. majuscula and E. coli cells in the effluent. The general trend of the effluent of
suspended S. majuscula and E. coli concentrations in model simulation were similar to the
experimental results. Fig. 7(a) shows that there was no significant reduction of RR 120 by
suspended S. majuscula cells for the first 10 days. The growth rate of suspended S. majuscula
cells rapidly increased at a transient-state condition from 10 to 60 days. At this period, the
suspended S. majuscula cells degraded RR 120 for their growth. Since the amount of RR 120
available during bioregeneration was higher than after bioregeneration, the growth rate of
suspended S. majuscula cells during this period should have been higher than that at the steady
state level. The growth curve of suspended S. majuscula cells showed a peak at 60 days during
bioregeneration. The concentration of suspended S. majuscula cells in the effluent was around 1.2
mg RR120/L at a maximum growth.
Fig. 7(b) shows the growth curves of suspended E. coli cells varied with time. One indicator
of the increased E. coli cells growth was the concentration of suspended E. coli cells in the
10
approached a constant value equal to 6.3×10-3 mg/cm2-d. The curves showed that Cr(VI)
reduction by biofilm became the dominant mechanism responsible for the steady-state removal of
the Cr(VI) in the BCB process.
4.5. RR 120 and Cr(VI) removal by model prediction
The RR 120 and Cr(VI) removed by the entire system was the summation of the Cr(VI)
removed by the biofilm and the chitosan beads. Fig. 9 shows the amount of RR 120 and Cr(VI)
removed by the entire system, chitosan beasds and biofilm in a BCB process. Since RR 120 and
Cr(VI) removed by adsorption does not change its chemical structure, the amount of Cr(VI)
removed by the chitosan beads also equals the amount of the Cr(VI) that remains adsorbed in the
chitosan beads.
The amount of RR 120 and Cr(VI) removed by the entire system was equal to Cr(VI)
adsorbed by chitosan beads up to 12 days. S. majuscula and E. coli biofilm utilized almost no RR
120 and Cr(VI), respectively, because the amount of the S. majuscula and E. coli cells were not
significant up to this time. As the S. majuscula and E. coli biofilm started to grow actively after 12
days, RR 120 and Cr(VI) removal by S. majuscula and E. coli biofilm increased and that adsorbed
by the chitosan bead leveled-off. The amount of RR 120 and Cr(VI) adsorbed by chitosan beads
decreased after 33 days due to bioregeneration. The amount of the Cr(VI) that remained adsorbed
was decreasing very slowly as the process approached steady state. As a result, the chitosan bead
was only acting essentially as an inert supporting medium for S. majuscula and E. coli bioiflm
growth at steady state, respectively.
5. Conclusion
In this study, the kinetic biological chitosan bead models for adsorption and biodegradation of
azo-dye and Cr(VI) in batch and continuous flow biological chitosan bead process were
developed and verified by conducting a batch and continuous flow laboratory-scale biological
chitosan bead reactor. The biological chitosan bead reactor was capable of achieving high
simultaneous removal of azo-dye and Cr(VI) when phenol and Cr(VI) was subjected to the feed
concentration of 20 mg RR 120/L and 5 mg Cr(VI)/L, respectively. A combination of orthogonal
colocation method and Gear’s method was most suitable to solve the biological chitosan bead
models in batch and continuous flow kinetic tests. The models were able to predict the biological
chitosan bead reactor performance in a batch and continuous flow column test. The approaches
applied in this study could be expand to design a pilot-scale or full-scale biological chitosan bead
reactors to remove azo-dye and chromium (VI) in the industrial textile wastewater.

when well acclimated, can only accommodate low concentrations of phenolic compounds,
typically less than 100 mg/L, due to low biodegradability (Lin & Wang 2002). In addition,
phenolic wastewater with high phenol concentration (10000 mg/L or more) has been treated using
physical-chemical (Zilli et al. 1993) or biological techniques (Buitrón et al. 1998). However,
these treatments are highly complex and expensive (Lin & Wang 2002). This has driven the
development of new technologies for treating phenolic wastewater, particularly technologies that
produce small amounts of waste sludge (González et al. 2001).
The application of a biodegradation process using a mixed supported media to attach
microorganisms that are specially adapted to metabolize phenolic wastewater is an alternative to
conventional treatment processes. The aim of this work was to assess the performance of a
fixed-biofilm process using a polyurethane foam sponge cube with plastic Ballast® rings to attach
microorganisms to treat phenolic wastewater and meet the discharge requirement for wastewater
from petrochemical and oil refining industries.
This study are intended to (1) determine the biokinetic parameters using batch kinetic tests for
model simulation; (2) evaluate phenol degradation by suspended and attached biomasses in a
fixed biofilm reactor; (3) evaluate the growth of biofilm and suspended biomass in a fixed-biofilm
reactor; (4) determine the phenol flux into the biofilm and phenol concentration profile in the
biofilm; and (5) compare the experimental and modeling results for phenol effluent concentration
in a fixed-biofilm reactor.
MODEL DEVELOPMENT
Conceptual basis of biofilm
The bacteria accumulation in biofilms or aggregates can result in the development of
microenvironments due to diffusional resistance of a substrate within the biofilm (Lens et al.,
1995). Figure 1 shows the hypothetical cross-sectional structure of a biofilm on an inert medium.
Figure 2 presents the hypothetical concentration profile within a biofilm. The substrate
concentration profile can be determined within the biofilm and bulk liquid phase by imposing
approximate boundary conditions and initial conditions.

thickness must increase over time as the biofilm grows. Therefore, the phenol diffuses through a
boundary that can be moving with time. This boundary is liquid/biofilm interface. Since the
biofilm grows by utilizing phenol, the biofilm growth rate and initial condition can be expressed
by the following equations:

where Lf is biofilm thickness (L), Y the yield coefficient of the biomass (MxMs-1), kd is the decay
coefficient of biomass (T-1), bs the biofilm shear-loss coefficient (T-1), and Lf0 is initial biofilm
thickness (L). The initial biofilm thickness must be set to a small value such that the biofilm can
start growing.
Substrate and suspended biomass balance in the bioreactor
A fixed-biofilm reactor in which the kinetic biofilm model can be applied is a completely mixed
biofilm reactor. All of the suspended biomass at the liquid/biofilm interface is exposed to the
same phenol concentration (Chang & Rittmann, 1987). The substrate disappeared from the bulk
liquid as it migrated into the liquid/biofilm interface. The suspended biomass starts growing due
to substrate biodegradation. The mass balance of phenol and the suspended biomass in a
fixed-biofilm reactor can be described by

Model solution technique

Supporting media
To verify the mathematical model, a polyurethane foam sponge cube (2ⅹ2ⅹ2 cm) was chosen as
the biomass support medium due to its high surface area for biomass accumulation. The Plastic
Ballast ring (Century Plastics, Inc., El Dorado, Kansas) was chosen as the media to avoid
plugging problems and maintain a uniform distribution of influent and air flow. The Plastic
Ballast ring was 1.58 cm in diameter and height and surface area was 3.54 cm2/cm3.
Analytical methods
Phenol was determined by 1:1 extraction with CH2Cl2. An extract of 1 µL was subsequently
injected into a gas chromatograph (model 5890, Hewlett Packard Instrument Co., Colorado, USA)
equipped with a flame ionization detector FID detector and a GP80/100 Carbopack capillary
column (Nkhalambayausi-Chirwa and Wang 2001). Liquid samples were filtered through a
0.45-m membrane filter to remove the suspended biomass prior to analysis. The membrane fiber
method was employed to measure the volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the samples. This
method is described in Section 2540 E of Standard Methods (2005).
Fixed biofilm reactor configuration
The fixed-biofilm column reactor with a high recycle flow rate (Qr/Q = 25) to maintain a
completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was used to treat phenol. Three runs of continuous feed
experiments were performed to investigate the phenol biodegradation by biofilm and the
suspended biomass in the fixed-biofilm reactor. The reactor was fed phenolic wastewater at 3.56,
2.37 and 1.78 L/day. The effective reactor volume is 1.78 L, which yields a hydraulic retention
times (HRTs) of 12, 18 and 24 h, respectively. The dissolved oxygen was measured and
maintained at 5.9–6.8 mg/L. The reactor was placed in the room at 28.5℃. Figure 3 shows the
experimental system.

then decreased. The biofilm was vigorously utilizing phenol during this period. The biofilm was
also actively growing during this period.
The third part of the phenol concentration curve was for the period 13–40 days. At this period, the
system had reached a steady state condition and the phenol concentration in effluent was about 4
mg/L (0.06 Sb0) for an HRT of 12 h, 3 mg/L (0.041 Sb0) for an HRT of 18 h, and 2.5 mg/L (0.035
Sb0) for an HRT of 24 h. The removal efficiency for phenol was 94–96.5% at different HRTs.
Experimental data was slightly higher than simulation results for the phenol concentration in
effluent at this period. One reason was phenol-degrading bacteria grew enough to form a biofilm.
Thus, the effect of shear loss increased as the biofilm thickened. The high shear loss of biofilm
resulted in high suspended biomass caused from biofilm. The suspended biomass decomposed
and released soluble microbial products (SMPs) that slightly increased phenol concentration in
effluent (Namkung & Rittmann 1986). Moreover, the short HRT caused the dilute-in curve to
increase steeper and reach a higher peak than long HRT. At a steady state, the phenol removal
efficiency increased as the HRT increased. Notably, a short HRT caused a higher organic loading
rate than long HRT, which reduced phenol removal efficiency.
Growth of suspended biomass
Figure 4(b) plots the growth curves of suspended biomasses. One indicator of the generating
biomass growth was the suspended biomass concentration in the effluent. Good agreement existed
between model simulation data and experimental data for suspended biomass growth in the
fixed-biofilm reactor. The suspended biomass utilized a considerable amount of phenol for
growth during the first 13 days. The growth curve of the suspended biomass reached a steady
state condition at 13–40 days. The suspended biomass concentration in effluent was about 76-79
mg VSS/L at maximum growth for different HRTs. Maximum growth of the suspended biomass
remained roughly the same at different HRTs.
Biofilm growth
Figure 4(c) presents the biofilm growth curve by model simulation. About 2 days are required for
the biofilm to start growing. The model predicted that the biofilm grew vigorously to utilize
phenol at a transient-state period of 2-15 days. The biofilm growth peaked at 428 µm for an HRT
of 12 h, 289 µm for an HRT of 18 h and 217 µm for an HRT of 24 h under a steady state
condition. The biofilm growth increased as HRT decreased. A short HRT resulted in high flow
rate increasing the biofilm encounter substrate, which resulted in rapid biofilm growth.
Flux into biofilm
Figure 4(d) presents the model-predicted flux of phenol at different HRTs. At the start of the test,
no significant phenol flux into the biofilm during the first 2 days as the biofilm growth was
34
and 35 days, respectively. No difference existed in the morphology of biomass at 7 and 35 days;
however, the amount of biomass at 35 days was greater than that at 7 days. The reactor system
was in an exponential growth phase for the biomass at 7 days then reached a constant growth
phase for biomass at 35 days.
Figure 5 Transmission electron microscope identified the spatial distribution of the biomass
trapped in the net of a polyurethane foam sponge cube at different operating times for an HRT of
12 h for (a) 7 days and (b) 35 days.
Microbial distribution on support medium
Figure 6 presents TEM photographs of the biomass distributed on polyurethane foam sponge cube
in the fixed-biofilm reactor at an operating time of 25 days for an HRT of 18 h. Most of the
biomass was firmly attached to polyurethane foam sponge cube; however, some of the attached
biomass dropped into the bulk liquid phase due to shear loss caused by wastewater flow. This
observation demonstrates that shear loss of biofilm increases the amount of suspended biomass in
bulk liquid phase.
Figure 6 Transmission electron microscope demonstrated that the biofilm accumulated on the
supporting medium and some biofilm became a suspended biomass due to shear loss.

Samples
Wastewater samples were collected from two different food processing plants including
fructose-processing and sugar-processing units that are known to be high in COD. Samples were
taken from the same location at two different times of the day, in order to obtain a range of
sample types present at the facility. In fructose-processing or sugar-processing units, water used
in the preparation of fructose or molasses products at several locations in the plant is collected at
this site then discharged into a central line. The central line was sampled during one of two
normal production shifts as well as during a late-night shift primarily oriented around cleaning
operations.
Seed Inoculums
The seed sludge used for determining the optimal initial cultivation pH and temperature was
selected from anaerobic sludge in fructose wastewater treatment plant. After being collected from
treatment plant, anaerobic sludge was screened with sieve No. 8 (diameter 2.35 mm) to eliminate
large particulate materials [10]. Before being seeded into the bioreactors the screened sludge was
heat-treated at 100°C for 2h to inhibit methane-producing bacteria activity and selected as
heat-resistant, hydrogen-producing, and spore-forming bacteria [10].
Bioreactor and Nutrient Solution
The batch experiments were carried out with a working volume of 5 l stirred-tank bioreactor
(Figure 1) seeded with 600 ml heat-pretreated sludge and fed with 2500 ml substrate solution and
1900 ml nutrient solution. The hydrogen-producing bioreactor was gassed with nitrogen gas to
remove dissolved oxygen and the headspace of the reactor to keep an anaerobic environment. The
temperature of bioreactor was controlled at 55±1℃ and operated in an rotated shaft with a
rotation speed of 90 rpm to provide better contact between substrates and nutrient solution. Each
liter of nutrient stock solution contained 1 g of resazurin; 26.7 g of (NH4)2HPO4; 16.7 g of
CaCl2‧2H2O; 26.6 g of NH4Cl; 120 g of MgCl2‧6H2O; 86.7 g of KCl; 1.33 g of MnCl2‧4H2O;
2 g of CoCl2‧6H2O; 0.38 g of H3BO3; 0.18 g of CuCl2‧2H2O; 0.17 g of Na2MoO4‧2H2O;
0.14 g of ZnCl2; 370 g of FeCl2‧4H2O; 500 g of C2H3NaO2S; 0.002 g of Biotin; 0.002 g of Folic
acid; 0.01 g of Pyridoxine HCl; 0.005 g of Ribotlavin; 0.005 g of Thiamin; 0.005 g of Pantothenic
acid; 0.005 g of Nicotinic acid. The fructose wastewater and molasses wastewater were obtained
from Fonen Sugar Refinery and Taiwan Sugar industry, respectively. The raw material for
fructose and molasses of these two factories is starch and sugarcane, respectively. The fructose
and molasses wastewater was pretreated by keeping -40C for 24 h, and then the wastewater was
filtered through cheese-cloth to remove precipitate. The filtrate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
30 min, and then filtered through 0.45μm Whatmann filter paper [11]. After adjusting the pH by
adding few drops of concentrated HCl or NaOH solution to the desired initial levels, the
wastewater was sterilized by autoclaving and stored at -40C.

applied. The maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPRm) was determined by dividing
Rm by volatile suspended solids (VSS) added. Hydrogen conversion efficiency for fructose and
molasses wastewater was compared based on the values of SHPP and SHPRm.
3. Results and Discussion
Effect of Initial pH
Table 1 summarizes the experimental results obtained from fructose wastewater at various initial
cultivation pH values during 120 h hydrogen fermentation. Since the initial ORP and alkalinity
values in a stirred tank reactor were in the ranges favoring hydrogen production for fructose
wastewater [1,14]. Therefore, the differences in hydrogen production would be considered as a
result of varied initial pH. A pH value of 6 was reported optimal for mixed culture to produce the
highest hydrogen amount (210 ml) with the greatest hydrogen content (42%). Table 2 reveals the
hydrogen production from molasses wastewater at various initial pHs during 120 h hydrogen
fermentation. The hydrogen productions at the end of fermentation ranged from 129236 ml and
were dependent on initial cultivation pH. The variation of hydrogen production and hydrogen
content with initial pH was the same as fructose wastewater. At initial pH 6, the highest hydrogen
amount was about 236 ml while hydrogen content achieved a greatest value of 52%.

higher hydrogen production potential for molasses than fructose wastewater. The variation of
maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPRm) with initial pH is presented in Figure 3(b).
The results showed that the maximum specific hydrogen production rate occurred at initial pH 6
for fructose and molasses wastewater. The peak value of SHPRm was 26.7 ml-H2/g-VSS-h and
42.7 ml-H2/g-VSS-h, respectively, for fructose and molasses wastewater.

wastewater (a) SHPP (b) SHPRm
Intermediate Products and Its Effect
Hydrogen production is usually accompanied by volatile fatty acids production coupled with
solvent production. The production of these intermediates reflects changes in the metabolic
pathway of the microorganisms involved and a better knowledge of such changes could improve
our understanding of the conditions favorable for hydrogen production. Thus, during the course of
hydrogen production, liquid samples were collected and analyzed for VFAs in the batch tests.
The major VFAs detected in the fermentation process were acetate, propionate and butyrate.
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) present the hydrogen production, hydrogen content, pH and VFAs
production profiles for glucose wastewater and molasses wastewater respectively. These results
were obtained from stirred-tank bioreactor with an initial pH of 6.0. A gradual production of acids
depleted the buffering capacity that resulted in a concomitant decline in pH to about 5.0 for
fructose wastewater and 4.6 for molasses wastewater before hydrogen production began. This was
followed by a rapid production of hydrogen with an increase in VFAs production until hydrogen
production achieved a maximum value of 210 ml for fructose wastewater and 236 for molasses
wastewater. The hydrogen content in the biogas reached a maximum value of 43% for fructose
wastewater and 52% for molasses wastewater as maximum hydrogen production was attained. In
stationary phase, the productions of acetate and butyrate decreased but an increase in propionate
was noticed. The butyrate concentration dramatically increased after 72 h, however, acetate and
propionate did not show marked changes in stationary phase for fructose wastewater. In addition,
butyrate has the highest concentration in the stationary phase for molasses wastewater. The lowest
propionate concentration was observed for both fructose and molasses wastewater at initial pH 6.

molasses wastewater was independent of the initial pH, the maximum HBu/HAc ratio for fructose
wastewater increased with initial pH 46 then decreased with initial pH 6-8. The HBu/HAc ratio
was found in the range of 1.43.1 for fructose wastewater and 1.42.3 for molasses wastewater.

ABSTRACT
This work presents a mathematical model to describe the biodegradation of phenolic wastewater
in a fixed-biofilm process. The model incorporates diffusive mass transport and Haldane kinetics
mechanisms. The model was solved using a combination of the orthogonal collocation method
and Gear’s method. A laboratory-scale column reactor was employed to verify the model. Batch
kinetic tests were conducted independently to determine biokinetic parameters for the model
simulation with the initial biofilm thickness assumed. The model simulated the phenol effluent
concentration results well. Removal efficiency for phenol was approximately 94–96.5% for
different hydraulic retention times at a steady-state condition. Model simulations results are in
agreement with experimental results. The approaches of model and experiments presented in this
paper could be used to design a pilot-scale or full-scale fixed-biofilm reactor system for the
biodegradation of phenolic wastewater from petrochemical and oil refining plants.

INTRODUCTION
Use of phenol and phenolic compounds is widespread in many industries, such as polymeric resin
production and oil refining (González et al. 2001). Thus, these compounds are common in
industrial effluent and surface water (Wang & Loh 1999). As these compounds are toxic to
humans and aquatic life, increasingly stringent restrictions have been imposed on effluent
concentrations of these compounds in wastewater treatment. In Taiwan, for instance, the phenol
concentration in treated industrial wastewater for safe discharge has been reduced from 2 to 1
mg/L due to health consideration. Hence, treating industrial wastewater containing phenolic
compounds is necessary (Lin & Wang 2002).
Phenolic wastewater has generally been treated using an activated sludge process as its simplicity
and relatively low cost. However, the suspended biomass in an activated sludge process, even
4Fixed-biofilm model assumptions
To model the kinetics of phenol degradation in a fixed biofilm process, we assume the following:
(1) a stagnant layer covers the biofilm; (2) substrate concentration within the biofilm vary only in
the direction normal to the biofilm surface; (3) the substrate is transported from bulk liquid to the
biofilm phase through the stagnant liquid layer by molecular diffusion; (4) biofilm growth does
not effect the liquid flow pattern in the reactor; and (5) shear loss of biofilm increases the amount
of suspended biomass in bulk liquid phase. These assumptions are similar as those made by
Suidan & Wang (1985) and Williamson & McCarty (1976). Since phenol is an only
growth-limiting substrate and all other nutrients exist in excess amounts and sufficient oxygen is
supplied (Chang & Rittmann 1987; Hirata et al. 1998), the phenol utilization rate in the biofilm,
based on difusion (Fick’s law) and a biological inhibition reaction (Haldane kinetics), can be
expressed as (Jih & Huang 1994; Wen et al. 1994)

Biofilm growth
As phenol diffuses into and through the biofilm during biodegradation, the biofilm utilizes phenol
as a carbon source for biosynthesis and respiration. The biomass in the biofilm can increase or
decrease over time until the growth rate is balanced by the decay rate and shear loss rate (Chang
& Rittmann 1987). Since biofilm density is assumed constant, the biofilm volume and biofilm
6Equations (1)-(10) constitute a fixed-biofilm model for phenol biodegradation in a completely
mixed flow reactor. Equations (1)-(10) were solved using a combination of the orthogonal
collocation method (OCM) and Gear’s method. The first step in model solution was
normalization of the biofilm domain by defining dimensionless variables. The second step in
model solution was selection of an orthogonal polynomial to approximate the phenol
concentration profile in the biofilm. The one partial differential equation with three ordinary
differential equations can be simplified and converted into dimensionless forms by defining the
dimensionless variables. The Legendre polynomials (an even function) in planar geometry were
used to approximate the exact phenol concentration profile in the biofilm. The roots of Lengendre
polynomials were used as the collocation points. The number of internal collocation points in the
biofilm was fixed at 6. The partial differential equation in the dimensionless form can be
transformed into six ordinary differential equations using the OCM. The entire model system,
including nine ordinary differential equations, was solved using Gear’s method to determine the 
phenol concentration profile in the biofilm, biofilm growth, effluent concentration of phenol in
bulk liquid and the effluent concentration of suspended biomass in bulk liquid.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial innoculum
The wastewater treatment process at the Ta-Lin Refinery, Chinese Petroleum Corporation
(Kaohsiung, Taiwan), comprises dissolved-air flotation, flow equalization, contact stabilization
and sedimentation units. The phenolic wastewater used in the laboratory-scale column test was
obtained from the effluent of flow equalization unit in the wastewater treatment plant. The
bacterial innoculum, obtained from the recycled sludge in the contact stabilization process, was
drained immediately upon return to the laboratory for bacterial enrichment. Roughly 5–10 mL of
enrichment culture was then transferred into the reactor where it remained overnight. After 24 h,
the culture was drained from the reactor. The reactor was replenished with mineral and growth
medium and phenolic wastewater feeding was initiated.
Sterilization of feed solution
A rigorous sterilization procedure was developed to prepare the microorganism-free feed solution.
Autoclave and filter sterilization were employed to prepare a large quantity of sterile solution.
The feed tank was cleaned thoroughly, assembled, and autoclaved before substrate and nutrients
were added. The distilled water was autoclaved in an autoclavable polycarbonate container at
121°C for 45 min. The distilled water was then transferred through sterilized Tygon tubing into
the feed tank. Desired volumes of stock substrate and nutrient solution, prepared in the autoclaved
bottles, were passed through a 0.45-m membrane filter and made to the desired final feed
volume. All the tubing used in feed preparation was sterilized prior to use. The main body of the
fixed-biofilm reactor was sterilized by using 75% isopropyl alcohol.

Figure 4(a) presents the phenol concentration in effluent varied over time at different hydraulic
retention times (HRTs). The curve of phenol concentration was described in three parts. First, the
phenol concentration increased steadily to about 54 mg/L (0.75 Sb0) for an HRT of 12 h, to 27
mg/L (0.37 Sb0) at an HRT of 18 h and to 19 mg/L (0.27 Sb0) at an HRT of 24 h during the first 3
days. At this period, biodegradation of phenol by biofilm was insignificant. The phenol
concentration curve was a typical dilute-in curve, which was a characteristic of completely mixed
bioreactor filled with clear water at time zero (Gaudy & Gaudy 1980).
The second part of the phenol curve was for the period 3–13 days, when the curves began
deviating from the peak of the dilute-in curve. The effluent phenol concentration leveled off and
10
negligible. The phenol flux increased abruptly at 2–7 days. During this period, the biofilm
thickened and vigorously consumed phenol. Thus, the difference in phenol concentration in the
bulk liquid phase and the biofilm/liquid interface increased, which significantly increased the
phenol flux into biofilm due to biological activity. During 7–40 days, the phenol flux remained
maximal because the phenol concentration in the effluent continued decreasing and then reached a
constant concentration under a steady state condition. A short HRT caused high flow rate to
reduce liquid film thickness, which increased phenol flux to diffuse into biofilm rapidly.

Phenol concentration profile
Figure 7 shows the phenol concentration profile in the liquid film and biofilm for different HRTs
at 35 days. The phenol diffused through the liquid film into the biofilm and formed a
concentration profile due to diffusional resistance. At 35 days, the reactor system reached a steady
state condition and biofilm thickness was about 426 µm. This biofilm can be caled a “ deep 
biofilm ” as the phenol concentration profile decreased rapidly near the solid surface of the
supporting medium under a steady state condition (Sáez & Rittmann, 1988). As can be seen in
Figure 7, a short HRT made phenol concentration profile steeper than long HRT in biofilm as a
high flow rate caused the flux to diffuse into biofilm rapidly.
Figure 7 Model simulated the phenol concentration profile in liquid film and biofilm for different
HRTs at 35 days
CONCLUSIONS
The values of biokinetic parameters for the biofilm model were determined using batch kinetic
tests. The mathematical model for phenol utilization by attached and suspended biomasses was
developed and verified by a fixed-biofilm column test. The fixed-biofilm reactor achieved very
high phenol removal efficiency. The removal efficiency for phenol in phenolic wastewater was
94–96.5% at different HRTs. The model simulated the performance of the fixed-biofilm reactor
very well for a non-steady state experiment of phenol utilization by phenol-utilizing bacteria. The
experimental approaches and model simulation presented in this study could be utilized to design
a pilot or full-scale fixed-biofilm process for biodegradation of phenolic wastewater from
petrochemical and oil refining plants.

Abstract
A series of batch tests in stirred-tank bioreactor were conducted to determine optimal initial
cultivation pH and temperature to elevate hydrogen production from fructose wastewater.
Hydrogen production efficiency was evaluated using specific hydrogen production potential
(SHPP) and maximum specific hydrogen production rate (SHPRm). The experiments of initial pH
were conducted at pH 4–8 at 55°C. The experimental results indicated that the initial pH
markedly affected HP and SHPRm, volatile fatty acids and distribution as well as butyrate/acetate
(BHu/HAc). The optimal initial pH for hydrogen production was 6 with peak values of SHPP
166.8 ml-H2/g-COD and SHPRm 26.7 ml-H2/g-VSS-h for fructose wastewater. Molasses
processing wastewater was shown to have higher SHPP (187.0 ml-H2/g-COD) and SHPRm (42.7
ml-H2/gVSS-h) than fructose wastewater at pH 6. The DGGE profiles indicated that molasses
processing wastewater is a better source as a substrate than fructose wastewater for the growth of
hydrogen-producing bacteria due to high staining intensity of bands.
1. Introduction
The microbial conversion of industrial wastes and residues into hydrogen is attracting and
increasing interest, this is due to hydrogen has been recognized as an ideal energy carrier of the
future because it is clean, recyclable and efficient [1,2,3]. In the recent study, hydrogen-producing
bacteria can utilize very different waste materials as carbon sources for hydrogen production and
enable simultaneous waste minimization, which is an additional benefit for today’s industry.
These waste-based hydrogen production processes mainly include milk industry wastewater [4],
lactic acid fermentation plant wastewater [5], distillery wastewater [6] and sewage sludge [7] as
well as municipal solid wastes [8].
Fructose and Molasses industry effluents are being researched for useful application of wastes.
Fructose is a simple reducing sugar found in honey and in the fruit and other parts of plants.
Fructose is formed when sucrose is hydrolyzed by the enzyme invertase. Today, high fructose
syrup has taken the place of sucrose, and has been widely used in many industries such as frozen
foods, dairy products, and canned food. The fructose wastewater has a chemical oxygen demand
(COD) of 50006000 mg/L. Molasses is a thick syrup by-product from the processing of
sugarcane or sugar beet into sugar and often used as raw material in alcohol distilleries. An
untreated molasses alcoholic fermentation wastewater has a high-organic content with COD in the
range of 50-100 g/L [9].
The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential for biohydrogen production from food
processing wastewater and observe the effects of initial cultivation pH and intermediate products
on hydrogen production.

Fig. 1 A laboratory-scale stirred-tank bioreactor.
Analytical Methods
Hydrogen in biogas was analysis using Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph
(Hewlett-Packard Development Co., Palo Alto, California) equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD) and a 2 m 1/8 s˝tainless columnMolesieve 5A (60/80 mesh). Nitrogen was
used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 23 ml/min. The operational temperature of the injection port,
the oven and the detector were 110°C, 60°C and 150°C. The volatile fatty acids including acetate,
propionate and butyrate were analyzed using an Agilent model 6850 gas chromatograph equipped
with an FID detector. The column was a 6′8′stainless column-10%SP-1200/1% H3PO4 (80/100
mesh). The operational temperature of the injection port, the oven and detector were maintained
at 140°C, 100°C and 140°C, respectively. Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 40
ml/min. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and volatile suspended solids (VSS) were
measured according to Standard Methods [12].
Cumulative biogas production curves were obtained over the course of the batch experiment and
analyzed using the modified Gompertz model [13] to obtain the hydrogen production potential (P),
the hydrogen production rate (Rm) and lag phase ().

Table 3 shows that the modified Gompertz model parameters were initial pH-dependent for
fructose and molasses wastewater. The Rm values increased with increased pH from 4 to 6. Rm
peaked at pH 6, which value was consistent with that of having peak SHPP value at pH 6. As to
the lag time (), both fructose and molasses wastewater has the same lag time except for initial
pH 5. The stirred-tank bioreactor with initial pH of 4-6 had the longest lag time of 12 h for
fructose wastewater and the longest lag time of 12 h for molasses wastewater with initial pH of 4
and 6.

A comparison of hydrogen production for experimental data and modified Gompertz model
simulation from fructose and molasses wastewater is shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). The
correlation coefficient (r2) range was 0.9370.995 for fructose wastewater and 0.792-0.992 for
molasses wastewater at the same pH range of 4-8. The hydrogen production curves using fructose
wastewater as an organic substrate has a better model fitting than molasses wastewater.
Figure 2 Cumulative hydrogen production fitted by modified Gompertz equation at different
initial pH levels: (a) from fructose wastewater (b) molasses wastewater.
The variation of specific hydrogen production potential (SHPP) with initial pH is shown in Figure
3(a). The plot shows that the initial pH did have an effect on specific hydrogen production
potential. The batch tests of fructose and molasses wastewater showed similar trends for specific
hydrogen production potential. The specific hydrogen production potential showed an increasing
trend then a declining trend. The SHPP value peaked at pH 6, which value was 166.8
ml-H2/g-COD for fructose and 187.0 ml-H2/g-COD for molasses. Visual observation showed

The acetate, propionate and butyrate were independent of pH in the range from 4 to 8. This
finding was in close agreement with the results obtained by Van Andel et al [15] based on a study
with pure culture of Clostridium butyricum.
Figure 4 Hydrogen production, hydrogen content, pH and volatile fatty acids profiles: (a) fructose
wastewater (at initial pH=6) and (b) molasses wastewater (at initial pH=6).
The ratio of butyrate to acetate concentration could vary with microbial growth condition during
fermentation process. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the ratio of butyrate (HBu) and acetate (HAc)
and cumulative hydrogen production varied with initial pH. The HBu/HAc ratio during hydrogen
production presented a similar pattern for all batch tests-the maximum HBu/HAc ratio occurred
during the exponential phase and this was followed by the stationary phase of hydrogen
production at which the ratio showed a declined trend. Although the maximum HBu/HAc ratio for

4. Conclusions
This work demonstrated that both fructose and molasses wastewater are good organic substrates
for producing biohydrogen. The initial cultivation pH markedly affects hydrogen production in
the hydrogen production potential, maximum specific hydrogen production rate, liquid
fermentation products concentration and HBu/HAc ratio. The maximum specific hydrogen
production potentials were 166.8 ml-H2/g-COD and 187.0 ml-H2/g-COD at initial pH of 6 for
fructose and molasses respectively. The maximum specific hydrogen production rate occurred at
the same pH 6. The peak value of maximum specific hydrogen production rate was 26.7
ml-H2/g-VSS-h and 42.7 ml-H2/g-VSS-h for fructose and molasses wastewater respectively. The
stationary phase of hydrogen production for all batch tests occurred after the HBu/HAc ratio
decreased. The finding of this study can be applied in the design of the high-rate hydrogen
production bioreactor using food processing wastewater as organic substrates.
