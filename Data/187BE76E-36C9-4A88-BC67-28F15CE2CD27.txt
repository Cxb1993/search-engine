Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to investigate the 
trajectory tracking problem of wheeled mobile robots. 
First, the analytic B-spline function is used to generate a 
smooth feasible trajectory between the initial and 
desired configuration so that the motion path can pass 
through desired intermediate points to satisfy the 
kinematic constraints and curvature restrictions. Given 
the desired B-spline trajectory, the corresponding 
reduced dynamics can be used to design the control law 
for the privileged coordinates. While the privileged 
coordinates can be driven to the desired values, the 
postured coordinates may deviate from the reference 
values significantly if the initial conditions are not set 
appropriately or there are some disturbances during the 
motion. To solve this problem, it is noted from the 
practical experience of driving that we may change the 
reference values of the privileged coordinates to steer 
the postured coordinates. The compensated values for 
the privileged coordinates may be inferred by fuzzy 
linguistic logic from the kinematic equations. 
Simulation results are utilized to illustrate the proposed 
methodology of trajectory tracking control is effective, 
and gives good results. 
1. Introduction 
The purpose of motion planning is to generate a path 
which can (1) link initial configuration to some desired 
finial configuration, (2) avoid any collision with the 
obstacles, (3) achieve optimization design based on the 
criterion of the least time, the shortest path or the 
minimum energy, and (4) satisfy the nonholonomic 
constraint and the restrictions of curvature. The shortest 
obstacle-free path established with the method of path 
planning may consist of grids, special coordinate points 
or the vertices of convex obstacles, and it is not 
necessarily a smooth curve. To solve this problem, we 
often parameterize the trajectory, and describe the 
trajectory with analytic functions. A popular one of them 
is the parametric B-spline, typically defined by a set of 
control points and a set of B-spline basis functions [1,2]. 
The desired shape of the curve can be modified by 
moving control points and knots. B-spline curves have 
completed properties such as representing a curve by a 
small set of control points; locally refined without 
changing their global shape and convex hull which make 
them suitable for representation forms in trajectory 
planning[3]. Nonholonomic properties most commonly 
arise in mechanical systems where the non-integrable 
constraints are imposed on the motions. The non - 
integrability of the nonholonomic constraints makes the 
problem of tracking control of mobile robot with rolling 
and non-slipping wheels very difficult to be managed. 
By Brockett’s necessary stability conditions[4], a 
nonholonomic system with under-actuated property can 
not be asymptotically stabilized to a desired 
configuration using any smooth time invariant state 
feedback. To stabilize such a system based on the 
kinematic model, only by the discontinuous feedback 
control[5,6], the time varying feedback control[7], and 
hybrid feedback control[8]. However, the kinematical 
model usually ignores the mass and the inertia of the 
physical systems. The control inputs of the kinematics 
have no concern with actual applied force or torque, 
even more without any physical significance and thus 
the designs are deemed impractical. Therefore, 
developing a complete controller structure for the 
nonholonomic systems should take the kinematic model 
and the dynamic model into account simultaneously. 
Fierro and Lewis[9,10] integrated a kinematic controller 
and a torque controller for stabilizing a nonholonomic 
mobile robot where exists the system uncertainty. Ge 
and Dong[11,12]investigated the point stabilization 
problems for uncertain dynamic model as well as 
kinematic skew symmetric chained form of the wheeled 
mobile robot, and then designing the adaptive controller 
for the combined system.  
In this project, we use cubic B-spline function for 
trajectory planning of the mobile robot. Applying 
constrained optimization method to solve control points 
of B-spline curve so that the motion path can pass 
through desired intermediate points and satisfy the 
kinematic constraints and the curvature restrictions. 
Next, it is then desired to develop a feasible and 
practical methodology of controller design which 
appropriately accommodates the dynamics and the 
kinematic constraints. The adaptive sliding mode 
controller is considered in the dynamical level where the 
dynamic parameters of the mobile robot are supposed to 
be uncertain. The practical experience of driving can be 
embedded in the fuzzy logic-based system in the 
kinematical level. A fuzzy rule mechanism is established 
to compensate the desired values of the privileged 
coordinates. A new set of reference values for the 
privileged coordinates is computed such that the 
adaptive sliding mode controller in dynamical level is 
then invoked to track the new reference, which in turn 
drives the postured coordinates to the desired B-spline

B-spline basis function of order k with the specified 
interval 1[ ,  )i i ku u + + , which is composed of piecewise by

Let { }0 1 1, , , n kU u u u + += L  represent a non-decreasing

specifying the distribution of the parameter u along the

Bi,k(u) is non-zero only on the interval 1[ , )i i ku u u + +∈  
such that the local support property can be easily derived. 
To explore the deBoor-Cox recursive formula, shown in

According to Eq. (4), the segmental B-spline curve can 
be further derived, which is especially useful for motion 
planning implementation. For an open uniform periodic 
knot vector, the B-spline curve (12) may be split up into 
1m +  segments, and each segment is denoted as ( ),js u

Furthermore, the representation of divided B-spline curve 
(16) can be simplified into the matrix form, which makes 
it possible to realize in constrained optimization 
programming. For the uniform knot vector with the same 
span 1j ju u u+∆ = − , the coefficients of zero-order basis 
function can be determined by [16]. To normalize the 
interval of each knot, the variable u should be replaced 
by [0,  1)t ∈ , and defined by

3.2 Constraint-Based Optimization Method 
To simplify the design, we adopt the cubic B-spline 
curve ( 3)k = to pass through each intermediate point at 
the initial position of corresponding curve segment 
0( )j ts t = , however, the last passing point is located on 
(10. )a (10. )b
  
4.  The Design of Hierarchical Controller 
 Consider the hierarchical model constructed by an 
under-actuated kinematical equation (10.b) and a 
reduced dynamical equation (10.a). The structure of the 
developed methodology consists of the adaptive sliding 
mode controller in the dynamical level and the fuzzy 
logic compensator in the kinematical level. The 
objective of the design is to obtain a hierarchical 
controller which enables the system to track a reference 
B-spline trajectory and satisfies the geometric and 
kinematic constraints. Here, the adaptive sliding mode 
controller is adopted due to its capability of dealing with 
parameter uncertainties so as to the privileged velocities 
(u=[v,w]) can be stabilized to the desired values. The 
above effort is not guaranteed that the position and 
orientation (ξ=[x,y,θ]) of the mobile robot to the desired 
values if the initial postured coordinates are not set 
appropriately or there are some disturbances during the 
motion. To overcome this problem, we propose a fuzzy 
logic system to reason the compensated values for the 
desired privileged velocities from the kinematics. A new 
set of reference values for the privileged velocities is 
obtained. The adaptive sliding mode controller 
mentioned above is then invoked to track the new 
reference, which in turn steers the postured coordinates 
to the desired values and to achieve the aim of the 
B-spline trajectory tracking control. The block diagram 
of the proposed control structure for the trajectory 
tracking task is depicted in Figure 4.

4.1 Fuzzy Logic Compensator in Kinematical Level 
Consider the following fuzzy logic system: 
: ,i e i e i e i i iR IF d A and B and C THEN v D w Eθ ϑ= = = ∆ = ∆ =  
where Ai, Bi, Ci , Di and Ei are fuzzy sets for ith rule; de 
is the error distance between the current position and the 
desired position; θe is error angle between the current 
and desired heading angle; ϑe denotes the orientation 
angle from the current position to desired position; ∆v 
and ∆w are the compensated values of linear velocity 
and angular velocity of the vertical axis at point Q of the 
rear wheels, respectively. Define the posture error vector 
ξe in body frame, which is a coordinate transformation 
of the difference between desired and current posture in 
inertial frame, which is described in Figure. 5.

 into our antecedent part of fuzzy 
rules, and consequent part of fuzzy rules generate two 
output variables ∆u = [∆v,∆w]. Obviously, from above 
description, the magnitude of de is employed to 
determine the compensated value of linear velocity ∆v. 
As to the compensated angular velocity ∆w, two 
variables θe and ϑe should take into consideration 
simultaneously. If only consider θe, a desired tracking 
performance cannot be guaranteed for the mobile 
robot. It may go forward parallel along the reference 
trajectory. If only consider ϑe variable, the 
compensated value ∆w of fuzzy inference will have 
high-frequency switch (chattering phenomena) near 
the reference trajectory.

 4.2 Adaptive Sliding Mode Control in Dynamic Level 
 Consider the reduced dynamical equation of 
nonholonomic systems as equation (10.a). An adaptive 
sliding mode controller is designed such that the 
privileged velocities of dynamics output converge 
asymptotically to the new reference value of the 
privileged velocities uc =ud + ∆u. The problem we 
consider here is to design the control torque τ such that 
( ) ( ) 0ct t− →u u  while t → ∞  so as to achieve the 
purpose of robust velocity tracking despite unknown 
dynamic parameters and bounded external disturbances. 
For convenience of robust adaptive controller design, we 
define the tracking error of the privileged velocities on 
dynamical model as 
e c= −u u u               (28) 
The sliding surface s = 0 is chosen as 
1 2[ ]
T
e e e es s dt= = + Λ = + Λ∫s u u u y ,    (29) 
where Λ  is a positive definite matrix whose 
eigenvalues are strictly in the right half complex plane. 
A new variable ur is introduced such that s = u - ur, i.e., 
r c e= − Λu u y . In this project, the reduced dynamics as Eq. 
(10.a) with unknown parameters is assumed to be 
expressed as a product of a regressor matrix 
( , , , )r rY q q u u& &  and an adjustable parameter vector ∆ . We 
denote ∆ˆ  be the estimation vector of ∆ , and ˆ= −∆ ∆ ∆%  
denotes the estimated error. Since ∆  is a constant 
vector, we have ˆ=∆ ∆&&% . From the property of [P3], the 
linear parameter form is employed in adaptive law 
design and to estimate the unknown parameters, then

The following theorem describes the hierarchical 
tracking performance achieved by the control algorithm 
(32) and adaptive law (33). 
Theorem 1. Consider the trajectory tracking systems 
is described by a dynamical error equation (31) 
containing unknown parameters and disturbances. A 
smooth desired privileged velocity uc is given by 
compensated inference discussed in Section 4.1. Further 
then, the control algorithm is designed by the adaptive 
sliding mode techniques can be expressed:

where Γ is a symmetric positive definite constant matrix, 
#
1B  is the left inverse of B1, Kd and Ke are also positive 
constants. Assuming that ( )c tu  are smooth and 
bounded. Then, the close loop error equations (31) are 
globally asymptotical stability, i.e., lim 0
t→∞
=s . This 
implies that the privileged velocities u converges on the 
desired velocities uc and the privileged coordinates y 
converge on the desired value yc as t→∞. 
Proof: To show the performance of the control 
algorithm and adaptive law proposed in Eq. (30) and Eq.

5.  Simulation Results 
  The simulations have been performed on the 
trajectory tracking problem of the mobile robot, which is 
shown in Fig. 1. In this simulation, the kinematic model 
and dynamic model are described in equations (10.a)  
and (10.b). The parameter specifications of physical 
model are given as mw = 1, mc = 20, Iw = 0.1, Ic = 17.75, 
Im = 2, b = 0.5, dr = 0.25, df  = 0.75, r = 0.1, φmax = π/3. 
In order to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed 
B-spline tracking control structure, we use a cubic 
B-spline function to represent a trajectory and pass 
through the following intermediate points: m=12, ts=1s, 
{(-15,-5),(-13,4),(-8,16),(-6,19) ,(-4,18),(-2,13),(1,10),(3
,6),(7,8),(8,12),(13,20),(15,25)}. The orientation angles 
of the initial node and the finial node are tanθs = 1 and 
tanθg = 1, respectively; and set the curvature 
restrictions 3jκ ≤ . Substituting above specification into 
optimization algorithm, the resulting B-spline trajectory 
and curvature are shown in Fig.8 and Fig.9.
