of the following three measurement scenarios: (1) for TOA:
measuring the distance between the MS and a specific BS,
(2) for TSOA: measuring the two distances between the MS
and a specific pair of BS’s, and then taking their sum, (3) for
TDOA: measuring the two distances between the MS and a
specific pair of BS’s, and then taking their difference. Here we
define a function tsgn : {TOA, TSOA, TDOA} → {0, 1,−1},
whose definition is
tsgn(τ) =


0 , if τ = TOA ,
1 , if τ = TSOA ,
−1 , if τ = TDOA .
(1)
The true distance in the ith MC, whose measurement type is
τi, is then
ti =
√
(x0 − x1,i)2 + (y0 − y1,i)2 +
tsgn(τi) ·
√
(x0 − x2,i)2 + (y0 − y2,i)2 , (2)
where the locations of the two BS’s involved in the ith MC are
denoted as (x1,i, y1,i) and (x2,i, y2,i) for TSOA and TDOA,
and as (x1,i, y1,i) for TOA.
The measured distance is then mi = ti + gi + ni, where
gi is a measurement noise and is modelled as a zero-mean
Gaussian random variable with standard deviation θi, and
ni is an NLOS error. Commonly adopted statistic models
for ni include Rayleigh, Rician, exponential, and chi-square
distributions, etc. The equation on mi can be rewritten as
ξi = mi − ti = gi + ni , (3)
where obviously ξi represents the overall measurement error.
With the assumption that gi and ni are independent, the pdf of
ξi can be obtained from the convolution of gi and ni’s pdf’s.
For the particular case that ni is Rayleigh distributed with
parameter ρi, we are able to find the close-form expressions
for ξi’s pdf :
fξi(x) =
ρix
λ3i
· e−x2/2λ2i Φ( ρix
θiλi
) +
θi√
2πλ2i
· e−x2/2θ2i , (4)
where λi =
√
ρ2i + θ
2
i and Φ(·) is the cumulative density
function (cdf) of the standard Gaussian random variable (r.v.).
Equation (4) will be referred to as the GRS(θi, ρi) distribution,
where GRS stands for Gaussian Rayleigh sum. More details
about the derivation can be found in our previous paper [9].
B. Distribution of measured angles
When the TOA measurement between some BS and the MS
is nearly LOS, we also have the nearly-LOS AOA from this
BS to the MS. The true direction from this BS, whose location
is denoted as (xi, yi), to the MS is then
φ = tan-1(
y0 − yi
x0 − xi ) . (5)
The measured direction is then mφ = φ + ξφ, where ξφ is a
measurement noise of direction and is usually modelled as
zero-mean Gaussian distributed with standard deviation σφ
[10].
III. NLOS MEASUREMENT IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHMS
The residual algorithms reviewed in Sec. I have several
constraints. First, it does not take the variance of Gaussian
measurement noise into account. Second, the square operation
in the residual leave out the effect of the sign of its differ-
ence. Third, it takes too much time to try out all possible
combinations of all available MC’s to determine the NLOS
measurements, especially when the total number of MC’s is
large. Finally, it does not perform well when the total number
of MC’s is small, especially when there are multiple NLOS
measurements.
In this paper, we will use three methods to identify NLOS
measurements and then their performances are compared. The
first one is purely Cong’s algorithm proposed in [4]. It will
serve as the comparison benchmark. The second one comes
from our modification from the first one, and the last one is
our algorithm of identifying NLOS measurements based on
the GRS model.
A. Method I
This is a new residual algorithm proposed in [4] for identify-
ing NLOS measurements in TDOA or TDOA/AOA positioning
schemes. It can overcome most of the constraints of the
previous residual algorithms. The new residual is defined by
P (Mi ≤ mi | LOS) = 12 +
1
2
· erf(mi − f(xˆ)√
2σi
) , (6)
where mi is a measured distance and f(xˆ) is the computed
distance with the estimated MS’s location xˆ. The higher this
cdf (new residual) is, the more likely the measurement is
biased by NLOS errors. For ease of referencing, we summarize
this new residual algorithm proposed in [4] and briefly restate
it in the three steps below:
1) Use the TDOA measurements from all the N − 1 non-
home BS’s (or MC’s) and possibly the AOA from the
home BS as well, to estimate the MS’s location xˆ.
2) Calculate the new residual in Eq. (6) for each of the
N − 1 non-home BS’s.
3) Compare the residual with a threshold λ. Those mea-
surements with residuals larger than the threshold are
identified as NLOS measurements.
B. Method II
This is a modified version of method I. When the MS is
standing still or moves slowly, the measurement of distances
for an MC can be repeated many (say, K) times. Then, their
sample mean and sample variance are computed. The modified
version then has nearly the same steps as in method I, except
that all of the measurements in method I are replaced by their
corresponding sample means. Moreover, we make use of the
WLSE (weighted least square estimation) method, instead of
the LSE (least square estimation) method, to compute the MS’s
location, where each weight is equal to the inverse of the
corresponding sample variance.

A. Method I
The algorithm of method I is quoted directly from paper [4].
The results it produces serve as the comparison benchmark
for the other two methods proposed in this paper. In Tables I
and II, we see that the detection probability (PD) of method I
is always the smallest among the three methods. In Tables III
and IV, we see that the AROC of method I is also the smallest
among the three methods. Therefore, both the PD and AROC
performance indices indicate that method I is the worst among
the three methods. However, method I does have one major
advantage: it does not require retransmission of signals in
TDOA and/or AOA measurements.
B. Method II
From both the PD in Tables I, II and the AROC in Tables III,
IV, we see that sometimes the performance of method II
is the best of all, especially when the number of MC’s is
large enough (say, four or more) and when the number of
NLOS measurements is small (say, two or less ). By applying
TDOA/AOA positioning, the result gets better for method II.
Comparing the results of method II to that of method I,
we see that introducing the WLSE method to improve MS’s
location estimation is a simple but very effective step for the
identification of NLOS measurement.

C. Method III
The procedure of method III is the simplest among the
three methods. It does not need MS’s location estimation to
identify NLOS measurements. So, the results produced by
TDOA and TDOA/AOA positioning are virtually the same,
where the small deviations were simply caused by randomness
in simulation. However, its performance is very good and
consistent. Its detection probability is always above 0.93 (see
Tables I and II) and the area under the ROC is always above
0.96 (see Tables III and IV), irrelevant of what the numbers
of MC’s and NLOS measurements are.
D. Comparison of the three methods
Simulations for many different combinations of identifica-
tion methods, number of MC’s, and number of NLOS MC’s
were conducted and the results were summarized into Tables I
-IV. Some discussions based on those four tables had already
been made in the three previous subsections. Here in this
subsection, we want to make more detailed observations and
comparisons for the three NLOS identification methods, by
checking the complete ROC curves (rather than just PD or
AROC). For simplicity, we only focus on the case that the
number of MC’s is four and the number of NLOS MC’s is one
or two. The corresponding ROC curves are shown in Figs. 2
and 3.
