1. Abstract
Nanowires of manganese oxide are
electrochemically synthesized on nickel
substrate by manganous acetate solution at
room temperature without any template or
catalyst. The synthesized electrode of high
porosity is composed of 8-12 nm nanowires
after 300oC annealing. These manganese
oxide nanowires show low crystallization. The
synthesized anode material has a much higher
capacity than the traditional graphite materials
for lithium storage. The electrode’s reversible
capacity reaches 1160 mAh g-1 at the first
cycle; the specific capacity retention after 50
charge-discharge cycles remains 61% of its
initial capacity. During cyclic voltammetric
measurements, the linear relationship between
peak current and square root of the scan rate
suggests that the reaction is controlled by a
semi-infinite diffusion of lithium.
Keywords: manganese oxide, lithium
storage, anode material, diffusion coefficient,
and lithium-ion batteries.
2. Introduction
Lithium-ion battery materials of high
specific capacity and high rate
dischargeability have attracted great attention.
Graphite materials are currently the
dominating anode materials because graphite
offers high capacity, high safety, high
electronic conductivity and low
electrochemical potential with respect to
lithium metal [1]. Nevertheless, graphite
materials can hardly meet the
high-energy-density demand of the electronic
devices today; therefore researches on
alternative anodes of higher lithium storage
capacities continue. Transition-metal oxides
have attracted attention due by their
advantageously high capacities [2-10]. Poizot
et al. proposed new anode materials, the
nanosized transition-metal oxides, for
lithium-ion batteries [2,3]. Electrodes made of
nanoparticles of transition-metal oxides (MO,
where M is Co, Ni, Cu or Fe) demonstrate
high electrochemical capacities (about 700
mAhg-1), great capacity retention, and high
discharging rates. More importantly, the
mechanism of Li reactivity in such electrodes
differs from the classical Li
insertion/deinsertion in graphite anodes or
Li-alloying processes in alloy electrodes [2].
The mechanism involves the formation and
decomposition of Li2O, accompanying the
reduction and oxidation of metal nanoparticles
respectively [2]. Wang et al. reported that the
nickel oxide showed a high reversible capacity
similar to that of anode materials
(transition-metal oxides) for lithium-ion
batteries [4,5]. The nanocrystalline NiO
thin-film electrode prepared by pulsed laser
ablation showed a reversible capacity of 700
mAh g-1 in the range of 0.01 –3.0 V vs.
Li/Li+[4]. A high capacity retention up to 100
cycles may be achieved by optimizing the
NiO films [4]. Improved specific capacity,
discharge rate, and cycling performance of the
NiO thin-film electrode have all been
attributed to its nanosized characteristics [4].
32, ranging from 30o to 80o. Batteries were
assembled in a dry room (temperature 25oC,
relative humidity 0.22%). The electrochemical
cell comprised a working electrode
(manganese oxide electrode), a counter
electrode (lithium metal), and a reference
electrode (lithium metal). A working electrode
wrapped with separator (Celgard 2320, 20 m
in thickness, USA) was placed between two
counter electrodes and then inserted into an
aluminum-plastic laminated film case.
Electrolyte was injected into the case and the
case was then sealed off at a reduced pressure
of 60 mmHg. The electrolyte was 1 M lithium
hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6, Tomiyama Pure
Chemical, Japan) in ethylene carbonate /
propylene carbonate / diethylene carbonate
(EC/PC/DEC = 1/1/2, by volume).
Electrochemical tests were performed on a
charge/discharge unit (Maccor model series
4000). Cells were charged at a constant
current (85 mA g-1) to a cutoff voltage of 10
mV vs Li/Li+. Discharge was performed at the
same rate to a cutoff voltage of 3.0 V vs Li/Li+.
Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were
taken by means of a potentiostat/galvanostat
(Schlumberger SI 1286). The voltage was
cycled in the range of 0.01 to 3.0 V vs Li/Li+,
with different scan rates.
4. Results and discussion
According to Preisler, -manganese
dioxides, which exhibit a marked growth
orientation and a fibrous structure as well as
cleavability, are deposited on the anodes
during electrolysis of manganous salt
solutions in sulfate bath [14,15]. As a result,
the -manganese dioxides are fibrous or wires
in nature. Figure 1a shows the SEM
micrograph of a manganese oxide electrode
after 300oC annealing. Electrode is highly
porous and is of nanowire structure.
Nanowires are 8-12 nm in diameter as shown
in Figure 1b (TEM image). In general, the
electrochemically deposited manganese oxide
contains structural water in the solid phase of
manganese oxide [14]. According to Preisler,
only a small percentage of water in
electrodeposited manganese dioxide is volatile
at 120oC, and a predominant portion of water
is desorbed in a relatively smooth manner up
to 350oC [14]. The electrodeposited
manganese oxide decomposes rapidly to form
Mn2O3 at temperatures beyond 500oC [16].
The water content within is known to affect
the electrochemical reactivity and the
thermodynamic stability of various manganese
oxide phases, as it causes variations in crystal
lattice and consequently in electrical
conductivity and electrode potential [17,18].
Moreover, water in the structure creates
challenges in lithium battery application
because of the instability of lithium with water
and the decomposition of water during
charge/discharge processes. Figure 2 shows
the XRD pattern of manganese oxide
nanowires after 300oC annealing. The
electrochemically deposited manganese oxide
resembles closely to -Mn(O,OH)2
(-manganese oxide hydroxide, JCPDS
17-0510). In order to avoid the structural
destruction by water contamination, the
annealing temperature has been set at 300oC.
However, from Figure 2, the XRD
characteristic peaks are broader. Such a
widening indicates a poor crystallinity of the
electrochemically deposited manganese oxide.
The mean grain size of the deposited
manganese oxide was calculated using
Scherrer’s equation with diffraction peak at 2
=37.1o: D = 0.9/(cos), where  is the
X-ray wavelength, is the full width at half
maximum (FWHM), andis the Bragg angle.
5scan rates. A broad anodic peak locates at
about 1.22 V vs Li/Li+, and a fairly sharp
cathodic peak at 0.22 V vs Li/Li+. These two
peaks might be attributed by the reversible
electrochemical oxidation and reduction of
manganese oxide with lithium in the electrode.
Compared with other transition metal oxides
in literatures, manganese oxide electrode with
nanowire structure has lower reduction and
oxidation voltages (0.22 V and 1.22 V vs
Li/Li+) than that of NiO (0.90 V and 2.30 V vs
Li/Li+) [4,5]. In general, lower reduction and
oxidation voltages vs Li/Li+ deliver higher
energy density; an example is graphite.
5. Conclusion
The synthesized anode is composed of
manganese oxide nanowires. The diameter of
the synthesized nanowires is about 8-12 nm
and these nanowires have poor crystallinity
after 300oC annealing. The electrode
reversible capacity in the first cycle is
approximately 1160 mAh g-1; and the large
irreversible capacity of 600 mAh g-1 is caused
by structural or textural modifications,
decompositions of electrolyte, and formation
of SEI film. The reaction mechanism of
manganese oxide with lithium is the
formation/decomposition of Li2O facilitated
by metallic manganese. Coulombic efficiency
of manganese oxide electrode is high except
for the first cycle; almost all the charged
capacity can be discharged. Decrease in cycle
capacity indicates a decrease of active
material with increasing cycle number; a
possible cause is that the catalytic manganese
metal may be isolated by the non-conducting
materials such as Li2O and passive SEI film.
