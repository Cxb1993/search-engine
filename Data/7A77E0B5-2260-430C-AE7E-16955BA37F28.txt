This paper analyzes the code tracking performance in the presence of signal blanking in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).
The blanking eﬀect is usually caused by buildings that obscure the signal in either a periodic or random manner. In some cases,
ideal blanking is used to remove random or periodic interference. Nevertheless, the eﬀect of temporary discontinuity of signal
often leads to the tracking and position error. To analyze this problem, three types of blanking model are considered: no blanking,
periodic blanking, and random blanking of the signals input into the code tracking loop. The mean time to lose lock (MTLL) is
to assess the performance of code tracking system under signal blanking. Finally, the eﬀect of steady-state tracking errors on the
performance of tracking loop resulting from blanking environment is also discussed.
1. Introduction
The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides in-
formation of position, velocity, and time by means of
spread spectrum techniques [1, 2]. An essential way to
predict the performance of GNSS system is the ability of
the code tracking loop to maintain “lock”. When the signal
is blanked, most of the GNSS positioning methods suﬀer
from degradation in accuracy and increase in the receiver
processing time [3]. The blanking eﬀect is usually caused by
buildings, wall, trees, rotation of vehicle, or randommanners
that obscure the signal periodically [4]. Besides the above
factors, solar radio bursts caused by sunspots also cause
the receiver to receive blank signal for a long time [5]. Of
course, the use of ideal blanking method can mitigate the
eﬀect of pulse interference on positioning performance of
receiver [6, 7]. With regards to the improvement methods
for blanking eﬀect, studies in early research only determine
and deal with the phenomenon prior to signal correlation
[8]. When the signal suﬀers from blanking eﬀect, literature
review on the postprocessing of code tracking is relatively
few.
In this paper, the performance of code tracking loop in
the presence of noise and blanking is assessed. The code
tracking loop considered here is a second-order delay lock
loop (DLL) with an early-late gating of 1/2 chip. Three blank-
ing models are presented: no-blanking, periodic blanking,
and random blanking. The eﬀect of random blanking on the
loops is more emphasized because two blanks may appear
contiguously, which causes the loops to be without signal
for a longer time. It inevitably influences the signal tracking
performance. Therefore, the mean time to lose lock (MTLL)
is shown to evaluate the performance of code tracking loop
under the presence of signal blanking.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 gives a description of signal blankingmodel and the
diagram of code tracking loop. In Section 3, the comparison
of loop performance is discussed. Then, survey of code
tracking technique is also presented in this section. At last,
a brief summary concludes in Section 4.

Finally, the closed-loop transfer function Hnc(s) is given by
Hnc(s) = (2α(2− Δ)P
′/Tc)F(s)(1/s)
1 + (2α(2− Δ)P′/Tc)F(s)(1/s) . (23)
The noise variance in the delay error can be computed
and is shown as follows:

(24)
Now approximate Sν′nc (f) with Sν′nc (0) and assume that the
noise spectral density is essentially flat across the loop
bandwidth [10]. Thus (24) can be modified as
σ2nc ∼=
2BnSν′nc (0)

3.3. α Factor. When the time delay estimation error is small,
and the phase can be correctly estimated, the variance of
code delay error due to noise in the closed-loop operation
is obtained which uses (16) and (25). However, the α value
influences the tracking performance in the whole loop.
The α value is set as one under no-blanking. Under the
model of periodic blanking, the value of duty cycle Tp
aﬀects the reception duration of desired signals. That is,
the larger the duty cycle, the higher probability the tracking
loop may lose lock of the signals and also the larger the
variance of error. This is because the correlation loss caused
by signal discontinuity leads to the reduction of reception
power during correlation process [4]. Thus, in the case of
periodic blanking, the reduction factor for c-DLL is depicted
as α = 1 − Ta/Tr . In addition, regarding random blanking
case, α is set as Pr(u). Substitute α into (16) to find the
variance of code delay error, which is given by
σ2c =

, for random blanking.
(26)
With respect to nc-DLL case, given that BnTc  1, the
variance of code delay error owing to noise in the close
loop operation can be given by (25). Similarly, blanking also
aﬀects tracking performance in nc-DLL. Thus, substitute α
into (25) to find the variance of code delay error, which is
expressed as

4. Numerical Results
4.1. Simulation Procedure. To eﬀectively verify the eﬀect of
diﬀerent blanking scenarios on the performance of code
tracking loop, this chapter establishes a simulation system
and presents results for the delay lock loop. The simulations
are conducted using Matlab software. The following will
describe the simulation procedure.
Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering 7
(3) Digital IF data with diﬀerent power of satellite signals
is generated, respectively. The procedures of (1) and (2) are
repeated to analyze the variance of code delay error under the
blanking with diﬀerent C/N0.
(4) Simulation of the relation between MTLL and
diﬀerent blanking models.
Through the above simulation process, we can accurately
analyze the standard derivation of the code phase error and
loss of lock under diﬀerent blanking scenarios.
4.2. MTLL Computation. MTLL is utilized to assess the per-
formance of code tracking system and it also characterizes
themean time that the DLL stays in its tracking range (±3Δ/2
chip spacing) [11, 12]. One model for the MTLL is derived
through solving the Fokker-Planck equation. TheMTLL, T∗L ,
for the first-order DLL with Δ = 1 chip spacing is obtained
as depicted in the following:
2BnT∗L =

ε
exp
[−G(x)
σ2
]
exp
[
G
(
y
)
σ2
]
dxdy,
(28)
where σ2 and ε denote variance of code delay error and delay
error, respectively. G(x) is the integral of the discriminator
function G(x) = ∫ x SΔ(ε)dε, which is an even function of x.
Substituting the variance of code delay error in (26), (27),
respectively, into (28), the T∗L value under diﬀerent scenarios
of blanking is derived. Equation (27) is applicable to first-
order and second-order DLL. In fact, the result of (27) is
valid for any closed loop, with a discriminator function given
by SΔ(ε). According to Holmes, the MTLL for the second-
order DLL can be derived from (28) by decreasing σ by 1 dB
[13].
4.3. Performance Analysis. In all simulations, assume the re-
ception time of digital IF data is 30 seconds, the noise
bandwidth of c-DLL and nc-DLL is Bn = 10Hz, respectively,
the integration time is 2ms, and the signal blanking time is
20ms every unit. Generally, the smaller the Bn, the longer the
computation time to lock code phase shift in code tracking
loop. On the contrary, the larger the Bn, the larger the error
of code phase. Typically, the value is set between 0.1Hz and
10Hz. Suppose that in periodic blanking, the duty cycle is
5% (every 400ms) and the probability of random blanking is
also 0.05. The major reason for such a sameness is to analyze
the eﬀect of the two blanking models on the performance of
code tracking loop. Both analytical and simulation results are
demonstrated in Figure 4. The analytical result for the c-DLL
and nc-DLL under blanking is computed via the formula
(6)–(26) in Section 3. In contrast, the simulation results
are derived by averaging a series of 50 Monte Carlo closed-
loop simulation results. When the front-end bandwidth
is fixed, the tracking error is controlled, mainly, by the
correlator spacing for an early minus late discriminator.
Figure 4(a) illustrates the duration of duty cycle in pe-
riodic blanking versus the result of tracking error under the
scenario ofC/N0 = 14 dB-Hz. The threshold is set to |ε| ≤ 2/3
chips for Δ = 1 chip case. The time for one sample of the
delay error ε to exceed this threshold is the time to lose lock,
since at either of these points, the tracking error S-curves
essentially goes to zero.
The figure presents that when the duty cycle is above
15% (blanking time as 300ms, duty cycle as 2000ms),
the tracking loop loses lock. Figure 4(b) demonstrates the
relation between the probability of random blanking and the
result of tracking error. It is shown that when the blanking
probability is above 0.085, the loop loses lock (blanking time
is 20ms every unit).
Figure 5 indicates that MTLL is computed by averaging
the time to lose lock in all 50 runs for diﬀerent blanking cases
with Bn = 10Hz, and Tc = 2ms, over a range of C/N0. In
Figure 5(a), it is observed that nc-DLL with random blanking
drops to lose lock slightly earlier than the periodic and the
no-blanking case. The same result is shown in Figure 5(b).
Figure 6 illustrates and compares the standard deviation of
tracking error (in the unit of chip) under the scenario of
diﬀerent blanking eﬀects and two DLL structures. It can also
be observed that under the scenario of lower C/N0, random
blanking has greater influence on the performance of two
models of DLL than periodic blanking. In the case of higher
C/N0 (C/N0 > 30 dB-Hz), the eﬀects of periodic blanking
and random blanking are pretty close. The results show a
little degradation in code tracking performance under the
small probability of random blanking and small duty cycle of
periodic blanking. When the probability of random blanking
is above 0.085 and the duty cycle of periodic blanking is
above 15%, the signal loses lock.
5. Conclusion
The eﬀect of blanking on the performance of c-DLL and nc-
DLL has been presented in previous sections. The perform-
ance evaluation is the standard deviation of the phase error
and loss of lock. Numerous blanking values are simulated.
The eﬀect of blanking in c-DLL degrades the receiver
power by − log(α2). Assume the duty cycle of blanking is
smaller than inverse tracking loop bandwidth, the received
power degradation is slightly proportional to the duty factor
of blanking in the case of periodic blanking under the
scenario of nc-DLL. Under the same prerequisite for random
and periodic blanking, the simulation results show that
the random blanking degrades the DLLs (c-DLL and nc-
DLL) performance more severely than the other blanking
cases. In addition, the eﬀect of ideal periodic blanking on the
performance of tracking loop serves as the reference for the
future use of ideal blanking to mitigate pulse interference.

spacing of correlator. The use of narrow correlator to reduce chip spacing can effectively 
mitigate multipath and noise, which cuts down the error of 7080 m to 810 m (van 
Dierendonck et al., 1992). Note that the use of narrow correlator technique in coherent 
discriminator may lead to the lock failure in code delay locked loop without the cooperation 
of phase locked loop (PLL). 
The strobe correlator and edge correlator are both solutions for multipath mitigation (Garin 
et al., 1996). The strobe correlator is implemented using two different narrow correlator 
discriminators. The strobe correlator and edge correlator developed by Ashtech only 
provide code correlation for C/A code. The enhanced strobe correlator (Garin and 
Rousseau, 1997) offers carrier phase correction and code correction for C/A code. With the 
additional carrier phase correction in terms of multipath its real-time dynamic processing 
outperforms previous methods. Note that the narrow correlator and strobe correlator do not 
encompass carrier phase correction. Thus, their sensitivity approaches that of conventional 
correlator. 
Another discriminator design is early 1/ early 2 (E1/E2) correlator (Mattos, 1996; van 
Dierendonck and Braasch, 1997). The method utillzes part of correlation coefficients not 
subject to multipath effect for multipath mitigation. That is, it employs two correlators with 
the spacing and location at the front end of correlation function. However, this method is a 
choice between noise mitigation and multipath mitigation. 
The multipath estimation method initial estimates multipath signal and then subtracts it 
from received signal so that the signal approaches direct signal. Literature review that 
resembles this algorithm are MEDLL, MET. (van Nee, 1992; van Nee et al., 1994), which 
utilize maximum likelihood estimation technique and recursive least square method to 
estimate the magnitude, delay, phase and erase it from received signal. Though the above 
estimation methods can not completely eliminate multipath signal, they present significant 
improvment in terms of multipath delay within certain range. 
Nevertheless, these techniques have difficulties in mitigating short-delay multipath signals 
(less than 0.1 PN code chip or approximately 30 m). Scholars have proposed methods on 
short-delay multipath mitigation (Sleewaegen et al., 2001; Stone and Chansarkar, 2004). 
However, these techniques still have drawbacks. The method proposed by Sleewaegen 
requires a scaling factor, depending on multipath environment, to link the signal amplitude 
with the range error. The method proposed by Stone and Chansarkar is to estimate the 
pseudorange error on the basis of a statistical model, which requires large numbers of 
collected data. Consequently, the performances of these two methods are significantly 
influenced by multipath environment. 
The author has proposed an adaptive filter in 2008 (Chang and Juang, 2008), which adopts 
five tap-delay to effectively mitigate short-delay multipath. Though this method is efficient 
in short-delay multipath mitigation, it does not guarantee that the receiver will not receive 
multipath signal at different time delay under variable environment. Moreover, the 
correlator technique of coventional receiver is not quite capable of accurately describing the 
data distribution of correlated signal, which results in longer period of time to estimate 
multipath parameter. Thus, this paper utilizes multi-correlator technique in combination 
with proposed method to mitigate the mystical multipath signal. Simulation results show 
that the multi-correlator technique can clearly present the output distribution of correlator, 
make adaptive filter rapidly estimate multipath parameter and cope with multipath signal 
at different time delay.

Thus, pseudorange multipath analysis encompasses simulation of direct and indirect path 
signals and determination of zero-crossing of distorted discrimintator function. There are 
three multipath parameters to consider: strength, delay and phase. The absolute value of 
each parameter is irrelevant. The upper and lower bounds of the multipath error can be 
determined, for a given multipath-to-direct ratio, by fixing the relative multipath phase at 0 
and pi radians, respectively, and varying the relative multipath delay. At each delay point, 
the distorted discriminator curve is determined and the resulting zero-crossing point and 
pseudorange error are calculated. The result of an example is presented in Fig. 2, which 
illustrates result of the theoretical multipath error envelope versus the multipath delay. The 
code autocorrelation sidelobes have been ignored. This simulation is offered in the case of 24 
MHz bandwidth receiver filter, 1-chip, 0.5-chip, and 0.2-chip early-late (E-L) spacing and 
unaltered multipath amplitude. A conventional GPS receiver adopts a delay-lock loop with 
a 1-chip spacing between early and late correlators. The smaller E-L spacing is regarded as 
narrow-correlator architecture. Narrow-correlator receivers typically utilize spacings in the 
range of 0.05 to 0.2 PRN chips.

and 0.2-chip E-L DLL receiver; Multipath component is half the strength of direct signal. 
2.2 Signal model 
A GPS receiver may receive a number of reflected signals and direct signal from the 
satellite. The error source of GPS consist of ionosphere delay, troposphere delay, receiver 
noise and multipath effect. Except for multipath, the other errors can be significantly 
decreased through advanced prediction and differential correction method. It is hard to 
depict the statistical model of the received signal in the presence of multipath. However,

The makeup of v  is consitituted by third correlation (location as 0) because the   of the 
rest correlators is 0. The makeup of R  is based on the location of selected correlator. With 
the v  and R  matrix known apriori, the magnitude of the signal in terms of the distribution 
set up by correlator can be known based on 1  R v . The more the correlators, the clearer 
the distribution of the signal. 
  
Fig. 3. Comparision of single correlator and multi-correlator. 
It is known that the muti-correlator can depict the makeup of signal. Thus, we will see if 
multi-correlator can estimate direct signal with the direct signal plus multipath signal. 
Assume the multipath delay as 0.25 chip, signal magnitude as 0.5 and five correlators are 
shown as Fig. 4. Based on 1  R v , the distribution of signal is known. Apparently, a 
correlation value exists between third and fourth correlator and the   of fourth correlator is 
lower. Using the negative correlation value form fourth correlator, we can elminate 
multipath. Fig. 5 illustrates the multipath mitigation when the location of time delay is at the 
location of set multi-correlator.

When the multipath delay is not at the set correlator, the calculated value after the above

2.4 Anti-multipath filter with multiple correlator 
The previous chapter has clearly presented the advantage of multi-correlator method and its 
operation process. This chapter will elaborate how to constitute an anti-multipath filter 
based on multi-correlator. Fig. 5 shows the block diagram of the multipath mitigation 
system. The received signal is processed in a RF filter, then downconverted and sampled to 
a digital IF signal. 
The tracking module consists of multiple correlator, code/carrier generator, discriminator 
and filter. The purpose of this module is to acquire accurate code phase and the carrier 
phase from PLL and DLL. The multipath estimator is used to estimate the correlation 
parameter of multipath, on the basis of the adaptive filter by employing duplicated signal 
and digital IF signal. Fig. 7 demonstrates that the estimated signal parameters are sent to the

2.4.2 Adaline-based filter 
The function of a multipath estimator is to estimate the multipath delay using Adaline-
based filter, shown in Fig. 9. It adopts the tap-delay line with an Adaline network (Widrow 
and Hoff, 1960) to constitute this structure without a non-linear element. An adaptive

where [ ]n  denotes the output layer error term. k , k , and k  are estimated as the 
absolute value of weight kw , the phase angle of weight karg(w )  and the value of delay 
element kd , respectively. The bias weight bw  connected to a constant input bc =+1, 
effectively controls the input signal level of the filter. Note that the digital IF signal given in 
(1) is adopted as the desired signal and the output of DLL and PLL serves as the filter input 
signal. The reference signal is determined by (7) which generates the output of each delay 
element. Therefore, the estimated delay parameters from the filter weights and the delay 
element can be derived on condition that the learning algorithm has converged. The 
learning rate coefficient   determines stability and convergence rate and a BP trained 
reference signal is adopted to obtain the minimum of (9) (Widrow 1986; Jacobs 1988). 
Suppose the learning rate is too large, the search path will oscillate about the desired path 
and converge more slowly than a direct descent. Nevertheless, the descent will progress in 
small steps if the learning rate is too small. It will greatly significantly increases the total 
time to convergence. Consequently, an adaptive coefficient where the value of   is a 
function of the error derivation is adopted as the solution (Schalkoff, R. J., 1997).

2.4.3 Correlation extractor 
After the use of adaptive filter, the estimated parameters can be obtained and the correlation 
decomposer divides the estimated parameters into multipath and direct signal. Besides, the 
autocorrelation function of multipath signals is subtracted from analog-to-digital (A/D) 
converter output of the received signal. In the decomposer process, it is assumed that the 
values of the first peak amplitude tap weight are the direct signal and the remainders are 
multipath signals. Fig. 5 presents an example where the direct signals refers to the first peak 
k l=  and the multipath signal amplitude denotes the remnants kl K  . Suppose that the 
multipath channel has a decreasing power delay profile. The multipath signal parameter is 
adopted to calculate the correlation value. The correlation equation of estimated multipath 
signals with amplitude k , delay k  and carrier phase k  is written as: 
  
Adaptive Filtering Applications

3.1 Simulation parameter 
The digital IF frequency of a GPS signal is /2  =1.25 MHz and the sampling rate is 5 
MHz. The delay chip of the multipath signal varies from 0 to 1.5 chips with the phase of 0 
and   radians with regard to the direct signal. In conventional correlator simulations, code 
phase error and carrier phase error are computed with 1 chip early-late discriminator. The 
chip spacing of a narrow correlator is less than 1 chip. A spacing of 0.2 chips utilized to 
serve the discriminator functions. Two different narrow correlator discriminators are 
adopted in a strobe correlator and the chip spacing of the two narrow correlators can be 
adjusted to 0.1 and 0.2 chip. The same parameters are also adopted in both enhanced strobe 
and edge correlators. The E1/E2 tracker of the two correlators is located at E1 0.55=-  and 
E2 0.45=-  with 0.1 chip spacing (Irsigler, M. et al, 2003). The Adaline-based adaptive filter 
method with the parameter of tap delay d = 0.01 chip, 0.1 chip, 0.5 chip and its 5 delayed 
tap is employed as the input to the filter. The number of multi-correlator is set as five. The 
initial learning rate is 0.05, the number of training samples is 5000 at 1ms C/A code period 
and the weights are initialized to 1. The performance is assessed on a separate test set of 
100ms samples measured at intervals of 1ms samples during the adaptive process. 
3.2 Performance analysis and comparison 
With regard to crucial multipath mitigation techniques of internal receiver, the multipath 
performance of these correlation techniques will be compared with each other, including the 
proposed method. Thus, the envelopes of all techniques described above are plotted into the 
same diagram to make a comprehensive comparison of multipath mitigation performance 
Figs. 10-12 compare the error envelopes of the code phase and carrier phase for all of the 
multipath mitigation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed method with 
multipath delay at the location of set correlator as d = 0.5 chip case has both the best 
multipath mitigation performance. Assume the location of correlator is not at multipath delay 
( d = 0.1 chip), it also presents good performance. The conventional PLL has a maximum 0.52 
radians in carrier phase error. Therefore, the use of the conventional correlator can yield very 
large maximum multipath errors and reveals the worst mitigation performance. The same 
results hold true for both narrow and edge correlators. Note that since the narrow, the 
MEDLL, the edge and strobe correlators do not provide any carrier phase elimination, their 
sensitivity to multipath is almost the same as the 1-chip early-late correlator. Only slight 
differences can be observed due to differences in their code multipath mitigation. 
These figures indicates that through the use of proposed method in combination with multi-
correlator technique with a delay element 0.5d =  chip, both code and carrier phase errors 
are reduced in the range of delay from 0 through 1.5 chip. In contrast, through the adoption 
of the proposed method with a tap delay 0.5d = , the code and carrier phase error decrease 
significantly in the range of delay from 0 to 1.5 chip. The figure shows that the use of multi-
correlator technique can effectively reduce code phase error. Nevertheless, for carrier phase 
error, its performance remains the same. The reason is because carrier phase error is not 
related to multi-correlator. In the case of the tap delay 0.5d = , multipath mitigation 
performance degrades in comparison with the case of d 0.1 = . This is because to the 
accuracy of the estimated delay profile in the Adaline-based filter depends on the tap delay 
d . The smaller the d  the better the performance of multipath mitigation. In the case of the

Note that Fig. 11 reveals that every DLL structure lacks of performance enhancement for 
short delay multipath signals. Nevertheless, the proposed method with multi-correlators 
can perform better in short delay and medium-to-long-delay multipath environment.

complexity receiver. In comparison, even though the edge, the E1/E2 and the MEDLL 
designs are higher in cost, they are better than the conventional, narrow, and strobe 
correlators in performance. 
In fact, there are inherent limitations in almost every technique. Note that the combined 
features of proposed method prevails over those of other techniques. In addition, the 
condition of short-delay and medium-to-long-delay multipath renders the effect of 
hardware complexity in Adaline-based filter insignificant. Consequently, the proposed 
method is a well-suited and well-balanced application in multipath mitigation.

4. Conclusion 
Multipath is the primary error source in high-precision-based GNSS applications and is also a 
significant error source in non-differential applications. Various receiver designs have been on 
the market and claim various multipath mitigation functions. Most of these techniques can be 
characterized either as discriminator function shaping or correlation function shaping. In this

value is calculated from a neighborhood of the samples of the 
original signal. Likewise, a new value in decimation is 
estimated from a neighborhood of samples and replaces these 
values in the minimized signal.. Implementation of integer 
factor interpolation and decimation algorithms can be 
conducted through efficient finite impulse response (FIR) 
filter and are relatively fast. 
Note that it can be efficient to process data at a different 
sampling frequency than one given in a data set. The reason 
for utilizing decimation of the GPS signal is not only to reduce 
the size of the data set but also optimize the data set size for 
FFT algorithm.

B.  Proposed Method  
A block diagram of proposed signal acquisition system 
using DWT is shown in Fig. 1. NCO depicts the numerical 
controller oscillator. The function of the decision logic is that 
it separates signal from noise by thresholding wavelets 
coefficients. Assume that the ideal incoming signal at the 
baseband is modeled as follows: 
0( ) ( ) ( ) exp( 2 ( ) ) ( )k k k d k kr t AG t D t j f f t n t= − − − + +τ τ π ʳʳʳ(1) 
where A  is signal amplitude, ( )G t −τ  is the C/A spreading 
code at time kt  with delay τ , ( )D   is the navigation data 
which is ignored in this letter. 0f  is the intermediate 
frequency (IF), and df  is the Doppler frequency. ( )kn t  is 
white Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance 2nσ . The 
input digitized IF signal, ( )kr t , is mixed to baseband. The in-
phase kI  and quadrature-phase kQ  components are utilized as 
the real and imaginary input, respectively, when calculating 
the DWT after the carrier removal. The signal k k ky I jQ= +  
utilizing DWT with first level is decomposed into different 
subbands, each of which has a different resolution and is 
called “Analysis Filter Bank”ʳ (in Fig. 2). This is depicted as

and nh  are the analysis filter bank which depicts low-pass and 
high-pass filter with impulse response, respectively. In 
particular, this method is iterated only on the lower band in 
order to achieve finer frequency resolution at lower 
frequencies. As a result, the lower band signals Lka  are 
correlated with the low-pass filtered version of replica code 
L
k mG + , which also employs the DWT by circularly shifting the 
local replica and the m  of which stands for the number of 
samples the replicated C/A code is phase shifted. This process 
resembles the circular convolution and the correlation is

where “ ⊗ ” is convolution operator. F , F −1  and ‘∗ ’ denote 
FFT, inverse FFT and the complex conjugate operator, 
respectively. The major difference between (4) and traditional 
FFT-based method is that the proposed method can get rid of 
the redundancy of adopting traditional FFT-based search and 
only half samples are employed compared with traditional FF-
based search. The same method can be executed by adopting 
signal decimation and interpolation, the results of which are 
less effective than those using DWT as shown in experiment 
results section. Finally, the output version mC  is reconstructed 
from the shrunk wavelet coefficients. That the halfband filters 
form the orthonormal bases makes the reconstruction in this 
case very easy. The above procedure is followed in reverse 
order for the reconstruction. The signals at every level are 
upsampled by two, passed through the synthesis filters bank 
(high-pass and low-pass, respectively, are shown in Fig. 3), 
and then added. 
Many methods for setting the threshold have been 
proposed. In this paper, Donoho’s soft thresholding function is 
utilized [9], which is shown as follows:

provides potential multipath mitigation without additional

The proposed novel discriminator can achieve an 
unambiguous BOC tracking and reduce the receiver

only three correlators per channel to solve ambiguous 
problem. The proposed discriminator is highly 
recommended for low-cost receivers which call for easy 
BOC tracking and can minimize the hardware 
requirements.

ABSTRACT  
 
This paper proposes the design and construction of an 
intelligence vehicle capable of mining, navigation 
positioning, and avoiding obstacle. The multiple sensor 
modules and micro-controller with data fusion technique 
are integrated in order to guarantee the autonomy of 
vehicle. In vehicle design, this paper presents a vehicle 
equipped with three wheels and driven by front-wheels 
whose speed difference changes the moving direction of 
vehicle. Regarding the choice of sensor module, the 
system adopts ultrasonic transducers and infrared 
proximity sensors to detect the distance between obstacle 
and vehicle to avoid collision and maintain fixed distance. 
The positioning estimator utilizes electronic compass, 
gyroscope, odometry, and accelerometer and combines 
GPS module to navigate safely. Color sensor is used for 
exploration. The data fusion method is accomplished 
through programmable logic decision technique and 
implemented on micro-controller board. The proposed 
prototype vehicle is experimented on outdoor onion fields. 
Firstly, under sole adoption of GPS module, the system 
can initially estimate the absolute position of vehicle. 
Then, the system can determine its relative position 
through combination with navigator. During the moving 
process of vehicle, the vehicle can smoothly move on 
onion fields without collision using the proposed sensing 
system onboard, obstacle detection and mining system. 
This technique can be applied to precise agriculture in the 
future.   
 
INTRODUCTION  
 
In recent years, with the gradual enhancement of 
mechatronics technique, traditional manual work has been 
replaced by automatic mechanics. The mature 
micromechanics (MENs) techniques have brought a new 
potential and possibility to automatic mechanic design 
technique. The most noteworthy is the birth of 
intelligence mechanic system. In modern life, the 
application of such a technique ranges from childern’s 
toys, home care robots, and robot vacuum cleaners to 
outdoor purposes, such as agriculture, surface mining, 
underground mining, quarrying, construction, etc. [Stentz, 
2001; Blackmore, 2007]. However, the application of

signal. The second module receives signals from color 
sensor, gyroscope, and accelerometer. The third module 
receives signals from ultrasonic, infrared sensors, 
electronic compass, and odometry. 
 
 
Figure 1. Embedded multi-sensors system. 
 
The inertial measurement unit (IMU), composed of an 
accelerometer, a gyroscope and electronic compass, is 
utilized to collect orientation and positioning data. The 
function of the accelerometer is to offer the vehicle 
acceleration data to calculate traveled distance and the 
gyroscope provides angular acceleration data to compute 
the heading of the vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with 
two optical encoders on each wheel which offers 
information of the direction where the wheel turns and the 
distance it has covered. These systems adopt dead 
reckoning to calculate the vehicle’s location. Data 
collected by each sensor is sent to the microcontroller 
where preliminary data processing is conducted for the 
information of vehicle navigation. The data is stored with 
the heading ID to identify the data type. In the following 
section, each of the modules above will be elaborated.  
 
Robotic Vehicle Base 
 
The design of an autonomous vehicle takes into 
consideration its environment, the weight it carries and 
the size of the vehicle is generally made up of a simple 
chassis, two drive wheels and an embedded processor. Fig. 
2 demonstrates the outlook of proposed vehicle, which 
shows that the chassis is made of aluminum material and 
design in three-wheel. The three wheel are made of off-
road tires with the diameter of 0.3 m so that the vehicle is 
able to move on mound. The vehicle adopts two-level 
design. Microcontroller, motor controller and battery can 
be placed on the lower-level and notebook can be placed 
on the upper-level. Various sensors can be placed around 
the vehicle.  
 
The vehicle itself, including two motors, weighs about 16 
kg. The addition of notebook, controller and battery, etc, 
make the total weight to 27.6 kg. The price of the vehicle, 
including motors, bearing, sensors, GPS module and not 
including notebook, is approximately TWD 26000, which

is predictable for development cost evaluation of this 
vehicle. 
 
Embedded Multi-Sensor System 
 
This section presents the whole control system 
components of autonomous vehicle, which is composed 
of microcontroller, motor controller, and sensors.  
 
     Micro-controller board 
The choice of microcontroller is very significant for robot 
vehicle design because it determines the electrical of the 
whole system and the software, which can operate the 
robot vehicle. In 1992, American Parallax Inc. presents a 
microcontroller structure, called “BASIC Stamp”. The 
read only memory (ROM) of this microcontroller is 
inbuilt with a tiny and specific BASIC interpreter, termed 
PBASIC. With PBASIC, control application program of 
embedded system can be developed with the writing 
ability of BASIC program language, which renders the 
learning of embedded system easier. The program 
language of BASIC Stamp is equipped with the particular 
function of typical microcontrollers, including pulse 
width modulation (PWM), inter integrated chip ( 2I C ) 
serial communication, liquid crystal display (LCD) driver, 
etc. The control core of proposed vehicle utilizes BS2p40 
module and BASIC Stamp second version complier to 
develop function.  
 
     Motor controller 
Through simple command setup, the motor control board 
of the vehicle can easily dictate the direct current (DC) 
motor, change the speed of motor at any time and be 
aware of the present status of motor, such as speed or 
direction. It can tolerate the maximum coherent output of 
1079International Technical Meeting of The Institute of Navigation, 
San Diego, CA, January 24-26, 2011
Navigation Algorithm 
 
It is necessary to select and integrate the collected data 
from each module because the vehicle is equipped with 
multiple sensor modules. Thus, in the program writing of 
navigation algorithm, the micro-controller core can 
calculate the current location based on the collected data 
from each sensor and then conduct vector-based 
navigation algorithm relative to the location of target. The 
speed of two motor follows such a computation so that the 
vehicle can move towards the location of target. If the 
vehicle deviates from direction of target, the value of 
vector product is used to determine whether the vehicle is 
on the left or right side of the target and then judge 
whether obstacles exist around the vehicle. Suppose there 
is obstacle on the left/right sides of the vehicle, it will 
move along the edge of obstacle. Suppose the obstacle is 
in the front, the vehicle turns 90 degrees towards the 
target. The sensor data collected by micro-controller 
updates every one second. Suppose the GPS position data 
is unable to be acquired, within one second, the GPS is 
considered as invalid. Then, IMU is utilized to calculate 
vehicle position. If the GPS signal can be acquired within 
three seconds, the vector-based navigation algorithm can 
be calculated. Fig. 3 demonstrates the process of 
navigation program. Firstly, the initial parameters of 
location is set up and the error radius of target location is 
determined. Then, it determine whether GPS signal is 
invalid, calculate vehicle position, whether vehicle detects 
colored object, whether the direction deviates and whether 
obstacles exist. The internal program process can be 
adjusted using external control.  
 
Vector-based navigation 
When the microcontroller receives GPS signal, the 
latitude and longitude degree of vehicle on the ground can 
be obtained, which is considered as a position ( , )Gk k kP x y  
in two dimension space. The ( 1) thk+ −  GPS latitude and

EXPERIMENT SETUP AND RESULTS 
 
The developed software/hardware is not quite stable. Thus, 
each sensor module needs to be tested to see if it can 
properly operate priori to its integration to basic stamp 
module set. After the testing, the BASIC Stamp modules, 
GPS module, gyroscope, accelerometer, ultrasonic, 
infrared sensor, color sensor, notebook and power 
converter module are all integrated to the vehicle. After, 
the testing of each component, the actual testing begins.  
 
The testing is conducted on spacious ground and self-
made field, respectively. Figure 6 shows two experiment 
fields. On spacious ground, the vehicle moves around the 
rectangular grass in front of department building in 
National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, 
Taiwan. The circumference is 270 m, with A as start point 
and B as end point. In this experiment, the length and 
width of the grass as well as night points are measured in 
advance. Then, the path is planned with these points 
known a priori. The vehicle moves clockwise based on 
the planned path with each corner of 90 degrees. Because 
the GPS positioning error allows about 10~13 m, the 
vehicle is unable to reach the planned point accurately. It 
must set a range to determine if it reaches target point and 
the error radius is 4.5 m. Suppose the vehicle is within 
range of target point, it is considered as reaching the 
target and will move towards next point. Once the 
traveled distance reaches the set length, it make turns, 
which is shown in Fig. 7.  
 
The purpose of this experiment is to test the moving track 
of vehicle simply using IMU component, or GPS plus 
compass module. In the setup of experiment parameter, 
the sampling time of GPS module, accelerometer, and 
gyroscope is 1 Hz. Fig. 7 illustrates that the single 
adoption of GPS and electronic compass results in the 
maximum positions error. The error of single use of IMU 
module is within fixed range and it shows the tendency of 
increase. The reason is because the bias of sensor 
component, white noise and scale factor lead to 
accumulated error and make the positioning error 
gradually increase. After several testings, the acceleration 
vector and direction angle of electronic compass multiply 
with scale factor and add to bias, show in Fig. 8. Odometry

Figure 6. Experiment field. (a) Scenario 1; (b) Self-made field 
 
is utilized to calculate the traveled distance of vehicle. It 
is obvious that the positioning precision has been 
improved.   
 
The second experiment is conducted on field and the 
vehicle is able to spray, identify colored object when it 
moves. When the vehicle detects the object, it stops and 
sprays on the object using sprayer. During its movement, 
the vehicle goes wall-following based on planned path. 
Colored objects will be placed on planned path to test the 
detection performance of vehicle. Because the experiment 
is conducted on tiny field, it does not employ GPS and 
IMU modules. It simply adopts ultrasonic, infrared, 
odometry, and color sensor. Fig 9. demonstrates the 
planned path and vehicle route. The figure shows that the 
vehicle stays where the colored object is and starts to 
spray.

Spatial Cooperative Diversity Technique in

Abstract— This paper aims to develop spatial cooperative 
diversity techniques to proceed with the switch, selection, 
combination and optimization between antennas. The 
mathematical formulations of spatial cooperative diversity 
techniques in term of equal-gain and maximum-ratio combining 
methods are also demonstrated. After successful testing of the 
algorithms through simulated data, it has been found that the 
proposed technique presents a significant improvement in terms 
of post-processing signal to noise ratio (post-SNR) and detection 
probability in contrast to  single antenna-based Global 
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver. 
 
Keywords-GNSS; beamforming; antenna array 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
With the development of numerous wireless 
communication techniques, the environment is immersed in 
radio wave. The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) 
that depends on radio wave for positioning may render the 
receiver unable to effectively lock carrier frequency and code 
phase once the signal is susceptible to interference, which 
leads to positioning error. The indoor positioning of global 
positioning system (GPS) is more difficult when the signal 
power is deteriorated by multipath effect [1]. To improve the 
quality of indoor positioning, scholars have proposed many 
methods and antenna array technique is one of them [2]. This 
technique utilizes the spatial orientation of signal, strengthens 
signal reception power and eliminates interference through 
direction of beamforming method. Moreover, it provides 
spatial diversity and enhances transmission rate by receiving 
multi-antennas. This paper proposes a spatial cooperative 
diversity and decision logic to adaptively select certain or 
multi-antennas equipped on platform for useful signal fusion 
and post-processing. This technique can also be applied to 
indoor positioning and reduce the risk of deteriorated 
positioning performance of GPS signal due to noise and co-
channel interference. 
II. SIGNAL MODEL 
Assume the thl−  satellite signal of array-type receiver at 
0 th−  antenna location is converted to intermediate frequency 
(IF) and its mathematical equation is written as follows: 
[ ] ( ) ( )cos(( ) ) [ ]m m m ml l l s l s l D ss n = P d nT Ĳ C nT Ĳ f f nT Ĳ ș w n+ +- - - -  
(1) 
The notation [ ] ( )ss n s nT= ҏis used to denote a digital sequence 
sampled at frequency (1 )s sf / T n= ⋅  where n  is the discrete 
time index and sT  is the sampling rate. 0 ml lĲ Ĳ Ĳ= -  stands for 
the arrival time delay between 0 and thm −  antenna. 0lĲ  and 
m
lĲ  indicate the delay time, respectively, of thl−  signal 
arriving at reference antenna 0 and thm −  antenna. Note that 
0l =  is the mathematical expression of desired signal, 
1l ,....,L=  indicates 1L−  co-channel interference signals and 
multipath in total, lP  denotes the power of thl−  receivedʳ
signal, ( )d ⋅  represents 50 Hz navigation message data and 
( )C ⋅  stands for the simulated code of 1023 in length. lf  and 
Df , respectively, are the IF and Doppler frequency expressed 
in units of rad/sˁ ș  denotes the phase error, and w  is channel 
noise where power distribution is assumed to far exceed 
bandwidth of IF signal and the power density of noise is 
0 2N /  with average as zero. 0N  indicates noise density of 
single sideband. Various antenna combinations are utilized to 
promote signal acquisition performance. The following will 
introduce different spatial cooperative diversity techniques.  
III. SPATIAL COOPERATIVE DIVERSITY TECHNIQUES 
Traditional diversity technique is often utilized in multi-
input and multi-output (MIMO) communication system to 
promote the communication quality for users. Space-time 
wireless system has been proposed by scholar Bolcskei for 
discussion in 2006 [3]. However, the application of this 
technique to GNSS positioning is still at its initial stage. The 
basic concept is to employ multi-antennas to receive different 
space information, each of which is processed through signal 
processing technique to effectively promote post-processing 
signal to noise ratio (post-SNR). Spatial diversity is also 
known as diversity antennas or antenna diversity. What 
matters the most in spatial diversity is the arrangement of 
multiple antennas to receive multiple signals with uncorrelated 
fading and the subsequent signal combining at the receiver. 
Each of multiple antennas is separated spatially to achieve 
independent fading paths. The relative phase of the multipath 
signal is obviously different at both antennas because of the 
spatial separation, i.e. antenna spacing, between two antennas. 
Assume the received signal envelopes for the two antennas are

data of all antennas to output. However, the summed signal 
may appear incoherent due to the inconsistent signal phase of 
each antenna. Thus, the rear of each antenna is multiplied by a 
phase compensator to render the received signal phase 
coherent. Fig. 2(d) shows the diagram of equal gain 
combining. EG combining is a special case of the maximum 
ratio combining. The antenna weights are set as one. 
Consequently, there is no need to adjust the weight of the 
individual signals before adding them, which indicates that all 
the antenna signals are weighed equally in spite of their SNRs.

combining, M  input signal after de-spreading denoted as My  
received via M  diversity received channels are considered. 
Such a binary hypothesis test results in likelihood ratioʳ test 
(LRT) as the additive noise is zero mean Gaussian one. The 
LRT for an antenna diversity structure including M  received 
channels can be considered as received signalʳ estimator 
followedʳby a correlator.ʳWhen the correlation coefficient Dρ  
between received signals in various channels is less than 0.5, 
the detector serves as EG combiner. In this work, the equal 
gain combiner is utilized to combine received signals through 
different channels in each diversity systems.  
V. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, a simple example is utilized to present the 
performance of different antenna combinations. The antenna 
array is mounted on a circular motion table. Simulations are 
carried out under the Matlab environment. The four antennas 
are distributed equally on circular plate where 0.5 m is the 
lever arm from the center of gravity of the platform to the 
center of the antenna ring, and each of the antenna blanking 
angle is 15D . It assumes coherent integration time as 3 ms and 
non-coherent integration time as 8 ms. The simulation data is

sampled at 16.368 MHz with an IF of 4.092 MHz, where IF 
bandwidth is 4 MHz.ʳThe received Rayleigh fading channel is 
composed of co-channel interference, desired signals, and 
noise. The collected data includes 250 ms of data samples and 
the total co-channel interference to noise ratio (CINR) is 15 
dB. The observable GPS satellites are depicted in the sky plot 
of Fig. 4. Eight GPS satellites are observed. Fig. 5 illustrates 
the squared magnitude envelope correlation as a function of 
antenna spacing and the theoretical curve. This figure also 
demonstrates that the measured antenna envelope correlation 
is generally lower than the theoretical correlation curve, 
particularly for a smaller antenna spacing. This is because the 
indoor patch antenna adopted in this paper is not an ideal one; 
and the radiation pattern of the indoor patch antenna is not 
omni-directional. 
The difference in performance between single antenna and 
diversity antennas has been indicated in Fig. 6 and this 
performance improvement is owing to the diversity gain with 
spatial signal combining. The figure illustrates that different 
antenna cooperative diversity techniques can effectively 
improve signal detection probability. The signal detectionʳ
performance enhances the most, especially in using BF [8] in 
indoor environment (Rayleigh fading). However, the priori 
knowledge is required for the BF method to deal with the 
detection and mitigation co-channel interference.ʳ Fig. 7 
describes the average post-SNR for different combining 
methods as a function of non-coherent integration time (fading 
channel). This figure illustrates that the use of diversity 
antennas provides more post-SNR compared to SC.ʳHowever, 
SW combining provides slightly improved performance in 
contrast to SC combining regarding post-SNRʳgain.

Abstract—This paper proposes the multiplexing technique 
that combines signal detector, decision logic, and anti-J modules 
to counteract narrowband continuous wave interference and 
spoofing signal in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) 
receivers. The signal detector is to detect the presence of 
different types of jammers. The decision logic is utilized to select 
different anti-jam strategies against jammers. Effective carrier 
to noise ratio (C/No) is employed to assess the performance of 
proposed scheme. Through the establishment of mathematical 
model and simulation results, the proposed scheme can 
effectively detect and mitigate jammers so that the positioning 
performance of GNSS receivers will not be contaminated. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
N eye-catching statement in BBC News Report states 
that “Technology that depends on satellite-navigation 
signals is increasingly threatened by attack from widely 
available equipment, experts say [1].” How to effectively 
counteract these attacks and defend global navigation satellite 
system (GNSS) from the effect of interference is the current 
concern of scholars and experts. The internal code design of 
civilian GNSS receiver is coarse/acquire-code (C/A-code) 
instead of precise-code (P-code) of military type. Thus, the 
global positioning system (GPS) receiver is vulnerable to the 
spoof attack of hackers, extortionists, etc. To scope with 
intentional and unintentional interferences, the current 
techniques used to mitigate interferences consist of three 
types: antenna array techniques, pre-correlation, and 
post-correlation techniques. Though these techniques can 
efficiently mitigate many types of interference such as 
narrowband, wideband and pulse, deeper thoughts and 
strategies are required to deal with counterfeited GPS signal 
[2, 3]. It is declared in Volpe Report that “A spoofer also can 
defeat nearly all anti-jamming equipment [4].” Spoofing is 
more hazardous than jamming because jamming causes the 
service to deteriorate in performance while spoofing takes 
command of the receiver and then injects misleading 
information. Such an impact can not be ignored. For instance, 
the local area augmentation system (LAAS) developed in 
America often utilizes pseudolite satellites set up by the 
ground stations to obtain high position dilution of precision 
(PDOP) during navigation. However, the effect on aviation is 
hazardous once the pseudolite (pseudo satellite) are abused to 
broadcast misleading navigation information. 
In 1995, several concepts for countering spoofing had been 
 
Manuscript received September 22, 2010. This work was supported in part 
by the National Science Council under Grant NSC 99-2221-E-020 -036.

proposed by Edwin L. key, such as amplitude discrimination, 
time-of-arrival discrimination, polarization discrimination, 
and cryptographic authentication, etc. [5]. The author 
considers that the adoption of multiple element antenna may 
be the best anti-spoofing technique to measure the angle of 
arrival (AOA) of all received signals. The spoofer are easily 
rejected because it is very difficult for a spoofer to match the 
AOA of satellite signals. In recent year, this technique has 
been implemented and often applied to interference 
mitigation of GNSS military navigation. The mitigation 
methods regarding near-field pseudolite and co-channel 
interference have been subsequently proposed. These 
methods can effectively mitigate pseudolite signals with 
stronger power to avoid its effect on navigation positioning. 
The cooperation of this method with effective interference 
detection and early warning mechanism, it will be rather 
helpful for future navigation system. 
This paper utilizes adaptive antenna array technique in 
combination with signal acquisition and decision logic to 
constitute spoofing signal (SPS) detection and mitigation (or 
cancellation) system in order to safeguard the current GNSS 
receivers against spoof attack and secure GNSS-based 
positioning. Besides, this system also incorporates 
narrowband continuous wave interference (CWI) detection 
and mitigation technique to consolidate the reliability of 
interference mitigation performance for this system.   
II. METHODOLOGY 
This paper combines signal detection, decision logic and 
mitigation technique to counteract CWI and spoofing signal. 
A block diagram of the proposed algorithm is shown in Fig. 1, 
and it consists of three mechanisms, which are anti-J module, 
signal detector and decision logic module. The decision logic 
module can conduct different processing mode based on the 
“flag” sent by signal detector.  
Without spoofing signal or CWI, the receiver remains in 
initial mode to conduct signal acquisition and tracking. Under 
the situation of no interference, the internal signal processing 
of receiver performs three modes. Mode 1 is termed “Hold 
Mode”, where the receiver remains the same operation as it 
did. Mode 2 is called “Anti-CWI Mode”, where the received 
signals are processed by a CWI excisor. Mode 3 is termed 
“Anti-SPS Mode”, where the received samples of 
multi-channel are processed through anti-SPS module. After 
the operation of mode 2 and mode 3, the output of module is 
ultimately processed through signal correlation.  
In addition, knowledge database provides the useful 
information to enhance the performance of anti-J module and

The above equation can evaluate the performance of

2)  CWI Detection 
According to the lower power of GNSS signal which is 
below the noise floor, it is greatly helpful to detect CWI. In 
general, the power of CWI is higher than the noise. Thus, if 
the input signal is converted to frequency domain, it can 
monitor whether CWI exists. To avoid extra FFT 
computation load, we can meanwhile monitor whether CWI 
exists during signal acquisition. The CWI alarm flag 
( FLAGCWI ) is set to one. Otherwise, it is set to zero. The rule 
of detection is shown as follows:

anti-SPS mode. The procedure of anti-CWI module is firstly 
demonstrated in the following.  
1) Anti-CWI Module  
The anti-CWI module is performed while the decision 
logic module switch to mode 2. The function of this module is 
firstly to demodulate the carrier component and then 
transform to frequency domain by performing the FFT 
operator. Finally, the excision method is utilized to remove 
the partial interference component. Each frequency cell is 
compared to the threshold and if that exceeds the threshold, 
its value is held at the threshold [12]. 
2) Anti-SPS Module 
The incoming signals are received through the antenna 
arrays. The optimal adaptive weights are computed using the 
block adaptive spatial beamforming algorithm. The 
measurement data are multiplied by the adaptive weights and 
summed up to give the output for acquisition/tracking 
applications [13]. 
III. SIMULATION RESULT  
Consider the 2x2 uniform rectangular array (URA) 
where the antenna locations are distributed uniform on the 
XY plane with a radius of half-wavelength spacing. The 
proposed technique conduct the Matlab software and YUMA 
data to construct the real environment of GNSS signal 
reception. The raw data length is 600 ms with the sampling 
frequency is 16.368 MHz and digital IF as 4.092 MHz. The 
navigation data bit is removed from the record data. Fig. 3

l ll PR LNτ=∑ = 20 dB-Hz and 
power of spoofing term 2 spoof1 0 10( / ) ( )P N R τ = 38.2 dB-Hz. 
Assume that the direction of SPS and CWI are unknown to 
the system. Fig. 4 demonstrates the relation between different 
I/No and signal detection probability under fixed frequency 
of CWI. The false alarm rate is set as 0.005. Note that the 
value of signal detection probability decreases rapidly when 
the 0/I N  is above 25 dB and CWI is present.  
After the anti-CWI processing, the probability of signal 
detection maintains between 0.78 and 0.82. Fig. 5 shows that 
the adoption of proposed technique with anti-SPS and 
anti-CWI process ensures the effective C/No to keep 42.8 dB 
(authentic PRN 13). In addition, due to the presence of CWI, 
the 0/C N  decreases rapidly at 70 ms. The FLAGCWI  changes 
form zero to one. The decision logic module switches to 
anti-CWI module in mode 2. The module utilizes frequency 
excision method to remove the peak of interference in 
frequency domain. 
After this process, the FLAGCWI  changes to zero at 100 ms. 
Then, the decision logic starts the anti-SPS module in mode 3. 
At 110 ms, the signal detector can identify the SPS and then 
the beamforming algorithm is performed. Thus, the 0/C N  of 
real navigation signal increases up to 42.8 dB and 
FLAGSPS 0=  at 210 ms. It is worth note the the anti-CWI and 
anti-SPS module performs the anti-jam function normally

IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, a simple multiplex technique has been 
applied to anti-jam system to deal with the simultaneous 
presence of various types of interference. The simulation 
results illustrate that with the application of this technique, 
the SPS and CWI are effectively removed. Moreover, 
regarding detection and processing of SPS, the proposed 
technique can safeguard the receiver form receiving spoofing 
signal and avoid positioning error. This technique can be 
applied to future GNSS receiver design.

3. 實驗測試 
    本實驗測試地點位於屏東縣內埔鄉屏東科技大學生
物機電工程系館內，地理位置在東經 120.6 度，北緯 22.64
度，實驗時間在台北時間 8 月 28 日下午 4:00 分，當時
天空衛星分佈圖以及實驗場地如圖 5 與圖 6 所示。實驗
中分別將天線組中心點以等距的方式將各天線距離中心
點 9 公分、20 公分、40 公分以及 50 公分配置，利用此
配置分為靜態接收與動態接收兩方面進行，靜態接收資
料長度為 20 秒，動態旋轉轉數各為 1、4、20 rpm，當天
線組旋轉一周時即停止接收。將接收完成後的訊號資料
透過 MATLAB 軟體模擬程式進行訊號擷取與追蹤測
試。圖 7 顯示在距離 50 公分，轉數為 1 prm 情況下，利
用等效功率法所獲得同分相訊號解調結果。表一說明利
用不同合作分集方式所獲得的訊號擷取結果，其中 SAM
代表訊號擷取範圍，定義為相關運算最高峰值與平均值
之差，單位為 dB。從表格可得知，在靜態實驗中，透過
波束合成的方式，在天線彼此距離為 9 公分的情況下可
以增加整體訊號擷取性能約 1.5dB，最大 SNR 切換法可
彌補某組天線無法成功擷取衛星訊號的情況下可以有不
錯的 SMR 表現。而在動態實驗中，1RPM 的情況下，間
距 50 公分，利用最大 SNR 切換法可有效提升訊號擷取
品質，但旋轉速度增加至 4RPM 時，則是等效功率法有
最佳的訊號擷取結果，值得注意的是轉數增加至 20rpm
時，每種方法所獲得的訊號擷取結果皆無法有效獲得良
好的品質，初步判斷其原因在於轉速過快，以致訊號擷
取過程中無法進行同步的處理。 
4. 結論 
從實驗結果可得知，天線間距在大於 1/2 波長(9cm)
時，對於使用循序切換法、最大 SNR 切換法、等效功率
法皆有不錯的訊號擷取結果，但在間距 9cm 的情況下，
使用波束合成法為最佳方式。在天線平行旋轉時，天線
間距 50 公分時，使用最大功率切換則會有最佳的訊號擷
取性能表現，但如轉速過快(超過 20rpm)，則所有方式皆
會失效，造成訊號擷取失敗。
