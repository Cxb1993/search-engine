tive learning control for large-scale nonlinear systems with
nonlinear interconnections.
In this project, we aim to propose a fuzzy system based
control algorithm to solve the decentralized adaptive iter-
ative learning control problem of nonlinear systems with
nonlinear interconnections. The interconnection between
each subsystem can be a general unknown nonlinear func-
tion without satisfying the input matching condition. Un-
der a bounding condition on the nonlinear interconnec-
tions, the proposed decentralized adaptive fuzzy iterative
learning controller can guarantee the closed loop stabil-
ity and error convergence for all the iterations. The main
structure of each local learning controller is constructed by
a fuzzy learning component and a robust learning compo-
nent. For the fuzzy learning component, we design a fuzzy
system as an approximator to compensate for the plant
nonlinearities and interconnections. For the robust learn-
ing component, we apply a sliding-mode like strategy to
overcome the nonlinear state dependent input gain. Both
components are designed based on a time-varying bound-
ary layer which is introduced not only to solve the problem
of initial state errors but also to eliminate the possible un-
desirable chattering behavior. Since the optimal param-
eters for a good fuzzy approximation are in general un-
available and the desired bounding parameters for robust
learning might be too large, all the fuzzy and bounding
parameters will be tuned during the iteration processes.
Adaptive algorithms are derived via a Lyapunov-like anal-
ysis for this iterative learning controller to search for suit-
able fuzzy parameters and robust parameters. The adap-
tive laws, which combine time domain and iteration do-
main adaptation, relax the typical requirement of projec-
tion mechanism in the ﬁeld of adaptive iterative learning
control [14, 15, 20, 21]. Under this decentralized adaptive
fuzzy learning controller, we show that the norm of track-
ing error vector will asymptotically converge to a tunable
residual set. Furthermore, all adjustable parameters as
well as internal signals remain bounded.

In this section, we consider a repeatable interconnected
system with the ith nonlinear subsystem, i = 1, · · · , N ,
represented as
x˙ki,1(t) = x
k
i,2(t)
x˙ki,2(t) = x
k
i,3(t)
...
x˙ki,ni(t) = −fi(Xki (t)) + bi(Xki (t))uki (t)
−di(Xk(t)) (1)
where Xki (t) = [x
k
i,1(t), · · · , xki,ni(t)] ∈ Rni is the state
vector of the ith subsystem; uki (t) ∈ R1 is the control
input; fi(Xki (t)) and bi(X
k
i (t)) are the unknown contin-
uous functions of states; di(Xk(t)) denotes the interac-
tion term, and Xk(t) = [Xk1 (t)
, · · · , XkN(t)] ∈ Rn
is the state vector of the interconnected system with
n =
∑N
i=1 ni. Here, the index k represents the num-
ber of iteration. Suppose the nonlinear interconnected
system can perform a given task repeatedly over a ﬁ-
nite time interval [0, T ]. The control objective is to force
the state vector Xki (t) = [x
k
i,1(t), x
k
i,2(t), · · · , xki,ni (t)] =
[xki,1(t), x˙
k
i,1(t), · · · , x(ni−1),ki,1 (t)] of each subsystem to fol-
low some speciﬁed desired bounded vector Xi,d(t) =
[xi,d(t), x˙i,d(t), · · · , x(ni−1)i,d (t)], for all i = 1, · · · , N and
t ∈ [0, T ] as close as possible when the numbers of learning
in iteration domain are large enough. In order to achieve
the control objective, some assumptions on each nonlinear
subsystem and interconnections are given as follows :
(A1) The nonlinear functions fi(Xki (t)), bi(X
k
i (t)) and
interaction di(Xk(t)) are bounded if Xki (t), i =
1, · · · , N is bounded.
(A2) There exists positive unknown constants bLi , i =
1, · · · , N such that 0 < bLi ≤ bi(Xki (t)) for all Xki (t)
in a certain controllable compact set Ac ⊂ Rni and
for all iterations k ≥ 1.
(A3) There exist an unknown positive number ζ∗i0 and un-
known smooth functions ζi,j(|skφj (t)|) , j = 1,· · · , N
such that |di(Xk(t))| ≤ ζi0+
∑N
j=1 ζi,j(|skφj (t)|). The
auxiliary ﬁltered error, skφi(t), will be deﬁned later.
(A4) Let the state errors eki,1(t), · · · , eki,ni(t) be deﬁned as
eki,1(t) = x
k
i,1(t) − xd(t), eki,2(t) = x˙ki,1(t) − x˙d(t),
· · · , eki,ni(t) = x
(ni−1),k
i,1 (t) − x(ni−1)d (t). The initial
state errors at each iteration are not necessarily zero,
small and ﬁxed, but assumed to be bounded.
For the system to be controllable on the compact set Ac,
the existence of a lower bound for bi(Xki (t)) is assumed
in assumption (A2). This is almost a necessary condition
for most of the researches dealing with the similar con-
trol problem in iteration domain [14, 15, 21] or in time
domain [10, 12, 13, 18, 19]. However, bi(Xki (t)) and its
lower bound bLi are allowed to be unknown in this project.
The constraint on the interaction nonlinearity of intercon-
nected parts is given in assumption (A3), which is similar
to the assumption given in [18]. It is noted that the non-
linear interconnections are also allowed to be unknown.
Finally, assumption (A4) is the condition for initial state
errors. In general, they can be large and varying in itera-
tion domain.
In order to illustrate the idea of the proposed learning
control scheme, we use the following four steps to explain
the design approach.
Step 1. We ﬁrst deﬁne a ﬁltered error as follows :
ski (t) = ci,1e
k
i,1(t) + · · ·+ ci,ni−1eki,ni−1(t) + eki,ni(t) (2)
where ci,1, · · · , ci,ni−1 are the coeﬃcients of a Hurwitz
polynomial ∆i(D) = Dni−1 + ci,ni−1Dni−2 + · · · + ci,1.
It is clear that if lim
k→∞
ski (t) = 0 for all i = 1, · · · , N , and
t ∈ [0, T ], then the state tracking errors of each subsystem
will also asymptotically converge to zero for all t ∈ [0, T ].
2
important aspect of the above approximation property is
that there exist optimal weights W ∗i such that the func-
tion approximation error between the optimal fuzzy sys-
tem F̂ (Y ki (t),W
∗
i ) and function Fi(Y
k
i (t)) can be bounded
by a prescribed constant ∗i on the compact set Ac. More
precisely, if we let Fi(Y ki (t)) = F̂i(Y
k
i (t),W
∗
i )+ i(Y
k
i (t)),
then the approximation error will satisfy |i(Y ki (t))| ≤ ∗i ,
∀Y ki (t) ∈ Ac.
In this step, a fuzzy learning control Uki,FL(t) based on
the fuzzy system is proposed to compensate for the nonlin-
earity Fi(Y ki (t)) which will be deﬁned later and a robust
learning control Uki,RL(t) based on sliding mode like strat-
egy is designed to compensate for the input gain bi(Xki (t)),
respectively. Both of the iterative learning control com-
ponents are speciﬁed as follows :
Uki,FL(t) = F̂i(Y
k
i (t),W
k
i (t)) − sat
(
ski (t)
φki (t)
)
ψki (t)
(11)
Uki,RL(t) = −sat
(
ski (t)
φki (t)
)(
θki (t) + 1
) |Uki,a(t)| (12)
where W ki (t) ∈ Rmi×1 is the fuzzy parameter vector of the
given fuzzy system and ψki (t) ∈ R1, θki (t) ∈ R1 are deﬁned
as the bounding control parameters. All the parameters
will be tuned via some suitable adaptive laws in order
to ensure the closed-loop stability and convergence. To
explain the key point of the design concept in this step,
let us apply Uki,FL(t) and U
k
i,RL(t) to the error dynamic

Since ζi,j(|skφj (t)|) is a smooth function, there exist
smooth functions ξi,j(|skφj (t)|) such that ζi,j(|skφj (t)|) =
|skφj (t)| ξi,j(|skφj (t)|). Thus, using the facts that 2ab ≤

Step 4. Since the optimal fuzzy parameter vector for a
good function approximation and the optimal control pa-
rameters for robust control are in general unknown, the
estimated value W ki (t), ψ
k
i (t) and θ
k
i (t) at kth iteration
are used as on line parameters for time t. The adaptive
algorithms combining time domain and iteration domain
adaptation without knowledge of known bounds on opti-
mal parameters or deadzone mechanism are proposed as
follows:
(1 − γ1)W˙ik(t) = −γ1W ki (t) + γ1W k−1i (t)
− β1skφi(t)Zi(Y ki (t)) (16)
(1− γ2)ψ˙ik(t) = −γ2ψki (t) + γ2ψk−1i (t)

(1− γ3)θ˙ik(t) = −γ3θki (t) + γ3θk−1i (t)

with W ki (0) = W

i (T ), θ
k
i (0) =
θk−1i (T ) for k ≥ 1, and 0 < γ1, γ2, γ3 < 1, β1, β2, β3 > 0.
In these adaptive laws, γ1, γ2, γ3 and β1, β2, β3 are deﬁned
as the weighting gains and adaptation gains, respectively.
The initial fuzzy parameter vector W 0i (t) = W
ini
i will be
set according to any expert knowledge on the nonlinear
function Fi(Xki (t)) or simply to be zero vector. On the
other hand, the initial control parameters ψ0i (t), θ

be chosen as ψ0i (t) = ψ

the diﬀerence between V k(T ) and V k−1(T ) can be derived

(28)
If we deﬁne V kb (t) =

the following inequality by using the same argument of

gives

where we use the property of V kb (0) =

Substituting (29) into (28), it yields

Since V 1(T ) is bounded by lemma 1, and V k(T ) is positive
and monotonically decreasing, V k(T ) is bounded for all
k ≥ 1 and will converge as k approaches inﬁnity to some
limit value VT (independent of k). The boundedness of
V k(T ) also ensures the boundedness of W˜ ki (T ), ψ˜
k
i (T ) and
θ˜ki (T ) for all k ≥ 1 and i = 1, · · · , N . Furthermore, (30)
implies

erations is then established. Finally, as lim
k→∞
V k−1(T ) −
V k(T ) = 0, it concludes (25) and (26) of lemma 2. Q.E.D.
Theorem 1. Consider the problem set-up in lemma 1
and deﬁne Eki (t) = [e
k
i,1(t), e

(t4) Let Ci = [ci,1, · · · , ci,ni−1 ] and δ be the positive con-
stant such that ∆(D − δ) is still a Hurwitz polyno-
mial, then for some positive constant mi we have

Proof :
(t1) Integrating (23) from 0 to t, we have
V ka (t) ≤ V ka (0) +
∫ t
0
λk−1(t′)dt′
≤ V ka (0) +
∫ T

λk−1(t)dt (32)
Since V k(T ), deﬁned in (27), is bounded ∀k ≥ 1 ac-
cording to the proof of lemma 2, we conclude that∫ T
0 λ
k−1(t)dt is bounded ∀k ≥ 1. Furthermore, the
initial value V ka (0) is also bounded for all k ≥ 1
due to lemma 2. This readily implies from (32)
that V ka (t) and hence, skφi(t), W˜
k

(t2) According to (t1) of this theorem, we have (skφi(t))
2 ∈
L∞e[0, T ] and ddt (s

k
i (t) −
sgn(skφi(t))φ˙
k
i (t)) ∈ L∞e[0, T ] for all k ≥ 1. These
facts imply that (skφi(t))
2 is uniformly continuous
over [0, T ] for all k ≥ 1. On the other hand, (skφi(t))2
satisﬁes limk→∞
∫ T
0
(skφi(t))
2dt = 0 due to (25) of
lemma 2. We can now conclude, by using Barbalat’s
lemma that lim
k→∞
(skφi(t))
2 = 0 for all i = 1, · · · , N
and t ∈ [0, T ].
