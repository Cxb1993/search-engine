Abstract 
 
In wireless/mobile networks, users freely change their service points, while they are 
communicating with other users. In order to support the mobility of mobile nodes, 
Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) is proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force, in which a 
mobile node must inform its home agent the binding of its home address and the current 
care-of-address (CoA). The home agent forwards packets to CoA when it receives 
packets for the mobile node.  
There is a significant problem in MIPv6 due to its inability to support micromobility 
caused by long delays and high packet losses during a handoff. Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 
(HMIPv6) is proposed to separate mobility into micromobility [within one domain or 
within the same mobility anchor point (MAP)] and macromobility (between domains or 
between MAPs). HMIPv6 reduces handoff latency by employing a hierarchical network 
structure and minimizing the location update signaling with external network. The 
two-layer network structure of HMIPv6 is very suitable for supporting the vertical 
handoff and the horizontal handoff in wireless overlay networks. Wireless overlay 
networks can consist of two layers. Functions of access routers can be implemented in 
low-layer networks and functions of MAPs can be implemented in high-layer networks. 
Or we can have an access router collocated with a low-layer network and an MAP 
collocated with a high-layer network. In either way, the micromobility in HMIPv6 is 
equal to the horizontal handoff in wireless overlay networks and the macromobility in 
HMIPv6 is equal to the vertical handoff in wireless overlay networks. However, a 
significant delay still occurs in macromobility management. 
 This paper considers handover operations. We analyze the handoff delay and find that 
the DAD time represents a large portion of handoff delay.We also note that we can assign 
a unique on-link care-of address (LCoA) to each mobile node and switch between 
one-layer IPv6 and two-layer IPv6 addressing. By this way, we propose a Stealth-time 
HMIP (SHMIP) which can reduce the effect of the DAD time on the handoff delay and, 
thus, reduce the handoff time significantly. To further reduce packet losses, we also adopt 
prehandoff notification to request previous MAP to buffer packets for the mobile node. 
By simulations, we show 
that the proposed scheme can realize low handoff delays and low packet losses during 
macromobility.

location or signal strength for better handling handoffs are considered in [18], [19]. Fast 
handover protocol [10], [20] is an extension of Mobile IPv6 that allows an access router 
to offer service to a mobile node (MN) in order to anticipate the L3 handoff and start the 
handoff earlier. We focus on the modification of hierarchical Mobile IPv6 to support fast 
handoff by reducing the influence of duplication address detection (DAD), because we 
find the DAD time represents a large portion of delay time in a handoff. We note that we 
can assign a unique on-link care-of address (LCoA) to each mobile node and switch 
between one-layer IPv6 and two-layer IPv6 addressing. By this way, we propose a 
Stealth-time HMIP (SHMIP) which can reduce the effect of the DAD time on the handoff 
delay and, thus, reduce the handoff time significantly. To further reduce packet losses, we 
also adopt prehandoff notification to request previous MAP to buffer packets for the 
mobile node. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we 
explain various kinds of delays during a handoff, introduce the HMIPv6 protocol, and 
describe the process of autoconfiguration of IPv6 addresses. In Section III, we propose 
and discuss our Stealth-time HMIPv6 (SHMIPv6) scheme. Simulation results are 
presented in Section IV. Conclusion is in Section V. 
 
 
 
 
II. Background on Handoff Latency, HMIPv6, and 
Autoconfiguration[21]–[24] 
 
This section provides a brief introduction of various kinds of delays during a 
handoff, the HMIPv6 scheme, and the process of autoconfiguration of IPv6 addresses. 
 
A. Handoff Latency 
 
A mobile node cannot receive IP packets on its new point of attachment until the 
handoff ends. This time is called handoff latency. There are several components of 
handoff procedure that cause handoff latency in Mobile IPv6 [25], [26]. These 
components of latency are the following.  
 
 Link-layer establishment delay: It takes a short time for the physical interface 
of the MN to change its single connection from the old access router to the 
newaccess router.  
 
 The rendezvous time delay: This delay time taken for an mobile node to hear 
beacons from a new access router after roaming out of the old access router’s 
network [27], [28] 
 
 Registration delay: This delay time starts in the moment that the mobile node 
sends a binding update (BU) to the new access router and finishes when the 
first packet arrives via the new router, either from the home agent, 
correspondent node or access router. Fig. 1 is typical values of each component 
in a handoff. It shows that DAD is a major portion in the total handoff delay. 
 
 
Fig. 2. HMIPv6. 
 
 
Step 1) When a mobile node decides to initiate a link-layer handoff, its IP layer 
sends a “set handoff request” to link layer. When the “set handoff request” is 
received, the link layer responds with a “link up notification” to IP layer. 
 
Step 2) The mobile node sends a “router solicitation” to the new access router and 
waits for a ”router advertisement.” When the “router advertisement” from the new 
access router is received, its IP layer changes the default router to a new access 
router and configures its link-local address with a new IPv6 address by receiving a 
new router advertisement (RA), which is periodically sent by the access router. The 
RA includes LCoA and RCoA. Then, it performs DAD on its LCoA. If DAD check 
is successful, it may use either stateless or stateful address autoconfiguration to form 
its new LCoA. 
 
Step 3) Once the new LCoA construction is done, the mobile node must send a local 
“BU” (in Fig. 3) message to the MAP through the new access router to inform the 
MAP about its new binding of LCoA and RCOA. If the MAP accepts the “BU,” it 
must perform DAD on the mobile node’s RCoA and create a new entry in its 
binding cache for this mobile node, or update its existing binding cache entry if such 
an entry already exists. Then, MAP sends a “binding acknowledgment” [(BA) in Fig. 
3] to the mobile node through new access router. The acknowledgment is used to 
indicate that it has successfully received the mobile node’s “BU” and the address is 
not duplicated, or contains the fault code.  
 
Fig. 3. Exchanges of signals for macromobility in HMIPv6 routing scheme. 
 
Step 1) Create link-local address first. This address is formed by appending the 
interfaces identifier to the well-known link-local prefix.  
 
Step 2) Perform DAD in order to know whether there are other nodes that use the 
same address. If a duplicate address is discovered during the procedure, the address 
cannot be assigned. If the address is derived from an interface identifier, a new 
identifier will need to be assigned to the interface, or all IP addresses for the 
interface will need to be manually configured. 
 
Step 3) The mobile node sends a “router solicitation” and requires the router of the 
same link to reply with a “router advertisement.” 
 
Step 4) The mobile node can form IP address by combining the prefix of router 
advertisement and interface identifier. 
 
For example, in Fig. 4, the medium access control (MAC) address of a mobile node 
one-layer IP and two-layer IP addressing. In other words, before the operation 
of DAD for RCoA is complete, the LCoA is used for data transmission and two-layer IP 
addressing in HMIP are switched to one-layer IP addressing temporarily. In this way, we 
propose a Stealth-time HMIP (SHMIP) which can reduce the influence of DAD time and, 
thus, decrease the handoff time significantly.  
We know the delay comes from the transmission time of the signaling and the 
process of DAD check. In order to perform DAD (RFC 2462), the mobile node has to 
send one or several neighbor solicitation(s) to its new access router and wait for a 
response for as many as 1 s. During this operation, the mobile node cannot receive any 
packets.  
In order to solve this problem, we hope to utilize this period of time waiting for 
DAD. In the original mechanism of HMIPv6, we wait for the result of DAD because we 
cannot confirm the uniqueness of RCoA. Our mechanism is when a mobile node sends 
local “BU,” it also sends “BUs” to its home agent and correspondent node at the same 
time, using LCoA instead of RCoA.  
To maintain the advantage of HMIPv6, after DAD for RCoA is confirmed by new 
MAP, the mobile node sends a “BU” to its home agent and correspondent node again like 
in HMIPv6. Although registering to home agent and correspondent node by LCoA can 
reduce DAD time, there are still packet losses before “BU.” To further reduce packet 
losses, we also adopt “prehandoff notification” to request previous mobile access point 
(pMAP) to buffer packets for the mobile node [31]. When the mobile node acquires new 
LCoA, it sends a “BU” again to previous MAP to inform the MAP to terminate buffering 
and forward buffered packets to the mobile node. Since the operations of micromovement 
are the same as HMIPv6, we only describe the macromovement of SHMIPv6 here. 
 
B. Macromobility 
 
When a mobile node starts moving from pMAP network to new MAP network, several 
operations will be needed. Fig. 5 shows the exchanges of signaling for macromobility in 
HMIPv6 routing scheme. The signaling routing scheme for our proposal is described as 
follows.  
 
Step 1) Before level 2 (L2) handoff, the link layer of a mobile node sends a 
“prehandoff notification” to IP layer [32]. The mobile node sends a “BU” (in Fig. 5) 
to pMAP that specifies the binding (previous RCoA, pMAP’s address) after 
receiving a “prehandoff notification.” pMAP returns a “BA” (in Fig. 5) to the 
mobile node and starts buffering packets for the mobile node. Since the BU is to 
inform the pMAP to buffer packets for the mobile node and the previous RCoA 
address of the mobile node is valid, it is not necessary to perform DAD for the 
previous RCoA. 
 
Step 2) When the IP layer of the mobile node decides to initiate link layer handoff, it 
sends a “set handoff request” to link layer. When the “set handoff request” is 
received, link layer sends a “link up notification” to IP layer. The mobile node 
performs an L2 handoff from old access router to new access router.  
 
 
Fig. 5. Exchanges of signaling for macromobility in SHMIPv6 routing scheme. 
 
 
We can reduce DAD time and reduce packet losses by adding Step 1) and Step 4) 
while in macromovements. This will be further discussed in Section III-D. Other steps 
are the same as mechanisms of original HMIPv6. 
 
C. MAP Operations 
 
There is a cache in the MAP for recording the association of the LCoA of a mobile node 
with its RCoA. While the MAP intercepts any packet to the mobile node’s RCoA, it 
checks its binding cache first. If not in its binding cache, it forward the packet by normal 
route rule. Otherwise, it will intercept this packet, and tunnel the packet to the LCoA of 
 
Fig. 6. MAP operations. 
 
 
Fig. 7. Simulation architecture. 
 
If the previous MAP (pMAP) fails in step (1) of Fig. 5, the SHMIPv6 scheme 
simply begins with the step (2) without the “prehandoff notification.” If the pMAP fails 
during step (4) of Fig. 5, the MN node will not receive packets from pMAP and only 
receive packets from HA/CN, which is similar to the situation that the pMAP does not 
support buffering. If fails in step (5) of SHMIPv6 (step (3) of HMIPv6), it means we need 
more time to perform and . Equation (3) shows that our scheme will perform even better 
compared with HMIPv6. In step (4) of Fig. 5, the mobile node will receive packets both 
from pMAP and HA/CN. The problem of disordering can be greatly reduced by 
implementing buffering in the MN. A routing header extension is added to the buffered 
packet before it is sent from pMAP to the MN [33]. The router header extension contains 
the pMAP address while the source address in the IPv6 header has the HA/CN address, 
so the MN can differentiate the packets from pMAP and the packets from HA/CN. Once

Fig. 8. Comparison of macromobility handoff delay between HMIPv6 and SHMIPv6. 
 
Fig. 8 shows the macromobility handoff (vertical handoff) 
delay for both SHMIPv6 and HMIPv6 schemes. The typical 
wireless-link delay between the mobile node and access router is between 10 and 50 ms, 
depending on the channel condition and their distance. When the wireless-link delay 
between the mobile node and access router increases, the difference in macro- mobility 
handoff delay between two schemes also increases. In other words, the handoff delay in 
SHMIPv6 is not increased as quickly as HMIPv6. It shows that the SHMIPv6 scheme has

V.   Conclusion 
 
HMIPv6 is good in handling micromobility but still has relative long delay in 
managing macromobility. In this paper, a novel scheme, SHMIPv6, is proposed to 
improve the handoff performance of macromobility. The scheme utilizes the time period 
of DAD for RCoA by switching from two-layer addressing to one-layer addressing in 
that period. By analysis and by simulations, we showthat the SHMIPv6 has better 
performance compared to SHMIPv6 in terms of macromobility handoff delays and 
packet losses.
