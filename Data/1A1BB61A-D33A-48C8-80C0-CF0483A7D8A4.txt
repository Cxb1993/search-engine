英文摘要 
The objective of this project is to predict and characterize protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from sequence 
and evolution properties. There is great continuity between this project and the project leader’s previous NSC 
project, “Using protein solvent accessibility to predict protein-protein interaction.” To date, the project leader 
has finished a novel de novo PPI predictor. In addition, the limitations of de novo PPI prediction and the 
advantages/disadvantages compared to other kinds of approaches for PPI prediction have been 
comprehensively studied, especially for large-scale data of complete human protein interaction network. This 
project improves de novo PPI prediction as well as incorporates other PPI prediction algorithms of different 
types. Finally, a hybridization scheme is developed to combine multiple hetero-algorithms to achieve the best 
performance. 
From past studies, there are still some challenges for PPI analysis to achieve both correctness and 
completeness. The challenges come from two respects: the collection of non-interacting protein pairs and the 
construction of feature set. Since there is limited information to guarantee that two proteins never interact, the 
collection process of a PPI data set results in many false negative samples. On the other hand, involving data 
sources in addition to sequence information in the feature construction process largely decreases the 
practicability. Thus, many studies have suggested developing novel feature sets based on only protein primary 
sequences for PPI prediction. This limitation makes the prediction more difficult. 
This project plans to develop an algorithm of predicting PPI based on hybridizing hetero-algorithms, which 
designs a sophisticated scheme to exploits the advantages of individual components. Several improvement 
mechanisms are proposed for different kinds of methods and to provide better analyses to achieve both 
completeness and correctness. Finally, the results of prediction are integrated into a friendly web service 
providing automatic analysis of protein-protein interactions for biomedical researchers.

project leader’s specialty and accomplished works, this project presents a comprehensive framework to 
systematically enhance the PPI prediction. The backbone would be an advanced ML-based method. The short 
objective is enhancing current method and solving known issues. However, some native disadvantages must 
resort to other categories of methods. The objective during this period will become comprehensively survey 
and comparison of methods. This project will focus on the overlap and difference analyses of other methods to 
the ML-based one. The analyses will be performed in sample level to reveal that which group of interactions 
favors some methods, where the implementation of compared methods is required. These valuable 
information will be the base of how hybridizing distinct algorithms. Thus, the third part of this project is to 
balance these algorithms and construct a framework of PPI prediction. In addition to the hybridization scheme, 
how well such approaches work highly depends on the distinctness among the underlying components to 
combine. In this regard, this proposed method is promising since it aims at large-scale PPI prediction, which 
intensifies the differences among methods and fits the need of current trend in that field. 
文獻探討 
Protein-protein interaction 
Recent years have seen various experimental techniques for the systematic PPI analysis, including yeast 
two-hybrid (Y2H) (Fields and Song 1989; Ito, Chiba et al. 2001), coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) (Gavin, 
Bosche et al. 2002; Ho, Gruhler et al. 2002; Gavin, Aloy et al. 2006) and other approaches (Zhu, Bilgin et al. 
2001; Tong, Drees et al. 2002). The resulted interaction data is publicly available in several databases such as 
BIND (Bader, Betel et al. 2003), DIP (Salwinski, Miller et al. 2004), MIPS (Guldener, Munsterkotter et al. 
2006) and IntAct (Kerrien, Alam-Faruque et al. 2007). 
However, these experimentally detected interactions represent only a small fraction of the real PPI networks 
(Han, Dupuy et al. 2005; Hart, Ramani et al. 2006). A number of computational approaches have been 
proposed to supplement the time-consuming drawback of experimental techniques. Many of these methods 
require not only sequence information but also auxiliary data such as localization data (Pellegrini, Marcotte et 
al. 1999), structural data (Aloy and Russell 2002; Aloy and Russell 2003; Ogmen, Keskin et al. 2005), 
expression data (Enright, Iliopoulos et al. 1999; Marcotte, Pellegrini et al. 1999; Soong, Wrzeszczynski et al. 
2008) and/or interaction information of orthologs (Huang, Tien et al. 2004; Espadaler, Romero-Isart et al. 
2005). Several sequence-based algorithms have been developed to detect potential PPI pairs for which no 
auxiliary information are available (Bock and Gough 2001; Ben-Hur and Noble 2005; Chen and Liu 2005; Lo, 
Cai et al. 2005; Martin, Roe et al. 2005; Chou and Cai 2006; Pitre, Dehne et al. 2006; Shen, Zhang et al. 2007; 
Guo, Yu et al. 2008; van Dijk, Ter Braak et al. 2008). van Dijk et al. proposed a method that discovers 
overrepresented sequence motifs and then predicts PPIs based on correlated motifs. Shoemaker and 
Panchenko have provided a comprehensive review of these computational methods (Shoemaker and 
Panchenko 2007). These methods can be roughly grouped into five categories: gene neighbor and gene cluster 
methods, phylogenetic profile methods, Rosetta Stone method, sequence-based co-evolution methods, and 
classification-based methods. 
Advantages and disadvantages of different methods 
Gene neighbor and gene cluster methods are based on that genes with similar functions are often transcribed 
as a single unit, an operon, and are co-regulated. Some methods of predicting operons have been proposed 
(Salgado, Moreno-Hagelsieb et al. 2000; Ermolaeva, White et al. 2001; Strong, Mallick et al. 2003; Bowers, 
Pellegrini et al. 2004). An advantage of such methods is the ability to provide additional evidence about 
functional linkage between their constituent genes (Overbeek, Fonstein et al. 1999; Galperin and Koonin 2000; 
Rogozin, Makarova et al. 2002; Bowers, Pellegrini et al. 2004). A disadvantage of such methods is the 
4 
 
complementing our ML-based. This part includes not only implementation and comparison but also algorithm 
enhancement. Finally, the hybridization framework, including results selection, hierarchy construction, and 
weighting strategy, is described. 
Predicting protein-protein interactions in unbalanced data using primary structure of proteins 
The most critical problem in many ML-based approaches is that though they are only evaluated on those input 
dataset comprising equal number of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. However, most proteins do 
not interact with each other in nature, which means the number of non-interacting pairs should be far more 
than interacting ones (Bader and Hogue 2002; Kumar and Snyder 2002). This unbalanced characteristic of 
PPI datasets will lead to a large number of false positives (Martin, Roe et al. 2005). This project presents a 
novel ML-based method using only the primary sequences to predict interacting proteins. The proposed 
feature set is improved from the conjoint triad feature (Shen, Zhang et al. 2007), which describes protein 
sequence by the frequencies of distinct conjoint triads—three continuous amino acids—observed in a 
sequence. We propose a probability-based mechanism for estimating the significance of triad occurrences 
considering the amino acid composition. This improvement is designed to mitigate the dependency of triad 
occurrence frequencies on the amino acid distribution. Another remarkable contribution of this study is to 
provide a systematic analysis of the effect of data sampling when evaluating prediction performance. 
The present method uses only sequence information for training a classifier to distinguish positive instances of 
truly interacting protein pairs and negative instances of non-interacting protein pairs. In this project, each 
protein sequence is transformed into a feature vector, and each protein pair is represented by concatenating the 
feature vectors of the two individual proteins. The relaxed variable kernel density estimator (RVKDE), 
recently proposed by the authors (Oyang, Hwang et al. 2005), is then invoked to predict protein-protein 
interactions based on the feature vectors. 
This project encodes each protein sequence as a feature vector by considering the amino acid triads observed 
in it. An amino acid triad regards three continuous residues as a unit. Each PPI pair is then encoded by 
concatenating the two feature vectors of the two individual proteins. However, considering all 20
3
 amino acid 
triads requires a 16000-dimensional feature vector to encode a protein pair, which is too large for most 
practical classifiers. Thus, the 20 amino acid types are clustered into seven groups based on their dipoles and 
side chain volumes to reduce the dimensions of a feature vector in a previous study (Shen, Zhang et al. 2007). 
The seven amino acid groups are listed in Table 1.

In our current implementation, n is set to 10,000 to make each estimated si vary less than 1% relative to the 
absolute value of si. Accordingly, each protein sequence is represented as a significance feature vector, in 
which each element si is calculated from oi with Eq. (2). For a protein pair, the two vectors of both protein 
sequences are concatenated to form a 686-dimensional feature vector. 
This project adopts the RVKDE algorithm for accommodating to the large amount of negative instances in 
unbalanced datasets. One main distinctive feature of RVKDE is that it features an average time complexity of 
O(nlogn) for carrying out the training process, where n is the number of instances in the training set. A kernel 
density estimator is in fact an approximate probability density function. Let },{ 21 nsss   be a set of 
instances randomly and independently taken from the distribution governed by Xf  in the m-dimensional 
vector space. Then, with the RVKDE algorithm, the value of Xf  at point v is estimated as follows:

When using RVKDE to predict protein-protein interactions, two kernel density estimators are constructed to

cross-validation or by the user. 
This project adopts a collection of protein-protein interactions from the Human Protein References Database 
(HPRD) (Peri, Navarro et al. 2003; Mishra, Suresh et al. 2006), Release 7. This version of HPRD contains 
38,167 PPI and 25,661 protein entries from literature. Interactions in which more than two proteins participate 
are removed, since it is difficult to confirm which individual proteins in such complexes have physical 
interactions (Soong, Wrzeszczynski et al. 2008). Furthermore, interactions that contain a protein sequence 
with selenocysteine (U) are also removed. The remaining set comprises 37,044 interacting protein pairs in 
which 9,441 proteins are involved. Among these pairs, 17,855 PPIs are observed in vivo. The remaining 
interactions detected based on in vitro experiments might be false positives that occur in laboratory 
procedures but do not occur physiologically (Han, Dupuy et al. 2005). Thus, only the in vivo PPI pairs are 
used in preparing the positive set to prevent introducing spurious interactions. The resultant positive set 
comprises 17,855 interacting protein pairs and 6,429 proteins. The construction of a negative set must be

the number of genomes. The presence likelihood represents how probable that a homolog exists in a specific 
genome. The ith position of the phylogenetic profile indicates the presence likelihood of a homolog of the 
given protein in the ith genome. If no homolog is found, the presence likelihood is zero. Proteins with similar 
phylogenetic profiles are then clustered. Proteins within the same cluster are inferred as having a correlated 
pattern of inheritance and functional linkage. There are two points that are suitable to develop more advanced 
algorithms: the calculation of presence likelihood and the similarity function between two phylogenetic 
profiles. 
 
Figure 2. Amount trend of completely sequenced organisms in KEGG. 
Currently implementations of presence likelihood are not beyond the scope of performing sequence 
alignments (Altschul, Madden et al. 1997). Pre-defining thresholds for quantizing the presence likelihood into 
presence levels—usually only two levels of “0” and “1”—or directly adopting a alignment similarity such as 
bit-score are reasonable approaches. On the other hand, nearly all vector similarity functions could be utilized 
as the similarity function between two phylogenetic profiles. A comprehensive study on these vector similarity 
functions could scatter the research theme yet provide limited benefits. Thus this project proposes a novel 
presence likelihood calculation and adopts several prevailing scoring functions of phylogenetic profiles. 
The improvement of presence likelihood calculation is motivated by the most disadvantages of PP-based 
methods, that is, the incompleteness of sequenced genomes. Most PP-based methods requested to use only 
completely sequenced genomes because that sometime low presence likelihood might be resulted from 
non-sequenced homologs. In this regard, if we can estimate how confidential that the observed low presence 
likelihood is resulted from such cases, an adjustment on the final presence likelihood become possible. The 
most contribution of this improvement is that the proposed method could safely utilize the sequenced parts of 
those incompletely sequenced genomes. From another point view, this operation can largely increase the 
number of usable organisms and, by implication, can further guarantee the prediction accuracy in eukaryotic 
organisms.

prediction error on training samples. A training instance, si, is selected as a support vector when the associated 
weight wi exceeds a user-specified threshold, C. In addition, SVR introduces the following two criteria to 
reduce the risk of overfitting when minimizing prediction error: 1) a user-specified parameter,  , defines a 
tube around the regression function in which errors are ignored; and 2) maximizing the flatness of the 
regression function. The problem is to find the support vectors and determine parameters b and wi, which can 
be solved by constrained quadratic optimization (Witten and Frank 2005). The LIBSVM package (version 
2.86) (Chang and Lin 2001) is used for SVR implementation in this project. So far, all variable can be 
determined in a completely sequenced genome and the E[plo] can be calculated via other variable. When 
applying Eq (3) in an incompletely sequenced genome, the E[plo] is replaced with the observed presence 
likelihood and the real presence likelihood in that incompletely sequenced genome, pl, can be obtained. 
The similarity function of phylogenetic profiles are derived from Enault et al.’s work (Enault, Suhre et al. 
2003). These distance functions includes a) Euclidean distance between two profiles interpreted as vectors, b) 
correlation coefficients between two profiles interpreted as matrices, c) the correlation coefficient between 
two profiles, and d) a variant of correlation coefficients without considering the means. This fourth distance 
function between two profiles i and j is defined as follows:

Hybridizing distinct prediction algorithms 
In the final stage of this project, an effective and applicable hybridization of the developed algorithms is 
required. A notable characteristic of this project is a combination of hetero-algorithms since we wish that the 
differences between the selected methods are large. According this project, at least two algorithms belonging 
to different categories must be considered. To simply report a linear combination of the results from different 
sources is not reasonable. A better strategy is to consider the advantages and disadvantages of alternative 
methods and provide asymmetric hybridization. The original motivation of this project is to cure the low 
precision problem of ML-based methods. Though some improvement algorithms have been proposed, it is 
expected that other methods can deliver higher precision since some auxiliary data is considered. Conversely, 
the ML-based method will still achieve the highest sensitivity since the completeness of any auxiliary data is 
worse than only the protein sequences. Based on these fundamental observations, this project proposes a 
two-stage framework (Figure 4). A PP-based approach is employed, where only protein pairs with high 
phylogenetic similarity are submitted to the second stage, to reduce the data at the first-stage. A unique feature 
of the first stage of this study to other PP-based approaches is a non-zero filter (marked by an asterisk in 
Figure 4), which verifies if the phylogenetic similarity is reliable. Next, a ML-based approach is applied on 
the reduced data for the final prediction. 
The non-zero filter (marked by an asterisk in Figure 4) is designed for rare genes that have homologues in 
only a few reference organisms. Accordingly, the PP of a rare gene contains only a few non-zero values. The 
similarity between two rare genes highly depends on these non-zero values. This condition is similar to using 
a small reference collection, thereby reduces the reliability of the calculated similarity. An extreme example is 
that if two genes present in only a reference organism, a high similarity of their PPs may result from the 
similar phylogenetic characteristic or the rareness. Thus, this study introduced a threshold, denoted as nz, to 
solve this problem. If either PP vector of two genes i and j has non-zero values less than nz, their PP similarity 
12 
 
In addition to an evaluation organism, the first stage of the proposed framework requires a reference 
collection to construct PPs. This study used the 829 prokaryotes and 132 eukaryotes in the KEGG database to 
compile a prokaryotic and a eukaryotic reference collection, respectively. S. cerevisiae was not included in the 
eukaryotic reference collection. In addition, a third reference collection consisting of only the 220 prokaryotic 
organisms released before 2006 was compiled for a fair comparison with other approaches of PPI prediction. 
The newest strain was used if multiple strains were available for an organism. In these reference organisms, 
only the gene and protein sequences were required. Since the PPI information of the reference organisms was 
not used, these organisms were not training data in machine learning. 
Finally, the second stage of the proposed framework needs a training organism of which the PPI information 
is required. This study retrieved 4,493 proteins and 106 pathways of Escherichia coli from the KEGG 
database. After applying the same filters as the query organism, the training organism of this study consisted 
of 1,355 E. coli proteins, which form 217,155 positive and 700,180 negative pairs. 
Contribution of each stage 
This subsection reports the performance of the proposed two-stage approach as well as the performance of the 
first and the second stage individually. Conventional PP-based methods need to determine a similarity 
threshold, where protein pairs with similarity higher than the threshold are predicted as PPIs. In this study, the 
PP-based first stage was a filter to reduce the input data of the second stage. The threshold was selected to 
preserve the most reliable data while making the second stage computationally applicable. In this experiment, 
an extremely loose threshold was used—only protein pairs with zero similarity were filtered—since the 
resulting data of 2,163 protein pairs can be processed by the RVKDE in a minute. The non-zero filter was also 
set to an extremely loose threshold nz = 1, namely only PPs with all zeros were filtered. As will be illustrated 
in subsection 3.4, the non-zero filter, though it was very loose, did help the prediction performance. 
The preparation of using either stage as an individual PPI predictor was similar to the procedure of the 
two-stage framework except that (i) the individual first stage used the PP similarity, instead of the likelihood 
reported by the RVKDE, to rank protein pairs and (ii) the input data of the individual second stage was 
selected randomly while preserving the quantities of positive and negative samples equal to those selected by 
the first stage. The two-stage, the individual first stage and the individual second stage are respectively 
denoted as Predboth, Pred1st and Pred2nd in the context. Since the preparation of Pred2nd involved randomness, 
the prediction process of Pred2nd was repeated ten times to alleviate the bias. 
Figure 5 depicts the precision, as measured by positive predictive value (PPV), of the 2000 highest ranked 
predictions made by the Predboth, Pred1st and Pred2nd. The Predboth achieved the best performance, especially 
in the high-precision area. Compared to the Pred1st, the Predboth had an advantage of precision by >10% at the 
top 200 predictions and this advantage remained >5% until the top 1,200 predictions. The diminishing 
advantage is reasonable since the Predboth used the Pred1st as a filter to obtain a smaller data of the 2,163 
samples of the query organism. Their performances were getting close as the number of predictions 
approaching 2,163. Compared to the Pred2nd, the Predboth outperformed by 15.8–0.4% from top 50 to 2000 
predictions. The Pred1st was better than the Pred2nd in this experiment. A possible explanation is that the 
Pred1st utilized 220 reference organisms while the Pred2nd utilized only E. coli. Another observation is that the 
Pred2nd was more stable than the Pred1st. In summary, the proposed two-stage yielded better performance than 
either stage and was as stable as the Pred2nd. It means that this study has combined two different types of 
approaches successfully. 
Comparison with existing methods 
This subsection compares the proposed two-stage framework to three PP-based and two ML-based 
14 
 
will be elaborated in the next subsection. In summary, the first stage of the proposed method was better than 
all the compared methods. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved the best performance without 
depending on the number of predictions. It stably yielded >10% precision advantage over the compared 
methods in the range of top 300–1100 predictions. 
Effect of the non-zero filter 
The Pred1st was improved from the Enault et al. method by introducing the non-zero filter. Surprisingly, the 
Pred1st delivered the best performance while the Enault et al. method delivered the worst performance in the 
high-precision area. By manually examining the generated PPs, we concluded that some PP pairs had high 
similarity in the Enault et al. method only because of having too many zeros. Thus, their similarities depended 
only on a few reference organisms and were less reliable. This observation explains the good performance of 
the Pred1st, whose non-zero filter was designed to solve this problem. However, to choose a proper threshold 
of nz raises a new problem. This subsection further elaborates whether different nz thresholds largely affect 
the prediction performance. Figure 6 shows the performance of the Pred1st using different nz thresholds. Using 
a larger nz made fewer predictions (from 2,163 to 939 predictions in Figure 6) as less protein pairs passed the 
non-zero filter. In theory, using a larger nz requires PPs having more non-zero elements for similarity 
calculation and achieves a higher precision. This tendency can be observed from nz = 0 to nz = 3. However, 
increasing the nz threshold to four and five decreased the prediction performance. The result that the best nz 
threshold is small indicates that the PPs of many proteins in the query organism did contain many zero 
elements. This could be resulted from that (i) the reference collection was small or (ii) the reference collection 
was dissimilar to the query organism. To further elucidate this phenomenon, the prediction performances of 
using different nz thresholds were also analyzed on two other reference collections. 
 
Figure 6 Performance of using different non-zero (nz) thresholds. The y-axis is the ratio of correct 
predictions predicted in the top n predictions (x-axis). 
First, the larger prokaryotic reference collection of 829 prokaryotes was used. Figure 7(a) shows the best nz 
threshold using this reference collection. The best nz threshold was larger than that using the reference 
collection of 220 prokaryotes, especially in the high-precision (namely, few-prediction) region. This echoes 
16 
 
using the eukaryotic reference collection in applications that require many predictions. 
 
Figure 8 Performance using different reference collections. The y-axis is the ratio of correct predictions 
predicted in the top n predictions (x-axis). 
The previous studies concluded that PP-based approaches are not capable for eukaryotes (Enault, Suhre et al. 
2003; Snitkin, Gustafson et al. 2006). Furthermore, they found that using eukaryotes as the reference 
collection led to worse performance than using prokaryotes due to the insufficiency of completely sequenced 
eukaryotes. However, through introducing the proposed non-zero filter, this study slightly refined the 
conclusion of previous studies to that PP-based methods are promising for eukaryotes based on currently 
available eukaryotic genomes with an appropriate mechanism to verify the reliability of PPs. 
Conclusions 
This project proposed a two-stage predictor of protein-protein interaction, which successfully combines 
phylogenetic profile-based and machine learning-based methods as well as introduced a non-zero filter to 
enhance the reliability of phylogenetic similarity. The experimental results show that the proposed two-stage 
framework achieved good performance and preserved the advantages of both categories of methods: (i) high 
performance in the top predictions of phylogenetic profile-based methods and (ii) stable performance of 
machine learning-based methods. In addition, the proposed non-zero filter has been shown that phylogenetic 
profile-based methods are promising for eukaryotes based on currently available eukaryotic genomes. The 
discovery of this study helps analyzing protein-protein interaction and encourages developing hybrid 
framework in the future.

一、參加會議經過 
這次出訪參加 2010 年國際研討會 9th International Conference on Bioinformatics, InCoB 2010)，主要目的
為發表論文並跟與會的研究者交流，學習及接收其他各國家相關領域研究人員的研究成果。我們的研
究成果主要利用機器學習演算法來分析生物分子間的關係，並應用在蛋白質與 DNA 以及蛋白質與蛋白
質的分析上。我們預期目標為更進一步將此這些結果整理成期刊論文。 
InCoB 已經是亞洲生物資訊領域中一個非常重要的會議，每年能與這些研究人員交換過去一年來的研
究成果以及心得，對我們在領域現況的掌握度，以及推廣我們甚至台灣的研究成果上，都是一個很好
的機會。透過每個與會研究人員的介紹，我們能得知一些平常不太參與的研究題目的研究背景、過程
及結果。也進一步了解各國資訊研究人員所投入研究的趨勢及進展。另外，在研討會的氛圍中，討論
風氣很盛行，藉由討論可以減低不少錯誤的機會，因此可以省下不少的時間。另外每個參與的研究人
員都很熱心的回答問題，可以學到不少東西。

計畫執行期間發表 2個國際型生物資料庫。一個被 Nucleic Acids Research (Impact 
Factor 超過 8)選為 Featured Article (represent the top 5% of papers in terms of 
originality, significance and scientific excellence)，說明其重要性。另一個發表僅
半年，已有來自五大洲、28 種語言、41 個國家、135 座城市共 325 位學者，造訪了 1,048 次
並執行過 6,035 個指令，這些數字顯示其在國際上受到關注的程度。 
3. 請依學術成就、技術創新、社會影響等方面，評估研究成果之學術或應用價
值（簡要敘述成果所代表之意義、價值、影響或進一步發展之可能性）（以
500字為限） 
自 2010 計畫開始執行至今，本計畫的研究團隊發表了 13 篇國際期刊論文，以及 8篇的國
際會議與研討會論文，並完成 1篇專書章節。所發表的國際期刊論文皆為 SCI，其中更有
七篇是發表在領域排名前 15%的期刊上，包含 1篇領域排名前 5%以及 2篇 Impact Factor
超過 8的優秀期刊。以上的學術成就說明本團隊的研究成果受到高度重視。 
計畫執行期間主要的學術成果是一套先進的蛋白質互動預測模型，以及基於該演算法所完
成的分析平台。2001年人類基因序列定序計畫 (Human genome project) 的結果指出，人
類基因體大小約 30 億鹼基對，包含約 21000 個基因，但 42%的功能尚不清楚，因此在基
因序列解碼後的今天仍舊有許多的未知等待解答。由於在人類疾病中，由單一種基因異常
所引起的疾病非常少數，而其他多數疾病則由數個基因同時表現異常所造成。因此欲清楚
得知疾病的機轉，必須了解基因最終產物的蛋白質及其之間交互作用所形成的網絡。而這
正是本計畫欲解決的主要問題。 
本計畫在技術上的突破可以分為兩個方面。第一方面是效能的提升。本計畫探討造成過去
分析技術效能瓶頸的主要原因，發展出一套以樣本式學習(instance based learning)演
算法為基礎的分析技術，該方法在犧牲少量準確度(約 1%)的情況下，將原本需要數年的分
