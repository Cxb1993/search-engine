1. INTRODUCTION 
 Colorectal cancer is the third common cancer in Taiwan and drives from 
colonic mucosal neoplastic lesions. Colonic mucosal neoplastic lesions are 
classified into two groups: polypoid and non-polypoid. Polypoid lesions are easy 
to detect and not invasive until they are rather large. But non-polypoid lesions 
can invade the muscularis mucosa and the submucosa even though they are quite 
small. Muto et al. reported that the non-polypoid lesions were the candidate 
precursors of colorectal cancer. In order to reduce colorectal cancer risk, detect 
the non-polypoid lesions early and removal of adenomaous polyps is an 
effective method. [ Department of Health, Executive Yuan, R.O.C; Taylor J.C. et 
al., 2006; Kudo S.E. et al.,2000; Su M.Y. et al., 2005; Kudo S.E. et al.,1997; 
Muto T. et al. 1985 ] 
Colonoscopy is simple and common method to view colonic imaging, but it 
is easy to miss the small and flat adenomas. However, these indistinguishable 
regions can be using a variety of color contrast or absorptive agent to enhance 
the detail, such as indigo carmine and methylene blue. Sprayed the dye onto the 
mucosal surface directly, they could be accumulated in the pits and crevices of 
the mucosa. Kudo et al. verified that used magnified endoscopy and indigo 
carmine dye could characterize aberrant crypt foci according to the pit pattern 
analysis. [ Kudo S.E. et al. 1994 ] 
Indigo carmine dye is commonly used for chromoendoscopy because it is 
cheap, not absorbed, non-toxicity, and easy to perform. In an aqueous solution of 
0.1%~1.0%, indigo carmine dye could be sprayed directly onto the surface of 
mucosa and generate a color contrast to the light red bowel wall. Especially the 
navy blue color fill the bottom of flat ulcers, erosions, folds and pits, and 
emphasize the flat type of early colorectal cancer particularly. Likewise, indigo 
carmine dye has been performed to emphasize epithelium in the oesophagus. 
But indigo carmine just only stains the surface of mucosa to emphasize the 
contrast of the gradation. It does not have the ability for targeting specific space. 
For this reason, we want to develop a carrier loaded with indigo carmine to 
accumulating in adenomaous polyps specifically and still possess the staining 
contrast. [ Brooker J.C. et al. 2002; Jung M. et al. 1999 ] 
Chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer of repeating units of D-glucosamine 
and N-acetylglucosamine. It is a biocompatible, non-toxicity, biodegradable and 
antibacterial polymer, and it is soluble in an aqueous acidic solution below pH 
6.5. Chitosan is a suitable material for constructing nanoparticles because of its 
reactive amino groups, which make it more possible to chemically modify and 
conjugate with various ligands or antibodies. Its cationic amino group can form 
complexes with negatively charge drug/DNA through a strong electrostatic 
interaction. [ Mi F.L. et al 2007; Kumar MNVR, 2000; Park J.H et al 2005 ] 
(f06). 
 
2-3. Preparation of chitosan nanoparticles 
Chitosan conjugation with various content folic acid was dissolved into 
0.01N and 0.02N acetic acid solution to the concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and pH 
4.0. Indigo carmine powder was dissolved into 0.5 mg/ml STPP solution to 
different concentrations (0.25 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml and 0.75 mg/ml) and pH 7.4. 
Two ml of STPP solution and/or 2 ml of indigo carmine solution were added in 
5 ml of chitosan solution or chitosan conjugated with folic acid solution by 
peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min to prepare CN, fCN, CNIC and 
fCNIC. The prepared CN, fCN, CNIC and fCNIC suspended in the solution 
would be directly used in later experiment without further treatment. 
 
2-4. Average particle size and zeta potential 
 The average particle size and the zeta potential of chitosan nanoparticles 
were determined by Zetasizer (Malvern Zetasizer 3000 HS). All measurements 
were performed at 25oC at scattering angle of 90o. 
 
2-5. Transmission electron microscope 
Carbon coated 200 mesh copper grids were immersed in CN, fCN, CNIC 
and fCNIC solution by tweezers and wavered slowly. The grids were placed on 
delicate-task-wipers to absorb excessive liquid and dried in a desiccator 
overnight. The dried copper grids with nanoparticles were examined under 
Hitachi TEM H-7500. 
 
2-6. Loading efficiency of indigo carmine in nanoparticles 
 100µL NaOH (0.1N) was added into 1ml chitosan nanoparticles 
solution and vortexed for 1 minute. Then the mixed solution was centrifugedd at 
14000rpm for 20 minute and read the OD value at 606nm by the UV/Vis 
spectrophotometer (Cary 50 Conc. Varian, USA). The loading efficiency of 
indigo carmine in nanoparticles was calculated by following equation： 
Loading efficiency (%) = 
tC
fCtC −
×100 % 
where Ct and Cf were total amount of indigo carmine and free amount of indigo 
carmine, respectively. 
 
2-7. Cell culture 
 Human colon carcinoma cells (HT-29) were cultured in T75 flask using 
 The loading efficiency of indigo carmine in chitosan nanoparticle was 
below 10 % and decreased whit the increasing the concentration of indigo 
carmine when the concentration of acetic acid was 0.01N (figure 4). However, 
when the acetic acid concentration was 0.02N, the loading efficiency of indigo 
carmine could be high to the range of 60 t0 70 % (figure 5). But the 
concentration of acetic acid was kept on increasing; loading efficiency of indigo 
carmine would decrease gradually. Because the chitosan molecules were more 
stable in acidic solution and carried much positive electricity, the high 
concentration of acetic acid would let the change of environment pH be small, 
and the protonated chitosan molecules could encapsulate much indigo carmine. 
 As the results showed in figure 5, the loading efficiency decreased with the 
increasing of conjugated ratio of folic acid on chitosan. Because conjugated with 
folic acid would consume some amino groups of chitosan, there were less 
protonated amino groups could interact with indigo carmine drug and resulted in 
low loading efficiency. 
 
3-4. Adhesion of nanoparticles on cells 
The adhesion of nanoparticles on cells was investigated by HT-29 cells 
which were incubated in the DMEM medium with CNIG, f02CNIG, f04CNIG, 
and f06CNIG at 37 oC for 1 hour and 3 hours. As the results showed in figure 6, 
there was no significant difference in OD value of indigo carmine between the 
chitosan nanoparticles conjugated with different ratio of folic acid after 1 hour. 
But it showed that the content of f06CNIG adhered on HT-29 cells was higher 
than other chitosan nanoparticles after 3 hours (figure 7). It exhibited that CNIG 
conjugated with more folic acid (f06CNIG) had a higher affinity to the folate 
receptors on HT-29 cell surface. 
Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the optical pictures of HT-29 cells incubated 
with f06CNIG or indigo carmine drug for different incubation time. As these 
results showed, the HT-29 cells incubated with f06CNIG become more and 
more blue when the incubation time increased. But the HT-29 cells incubated 
with indigo carmine revealed no significant difference for different incubation 
time. It was showed that indigo carmine could not adhere on the cell membrane 
for long time or be uptaken by cells. But the chitosan nanoparticle which was 
conjugated with folic acid could adhere on the cell membrane or might be 
uptaken by HT-29 cells via the folate receptor-mediated endocytosis.
