?????? CAPABILITY MEASURES FOR PROCESSES WITH ONE-SIDED SPECIFICATION LIMIT AND TARGET VALUE 
 
???????? 
    The conference served as important meeting for the exchange of ideas and information to 
promote understanding among the various practitioners, scientists, and engineers that are working 
on the fundamental aspects of industrial engineering, and the associated applications of the resulting 
technical and methodological applications, case studies, and surveys. In the conference, I presented 
a paper entitled “CAPABILITY MEASURES FOR PROCESSES WITH ONE-SIDED 
SPECIFICATION LIMIT AND TARGET VALUE,” and the topic attracted the attention of 
attendants because the issue has not been researched a lot in the past. 
 
?????? 
The conference was a forum for researchers and practitioners from many countries to share their 
research findings and practical experiences on variety of the areas in industrial engineering.  The 
selected articles cover theory, applications and practice of a variety of the areas in industrial 
engineering.  Today, as the economics environment surrounding industrial systems becomes to be 
global and complex, traditional approach to industrial engineering no longer suffices.  The new 
theory and its applications in practice need to be explored, developed, and implemented.  The 
conference offered the memorable opportunity to all the participants to achieve those goals. 
The financial support by NSC is too limited to attend conferences overseas.  In order to share 
research findings and practical experiences with scholars in other parts of the world and to enhance 
our research ability, I sincerely suggest NSC to increase the funding for researchers who are willing 
to present in international conferences.

constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis testing. 
In order to develop successfully a decision-making rule based on the estimated index TUCˆ (or TLCˆ ) to test whether a 
normally distributed process is capable or not, the cumulative distribution function of TUCˆ (or TLCˆ ) is needed. In this paper, 
we obtain an explicit form of the cumulated distribution functions of the maximal likelihood estimators (MLEs) of CTU and 
CTL, which can be expressed in terms of a mixture of the chi-square distribution and the normal distribution. We then 
implement the theory of testing hypothesis using the MLEs of CTU and CTL, and provide an efficient Maple program to 
calculate the p-values. Based on the test, we develop a simple step-by-step procedure. The practitioners can use the 
proposed procedure to determine whether their process meets the preset capability requirement, and make reliable 
decisions. 
 
 
2. DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE ESTIMATED CTU AND CTL 
 
In general the process mean μ and the process variance σ2 are unknown. Therefore both the indices CTU and CTL are also 
unknown. In practice μ and σ2 must be estimated using the sample data. The  natural  estimators  of CTU and CTL are 
respectively defined as:

LSLˆ

S X
−=
+ −
,            (3) 
 
where  X   =  1 /n ii X n=∑   and  2nS   =  21( ) /n ii X X n= −∑   are  the maximum  likelihood  estimators  (MLEs)  of  μ  and σ2 
respectively, which may be obtained from a process that is demonstrably stable (under statistical control). Since a MLE 
is invariant, then  TUCˆ  and TLCˆ are the MLEs of CTU and CTL, respectively. 
  We will consider the case with an upper specification limit USL only. The case with a lower specification limit 
LSL is analogous. To derive the probability density functions and the distribution functions of TUCˆ  and TLCˆ , we define  
(1) bU = (USL – T)/σ, bL = (LSL – T)/σ, and ξ = (μ − T)/σ, 
(2) K = n 2nS /σ2, which is distributed as  2 n  1χ − , 
(3) Z = n1/2( X  − T)/σ, which is distributed as N(δ, 1) with δ = n1/2ξ. 
Let FK( · ) and fK( · ) denote the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of K, 
respectively. Let Φ( · ) and φ( · ) denote the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of the 
standardized normal distribution N(0, 1), respectively. Then, the cumulative distribution function of Z can be expressed as 
FZ(z) = Φ(z − δ) and the probability density function of Z can be expressed as fZ(z) = φ(z − δ). And, the estimators TUCˆ  and 
TLCˆ  can be rewritten respectively as:

The derivations of the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of TUCˆ  are given in the 
Appendix. Figures 1(a) - (d) display the plots of the probability density function of TUCˆ  for n = 20, 30, and 50 (from 
bottom to top in plots), with (a) (USL - T) = 4σ, μ = T + 1σ, (b) (USL - T) = 4σ, μ = T - 1σ, (c) (USL - T) = 6σ, μ = T + 
1.5σ, and (d) (USL - T) = 6σ, μ = T - 1.5σ, respectively. From Figure 1, we observe that the spread decreases as sample 
size n increases. Figures 2(a) - (d) display the plots of the probability density function of TUCˆ  for n = 30, with (a) (USL - T) 
= 4σ, and μ = T, T + 0.5σ, T + 1σ, T + 1.5σ, (b) (USL - T) = 4σ, and μ = T, T - 0.5σ, T - 1σ, T - 1.5σ, (c) (USL - T) = 6σ, 
and μ = T, T + 0.5σ, T + 1σ, T + 1.5σ, and (d) (USL - T) = 6σ, μ = T - 1.5σ, μ = T, T - 0.5σ, T - 1σ, T - 1.5σ (from right to 
left in plots). From Figure 2, we observe that the spread decreases as the value of |μ - T| increases. 
 
 
3. TESTING PROCESS PERFORMANCE 
 
To test whether a given process is capable, we may consider the following statistical testing hypotheses: 
 H0: CTU ≤ C (process is not capable), 
H1: CTU > C (process is capable). 
Based on a given α(cα) = α, the chance of incorrectly concluding an incapable process (CTU≤ C) as capable (CTU > C), the 
decision rule is to reject H0 (CTU ≤ C) if TUCˆ > cα and fails to reject H0 otherwise. 
Since CTU can be rewritten as CTU = (bU – ξ)/[3(1 + ξ2)1/2], then bU = (USL – T)/σ can be expressed as bU = ξ + 3C(1 
+ ξ2)1/2 given CTU = C. Because a poor process will get a small value of capability index, we only consider the process with 
CTU > 1/3. Given a value of C (the capability requirement) which is larger than 1/3, the p-value corresponding to c*, a 
specific value of TUCˆ  calculated from the sample data, is (by Eq. (5)): 
 
P( TUCˆ ≥ c*| CTU = C) = ( )U

− − − ⋅φ − δ∫            (7) 
 
 
for c* > 1/3. Note that we will conclude a process is incapable if the corresponding value of c* is less than 1/3. 
Given values of α and C, the critical value cα can be obtained by solving the equation P( TUCˆ ≥ cα| CTU = C) = α. 
Hence, given values of capability requirement C, parameter ξ, sample size n, and risk α, the critical value cα can be 
obtained by solving the following equation:

α− − − ⋅φ − δ∫  = α                   (8) 
 
 
An efficient Maple program is developed for calculating Eq. (7) to obtain the p-value for given c*. We note that 
similar programs can also be written using software “Mathematica” or “MatLab”.  
The program is listed below, with input parameters set to USL = 3.6, T = 3.0, C = 1.50, n = 50, X  = 3.025, Sn = 
0.095 as an example. Here, we set ξ = ξˆ  = ( X  − T)/Sn, since generally ξ = (μ − Τ)/σ is unknown. Therefore, given 
value of C we set bU as ξˆ  + 3C(1 + 2ξˆ )0.5. This approach is similar to one proposed by Cheng (1994). On the other hand, 
c* = TUCˆ  can be calculated from the sample data. The program gives ξˆ  = 0.2632, TUCˆ = 1.9511, and the corresponding 
p-value as 0.0163.

Since K is distributed as  ,2 1n −χ  then P{K < [( Ub n – z)/(3x)]2 – z2} = 0 for g(z) < 0 and x > 0, where g(z) = [( Ub n –  
z)/(3x)]2 – z2 for 
Ub .z n−∞ < <   
The solutions of the equation g(z) = 0 are z = z1 = Ub n /(1 – 3x) and z = z2 = Ub n /(1 + 3x). In case of 0 < x ≤  
1/3, note that z2 < Ub n  < z1, g(z) < 0 for z2 < z < z1, and g(z) > 0 for z < z2 or z > z1. For case of x > 1/3, we have z1 < z2 
< Ub n , g(z) < 0 for z < z1 or z > z2, and g(z) > 0 for z1 < z < z2. Hence,
