single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and 
concluded that the modulus is insensitive to 
the tube’s structural parameters, e.g. its radius 
and helicity. Several researchers have 
employed molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations with the Tersoff-Brenner potential 
[10-12] to evaluate the elastic moduli of 
nanotubes. Yakobson et al. [10] simulated the 
structural instability of SWNTs under axial 
compression and obtained Young’s moduli 
ranging from 1.4 to 5.5 TPa. Robertson et al. 
[11] reported that the Young’s modulus for a 
nanotube is smaller than that of a graphene 
sheet. Cornwell and Wille [12] developed a 
simple mathematical formula to approximate 
the Young’s modulus of nanotubes with a 
wide range of tube radii. 
Quantum mechanical-based methods 
such as the ab initio and tight-binding (TB) 
schemes have also been employed to predict 
the Young’s moduli of nanotubes [13-16]. 
Using a non-orthogonal TB scheme, 
Hernández et al. [13] obtained an average 
value of 1.24 TPa for the Young’s modulus of 
an SWNT with a diameter equivalent to that 
observed experimentally (~1.2 nm). 
Sánchez-Portal et al. [14] performed ab initio 
calculations based on pseudo-potential density 
function theory and established that the 
Young’s moduli of SWNTs range from 0.95 to 
1.10 TPa. van Lier et al. [15] conducted an ab 
initio study of the elastic properties of SWNTs 
and graphene and predicted a Young’s 
modulus value of more than 1 TPa. The 
numerical results indicated that the Young’s 
modulus of graphene was smaller than that of 
a (5, 5) nanotube. Similar findings were also 
reported by Peralta-Inga et al. [16], who used 
a density functional tight-binding (DFTB) 
approach to study the elastic properties of a 
series of SWNTs with diameters ranging from 
0.55 to 1.08 nm. The results showed that the 
Young’s modulus decreased with increasing 
tube radius and approached the modulus of a 
graphene sheet in the limiting case.  
Using anisotropic continuum theory and 
the finite element numerical method, Wang et 
al. [20-22] investigated the Young’s modulus, 
bending modulus, and transverse sound wave 
speed in carbon nanotubes. The results 
indicated that the effective Young’s modulus 
decreases significantly as the nanotube 
diameter increases. This finding is consistent 
with the experimental results reported by 
Poncharal et al. [3]. Using transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM) to analyze the 
intrinsic thermal vibrations of an anchored 
tube, Treacy et al. [1] obtained an average 
value of 1.8 TPa for the Young’s modulus of 
multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). 
Krishnan et al. [17] also used TEM to observe 
the vibration of SWNTs with diameters 
ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 nm at room 
temperature and concluded that the Young’s 
modulus ranged from 0.95 to 1.70 Tpa, with 
an average value of 1.25 TPa. Using an atomic 
force microscope (AFM), Wong et al. [18] 
investigated nanotubes of larger diameters and 
showed that the Young’s modulus of MWNTs 
with diameters ranging from 26 to 76 nm was 
1.28± 0.59 TPa. Tombler et al. [19] used an 
AFM to bend an SWNT and reported a 
Young’s modulus of approximately 1.2 TPa. 
From the discussions above, it is clear that the 
experimental values of the Young’s moduli for 
nanotubes are consistently higher than the 
in-plane modulus of graphene (~1.20 TPa [13, 
15]). 
The literature generally indicates that the 
Young’s modulus of CNTs is insensitive to the 
tube’s helicity. Therefore, the scope of the 
present investigation is restricted to zigzag 
SWNTs. Although many previous studies have 
reported that the Young’s modulus of an NT 
varies with the tube radius, particularly when 
the tube radius is small [13, 15], few 
researchers have investigated the temperature 
dependence of the Young’s modulus. Treacy et 
al. [1] reported a linear relationship between 
the square of the vibrational amplitude of the 
tube’s free tip displacement and the tube 
temperature, implying that the tube’s elastic 
modulus is temperature-independent. 
However, the highest temperature considered 
in their study was only 1000 K, and, as will be 
shown in this study, the elastic modulus of 
SWNTs becomes temperature-dependent 
when the temperature of the nanotube is 
increased beyond this value. 
 
2. Methodology 
This study employs MD simulations to 
investigate the same intrinsic thermal behavior 
of SWNTs as that observed by Krishnan et al. 
using TEM [17]. In the present simulations, 
the SWNT is modeled as a clamped cantilever 
beam and the vibrational amplitude of the 
tube’s free tip displacement, u, is obtained as a 
- 2 - 
tube radius at a temperature below 1100K. It 
is found that the Young’s modulus decreases 
with increasing radius in accordance with the 
relation Y∝R-0.896 for small R. However, as R 
increases beyond the range of experimentally 
observed tube radii (i.e. approximately 0.6 
nm), the Young’s modulus approaches a 
constant value, which, according to 
Peralta-Inga et al. [16], is equivalent to the 
in-plane modulus of graphene. Fig. 2 also 
presents the results of previous studies [13, 
15-17] for comparison purposes. Significantly, 
Peralta-Inga et al. considered only SWNTs of 
small radii due to the computational 
complexity of the DFTB method employed in 
their study. However, the current MD 
simulations are computationally more 
straightforward and hence SWNTs of larger 
radii can be analyzed. It can be seen that the 
present results for a large tube radius are 
consistent with the findings of Peralta-Inga et 
al. [16], i.e. as the tube radius increases, the 
value of the Young’s modulus approaches the 
in-plane modulus of a graphene sheet 
(approximately 1.2 TPa) [13, 15]. This 
Young’s modulus value is very close to the 
average value of 1.25 TPa obtained 
experimentally by Krishnan et al. [17]. Since 
Peralta-Inga et al. [16] took no account of the 
tube thickness, δ, when evaluating the Young’s 
modulus of SWNTs, the agreement between 
the present simulation results and those of 
Peralta-Inga et al. implies that the current 
choice of δ= 0.34 nm for the tube thickness is 
appropriate when evaluating the Young’s 
modulus of SWNTs.  
Eq. (1) also allows the temperature 
dependence of the Young’s modulus of the 
SWNT to be determined. The present 
simulation results reveal that when the tube 
temperature is less than approximately 1100K, 
σ2 increases with an averagely constant slope 
as the tube temperature increases. This 
indicates that the Young’s modulus is 
insensitive to the tube temperature. However, 
at temperatures higher than 1100K, the slope 
of the σ2-T curve varies more noticeably. It 
can therefore be concluded that when the tube 
temperature is relatively high, the Young’s 
modulus is temperature dependent. Fig. 3 
shows the variation of the Young’s modulus as 
a function of the tube temperature for SWNTs 
of different radii. The temperature variation 
curves all indicate that the Young’s modulus 
has a constant value when the tube 
temperature is lower than approximately 
1100K, but decreases rapidly with increasing 
tube temperature at higher temperatures. 
Furthermore, as the tube radius increases, the 
temperature variation curves tend to converge, 
as predicted by Fig.2. In other words, 
irrespective of the SWNT temperature, the 
variation of the Young’s modulus with the 
tube radius is consistent with that shown in 
Fig.2. The temperature at which a significant 
reduction in the Young’s modulus occurs 
represents a transition point at which the 
nanotube begins to become elastically weaker. 
It is noted that the transition temperatures 
shown in Fig.3 for the various SWNTs are 
approximately equal. Therefore, it can be 
inferred that the transition temperature is 
insensitive to the tube radius. Finally, it is 
observed that even at an extremely high 
temperature, e.g. 2000K, the “small” Young’s 
modulus value of approximately 0.9 TPa 
obtained for the largest radius tube is still 
significantly higher than that of other known 
materials. Fig. 3 also presents the temperature 
dependence of the armchair (5, 5) SWNT, 
whose radius is approximately equal to that of 
the zigzag (9, 0) SWNT. As shown, the 
temperature dependence of the Young’s 
modulus of the armchair nanotube is very 
similar to that of the zigzag (9, 0) SWNT. 
Therefore, it can be concluded that the elastic 
modulus of an SWNT is insensitive to its 
helicity.  
Fig. 3 provides no more than a broad 
estimate of the transition temperature. To 
determine the threshold temperature more 
precisely, this study examined the correlation 
function of the bond angles, θ, among the 
sp2-bonded carbon atoms of the SWNT. To 
calculate the angular correlation function 
(ACF) of an SWNT, it is necessary to measure 
three bond angles of each carbon atom other 
than those located at the ends of the tube. 
Hence, if N atoms are considered, then the 
correlation function calculation involves a 
total of 3N bond angles. For an SWNT, 
although the individual bond angle, θ, varies 
over time, the ACF of the SWNT remains 
approximately constant during the thermal 
vibration period. Averaging the individual 
bond angles over the N atoms involved in the 
ACF evaluation and calculating the 
corresponding standard deviation, σθ, it is

Theoretical variations in the Young’s modulus of SWNTs with tube radius and temperature
predict the Young’s moduli of nanotubes [13–16]. Using a
non-orthogonal TB scheme, Herna´ndez et al [13] obtained
an average value of 1.24 TPa for the Young’s modulus
of an SWNT with a diameter equivalent to that observed
experimentally (∼1.2 nm). Sa´nchez-Portal et al [14]
performed ab initio calculations based on pseudo-potential
density function theory and established that the Young’s
moduli of SWNTs range from 0.95 to 1.10 TPa. van Lier et al
[15] conducted an ab initio study of the elastic properties of
SWNTs and graphene and predicted a Young’s modulus value
of more than 1 TPa. The numerical results indicated that the
Young’s modulus of graphene was smaller than that of a (5, 5)
nanotube. Similar findings were also reported by Peralta-Inga
et al [16], who used a density functional tight-binding (DFTB)
approach to study the elastic properties of a series of SWNTs
with diameters ranging from 0.55 to 1.08 nm. The results
showed that the Young’s modulus decreased with increasing
tube radius and approached the modulus of a graphene sheet in
the limiting case.
Using anisotropic continuum theory and the finite element
numerical method, Wang et al [20–22] investigated the
Young’s modulus, bending modulus, and transverse sound
wave speed in carbon nanotubes. The results indicated
that the effective Young’s modulus decreases significantly as
the nanotube diameter increases. This finding is consistent
with the experimental results reported by Poncharal et al
[3]. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to
analyse the intrinsic thermal vibrations of an anchored tube,
Treacy et al [1] obtained an average value of 1.8 TPa
for the Young’s modulus of multi-walled carbon nanotubes
(MWNTs). Krishnan et al [17] also used TEM to observe
the vibration of SWNTs with diameters ranging from 1.0 to
1.5 nm at room temperature and concluded that the Young’s
modulus ranged from 0.95 to 1.70 TPa, with an average value
of 1.25 TPa. Using an atomic force microscope (AFM),
Wong et al [18] investigated nanotubes of larger diameters and
showed that the Young’s modulus of MWNTs with diameters
ranging from 26 to 76 nm was 1.28 ± 0.59 TPa. Tombler et al
[19] used an AFM to bend an SWNT and reported a Young’s
modulus of approximately 1.2 TPa. From the discussions
above, it is clear that the experimental values of the Young’s
moduli for nanotubes are consistently higher than the in-plane
modulus of graphene (∼1.20 TPa [13, 15]).
The literature generally indicates that the Young’s
modulus of CNTs is insensitive to the tube’s helicity.
Therefore, the scope of the present investigation is restricted
to zigzag SWNTs. Although many previous studies have
reported that the Young’s modulus of an NT varies with the
tube radius, particularly when the tube radius is small [13, 15],
few researchers have investigated the temperature dependence
of the Young’s modulus. Treacy et al [1] reported a linear
relationship between the square of the vibrational amplitude
of the tube’s free tip displacement and the tube temperature,
implying that the tube’s elastic modulus is temperature
independent. However, the highest temperature considered in
their study was only 1000 K, and, as will be shown in this
study, the elastic modulus of SWNTs becomes temperature
dependent when the temperature of the nanotube is increased
beyond this value.
2. Methodology
This study employs MD simulations to investigate the same
intrinsic thermal behaviour of SWNTs as that observed by
Krishnan et al using TEM [17]. In the present simulations,
the SWNT is modelled as a clamped cantilever beam and
the vibrational amplitude of the tube’s free tip displacement,
u, is obtained as a function of time given a constant tube
temperature. Over a sufficiently long time interval, statistically
meaningful average values of u can be evaluated, together with
their standard deviation σ , whose square is expressed as [17]:
σ 2 = 0.1061L
3kT
Y δR3(1 + (δ/2R)2) , (1)
where L is the tube length, k the Boltzmann constant, T the
tube temperature, Y the Young’s modulus, δ the tube wall
thickness, and R the tube radius. In this study, the standard
deviation results are calculated on the basis of more than 500
periods of the tube’s thermal vibration. Furthermore, the wall
thickness, δ, is assigned the conventional ad hoc value of
0.34 nm, which corresponds to the graphene interlayer spacing
and is widely applied in related studies. It is noted that this
particular choice of δ always results in 0 < δ/2R < 1. Hence,
in equation (1), the term 1 + (δ/2R)2 can be regarded as a
constant with a value between 1 and 2. Therefore, as shown by
equation (1), if the tube temperature, T , and the tube radius, R,
are prescribed as constants, and the tube length, L , is allowed
to vary, a function relating σ 2 and L can be established. If
this relation indicates that σ 2 varies linearly with L3, it can
be inferred that the Young’s modulus is independent of the
tube length. Similarly, if L and T are fixed, and R is allowed
to vary, then the relationship between σ 2 and R indicates the
nature of the relationship between the Young’s modulus and the
tube radius. Likewise, if L and R are fixed, and T is allowed
to vary, the relationship between σ 2 and T characterizes the
temperature dependence of the Young’s modulus.
The present simulations consider SWNTs of length 10–
30 nm, with a zigzag (n, 0) configuration, where n ranges from
7 to 29 (equivalent to tube radii of 0.273 to 1.131 nm). The
nanotube is modelled as a clamped cantilever by imposing four
layers of fixed atoms at one end of the tube while allowing
the remainder of the atoms to vibrate freely. During the
simulations, a constant temperature between 0 and 2000 K
is imposed on the atoms in the SWNT causing an intrinsic
thermal vibration. The corresponding transverse displacements
of the free end of the tube are recorded at each time step. The
empirical Tersoff potential [23–26] is employed to derive the
inter-atomic forces among the carbon atoms of the SWNT.
This particular potential model is chosen since it provides
rapid insights into the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the NT
without the need to consider chemical reactions. Furthermore,
Raravikar et al have reported that the Tersoff potential model
provides a suitable means of investigating the temperature
dependence of the radial breathing mode Raman frequency
of SWNTs in the case where the formation or breakage of
carbon–carbon bonds does not take place [27]. The motion
of each carbon atom is governed by Newton’s Laws of motion,
in which the resultant force acting on each atom is deduced
from the energy potential related to its interactions with
neighbouring atoms within a prescribed cut-off radius. The

Figure 3. Variation of Young’s modulus as function of tube
temperature for zigzag (n, 0) SWNT with n = 7, 9, 12, 14, 17, 19

almost identical. The open circles indicate the variation of the
Young’s modulus of an armchair (5, 5) SWNT. A close agreement is
observed between these results and those of the zigzag (9, 0) SWNT.
indicate that the Young’s modulus has a constant value when
the tube temperature is lower than approximately 1100 K, but
decreases rapidly with increasing tube temperature at higher
temperatures. Furthermore, as the tube radius increases, the
temperature variation curves tend to converge, as predicted
by figure 2. In other words, irrespective of the SWNT
temperature, the variation of the Young’s modulus with the
tube radius is consistent with that shown in figure 2. The
temperature at which a significant reduction in the Young’s
modulus occurs represents a transition point at which the
nanotube begins to become elastically weaker. It is noted
that the transition temperatures shown in figure 3 for the
various SWNTs are approximately equal. Therefore, it can be
inferred that the transition temperature is insensitive to the tube
radius. Finally, it is observed that even at an extremely high
temperature, e.g. 2000 K, the ‘small’ Young’s modulus value
of approximately 0.9 TPa obtained for the largest radius tube
is still significantly higher than that of other known materials.
Figure 3 also presents the temperature dependence of the
armchair (5, 5) SWNT, whose radius is approximately equal
to that of the zigzag (9, 0) SWNT. As shown, the temperature
dependence of the Young’s modulus of the armchair nanotube
is very similar to that of the zigzag (9, 0) SWNT. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the elastic modulus of an SWNT is
insensitive to its helicity.
Figure 3 provides no more than a broad estimate of the
transition temperature. To determine the threshold temperature
more precisely, this study examined the correlation function
of the bond angles, θ , among the sp2-bonded carbon atoms of
the SWNT. To calculate the angular correlation function (ACF)
of an SWNT, it is necessary to measure three bond angles of
each carbon atom other than those located at the ends of the
tube. Hence, if N atoms are considered, then the correlation
function calculation involves a total of 3N bond angles. For
an SWNT, although the individual bond angle, θ , varies over

identical, and hence σθ is thought to be radius independent. Note the
rapid increase in the standard deviation at the transition temperature
of 1100 K.
time, the ACF of the SWNT remains approximately constant
during the thermal vibration period. Averaging the individual
bond angles over the N atoms involved in the ACF evaluation
and calculating the corresponding standard deviation, σθ , it is
found that the former is insensitive to the tube temperature,
whereas the latter is temperature dependent. However, the
standard deviation of the tube’s ACF is independent of both
the tube radius and the tube length.
Figure 4 presents a typical variation of the standard
deviation, σθ , as a function of the tube temperature. It is
observed that σθ varies linearly with the tube temperature and
that the standard deviation increases rapidly at the specific
transition temperature, i.e. 1100 K. Therefore, it can be
hypothesized that the significant reduction in the Young’s
modulus that occurs at the transition temperature can be
attributed to a sudden change in the standard deviation, σθ .
In other words, a sudden change of σθ can be regarded as
indicating the threshold point at which a phase transformation
of the SWNT takes place.
4. Conclusions
To summarize, this study has used MD simulations to
investigate the intrinsic thermal vibration of SWNTs modelled
as clamped elastic cantilevers. The vibrational amplitude of the
tube’s free tip displacement has been recorded on a periodic
basis, and the standard deviation of the tip displacement
evaluated. Using the principles of elastic theory modelled
by equation (1), the Young’s moduli of various SWNTs
have been established. The present study can be regarded
as the numeric equivalent of the experimental investigation
undertaken by Krishnan et al [17]. To the best of the
current authors’ knowledge, this study represents the first
occasion that a numerical investigation into the temperature
dependence of the Young’s modulus of SWNTs has been
reported. The advantage of evaluating the Young’s modulus
