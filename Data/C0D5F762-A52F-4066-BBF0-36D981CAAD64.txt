far as the author is aware of has been dedicated to work on the design of push services such as 
MMS(multimedia messaging services) in overlay network. Thus, this project will integrate the 
features of overlay networking and P2P resource discovery technologies to develop a high 
performance decentralized multimedia service platform to fulfill current need of Internet.  
The P2P based service platform will be based on the Internet control signal protocol SIP. The 
platform will include SIP P2P system, push multimedia services, and integrated synchronous and 
asynchronous multimedia multicasting services with the assistance of SIP resource search. The 
project will exploit novel idea such as locality aware P2P topology, hybrid structured resource 
discovery, soft state tracking, soft state routing and pushing, network coding and segment-based 
cache replacement strategies to bootstrap the performance of decentralized multimedia services. 
After the completion of the project, we expect to implement a prototype of the platform and some 
pilot applications such as MMS and VoD to illustrate the performance of our platform.

coding and without network coding.
multimedia streaming services. These multimedia stream-
ing systems can be classified into three categories: tree-
based streaming systems, mesh-based streaming systems,
and coding-based streaming system.
Tree-based streaming systems concatenate all partici-
pants to form multicast trees for streaming video and audio
data [1–4]. [4] proves the advantage of buffer capacities of
end hosts under application-layered multicasting environ-
ments. In [4], every participant in a streaming system has a
fix-sized buffer to store used streaming data for supporting
later incoming participants by sending data without involv-
ing the VOD server.
Mesh-based streaming systems outspread peers’ links to
different individual peers and retrieval streaming data from
their links in a parallel downloading fashion [4,5]. By using
the additional links, the high availability of acquired data is
expected.
In coding-based streaming system, codices are exploited
for accelerating the process of streaming data download.
[7, 8] use the erasure codes [9, 10] to achieve efficient bulk
data download. Moreover, a novel coding technology, net-
work coding [11, 12], can be regarded as a variant of gen-
eralized Digital Fountain approach [9]. Erasure codes can
divide data into m blocks and generate m (1 + β) coded
blocks on a source peer. Then, receivers must collect mγ
distinct coded blocks to reconstruct the entire data. In net-
work coding, a code can be combined with many other
codes, and the sequential order of received codes is insignif-
icant for recover the original data.
2.2 Network Coding
Network coding technology was first proposed by
Ahlswede et al. [9]. Network coding technology can
save bandwidth and promote throughput utilization. It re-
gards the information flows in a network topology as trans-
formable flows by coding at peer nodes, rather than individ-
ual isolated ones. Later, Li et al [14, 15] proposed an ef-
fective coding scheme by using the linear algebra. This lin-
ear network coding scheme (LNC) formulates the behavior
Figure 2. The schema of peer-to-peer stream-
ing framework.
of multicast diagram which regards data chunks as vector-
added linear transformations in a topology.
Figure 1 presents the concept of network coding. In
case A, without network coding, the source S needs to send
packets a and b twice for completing transmission due to
the bandwidth constraints. In case B, with network cod-
ing, source S only sends packets a and b for once, and node
Ca combines packets a and b by a network coding scheme.
Then node Ca sends packet (a + b) to relay node Rc. Fi-
nally, the receiver T1 and T2 can recovery packets a and b
by decoding (a + b) and a (or b). Observably, the through-
put and bandwidth utilization in case B is higher than that
in case A.
3 The Architecture of PNECOS
This section describes the design concept and system ar-
chitecture of PNECOS. PNECOS is composed of four com-
ponents: 1) Isochronic Content Time Interval Unit (ITIU),
which is a short clip of a media object for encoding and
transferring; 2) 2-phased ITIU-LNC based circular buffer,
which caches the received ITIUs and supports new incom-
ing clients without the VOD server; 3) centralized code
distribution, which regulates the code dissemination by us-
ing linear network coding (LNC); 4) Media Distribution
Tree (MDT), which is proposed by oStream [6] to construct
streaming trees in a distributed way.
3.1 Basic Concept
In a peer-to-peer streaming system, each end host may
become a light-weighted proxy to reduce the bandwidth
consumption of the VOD server by allocating a buffer space
to cache data. If a new client acquires streaming data, pre-
decessor end hosts can serve as hosts to stream the client
when the acquired data exists in their buffer spaces.
Figure 2 shows a general diagram of a peer-to-peer
streaming system. Generally, streaming data is divided into
380
Figure 3. The diagram of MDG (a) and MDT
(b).
VOD server is the default server for all requests. Every re-
quest peer has edges that connected from all reachable pre-
decessors which have cached streaming data to support this
request peer. This graph called MDG. As shown in Fig.
3(a), peer R3 can be supported by R1 and S, but R4 is only
supported by S. After constructing a minimum spanning
tree (MST) from the MDG, a MDT is ready to be built and
media data can be streamed from the streaming server.
PNECOS can provide raw ITIUs and coded ITIUs to re-
quest peers. For participants, a peer acquires coded ITIUs
means that it must spend more computing power to decode
the coded ITIUs. However, PNECOS may assign the peer
to acquire coded ITIUs from other peers due to the using of
minimum spanning tree algorithm as in oStream [6], even
though one or more sources can forward raw ITIUs to this
new request peer. It is because the difference between all
qualified parent candidates is only their distances to the new
request peer in oStream.
Therefore, picking a suitable parent from candidate peers
can not only rely on the physical characteristic, such as RTT
(Round Trip Time) or hop count, but also the difference be-
tween raw ITIU buffer and coded ITIU buffer must be taken
into consideration. Thus, PNECOS extended the distributed
algorithms in [6] to maintain MDT: MDT-Insert and MDT-
Delete. MDT-Insert and MDT-Delete are executed when a
new request arrives and an existing request leaves, respec-
tively.
The difference between the original MDT-Insert/MDT-
Delete and the modified ones is in the selection procedure.
In the original MDT-Insert/MDT-Delete, the VOD server
and other candidates are selected based on their link cost.
In PNECOS, the VOD server is selected only when required
media data has no sufficient source. The proposed selection
procedure is divided into 3 phases:
1. Pick a parent ranged in the ITIU buffer length. To
avoid the complicated decoding process, the acquired
request should connect to a raw ITIU source as possi-
ble as it can. The reason to exclude the VOD server

from candidate set is to provide a chance for the re-
quest peer to use coded ITIUs from other sources.
2. If no parent is found for raw data download service,
pick ω coded parents ranged in the coded ITIU buffer
length, where ω denotes the member of dimension
used in the network coding. In this phase, the VOD
server is included for candidate selection.
3. Complement the rest of needed coded ITIUs by us-
ing the VOD server. If the acquired request only gets
one coded parent, it means no other source peer, ex-
cept the VOD server can provide needed coded ITIUs.
Therefore, assign the VOD server to be its parent for
coded ITIU streaming. If less than ω but larger than
one coded parents are found, The VOD server is also
used to complement the rest of needed coded ITIUs.
Notably, with the modified MDT-Insert and MDT-
Delete, PNECOS is not using a minimum spanning tree. It
causes larger latency in receiving streaming data. However,
since appropriate parents or coded parents are allocated to
every acquired request, the workload of the VOD server is
substantially reduced.
4 Performance Evaluation
4.1 Simulation Environment
We evaluate the performance of PNECOS in terms of
Server Bandwidth Consumption (SBC) by computer simu-
382
As demonstrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, SBC becomes
much small when ω increasing. The effect is especially ap-
parent while using whole buffer to store coded ITIUs. For
each curve in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, the peak of a curve indi-
cates the maximal volume of SBC. As discovered in oS-
tream [6], these peaks denote the thresholds that the ex-
pected length of streaming trees starts to overcome intervals
between individual requests and enable to concatenate them
after corresponding arrival rates. Obviously, in Fig. 4 and
Fig. 5, when R is decreasing, the peak of curve would shift
from right to left. This phenomenon shows that the effective
buffer length is indeed prolonged by using network coding.
5 Conclusion
This work proposes a Peer-to-peer NEtwork COding
based Streaming architecture (PNECOS). PNECOS ex-
ploits the storage feature of network coding to extend the
effective buffer length and simplify the data downloading
process. In PNECOS, network coding provides a solution
to recover encoded data without noticing the sequential or-
der and reduce storage space by blending and distributing
the data information into all divided data parts. We com-
pare PNECOS with oStream system by computer simula-
tion in terms of server bandwidth consumption. Simulation
results show that with network coding, the effective buffer
length of peers can be extended by reducing storage spaces
for coded content, and the server bandwidth consumption
can be reduced.

ABNC. The ABNC user profile extends current ABC pro-
file to include network connection preference. Also, a net-
work selection information service (NSIS) based on MIH
(Media Independent Handover) [2] is proposed to collect
attributes, such as network utilization, reliability and band-
width, of local access networks for each handset. Then SIP
and its embedded SDP protocol [3] are extended to support
information acquisition of destination access networks.
To achieve ABNC, the problem of ABNC is formulated
as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem
based on the user profile and attributes of all candidate net-
work connections. In this study, analytic hierarchy process
(AHP) [4] is applied to solve the MCDM problem. AHP
recommends a network connection based on weights of var-
ious criteria of network connections derived from user’s
profiles in handsets and relative weights of candidate net-
work connections. Finally a simple example is illustrated to
demo how ABNC is achieved through our novel design.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
2 reviews related work. Section 3 formulates the problem
of ABNC. Section 4 describes the enabling mechanism for
ABNC. Section 5 presents weighting of network connec-
tion criteria and alternatives in AHP. A simple example is
also illustrated to show how AHP works. Finally, section 6
concludes the paper and discusses future works.
2 Related Work
There is a growing number of research efforts concern-
ing ABC service. For example, [1, 5] described concept
and architecture of an ABC solution. Given a set of flows,
researchers [6] model ABC as a knapsack problem while
[7] formulates ABC as a variant of bin packing problem
and presents a series of approximation algorithms based on
First Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithms. While [8] intends
to achieve ABC over WLAN and WiMAX by using a new
mechanism to detect QoS support of the underlie networks,
other researches [9] consider both user preference and at-
tributes of access networks and formulate ABC as a prob-
lem of MCDM.
When selecting a network, many factors, such as RSS
(Received Signal Strength), preferred access network type,
monetary cost of services, QoS requirements of applica-
tions, etc., have been considered. In [10] and [11], a cost-
function is defined over the some of above mentioned at-
tributes. They used weight to represent the importance of
considered parameters. Instead of using cost functions to
select networks, a rule-based mechanism is proposed in
[12]. First, the RSS value is used to estimate access proba-
bility and then a formula for computing residual bandwidth
is used to estimate if a new network can provide required
bandwidth. The aforementioned work, however, has mainly
focus on selection of an access network based on QoS re-
quirement of an application. Although end-to-end delay is
also considered as an attribute of an access network, they
obviously use a coarse-grain paradigm for network con-
nections, i.e., source handset and its correspondent handset
communicate with a homogeneous network type.
Recently, 3GPP is making an effort in supporting dual-
mode handsets of WiFi and cellular systems for voice com-
munication. The Voice Call Continuity (VCC) project [13]
is one of 3GPP solutions in providing seamless voice com-
munication for dual-mode handsets. However, so far no
concrete agreement has been reached in selecting a net-
work domain for a voice session. The work of VCC, how-
ever, confirms that it is imperative for us to use a finer-
grain paradigm for voice communication between multi-
mode handsets.
3 ABNC Problem Formulation
Voice communication is associated with several impor-
tant attributes that are most concerned by users. This sec-
tion described first the attributes of an access network and
then specifies the characteristics of a voice session that are
considered important in many current studies [1, 5, 7]. Fi-
nally, the problem of ABNC is formulated as a multi-criteria
decision making (MCDM) problem.
3.1 Access Network Attributes
An access network Ai is described using a six-tuple
(PFi, FLi, Pi, SLi, Qi, Ui) where PFi, FLi, Pi, SLi, Qi,
Ui, denote the access network profile, frame lost rate, power
consumption rate, security level, QoS provisioning level
and network utilization of Ai respectively.
3.1.1 Access Network Profile
Access network profile PFi includes operator identi-
fier (op), network type (nt) and current link band-
width for a user (bw) of Ai. opi represents the
ownership of Ai, which is globally unique. nti ∈
{GSM,PHS,UMTS,WiMAX,WLAN, · · · } denotes
the radio access technology of Ai. bwi specifies the link
bandwidth currently achievable through the network inter-
face card (NIC) of Ai. For example, if the NIC supports
802.11b, bwi could be 1, 2, 5.5, or 11Mbps depending on
the RSS detected by the handset.
3.1.2 Frame Lost Rate
Frame lost rate FLi indicates the reliability of Ai. It is ob-
vious that before a handset gets access to Ai, the handset
has no way of measuring FLi. Thus, FLi is usually calcu-
lated or mapped from the RSS detected by the NIC of Ai.

such as WLAN are poor in security and hence users’ pri-
vacy protection. Thus, the privacy level of voice session
SLij = SL (Sij) is a Boolean variable and is equal to
SL
(
ASi
) ∧ SL (ACj ).
3.2.5 Stability
Quality stability (QS) is a real number between 0 and one.
It relates to the level of QoS provisioning to a voice ses-
sion. Obviously, an access network with Qi resource allo-
cation mechanism, such as WiMAX and GSM, can offer
better stability. On the other hand, WLAN, which does
not allocate bandwidth for users, cannot promise stable
level of QoS for a voice session. Thus, we assume that if
Q
(
ASi
)∧Q (ACj ) = TRUE,QS = 1. If either Q (ASi ) or
Q
(
ACj

3.3 ABNC Problem Definition
When a user makes a phone call, the ABNC service will
make a decision to set up a voice session with the corre-
spondent user. As described in the previous section, a voice
session is associated with five attributes. Thus, we formu-
late the ABNC problem as follows:
Problem Definition: Given source handset S and corre-
spondent handset C. S has m interfaces to access networks
ASi , where 0 < i ≤ m. C has n interfaces to access
networks ACj , where 0 < j ≤ n. There exist m × n
candidate network connections Sij =
(
ASi , A
C
j
)
, where
0 < i ≤ m and 0 < j ≤ n. Each Sij has attributes
(Cij , Pij , Rij , SLij , QSij). The score of each candidate
network connection Sij is obtained by adding the normal-
ized contribution from each metric multiplied by the impor-
tance weight assigned based on user preference. Let CB be
the set whose elements are adequate when they are bigger
than a threshold Tb, such as bandwidth. Let CS be the set
whose elements are adequate when they are smaller than a

threshold Ts, such as delay. Therefore, the network connec-
tion selection can be formulated as a multi-criteria decision
making problem as follows:
S∗nc=argMAX(wcCij+wpPij+wrRij+wslSLij+wqsQSij) ,
(5)
s.t. CB > Tb and CS > Ts, (6)
where 0 < i ≤ m, 0 < j ≤ n. Tb and Ts are the thresholds
defined by the user.
4 ABNC Enabling Mechanisms
This section presents an ABNC user profile and the net-
work services and required to enable ABNC in 4G wireless
network. The ABNC profile includes user’s preference and
constraint in selecting a network connection. The network
services mainly include two parts: attribute collection of
local access networks with assistance of MIH Network Se-
lection Information Services (NSIS) and acquisition of at-
tributes of the access networks attached by a handset and the
correspondent handset through extension of SIP and SDP.
4.1 VoIP ABNC User Profile
A user defines the preference and constraint of network
connections through a user profile. Based on the user pro-
file, ABNC chooses a network connection available to the
best interest of users. Fig. 1 shows the prototype of a VoIP
ABNC user profile. In Fig. 1, a user profile is divided into
two parts, system and net. The former includes general con-
figuration and QoS requirements of a user for his/her voice
communications. There are three parameters in the general
configuration, network criteria priority and power thresh-
old. Network criteria priority defines the attribute priority,
including cost, quality, power consumption, privacy and sta-
bility in selecting a network connection. Based on the pri-
ority selected by users, weights are assigned to respective

the quantitative results are obvious and can meet the engi-
neering demands.
AHP has three steps for considering decision problems:
1) constructing hierarchies, 2) pair-wise comparisons, and
3) synthesis of priorities.
In the first step, AHP structures a problem as a hierar-
chy of multiple criteria. The decision factors of the prob-
lem are inserted into the hierarchy. The overall objective,
i.e., ABNC, is placed at the topmost node of the hierarchy.
The subsequent nodes represent the five attributes: Cost (C),
Power consumption (P), quality (R), Security Level (SL)
and Quality Stability (QS). The solution alternatives are lo-
cated at the bottom nodes. Fig. 3 is composed of 3 levels
for ABNC. Therefore, in the method proposed by this re-
search, there are three types of selection parameters: goal
G, evaluation criteria set Ccriteria, and the alternative set
Salternative as defined below:
The goal G is to select the suitable network. The evalua-
tion criteria set Ccriteria refers to the attributes of a voices
session and is defined as {Cost (C), Power consumption (P),
Quality (R), Security Level (SL) and Quality Stability (QS)
}.
To illustrate how AHP works, we show a simple example
for voice communication between source and correspon-
dent handsets, each with three interfaces, WLAN, UMTS
and GPRS. Thus, we have 9 candidate network connec-
tions for voice communication between them. Due to page
limit of the paper, we assume strength order between net-

work connection candidates instead of going through de-
tailed computation of various criteria in the following de-
scription.
Assume after eliminating un-qualified alternatives, the
feasible alternative set Salternative = {S11: WLAN-
WLAN, S12: WLAN-UMTS, S13: WLAN-GPRS, S22:
UMTS-UMTS, S23: UMTS-GPRS, S33: GPRS-GPRS}.
They are candidate networks.
The second step is the evaluation stage where each factor
is compared to all other factors within the same parent. As
shown in Table 3, a fundamental 1 to 9 scale is used in AHP
to allow a user to express the strength of preference based
on his intuition, experience, and knowledge. Then scales
are assigned to a judge matrix R which weights the strength
between criteria based on user’s input.
The judge matrix R = (rij)n×n, and rij > 0, rii =
1, rij = 1/rij , (i, j = 1, 2, · · ·n), rij is the ratio of element
i and j. To automate scale assignment for R, a simple map-
ping scheme which takes input of user’s priority on crite-
rion in the user profile is invoked. In this scheme, a matrix
R with criteria ranked with user’s preference in decreas-
ing strength order is generated. For example, if the rank
of cost C is higher than the rank of power consumption P
(C > P ), C is placed at lower number of column and row
of R. Then, the first row R [1] is assigned scales {1, 3, 5, 7,
9}. A shift-right operator Srk is defined as follows to assign
scales for the rest of R [1], n ≥ i > 1.
Srk (R [i]) =
{
R [j] |j = i+ k, rjl = ri(l−k), n ≥ l > j
}
.
(7)
rij is then calculated as rij = 1/rji, where j > i. Table 4
illustrates an example with criteria strength order C > P >
R > SL > SQ.
In AHP, a judge matrix R must be consistent. R is con-
sistent if rij = rik/rjk, (i, j, k = 1, 2, · · ·n) and its maxi-
mal latent root λmax = n, otherwise, it is inconsistent, i.e.,

Best Network Connection (ABNC) paradigm to address this
issue. We then formulate ABNC as a Multi-Criteria Deci-
sion Making (MCDM) problem. The enabling mechanisms
for ABNC including user profiles, SIP and SDP extension,
and information service based on MIH, are also briefly in-
troduced. Finally, with user’s preference and attributes of
network connections, AHP is applied to choose a best net-
work connection for users.
While this paper has presented work flow of ABNC, de-
tailed control signaling, such as SIP and SDP extension,
needs to be devised to make ABNC work efficiently. Also,
the paper does not present simulation of performance for
a resulted network connection. Thus, we will continue to
work on these issues to make ABNC a reality.

MC-MR WMNs with centralized control and present a linear 
programming algorithm to find the upper and lower bounds. 
Using the deterministic model given in [4], Kodialam and 
Nandagopal [5] provided an experimental verification for the 
result given by [3]. Wang and Liu [6]  formulate an integer 
linear programming problem to find capacity for MC-MR 
WMNs. However, [4] [5] and [6] do not provide analytical 
analysis.  
For inter-flow capacity analysis, [7]-[12] show that per-node 
capacity reduces to (1/ )O n  in 802.11 WMNs. The reason for 
the poor performance of inter-flow compared to that of 
intra-flow in WMNs is mainly due to the hot spot at BS that 
throttles the throughput of each node in the network [7]. Even 
though [7]-[12] have focused on the inter-flow capacity of 
WMNs, their results are based on the random access MAC 
without centralized scheduling. 
Jun and Sichitiu [7] use an idea of Bottleneck Collision 
Domain (BCD), and Malekesmaeili et al.  [8] use a similar idea 
of Collision Domain (CD), to predict inter-flow capacity of a 
WMN. Different from [7] and [8], Wu et al. [9] use the queuing 
model to estimate inter-flow capacity of a WMN. Due to the 
presence of bottlenecks near BS, they both obtain the inter-flow 
per-node capacity. Unlike them, we use the viewpoint of 
scheduling to evaluate the inter-flow capacity.  Miorando and 
Granelli [10] present an analytical expression of capacity using 
the concept of BCD in [7]. However, the result in [10] depends 
only on the number of nodes in n-hop neighbors of BS, while 
we consider not only the number of nodes but also transmission 
range and network radius. Besides, we believe that BCD in [6] 
is pessimistic, thus we define an optimistic concept of 
Bottleneck Collision Area (BCA). By implementing the 
algorithm in [4] and BCD in [7], the simulation results show 
that using BCA obtains higher upper bound than using BCD, 
and using algorithm in [4] gets quite close to our BCA 
analytical upper bound.  
Even though [7]-[12] focus on the inter-flow capacity of 
WMNs, their results do not consider the effect of transmission 
power and network radius. To the best of our knowledge, this is 
the first paper addressing the model of inter-flow capacity 
coupled with transmission power and network radius. 
III. SYSTEM MODEL 
A. Assumptions 
We consider nodes that are randomly located on a planar 
circle of constant density and adopt the protocol model 
proposed by [2]. The interference range is defined 
as (1 )f p= + Δ , where p is the transmission range and ǻ is the 
guard zone factor, which is affected by channel condition, PHY 
scheme, and the ability of antenna. A node can receive 
successfully only if the sending node is within p and no other 
nodes within f are sending simultaneously. Although we restrict 
ǻ to 0 1< Δ ≤  in this paper, our analysis can be easily extended 
to any range of ǻ. In this paper, two nodes having the longest 
feasible communication link are denoted as p-link, since they 
are exactly p range apart. The interference-avoidance MAC 
scheme used in this study is the symmetric scheme, i.e., 802.11 
RTS-CTS-DATA-ACK scheme, in which, any node 
overhearing RTS or CTS defers transmitting, i.e. protecting 
both the sender and the receiver. 
B. Network Model 
A network model of a slotted SC-SR WMN, similar to that 
defined by Mergen and Tong [12], is adopted in this work. In a 
slotted WMN, every transmission must be pre-scheduled and 
assigned a timeslot. A schedule İ is a matrix with entry İl for all 
l L∈ , where L is the set of all links, and İl is a set of serial 
timeslots assigned to link l and represented by a set of positive 
integers.  
The period of schedule İ is defined as 
( ) max max
ll L t
Period t

where t is the entry of İl. Thus, an admissible schedule is 
defined as follows. 
Definition 1 
 A schedule İ is admissible if and only if the following 
conditions are satisfied:  
1) İl has no duplicate timeslots for all l L∈ , and  
2) Schedule İ follows either symmetric or asymmetric MAC. 

where |İl| is the number of timeslots assigned to İl  and W is the

IV. ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS
A. Scheduling-Based Method 
Eq. (2) illustrates that different schedule can obtain different 
capacity. Thus, we need to find a good schedule to estimate the 
capacity of WMNs. Usually, an inter-flow traffic between an SS 
and BS includes several link traffics. Thus, we can convert all 
inter-flow traffic into link traffic demands. Under the 
assumption of uniform inter-flow traffic demand, if a schedule 
assigns exact number of timeslots to fit the traffic demand of 
each link, then each inter-flow will have equal throughput. Thus, 
we can get the uniform capacity easily: 
Theorem 1
If a schedule İ assigns Tl timeslots to every link l, i.e., 
    l lT l Lε = ∀ ∈ , the uniform per-node inter-flow capacity with 
schedule İ must satisfy

Note that we assume equal rate for uplink and downlink flow. 
By Theorem 1, we can use a scheduling-based method to 
obtain the capacity of a WMN.

Thus dreuse(lA,B, lC,D) = p + f  < 2p + f.          
Lemma 2
With n approaching infinity and use of the shortest-path 
routing in a uniformly distributed random topology, a collision 
area CA is maximal when it is centered on a BS, and the CA is 
the area of a circle with radius / 2reused .         
Proof
 As n approaches infinity and is uniformly distributed, the use 
of the shortest-path routing started from non-BS nodes 
will make all links except those originated from the BS a p-link. 
Thus, making the BS as a center, there always exist, at all 
possible radian, two p-links on a line such as links lA,B and lC,D
shown in Fig. 2(a) and the BS is at the middle of AD . Based on 
Lemma 1, a circle based on the BS with radius dreuse /2 can 
include all p-links that cannot transmit simultaneously.  If the 
circle is not centered at a BS, there exists at least two p-links not 
on a line, as in Fig. 2(b). Thus  a smaller area than a circle with 
radius dreuse /2 can include both p-links lA,B and lC,D.    
Definition 4 
A bottleneck collision area (BCA) is defined as a CA with 
the maximum traffic load.               
Since we assume all links in a BCA cannot transmit 
simultaneously, the minimum length of a scheduling period is 
limited by the traffic load in the BCA. Therefore the BCA 
traffic load can determine the upper bound of network capacity. 
So the question next is how to determine the position and size 
of the BCA in a WMN. 
Based on Lemma 1 and 2, in this work, we assume the BCA 
for a WMN is centered at the BS and with the radius 
/ 2bottleneck reuseR d= . It is obvious that not all links are p-links, 
thus, it is possible that more than one link in the BCA can 
transmit simultaneously. However, the BCA is much tighter 
than that defined by BCD [7] for deriving the capacity upper 
bound. Thus, our results represent a tighter capacity upper 
bound for WMNs. 
Based on the definition of BCA, we are able to calculate the 
traffic load of the BCA. A BCA with radius Rbottleneck may 
include multiple rings. In order to determine how many rings 
are included in a BCA, we need to determine the range of 
Rbottleneck first. Obviously, the radius of a BCA has a limited 
region as 
2bottleneckp R p< < (6)
Thus, a BCA covers links in at most two rings and its traffic 
load Tbottleneck comprises the 1-hop traffic and part of 2-hop 
traffic that is covered by CAB as follows: 
1 2 Bbottleneck hop hop CA
T T T
− − ∩= + (7)
where CAB is the converge of the BCA and 2 Bhop CAT − ∩  is the 
traffic load of the intersection of CAB and Ring2. In a uniformly 
distributed topology, the number of links is proportional to the 
converge area. Thus, we obtain the following equation:

where Ak-hop is the area that cover 1-hop to k-hop nodes and 
Abottleneck is the area of the BCA. Because all inter-flows will be 
forwarded to BS, the traffic of 1-hop link is 
1- 2hopT n= (9)
The 2-hop nodes need not relay the flow of 1-hop nodes, so the 
traffic of 2-hop nodes is 
2- 1- 1-2hop hop hopT T n= − (10)
where n1-hop is the number of 1-hop nodes. In a random topology 
with n nodes uniformly distributed in an area with radius d,
n1-hop is equal to 2( / )p d n . Thus we obtain

Rbottleneck is affected by the transmission range p, i.e., Rbottleneck/p
is a constant when given a MAC protocol and the interference 
range. To simplify the equation, we define a constant x = 
Rbottleneck/p. Then we get Rbottleneck = x p and the equation above 
can be simplified: 
This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communications Society subject matter experts for publication in the WCNC 2008 proceedings.
Consider the relationship between the number of SSs and 
capacity. Fig. 6 shows that the estimated total capacity by the 
algorithm presented in [4] gets close to that of analytic analysis 
when the number of SSs increases. This is because our analytic 
analysis assumes that the number of node is infinite; SSs are 
highly populated in an area. If the number of SSs is small, the 
real capacity becomes small. Thus, the estimated capacity by 
the algorithm presented in [4] is close to that of the analytic 
analysis when the density of SSs becomes large. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We re-define the bottleneck collision domain (BCD) 
proposed by [7] to a bottleneck collision area (BCA) that 
enables us to achieve a tighter capacity upper bound. In a WMN 
with a uniformly distributed random topology, the shortest-path 
routing and centralized scheduling are used, and n approaches 
infinity in a given area, Theorem 2 gives a closed-form 
expression of capacity upper bound. With a fixed transmission 
range and a fixed network radius, the inter-flow capacity can be 
expressed as ( / )O W n , same as [7]. Our simulation results show 
the capacity of our analysis is much larger than that of the BCD 
algorithm because we consider the centralized global 
scheduling on BS.  
Simulation results show that our analytic results are very 
close to that derived by the existing algorithm given by [4] with 
the symmetric MAC. Thus, our results can be readily used in 
WMN network planning. With simple extension of the number 
of parallel non-interfered links in a BCA, this method can also 
be applied to any MC-MR WMN with non-uniform traffic. 
Many interesting issues are worthwhile for further 
investigation from this work. First, the nodes in WMNs may 
transmit with non-uniform rates. Second, the effects of 
increasing the transmission range are opposite for inter-flow 
and intra-flow. How to configure the optimal transmission range 
for WMNs is also an important issue that needs further study.

scheme called Dynamic MRSS (DMRSS) algorithm is pro-
posed to address this issue. Extensive simulation exper-
iments were conducted to study performance of our pre-
sented algorithms. The simulation results show that MRSS
and DMRSS can substantially improve the motion detection
delay and be exploited by a handoff algorithm to reduce un-
necessary handoff and save power.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section
2 discusses related network discovery scheme. Section 3
details the proposed Momentum-based Motion Detection
Methodology. Section 4 summarizes the simulation results
and compares the performance of various design options.
Finally, Section 5 draws conclusions.
2 Related Work
In the past, many network discovery approaches have
been proposed. Those approaches can be divided into three
categories: reactive, proactive and location-aware method.
The proactive network discovery uses a decision func-
tion based on a handoff mechanism [1–9]. [6] uses a dwell
timer and an effective throughput ratio to optimize the RSS-
based handoff algorithm while reducing the ping-pong ef-
fect. [9] proposes a predict RSS and adaptive cost-based
competitive on-line (COL) method to trigger handoff and
select a suitable wireless network. The predicted RSS is
equal to current RSS plus difference value between an ex-
ponential averaged RSS and an averaged RSS. If the predict
RSS is below a predefined threshold, the handoff will be
triggered. However, these handoff algorithms do not con-
sider the power consumption of wireless technology.
The reactive approaches use predefined thresholds to
trigger a MN’s network discovery [10–12] so that the MN
can preserve battery power. In [10], the authors discussed
network discovery by using Link Going Down (LDG) trig-
ger in the Media Independent Handover (MIH) framework
[13]. LDG is an event message that is triggered by an
MIH Information Service (IS) according to the threshold
used. LDG can be invoked by various approaches to pre-
vent ping-pong effect. [11] proposes an Application Signal
Strength Threshold (ASST) mechanism, which defines dif-
ferent thresholds for applications. When the RSS slope es-
timation is smaller than ASST, network discovery is trig-
gered. However, when many applications are active on a
MN at the same time, how to define thresholds is a prob-
lem.
The authors in [12] presented an NDMD algorithm to
enable MN’s interfaces when the MN is moving away from
its current BS. The authors claim that NDMD can reduce 30
percent of battery power consumption than that of always-
on approach. However, the motion detection algorithm
adopted in NDMD is insensitive, especially, when the MN
is far away from the BS or moves with a slow speed. There-
fore, its smoothing factors must be tuned accordingly for
various wireless networks.
Network discovery can also be invoked with the assis-
tance of location information, offered by indoor or outdoor
location systems [14–20]. Based on the location informa-
tion provided by GPS, location servers or location-aware
base stations, a MN can activate or terminate its interfaces
in an appropriate time to save battery power. However, the
location-aware based network discovery method requires
extra hardware and may not work well in an indoor envi-
ronment.
3 MRSS Algorithm
In this section, the proposed Momentum of Received
Signal Strength (MRSS) algorithm for network discovery
is described.
3.1 MRSS Definition
Received Signal Strength (RSS) depends on a MN’s
speeds, distances between the MN and its base station (BS),
radio propagation models and channel fading. In a real
world, the surrounding environment is always changing and
hence RSS also changes continually. Thus, RSS cannot ac-
curately represent a MN’s motion. For example, when a
MN moves around in an indoor environment, the multi-path
fading causes the same radio signal arriving to the MN at
different time and paths, and leads to big diverge of RSS. It
is necessary to filter these fading noises.
MRSS is set as the difference between current smoothed
RSS and early smoothed RSS samples. The computation
process of MRSS can be divided into three steps. First, an
Averaged RSS (ARSS) [21] is computed, which takes an
average value of RSS’es of T samples, as follows:
ARSSi =
∑T
j=1 RSSi×T+j
T
, (1)
where i > 0, T > 0. ARSSi is the average of RSS samples
in the ith interval of time.
In the second step, an Exponential Moving Average
(EMA) [21] is used to smooth ARSS, which is calculated
as follows:
EMAi = (1− α)× EMAi−1 + α×ARSSi, (2)
where i ≥ 1. The smooth factor (α) can filter noise of
ARSS and keep EMA stable. The EMA curve becomes
more stable when EMA uses a smaller smooth factor (α),
which is called Long-term EMA (LEMA) and can pre-
dict the trend of a MN’s motion; on the other hand, when
EMA uses a larger smooth factor, which is called Short-
term EMA (SEMA), the SEMA curve changes quickly and
812

at different MN’s motions. In the stationary state, the EMA
curve is relatively stable and hence using a small ∆t can
allow us to detect the MN’s motion quickly. In the moving
state, on the other hand, when the EMA curve diverges sig-
nificantly, we use a large ∆t to enlarge MRSS values and
make us detect the changes of the MN’s behavior quickly.
This is because using a small ∆t will generate a small
MRSS value, which makes it difficult to detect the MN’s
motion changes.
3.4 Network Discovery Triggering
Figure 3 shows the flow chart of DMRSS. When EMA is
below the network discovery threshold THND, the MRSS
value is compared with THP and THN . According to
the comparison results, one of these operation modes is se-
lected:
Figure 4. The deployment of overlap WLAN.
• NON ND mode: In this mode, the MN is approaching
the AP. The network discovery is unneeded.
• SEMI ND mode: In this mode, the MN stays at the
same place and is in the stationary state.
• ND mode: In this mode, the MN can turn on all its
interfaces to do network discovery.
4 Simulation Results
Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance
of MRSS and DMRSS in the detection delay. Also perfor-
mance of handoff algorithms based on NDMD [12], MRSS,
DMRSS and RSS threshold with Dwell-Timer are simu-
lated and compared in number of failure handoff and accu-
mulated active time of all interfaces. We run the simulation
100 times.
As shown in Fig. 4, an indoor overlay WLAN topol-
ogy was used to evaluate the performance of different hand-
off algorithms. We use four adjacent cells with 100-meter
radius. The BSs are located in the same floor with the
following coordinates: (100, 240) , (100, 100) , (240, 100)
and (240, 240). The parameters of WLAN are pre-
sented in Table 1. To evaluate MRSS, we use the Ran-
dom Waypoint model to simulate a MN’s moving tra-
jectory. The trajectory is generated by the BonnMotion
node-movement generation tool [22]. All the trajectory
are straight lines that start from points in the square area
{(0, 0) , (340, 0) , (0, 340) , (340, 340)}. Table 2 shows the
setting of mobility model. The parameters of various ap-
proaches and thresholds are presented in Table 3. The k
value for NDMD [12] is used to calculate a smoothing fac-

 Abstract—This paper presents a novel ring-based approach to 
analyze the inter-flow capacity of a backhaul wireless mesh 
networks (WMNs) with centralized scheduling. Based on the 
property of symmetric MAC protocols, an optimistic channel 
reuse distance is defined, which enables us to accurately describe a 
bottleneck collision area for a mesh network. Then, the upper 
bound of inter-flow capacity is derived by calculating the 
maximum traffic load in the bottleneck collision area of a 
ring-based network model. Although the derived closed-form 
expression of the capacity upper bound is O(W/n) as specified in 
previous work, our results shows that it is also a function of the 
ratio between transmission range and network radius. We apply a 
previously presented algorithm [4] to estimate the real capacity of 
any given topology and compare with our analytical results. 
Through simulations and numerical analysis, it is shown that the 
proposed analysis can accurately estimate the inter-flow capacity.

I. INTRODUCTION
S various wireless networks evolve, wireless mesh 
networks (WMNs) have emerged recently as a key 
technology to provide better wireless broadband access 
[1]. In WMNs, nodes comprise subscriber stations (SSs), base 
stations (BSs) and mesh clients. SSs and BSs form the backbone 
of WMNs. Mesh clients can be a mobile host or a different 
wireless network, such as Wi-Fi or cellular networks. The 
traffic pattern in WMNs consists of intra-flow and inter-flow, 
where intra-flow is the flow with the source SS and the 
destination SS locating in the same WMN and inter-flow is the 
flow that goes to or comes from the Internet. An inter-flow 
passes through a BS, while an intra-flow does not. 
Internet access is the major service on a backhaul WMN. 
While a WMN can use some decentralized scheduling for 
packet transmission as in Ad Hoc wireless networks, the 
centralized scheduling scheme is preferred since all SS nodes 
are fixed and most traffic must go through the BS. Thus it is 
more efficient to let the BS node arrange inter-flow traffic 
transmission for every SS node. For example, in WiMAX, a BS 
can apply a centralized scheme to assign time slots for every SS 
in its Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme. 
When deploying a backhaul WMN with centralized control, 
it is important to estimate its capacity upper bound for 
inter-flow traffic. Although many studies have worked on 
capacity analysis in the past, they either focus on Ad Hoc 
wireless networks [2][3] or just present algorithms [4-6] to 
estimate network capacity. Thus, they are either in-applicable or 
cannot be readily used in planning a WMN.  
This paper developed a novel method to derive a closed form 
solution for the upper bound of inter-flow capacity for a WMN 
with centralized control. In our scheme, a ring-based network 
model [12] is applied to analyze the bottleneck of a WMN. 
Based on the property of symmetric MAC and interference 
model, a minimum channel reuse distance is defined and a 
bottleneck collision area (BCA) is recognized. Then, the upper 
bound of inter-flow traffic of a WMN is obtained by calculating 
the maximum traffic load in the BCA of a ring-based network 
model. Although, this work only present the results with 
uniform traffic and with single-channel and single-radio 
(SC-SR) interface, the results can be readily extended to 
non-uniform traffic and multi-channel and multi-radio 
(MC-MR) environment. 
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II 
briefly describes related research. In Section III, we set up the 
system model for this paper. We show the analytical analysis 
and simulation results in Section IV. Finally, Section V gives 
conclusion and future work.

B. Ring-based Mathematical Analysis 
We define a WMN as a multi-ring network, shown in Fig. 1, 
with a BS at the center of the rings. A k-hop node is a SS that is 
k-hop away from the BS, and a 1-hop node is a SS that is 
connected to the BS directly. The area of k-hop node is named 
ring k. A k-hop link is an inter-flow link between a k-hop node 
and a (k-1) hop node, where 0-hop node is defined as BS. The 
traffic of k-hop links Tk-hop is the number of flows relayed by 
k-hop links. 
The collision domain limits the capacity of a WMN. In order 
to find this limitation, [7] defines a bottleneck collision domain 
(BCD) as a bottleneck in a WMN. However, BCD is too 
pessimistic because, for WMNs with centralized control, in 
some situation, two links in a BCD are allowed to transmit 
simultaneously. In order to obtain the tighter capacity bound in 
such WMNs, we define a collision area as follows: 
Definition 2
A collision area (CA) is defined as an area in which no any 
two links can transmit simultaneously without being interfered 
with each other according to the symmetric MAC.     
To determine CA, we must know the minimum reuse 
distance, over which two links may transmit simultaneously 
without interfering each other.  
Definition 3
The distance between two links lA,B and lC,D is the 
maximum distance between their terminal nodes, i.e. 
(lA,B, lC,D) = max{ d(A, C), d(A, D), d(B, C), d(B, D) } 
where d(X, Y) is the distance between node X and node Y. 
 For example, in Fig. 2(a), (lA,B, lC,D) = d(A, D), and in Fig. 
2(b), (lA,B, lC,D) = d(B, D). 
Definition 4
The minimum reuse distance dreuse(lA,B, lC,D) is the minimum 
distance between links lA,B and lC,D such that the two links can 
transmit simultaneously without interfering each other.    
Lemma 1
With the symmetric MAC scheme, the minimum reuse 
distance dreuse of two p-links when they are located on a line is 
2reused p f= + (4)
If two p-links are not located on a line, then 
2reused p f< + (5)
                             
Proof 
 If  lA,B and lC,D are p-links, then d(A, B) = d(C, D) = p. As 
shown in Fig. 2(a), lA,B and lC,D  are located on a line. Links lA,B
and lC,D can transmit simulataneously only when d(B, C) > f , 
where d(B, C) is the shortest distance between the two links. 
Thus  
(lA,B, lC,D) = d(A, D)
= d(A, B) + d(B, C) + d(C, D)
> 2p + f.
Thus dreuse(lA,B, lC,D) = 2p + f
 As shown in Fig. 2(b), lA,B and lC,D  are not located on a line. 
Links lA,B and lC,D can transmit simulataneously only when d(B,
C) > f , where d(B, C) is the shortest distance between the two 
links. Thus  
(lA,B, lC,D) = d(B, D)
> d(C, D) + d(B, C)   [triangle inequality] 
> p + f.

Because any two links in a BCA cannot use the same timeslots, 
the period of a scheduling is lower bounded by:

Note that the condition

ensures that the network is connected and the transmission 
range p is not larger than the radius of networks d.
In Theorem 2, the constants c1 and c2 are only affected by the

For MC-MR WMNs with c non-overlapping channels and m
radios for a node, where 1 m c≤ ≤ , through a proper channel 
assignment, the maximum number of radios that can 
simultaneously transmit or receive is c, thus the maximum 
capacity per-node is simply c η× and the maximum network 
capacity is n c η× × .
C. Numerical Results 
All diagrams in this section assume that the interference 
range is 1.5 times than the transmission range, i.e. 0.5Δ = , and 
100 SSs. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 show per-node capacity with the 
relationship between the transmission range and the radius of 
networks using the symmetric MAC. In Fig. 3, it can be 
observed that increasing the transmission range with a large 
network gains larger capacity than that with a smaller network. 
The phenomenon is similar, but the rate of change is smaller. 
Assume 0.5Δ =  and d =1 km. Fig. 4 shows that the number 
of SSs is independent of the total capacity, and larger 
transmission range leads to higher capacity. 
D. Simulation Results 
To validate our analytical solution, we compare the 
inter-flow capacity derived by the algorithm presented in [4] 
and BCD [7] against our analytical results. Fig. 5 shows that the 
per-node capacity obtained by the analytic analysis is much 
larger than the estimated capacity by BCD. BCD substantially 
underestimates the inter-flow capacity when the transmission 
range is small, but improves in estimation accuracy when the 
transmission range increases. On the other hand, the algorithm 
presented in [4] achieves almost the same capacity estimation as 
that of our analytical analysis. When the transmission range is 
equal to the radius of networks, all three approaches reach the 
maximum capacity /W n .
