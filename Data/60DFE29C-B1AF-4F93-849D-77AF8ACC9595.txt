humidity. The research goal is to produce a high 
sensitive and rapid ppb-level ammonia gas sensor. 
 
Recently, quantum neural network (QNN) has 
been used to deal with the signals with fuzziness since 
its hidden units having various graded levels which are 
capable of classifying the features of signals [14-18]. It 
is well known that the conventional FNN model only 
can learn a very close approximation to the crisp 
information provided by the training data. It is unable to 
effectively deal with the data with fuzziness or 
uncertainty. On the contrary, QNN model has the ability 
to create the graded partitions for the fuzziness in the 
training data [15]. In our studies, we use QNN in the 
application on identification of ammonia concentration 
in humid environment. To demonstrate the superiority of 
QNN over FNN, the identified results performed by 
these two methods are reported as a comparison.  
 
2. QNN Model and Learning Algorithm 
 
In this research, a size of 2-16-1 QNN and 
conventional FNN models were used for all experiments. 
The basic diagram of NN structure is shown in Figure 1. 
It is a feedforward fully connected scheme. The single 
level sigmoid function is taken as the activation function 
for all nodes in hidden layer and output layer of FNN. 
Its math form is expressed as ))exp(1/(1)( xxsgm −+= . 
The ns-level sigmoid function is taken as the activation 
function by the units in hidden layer of QNN. Its math 
form is expressed as  
( ) ∑

)))(exp(1/(1)/1( θ  
where ns is the number of levels and rθ is the jump 
positions in the activation function. In the output layer, 
we still use the one level sigmoid function as the node’s 
activation function. The major steps of QNN learning 
algorithm is summarized and presented as follows [15]. 
 
2.1  Update the synaptic weights 
 
Let )]( ..., ),( ),([)( 21 kskskskS p=  and )]( ..., ),( ),([)( 21 kokokokO p=  
be the desired output vector and actual output vector of 
the network on presentation of pattern k, where p is the 
number of nodes in the output layer. Let )(kYj  be the 
output value of hidden node j and )(kZi  be the value of 
input signal from ith node in the layer below node j. If j 
is an output node then )(kZi = )(kYi . If j is a hidden 
node then )(kZi = )(kXi , the i
th node’s value of the input 
layer. Denote )(kjδ  as the error term of node j. 
Thus, if j is an output node, then

In our studies, 5.0=η , 0=ζ  and ns=10. 
 
2.2  Update the quantum intervals 
 
The quantum intervals can be updated by 
minimizing the class-conditional variances at the outputs 
of hidden units [15]. In each training epoch, we calculate 
the following outputs for each hidden node j.

3. Experiments 
 
3.1  Fabrication of SH-SAW devices 
 
The SH-SAW sensor designed as a two-port 
resonator was fabricated on a 36oYX-LiTaO3 substrate 
by a lift-off method, using aluminum 120 nm 
metallization. The number of fingers of a pair of 
interdigital transducers (IDTs) was 29, the width of IDT 
was 7 µm, the aperture was 750 µm, the length of the 
short-circuit reflector was 1400 µm, the metallization 
ratio was 0.5, and the length of the cavity was 1148 µm. 
The operating frequency of the resonator was 148 MHz. 
model is suitable in this application. The inputs of the 
neural model were the humidity and the frequency shift, 
and the output was the concentration of ammonia. For 
demonstrating the feasibility of NN used, four different 
data sets were randomly organized. For each data set, 81 
points were used for NN’s training and 9 points were 
used for testing. Table 1 and Table 2 list the test errors 
for four data sets, respectively. The mean absolute error 
(MAE) over all test data is used as the measurement of 
performance. We can clearly find that the total average 
errors between the identified concentrations of ammonia 
and the actual ones for these two NN models are 4.189 
ppb and 10.686 ppb. Obviously, the identification results 
performed by QNN model are much better than FNN 
model.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this research, a high sensitive and rapid ppb-level 
SH-SAW ammonia gas sensor was successfully produced. 
The humidity interference on the SH-SAW ammonia 
sensors was also studied. The frequency shift to 200 ppb 
ammonia was 1.6 ppm and that to 320 ppb ammonia was 
2.1 ppm. The response time was in seconds of exposure to 
ppb-level ammonia. The SH-SAW sensor showed the 
negative frequency shift and mass loading primarily 
dominated the perturbation in dry nitrogen. However, in 
humid environment, the frequency shift of the sensor had 
positive responses and the contribution of the elastic effect 
was significant. Two NN models were used as the 
identifiers to estimate the ammonia in humid air. From the 
performance results shown, QNN model we proposed 
indeed can effectively perform the identification of 
ammonia in a common ambience and overcome the 
inference of humidity caused. It promotes such a sensor 
with QNN technique in the practical applications.
