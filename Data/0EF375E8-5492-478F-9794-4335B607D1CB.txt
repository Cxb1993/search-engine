nonlinear static titration curve [6,7]. Moreover, it 
has been found that Hammerstein or Wiener 
models may account for nonlinear effects 
encountered in many chemical and industrial 
processes, such as exothermic chemical reactors, 
high-purity distillation columns, furnaces, and 
heat exchangers [8–10]. Boyd and Chua [11] 
have proven that any time-invariant process with 
fading memory can be approximated by a 
Volterra series representation which in turn can 
be realized by a Wiener model with polynomial 
static nonlinearity. 
Simultaneous parametric identification of 
the nonlinear and linear elements for 
Hammerstein and Wiener systems has the 
advantages of implementation easiness and 
efficient utilization of the test data. However, it 
suffers from the situation that the internal 
variable between the nonlinear and linear parts is 
inaccessible to measurements. As a result, the 
regression equation may not be 
linear-in-parameters and the conventional 
least-squares algorithm is not easily applicable. 
This problem could be circumvented by an 
iteration procedure with the internal variable 
updated at each iteration step. The major 
difficulty is that the convergence of parameter 
estimates to the actual values is not always 
warranted due to the coupling between the 
nonlinear static and linear dynamic parts. The 
convergence properties are affected by the 
assumed form of static nonlinearity, degree of 
nonlinearity, selection of the exciting input, 
initial guess of the internal variable, linear 
structure mismatch, and measurement noise. 
Voros [12–14] developed several iterative 
methods to identify discrete Hammerstein and 
Wiener models, where the static nonlinearity is 
approximated by a two-segment polynomial or a 
multi-segment piecewise linear function. Using 
the decomposition technique, the regression 
equation can be made linear-in-parameters for 
iterative estimation. Voros’s methods will be 
faced with a serious convergence problem when 
the structure of the linear element is incorrectly 
selected, the static nonlinearity cannot be 
described well by the assumed nonlinear function, 
or the measured output is corrupted by severe 
noise. 
In this project, an iterative method is 
presented to identify a continuous-time 
single-input/single-output (SISO) Hammerstein 
or Wiener model by approximating the static 
nonlinearity by an appropriate function and 
providing effective formulae for updating the 
internal variable. A two-stage estimation 
algorithm, incorporating moving-horizon 
smoothing and a solution-guiding mechanism, is 
developed to ensure the convergence and 
accuracy of the iterative method in the face of 
linear structure mismatch, high static 
nonlinearity with an unknown characteristic, and 
severe noise. The first stage of the algorithm 
arrives at a good description of static nonlinearity 
by virtue of a multi-segment function or a 
polynomial in an iterative manner. The second 
stage of the algorithm reduces the identification 
problem to a simple linear one with the internal 
variable acquired previously. A non-iterative 
procedure can then be applied to determine the 
structure and parameters of the linear dynamic 
element.  
2. Nonlinear SISO System Description 
Here, we consider the identification of 
continuous-time Wiener models as depicted in 
Figure 1. The input and output variables, u(t) and 
y(t), are measurable. However, the intermediate 
signal x(t) between the linear dynamic block and 
the nonlinear static block, called the internal 
variable, is inaccessible to measurements.

linear-in-parameters if x(t) is updated at each 
iteration step. 
3. Time-Weighted Integral Transform 
To deal with the time derivatives in the 
foregoing regression equations, which are never 
available in practice, we extend the 
time-weighted integral transform proposed by 
Hwang and Lin2 for linear systems to nonlinear 
Hammerstein and Wiener systems. They defined 
an lth-order integral transform to convert a 
continuous-time signal f(t) over a time interval [ta,

the zeroth-order transform for the i-th derivative 
of the signal, f (i) (t) , can be derived as

Using eq 11 with f(t) replaced by y(t), x(t), u(t), or

4. Iterative Identification Method with a 
Two-Stage Estimation Algorithm 
In this section, an iterative identification 
method for Wiener models is developed based on 
the regression equation (eq 12) derived according 
to the approximations by the multi-segment 
functions. If a polynomial function is preferred 
(e.g., the static nonlinearity is not invertible for 
Wiener identification), the corresponding 
regression equation can be derived by taking the 
zeroth-order transform on eq 4. It will be shown, 
however, that the use of the multi-segment 
functions is more reliable for the sake of 
convergence and accuracy subject to higher static 
nonlinearity. 
4.1. Moving-Horizon Least-Squares Estimator 
Note that eq 12 is dependent upon two 
arguments, ta and tb. Therefore, insofar as 
sufficient data of u(t), x(t), and y(t) are available, 
one can generate a preferred number of linear 
regression relations by choosing different sets of 
time intervals (or moving horizons) for the 
integral transform. For instance, the k-th 
regression relation can be created by performing 
the integration over a time horizon between ta(k) 
and tb(k). The following formulae are 
recommended to produce N regression relations 
for subsequent least-squares estimation: 
( )0( ) 1 , ( ) ( ) ,
1, 2, ,
a b at k t k t k t k
k N
λ η η= + − = +
= L  (13) 
where t0 and tf  (= ta(N)+ η) denote, respectively, 
the initial time and final time for data acquisition. 
Each time horizon starts from a different ta(k) and 
has the same horizon length η. The least-squares 
estimator for the Wiener model, θ ˆw , can be 
calculated as

structure mismatch, high or peculiar static 
nonlinearity, and severe noise. By linear structure 
mismatch, we mean that the assumed orders and 
delay of the linear dynamic part, i.e., n, m, and d, 
may be incorrect. Because the correct linear 
structure is usually unknown a priori, this 
mechanism is practically helpful to the accurate 
approximation of the static nonlinearity. 
In the present identification framework for a 
Wiener model, the convergence problem is rather 
stringent and the smoothing mechanism with a 
higher η does not suffice to ensure the 
convergence of the estimator to the actual values. 
Such a situation is often encountered when the 
range of test data is wide so that the static 
nonlinearity becomes high. A plausible reason is 
that the internal variable x(t) may vary widely 
with the iterative estimation of the linear 
dynamic part, thus strengthening the coupling 
between the nonlinear and linear parts especially 
in the presence of linear structure mismatch. An 
extra mechanism based on the hybrid x(t) 
estimate of eq 16 was recommended previously 
to guide the iteration procedure toward the 
accurate solution that enhances the consistency 
of the two x(t) estimates. With the smoothing and 
solution-guiding mechanisms, the iteration 
procedure for the Wiener model would also 
guarantee the convergence of the least-squares 
estimator as well as the estimation accuracy of 
the static nonlinearity. 
4.4. Two-Stage Estimation Algorithm 
As mentioned previously, a larger η would 
render the approximation of the nonlinear static 
element more accurate despite linear structure 
mismatch. This implies that the converged 
estimate of the internal variable x(t) is also 
reliable. Conversely, the estimation accuracy of 
the linear dynamic element is somewhat 
sacrificed because much of high frequency 
information (small time scale) about test data has 
been lost. Some remedy should be applied to 
recover the estimation accuracy of the linear 
dynamic part. 
Another problem is that the iteration 
procedure requires knowing the partition points a 
priori (an optimization technique is needed if 
they are unknown). Although they are usually 
unknown in practice, a rough estimate of the 
partition points can be inferred from the range of 
test data. We then recommend a two-stage 
estimation algorithm as follows: 
Stage 1. Given the partition points (y1, y-1), 
apply the iteration procedure with a sufficiently 
large η to test data. The linear structure (n, m, d) 
can be quite arbitrarily assumed at this stage and 
hence it might be incorrect. To ensure 
convergence and accuracy, it is suggested to set 
the η value larger than the process settling time. 
If the settling time is unknown, one can try 
different (from small to large) values of η until 
rather consistent solutions become obtainable. 
The previous analysis implies that insofar as the 
selected partition points are appropriate, the 
identified nonlinear static part and the associated 
estimate of the internal variable x(t) can be 
deemed reliable. 
Stage 2. Determine the accurate linear 
structure and estimate the model parameters of 
the linear dynamic part based on x(t) gained at 
Stage 1. Note that with the reliable estimation of 
the internal variable, the identification problem 
can be reduced to a simple linear one, for which a 
non-iterative procedure is able to arrive at more 
accurate parameter estimates for the linear 
dynamic part. The method of Hwang and Lin2 for 
linear systems can be modified in a trivial way to 
deal with the resulting linear identification 
problem. This method includes determination of 
the linear model structure and estimation of the 
associated model parameters. For the Wiener 
model, we consider eq 1 with b0 estimated at 
Stage 1, for which x(t) is replaced by x ˆnl(t)  
calculated according to eq 15b. Because x ˆlin(t)  
calculated by eq 15a contains no new information 
about the linear dynamic element, it is not needed 
in the linear identification problem at this stage. 
To facilitate the estimation accuracy of the linear 
dynamic element, a smaller η value should be 
used. We suggest setting the η value equal to the 
settling time. Here, a good estimate of the settling 
time is obtainable from the linear dynamic 
element given at Stage 1.

experimental real example have been employed

the heat exchanger example obtained from

approximates closely the theoretical value of 
1 2 3( ) 88.49Ah q q q+ + = . Such an agreement 
justifies that the pH process is indeed of Wiener 
type. 
Note that it is not possible to describe 
perfectly the actual titration curve by the 
proposed four-segment function. However, our 
algorithm allows the linear dynamic part to be 
identified pretty well at the second stage insofar 
as the major trend of the static nonlinearity can be 
captured. The identified linear part given above 
could arrive at a fairly good estimate of the 
internal variable, x ˆlin(t) . As a result, in the plot of 
( ) pHy t +  versus ( ) 0 3ˆˆlinx t b q+ , numerous data 
points can be observed to fluctuate around the 
actual titration curve as evidenced in the subplot 
of Figure 3a. We then propose a simple data 
smoothing technique to provide a perfect fit to 
the titration curve as follows. First divide the 
observed data points into a number of 
neighboring clusters. Next determine each 
smoothed data point by averaging the original 
data points contained within each cluster. Figure 
3a verifies that the titration curve can indeed be 
constructed perfectly by the smoothed data 
points. 
Example 2 
In addition to the preceding simulated 
example, we apply the proposed method to the 
experimental data of a real steam-water heat 
exchanger acquired by Eskinat et al. [16]. In their 
experimental setup, the steam condensed in a 
two-pass shell and tube heat exchanger, thereby 
raising the process water temperature. The steam 
flow rate and process water flow rate were 
controlled by pneumatic control valves. A PRBS 
identification test with a switching time of 1 
minute was performed on the heat exchanger in 
closed-loop operation. The water flow rate was 
changed by varying the setpoint of the controller, 
keeping the steam flow constant. The 
measurements of the process water exit 
temperature were fed to a data acquisition system 
with a sampling time of 12 seconds. The 
experimental input-output data are plotted in 
Figure 4, where the deviation variables u and y 
denote, respectively, changes in the water flow 
rate and changes in the water exit temperature. 
They also provided steady-state operation data as 
shown in Figure 5a. 
The two-stage algorithm, assuming η = 144, 
n = 2, m = 1, and d = 0 for the first stage, can 
identify the process as a Wiener model with a 
polynomial of degree 2 based on the training 
input-output data during the period of 0 ≤ t ≤ 
3000 seconds. The rest of the data is used to test 
the validity of the identified model. It should be 
mentioned that the selected η  value was obtained 
by trying different values for η until rather 
consistent solutions appeared. The Wiener model
