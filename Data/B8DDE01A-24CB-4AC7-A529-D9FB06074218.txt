 Abstract 
With progress of technology, cellular phones have to provide image and video transmission 
except traditional voice transmission. However, image and video transmission would test 
sharing the same wireless channels with more information. Therefore, efficient use of radio 
resource would be a serious topic. There are many ways to solve this problem. Here, we focus 
on power control to improve the system efficiency. First, information transmissions in 
wireless channels suffer from Raleigh fading and interference. Power control is needed to 
compensate for these effects. Second, interference to the other users will be reduced and the 
system capacity will be increased with the power control schemes. This project describes a 
proposed predictive inverse fast power control in WCDMA systems. Replacing the 
conventional power control schemes, this power control scheme controls the mobile’s 
transmitted power based on the prediction of the fading channel attenuation. In the simulation, 
the performance of our proposed power control scheme is better than those of the 
conventional ones at medium or high speed. Furthermore, this power control scheme can 
transmit less power to maintain the SIR around the target SIR. With less power transmitted, 
the interference to other users would be reduced. According to previous research, we digitize 
the transmitted power to make the PI-PCA more practical and operational to see if the 
performance of this power control scheme would be better than the traditional ones.

III. Analysis of CLPC 
 
In previous algorithms [13-15], the power control 
error (PCE) is affected by the variation of the fading 
channel and the variation of the interference.  The 
goal of CLPC is to maintain the measured SIR close 
to the target SIR and we propose a new method to 
minimize the PCE accordingly.  By representing the 
received SIR in terms of the transmitted power, we 
obtain the error in dB as

If we adjust the next transmission power ( 1)tP n +  
only by error ( )e n , the next received power at the 
BS is ( 1) ( 1)tP n nφ+ + + .  If the next channel power 
gain ( 1)n+φ  can be predicted, we adjust the 
( 1)tP n +  by a value ˆ[ ( ) ( ) ( 1)]e n n n+ − +φ φ , where 
ˆ( 1)n+φ  is the predicted value of the next channel 
power gain.  Furthermore, the received power at the 
BS will be

and the measured SIR will be

Then, we can derive the general formula of PCE as

ˆ[ ( 1) ( 1)] [ ( 1) ( )]

φ n φ n I n I n
+ = −
= + − + + + −   (10) 
In (10), if the predicted value ˆ( 1)n+φ  is close to 
( 1)n+φ , the first term of PCE will almost be equal 
to zero.  Thus, the error will be reduced.  To do so, 
we apply the method proposed in subsection II-A.  It 
is based on the previous channel gain at the BS.  We 
assume that the BS knows the transmission power 
( )tP t  of the MS at each time instant.  This 
assumption is reasonable since the BS can usually 
recover ( )tP t  from the information sent from the 
MS.  Therefore, we can get the channel power gain 
( )nφ in dB as 
( ) ( ) ( )r tn P n P nφ = −                   (11) 
and the signal ( )nφ is fed into the predictor in Fig.2.  
The predictor will record the (M-1) previous samples 
and current sample [ ( ), ( 1),..., ( 1)]n n n M− − +φ φ φ , 
and predict the future channel power attenuation 
( 1)n+φ one step ahead.  Fig.4 shows an attenuation 
curve ( )nφ  resulting from a Rayleigh fading channel 
together with its predicted value ˆ( )nφ .

-13.3 dB.  The velocity of the MS is selected from 
the range between 3 and 120 km/h, and is changed 
during simulation.  The simulation time is six 
seconds.  In other words, there are totally 9,000 slots 
in our simulation duration.  The radio gain is only 
modeled as motion induced Rayleigh distributed 
multi-path fading generated by Jake’s model 
described in subsection II-C.  Our simulation 
parameters are summarized in Table 1.  At this 
speed the maximum Doppler frequency mf is 6Hz.  
We simulate the channel conditions from the speed 
3km/h to 120km/h. 
Here, we analyze the results in PCE.  The standard 
deviation of PCE ( )e n  is used as a measure of how 
well the power control algorithms achieve the target 
SIR.  In the following, we divide simulations into 
two parts, where the interference is zero mean with 
variances 1, so that the effect of the variance of the 
interference can be observed. 
According to those power control schemes, we 
simulate two of them to show how the algorithms 
work. Fist, the result of 3-bit command PCA1 at the 
speed of 3km/hrs is presented in Fig.7. Then, Fig.8 
shows the result of the proposed power control 
algorithm at the same speed.

From (7), PCE is the difference between the target 
SIR and the realistic SIR at each slot.  If PCE is 
negative, it means that the realistic SIR overtakes the 
target SIR, and the communication quality is good.  
However, in this condition, the user transmits 
excessive power to other users.  If PCE is positive, it 
means that the target SIR overtakes the realistic SIR, 
and the communication quality is poor.  This is not 
desired, either.  The best condition is that the 
received SIR just equals the target SIR, so that the 
communication quality would be good and the 
interference to other users would be reduced.  
According to these results shown above, we observe 
the characteristics of the power control algorithms in 
this paper.  At low speed, the performances of the 
conventional power control algorithms, such as 3-bit 
PCA1 and 3GPP PCA1, are better than those of 4-bit 
PI-PCA and 5-bit PI-PCA.  But at medium or high 
speeds, the performances of 4-bit PI-PCA and 5-bit 
PI-PCA are better than those of 3-bit PCA1 and 3GPP

increase of mobile speed. That is because the 
variance of channel fading increases with the increase 
of mobile speed. The simulation of different power 
control schemes shows that the conventional PCAs 
perform better at low speed while our proposed 
PI-PCAs perform better at median or high speed. To 
say specifically, the performance of 4-bit PI-PCA or 
5-bit PI-PCA is worse than the conventional PCAs at 
low speed but better at median or high speeds. 
Besides, we can find that more bits in power control 
command would improve the performance of PI-PCA, 
which also becomes a cost in the algorithm. Here, the 
5-bit PI-PCA is an ideal case and 4-bit may be more 
practical in reality.   
To make a high performance of power control 
scheme, we may combine the PI-PCA with 
conventional PCAs. With the conventional PCAs 
taken at low speed, the PI-PCA is utilized at high 
speed.  
According to the PCE, we observe that our PI-PCA 
can maintain the measured SIR around the target SIR 
with less transmitted power. Since the power control 
scheme could transmit less power, it is expected that 
the interference to other users will be reduced and the 
battery life of mobile will be extended. It also means 
the increase of the system capacity. In 
communication system, the power control scheme is 
the basis of the radio resource management such as 
load control and admission control, etc. In our 
simulation, we just consider a simple model to 
experiment on these power control algorithms. In the 
future, we may take the path loss due to distance 
between the base station and mobile users, 
shawdowing effect, other interference from users in 
other cells, and the loop delays into our simulation.
