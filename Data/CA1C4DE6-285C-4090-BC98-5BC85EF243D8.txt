ㄧ、報告內容 
(一) 前言 (Introduction) 
   Articular cartilage is a tough, resilient connective tissue that is well suited for a variety of mechanical 
roles. The mechanical property of cartilage is attributed to the abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) mainly 
consisting of fine collagen fibrils and high concentration of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and proteoglycans. 
The architecture of articular cartilage is virtually not homogenous. In the cross-section of every articular 
cartilage at least four different depth zones; superficial, transitional, middle and calcified zones, can be 
defined varying in their biochemical composition, the structure of the matrix components and even the 
number and shape of the embedded chondrocytes. The composition of the matrix is determined by the 
balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix components, and is dependent upon the activity of 
chondrocytes, the only cell species existing in articular cartilage. 
Articular cartilage has little or no capacity for effective repair following traumatic injury. Tissue 
engineering opens a new horizon to potentially provide cartilaginous constructs capable of restoring the 
normal function of native cartilage following joint injury, or degeneration. One approach to functional tissue 
engineering of articular cartilage involves the in vitro cultivation of tissue constructs using chondrogenic cells, 
scaffolds, and bioreactors. Successful tissue engineering substantially relies on a controllable manner to 
culture tissue in terms of its structure. Tissue engineering using traditional methodology, by which cells are 
seeded into 3-D scaffold, normally results in an in-homogenous or uncontrollable neo-tissue. This outcome 
may be attributable to un-uniform cell seeding, mass transfer limitation or other physical or biochemical 
conditions. Apart from that, it will also be a challenge to generate differential structure properties in one 3-D 
cultured construct because the traditional way of tissue culture generally treats the engineered tissue as an 
“intact construct” and the relevant techniques developed are usually from the “bulk” point of view. From 
engineering standpoint, this research project would like to address an issue about the “structurally-controllable 
cartilage tissue engineering” 
In the hope of producing a tissue construct with structurally controllable property, the concept of 
exploiting cell-entrapped micro-engineered hydrogel particles as building blocks to assemble a 3-D culture 
construct for in vitro cartilage tissue culture (or called bottom-up tissue engineering) is proposed in this study. 
One can vision that, apart from using this approach for in vitro structurally controllable cartilage tissue 
engineering, the ultimate hope beyond this strategy is to use the cell (and/or growth factors)-entrapped 
micro-engineered hydrogel particles to fill up the defect size of articular cartilage injury instead of implanting 
an intact in vitro engineered cartilage tissue, which may avoid the highly invasive surgical procedure and the 
resulting long rehabilitation process. This is of great importance for the medical treatment of cartilage injury.

RESEARCH  PAPER  
Abstract Recently, microbead generation and microen-
capsulation of cells using microfluidic technology have been 
actively pursued for various applications. However, most of 
the proposed systems are not only technically demanding, 
but  might  also  be  harmful  to  the  encapsulated 
cells.  To tackle these issues, this study reports a
microfluidic alginate microbead generator consisting of a
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chip and an
integrated quartz micro- capillary tube. The working
principle is based on the use of a pulsed airflow to segment a
continuous alginate suspension flow to form suspension
fragments in a microchannel and then alginate microbeads
when they were delivered out the microfluidic  system  to 
a  sterile  calcium  chloride  solution through  a 
microcapillary  tube.  In  this  study,  the  alginate 
suspension fragments with varied sizes in the microchannel 
can be generated either by modulating the alginate suspen-
sion flow rate or the pulsation frequency of airflow injection. 
By fine tuning the size of them, the alginate microbeads can 
Microencapsulation is the technology of enclosing a sub-
stance inside a continuous membrane or matrix to form a 
microbead. Microencapsulation technology has long history 
of exploitation in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, biotech-
nological, and biomedical industries to encapsulate, for 
example, food flavors, drugs, cosmetics,  microorganisms, 
and animal cells, respectively. Among these applications, 
cell microencapsulation technology is based on the immo-
bilization of cells within a semipermeable material. The 
encapsulating material protects the trapped cells from both 
mechanical stress and the host’s immune system while 
allowing the bidirectional diffusion of nutrients, oxygen, 
and waste (Murua et al. 2008). Cell microencapsulation is 
widely used in biomedical area for continuous synthesis of 
therapeutic products to host by immuno-isolated cells to 
treat diseases (Elliott et al. 2005; Emerich et al. 2006), and 
for tissue repair (Chung et al. 2006; Kaigler et al. 2006). The

systems make use of two immiscible fluids [e.g., oil
(Liu et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2007; Yang 
et al. 2007; Koster et al. 2008; Clausell-Tormos et al. 2008) 
or organic solvent (Choi et al. 2007; Xu et al. 2008)] to 
sandwich an aqueous stream containing the encapsulated 
substances in a microchannel. Then, the microdroplets (e.g., 
water-in-oil emulsions) were formed in the oil or organic 
phase through the designs of microchannel with specific 
geometry (Huang et al. 2007) or of mechanical disturbing 
(Lin et al. 2007). The microdroplets formed in such pro-
cesses were subsequently delivered to a container, where 
the gelation of microbeads occurred. Compared with the 
microbead generation using the principles of electrospray-
ing or airflow nozzle design as aforementioned, these 
microfluidic systems are easier to fabricate, mainly by the 
well-established polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) soft-
lithography technique (Lin et al. 2007; Choi et al. 2007). 
However, these designs involved the use of oil or organic 
phase, or mechanical force to generate water-in-oil emul-
sions (microdroplets) in the process, which may be harmful 
to the living cells or may cause contamination. For example, 
the use of organic solution or mechanical disturbance in such 
process may damage the delicate biological cells and thus 
may affect cell viability. Also, the exposure of gelled 
microbeads to oil or organic phase could lead to contami-
nation. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to these 
issues. 
In order to generate cell-contained microbeads in a 
simpler, continuous, controllable, uniform, cell friendly and
less contaminated manner, this study proposed a PDMS
microfluidic alginate microbead generator for the 
microencapsulation of cells. The working principle is based 
on the manipulation of a pulsed airflow injection to inter-
mittently segment a continuous alginate/cells suspension 
flow in order to fine-tune the size of the suspension frag-
ments in a microchannel. The multiple suspension frag-
ments generated in the microchannel are then delivered out 
of the system to a sterile calcium chloride solution through
a quartz microcapillary tube. This is where the formation of 
alginate microbeads takes place. In this study, the alginate 
suspension fragments with varied sizes in the microchannel 
can be created either by modulating the alginate suspension 
flow rate or the pulsation frequency of airflow injection. By 
regulating the size of alginate suspension fragments, the 
alginate microbeads can be produced in a size-controllable 
manner. Within the experimental conditions explored, the 
results demonstrated that the size of alginate microbead 
ranging from 150 to 370 μm in diameter can be generated 
with an excellent size uniformity (CV: 3.1–5.1%) at the 
alginate suspension flow rate and airflow injection fre-
quency ranges of 2–4 μl/min and 0.6–35 Hz, respectively. 
Besides, the utilization of the proposed device for the 
microencapsulation of chondrocytes in alginate microbeads
was also demonstrated showing a good cell viability of
96 ± 2%. Compared with the previous works, overall,
the presented work has demonstrated an alternative route 
to carry out microencapsulation of cells in alginate micro-
beads in a simple, continuous, controllable, uniform, and 
cell friendly manner. 
2 Materials and methods
2.1  
The photograph of the proposed PDMS microfluidic algi-
nate microbead generator is shown in Fig. 1a. It comprises a 
main microchannel (length (L): 25 mm, width (W): 150 μm, 
and height (H): 100 μm) for alginate/cells  suspension flow
and a T-shaped pneumatic microchannel with its one 
microchannel (L: 6 mm, W: 50 μm, and H: 100 μm) for 
constant pneumatic pressure input and another one (L: 3.5
mm, W: 50 μm, and H: 100 μm) for pulsed airflow 
injection. At the end of the main microchannel, one quartz 
microcapillary tube (OD: 375 μm and ID: 75 μm) was 
inserted to connect with the main microchannel for deliv-
ering alginate/cells suspension out of the microfluidic sys-
tem. To facilitate the connection work, a rectangular 
chamber (L: 2.5 mm, W: 380 μm, and H: 380 μm) at the 
end of main microchannel was designed to spatially fit the
inserted microcapillary tube. Besides, another end of the 
quartz microcapillary tube was etched to create a sharp tip 
(OD: 135 μm and ID: 75 μm). The assembly of the 
microfluidic alginate microbead generator chip is illustrated 
in Fig. 1b. Briefly, two PDMS plates with microfabricated 
microchannels (layer A) and rectangular chamber (layer B), 
respectively, were permanently bonded to form a micro-
fluidic system. This was followed by the insertion of the 
quartz microcapillary tube to the designed rectangular 
chamber. In this study, the mechanism of alginate 
microbead generation is illustrated in Fig. 2a, b. In the
upstream process (Fig. 2a), a constant pneumatic 
pressure was applied through one of the T-shaped
pneumatic microchannels to inhibit the inflow of
alginate/cells suspension flow to the T-shaped pneumatic
microchannels (Fig. 2a-I). In the meanwhile, a pulsed
airflow was injected through another pneumatic
microchannel to intermittently segment the continuous
alginate suspension (1% (w/v), viscosity: 190 cP at 25 ℃)
(unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased
from Sigma, Taiwan) flow so as to generate suspension
fragments in the main microchannel (Fig. 2a-II–IV). Either fine
tuning the suspension flow rate, or the pressure or
frequency of the pulsed airflow, the size of suspension 
fragments in the main microchannel can be modulated in a 
controllable manner. In the downstream process (Fig. 2b), 
the  multiple  suspension  fragments  generated  in  the

The conditions for post-exposure baking were 65 ℃ for

In the following replica molding process, PDMS was 
prepared by thoroughly mixing the PDMS pre-polymer with
a curing agent in a ratio of 10:1 by weight. The polymer was 
then deaerated under vacuum to remove the air bubbles 
created during mixing. Then the mixture was poured onto 
the two fabricated masters and cured at 100 ℃ for 1 h.
The cured PDMS plates were then obtained from a
de-molding process. The two PDMS plates (layers A and
from the replica molding were then bonded via plasma
oxidation treatment to form a microfluidic system. This is 
followed by the insertion of the microcapillary tube to the 
designed rectangular chamber. The photograph of the 
assembled microfluidic alginate microbead generator chip
is shown in Fig. 1a. In this study, the proposed microfluidic 
alginate microbead generator chip was placed vertically 
allowing the sharp tip of microcapillary tube to immerse in 
the thin oil layer perpendicularly as described in Fig. 2b. In 
the operation, the alginate/cells suspension flow was driven

based on the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, 50 μl of
the dye reagent containing 1 μM calcein AM and 2 μM

chondrocytes encapsulated in alginate microbeads. After 
10 min incubation, the images of live (green) and dead

fluorescence microscope. Cell viability was then estimated 
by counting the live (green) and dead (red) cells using a 
software program (SimplePCI version 5.2.1, Compix Inc.)

3  Results and 
3.1  Characteristics and design considerations
As discussed previously in the introduction section, several
microfluidic devices based on various mechanism have 
been actively pursued to perform the microencapsulation of 
cells because they can offer an automatic or continuous way
to generate cell-encapsulated microbeads with high 
uniformity (Choi et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2007). As a whole, 
cell microencapsulation based on these strategies is either 
technically demanding in terms of fabrication, assembly 
and operations, or involves the use of organic or oil phase 
fluids, which may hamper their widespread applications 
especially for the biomedical use. Borrowing from the idea 
of plug (or microdroplet) formation in microchannels as 
reported previously (Song et al. 2003; Gunther et al. 2004; 
Srinivasan et al. 2004), a microfluidic alginate  microbead 
generator was proposed in this study. The continuous plug 
formation in a microchannel refers to the use of a discon-
tinuous flow to segment a continuous flow to form multiple 
liquid or gas plugs in a microchannel. The techniques for 
plug or microdroplet formation in microchannels have been 
utilized for many applications such as rapid mixing (Song 
et al. 2003), synthesis of compounds (Gunther et al. 2004), 
or bioassays (Srinivasan et al. 2004), which have been well 
reviewed elsewhere (Christopher and Anna 2007; Teh et al. 
2008). The key  feature of the operation for plug/micro-
droplet formation in a microchannel is the precise control 
of liquid or gas plug volume. In addition, the devices are 
not only easy to design (mainly T-junction layout),
fabricate and assembly but it is also simple to operate.
Never- theless, most of proposed devices based on this
mechanism make use of oil phase fluid to create aqueous
microdroplets in it, which may cause problem as
aforementioned. 
To perform microencapsulation of living cells in a 
simpler, continuous, controllable, uniform, cell friendly and
less contaminated manner, a pulsed airflow injection was
used in  this study to intermittently segment a

possibly minimize the contamination caused by the oil or
organic phase. 
3.2  The size of alginate microbeads 
In the proposed mechanism for alginate microbead
generation, the size of resultant alginate microbeads is 
determined by the volume of the suspension fragments 
generated in the upstream process as described in Fig. 2a. 
In such process, the alginate suspension flow rate, and the 
pneumatic pressure or frequency of pulsed airflow injection 
are the three key technical parameters to modulate the size 
of suspension fragments. In this study, the pneumatic 
pressure of the injected airflow was set at the pressure 6.89
kPa higher than constant pneumatic pressure to ensure an
optimum performance in terms of operation stability and 
reproducibility based on our preliminary test as previously 
mentioned. In this work, the effect of alginate suspension 
flow rate and pulsation frequency of airflow injection on 
the  size of alginate microbeads was then experimentally 
estimated. As seen in Fig. 6a, at a given suspension flow 
rate, the size of suspension fragments partitioned by air 
segments can be controlled by the  pulsation  frequency
of airflow injection. In this evaluation, the lengths of  the 
suspension fragments formed under varied suspension flow 
rates (2–4 μl/min) and pulsation frequencies (0.6–35 Hz) of
airflow injection was measured. At a given microchannel 
dimensions, the volume of alginate suspension fragments 
and thus the diameter of the resultant alginate microbeads 
can be reasonably estimated. 
Not surprisingly, results (Fig. 6b) showed that at a con-
stant pulsation frequency of airflow injection, the estimated 
size of alginate microbeads increased with the increase of 
suspension flow rate. On the other hand, it  can be also 
observed from Fig. 6b that at a given suspension flow rate, 
the predicted size of alginate microbeads decreased with the 
increase of pulsation frequency of airflow injection. This is 
mainly due to the fact that the length of suspension frag-
ments formed at higher frequency range was shorter than 
that of the lower frequency counterpart. More interestingly,
it can be clearly noticed that when the frequency was higher 
than 12 Hz, the estimated size of alginate microbeads did 
not seem to be significantly changed. This might be caused 
by the lagging response of airflow injection to the high 
frequency. In the proposed system, the pulsation frequency 
of airflow injection is defined as the driving frequency of the 
EMV controlled by a custom-made circuit (Fig. 4). The 
lagging phenomenon mentioned here occurred when the 
movements of EMV are quicker than the formation process 
of alginate suspension fragment via the segmentation of the 
injected airflow as seen in Fig. 5a. The similar phenomena 
were also observed in some EMV-controlled pneumatic 
micropumps (Huang et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2008). In this

diameter of alginate microbead generated at varied alginate suspen-
sion flow rates and pulsation frequencies of airflow injection 
investigation, the minimum diameter of alginate micro-
beads that can be achieved was 150 μm at the suspension 
flow rate of 2 μl/min and the airflow injection frequency of
35 Hz (Fig. 6b). Due to the lagging phenomenon mentioned 
earlier, the size of alginate microbeads cannot be further 
reduced by the increase of airflow injection frequency. 
Alternatively, the decrease of suspension flow rate (e.g., 
lower than 2 μl/min) can in principle further downsize the 
alginate microbeads. However, this attempt is subjected to 
the adopted pumping scheme. In this study, a syringe pump 
was used to deliver suspension flow in the main micro-
channel. Our preliminary test found that at the pumping rate 
lower than 2 μl/min, the suspension flow cannot achieve a 
perfectly continuous flow pattern due to the limitation of 
syringe pump. This could in turn affect the uniformity of 
alginate microbeads generated. Unless a pumping method 
capable of providing a perfectly continuous flow is adopted, 
the lowest pumping rate of 2 μl/min used in this study is the 
best compromise between the achievable minimum size of 
alginate microbeads and the reasonable size uniformity of 
them. As a whole, within the experimental conditions 
explored, the size of alginate microbeads ranging from 150

process was also carried out (Fig. 8c). In this study, the cell
viability was estimated by counting the live (green) and 
dead (red) cells. Within the experimental conditions 
investigated, the calculated results showed that the cell 
viability for the chondrocytes encapsulated in alginate 
microbeads (Fig. 8b) was as high as 96 ± 2%, which has 
no statistical difference (p ＞ 0.05, Student’s t test) 
compared with that of the fresh chondrocytes isolated 
from cartilage tissue (Fig. 8c). Overall, the experimental
results revealed that the proposed device is not only able 
to achieve the alginate microbead generation in a simple, 
controllable and uniform manner, but it also offers a cell 
friendly way to microencapsulate living cells.
4  
The idea of plug/microdroplet formation in a microfluidic
system was utilized for the continuous generation of algi-
nate microbeads or for the microencapsulation of cells. In 
this study, the proposed microfluidic alginate microbead 
generator makes use of a pulsed airflow injection to 
intermittently segment the alginate suspension flow to form 
multiple alginate suspension fragments in the main 
microchannel and then alginate microbeads when they 
were  delivered out of the system to a sterile calcium 
chloride solution through a processed microcapillary tube. 
Compared with the previous plug/droplet-based microflu-
idic devices for the similar purpose, the presented design 
can possibly avoid the contamination caused by oil or other 
immiscible fluid in the process. Besides, the proposed 
device also features in the size-tunable generation of 
microbead by regulating the applied frequency of airflow 
injection or the suspension flow rate. Within the experi-
mental conditions explored, the results demonstrated that 
the size of alginate microbead ranging from 150 to 370 μm 
in diameter can be generated with an excellent size 
uniformity (CV: 3.1–5.1%) at the alginate suspension flow 
rate and airflow injection frequency ranges of 2–4 μl/min 
and 0.6–35 Hz, respectively. Furthermore, its application 
for the microencapsulation of chondrocytes in alginate 
microbeads was also demonstrated with high cell viability 
(96 ± 2%) showing no statistical difference with that
without going  through such process. As  a whole, the 
presented microfluidic alginate microbead generator has 
opened up an alternative route to perform the microen-
capsulation of cells in alginate microbeads in a simpler, 
continuous, controllable, uniform, cell friendly, and less 
contaminated manner.

Table I revealed the hysteresis voltages and drift rate of 
Sm2TiO5 EIS device annealed at various temperatures. The 
Sm2TiO5 EIS device without RTA treatment exhibited a higher 
hysteresis voltage than other RTA temperatures. This could be 
due to a large number of crystal defects in the Sm2TiO5. The 
Sm2TiO5 EIS capacitor performed at 900 °C exhibited the best 
long-term stability (slope=1.15 mV/h); in contrast, the EIS 
diode without PDA treatment featured a serious drift of 6.52 
mV/h. The lower drift effect after annealing at 900 °C resulted 
from the low density of crystal defects. We suspect that higher 
drift rates is due to a lower surface roughness and a larger 
number of crystal defects producing the presence of buried 
surface sites and/or traps. 
The measured as well as extracted sensing parameters are 
summarized in Table II, where the data from EIS devices 
fabricated a Si3N4 [9], Al2O3 [9], Ta2O5 [10], HfO2 [3], Y2O3 
[4], and Pr2O3 [5] film, are shown for comparison. Although a 
Sm2TiO5 sensing membrane has a slightly higher hysteresis 
and drift, the nitrogen incorporated into Sm2TiO5 film can 
reduce the low-k silica layer at the Sm2TiO5/Si interface and 
hence improve the sensing characteristics. 
We prepared an enzymatic EIS-based glucose biosensor 
from these devices, using glucose oxidase as the 
biocomponent. The biosensor measured the glucose 
concentration by detecting the variation in pH caused by the 
generation of hydrogen ions by the dissociation of glucose 
acid. For the detection of glucose, we used the entrapment 
method to immobilize the enzyme, using an alginate and 
CaCl2 solution, which reacted to form calcium alginate, on a 
Sm2TiO5 sensing membrane. This immobilization procedure 
preserved the native properties of the entrapped enzyme. Fig. 
3 presents the shift in the reference voltage of the enzymatic 
EIS-based glucose biosensor incorporating a Sm2TiO5 sensing 
film as a function of the glucose concentration. The sensitivity 
of this biosensor device, in terms of its response to glucose 
concentrations between 2 and 8 mM, was 7.71 mV/mM.  
We developed high-performance EIS devices using high-k 
Sm2TiO5 sensing membranes deposited on Si substrates by 
reactive co-sputtering. The high-k Sm2TiO5 EIS device 
annealed at 900 °C exhibited an optimum pH sensing 
performance including a higher sensitivity of 59.27 mV/pH, a 
smaller hysteresis voltage of 2.72 mV and a lower drift rate of 
1.15 mV/h. This improvement is attributed to the lower 
number of crystal defects and the higher surface roughness 
occurred at this condition. Furthermore, an enzymatic 
EIS-based glucose biosensor incorporating a Sm2TiO5 sensing 
membrane exhibited a sensitivity toward the detection of 
glucose of 7.71 mV/mM.
