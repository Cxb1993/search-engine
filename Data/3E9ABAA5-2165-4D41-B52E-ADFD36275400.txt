ABSTRACT 
With the development of the color 
science and technology in digital 
printing to reach the goal of what you 
see is what you get, three basic color 
management technologies in 
characterization of equipment, color 
appearance, and color gamut mapping 
were usually used. In the past the main 
printing researches were focus on paper 
material but not on textile. In this study, 
three kinds of color gamut mapping 
methods, cut, linear and nonlinear 
through the color correction, were used 
to process the standard images, and print 
them on paper and cotton substrates 
respectively. The difference between 
individual standard image and its output 
printed on one of the substrates tested 
was also estimated by measuring the 
color difference between the color 
samples randomly chosen on both 
original and out-put images respectively. 
Finally the category judgment method 
was used to analyze the color 
reproduction of the standard images 
printed in cross-medium. The results 
show that the factor of substrate has a 
significant effect on images processed 
using the gamut-mapping methods 
tested. The nonlinear one has the best 
performance in duplicating colors of 
standard images on the substrate of 
paper while the linear one the best on 
that of cotton fabric. 
Keywords: color correction, 
gamut-mapping method, color science,

ABSTRACT  Accumulating eight-year color images of fashion apparels as fundamental samples, this article is 
proposed to discuss the application of vogue colors, and the relativity between the apparel-color image presented and 
original one. Therefore, both color psychophysical and new color-image estimation methods were used in this research. 
The results show that the spring-summer (SS) fashion apparels do not have too sweeping change in their own hues 
between 2001 and 2008, but those color appearances are more brilliance. It means that SS fashion apparels have the 
lively characteristic. In addition, the Autumn-winter (AW) samples were not much difference from the SS ones in hue. 
Meanwhile, the former has lower brightness than the latter, giving the warm feeling. A phenomenon was found that 
some designers might design products according to their own subjectivity, resulting in not agreeing with the relative 
mutual recognitions of most consumers. 
Keywords: color image space, color appearance, color psychophysical method, spring-summer clothes 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
In recent three decades, a lot of efforts of working on colour were completed. But, all systematical studies on colour 
have just started for several centuries. Meanwhile, these studies were mostly concentrated on colour physics, colour 
product design, and colour psychology but colour image scales were conducted. In addition, it has become a more and 
more important and interested subject to integrate the humanities and science since the late of last century. Referring to 
the correspondence between colour and sound, Gombrich says in the last chapter of his book Art and Illusion1: “Can the 
world of the mind, of the dream, be explored by experiments that result in accepted conventions as was the world of the 
waking eye? Much of our assessment of twentieth-century art may depend on our answer to this question, for though 
not all, or even most, of it is concerned with synesthesia proper, all or most of it tries to represent the world of the mind 
where shapes and colours stand for feelings.” Just as Kandinsky2 proposed investigating the subject at the theoretical 
level, Gombrich suggested focusing attention on the structural relationships in the system rather than on the similarity 
of the elements, being his conviction that “the problem of synesthetic equivalences will cease to look embarrassingly 
arbitrary and subjective if … we fix our attention not on likeness of elements but on structural relationships within a 
scale or matrix”1, and followed by Sebba3 and Lee and Kuo4. Furthermore, Kobayashi5 and Kuo6 then focused on the 
relationship between colour and colour image. Meanwhile, it has become an important subject to integrate both 
humanities and science technology. A new color image space HRU with one kind of merit color image scales (WIP)7 
was derived using the psychophysical method, magnitude estimation method by Kuo, to overcome the shortcomings of 
the NCD such as the color image of common works could not be precisely quantified by the NCD, even 
incomprehensibly expressing the magnitude of the strength of a specific color image in comparing two colors. 
Meanwhile, the communication would be difficult between the CIEL*a*b* color space and the NCD. Therefore, the 
applications of the NCD would be limited. Therefore, an application of the new color image space to investigate the 
tendency of the fashion colors employed by designers was also described in this study. Also, the results of this study 
would be advantage to the application in the reproduction technology of color images. 
 
The HRU New Color Image Space 
 The new color image scales WIP mentioned as above can be used to quantify the magnitude of three color-image 
factors for various colors. And, there are six elements (i.e. semantic differential pairs of words) having similar meaning
