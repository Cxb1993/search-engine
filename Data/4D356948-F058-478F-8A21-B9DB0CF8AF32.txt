2. Reference Modeling for Nonlinear
Dynamic Systems
The plant is a single-input/single-out nth-order
system with 1n
  tduxgxfyn )( . (1)
The system is said to have a relative degree n, if g(x)
is bounded away from zero.
Assumption 1： g(x) is bounded away from zero over
a compact set nR ,
 ,0bxg x .
The control goal is for the plant output y to track a
reference trajectory ry . The reference control input r
can thus be defined by the following reference model:
   

and here denotes the Laplace variable.
If f(x), g(x) are known, and Assumption 1 is

3. Smooth Control Input
The“chatering” phenomenonis a common problem
that occurs to the switching control input of a sliding
mode control system. How to derive control laws that
maintain the system close to the sliding surface (S＝0)
while avoiding chattering altogether is an important
question to answer. In general, chattering must be
eliminated for the controller to perform properly. As
shown in figure (1), this can be achieved by smoothing
out control discontinuity in a thin boundary layer
neighboring the switching surface
   txSxtB ;)( , 0 , (5)
where  is the thickness of the boundary layer.

So, the H tracking performance in (19) is
achieved. This completes the proof.

transformed into a certain form of LMI. That is, by the

simulation is rapidly, asymptotically stable and the GA-
Based H -MAFSMC can be derived to stabilize and
control the system.
6. Conclusions
A GA-Based H modified adaptive fuzzy sliding
model controller for the handling the nonlinear systems
is described in this paper. We first track the reference
trajectory to approximate an uncertain and nonlinear
plant via fuzzy model involving FLC rules. Then, we
utilize a GA to decide on the initial values of the
consequent parameter vector ˆ. The H tracking
problem is characterized in terms of solving an
eigenvalue problem. The smoothing of control
discontinuities inside a thin boundary layer, essentially
as a low-pass filter structure, is introduced into these
updated laws for the elimination of chattering and to
guarantee that the state errors converge within a
specified error bound. Next, an MAFSMC is proposed
to stabilize the system, and achieve H control
performance at the same time. A stability criterion is
also derived from Lyapunov’s direct method to ensure
the stability of the nonlinear system. The stability
analysis can thus be reduced into LMI problems.
Finally, we discuss an example, a numerical simulation.
We demonstrate that the control methodology can
rapidly and efficiently control an uncertain and
nonlinear system.
