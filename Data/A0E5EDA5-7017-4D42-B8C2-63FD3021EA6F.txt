Abstract: Interaction of an elliptically cylindrical layered media with an arbitrarily oriented crack 
embedded in an infinite matrix, intermediate layer, or inner inclusion under a remote uniform load 
is considered in this paper. Based on the technique of conformal mapping and the method of 
analytical continuation in conjunction with the alternating technique, the solution for a screw 
dislocation located in an infinite matrix, intermediate layer or inner inclusion is first derived in an 
explicit form. By applying the existing complex potential solutions for a dislocation density 
function, the logarithmic singular integral equations for a line crack are formulated and mode-III 
stress intensity factors are obtained numerically. The effects of material property combinations and 
geometric parameters on mode-III stress intensity factors are discussed in detail and shown in 
graphic form. Based on a correspondence principle, the real-time stress intensity factors for the 
corresponding viscoelastic problem can be obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform. The 
result shows that the stress intensity factor decreases with time at begin then converges to a constant 
for long time. 
 
 
Keywords: elliptically cylindrical layered media, arbitrarily oriented crack, conformal mapping, 
mode-III stress intensity factors. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
The interaction between dislocations and inhomogeneities has received appreciable attention in order to evaluate 
the degree of failure of composite structures. The solution of a screw dislocation interacting with the inhomogeneity 
was first provided by Head (1953), who investigated the screw dislocation in the vicinity of a planar bimaterial interface. 
Smith (1968) studied a screw dislocation interacting with a circular inhomogeneity. He also extended the problem of a 
dislocation interacting with an elliptic hole in antiplane elastostatics. Gong and Meguid (1994) presented the solution 
for a screw dislocation interacting with an elastic elliptical inhomogeneity. Xiao and Chen (2000) and Liu et al. (2003) 
2. Problem Statement and Conformal Mapping 
Consider a cross section of three-phase confocally elliptical composite in an unbounded matrix with an arbitrarily 
oriented crack subjected to a remote uniform load as shown in Figure 1. Let Ω1 denote the matrix, Ω2 denote the 
intermediate layer, and Ω3 denote the inner inclusion, respectively. The boundaries of intermediate layer are two 
confocal ellipses Γ1, Γ2 with a1, a2, and b1, b2, being the major and minor semi-axes for each, respectively. Let the 
medium contain a line crack with length 2c and angle β with respect to the x axis. A line joining Tip-A and the origin 
makes an angle α with respect to the x axis and the distance h is measured from Tip-A to the intersection between that 
line and the elliptic boundary.  
 
The geometry of the problem is transformed by mapping the confocal ellipse Γ1, Γ2 in the z-plane onto the 
concentric circles L1, L2 in the ζ-plane with radii ρ1, ρ2 as shown in Figure 2. The conformal mapping functions is 
expressed as

It also transforms the segment from -l to l in the z-plane onto the circle L3 of radius 1/R in the ζ-plane. 
 
Based on the complex variable theory for a two-dimensional antiplane elasticity, the resultant force P, 
displacement ω, and stress component σxt & σyt can be written in terms of a single complex potential θ (ζ) as follows 
      Im  dxdyP ytxt (3)

     'ytxt i (5) 
    ittnt ei (6) 
 
where Re and Im denote the real part and imaginary part of the bracketed expression, respectively. The quantities σxt, σyt 
are the components of shear stresses in x and y direction, respectively, t is the unit tangent of σ, n is the outward unit 
normal at the interface which in complex form is equal to eiγ (where γ is the angle between the normal direction n and 
the positive axis x). (‘) is designated as the derivative with respect to the associated argument and μ stands for the shear 
modulus. Once the antiplane problem is solved, the complex potential θ (ζ) is determined.  
 
3. Complex Potential Formulation 
3.1 Homogeneous Solution 
The complex potential for an infinite homogeneous medium subjected to a remote uniform shear load τ∞ directed 
at an angle 90°from x-axis is given by the simple expression 
 
ziz   )(0 (7) 
 
With the aid of the mapping function (1), the homogeneous solution in the ζ-plane can be rewritten as

Since the result of   21a  is valid for the region |ζ| ≤ ρ1, it can not satisfy the continuity condition at the interface

Next, we introduce two functions   31a  and   21b  respectively holomorphic in |ζ| ≤ ρ2 and |ζ| ≥ ρ2 to satisfy the 
continuity conditions of the displacement and resultant force across the interface L2 that

But the result of   31a  is valid for the region |ζ| ≤ ρ2, it can not satisfy the continuity conditions across L3. Additional

Since the points t3 = (1/R)eiη and t3 = (1/R)e-iη correspond to the same points of the segment from -l to l in the

obtained by substituting Eqs. (9), (10) and (43) into Eq. (42). 
 
4. Crack Interacting with Three-Phase Elliptical Composite  
The singular integral equations for this problem can easily be written down by using the dislocation solutions as 
the Green’s function together with the principle of superposition.  
 
First, to model the crack embedded in the infinite matrix it is necessary to place a dislocation distribution  sbz  
along the prospective site of the crack. In this case, we simply substitute zb  by  sbz  and make integration along the 
crack. The corresponding homogeneous solution associated with a single crack can be expressed as

The unknown function )( sb z  for a crack located in the inner inclusion can be obtained numerically by using the 
Eqs. (46), (60), and (61) together with Eq. (47). Accordingly, the mode-III stress intensity factors can also be obtained 
from Eqs. (50) and (51). 
 
 
 
5.  Viscoelastic Formulation of a Trimaterial 
For a linear viscoelastic material, the strains or stresses at any given time are the sum of the individual strains or 
stresses increments through the respective time intervals during which they have been applied. By Boltzman’s 
superposition principle, the relationship between strains and stresses can be written in a hereditary integral

for , 1, 2, 6m n   . Taking the Laplace transform, it becomes 
 
ˆ ?( ) ( ) ( )m mn np s p p   (63) 
 
where ˆˆ ( ) ( )mn mns p ps p  . Equation (63) is analogous to the elastic constitutive equation. Then, the real time solution 
can be found numerically by the direct inverse Laplace transform 
 
presence of stiffer intermediate layer or stiffer inner inclusion. It is noted that a very soft intermediate layer (inner 
inclusion) should be combined with a very stiff inner inclusion (intermediate layer) in order to achieve the mixing 
behavior.  
 
6.2 A Crack Located in Intermediate Layer 
The variation of dimensionless mode-III stress intensity factors versus dimensionless location of a crack (h/a2) for 
different material property combinations are shown in Figures 9-10. In this case, the geometric conditions are 
represented by b2/a2 = 0.8, a1/a2 = 1.3 for a confocal ellipse and c/a2 = 0.1, α = β = 0° for a crack. Figure 9 shows that 
the existence of a stiffer (or softer) intermediate layer compared to the inclusion may give the enhancement (or 
retardation) effect on KIII*(tip-A) when a crack is approaching the inner inclusion. Figure 10 shows that the existence of 
a softer matrix compared to the intermediate layer may always give the enhancement effect on KIII*(tip-B).  
 
6.3 A Crack Located in Inner Inclusion 
The variation of dimensionless mode-III stress intensity factors (KIII*(tip-B)) versus dimensionless location of a 
crack (h/a2) for different material property combinations are shown in Figure 11. In this case, the geometric 
configurations are represented by b2/a2 = 0.8, a1/a2 = 1.1 for a confocal ellipse and c/a2 = 0.1, α = β = 0° for a crack. 
Figure 11 shows that the existence of a stiffer (or softer) inclusion compared to the intermediate layer may give the 
enhancement (or retardation) effect on KIII*(tip-B) when a crack is approaching to the intermediate layer.

2  Problem Formulation 
Consider a three-phase confocally elliptical composite in an unbounded matrix with arbitrarily 
oriented line crack subjected to a remote uniform shear load (see Fig. 1). Let Ω1 denote the matrix, Ω2 
denote the intermediate layer, and Ω3 denote the inner inclusion, respectively. The boundaries of 
intermediate layer are two confocal ellipses Γ1 , Γ2 with a1, a2 and b1, b2 being the major and minor 
semi-axes for each, respectively.  
For a two-dimensional antiplane deformation, the resultant force P and displacement ω can be 
expressed in terms of a single complex potential θ(ζ) as 
      Im  dxytdyxtP  (1)
Re[ ( )]    (2)
 
where Re and Im denote the real part and imaginary part of the bracketed expression and μ stands for 
the shear modulus, respectively. Once the antiplane problem is solved, the complex potential θ(ζ) is 
determined. 
Consider a composite subjected to a remote uniform shear load τ∞, the complex potential of the 
corresponding homogeneous problem is given by the simple expression 
 
ziz   )(0  (3)
 
In order to solve the crack problem, we next consider a single traction-free crack 2c to be situated 
in the matrix under a remote uniform shear load. By placing a continuation distribution of dislocation 
along the crack 2c, the corresponding homogeneous solution can be expressed as

The complete solution will be obtained by substituting Eqs. (22) and (23) into Eq. (9). 
 
Due to the traction-free condition along the crack surface, the total resultant force p(ζ) across the 
crack surface must be balanced by the given resultant force p∞(ζ)  across the segment 2c in the 
unflawed media. In addition, the single-valued condition of the dislocation density must be satisfied. 
Once the coefficients b0,j are solved, the mode-III stress intensity factors can be obtained. 
4  Numerical Results 
To demonstrate the effect of material property combinations on mode-III stress intensity factors, the 
graphics of dimensionless mode-III stress intensity factors (KIII*(tip-A)) versus dimensionless location 
of a crack (h/a2) for three-phase confocally elliptical composite are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4, 
respectively. In this case geometrical parameters b2/a2 = 0.8, a1/a2 = 1.1 for an elliptic and c/a2 = 1, α 
= β = 0° for a crack are used.

It is noted that all the numerical results are calculated by summing up to n = 5 in Eq. (9), since 
they are checked to achieve a good convergent as shown in Fig. 5, respectively. This demonstrates the 
accuracy and the efficiency of our method.

An analytical exact solution of an interaction between a line crack embedded in an infinite matrix 
with an elliptically cylindrical layered media under a remote uniform shear load is presented in this 
paper. Numerical calculations are performed to investigate the effect of material properties 
combinations on mode-III stress intensity factors and to show the efficiency of this method.

Antiplane interaction of a crack embedded in an infinite matrix with an elliptically cylindrical layered 
media under a remote uniform shear load is considered in this paper. The proposed method is based on 
the technique of conformal mapping and the method of analytical continuation that is alternatively 
applied across two different interfaces in order to derive the solution in a series form from the 
corresponding homogeneous solution. To analyze the interaction between a crack and an elliptically 
cylindrical layered media, the existing solutions for screw dislocation functions are used to formulate the 
integral equations for a line crack, and mode-III stress intensity factors are obtained numerically. The 
effects of material property combinations on mode-III stress intensity factors are discussed in detail and 
shown in graphic form.

2  Problem Formulation 
Consider a three-phase confocally elliptical composite in an unbounded matrix with arbitrarily 
oriented line crack subjected to a remote uniform shear load (see Fig. 1). Let Ω1 denote the matrix, Ω2 
denote the intermediate layer, and Ω3 denote the inner inclusion, respectively. The boundaries of 
intermediate layer are two confocal ellipses Γ1 , Γ2 with a1, a2 and b1, b2 being the major and minor 
semi-axes for each, respectively.  
For a two-dimensional antiplane deformation, the resultant force P and displacement ω can be 
expressed in terms of a single complex potential θ(ζ) as

where Re and Im denote the real part and imaginary part of the bracketed expression and μ stands for 
the shear modulus, respectively. Once the antiplane problem is solved, the complex potential θ(ζ) is 
determined. 
Consider a composite subjected to a remote uniform shear load τ∞, the complex potential of the 
corresponding homogeneous problem is given by the simple expression

In order to solve the crack problem, we next consider a single traction-free crack 2c to be situated

region |ζ| ≥ 1/R, which can be expressed in terms of θ0a(ζ)  and θ0b(ζ) by the following procedure.  
 
Step 1: Analytical continuation across the L1 interface 
 
First, we introduce two complex functions θb11(ζ)  and θa12(ζ)  respectively holomorphic in |ζ| ≥ ρ1 
and |ζ| ≤ ρ1 to satisfy the continuity conditions of the displacement and resultant force across the 
interface L1 (t1= ρ1eiη) that

for n ≥ 2 
 
The complete solution will be obtained by substituting Eqs. (22) and (23) into Eq. (9). 
 
Due to the traction-free condition along the crack surface, the total resultant force p(ζ) across the 
crack surface must be balanced by the given resultant force p∞(ζ)  across the segment 2c in the 
unflawed media. In addition, the single-valued condition of the dislocation density must be satisfied. 
Once the coefficients b0,j are solved, the mode-III stress intensity factors can be obtained. 
4  Numerical Results 
To demonstrate the effect of material property combinations on mode-III stress intensity factors, the 
graphics of dimensionless mode-III stress intensity factors (KIII*(tip-A)) versus dimensionless location 
of a crack (h/a2) for three-phase confocally elliptical composite are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4, 
respectively. In this case geometrical parameters b2/a2 = 0.8, a1/a2 = 1.1 for an elliptic and c/a2 = 1, α 
= β = 0° for a crack are used.

It is noted that all the numerical results are calculated by summing up to n = 5 in Eq. (9), since 
they are checked to achieve a good convergent as shown in Fig. 5, respectively. This demonstrates the 
accuracy and the efficiency of our method. 
5 Conclusion 
An analytical exact solution of an interaction between a line crack embedded in an infinite matrix 
with an elliptically cylindrical layered media under a remote uniform shear load is presented in this 
paper. Numerical calculations are performed to investigate the effect of material properties 
combinations on mode-III stress intensity factors and to show the efficiency of this method.
