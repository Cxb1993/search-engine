This report consists of four parts: (1) on the performance of using multiple 
transmit and receive antennas in pulse based ultra-wideband (UWB) systems; (2) on 
the performance of UWB systems in IEEE 802.15.3a channels with lognormal fading 
and Poisson arrival rays; (3) bit error rate (BER) analysis in IEEE 802.15.4a UWB 
channels with Nakagami fading and hyper-exponential inter-arrival rays; (4) 
BER-minimized space-time-frequency (STF) codes for multi-input multi-output 
(MIMO) highly frequency-selective block-fading channels. 
In the first part, we present an analytical expression for the signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) of the pulse position modulated (PPM) signal in a UWB channel with multiple 
transmit and receive antennas. We consider a generalized fading channel model that 
can capture the cluster property and the highly dense multipath effect of the UWB 
channel. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the derived analytical model can 
accurately estimate the mean and variance properties of the pulse based UWB signals 
in a frequency selective fading channel. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent 
the performance of the PPM based UWB system can be further enhanced by 
exploiting the advantage of multiple transmit antennas or receive antennas. Our 
numerical results show that using multiple transmit antennas in the UWB channel can 
improve the system performance in the manner of reducing signal variations. 
However, because of already possessing rich diversity inherently in the UWB channel, 
using multiple transmit antennas does not provide diversity gain in the strict sense 
(i.e., improving the slope of BER v.s. SNR), but can possibly reduce the required

Abstract
This paper presents an analytical expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the pulse position
modulated (PPM) signal in an ultra-wideband (UWB) channel with multiple transmit and receive
antennas. We consider a generalized fading channel model that can capture the cluster property and
the highly dense multipath effect of the UWB channel. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the
derived analytical model can accurately estimate the mean and variance properties of the pulse based
UWB signals in a frequency selective fading channel. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent the
performance of the PPM based UWB system can be further enhanced by exploiting the advantage of
multiple transmit antennas or receive antennas. Our numerical results show that using multiple transmit
antennas in the UWB channel can improve the system performance in the manner of reducing signal
variations. However, because of already possessing rich diversity inherently in the UWB channel, using
multiple transmit antennas does not provide diversity gain in the strict sense (i.e., improving the slope
of bit error rate (BER) vs. SNR), but can possibly reduce the required fingers of the Rake receiver for
the UWB channel. Furthermore, because multiple receive antennas can provide higher antenna array
combining gain, multiple receive antennas technique can be used to improve the coverage performance
for the UWB system, which is crucial for a UWB system due to the low transmission power operation.

[13] and [14]. In [13], the authors evaluated the performance of the pulse-amplitude modulation
(PAM) signals in the UWB MIMO channel. In [14], the authors proposed a space-time block
code scheme for the PPM based UWB system in the flat fading real channel, where the received
pulses through the radio channel are assumed to be orthogonal with each other.
To our best knowledge, it has not been seen many reports in the literature to evaluate the
performance of the PPM based UWB system using multiple transmit and receive antennas is in
a frequency selective multipath fading environment. The objective of this paper is to investigate
to what extent transmit/receive diversity can further improve the performance for the PPM based
UWB system.
Toward this end, we first analyze the statistical properties of the PPM signals in a generalized
frequency selective fading model proposed for the UWB system [15]. To accurately evaluate
the UWB system performance, choosing an appropriate channel model is very crucial. In the
literature, many models have been reported to characterize the UWB channel, such as [5], [16]–
[21]. In particular, according to the measurement results of [16], [19], the authors in [15] proposed
a generalized fading channel model for the UWB application, which can possess two major
properties of the UWB channel - clustering property and highly frequency selective fading.
Through simulations, we demonstrate that the derived analytical model can accurately estimate
the first-order and the second-order statistics of the pulse based UWB signals in the considered
UWB channel model.
Secondly, we investigate the effect of applying the transmit/receive antenna diversity tech-
niques in the UWB system. Specifically, we consider a time-switched transmit diversity (TSTD)
scheme [22] at the transmitter end, and the template-based pulse detection using antenna di-
versity at the receiver end [12]. Through simulations, we show that using multiple transmit
antennas in the UWB channel can improve the system performance in the manner of reducing
signal variations. Because of already possessing rich diversity inherently, using multiple transmit
antennas does not provide diversity gain in the strict sense (i.e., the slope of BER vs. SNR),
but can reduce the complexity of the Rake receiver. As for the effect of receive diversity, we
demonstrate that the multiple receive antennas can improve the performance of the UWB system
by providing higher antenna array combining gain even without providing the diversity gain in
the strict sense.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes a generalized frequency
3
where Γ(α) =
∫∞
0
tα−1 exp(−t)dt, and σ2l = 1nlE[a2l ]. In the following, we discuss the way to
calculate the terms nl and E[a2l ].
B. The Number of Simultaneous Arrival Paths
The clustering property in the UWB channel can be characterized by a modified Poisson
process driven through a two-state Markov chain [16]. If a resolvable path appears in the previous
time bin, a Poisson arrival process will be in the high state with µH average simultaneous arrival
paths; otherwise, it will be in the low state with µL average simultaneous arrival paths, where
µH > µL. Let nl denote the simultaneous arrival paths in the l-th time bin. Then,
Prob[nl = k] =
 µH
k
k!
e−µH , when nl−1 6= 0;
µL
k
k!
e−µL , when nl−1 = 0.
(4)
Note that the transition probability of a Poisson process with a mean of µH changing to that
with a mean of µL can be calculated by α = e−µH ; or similarly, β = 1 − e−µL represents the
transition probability from the low state to the high state.
C. Average Resolvable Path Power
We apply the exponential decay model to characterize the received signal power a2l in the
time domain [19]. Obviously, if nl = 0, E[al] = 0. When nl 6= 0,
E[al2] =
 1, when l = 0;γ · e−η(l−2), when l ≥ 1, (5)
where η is the decay constant, and γ is the power adjustment factor except the first path.
III. SIGNAL MODEL AND DETECTION SCHEME
A. Signal Model
Consider a single user employing binary PPM in the UWB channel. Let Tf and Tc be the frame
time and the chip time of the PPM signal, respectively. With the transmitted pulse waveform
wtr(t), the transmitted signal for the i-th message bit d(i) is written as [3]:
s
(i)
tr =
Np−1∑
j=0
wtr(t− jTf − c(i)j Tc − d(i)δTc), (6)
5
B. Signal Detection
Similar to [3], [12], [23], we consider a template-based detection scheme for the PPM signals.
It is assumed that perfect channel knowledge is available at the receiver. Having two possible
output waveforms x0 and x1 for message bit d(i) = 0 and d(i) = 1 defined in (10) and (11),
respectively, we can choose p0 = x0 and p1 = x1 and represent a template signal p for the
binary PPM case as
p = −p0 + p1. (12)
Now we take r1 as an example. Consider a Rake receiver with L fingers and denote the processed
data zp1 as the inner product of the received data r1 of (11) and the template p of (12). Then
we have
zp1 = pT r1 = (−p0T + p1T )r1

where sp1 =
∑L−1
i=0 xixi is the signal part, rp1 = −
∑L−δ−1
i=0 xixi+δ is the redundancy part,
np1 =
∑L−1
i=0 ni+δxi is the noise part of the processed data zp1 from p1, and np0 = −
∑L−1
i=0 nixi
is the noise part of the processed data zp1 from p0. From (13), we can use the sum of the
pulse correlator outputs as the test statistics to detect the transmitted symbol. Specifically, if the
processed data zp1 is larger than zero, the transmitted message bit d(i) = 0; otherwise, we take
the transmitted message bit d(i) = 1.
IV. ANALYSIS OF PPM UWB SIGNALS
A. The State Probabilities of the Modified Poisson Process
Consider a two-state Markov chain of (4) with the probability α = e−µH changing from the
high state to the low state, and the probability β = 1− e−µL changing from the low state to the
high state. Then, the transition probability matrix P is represented as
P =

where piH(·) is defined in (16), E[al2] is described in (5), L is the number of fingers in the Rake
receiver, δ is the modulation index associated with binary PPM, and σn is the standard deviation
of the Gaussian noise.
Proof: From (13), we can express the variance of the processed data zp1 as follows:
VAR[zp1]
= VAR[sp1] + VAR[rp1] + VAR[np1] + VAR[np0] +
2COV[sp1, rp1] + 2COV[sp1, np1] + 2COV[sp1, np0] +
2COV[rp1, np1] + 2COV[rp1, np0] + 2COV[np1, np0]. (20)

(piH(4)piH(3)− piH(l)piH(l + 3))E[a2l ]E[a2l+3]. (25)
From (22) to (25), we can compute VAR[sp1] of (19). The remaining terms of (19) will be
derived in Appendix II.
C. SNR for PPM signal in the UWB channel
With the mean and the variance of the processed data z, we can compute the energy of a
PPM signal in the UWB channel as
Sp1 = E[s2p1] = E[sp1]
2 + VAR[sp1], (26)
where
E[sp1] =
L∑
l=1
piH(l)E[a2l ], (27)
E[a2l ] is given in (5), and VAR[sp1] can be obtained from (21). As for the noise energy Np1, it
can be calculated by
Np1 = VAR[rp1] + VAR[np1] + VAR[np0]
+ E[rp1]2 + E[np1]2 + E[np0]2, (28)
11
Represent SNDp1 and N
ND
p1 as the signal energy and the noise energy of the processed data z
ND
p1 ,
respectively. Then, we have
SNDp1 = 4E[sp1]
2 + 4VAR[sp1], (35)
where VAR[sp1] and E[sp1] can be obtained from (21) and (27), respectively. Furthermore, the
noise energy NNDp1 can be derived as
NNDp1 = 2σn
2
L−1∑
l=0
piH(l)E[al2]
+ 2
L−δ−1∑
l=0
piH(l)piH(1 + δ)E[a2l ]E[a
2
l+δ]. (36)
Thus, by substituting related channel information of al and piH(l) into (36), NNDp1 can be also
obtained analytically. From (35) and (36), we show how to calculate SNRNDp1 analytically.
B. Receive Diversity
Consider the receive diversity scheme (Tx1-Rx2) having repetition codes with Np = 2 as
shown in Fig. 1 (b). We express the processed data zRDp1 for the receive diversity scheme as
follows:
zRDp1 = z
ND
p1,T1 + z
ND
p1,T2, (37)
where the superscript RD means receive diversity. Clearly, we can use the same method of
obtaining E[zNDp1 ] in (33) to compute the mean of the processed data z
RD
p1 , which is defined as
E[zRDp1 ] = E[z
ND
p1,T1] + E[z
ND
p1,T2]. (38)
Likewise, the variance of the processed data zRDp1 can be calculated by
VAR[zRDp1 ] = VAR[z
ND
p1,T1] + VAR[z
ND
p1,T2]. (39)
Denote SRDp1 and N
RD
p1 as the signal energy and the noise energy of the processed data z
RD
p1 ,
respectively and recall that the (Tx1-Rx2) receive diversity scheme and repetition length Np = 2
is considered. Then we have
SRDp1 = 16E[sp1]
2 + 8VAR[sp1] (40)
and
NRDp1 = 2N
ND
p1 . (41)

time, and tl is the arrival time of each resolvable path. Then, in our simulations, the mean
excess delay Tm =
∑N
l=1(tl−TA)al2∑N
l=1 al
2
= 34.61 nanoseconds, and the root mean square delay spread
TRMS =
√∑N
l=1(tl−Tm−TA)2al2∑N
l=1 al
2
= 37.98 nanoseconds.
B. Average SNR and Variance of the Pulse Based UWB Signals
Figure 3 compares the SNR of PPM signals for no diversity, receive diversity, and transmit
diversity schemes. Through simulations, we validate the analytical results obtained by (35), (36),
(40), (41), (45), and (46) in Section IV. From Fig. 3, one can find that the SNR of the receive
diversity is the highest, while the no diversity scheme and the transmit diversity have the similar
SNR.
Figure 4 shows the variance of PPM signals with no diversity, receive diversity, and transmit
diversity schemes in the UWB channel by analysis and simulations. From the viewpoint of the
signal variance, transmit diversity is the best, no diversity ranks second, and receive diversity is
the worst. Here, we assume that the antennas of both receive diversity and transmit diversity are
mutually independent.
Figure 5 shows the effect of spatial correlation ρ of transmit diversity on the variance of the
PPM signals over the UWB channel. As shown in the figure, the variance of the PPM signals
increases as the correlation of transmit diversity increases. From the results, it is implied that the
diversity gain of transmit diversity may not be significant in the UWB channel. In the following,
we will quantify the performance difference between no diversity and having antenna diversity
in terms of BER performance.
C. Comparison for Different Diversity Schemes for the PPM UWB System
Figure 6 shows the BER performances of different diversity schemes for the binary PPM
signals in the UWB channel. In the figure, the numbers adjacent to Tx and Rx represent the
numbers of the transmit and receive antennas; L represents the finger number in the RAKE
receiver; f represents the frame number; and δ represents the modulation index associated with
the message bit which is an integer multiple of the chip time Tc. From Fig. 6, we have the
following observations:
• Comparing the no diversity (Tx1-Rx1) scheme to the time switched transmit diversity (Tx2-
Rx1) scheme, one can find that the TSTD scheme can improve BER performance by about
15
the cases of L > 50 with single antenna (with the triangle legend) and that of L > 30 with
two transmit antennas (with the squared legend) are about the same. Nevertheless, transmit
diversity can slightly improve the BER performance for the PPM UWB system from the
signal variance perspective as explained in Fig. 4.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have derived an analytical expression for the PPM signal in an UWB channel
characterized by the cluster effect and highly dense frequency selective fading. Furthermore, we
have demonstrated that the time-switched transmit diversity combined with the template-based
pulse detection can improve the performance of the PPM based UWB system.
Through analysis and simulations, we have the following two major remarks:
• Although multiple transmit or receive antennas cannot deliver diversity gain for the UWB
system in the strict sense (i.e., improving the slope of BER vs. SNR), multiple transmit
antennas can improve the system performance in the manner of reducing signal variations.
Thus, transmit antennas can be used to reduce receiver complexity since the number of
fingers of a Rake receiver in the UWB system can be very high.
• Multiple receive antennas can provide higher antenna array combining gain. Because the
transmitted power in the UWB system is extremely low, multiple receive antennas techniques
can be an effective approach to improve the performance from the view point of coverage
extension.
Some possible interesting research topics that can be extended from this work include the
derivation of analytical BER performance for the PPM signals in the highly dense frequency
selective fading channel. Furthermore, it is worthwhile developing an analytical model to in-
corporate the effect of time-hopping and multiple access interference in a MIMO UWB system
with clustering property and highly dense frequency selective fading. Last but not the least, the
provided analytical method to calculate the signal energy in the UWB channel can be extended
to the pulse amplitude modulation case.

Abstract
In this paper, we present a computable bit error rate (BER) expression for the binary signals in the
IEEE 802.15.3a ultra-wideband (UWB) channel. Although this UWB channel model is widely adopted,
the performance in such a UWB channel is mainly evaluated by simulations instead of analysis. The
unique characteristics of the cluster property and the highly dense multipath effect in this kind of
UWB channel make performance analysis interesting but challenging. Mathematically, the signal in
such a UWB channel can be characterized by a joint lognormal and Poisson random signal, where
the lognormal random variable models the fading amplitude and the Poisson random variable models
the clustering effect. We present a BER computation method that can include the effects of all the key
parameters in the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel, consisting of the cluster/ray arrival rate, the cluster/ray
decay factor, the number of rays per cluster, lognormal fading and lognormal shadowing. Furthermore,
in the proposed BER computable formula, the effect of number of fingers of the RAKE receiver is also
considered.

variable. The mean of the signal amplitude is related to the arrival time of clusters and rays
which are modeled by two independent Erlang random variables. Hence, it is not easy to
analyze such a complicated random signal.
In short, a UWB signal in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model can be characterized by a joint
two-dimensional lognormal and doubly stochastic Poisson random variable. Key parameters in
this UWB channel include the cluster/ray arrival rates, the cluster/ray decay factors, and the
standard deviations of the lognormal fading and shadowing. To our knowledge, in the context
of IEEE 802.15.3a channel, a computable bit error rate (BER) formula for the RAKE receiver
considering all the UWB channel parameters has not been presented in the literature.
B. Related Work
In the following we summarize some of the research related to the performance analysis of
UWB systems.
On the one hand, based on simpler channels, the UWB system has been investigated [4]–[7].
In [4], the authors derived the theoretical BER of binary and M-ary UWB signals under the
AWGN channel and multiple access interference. In [5], the authors studied the performance
of UWB systems in the AWGN channel in the presence of the interference from the wideband
code division multiple access (WCDMA) of the universal mobile telecommunications system
(UMTS). The BER performances of the UWB system under flat and dispersive Rayleigh fading
channels with timing jitter were derived in [6]. The authors in [7] adopted a moment-generating
function approach to analyze the performance of a transmit-reference (TR) UWB system under
a slowly fading channel.
On the other hand, based on more sophisticated UWB channels, [8]–[12] investigated the
performance of UWB systems. The main concept in [8] was to derive a computable formula
for the average bit error probability of binary signals in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model
when the received waveform is observed over a finite window. In the IEEE 802.15.3a channel
model, it is a challenging task to derive the distribution of the collected signal energy because
the numbers of clusters and rays are random. In [8], the authors applied the techniques of
counting integrals and shot noise random variables to derive the computation BER formula.
In [9], they further investigated the statistics of the output SNR at the RAKE receiver, but
the explicit BER formula was not presented and the shadowing effect was not considered. In

II. BACKGROUND
A. IEEE 802.15.3a UWB Channel Model
In this section, we discuss the key attributes of the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel [1]. The
impulse response in this UWB channel is expressed as
hi(t) = Xi
Nc−1∑
l=0
Nr−1∑
k=0
α
(i)
k,lδ(t− T (i)l − τ (i)k,l ) , (1)
where i refers to the i-th realization, Xi represents the lognormal shadowing (i.e., 20 log(Xi) ∝
Normal(0, σ2x)), {α(i)k,l} are the multipath gain coefficients, T (i)l is the delay of the l-th cluster,
τ
(i)
k,l is the delay of the k-th multipath component relative to the l-th cluster arrival time (T
(i)
l ).
Note that Nc (the number of clusters) and Nr (the number of rays in a cluster) are both random
variables. By definition, we have τ0,l = 0.
The cluster inter-arrival time and the ray inter-arrival time are characterized by exponentially
distributed random variables. That is, given the (l − 1)-th cluster’s arrival time Tl−1 for l ≥ 1,
the probability density function (PDF) of the l-th cluster’s arrival time Tl is expressed as
p(Tl|Tl−1) =
Λexp[−Λ(Tl − Tl−1)], Tl > Tl−1,0, otherwise, (2)
where Λ is the cluster arrival rate. Similarly, for the arrival time of the (k− 1)-th ray in the l-th
cluster τ(k−1),l, the PDF of the arrival time of the k-th ray in the l-th cluster τk,l is
p(τk,l|τ(k−1),l) =
λ exp[−λ(τk,l − τ(k−1),l)], τk,l > τ(k−1),l, k ≥ 1,0, otherwise, (3)
where λ is the ray arrival rate. Note that T0 = 0 in the line-of-sight (LOS) channel, whereas T0
is an exponential random variable in the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channel:
p(T0) =
Λexp(−ΛT0), T0 > 0,0, otherwise. (4)
The channel coefficients (αk,l) are defined as follows:
αk,l = pk,lξlβk,l , (5)
where pk,l is equiprobable ±1 to account for signal inversion due to reflections, ξl reflects the
fading associated with the l-th cluster, and βk,l corresponds to the fading associated with the
35
root x(H)k is given by
w(H)k =
2N
(H)−1N (H)!
√
pi
(N (H))2
[
HN (H)−1(x
(H)
k )
]2 . (11)
The remaining term RN (H)(ξ) is equal to
RN (H)(ξ) =
N (H)!
√
pi
2N (H)(2N (H))!
f (2N
(H))(ξ), (12)
where ξ is an unknown real number. The values of x(H)k and w
(H)
k of the Gauss-Hermite formula
with N (H) = 20 are already pre-calculated in [13]. Consequently, an improper integration of a
function f(x) can be accurately approximated by a simple summation.
III. BER ANALYSIS
A. Problem Formulation
For a coherent RAKE receiver with L fingers, the received SNR γb is
γb =
Eb
N0
L∑
m=1
a2m , (13)
where Eb/N0 is the bit SNR and am is the channel amplitude at the m-th finger of the RAKE
receiver normalized to the total energy. Based on the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model, am is the
sum of lognormal fading and shadowing amplitudes of rays in many clusters which arrive in the
duration of the m-th finger. That is,
am = X ·
∑
(k,l):(m−1)Tc≤Tl+τk,l<mTc
αk,l , (14)
where Tc is the chip duration between two fingers. Define E ,
∑L
m=1 a
2
m as the normalized
received energy in the UWB channel. From (14), it follows that
E = X2 ·
L∑
m=1
 ∑
(k,l):(m−1)Tc≤Tl+τk,l<mTc
αk,l
2 . (15)
From [15] we know that the error probability of binary signals with the coherent RAKE receiver
is
P2(γb) = Q
(√
γb(1− ρr)
)
, (16)
where ρr = −1 and ρr = 0 for antipodal signals and orthogonal signals, respectively.
37
Rm(ν) and Sm(ν) can be obtained. With L0,0(ν), Rm(ν), and Sm(ν), ΨAm(ν) can be obtained
according to (19).
Let B =
∑L
m=1A
2
m and denote fB(x) and fX2(x) as the PDFs of B and the squared lognormal
shadowing random variable X2, respectively. In Appendix I, we show that the PDF of E can be
expressed as
fE(z) =
∫ ∞

Calculating (20) requires the use of multiple-dimension integrals, especially including ΨAm(·)
of (22). Specifically, computing P2 of (17) based on this method requires (6L + 4)-dimension
integrals.
2) Method 2: To ease the computation load of Method 1, we suggest a BER approximation
method in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model. First we conjecture that the characteristic function
of the sum of squared combined signal amplitudes at each of L fingers can be approximated
by that of the sum of squared signal amplitudes at each individual ray within a time window
[0, LTc]. Because each cross term αk,lαj,n for k 6= j and l 6= n in (15) is equiprobably positive
or negative due to the term pk,l in (5), all the odd-order moments will vanish. In other words,
given an odd number q, we have
E[(αk,lαj,n)q]
=
1
4
(ξlβk,l)
q(ξnβj,n)
q +

4
(ξlβk,l)
q(−ξnβj,n)q + 1
4
(−ξlβk,l)q(ξnβj,n)q + 1
4
(−ξlβk,l)q(−ξnβj,n)q
= 0. (23)
To ease computation, a new random variable E˜ , which is the sum of squared path gains of the
clusters and rays which arrive within the time window [0, LTc], is used to represent the signal
39
where the function ψ˜ν(T, L) can be computed by
ψ˜ν(T, L) =

∫ LTc
T
[1− L˜T,t(ν)]dt, T ≤ LTc ,
0, T > LTc .
(30)
Moreover, S˜(ν, L) is equal to
S˜(ν, L) = exp[−ΛJ˜(ν, L)] , (31)
where
J˜(ν, L) =
∫ LTc
0
[1− L˜T,T (ν)e−λψ˜ν(T,L)]dT. (32)
Proof: See Appendix III.
Substituting (26) into (30) and (32), we can obtain R˜(ν, L) and S˜(ν, L), respectively. The
characteristic function ΨE˜X0(ν) of the received energy E˜X0 without shadowing at the RAKE
receiver with L fingers in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model can be obtained easily using (25).
The PDF of E˜X0 can be computed as follows:
fE˜X0(x) =
1
2pi
∫ ∞
−∞
ΨE˜X0(ν)e
−jxνdν. (33)
Finally, the PDF of E˜ can be computed as follows:
fE˜(x) =
∫ ∞
−∞
1
|y|fX2
(
x
y
)
fE˜X0(y)dy. (34)
C. Computable Formula
We apply the Gauss-Hermite formula to calculate the characteristic function L˜T,t(ν) of the
squared signal amplitude at a path with cluster arrival time T and ray arrival time t. Let y =
1√
2σ
(10 log10 x − µT,t) in (26). It follows that x = 10(
√
2σy+µT,t)/10 and dy
dx
= 5
√
2
(ln 10)σx
. Then, we
can obtain the Hermite computation form for L˜T,t(ν) as follows:

Importantly, one can see that (40) requires only two integrals in the last line including the
integral for evaluating the Q function. Other integrals are replaced by the summations based on
the Hermite and the Legendre polynomial methods with the N (H)-th and N (L)-th orders.
IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS
A. Simulation Method
In order to verify the derivation of the BER formula presented in the last section, we perform
simulations by using MATLAB. For pulse position modulation (PPM) signals, the transmitted
signal of the information bit 0 is
s0(t) =
1, 0 ≤ t < Tc,0, otherwise. (41)
Here we set Tc = 1 nsec. When the information bit is 1, the signal waveform s1(t) = s0(t−δTc)
for a positive integer δ. From the uwb sv model ct function in [1], we can get the output
vectors h and t. The vector t stores the arrival time of every channel impulse response with
increasing chronological order, while the vector h stores the corresponding amplitudes.
We define a template vector p0 with size 1× (L+ δ), where the m-th element of p0 (denoted
by p0[m]) is equal to
p0[m] =

∑
n:(m−1)Tc≤t[n]<mTc
h[n], 1 ≤ m ≤ L,
0, L < m ≤ L+ δ.
(42)
The physical meaning of vector p0 is the received signal for the information bit 0, excluding
the noise with the sampling rate 1/Tc. For the information bit 1, the template vector is
p1 = [01×δ,p0[1], · · · ,p0[L]]. (43)
43
formulas may cause some integration errors. Basically, we find that using fE˜(x) instead of fE(x)
can save much calculation time and provide reasonably well approximation on BER performance
in the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel.
Figure 5 shows the PDF fE˜(x) in the channel model CM1 for various values of finger numbers
at the RAKE receiver, i.e., L = 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. In the low energy range, the curve of
L = 10 has the most probability mass; the curve of L = 20 ranks second; the curve of L = 30
ranks third; the curve of L = 40 ranks fourth; and the curve of L = 50 has the least probability
mass. This phenomenon can explain why the case of L = 10 has the worst BER performance
compared to L = 20, 30, 40, and 50.
Figure 6 shows the effect of various numbers of fingers of the RAKE receiver on the BER
performance of orthogonal binary signals (i.e. ρr = 0) in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel models
CM1 ∼ CM4. We set Eb/N0 = 5 dB. The same parameters to obtain Fig. 4 are used. For a
given Eb/N0, we simulate 100,000 bits. In general, the BER decreases as L increases because
the RAKE receiver can collect more energy. For a large value of L, the BER curves become
flat because the RAKE receiver captures almost all the channel energy. The figure shows that
the four channels actually give almost the same BER result (about 6× 10−2) when the number
of fingers is increased up to 80.
Furthermore, it would be interesting to compute the confidence interval. By the central limit
theorem, an 100(1− α) confidence interval can be expressed as
(x¯− Z1−α/2s/
√
M, x¯+ Z1−α/2s/
√
M), (46)
where x¯ is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, M is the sample size, and
Z1−α/2 is the (1 − α/2)-quantile of a standard normal random variable. For example, say the
goal is to find the 95% confidence interval of the BER for CM2 at Eb/N0 = 1 dB. From Fig. 4,
the P˜2 = 0.19259 at Eb/N0 = 1 dB. Thus the sample mean be x¯ = 0.19259. In each simulation,
an output bit is either the same as or different from the information bit. Thus, it is the same as
a Bernoulli process with parameter p and the sample standard deviation s =
√
p(1− p). Note
that p can be estimated by x¯. For α = 0.05, one can obtain Z1−α/2 = 1.95996 by either table
lookup or integration. This leads to
Z1−α/2s/
√
M = 1.95996
√
0.17131(1− 0.17131)/100, 000 = 2.44406× 10−3. (47)

Combining (50)–(53) and
fB(x) =
1
2pi
∫ ∞
−∞
e−jνxΨB(ν)dν, (54)
we can get (22) by the use of some algebra. Because E = X2B, it remains to find the PDF of
X2. Since X is a lognormal random variable satisfying 20 log10X ∝ Normal(0, σ2x), its PDF
can be expressed as
fX(x) =


[
−200
(
log10 x

)2]
xσx ln 10
, x > 0,
0, x ≤ 0.
(55)
Again using the result in [17, Example 7b], we can find that the PDF of X2 is as in (21).
Finally, from Example 3.3-1 in [18] we know: For two random variables X ′ and Y ′ with
known joint PDF fX′,Y ′(x, y), the PDF of the new random variable Z = X ′Y ′ is
fZ(z) =
∫ ∞
−∞
1
|y|fX′,Y ′
(

, y
)
dy. (56)
Since X2 and B are independent, we have fX2,B(x, y) = fX2(x)fB(y). Applying this relation
to (56), we then get (20).
APPENDIX II
PROOF OF THEOREM 1
Let fG|T,t(x) be the PDF of the path gain G , αk,l arriving at time t that is part of a cluster
that started at time T . According to [16], fG|T,t(x) can be written as
fG|T,t(x) =
1

[f|G||T,t(x) + f|G||T,t(−x)], (57)
because the path gain is positive or negative with equal probability of 0.5. [Recall the definition

I. INTRODUCTION
ULTRA-wideband (UWB) technology is a promising communications technique to achievehigh data rates for the next-generation wireless systems. Generally speaking, the first
important step in designing a wireless system is to accurately model its channel characteristics.
Based on more measurement results, the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model [1] is a more general
UWB channel and thus has been widely adopted by industry and academia. The next important
step before designing a wireless system is to simulate or analyze the UWB system performance
based on the developed realistic channel model. The simulation approach is straightforward and
easier but time-consuming. By contrast, the analytical approach is more attractive since it is more
flexible to evaluate the impacts of various channel parameters, although it is difficult to obtain an
analytical model for a sophisticated channel such as the IEEE 802.15.4a model. Currently, the
performance of the UWB system in the IEEE 802.15.4a standardized channel model are mainly
evaluated by simulations.
The IEEE 802.15.4a UWB standardized model contains many channel parameters. In the
IEEE 802.15.4a channel, there are nine sets of channel parameters specified for various UWB
propagation environments. These channel parameters include the cluster and ray arrival rates, the
inter-cluster and intra-cluster decay constants, the mean and variance of Nakagami-m parameter,
the Nakagami-m factor for the strongest components, and the shape of the alternative power delay
profile (PDP). Clearly, it is time consuming and not very flexible to simulate a UWB system in
the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model by changing various values of many channel parameters in
each simulation run.
Hence, we are motivated to develop an analytical model to evaluate the UWB system perfor-
mance in the IEEE 802.15.4a standardized channel. The challenges of analyzing UWB systems
in the IEEE 802.15.4a channel can be summarized in the following two aspects:
• Unlike a narrow-band channel with a fixed number of impulse responses of a single cluster,
UWB signals consist of a random number of clusters and rays. In the IEEE 802.15.4a
channel model, the number of clusters is modeled by a Poisson random variable (i.e., with
exponential inter-arrival time between two cluster), whereas the inter-arrival time of rays
within a cluster is modeled by a hyper-exponential random variable. Due to the random
number of clusters and rays, the distribution of the collected signal energy involves an infinite
57
Mathematically, the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model yields a UWB signal characterized by a
joint continuous and discrete multi-dimension random variable consisting of Nakagami-m fading
amplitude, Poisson distributed number of clusters, and a hyper-exponential inter-ray arrival time.
To our knowledge, an analytical model to include all the effects of channel parameters specified
in the IEEE 802.15.4a model has rarely appeared in the literature. Thus, the first objective of
this paper is to develop an analytical model based on the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model. The
second objective is to evaluate the impacts of different UWB channel parameters by applying
the newly developed analytical model. It is difficult and time consuming to achieve this goal by
simulations.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the IEEE 802.15.4a
channel model. In Section III, we provide the mathematical background for counting integrals
that is required later to analyze the IEEE 802.15.4a channel. In Section IV, we derive the
analytical expression for the BER performance of the antipodal and orthogonal binary signals
under the IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel. We show the numerical results in Section V and give
concluding remarks in Section VI.
II. IEEE 802.15.4A UWB CHANNEL MODEL
A. Power Delay Profile
Based on the Saleh-Valenzuela (SV) method, the impulse response of the IEEE 802.15.4a
UWB channel [1] is characterized as
h(t) =
L∑
l=0
K∑
k=0
ak,l exp(jφk,l)δ(t− Tl − τk,l) , (1)
where ak,l and τk,l are the amplitude and the relative delay of the k-th ray at the l-th cluster,
respectively; Tl is the delay of the l-th cluster; and the phases φk,l of the k-th ray at the l-th
cluster are uniformly distributed in the range [0, 2pi]. By definition, τ0,l = 0. A Poisson random
variable with mean L¯ is used to model the probability density function (PDF) of the number of
clusters L, i.e.,
fL(L) =
(L)L exp(−L)
L!
. (2)
59
B. Small-Scale Fading
The small-scale fading amplitude is characterized by a Nakagami-m random variable:
fa(x) =
2
Γ(m)
(m
Ω
)m
x2m−1 exp
(
−m
Ω
x2
)
, (9)
where m is the fading parameter, Γ(·) is the gamma function, and Ω is the mean-square value of
the signal amplitude. Noteworthily, the Nakagami-m fading parameter m is also another lognor-
mal random variable with mean µm and standard deviation σm in the dB domain. Furthermore,
µm and σm are linear functions of the delay (τ ), i.e.,
µm(τ) = −kmτ +m0 (10)
and
σm(τ) = −k̂mτ + m̂0, (11)
where m0, m̂0, km, and k̂m are constants. The Nakagami-m parameter for the first component
of each cluster is assumed to be deterministic and independent of delay.
C. Comparisons between 3a and 4a Channel
Table I compares the IEEE 802.15.3a and 802.15.4a channel models. As shown in the table,
these two channel models are different in amplitude fading, ray inter-arrival time, ray decay
factor, and power delay profile. Furthermore, the 4a model specifies the path loss model, but the
3a model does not.
III. MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND
The IEEE 802.15.4a channel model can be viewed as a joint random process associated with
time-of-arrivals and multipath amplitudes. First, the time-domain random variables contain the
arrival time of all the clusters and rays, i.e., the variables {Tl} and {τk,l}. Second, the amplitude-
domain random variables contain the amplitudes ak,l of all the channel impulses. Due to the
random number of clusters and rays, analyzing such a UWB signal will involve infinite numbers
of random variables (ak,l, φk,l, Tl, and τk,l for all nonnegative integers k and l). To make this
problem tractable, the channel impulse response h(t) of (1) can be rewritten as
h(t) =
∑
n
Gnδ(t− tn), (12)
61
exploiting the counting integral, the original probability problem with infinitely many random
variables can be transformed into an integral with only two dummy variables s and p. The
characteristic function of Φ in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel was derived in [12]. We will apply a
similar technique to obtain the characteristic function of Φ in the IEEE 802.15.4a channel and
derive the BER performance of the UWB system, as discussed in the next section.
IV. BER ANALYSIS
A. Receiver Structure
For a coherent M -finger RAKE receiver, the received SNR γb is expressed as
γb =
Eb
N0
M∑
i=1
|ci|2 , (16)
where Eb/N0 is the SNR per bit, ci is the channel amplitude that appears at the i-th finger of
the RAKE receiver. From [15], the conditional error probability of binary signals with a given
γb at the coherent RAKE receiver can be computed by
P2(γb) = Q
(√
γb(1− ρr)
)
, (17)
where ρr = −1 and 0 for antipodal signals and orthogonal signals, respectively. To obtain γb,
we derive the characteristic function of the received energy E ,∑Mi=1 |ci|2, where
ci =
∑
(k,l):(i−1)Tc≤Tl+τk,l<iTc
ak,l exp(jφk,l), i = 1, . . . ,M, (18)
E =
M∑
i=1
∣∣∣∣∣∣
∑
(k,l):(i−1)Tc≤Tl+τk,l<iTc
ak,l exp(jφk,l)
∣∣∣∣∣∣
2
, (19)
and Tc is the chip duration between two fingers.
B. Characteristic Function of Received Energy
Similar to the case for the IEEE 802.15.3a channel model, the calculation of the characteristic
function of E requires many integrals and long computation time [9]. Thus, we find the char-
acteristic function of the sum of the squared path gain for those impulses arriving in the time
interval [0,MTc] (denoted by E˜), i.e.,
E˜ =
∑
(k,l):0≤Tl+τk,l≤MTc
a2k,l. (20)
63
Second, to calculate the function R(ν,M), we derive the closed form expression for the ray
arrival rate λ(τ) in the IEEE 802.15.4a channel. According to the IEEE 802.15.4a channel model,
the ray inter-arrival time is modeled by a hyper-exponential random variable with two different
rates, λ1 and λ2, as shown in (4). The effective ray arrival rate λ of the whole time-of-arrival
process can be computed by the following lemma.
Lemma 1: The effective ray arrival rate λ of the time-of-arrival process in the IEEE 802.15.4a
channel model can be expressed as
λ(τ) =

βλ1e−λ1τ+(1−β)λ2e−λ2τ
βe−λ1τ+(1−β)e−λ2τ , τ ≥ 0,
0, τ < 0,
(26)
where τ = t− T is the ray arrival time with respect to the cluster arrival time.
Proof: See Appendix I.
Now we give the formulas of the characteristic functions R(ν,M) and S(ν,M).
Theorem 2: For the M -finger RAKE receiver in the IEEE 802.15.4a channel, the characteristic
function R(ν,M) of the sum of the squared amplitude of the rays in the first cluster except for
a0,0 can be written as
R(ν,M) = exp[−ψν(0,M)], (27)
where the function ψν(T,M) is computed by
ψν(T,M) =

∫MTc
T
[1− LT,t(ν)]λ(t− T )dt, T ≤MTc,
0, T > MTc.
(28)
The characteristic function S(ν,M) of the squared amplitude of the rays in the other clusters
except for the first cluster can be written as
S(ν,M) = exp[−ΛJ(ν,M)], (29)
where
J(ν,M) =
∫ MTc
0
[1− LT,T (ν)e−ψν(T,M)]dT. (30)
Proof: See Appendix II.
65
1. Unlike J(ν,M) in (30) where Λ is a fixed value, in a general case Λ(T ) is a function of T .
Thus, J(ν,M) is redefined as
J(ν,M) =
∫ MTc
0
Λ(T )[1− LT,T (ν)e−ψν(T )]dT . (33)
Similarly, the characteristic function Ψ(ν) of the received energy is rewritten as
Ψ(ν) = L0,0(ν) exp[−ψν(0,M)] exp[−J(ν,M)] . (34)
Note that exp[−ψν(0,M)] is the same as R(ν,M) in (27), but exp[−J(ν,M)] is slightly different
from S(ν,M) in (29).
V. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Based on the developed analytical model, we now evaluate the effect of different UWB channel
parameters, including the cluster arrival rate Λ, inter-cluster decay constant Γ, intra-cluster decay
constant γ0, ray arrival parameters (λ1, λ2, and β), and the mean of the Nakagami-m factor (m0).
A. Simulation Method
To check the correctness of the derived BER formula in the IEEE 802.15.4a channel, we
perform simulations by using MATLAB. We consider a 10-finger RAKE receiver in the CM1
model of the IEEE 802.15.4a standard. For a PPM signal, the information bit “0” is expressed
by
s0(t) =
1, 0 ≤ t < Tc,0, otherwise. (35)
Similarly, the signal waveform for the information bit “1” is denoted by s1(t) = s0(t−δTc), where
δ is a positive integer and Tc = 1 nsec in our simulations. From the uwb sv model ct 15
4a.m function in [1], we can obtain the output vector t, which stores the arrival time of
every channel impulse response in increasing chronological order, and the vector h storing the
corresponding amplitude.
We define a template vector p0 with size 1× (M + δ), where the i-th element of p0 (denote
by p0[i]) is equal to
p0[i] =

∑
n:t[n]=0 h[n], i = 1,∑
n:(i−2)Tc<t[n]≤(i−1)Tc h[n], 2 ≤ i ≤M,
0, M < i ≤M + δ.
(36)
67
D. Impact of the Ray Arrival Parameters λ1 and λ2
Figure 3 shows the effects of different values of ray-arrival parameter λ1 on the BER v.s. Eb/N0,
when λ2 = 0.15 and β = 0.095 according to the IEEE 802.15.4a model. The figure shows that
in the considered case, a larger λ1 results in lower BER. When λ1 increases, the RAKE receiver
can obtain higher energy from more rays. Compared with the impact of the cluster arrival rate,
changing λ1 yields smaller variations on the BER performance. This is because the cluster arrival
rate is a macroscopic parameter that influences all the clusters and λ1 is a microscopic parameter
that influences only rays within each cluster.
Figure 4 shows the impacts of various values of λ2 on the BER for the case λ1 = 1.54 and
β = 0.095. As shown in the figure, a larger value of λ2 leads to a lower BER. Compared to
Fig. 3, λ2 affects the BER more significantly than λ1. Referring to (4), the condition of β = 0.095
implies that ray interarrival time is decided by the parameter λ1 with a probability of 0.095 and
is decided by the parameter λ2 with a probability of 0.905. This explains why λ2 becomes a
more dominant parameter than λ1 in the case of β = 0.095.
E. Impact of the Ray Arrival Parameter β
Figure 5 shows the effect of various values of β on the Eb/N0 in the case λ1 = 1.54 and
λ2 = 0.15. From (4), we expect that when β increases, the ray process is more likely to choose
the arrival rate λ1 than λ2. According to CM1 model of the IEEE 802.15.4a channel, λ1 = 1.54
and λ2 = 0.15. Thus, a larger value of β indicates a higher ray arrival rate. Thus, the BER is
improved for a larger β in the considered case.
F. Impact of the Inter-Cluster Decay Constant Γ
Figure 6 shows the effect of various inter-cluster decay constants Γ. One can see that a larger
value of Γ yields a better BER performance. From (6) one can see that the total energy Ωl is
proportional to exp(−Tl/Γ). Thus, when Γ increases, the total energy Ωl of the l-th cluster also
increases. With more signal energy captured by the RAKE receiver, the BER performance is
therefore improved.
69
APPENDIX I
PROOF OF LEMMA 1
According to (4), the PDF of interarrival time of ray is
f(τ) =
βλ1e
−λ1τ + (1− β)λ2e−λ2τ , τ ≥ 0,
0, τ < 0.
(40)
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is
F (τ) =
∫ τ
−∞
f(x)dx
=
1− βe
−λ1τ − (1− β)e−λ2τ , τ ≥ 0,
0, τ < 0.
(41)
The ray arrival rate λ is the intensity function [17] of the interarrival time of rays:
λ(τ) =
f(τ)
1− F (τ)
=

βλ1e−λ1τ+(1−β)λ2e−λ2τ
βe−λ1τ+(1−β)e−λ2τ , τ ≥ 0,
0, τ < 0.
(42)
The ray arrival is indeed a nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The ray arrival rate is a function
of time τ . Note that when β = 1, the PDF in (40) reduces to the exponential PDF and the
intensity function reduces to the constant λ1. This case corresponds to a homogeneous Poisson
process.
APPENDIX II
PROOF OF THEOREM 2
Denote fY |T,t(y) as the PDF of squared amplitude Y corresponding to the cluster arrival time T
and ray arrival time t. Because Φr0 is a shot-noise random variable driven by a two-dimensional
Poisson process with intensity function λ(t)fY |0,t(y), the function R(ν,M) can be calculated as

Abstract
In this paper, we present bit error rate (BER)-minimized space-time-frequency (STF) block codes
for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) highly frequency-selective block-fading channels. We consider the
IEEE 802.15.3a ultra-wide band (UWB) channel models (CM) 1–4. Based on a new STF block codes
design criterion with the objective of minimizing BER, we develop an efficient searching algorithm
for the design of the optimal STF block codes which maximize the coding gain. For 128 subcarriers
with two subcarriers jointly encoding with 2–4 transmitting antennas, we find that the optimal STF
block codes for all the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel models CM 1–4 can be found. Furthermore, the
designed STF block codes outperform the recently published high-rate full-diversity STF codes [1] by
1 dB. Last, the proposed STF codes can be decoded by maximum likelihood decoding approach, which
is simpler than the sphere decoding principle used in [1].

3) Because traditional STF coding methods focus on linear codes, it will be challenging to
examine if there exist nonlinear optimal STF block codes.
To our best knowledge, the design of STF block codes for the MIMO-OFDM systems under
the IEEE 802.15.3a channel models considering all the three aforementioned challenges has not
been seen in the literature.
B. Related Work
Here, we introduce some related works about STFC for the MIMO-OFDM systems. In [3],
the authors investigated STFC for MIMO-OFDM and found an equivalence between antennas
and subcarriers. The authors then suggested a complexity-reduced scheme with coding across
subcarriers only. In [4], the authors proposed an adaptive STFC scheme according to the space-
frequency water-filling procedure for MIMO-OFDM systems. In [5], the authors considered
STFC over MIMO-OFDM block-fading channels and derived a sphere packing lower bound
on the average word error probability and an upper bound for pairwise word error probability,
but they did not show how to design the optimal codes to achieve these bounds. In [1], authors
proposed a systematic design method for high-rate full-diversity STF codes for broadband MIMO
block-fading channels. In [6], authors presented rate-two STF block codes for multiband UWB-
MIMO communication systems using rotated multidimensional modulation. We will show by
simulation that our proposed STF codes have better BER performance than the codes in [1] and
[6] do.
C. Objective and Outline of This Paper
The objective of this paper is to design the BER-minimized STF block codes for the MIMO
systems under four kinds of IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel models, i.e., CM 1 ∼ 4. The rest
of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we summarize the IEEE 802.15.3a channel
model. In Section III, we introduce our system model. In Section IV, we introduce the BER
analytical formula. In Section V we describe the design criterion, an efficient searching algorithm,
and the optimal codes in some examples. In Section VI, we discuss the properties of our proposed
optimal STF block codes. We show the numerical results in Section VII and give our concluding
remarks in Section VIII.

Through measurements in [2], some parameters in the IEEE 802.15.3a channel are specified
for four different environments, i.e., CM1, CM2, CM3, and CM4 for LOS (0-4 m), NLOS (0-4
m), NLOS (4-10 m), and extreme NLOS multipath channel with 25 nsec rms delay spread,
respectively.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
Figure 1 shows our system block diagram. First, we divide the information bits into groups.
Each group has two bits. Then we pass the bits to our STF block encoder. For example, if
we want to encode across two transmit antennas and two subcarriers, then the codeword can
be expressed as a matrix. Then we use an OFDM modulator to allocate every elements in the
codeword to corresponding subcarriers and transmit antennas. That is, dij is allocated on the
i-th subcarrier and j-th antenna, for i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2. The transmitted signals pass the
IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel. The receiver recovers the original information bits via inverse
operations as in the transmitter: We first use an OFDM demodulator to find the codewords. Then
we use a maximum likelihood (ML) STF block decoder to find the original information bits.

V. THE UNIVERSALLY OPTIMAL STF BLOCK CODES DESIGN
In this section, we describe a criterion and a efficient searching algorithm of the BER-
minimized STF block codes.
A. The Optimum Criterion
Our goal is to design the STF block codes to minimize Pe in (15). For given ρ, Nt, Nr, K,
and M , it is equivalent to maximize the term
q =
r∏
n=1
eign(S ◦RM) (17)
by designing the matrix S. Similar to the rank and determinant criteria of the space-time block
coding (STBC) [9], we have to maximize the minimal q along the pairs of distinct codewords.
We first consider the simplest case. Let Ni be the number of input information bits for each
codeword D. Let M = Nt = Ni = 2. Let b1, b2 ∈ {0, 1} be the two input bits. We use the
binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation. Let s1 and s2 be the two corresponding symbols,
then si = mod(bi) for i = 1, 2, where
mod(x) =
1, if x = 1,−1, if x = 0. (18)
The codeword D is a 2×2 matrix with each element being 1 or −1, i.e., D ∈ {1,−1}2×2. Then
there are 22·2 = 16 different codewords. Since there are two input bits, there are 22 = 4 possible
inputs, i.e., b1b2 ∈ {00, 01, 10, 11}. Hence, we have to choose four distinct codewords for these
four different inputs.
For the convenience of expression, let us define the demodulation function dem(x) , mod−1(x)
and the multiple digits version of dem(·) is defined as
dem(x) , [dem(x1), dem(x2), · · · , dem(xm)], (19)
where the vector x stands for an m-digit number and the i-th digit is xi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.
The following equation gives each codeword D a unique positive integer n as its subscript:
Dn =

 : bd(dem(d) + 1) = n

with the largest two metrics: 64 and 16.3314. After searching, we also find that there is no K4
in this graph. In Fig. 2(c), we consider the edges with the largest three metrics: 64, 16.3314,
and 16. We find that there are totally eight K4 in this graph, they are: {1, 7, 12, 14}, {1, 8, 10,
15}, {2, 8, 9, 15}, {2, 8, 11, 13}, {3, 5, 12, 14}, {3, 6, 12, 13}, {4, 5, 11, 14}, and {4, 6, 9,
15}. Note that we do not need to search for the case m > 3, because we already find that the
max-min value of q is 16.
We use the same method to search the optimal STF block codes for CM2, CM3, and CM4.
CM2 and CM3 both have the same optimal STF block codes as CM1 does, but there are nine
optimal STF block codes for CM4. These nine codes contains the eight optimal codes which are
the same as that of CM1 and an additional codes {4, 6, 11, 13}. This is an interesting discovery
that for different channel model, the optimal codes may be different. Thus, in order to design
the optimal codes, we have to take the channel model into account.
In order to design the codes that are optimal for all channel model, we choose the eight
optimal STF block codes for CM1 out of
(
22·2

)
= 1820 candidates. The next step is to transform
these codes to a code structure. Take the code {3, 5, 12, 14} as an example, which corresponds
to the K4 with bold edges in Fig. 2(c). According to the matrix-indexing procedure we defined
in Section V-A, we find these four integers correspond to the following codewords:
D3 =
−1 −1
1 −1
 , D5 =
−1 1
−1 −1
 ,
D12 =
1 −1
1 1
 , D14 =
 1 1
−1 1
 . (23)
We assign these four codewords to the information bits 00, 01, 10, and 11, respectively. Note
that we can choose another assignment and the max-min value of q will not change. To discover
the code structure from these codewords, we first consider the element in the first row and
first column of them. They are Di[1, 1] = {−1,−1, 1, 1}, where i ∈ {3, 5, 12, 14}. Since each
position can take values on −1 or 1, there are totally 24 = 16 possibilities. We establish a truth
table of these 16 values, as a function of s1 and s2. For some cases, we find it is more convenient
to express the function in terms of b1 and b2. The truth table is listed in Table I. Use this table

condition. The values of r for different kinds of optimal codes are listed in Table III. From this
table, we find a interesting fact. Sometimes the optimal codes achieve different diversity order
for different values of CM. For example, when M = 3, Ni = 2, Nt = 2, and the modulation is
BPSK, the diversity order is two for CM1 and CM2 and three for CM3 and CM4.
VII. NUMERICAL RESULTS
Our simulation environment is a multiband UWB MIMO system. The number of total sub-
carriers is 128 and the sub-band bandwidth is 528 MHz. We apply the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB
channel model CM 1 ∼ 4 [2].

4, respectively. As the same in the M = 2 case, when the number of channel model increases,
the BER decreases. However, unlike the M = 2 case which has diversity order of 2, the M = 3
case has diversity order of 2 for the Nt = 2 and CM = 1, 2, Nt = 3 and CM = 1 cases. The
diversity order equals to 3 for other cases. This can be seen both from Fig. 5 and Table III.
Moreover, as the number of transmit antennas Nt increase, the BER decreases. Thus, the optimal
STF block codes in the M = 3 case improve the BER performance when Nt increases. In the
M = 2 case, this phenomenon does not occur. On the other hand, compared with the M = 2
case, the M = 3 case has better BER performance. Hence, increasing the number of subcarriers
which are jointly encoded also improves the BER performance.
D. Effect of Number of Transmit Antennas Jointly Encoded (Nt) for Four Subcarriers Jointly
Encoded (M = 4)
Figure 6 shows the effect of number of transmit antennas jointly encoded on the BER for
CM 1 ∼ 4 for the optimal STF block codes for M = 4 and Ni = 2. Figs. 6(a) and 6(b) show
the BER for Nt = 2 and 3, respectively. Like the M = 3 case, the BER decreases as CM or
Nt increase. Different CM have different diversity orders. The M = 4 case also has better BER
performance than the M = 3 case does.
E. BER Comparison with STF Codes in [1] and [6]
Figure 7 shows the BER comparison of our code with Chusing’s code [6] and Zhang’s code
[1] for the M = 4, Ni = 2, Nr = 1, Nt = 2 case in the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel model
CM4. We can see that the diversity gains of the three codes are the same, but our code has
better BER performance than Chusing’s and Zhang’s codes do. At BER = 10−4, the coding gain
between our code and Chusing’s code is about 8 dB and the coding gain between our code and
Zhang’s code is about 1 dB.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we study the BER-minimized STF block codes design for the MIMO highly
frequency-selective block fading channels. We consider the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel model.
Based on the BER analysis under the aforementioned environment in [7], we provide a BER-
minimized design criterion, an efficient searching algorithm for the optimal STF block codes,

Our Code
Fig. 7. The BER comparison of our code versus Zhang’s code [1] and Chusing’s code [6] for three subcarriers jointly encoded,
two input information bits for each codeword, one receive antenna, and three transmit antennas jointly encoded in the IEEE
802.15.3a UWB channel model CM4. The modulation is BPSK.

of computer simulation time. Furthermore, the suggested analytical method can be 
applied to other multipath channel models with random numbers of clusters and rays 
by simply replacing the PDF of fading amplitudes. 
 
Part III 
 
In the third part, we have derived the BER analytical formula for a coherent 
RAKE receiver under the IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel model. Our proposed 
analytical method can accurately and quickly compute the BER values for the 
sophisticated IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel, and evaluate the impact of various 
channel parameters. We find that of all the parameters in the IEEE 802.15.4a channel, 
the inter-cluster arrival rate Λ has the most significant impact on the BER 
performance. We also observe that the BER can be lowered due to the increase on the 
inter-cluster arrival rate Λ, the inter-cluster decay constant Γ, the ray arrival 
parameters λ1, λ2, and β. We also find that increasing the intra-cluster decay constant 
γ0 causes the BER to first increase and then remain the same or even decrease. In 
general, the time-domain parameters in the IEEE 802.15.4a UWB channel affect BER 
performance quite significantly. This reflects the comment in [16], that time-of-arrival 
characteristics are more important than amplitude characteristics for MIMO-UWB 
systems. In the future, it would be worth extending the suggested analytical method to 
other multipath channel models with any given fading distribution, PDP, and cluster 
and ray inter-arrival time distributions. 
 
Part IV 
 
 In the last part, we study the BER-minimized STF block codes design for the 
MIMO highly frequency-selective block fading channels. We consider the IEEE 
802.15.3a UWB channel model. Based on the BER analysis under the aforementioned 
environment in [7], we provide a BER-minimized design criterion, an efficient 
searching algorithm for the optimal STF block codes, and optimal BER performance 
curves. Among our proposed optimal STF block codes, we find that almost all of 
them need nonlinear operations in the encoder. Thus it is necessary to consider 
nonlinear codes when we design the optimal STF block codes for the MIMO-OFDM 
systems under the IEEE 802.15.3a UWB channel model. When the number of 
subcarriers M which are jointly encoded is equal to two and the number of transmit 
antennas Nt is 2 ~ 4 or M = 3, Nt = 4 the optimal STF block codes for all the IEEE
