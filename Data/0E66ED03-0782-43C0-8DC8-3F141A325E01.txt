First of all, two input parameters, values of error e and change of error

e are defined,
and the triangular membership function as shown in fig.1 is adopted. The input parameters
include LN(large negative), SN(small negative), ZE(zero), SP(small positive) and LP(large
positive) fuzzy sets. It is found that membership function with higher discrimination
efficiency is more sensitive in control and more forceful in response, while the membership
function with lower discrimination efficiency has the is slower in response but becomes more
stable.
The control rules Rj are
Rj : if e is Ai1 and

e is Ai2 then Out is Bi
Where,
i : serial number of control rule

e,e : input parameter
Ai , Bi : fuzzy set
Therefore two input parameters which consist of five fuzzy sets individually can
produce an output parameter of 25 control rules as listed on Table1.
The weight counting method is applied to calculate the output f of fuzzy controller as
follows

where,
f : the output of fuzzy controller
iW : the desirable of i control rule
iB : the peak value of output membership function in i control rule
Accordingly, the change of control force in system can be obtained..
3. Analysis of the polymerase chain reaction chip
The glass base PCR chips with the advantages of easy acquirement and low costs are
applied in this paper. By applying the surface machining technology, a micro-resistor-heater
Table 2 illustrates four levels of each factor with the degree of freedom 15)14(5  .
Therefore the orthogonal array L16 is applied for optimization and its allocation pattern in the
experiment is show in Table 3.
(3) Quality characteristic
It is expected to obtained the smallest temperature overshoot and the least settling time so
that the quality characteristic is defined as the-smaller-the-better and the ideal function of the
quality characteristic is defined as zero (the quality characteristic is assumed to be positive).
Fig.5 shows the sampling points located at the center of the bottom of the DNA sample .
(4) Results
(i) Temperature overshoot
From the optimal analysis, the related experimental data is shown in Table 4, the factor
responses are shown in Table 5, and the minimum temperature overshoot is found to be
A1B1C4D1E4. Fig.6 shows the temperature response under the optimal factor combination.
It indicates that the highest temperature 93.949℃ occurs at 29.8 sec which exceeds our
expected setting time of 19.6 sec so that it is required to reestablish the objective function for
minimizing the setting time of the quality characteristic.
(ii) Settling time
From the optimal analysis, the related experimental data is shown in Table 6, the factor
responses are shown in Table 7, and the minimum settling time is found to be A4B4C4D1E2.
Fig.7 shows that the temperature response is so fast and the setting time is 5.34 sec. Although
Factors C and D are found to be same as the optimal combination of the temperature
overshoot, thus Factors A, B and C are contradictory to the optimal combination of the
temperature overshoot. Therefore the second stage optimization process is required. .
(iii) Second stage optimization
Two objective functions of minimum temperature overshoot and least settling time are
considered. As a result, the optimal combination is found to be A4B4C4D1E3. Fig.8 shows
the maximum temperature overshoot to be 1.175℃and the settling time to be only 3.2sec, and
the temperature oscillating at 94℃once the temperature passes the maximum overshoot. Such
results conform to our requirement.
