Abstract—The integration between EPON and WiMAX to 
form a Hybrid ONU-BS Architecture (HOA) is regarded as a 
superior solution for future access networks. Recently, the 
advantages of this hybrid network has attracts many 
researches and developers. A critical part of the HOA is packet 
scheduling, which resolves contention for bandwidth and 
determines the transmission order of users. For successfully 
realizing HOA deployment, evaluating the performance of 
hybrid uplink traffic scheduling algorithms is one of the most 
importance and issues. Therefore in this study we evaluate 
thoroughly the hybrid uplink traffic scheduling in terms of 
end-to-end delay, fairness, packet drop probability, jitter and 
throughput in different scenarios. We also address the scarcity 
and advantages of hybrid uplink traffic scheduling algorithms 
with different implementation in order to show their abilities 
in terms of Quality of Services (QoS) guarantees, fairness 
between traffic classes. Simulation results indicate that 
Interleaved Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (IDBA) has better 
overall system performance than IPACT even with different 
implementation of intra uplink traffic scheduling algorithms. 
Furthermore, intra uplink traffic scheduling algorithms have 
equivalent characteristics in light traffic load until it exceeding 
to 50% in terms of packet drop probability. We disclose that 
an effective, efficient, fair and robust uplink scheduler in the 
HOA is still open to the research area. In the conclusion of our 
study we make suggestions that can provides better 
understanding to design efficient schemes.  
Keywords- EPON, WiMAX, HOA, QoS, IDBA, Packet 
scheduling.  
I.  INTRODUCTION  
The increasing demand on bandwidth for broadband 
access network to support triple play service and provide 
access ubiquitously over the last few years has created new 
challenges among operators to investigate new architectures 
to provide such requirements at low cost. Optical access 
network at one hand can provide enormous amount of 
bandwidth to the users, but has limited flexibility and no 
mobility. Wireless at the other hand, does has mobility but 
provides limited amount of bandwidth. Obviously, the 
convergence between optical access network and wireless 
referred as fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) [1] will be the key role in 
the future. The Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON) 
[2], is regarded as a acceptable solution for the next 
generation fiber-based access technique as EPON fully 
merits the high-speed transmission, cost-effective, flexible 
and scalable. Contrary, in the wireless area, WiMAX [3] 
become rapidly growing broadband access technology that 
enables internet applications, and realizes the convergence of 
mobile and fixed broadband access in single air interface and 
network architecture. In addition, WiMAX also provide 
wider cell coverage, higher access capacity, and support 
Quality of Service (QoS). The major motivations behind the 
integration of EPON of WiMAX involve the potential 
advantages of the bandwidth benefit and the mobility feature 
that provides a single hierarchy network infrastructure for 
both wired and wireless access services, particularly in terms 
of capacity hierarchy. Thus the complementary of both 
networks have motivated deploy EPON as a backhaul (or 
feeder) to connect multiple disperse WiMAX base stations. 
Preliminary research on [4] employed a passive optical 
network as a feeder to connect multiple spread WiMAX base 
stations. The OLT considered as a central controller and 
coordinator to perform operations for the whole hybrid 
network, including packet forwarding and bandwidth 
allocation, etc. To fully exploit the benefits of EPON and 
WiMAX integration more architecture were proposed in [5]. 
These architectures include independent architectures, hybrid 
architectures, unified connection-oriented architectures, and 
microwave-over-fiber (MoF) architectures. Moreover, in the 
hybrid optical wireless architecture, B. Jung et al. [6] stated 
that the hybrid ONU-BS architecture has better end-to-end 
delay, QoS support, and bandwidth utilization than the others 
integration architecture. In order to provide anytime and 
anywhere connectivity with huge amount of bandwidth over 
the hybrid ONU-BS architecture, the hybrid uplink traffic 
scheduling plays a vital functions to ensure an efficient usage 
of both optical link and radio spectrum the hybrid ONU-BS 
architecture. The following are the technical issues to 
achieve seamless convergence of EPON and WiMAX in 
hybrid ONU-BS architecture (HOA): First, the DBA 
mechanism in central controller OLT to transmit data from 
CO to the ONU-BS then to the destination has the most 
important role that affect network performance significantly. 
Second, effectively QoS mapping mechanism is required to 
enhance class of service (CoS) between EPON and WiMAX 
to guarantee the QoS continuity in the integrated network. 
Third, integrated bandwidth allocation and packet scheduling 
should help to improve delay and throughput. Fourth, the 
integration should be effortless to provide layer 2 (L2) 
handover, since the handover controller located at OLT can 
handle user mobility in micro cells connected to EPON. 
Further, although numerous scheduling algorithms proposed 
in the EPON-WiMAX networks, there is no comprehensive 
study that provides a unified platform for comparing such 
algorithms.

bandwidth is allocated to each SS and then allocated to each 
service connection associated with the SS. Each connection 
in the uplink channel from SS to the BS is mapped to a 
scheduling service flow. The 802.16 protocol supports five 
types of QoS service classes: 1) Unsolicited Grant Scheme 
(UGS) is equal to multiplayer interactive gaming; 2) 
Extended Real Time Polling Service (ertPS) is similar to 
VoIP and Video conference; 3) Real Time Polling Service 
(rtPS) is similar to streaming media; 4) Non Real Time 
Polling Service (nrtPS); and 5) Best Effort Service (BE) 
such as web browsing, instant messaging and media content 
downloads. Each of services class has its own QoS 
parameters requirement, such as minimum throughput 
requirement, delay and jitter constraints. Therefore, based 
on the aforementioned different mechanism to maintain 
priority queues and classifies the packets between EPON 
and WiMAX we address this issues of how to map the 
packets in BS queues into ONU queues while maintaining 
the QoS requirements. This task is carried out by the QoS 
Mapping module in the hybrid ONU-BS.  
In order to provide guaranteed QoS for differentiated 
services, traffics should be allocated for both the service 
flows and the queues. Although the overall operational 
principles of the two types of networks are rather similar, 
particularly in the aspect of bandwidth request and allocation. 
WiMAX systems generally allocate bandwidth better than 
EPON systems. In addition, the connection-oriented 
bandwidth allocation generally shows more predictable QoS 
than the queue-based bandwidth allocation, which implies 
that WiMAX technology is expected to support better QoS 
than EPON technology. In contrast, EPON technology shows 
better operational scalability than WiMAX technology as 
each ONU is required to manage only up to eight priority 
queues. Because EPON and WiMAX use different 
operational protocols despite similarity in their bandwidth 
request/grant mechanisms, it is reasonably to modify the 
MAC layer protocols of EPON that support connection-
oriented services as in WiMAX systems.  
Moreover, the bandwidth should be constrained by the 
mapping policy of QoS management. As shown in Figure 2, 
wired and wireless access networks share the queues in the 
EPON system. Eight queues make up a PON link and each 
service flow have their own queues. By service self-aware 
technology, the EPONs support principal IP-based DiffServ 
mechanism to ensure the QoS of these applications [9]. For 
instance, the highest-priority class can be mapped to the 
expedited forwarding (EF) which for time-critical 
characteristic, low loss and bandwidth-guaranteed services 
that is typically constant bit rate (CBR), such as voice 
transmission. Furthermore, the medium-priority class can be 
mapped to the assured forwarding (AF). AF is intended for 
services that are not delay-sensitive but require bandwidth 
guarantees, which is typically variable bit rate (VBR) 
services, such as video stream. Finally, the low-priority class 
can be mapped to the best effort (BE), which is neither 
delay-sensitive nor bandwidth-guaranteed, includes web 
browsing, background file transfer and e-mail applications. 
In addition, the AF and BE traffics are more delay tolerant 
but generally have a wide-band nature; however, the EF 
traffic is very delay-sensitive but tends to be a narrow-band 
nature. A fixed and properly-sized cycle length with fixed 
position of EF traffic can provide lower delay and jitter 
guarantee. The Table I shows a proposed QoS mapping 
policy.  
 
B. Homogeneous Uplink Scheduling  
In hybrid ONU-BS architecture, all service flow share 
the same memory buffer of fixed size in ONU-BS for 
WiMAX and EPON traffic requirements. For a simple Strict 
Priority (SP) scheduling policy, the high priority packet can 
preempt the memory reserved for packets of lower priorities 
when the corresponding buffer is full. On the other hand, the 
lower-priority packet will be dropped when packet arrives 
and finds that the corresponding buffer is full. Therefore, in 
SP scheduling policy low-priority packets may get 
starvation when the proportion of high-priority traffic is 
high. For supporting QoS requirements, after the mapping 
configuration, scheduling policy and congestion control 
policy should be configured. This is conducted by the 
Admission Control module which only buffers admitted 
packets into ONU-BS queues. Admission control is one of 
the effective mechanisms to satisfy the demand for 
bandwidth request and enhance the efficiency of the system. 
Many admission control mechanisms can be found in the 
literature for both EPON and WiMAX but not considered in 
the integrated EPON and WiMAX architecture; therefore, 
this issue will be considered in this paper. We do a 
performance study in hybrid uplink traffic scheduling. 
Moreover, we propose an Innovated Custom Queuing (ICQ) 
to resolve the starvation problem faced by low-priority 
service traffics, end to end delay and QoS support ability in 
HOA.

B. Packet Drop Probability  
Figure 5, 9 and 13 compares the packet drop probability 
vs. traffic load for the inter scheduling IDBA and IPACT 
with intra scheduling FIFO, PQ, WFQ and ICQ scheduling 
mechanisms with 10MB buffer size in each ONU-BS. 
Simulation result shows that the proposed ICQ scheme has 
the better performance than the others schemes. Reversely, 
the PQ scheme has the worse dropping performance. The 
whole scheduling schemes begin dropping the packets when 
the traffic load exceeding 30% for IPACT and exceeding 
40% for IDBA. On the other hand, the PQ scheme has the 
worse performance in packet drop probability because of the 
low priority traffic in PQ will got starvation. When the 
network load is above 30%, we observe considerable packet 
loss due to buffer overflow. In spite of the ICQ scheme still 
has a better performance on packet loss ratio. The reason is 
that the ICQ has efficient and flexible bandwidth distribution 
queuing schedule. In addition, the packet drop probability

Simulation results show that the delay variance for EF traffic 
increases as the traffic load increases except for the PQ and 
ICQ scheme. The reason is that the PQ and ICQ transmits 
the entire high priority traffic of every ONU-BS in the 
beginning of transmission cycle time sequentially. Moreover, 
the EF jitter of inter scheduling IPACT is increasing when 
the proportion of CBR traffic increasing except for IDBA.  
D. Fairness  
Figure 7, 11 and 15 shows the fairness performances of 
the hybrid inter and intra scheduling for different traffic 
loads. The fairness index f (0≦f≦1) has been addressed 
[13] which is defined as equation (3).

where N is the total number of ONUs and G[i] is the 
granted bandwidth of ONUi. Jain’s fairness index f, 
ranging from 0 to 1, becomes 1 when all ONUs have the 
same amount of bandwidth allocated by the OLT.  
Simulation results show that Jain’s fairness index f of the 
IDBA is better than the IPACT, especially in IDBA_ICQ 
scheduling which has the best fairness performance, 
where the average f is about 0.87 for scenario one. The 
reason is that the proposed IDBA_ICQ not only can utilize 
the idle period but also can adaptively adjust the bandwidth 
for low priority traffic to resolve the starvation problem. 
Furthermore, based on the simulation scenarios, we observe 
that the whole fairness index will improve when CBR traffic 
is increasing.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS  
As a cost-effective, bandwidth benefit, mobility, and scalable 
solution to the broadband access network, integrated of 
EPON and WiMAX architecture - hybrid ONU-BS 
architecture (HOA) have the capability to deliver integrated 
broadband services by efficient fixed mobile convergence. 
This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation 
of a number of hybrid uplink traffic scheduling algorithms in 
HOA networks. The inter scheduling include IPACT and 
proposed IDBA and the intra scheduling include existing 
scheduling schemes, which include FIFO, PQ, WFQ and 
proposed Innovated Custom queuing (ICQ). Representative 
schemes from homogenous categories have been evaluated 
with respect to major distinguishing characteristics of the 
HOA. From table II (the parameter δ  represent the average 
performance index from traffic load 70% to 90%.) we can 
observe that the inter uplink scheduling has significant 
influence on overall end to end delay, loss rate and jitter 
performance. Moreover, the inter-IDBA scheduling 
outperforms the inter-IPACT scheduling in terms of avg. 
end-to-end delay, particularly for the PQ BE avg. end-to-end 
delay which has gain ratio approximately 33%. The gain 
ratio of performance index is defined as gain (in %) which is 
computed as follows:

where the α means different kinds of inter-scheduling DBA 
scheme, such as IPACT and IDBA, the β means the intra-
scheduling scheme, such as FIFO, PQ, WFQ and ICQ. The 
overall end-to-end delays can be decreased because IDBA 
can eliminate the idle period problems and effectively utilize 
the bandwidth rather than IPACT. Moreover, it also shows 
that jitter performance is influence by the inter uplink 
scheduling as well, predominantly in the FIFO. The IDBA 
has average jitter gain ratio approximately 57% over IPACT 
on overall intra-scheduling. Finally, we observed that the 
inter-uplink scheduling does not has to significant influence 
in terms of fairness. The average IDBA gain ratio of fairness 
is approximately 3% over IPACT. The intra-scheduling has 
influence on overall end to end delay, loss rate and fairness 
performance. The PQ gets the worse loss rate because of the 
low priority starvation problem. The ICQ present a good loss 
rate and fairness performance because of ICQ provides 
minimum delay of the highest priority traffic without 
sacrificing the low priority traffic bandwidth requirements.

networks which support triple play services (voice, video, 
and data) to multiple users simultaneously. The integration 
of optical and wireless networks presents a compelling 
solution for broadband access due to their complementary 
features of wide bandwidth and user mobility. Firstly, 
between different micro-cells, it is efficient to employ EPON 
as a backhaul to interconnect multiple detached WiMAX 
BSs so as to enable the communication between different 
micro-cells. Secondly, the integration can provide much 
convenience for the system operation and is expected to 
support better QoS and improve network throughput by 
employing efficient integrated bandwidth allocation and 
packet scheduling strategies. Thirdly, the integration can 
support not only broadband network access but also wider 
service coverage. 
Preliminary research on integration of EPON and 
WiMAX was described in [9], under the hybrid optical 
wireless research area. The hybrid networks in [9] employed 
a passive optical network as a feeder to connect multiple 
spread WiMAX base stations, the OLT be considered as a 
central controller and coordinator to perform operations for 
the whole hybrid network, including packet forwarding and 
bandwidth allocation, etc. To fully exploit the benefits of 
integration of EPON and WiMAX, more integration 
architectures were proposed in [10,11]. These architectures 
include independent architectures, hybrid architectures, 
unified connection-oriented architectures, and microwave-
over-fiber (MoF) architectures. Moreover, in the hybrid 
optical wireless architecture, B. Jung et al. [12] confirmed 
that the Hybrid ONU-BS architecture can support better end 
to end QoS support and bandwidth utilization than the other 
integration architecture.  
For achieved seamless convergence of EPON and 
WiMAX in hybrid ONU-BS architecture (HOA), there has 
some technical issues should be considered in the MAC layer 
[10]. First, integrated bandwidth allocation and packet 
scheduling should help to improve delay and throughput. 
HOA can process full information of bandwidth, and packet 
scheduling of the ONU and BS. There need a good queuing 
scheduling to improved delay and throughput performance 
by optimal utilize both fiber and radio bandwidth resources. 
Second, an effective QoS mapping mechanism is needed 
between EPON priority queues and WiMAX connections to 
provide better class of service (CoS). Consequently, 
guaranteeing QoS continuity in the integrated network can 
be achieved by designing an efficient QoS mapper that 
knows which WiMAX flows should be chosen to EPON 
priority queues. Third, the integration should make it easy to 
provide layer 2 (L2) handover because the handover 
controller located at OLT can handle user mobility in micro 
cells connected to EPON. Finally, the DBA mechanism in 
central controller OLT to transmit data from the ONU-BS to 
the destination tends to affect network performance 
significantly. Therefore, an effective QoS mapping and 
uplink scheduling algorism to improve end to end delay and 
end to end QoS support should be considered.

In spite of the numerous scheduling algorithms has been 
proposed in present network but comprehensive study for 
comparing such algorithms. The goal of this work is to 
allow a thorough understanding of the relative performance 
of representative uplink scheduling schemes and 
subsequently utilize the results to address their scarcity in 
designing more efficient schemes. In this paper, we focus 
our work on implementing homogeneous algorithm for the 
uplink traffic scheduling in integrated architecture of FTTx - 
EPON and WiMAX.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II 
presents a survey of homogeneous algorithm for uplink 
scheduling in hybrid ONU-BS architecture. This section also 
includes our proposed HOB architecture, the justification of 
selecting representative algorithms and QoS mapping in 
ONU-BS for our simulation study. Section III describes the 
simulation framework that includes the simulation 
parameters, traffic model, and the performance metrics used 
to evaluate the algorithms and the results and discussion of 
the experiments results. The conclusions and future work is 
summarized in Section IV.  
II. HOMOGENEOUS ALGORITHM FOR UPLINK SCHEDULING 
IN HYBRID ONU-BS ARCHITECTURE 
This section introduces the proposed hybrid ONU-BS 
architecture, QoS support mapping and selected 
representative homogeneous algorithm for uplink scheduling 
in hybrid ONU-BS architecture.  
A. Hybrid ONU-BS architecture  
The literature has proposed a wide range of integrated 
structure; nothing more than makes the EPON Ethernet 
frames encapsulated as 802.16 MAC PDUs or to adapt an 
802.16 network to run EPON MAC protocols. However, 
both of the above integrated architectures suffered a critical 
problem of physical unification because of they are not 
standardized till now. The hybrid FTTx - EPON and 
WiMAX network architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. In 
backhaul EPON network, a centralized OLT communicates 
are more delay tolerant but generally have a wide-band 
nature; however, the EF traffic is very delay-sensitive but 
tends to be a narrow-band nature. A fixed and properly-sized 
cycle length with fixed position of EF traffic can provide 
lower delay and jitter guarantee.  
3) Proposed QoS Mapping  
In order to provide guaranteed QoS for differentiated 
services, traffics should be allocated both for the service 
flows and the queues. Although the overall operational 
principles of the two types of networks are rather similar, 
particularly in the aspect of bandwidth request and allocation. 
WiMAX systems generally allocate bandwidth more finely 
than EPON systems. In addition, the connection-oriented 
bandwidth allocation generally shows a more predictable 
QoS than the queue-based bandwidth allocation, which 
implies that WiMAX technology is expected to support QoS 
better than EPON technology. In contrast, EPON technology 
shows better operational scalability than WiMAX 
technology as each ONU is required to manage only up to 
eight priority queues. Because EPON and WiMAX use 
different operational protocols in spite of similarity in their 
bandwidth request/grant mechanisms, it may make sense to 
modify the MAC layer protocols of EPON to also enable to 
support connection-oriented services as in WiMAX systems. 
Moreover, the bandwidth should be constrained by the 
mapping policy of QoS management. As shown in Figure 3, 
wired and wireless access networks share the queues in the 
EPON system. Eight queues make up a PON link and each 
service flow have their own queues. By service self-aware 
technology, the EPON system classifies the services to three 
types EF traffic, AF traffic and BE traffic. These services can 
be mapped to different queues and acquire different QoS. 
The Table I shows a proposed QoS mapping policy. 
C. Homogeneous Uplink Scheduling  
In hybrid ONU-BS architecture, all service flow share 
the same memory buffer of fixed size in ONU-BS for 
WiMAX and EPON traffic requirements. For a simple Strict 
Priority (SP) scheduling policy, the high priority packet can 
preempt the memory reserved for packets of lower priorities 
when the corresponding buffer is full. On the other hand, the 
lower-priority packet will be dropped when packet arrives 
and finds that the corresponding buffer is full. Therefore, in 
SP scheduling policy low-priority packets may get 
starvation when the proportion of high-priority traffic is 
high. For supporting QoS requirements, after the mapping 
configuration, scheduling policy and congestion control 
policy should be configured. This is conducted by the 
Admission Control module which only buffers admitted 
packets into ONU-BS queues. Admission control is one of 
the effective mechanisms to satisfy the demand for 
bandwidth request and enhance the efficiency of the system. 
Many admission control mechanisms can be found in the 
literature for both EPON [17] and WiMAX [18] but in 
integrated EPON and WiMAX architecture, however this 
issue will be considered in this paper, we do a 
Homogeneous Uplink Scheduling to discuss the starvation 
problem faced by low-priority service traffics, end to end 
delay and QoS support ability in HOA which is shown as 
Figure 3.

First in first out (FIFO) queuing is the most basic queue 
scheduling discipline. In FIFO queuing, all packets will be 
served by the coming time, is also referred to as first-come, 
and first served queuing. Priority queuing (PQ) is the basis 
for a class of queue scheduling algorithms that are designed 
to provide a relatively simple method of supporting 
differentiated service classes, which means that the ONU-BS 
serves a higher-priority queue to exhaustion before serving a 
lower-priority queue when a slot arrives. Weighted fair 
queuing (WFQ) is the basis for a class of queue scheduling 
disciplines that are designed to address limitations of the fair 
queuing, which means that the ONU-BS set differentiated 
weights to decide each available proportion of bandwidth by 
different priority traffic. The proposed Innovated Custom 
queuing (ICQ), which will meet the minimum delay of 
highest priority traffic but sacrificing the low priority traffic 
bandwidth requirements. The ICQ is constructed by one 
System Queue (SQ), for high priority traffic, and multi-
Custom Queue (CQ), which includes mediums and low 
priority traffic. Moreover, ICQ set up two levels of 
scheduling - in the first level, scheduling is constructed based 
on FIFO to collect differentiated class of traffic into different 
priority queue. In the second level, system queue has 
absolute priority so that the system always processes system 
queue first and then deals with CQ for DiffServ mechanism. 
Here, the main function of second level is WRR which is to 
allocate bandwidth according to the weight and queue length 
to decide the available bandwidth for multi-CQ.

performance on packet loss ratio. The reason is that the ICQ 
can be an efficient and flexible bandwidth distribution

IV. CONCLUSIONS  
As a cost-effective, bandwidth benefit, mobility, and 
scalable solution to the broadband access network, integrated 
of EPON and WiMAX architecture - hybrid ONU-BS 
architecture (HOA) have the capability to deliver integrated 
broadband services by efficient fixed mobile convergence. 
This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation 
of a number of algorithms for the uplink traffic in HOA 
networks. Existing proposals of scheduling schemes have 
been focus on homogenous categories; which include FIFO, 
PQ, WFQ and proposed Innovated Custom queuing (ICQ). 
Representative schemes from homogenous categories have 
been evaluated with respect to major distinguishing 
characteristics of the HOA. Based on the simulation results, 
we conclude that the ICQ scheduling scheme, minimum 
delay of highest priority traffic but sacrificing the low 
priority traffic bandwidth requirements, can provides the 
desired performance with respect to all the QoS requirements 
and characteristics of the HOA.
