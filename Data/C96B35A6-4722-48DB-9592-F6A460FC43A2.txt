can only deal with narrow band disturbance. To conquer the broad band vibration 
problem, the fluid engine mount is developed [1,2]. By appropriate designing, the fluid 
mount has better static rigidity and dynamic vibration isolation in the designed 
frequency range. However, adaptive abilities for passive mounts are generally poor. 
The variation of system parameters or non-designed vibration frequency applied can 
seriously affect the performance of vibration suppression. The adaptive ability of fluid 
mount can be improved by adding a hydraulic actuator. But, the complexity of the 
system grows while incorporating this device. Moreover, the closed loop stability is 
hard to guarantee. 
Recently, smart materials are developed rapidly. There are some well known 
smart materials appeared in the last decade, such as piezoelectric ceramics [3], 
magnetostrictive fluids [4], and electro-rheological fluids [5], etc. Actuators 
incorporating these materials have prominent potentials for vibration suppression, 
under complex and varied environment. The ER fluid is used here for constructing the 
engine mount. There are three kinds of ER mounts appeared in the literatures: flow 
mode, mixed mode and squeezed-flow mode [6,7]. This paper adopts a squeezed-flow 
mode ER engine mount for vibration suppression study. Mathematical model of ER 
engine mount can be found in [8]. The dynamic behavior of ER fluid is highly 
nonlinear; therefore, controller design is extremely difficult. Some control algorithms 
have been discussed in previous literatures neural network [9],  control [10], 
skyhook control [11] and optimal control [12,13] are examples. Nevertheless, the ER 
mount systems contain time varying parameters. Thus, closed loop stability is hard to 
guarantee by linear controller. Using robust control techniques may work for time 
varying parameters or disturbances, yet requiring that all uncertainties be defined in 
some compact sets. The neural network based controllers could deal with those time 
varying uncertainties effectively. However, the stability of overall system is difficult to 
obtain. 
∞H
In this paper, an adaptive sliding controller and function approximation technique 
are proposed to deal with modeling uncertainty and unknown disturbance [13-15]. 
Since the uncertainties are assumed to be time varying, function approximation 
technique may be used here to represent the unknown disturbances or uncertainties in 
some finite linear combinations of the orthogonal basis functions. By selecting 
appropriate update law, the time derivative of some Lyapunov function candidate can 
be proved to be negative semi-definite. Furthermore, not only the convergence of 
tracking error but also boundedness of all signals can be obtained. The paper is 
organized as follows. Section II gives a brief formulation of ER mount model and its 
properties. Section III derives the adaptive sliding control in detail. Section IV shows 
the simulation results of the proposed control law for vibration suppression of the one 
dimensional ER mount. Moreover, the well known skyhook control scheme and fixed 
maximum applied voltage control are to be compared with the proposed adaptive 
controller. Finally in Section V conclusions are briefly made.

CONTROLLER DESIGN

proof for stability analysis. The controller is designed in following steps.

where σ  is a small positive constant. 
Remark 3: The ER mount control is a semi-active one; therefore control action should 
follow the actuating condition [7].

SIMULATION RESULTS 
The system parameters used in the simulation are shown in Table 1 and n=21 
terms of Fourier orthogonal basis are used for function approximation. The sinusoidal 
disturbances y(t) with frequency between 10Hz~30Hz and amplitude at  are 
employed as the base excitation. The vibration control results are shown in Fig. 2-5. 
The comparison of the proposed control law and other control schemes is shown in Fig. 
2. Fig.3 shows the displacements of the bearing mass by each controller. From Figs. 
2-3, we can find that the proposed controller has much better performance for vibration 
attenuation than other controllers, even we do not know exactly the parameter values. 
The parameter estimation is shown in Fig. 4. Since reference input do not satisfy the 
persistent excitation condition; therefore, the estimation do not converge to actual 
value but it is bounded. Fig. 5 is the control voltage input to the electrodes.
