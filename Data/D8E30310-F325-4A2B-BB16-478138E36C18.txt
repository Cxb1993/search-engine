The pass-by noise generated by the 
vehicle is a typical engineering problem of 
moving sound source. S. F. Wu [12] used the 
extended Kirchhoff equation to investigate the 
variation of noise radiation when the vehicle 
motion was along a solid ground at constant 
speed. The result indicated that the effect of 
source convection motion enhanced sound 
radiation in the forward direction, but reduced 
that in the reward direction. Antes and Baaran 
[13] also researched the relative problem and 
further considered the conditions of the 
physical boundary existence. 
So far the study of the moving sound 
source, little attention has been given to the 
difference between stationary and moving 
sound source. Thus, the purpose of this 
research is to apply the theory of the moving 
sound source to investigate the difference of 
the sound pressure generated by a stationary or 
a moving sound source in time domain. For 
accomplishing the quantitative analysis of 
sound pressure distribution, a numerical 
calculation procedure is established by using 
time-domain acoustic analogy and boundary 
element method (BEM).

The term ρ  in Eq. (1) is the density of 
fluid field and 0ρ  is the mean density. Thus, ( )0ρρ−  represents the density fluctuation. The 
0c  in Eq. (1) is the sound speed in the 
undisturbed medium and ( ) ijijij ppP σδ −−= 0  
is the so-called compressive stress tensor 
where ijδ  is Kronecker delta and ijσ  is 
viscous stress tensor, p  and 0p  are the 
pressure of fluid field and the mean pressure 
respectively, therefore, ( )0pp −  represents 
the pressure fluctuation. It is worth noting that, 
if the fluid property is inviscid flows to be 
considered, and then compressive stress tensor 
can be reduced to ( ) ijpp δ0− . Furthermore, the 
term ijP  is equal to ( )txp ,v  when the viscous 
property of the fluid doesn’t consider. 
The R.H.S. of Eq. (1) can be divided into 
two kinds of term, i.e., the monopole relational 
term ( ) t∂∂ ...  and the dipole relational term 
( ) ix∂∂ ... . After using the procedure of the 
solving the nonhomogenous wave equation 
and being replaced with the monopole 
relational term tQ ∂∂  (same as the dipole 
relational term ixQ ∂∂  )of Eq.(1). The 
solution of the Eq. (1) can be expressed as

represented as the Mach number ( M ). If the 
sound source is stationary, the term M  is 
equal to zero. In addition, the fluid media used 
in this example are: sound speed smc 3400 =  
and fluid density 30 mkg1.225=ρ . For 
establishing the numerical model, the surface 
of the pulsating sphere is discretized into 96 
linear quadrilateral elements with 98 nodes 
and this numerical model is shown in Fig.(3). 
Fig.(4-5) show the observer’s sound 
pressure in time domain and spectrograms 
respectively at f =54.113Hz. Fig.(6-7) show 
the different results when exciting frequency is 
equal to f =108.226Hz. 
Comparing with Fig.(4) and Fig.(6), the 
waveform of the sound pressure isn’t 
variational in time domain when the exciting 
frequency changes. However, the waveforms 
of the sound pressure distortions obviously to 
contrast the sound generated by the stationary 
source ( 0.0=M ) and the moving source 
( 0.0≠M ). In the stationary condition, the 
distribution of sound pressure is regular, i.e; 
the average value of the pressure peak is equal 
to the maximum value. In the moving 
condition, the amplitude of the pressure 
increases gradually when the source approach 
to the observer and decreases when the source 
leaves from the observer. In addition, the 
sound pressure enhances more clearly when 
the moving speed increases. 
Comparing with Fig.(5) and Fig.(7), the 
peak line is horizontal and corresponds to it 
exciting frequency in the stationary condition. 
In the moving condition, the peak line is 
distorted. These figures indicate that the peak 
line is increased when the source approaches 
to the observer and decreased when the source 
leaving from the observer. The line width that 
is located at the position between increased 
and decreased line segment becomes broader 
when the moving speed of the sound source 
increases. Obviously, the variation of the 
sound pressure is entirely different no matter 
time domain or spectrogram’s results. 
3.2 Case B: Two Moving Pulsating Spheres  
Fig.(2) shows two pulsating sphere move 
rectilinearly at the same constant subsonic 
speed and vibration frequency in free space. In 
this sound field, there are two observers fixed 
along the path of the moving sound source. In 
the stationary condition, the value of the 
observer’s sound pressure at 1fp  is smaller 
than 2fp ; in the moving condition, the value of 
the observer’s sound pressure at 1fp  is equal 
to 2fp . Thus, the sound pressure variation at 
2fp  is chose to examine in this case. 
Fig.(8) and Fig.(10) show the observer’s 
sound pressure in time domain at 
f =54.113Hz and f =108.226Hz respectively. 
In the stationary condition, the distribution of 
sound pressure is still to keep regular. In the 
moving condition, it is different from case A 
that more than one obvious pressure peaks 
generate. To examine the moving condition 
further, there have two conspicuous peaks in 
the sound pressure distribution and the first 
peak value is bigger than second peak. The 
reason is that the first peak value generated in 
the situation of both sound sources 
approaching the observer and the second peak 
value generated in the situation of the 
backward sound sources approaching the 
observer but forward sound sources leaving. 
Fig.(9) and Fig.(11) show the observer’s 
sound pressure in spectrograms at 
f =54.113Hz and f =108.226Hz respectively. 
In the stationary condition, although the 
number of the sound source is increased, the 
shape of the peak line doesn’t have any 
variation to correspond to Fig.(5) and Fig.(7). 
The only different is the peak value bigger 
than the stationary condition in case A. 
In the moving condition, not only the 
peak line is distorted but also the numbers of 
the peak line is doubled. Obviously, the 
numbers of the moving sound sources can be 
identified in the spectrogram. 
Table (1-4) illustrate the maximum value 
of the sound pressure for the case A and case B. 
During these tables, the first columns give the 
sound pressure level (SPL) and the second 
columns give the A-weighted sound level 
(A-SL). A-SL consider to the sensitivity if the 
ear at that frequency. Table (5) gives the 
corrections to be added to octave-band levels 
to convert to A-weighted band levels. 
These Tables indicate that the sound 
pressure is proportional to the moving speed, 
the numbers of the sound source and the
