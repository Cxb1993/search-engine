2. Materials and Methods 
The micro-grooves on silicone wafers were fabricated by photolithographic 
techniques [2]. Then, silicon wafers were cleaned ultrasonically in acetone solution, then 
continued by immersing wafers in piranha solution (7/3 (v/v) of 98% H2SO4 / 30% H2O2). 
After that, the wafers were copiously rinsed with DI water, PBS, and sterilized under UV 
light. osteoblasts were cultured on the treated silicone wafer supplied with MEM, 
incubated at 37oC, and 5% CO2. With various culture times, the cells cultured on silicone 
wafers were fixed, dehydrated, and observed under SEM or light microscope. For the 
idenfication of cellular mineralization, the von Kossa staining [3] and ESCA were applied 
on osteoblasts on silicone wafers after the culture with mineralization -induced medium 
[3]. 
  AFM experiments were performed with a Nanoscope III and all the data was measured 
by a J scanner (maximum XY scan range of 125 * 125 µm with vertical Z range of 5 µm). 
The experiments were performed in air at a constant temperature of 20°C, and relative 
humidity below 40%. The tip was made to approach the cell layer at a constant speed of 1 
µm/s. 
This cantilever was modified by osteoblast with manipulator after gelatin was 
deposited on the end of cantilever. Thus, the cultured osteoblast was attached to the 
designed place on AFM cantilever. The modified cantilever was then inserted in the AFM 
to measure the force-distance curve, where the substrate was the surfaces with different 
topography prepared by lithography process. By monitoring the deflection of the 
cantilever, a force-distance curve was obtained and the adhesion force evaluated by 
Hook’s law, ZkF ∆×= , where k is the spring constant and ΔZ is the deflection of the 
cantilever. The deflection, ΔZ, was defined as the lowest point on the force-distance 
curve. This definition was consistent with methods in previous research [4]. In Fig. 1, Δ
Z is marked by a dashed line.

contrary, the ratios for cells cultured on smooth PDMS were all close to 1 in 24-hour 
culture, demonstrating there was almost no elongation of osteoblasts on smooth surfaces. 
It is clear that the cell elongation significantly increases when the groove width decreases. 
The cells exposed the highest elongation on narrowest groove pattern (1-2 µm). On 
smooth surface, the cells had the spindle-like shape, just like their native shape, resulting 
in the cell elongation was just a little bit higher than 1. The above observations generally 
indicates that microgroove pattern on PDMS can induce the elongation of osteoblasts. In 
addition, the higher degree of elongation was found on the cells cultured on narrower 
grooves. 
 The alignment of osteoblasts was evaluated by calculating the percentage of aligned 
cells. The cell is considered as an “aligned” cell when the angle between cell major axis 
relative to the groove direction is smaller than 100. Fig.6 interprets the degree of cell 
orientation on surfaces with different groove widths. The smooth surface is not mentioned 
in this analysis because the cells locating on smooth surface expressed random orientation 
only. From Fig.6, groove patterns of PDMS substrate cause the alignment of osteoblasts 
and are able to direct the cell orientation. The decrease of groove width results in the 
enhancement of cell alignment. Thus, when the groove width ranges from 12 µm, the cells 
achieve the highest alignment. However, the guidance effect of groove pattern of PDMS 
varied with the culture time and was with the clearest appearance at 8th hour of incubation. 
At 12th hour culture, the cell alignment on 2-6 µm grooved surface was similar to those on 
6-13 µm and 13-20 µm. That probably resulted from the influence of cell aggregation on 
those grooved surfaces. With a lot of cell aggregations, the cells would bridge over 
grooves easily and would not be restricted by topography anymore. 
The spreading of osteoblasts on grooved PDMS was measured and presented in Fig. 
7. Compared with cells on flat surfaces, the cells on groove patterns appeared in smaller 
spreading area. Moreover, the cell spreading would obviously decrease with the decrease 
of groove size. The smallest cells always located on the narrowest groove (1-2 µm). These 
results proved that the groove pattern of PDMS significantly obstructed the cell spreading, 
which supports the results on pristine PDMS. It reveals that for osteoblasts, although the 
increase in PDMS hydrophilicity successfully promote the cell spreading, the hindrance 
on cell spreading caused by grooved topography would still exist. 
To analyze the phenotype of cultured osteoblasts, the mineralization marker, calcium 
deposition caused by cultured osteoblastic cells, was evaluated by using ESCA. From the 
values of Ca/C shown in Fig. 8, the decrease in groove width clearly increased the number 
of calcium nodules on the silicone wafer; that is, the phenotypes of osteoblastic cells 
would be promoted by the micro-grooves. Besides, the promotion would be stronger with 
the groove with smaller width.

marker CD34 [11]. In contrast, two kinds of stem cell expressed strong positive signal of 
CD44. In a research of Shi and co-workers, it was revealed that not only DPSCs and 
BMSCs but also stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) and 
periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSC) exhibited negative signal for CD34 and positive 
signal for CD44 [12].

二、 與會心得 
在本次會議中，明顯可見材料在未來應用與發展的兩大主軸：生醫與奈米。以主辦單位
新加坡大學而言，其化工系更已更名為化工與生物科技學系，指出此一趨勢已銳不可擋。就
申請人主要參加的討論會 A（Advanced Functional Biomaterials）與 C （Bio Functional 
Materials: From Understanding to Design）而言，多數研究集中在藥物釋放、基因治療與組織
工程方面。在藥物釋放與基因工程方面，較受廣泛注意與討論的研究為奈米粒子的應用與靶
向投藥技術的發展，會議中提出了多種奈米粒子的製備方法，並可有效將高分子奈米粒子的
大小降低至數十奈米左右，證實可將所攜帶之藥物成功穿過血腦屏障，用於基因轉殖或基因
治療，其基因表現能力明顯提高，而在載體表免施以特殊抗體的固定化，可賦予釋藥粒子相
當之專一性，增加了藥物的治療效果也降低了可能的副作用。在組織工程方面，較受注意的
研究包括以下兩者，一是利用中空纖維管狀膜製備生物反應器，可大幅縮短組織培養所需要
的時間，另一則是利用薄膜製備對細胞代謝廢物與分泌物的感測器，可以更精準地控制細胞
發育的情形。
