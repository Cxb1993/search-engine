擁有庫存區串聯等候線系統之分析:使用階段型分佈之方法 
Analysis of tandem queues with inventory: a phase-type distribution approach 
中文摘要 
串聯等候線因其可以描述現實生活中許多系統如流線型生產線、銀行服務作業而廣泛被
討論。在本計劃中我們考慮一個串聯等候線系統其中在每站後會有庫存區同時會有兩種顧客:
一種可等與另一種必須立刻得到庫存品。此系統可在一拉式(pull)生產系統觀察到。該系統生
產完成品供應簽約顧客(contracted customers)與一般顧客。當簽約顧客有需求時必須立刻供貨
而一般顧客則可以等。為了滿足簽約顧客與降低一般顧客的等待時間，生產線會預先準備一
些成完品(base stock)，但因同時要考慮限制在生產線上之半成品(work in process, WIP)數量，
所以會採用拉式生產，亦即來一個顧客再生產新的產品。 對於簽約顧客我們以他們到達時可
以直接被庫存滿足的機率(fill rate)最為服務指標；對於一般顧客我們以他們在他們可容許的
等待時間內會獲得成完品的機率(on-time delivery rate)為服務指標。如何在要求服務指標下決
定預先準備一些成完品的數量則是管理階層所關心的重要課題。 
串聯等候線能被確切分析的只在於簡單的系統。其他分析方法則包含諸如利用模擬與近
似解的方法。近似解的想法之一是將串聯等候線中的每一站看成是階段性分佈(phase-type 
distribution)中的一個階段(phase)，利用階段性分佈估計顧客的等候時間，再利用連續階段性
與離散階段性分佈的關連性進一步求出在系統顧客人數的分佈。然而庫存區與加入考量不能
等之顧客將增加分析之困難度。在本計劃中，我們以階段性分佈之方法分析我們的系統。我
們定義新的階段性矩陣(phase-type transition rate matrix)與估計有效到達率(effective arrival 
rate)與一般顧客之等候時間並進一步近似簽約顧客到達時可以直接被庫存滿足的機率與一般
顧客在他們可容許的等待時間內會獲得成完品的機率兩個服務指標。由數值範例的分析，我
們的近似解與模擬的結果接近。 我們的方法也可提供業界一種以量化庫存管理的工具。

一、 報告內容 
1. Introduction 
Tandem queues induce great interests from researches since they can represent a numerous 
real-world systems. In a tandem queues, an arrival goes through all the station from the first to the 
last to have his service done. In such queueing systems the departure process from one station forms 
the arrival process to the next station.  We use tandem queues to model flow-line production 
system, clinical physical exam, computer communication for packages or loan approval process in a 
bank and et al. There also come with different variants of classical tandem queues seen in the 
real-world.  For example, in the loan approval process or similar approval process such as credit 
card application approval process, batch processing are considered in the classical tandem queues; 
For the physical exam, patients may be lead to next available exam station; in communication 
system, some packages may be lost during the communications due to the lack of bandwidth; in the 
flow-line production system, there may have some safety stock initially at the end of the line. 
The exact analysis is restricted to some simple tandem queues systems. Taking a two-station 
tandem queues as an example, till now, we still cannot derive the exact probability distribution 
function (p.d.f.) of waiting time in system at the second station unless the inter-arrival and service 
times at the first station are exponential.  The difficulty for analyzing the classical tandem queues 
lies mainly on the fact that the departure process from the first station is still a Poisson process only 
if the first queue is a M/M/1 system. Not to mention the difficulty in analysis the waiting time in 
system for the multi-station tandem queues and their variants.   
The alternative attempts for the analysis of a tandem queueing system include the simulation and 
approximation methods. For the method of approximations, Jun and Perros[5] further classified the 
approximation procedures that have been developed for tandem queueing systems into two 
categories: decomposition of individual queues and analysis of successive pairs of adjacent queues.  
For the decomposition, the tandem queueing system is decomposed into individual station with 
modified service time and Poisson arrival process. Each station is then analyzed individually by 
using approximate solutions.  One of the approximations is to describe the stations of the system 
6 
 
customers, such as the contracted customers, upon their arrivals; In a cellular phone network, an 
active call (called hand-on call) of a cellular phone moves from the covering area from current cell 
to the next. The next cell must provide bandwidth for it when it moves into, otherwise this call will 
be dropped. However, a call from a local cellular phone may be scheduled to wait for the bandwidth 
when it is trying to make a call.  The hand-on calls are the no-wait customers to the new cell. In 
general, the management of these systems with two kinds of customers is focusing on reducing the 
lead time (waiting time in system) of general customers and the loss rate of the no-wait customers.  
In this project, we consider a system that there are two kinds of customers in this tandem queues 
with inventory: one can't wait, called the no-wait customers, while the other can, called the general 
customers.  Taking the production system as an example, we consider the tandem queues with 
finished goods inventory and there are two kinds of customers, the no-wait and the general one. 
Both will take one finished goods upon their arrivals, however, the no-wait customers will leave if 
they can’t have the finished goods immediately but the general customers will wait. In this system, 
the arrival rate of the system at first station is the sum of effective arrival rate of the no-wait 
demands and the arrival rate of the general customers. It is hard to have exact analysis for the 
tandem queues with inventory, even for the Markovian system. Chang and Lu[2] and Chang and 
Lu[3] considered a two-station tandem queues with no-wait customers and general customers. In 
Chang and Lu[2] the second station is approximated by a G/M/1 queue and in Chang and Lu[3] the 
system is analyzed by a QBD(quasi birth and death) process, based on which, the stead-state 
probabilities are approximated( by the method of matrix of geometric) and so is the effective arrival 
rate. The waiting time in system is then approximated by using PASTA properties. Although in 
both papers the approximations are accurate, however, their methods are hard to extend for the 
multi-station system. In this project, we extend the system studied in Lee and Zipkin[6] by 
considering the no-wait demands additionally. In our system, the effective arrival rate of no-wait 
customers will depend on the states of the inventory (they can obtain service only if the inventory is 
not empty), which will also depend on the effective arrival rate itself. Inventory accompanied with 
the no-wait demands will make our analysis more complicated. In this project we extend the 
phase-type distribution approximation by Lee and Zipkin[6], which is dealing with only the general 
customers, to approximate the effective arrival rate of no-wait customers and the waiting time in 
system of the general customers in our system. 
2.  Phase-Type Distribution 
Consider a CTMC(continuous time Markov Chain) ( ){ }0ttX ≥, . Let ijq  be the transition rate 
from i  to j and ∑= k jkj qυ  and Q be the transition rate matrix that

In this case, we say that L  has continuous phase type distribution ( )Q,αCPH , where 
( )0P=α . During time L , the number of independent Poisson arrivals with rate λ  arrive to the 
system, denoted by K , is then has a discrete phase type distribution(see Neuts[7] ), ( )Ppi,DPH , 
where Ppi α=  and ( ) 1−−= QIλλP  and I  is an identity matrix. Therefore,

3.  Model descriptions 
We consider a serial production system of J stations with random ordinary and general 
customers (see Fig. 1). Station J is a station dedicated for special product by general customers by 
perform additional works on the standard products done at station J − 1. Initially, there are already 
some finished standard products(called base stock) prepared in the stock. The production of the 
finished standard products is controlled by base-stock policy in the following manner: when an 
ordinary demand arrives, if there are standard products in the stock she will take one of them and 
leave, otherwise, her order will be lost. Every satisfied ordinary demand will send a production 
order to trigger the production of a new standard product to keep the base stock level. When a 
general customer arrives, she will take one standard product from the stock if the stock is not empty, 
otherwise, she will wait for the next available standard product on the basis of 
first-come-first-served. This standard product will then be carried to Station J for further required 
processing. Every arriving general customer will also trigger the production of a standard product. 
We assume that the ordinary demands arrive at stations J − 1 for acquiring standard products 
according to a Poisson processes with rate λ and that general customers arrive at station J 
according to a Poisson with rate λ . The production time of station j  is assumed to be 
exponentially distributed with respective rate µ  for j = 1,… ,	J ; Let Bj  be the number of 
backorders at the end of station j for j=1, …, J;  be the number of production order in station 
j	(waiting or under processing) for j = 1,… ,	J; There is only an inventory for finished standard 
products at the end of station J − 1, called IJ. Let SJ be the base-stock level for the finished 
standard products at station J − 1	. Buzacott et al. [1] and Lee and Zipkin[10] have studied a serial 
production system with inventory at each station for MTS demands. Buzacott et al. [1] use 
recursive equations to study the system, while Lee and Zipkin[10] use phase-type distribution 
approximation. We use phase-type approximation to study the system with two kinds of demands.

where	vj = (µj − λ). 
 
Let K be the number of units that must continue to be produced at station j in order to meet 
demand; that is, Kj = Bj + Nj,	j = 2,⋯ ,	J		where	K = N. K then has the same distribution as 
the number of demands arrive in Lj. Kj has a discrete phase-type distribution with parameters 
(pij,Pj) where pij = γjPj according to Neuts [7]. Then 
P	Kj > k

where e is the corresponding column vector of ones. 
 Note that an ordinary demand will receive the finished standard product if there is some 
inventory (IJ > 0). Also note that there is no inventory (IJ = 0) if and only if KJ ≥ SJ. 
Therefore, an ordinary demand will obtain the finished standard product with probability 
1 − PKJ ≥ SJ, and a production order will enter the first station of the system. However, the 
distribution of KJ  will also depend on the effective arrival rates of ordinary and general 
customers, respectively. 
We assume a Markovian system of Poisson arrivals with rate λ and exponential service times 
with rate µj at station  j,		j = 1,⋯ ,	J − 1. Let ρ be the actual probability that there are no 
finished standard products in IJ. Let λe be the actual effective arrival rate of ordinary demands. 
Note that according to the PASTA property, λe is given by 
                        λe = λ	1 − ρ
.        (6) 
 The following are our approximation method for obtaining the estimation of λe; (∙) indicates 
the number of iterations. 
Step 1. Let λe() = λ . We obtain the steady-state probability under λ()  that there are no 
finished standard products in IJ, p

 For obtaining OTDR for general customers. Define Rj be the waiting time of a demand at 
station j. Note that Bj has the same distribution as the number of demands in Rj. The distribution 
of Rj can be expressed as follows. Let I denote an identity matrix and  denote a column vector 
of ones, Sj = 0, and j = 1,… ,	J − 2

 When products BJ > 	0 , then IJ = 0.  This indicates station J − 1  has no finished 
standard products in hand to satisfy ordinary demands. Thus, ordinary 
demands will be lost if they arrive at the system. The system will give priority to provide finished 
standard products for backorders for the general customers waiting at BJ. 
 Note that backorders at station J − 	1 is from backorders for general customers alone. We 
start by successively adding the LNJ to that of the preceding station j(	j = J − 2,	J − 3,… ,1) in 
sequence until the sum is greater than the expected value of backorders waiting at BJ . That is, 
we start from station J − 1 and successively add the expected value of production orders at each 
preceding station j∗ until for the first j∗ that LNJ + LNJ +⋯+ LNJ∗ ≥ LBJ.  
   This assumption indicates that the cumulative sum of the expected values of the production 
orders from station j to station J − 1 is the supply for backorders at BJ. In addition, station J 
only provides products for general customers. Therefore, the waiting time between station j to 
station J  is exponentially distributed with a rate of µj − λ . As a result, an appropriate 
modification of matrix  is shown below:

Next, let us consider the case of four stations to explore the influence of production sequence 
on λ for ordinary demands, OTDR for general customers, and the corresponding queue length at 
each station. Let λ1 = 5, λ2 = 2.5 and u = 0.4. The service rates of the production sequences are 
	µ1 = 10,  µ2 = 9, "

 = 9, µ4 = 10
, respectively. We find that different production sequences do not affect !	. 
This is because the average total production time for finished standard products is the same, that is,

  (according to Little's law) and it does not increase or decrease as a result of different 
production sequences. Although OTDR is slightly affected by production sequence, the errors are 
within 5% relative to the simulated results. These results are shown in Table 2.

Track: Supply Chain Management and Managing International Operations 
 
Summary 
  We consider a lean supply-chain system in which there is a main production line accompanied 
with branch lines from suppliers producing needed parts. Main production line adopts 
build-to-order(BTO) production, however, suppliers adopt make-to-stock production. We study 
the distribution of response time of a demand by considering the system as a queueing network 
and applying phase-type distribution approximation. On-time-delivery rate can further be 
estimated. Our estimations can provide a useful insight to the management to evaluate or design 
the corresponding supply chain.  
Keywords: Lean production, queueing network, phase-type approximation 
 
Introduction  
In a lean system, we start to produce a product only when we receive a request(pull system); 
we prepare minimum level or zero of inventories and we manage to achieve on time delivery. 
Motivated the real case such as car assembly, we consider a system in which the main 
production line is a pull BTO production. It starts to produce a product only when it received the 
request. There are no inventories of finished products.  To accelerate the delivery, at each 
station initially some inventory of semi-finished products, called base stocks, will be prepared 
and the production is controlled by base-stock control policy. Under the base-stock control 
policy, an arriving request will take a finished-product from inventory or wait for another one if 
there are none in inventory. In either case, a production order for producing a new product will 
be released to this station upon the arrival of this request. The production order will acquire a 
finished semi-product from the precedent station and it is the request to the precedent station. 
However, this request will also release a production to current station and it will be a request to 
the precedent of the current station. Therefore, when a request arrives to this main production 
line, there are production orders released to each station simultaneously.   
In addition to the main production line, there is a supplier provides parts to each station.  
Suppliers of parts also utilize pull production with base-stock control policy. At each station, the 
production order will first wait for the finished semi-product from the precedent station, then 
wait for the part delivered from the supplier of this and then wait for the processing at work 
station.  
The time when a request arrives till this request is satisfied by having a finished product is 
called the response time of this request. Usually there is a requirement on the response time. For 
example, when a request for custom laptop computer arrives, it will be required that the laptop 
has to be shipped in 20 hours.  This means that the response time has to be less than 20 hours. 
In this paper, the percentage of requests whose response times are less than the requirement is 
similar system. They estimate the probability of the number of the backorders and the expected 
WIPs and further to study the optimization problem with minimum cost. Beside the articles 
focus on queueing analysis, Ettl et al.[6] formulated a constrained nonlinear optimization 
problem, which minimizes the total average dollar value of inventory in a supply-chain network 
subjected to meeting the service-level requirements of end customers. Gunasekaran and Ngai[8] 
provided a throughout survey on modeling and analysis of the 
MTO(make-to-order)/BTO(build-to-order) supply chain systems based on the method of 
operations research.  
Since the distinct structure of the fork-join queue(FJQ), the analysis of the FJQ is difficult. 
Most the articles are studying the approximations or the bounds. Raghavan and 
Viswanadham[17] used FJQ to represent a supply chain networks(SCN) and provided a survey 
on the related papers. Kim and Agrawala [11] studied the waiting time in a two-station FJQ and 
mentioned that only the closed form solution can only be obtained for a very few FJQs. Flatto 
and Hahn[7] provided a better solution for a FJQ with only two parallel queues. Kumar and 
Shorey[13] studied a Fork-join communication queueing network and obtained an analytical 
bound on the mean response time. Varki and Dowdy[20] analyzed the expected lead time of a 
production order in a FJQ. Balsamo and Mura[2] utilized two Markovian queueing networks to 
approximate the FJQ, based on which, they obtained upper and lower bounds for the response 
time. Ray[18] used a mix of analytical method and simulation to calculate the average response 
time of a FJQ with general arrival process. Varki [20] also used simulation to calculate average 
response time of a FJQ with Erlang and hyper-exponential service time. Hemachandra and 
Eedupugnti[9] studied the throughput, mean response time, expected WIP and the corresponding 
optimization problem. Ko and Serfozo[12] considered the response time of a FJQ with M/M/S 
stations. They studied the stability conditions and the bounds on the expected response time. 
Avsar and Zijm [1] considered converting an original two-parallel-node FJQ into an alternative 
semi-parallel queueing system and proved that these two systems are equivalent based on sample 
path analysis. They then used product form steady-state probability obtained from the 
Markovian system of the alternative system to study the corresponding performances. Since the 
inherent difficulty in analysis, much of works were still focusing on FJQ station, phase-type 
approach can be a new way to explore the FJQ network further.  
 
Model description and phase-type approximation 
In the main production line, there are 3 queues and 2 inventory queues associated with this 
station: the queue of outstanding(waiting) requests, the queue of the production orders, the queue 
of the merged production orders which are production orders with parts waiting for the work of 
this station, the inventory of finished semi-products and the inventory of the parts. The last 
station in the main production line has no inventories of the finished products.  We consider a 
lean production system with station 1,2,…,J. For station j, the queue for the outstanding requests 
is denoted by JjB j ,...,2,1, = , the queue of production orders is denoted by JjN j ,...,2,1, = , the

denoted by JjPj ,...2,1, = . For station j  in the main production line, Fig. 1 describes the

In summary, the main characteristics of our underlying queueing network system are 
three-fold: Pull/base stock, fork-join and phase-type service time. 
 In this study we consider a lean production system in which there are no inventories either 
for finished products or finished semi-products in main production line (see Fig. 4).  
 
Fig .4 Lean queueing network 
 
The service time at the station in the main production line is of phase-type distribution. Since 
there are no finished products or semi-products, the finished product acquired by the request has 
to start from the station 1.  Therefore, the response time of an arriving request is equal to the 
lead time of the production order released by it. At station j , when a production order has 
obtained a finished semi-product from up-stream station (j-1), it will wait for a part needed for 
station j. Since it is acquiring a finished part from branch line j , it is a request to the branch line 
and it need a response time to have the part, then it will waiting for the processing of the work 
station.  Therefore, the lead time of a production order at station j will be the sum of the 
response time of a station-( 1−j ) product, the response time for a station-j part and the waiting 
time in system of work station j.  
The main topics in defining the phase-type distribution are to identify the transition matrix and 
the corresponding initial probability. Define continuous phase-type distribution by  
with initial probability  and discrete phase-type distribution by  with initial 
probability π . If random variable X  is of  then  ; if Y  is of 
 , then , where  is a column of 1s. 
Suppose there are J stations in main production line.  Station j is of phase-type service time 
with  phases with service rate  at the kth phase, . For station j , the 
corresponding branch line j  has stations Jj . The service rate of the ith station in the branch line 
is . Suppose there are inventories of finished products at the end of  the main

Example 
Consider a lean system containing two stations shown in Fig 5.  The service time in the first 
station is of phase type with 21 =M  and the second one is of one phase.  The service rates for 
the each phase are 11µ and 12µ , respectively. The second station has service rate 2µ . The branch 
line of station 1 has three stations ( 31 =J ) have service rate 11ω , 12ω  and 13ω , respectively. The 
base stock level of the finished part of branch line 1 is 13S ; the branch line of station 2 has two 
stations ( 22 =J ) have service rate 21ω  and  22ω  , respectively. The base stock level of the 
finished part of branch line 2 is 22S  .  The arrival rate of the request for the finished product of 
the main production line is λ . The base stock level of the finished product is 2S .

The response time of the request to branch line 1 is of CPH( 13S1313 13 CP ,γ );the response time of 
the request to branch line 2 is of CPH( 22S2222 ,22 CPγ ), where
