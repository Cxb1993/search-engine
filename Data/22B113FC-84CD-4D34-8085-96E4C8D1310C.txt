1. Introduction 
With advanced network technology, people can share digital media information through 
Internet, in which vehicular networks are respected to be well developed in the future. Through 
vehicular networks, vehicles can exchange real time information to avoid accidents, and transmit 
digital media with P2P technique. In the present, many researches focus on vehicular packet 
transmission and clustering to improve the efficiency of the overall system. 
In future vehicular networks, the requirements of the communication between the vehicles 
and outside world will increase. Communication modules are expected to be embedded in 
vehicular entertainment system, which integrates Microsoft Silverlight streaming technique and 
Microsoft Expression Encoder to make Smooth Streaming effect and provide users a high-quality 
viewing experience. 
As shown in Fig. 1, vehicular wireless network access techniques can be classified into two 
types, including Vehicle to Roadside (V2R) and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) Communications 
[1][2][3]. Since all vehicular applications must be able to support high-speed mobility, Intelligent 
Transportation System (ITS) [4][5] is often adopted to provide drivers information and maintain 
connections among vehicles and roadside unit (RSU). The communication protocol that is used as 
a standard to support wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE) was defined by ITS IEEE 
802.11p Task Group recently [6][7][8].

Streaming because web server conforms to HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The advantage 
of this type is that it uses the traditional Web server, and it is therefore called Serverless Streaming 
or Pseudo Streaming. Before using HTTP streaming, multimedia files must be packed into a 
specific format like Real Media Format (.rm) or Advanced Streaming Format (.asf). Different 
bandwidth options for the multimedia data are required to fit current network conditions, but it 
wastes space of the server hard disk. 
The second type is to play multimedia files via independent streaming server [10] [11], which 
is usually named True Streaming. Because True Streaming conforms to Real Time Protocol (RTP), 
it is also called RTP Streaming. RTP, which is designed for real time streaming and similar with 
HTTP and FTP, sends a unidirectional data stream to players, and the data will be played right 
away if the bandwidth is enough. The data will be deleted after they are played, so there will not 
be any files saved in user’s hard disk. The transmission layer of RTP is User Data Protocol (UDP) 
rather than TCP. UDP transmits data faster, but it lacks for a response mechanism, and this may 
cause data loss. In addition, users cannot receive stream data via UDP in the firewall. To use RTP 
in firewall, HTTP tunneling technique that can pack RTP packets within HTTP packets to pass 
through the firewall is necessary. However, HTTP tunneling occupies more bandwidth since it 
needs plenty of extra data. 
The third streaming type is Clientless Streaming. With this streaming type, users play stream 
files with Java player, which was not built in client-side originally. Thus, Java player will be 
delivered to the client only when it is needed. The ultimate goal of streaming technique is 
“Streaming media at anywhere, anytime, anyplace and any device”. However, transmission 
bandwidth changes in some environments, and causes failure in transmission or waste of 
bandwidth. One possible solution is to change transmission modes. For example, P2P technique 
[12][13][14] can be used to make all peers share information on an equal basis to achieve the best 
 8
the same time, so how to allocate bandwidth to the receivers effectively becomes an important 
issue. A common scheme for solving this problem is to transmit the streaming data with different 
compression ratios or adjustable byte stream. However, this solution cannot guarantee the best 
QoS, but it is able to enhance overall effectiveness of the system. 
 
Fig. 3. Streaming architecture of one transmitter and multiple receivers. 
However, the types of multimedia streaming techniques mentioned above were designed for 
traditional Internet. To make users receive multimedia data anywhere, many researches have been 
working on supporting mobility for streaming. Nasser et al. [15] adaptively compressed 
multimedia data to fit different multimedia wireless network conditions. Thus, more new users can 
be allowed to receive the services. If free bandwidth cannot support new users’ requirements, call 
admission control (CAC) is used to drop the new requests. This research can maximize bandwidth 
utilization and provide users service with acceptable quality, but it is only designed for 
low-mobility devices. In the vehicular network environment, various traffic conditions and the 
clients’ fast moving make multimedia transmission more complicated. Yoon et al. [16] proposed a 
mobility profile aided file downloading service (MoPADS) for vehicular networks. MoPADS uses

In this work, an adaptive seamless streaming dissemination system is proposed to tackle 
above-mentioned challenges. The adaptive streaming system computes the parts of prefetched 
stream data for each user and stores them temporarily at the local server, based on current situation 
of the users and the environments that they are located at. Several techniques such as stream data 
prefetching, stream data forwarding, and adaptive dynamic decoding, were utilized for enhancing 
the adaptability of different users and environments and achieving the best transmission efficiency. 
Considering the uneven deployment of roadside base station (BS) and vehicles, the bandwidth 
reservation mechanism for premium user was proposed to ensure the QoS of stream data premium 
user received. Notably, fuzzy logic inference systems are utilized to determine if a BS or a vehicle 
can be chosen to transfer stream data for users. 
This article is organized as follows. The next section presents the multimedia streaming 
system. The simulation results are given in Section 3, and the final section concludes the work. 
2. An adaptive multimedia streaming dissemination system for vehicular networks 
The scenario of the proposed multimedia streaming dissemination system is illustrated in Fig. 
4. Video-on-demand (VoD) streaming dissemination server collects video and streaming data 
buffers are distributed at each local server. According to individual user’s current status, the VoD 
streaming dissemination server determines the amount of frames that each local server needs to 
prefetch and then saves data in the local server so that congestion can be effectively avoided.

they do not need to pre-load the stream data in advance. Although there are few roadside BSs in 
Case 2, the user can still receive the stream data via other vehicles as forwarding nodes. When the 
number of vehicles and roadside BSs is not enough to maintain the live streaming service, a 
pre-loading mechanism will be used to make sure that the users, especially the premium users, can 
still enjoy high viewing quality. The user will keep receiving the pre-loaded stream data until it 
leaves the range of the current BS, and then plays the pre-loaded stream data to meet a seamless 
live stream service. When the user enters into the range of another roadside BS, the user will start 
receiving the stream data from the BS again. The above-mentioned operations of the server are 
shown on the right part of Fig. 5. 
 Case 1: The density of roadside BSs and vehicle distribution are both high 
We can expect that the vehicle density and roadside BS distribution are both higher in 
populated urban areas. Although the number of roadside BSs here is much higher than that in 
suburbs or the normal roads, the users accessing the Internet also increase at the same time and it 
may cause the shortage of bandwidth and congestion. Therefore, in this case, we have to consider 
that the BSs have the possibility of unconnected status. Here we classify users into two types, 
including a premium user and a free user. In case of the shortage of the bandwidth, the free user 
will be degraded the quality of the streaming data to obtain more bandwidth to meet the minimum 
bandwidth requirements for the premium user that has higher priority.

either BS-3 or BS-4 after the vehicle passes through the intersection. The difficult part is that the 
server cannot determine which direction the user may drive to, so the system will select the 
farthest BS as the next connected BS to pre-load the necessary stream data to keep the seamless 
QoS according the flowchart of Fig. 13. 
 
 
Fig. 6. The scenario of a vehicle passing through a road intersection. 
As shown on the right portion of Fig. 5, when a vehicle is not going to pass through an 
intersection and the distance between the current BS and the next one is small, the system will take 
the actions after label C1, which is also the initial stage as shown in Fig. 7. If a vehicle is going to 
pass through an intersection, he/she can still keep connection with a BS as the case shown in Fig. 
6(a), the system will take the actions after label C1 as well. In either of these two situations, a 
fuzzy logic inference system as shown in Fig. 8 is utilized to determine whether a roadside BS is 
suitable for forwarding the stream data to the vehicle. If all the BSs are not appropriate to 
communicate with the vehicle through the judgment of the system, the server will take the actions 
after label C2, which is also the initial stage in Fig. 10. Then a vehicle will be chosen to forward 
the stream data after label C2. On the other hand, if a BS is selected to transfer stream data, the BS 
will allocate adequate bandwidth to prepare transferring streaming data for users. 
 16
The output of the fuzzy logic system is the estimated appropriateness level of a BS. The 
appropriateness level will be transferred to the server for further instructions. The fuzzy linguistic 
variables used for the output membership function are “low”, “medium”, and “high”, which stand 
for “poor for connection”, “acceptable for connection”, and ”good for connection”, respectively. 
When the server initially classifies the user to take the actions after label C1, then it will begin to 
estimate the condition of the BS via the above-mentioned fuzzy logic inference system.  
 Case 2: Roadside BSs are sparse but vehicles are dense 
When users cannot communicate with the BS, they can also maintain the streaming service 
via each neighboring vehicle to transfer the stream data. In this case, our purpose is to guarantee 
the premium users’ QoS, so the system will ask the neighboring vehicles as transmission nodes to 
transfer the stream data according the route built by the server. Take Fig. 9 as an example. 
Although the premium user in the intersection is out of the range of any roadside BS, he/she can 
still maintain the viewing quality of stream data via other neighboring vehicles, which are all free 
users. 
 
Fig. 9. An example that shows roadside BSs are sparse but the vehicle density is dense. 
Parts of the right portion in Fig. 5 and Fig. 10 show the operations of the system for Case 2. 
In this case, the distance between the current BS and the next one is large, and the vehicle density 
is dense. While entering into label C2 in Fig. 10, the system first uses the fuzzy logic inference 
 18
vehicle to the user is close, they will not easily leave the transmission range of each other and the 
relay vehicle is appropriate for relay the stream data. 
 
Fig. 11. The appropriateness level of the relay vehicle determined by a fuzzy logic system. 
The output of the fuzzy logic system is the estimated appropriateness level of the vehicle as 
the relay node. The appropriateness level will be transferred to the server for further instructions. 
The fuzzy linguistic variables used for the output membership function are “low”, “medium”, and 
“high”, which stand for “poor as a transmission node”, “acceptable as a transmission node”, 
and ”good as a transmission node”, respectively. When the server initially classifies the user as 
Case 2, it will begin to estimate the condition of the vehicles via the above-mentioned fuzzy logic 
inference system.  
 Case 3: The densities of roadsides BSs and vehicle distributions are both low 
An example given in Fig. 12 shows that the large gap between BS-2 and BS-3 will result in a 
possible service disruption. To keep premium users’ viewing quality, the server will ask them to 
activate the pre-loading mechanism to download the compressed stream data in advance. 
 
Fig. 12. An example that shows the densities of roadsides BSs and vehicle distributions are low.

and LZ, which respectively represent the road section with connection and out of the transmission 
range of any BS, are used to calculate the compression ratio of the stream data. Assume that the 
vehicle moves with constant velocity, and the driving times on LA and LZ, are directly proportional 
to the distance. Hence we can determine how much bandwidth we should reserve in advance while 
driving on LZ and further calculate the appropriate compression level of stream data to avoid the 
shortage of bandwidth in the following road section without connection of any BS. Table 1 shows 
the service level of the stream data and its corresponding video resolution quality used in our 
simulation.

The determination of the required bandwidth  on the road section Lz where the vehicle is 
out of the transmission range of any BS is given below,

integrates cellular infrastructure and as hoc distribution network. It uses vehicular mobility profiles 
not only to provide quality yet affordable services but also to predict the vehicle’s possible route, 
velocity, and the required time to get to some specific place in the future. WTSP [17] considers 
two types of communications, including vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure, to 
construct a wireless service platform based on the traffic service central unit, the base station 
network with traffic service base stations, and mobile end users with ad-hoc connectivity and 
backbone network connectivity. It provides the real-time service to the mobile user of less 
bandwidth requirement. 
Throughput, packet loss ratio, and service disruption time are adopted as performance metrics 
in this work. Throughput represents overall multimedia data transmission capacity, which includes 
the data received from adaptive streaming server and the data shared with one another through BSs 
bandwidth sharing mechanism. Packet loss ratio stands for the percentage that packets get lost to 
produce errors in the transmission process. Service disruption time is defined as the period of time 
when the vehicle cannot maintain active connection with the current BS until it connects with a 
new serving BS link and restarts sending and receiving packets.  
Fig. 14 illustrates the packet loss ratio on the condition of different numbers of vehicles 
among the three schemes. As a whole, our proposed ASSD scheme achieves better performance in 
the packet loss ratio than the other. Our ASSD scheme is able to manage different conditions and 
guarantee QoS according to different types of traffic environment. For example, if the density of 
vehicle distribution is low, the proposed prefetch mechanism can avoid the problems of 
transmitted streaming data interruption and delay due to the inadequate hardware resource. On the 
other hand, if vehicle density is high, we select relay vehicles to transmit stream data to make sure 
the QoS for users. However, in the architecture of MoPADS, only a few server stations are 
connected to the backbone via high-bandwidth wires, and the others small BSs access the 
 24
data, the prefetching mechanism will start to make sure uninterrupted transferring of stream data to 
maintain the QoS. MoPADS scheme does not consider vehicle-to-vehicle communication, so 
when the vehicle drives away the coverage of the BS, or faces the shortage of bandwidth provided 
by the small BS, the service disruption time will be obviously increasing when the number of 
vehicles and the requirement of bandwidth increase. On the other hand, since WTSP scheme only 
has vehicle-to-vehicle communication but no service prefetching mechanism to transfer stream 
data, the service disruption time does not significantly get worse when the number of vehicles 
increases.  
 
 
Fig. 15. Comparison of normalized service disruption time among the three algorithms. 
Fig. 16 illustrates the throughput on the condition of different numbers of vehicles among the 
three algorithms. The figure indicates there is no significant difference among the three schemes. 
Although the performance of MoPADS and WTSP in the packet loss ratio and the service 
 26
environment. In this work, an adaptive seamless streaming dissemination system in vehicular 
networks is proposed to solve the above-mentioned problems. Three cases are designed to deal 
with different kinds of network environment according to the number of vehicles and roadside BSs.  
In the case of facing few roadside BSs, the user can still receive the stream data via other vehicles 
as forwarding nodes. When the number of vehicles and roadside BSs is not enough to maintain the 
live streaming service, a pre-loading mechanism will be used to make the premium users enjoy 
satisfying viewing quality to meet a seamless live stream service. Comparing our simulation model 
with the two latest frameworks, including MoPADS and WTSP, the simulation results show that 
our mechanism achieves better performance in terms of packet loss ratio and service disruption 
ratio. The capability of self-adaption in volatile vehicular environment assists in the effectiveness 
and practicability of our proposed approach.

 presents the overall architecture of our correlation process 
and IDS rules tuning module. Section 4 presents the results 
of applying the rules generated from IDS tuning module. 
Finally, section 5 draws conclusions and outlines future work. 
II. RELATED WORK 
In recent years, researchers and vendors have proposed 
alert correlation to reduce the number of alerts that need to 
be manually analyzed, and the relevance and abstraction 
level of the IDS resulting reports is thus increased. Even the 
goals of correlation seem to be well-defined, the correlation 
approaches proposed in the literature focused on variety of 
purposes of the correlation process, making it difficult to 
compare the results of each solution [4]. However, there are 
some limitations of the correlation approaches applied in the 
proposed model. For example, time setting of aggregation 
algorithm and the number of correlating nodes are uncertain, 
and the repository of causal correlation needs to be updated. 
Although Yi presented a deductive approach of alert 
correlation algorithm which performs deductive analysis on 
the original alerts generated by IDS in a backward fashion, 
the validity of the proposed algorithm is not verified. 
In spite that numerous correlation approaches have been 
proposed, there is still no consensus on what correlation 
process should be or how it is implemented and evaluated. 
For example, existing correlation approaches operate on only 
partial aspects of the correlation process, such as the fusion 
of alerts that are generated by different IDSs in response to a 
single attack. In this work, we follow the comprehensive 
approach to intrusion detection proposed by Valeu. These 
correlation approaches have been designed to be as complete 
as possible and to include all the aspects of correlation 
discussed in previous research efforts. We build a multi-
stage framework that implements the correlation process and 
analyze a number of data sets to produce specific parameter 
of each individual alert to the IDS tuning module and then 
the life time of temperately rule can be intelligently 
determined.  
III. ALERT CORRELATION DETECTION AND RULE TUNING 
MODULE 
Figure 1.  The architecture of alert correlation detection and rule tuning 
model for IDS. 
A. Preprocessing module 
The correlation process may receive alerts from different 
IDSs, and these alerts can be encoded in different formats. 
Firstly, preprocessing procedure translates all attributes of 
each sensor alert into a common format and supplies, as 
accurately as possible, missing alert attributes, such as source 
IP, target IP start time, end time, and service port, for later 
use by correlation components. Then the alerts with 
completely detailed information will be stored in the central 
historical alert database for further references, say, in the 
alert correlation module.  
When the amount of alerts overpasses the threshold, the 
alert reduction module is launched to reduce the correlative 
alerts and verify the attack behavior of alerts. Notably, the 
initial threshold is defined with an initial value when the 
intelligent IDS tuning system launches first time. After the 
system finishes a whole round of examination, the threshold 
is dynamically adjusted by the occurrence frequency of each 
attack alert. The occurrence frequency of each attack alert is 
calculated so that the system can refer to the first quartile and 
third quartile of these frequencies to determine the new 
threshold that will be used for next round of examination. 
The computation of the new threshold is expressed by, In order to generate temporary blocking rules for 
ignoring continually correlative alerts of the high-relative 
attacks within a specific time interval, we propose the 
method of adapting parameters, obtained from the 
correlation module and the lifetime of historical rule in the 
IDS tuning module, to intelligently generate temporary 
blocking rules, which can be further attached in the IDS rules 
database for N-IDS and H-IDS. Referring to the 
comprehensive approach to intrusion detection proposed by 
Valeur, we propose a multi-stage approach, which includes 
five main components, that is, N-IDS/H-IDS sensors, 
preprocessing module, alert correlation detection module, 
historical IDS rule checker, and rule tuning module. The 
detailed architecture of our intelligent tuning system was 
showed in Figure 1. .

Assumed that input data of type-2 fuzzy system is 
11 Xx  , 22 Xx  ,….. and pp Xx   and, fuzzy output sets 
is Yy , The rule of type-2 fuzzy system is denoted as

3) Inference Engine 
Inference Engine is the key component of a fuzzy logic 
inference system. As shown in Figure 3. , the inference 
engine calculates a firing level, which is the weight of each 
fired rule, based on the input and the antecedents of the rules, 
and then applies these firing levels to the consequent fuzzy 
sets. In a type-2 fuzzy logic system, each fuzzy rule has its 
own firing strengths, and membership function values with 
different input parameters in a fuzzy rule proceed to t-norm 
operation to obtain firing strengths for the consequent. In 
general, minimum and product operators are two most 
commonly used t-norm operations for a fuzzy logic inference 
system, upper and lower firing levels for the consequent, iG~ , 
can be expressed by,

In a type-2 fuzzy logic inference system, the output set

computational efficiency. The two end points, ly  and ry , 
that determine the interval set as shown above, corresponds 
to the centroid of the type-2 interval consequent set iG~  of

           Abstract - In the past, the utilization of the limb 
prosthesis has improved the daily life of amputees or patients 
with movement disorders. However, a leg-amputee has to take 
a series of training after wearing a limb prosthesis, and the 
training results determine whether a patient can use the limb 
prosthesis correctly in her/his daily life. This work proposes a 
prosthesis training system to allow the amputees to train 
themselves. Instant feedback messages provided by the 
prosthesis training system are used to correct their walking 
postures during the self-training process. An embedded chip is 
used as a core to establish a body area sensor network for the 
prosthesis training system. RFID readers and tags are 
employed to acquire the 3D positioning information of the 
amputee’s limbs in this work to assist in diagnosing the 
amputee’s walking problem. The simulation results exhibit the 
effectiveness and practicability of the proposed prosthesis 
training system.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 The leg-amputees who wear lower-limb prostheses 
suffer from attenuated tactile knowledge of their extension, 
owing to the natural sensory loss resulting from amputation. 
Many clinical studies report that amputees exhibit an 
asymmetrical gait pattern [1]. For example, unilateral 
transtibial amputees generally have higher hip extension, 
knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion in amputated side than 
those in the unaffected side. Leg-amputees are accustomed 
to the asymmetrical gait pattern if they do not take a series 
of training after wearing limb prosthesis. Apart from 
discomfort, the amputees might suffer from some spinal 
deformities or muscle injuries. Owing to lacking of exercise, 
muscular flaccidity might occur and the stumps will be 
getting swollen resulting in that patients can not swing their 
thighs backward, and the shank and the knee joint cannot be 
straightened. Therefore, an expert had better accompany the 
amputee during the training process to rectify the amputee’s 
gait and the training expense is accordingly significantly 
increased.  
 It was reported in [2] that a microprocessor-controlled 
prosthetic knee can use onboard electronic sensors to collect 
real-time data and control stance and swing phase 
movements as well. The human-machine interface for the 
prosthesis socket has to be properly designed to achieve 
satisfactory load transmission, stability, and efficient control 
for mobility [3]. The powered ankle–foot prosthesis is 
capable of providing human-like ankle work and power 
during stance and decreasing the metabolic cost of transport 
compared with the conventional passive-elastic prosthesis 
[4]. The prosthetic legs outfitted with Bluetooth technology 
were designed in [5] to make two limbs coordinate each 
other to control the leg movement. Despite a multitude of 
technical advances in lower-limb prostheses have been 
observed in the literature, no existing approaches are able to 
warn the amputee for the detection of the asymmetrical gait. 
Though Bluetooth prosthesis can automatically control the 
leg movement for the amputee, the amputee might suffer 
from uncomfortable and uncoordinated walking. A well-
designed gait training process for rehabilitation is thus still 
demanded. In the recent positioning technology, R. Want 
[6] uses diffuse infrared to develop an active badge 
positioning system. Users wear badges that transmit infrared 
signals to provide information about their location to a 
centralized location service via a network of sensors. 
However, the infrared signals have the weakness of moving 
in a straight line, short transmission distance, and easily 
disturbed by the environment.  
 It was observed that some sequelae may arise in the 
traditional way of gait training due to insufficient gait 
experts’ training or relatively high fee. Moreover, the 
evaluation of gait training effectiveness relies upon 
accumulated experiences that gait trainer owns and little 
explicit criterion can be followed. Accordingly, many 
general statements are used in training records that cause 
difficult tracing of therapy process. To tackle above-
mentioned problems, several important factors are 
considered in this work, including setting up the quantitative 
index for leg-amputees training effectiveness assessment, 
providing real-time guidance for self-training at home, 
establishing the mechanism of supervising and tracing 
training process of leg-amputees, offering easy installation, 
operation, and maintenance to leg-amputees, and 
considering the affordability of mid and low income 
families.  
 A body area sensor network (BASN) is employed in the 
work. A BASN consists of multiple interconnected nodes 
on, near, or within a human body, which together provide 
sensing, processing, and communication capabilities. 
Through intelligent computing techniques, a BASN can be

A.  RFID Positioning Module 
 
 Received Signal Strength (RSS) is adopted as the 
parameter of the RFID positioning algorithm to estimate the 
distance between the sender and the receiver. The detected 
signal strength decreases with the increasing distance to the 
sender. Thus, the detected signal will differ when the 
receiver is at different location. It can be shown that the 
remaining power of wave receiver in the signal propagation 
can be expressed as follows.

 The railing and tag screen employed in the gait training 
of leg-amputee is shown in Fig.2(a1). The RFID reader 
installed in the lower-limb prosthesis, as illustrated in 
Fig.2(a2), can read several RFID tag data simultaneously. In 
the meantime, the locations of RFID reader and the two tags 
shown in Fig.2(b) will form a triangle. The length a as given 
in Fig.2(b) denotes the spacing between two RFID tags and 
it is fixed and set beforehand. The lengths b and c can be 
derived from signal strength of RSSI. D(xD , yD) represents 
the coordinate of RFID reader projected on the bottom line 
of the triangle, and d can be derived accordingly by means 
of Pythagoras theorem. After all RFID readers are 
positioned, the training gait pattern recording module will 
take the responsibility for recording the variation of gait 
patterns of the amputee.

III.  SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
 In the experiments conducted in this research, 27 
kinds of gait patterns were identified by experienced 
experts who specialize in prosthesis training. 912 gait 
training patterns were collected from the leg-amputees 
during real gait training process and were classified by an 
expert. The classification accuracy ratio was computed by 
using the leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) 
technique to examine the effectiveness of the proposed 
training system. Notably, the LOOCV method removes a 
single sample in each trial, trains on the rest, and then 
tests the classifier on the removed single sample. 
 The classification results are given in TABLE 1. It 
can be seen that accuracy ratio of the proposed training 
system is 88.9803% in average. It can be observed that 
the proposed prosthesis training system not only detects 
the movements of leg-amputees, but also classifies most 
of the gait patterns correctly. Meanwhile, the performance 
of the three compared classifier is about the same. The 
simulation results thus exhibit the effectiveness and 
practicability of the proposed prosthesis training system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
 
 A prosthesis training system that utilizes an angular 
comparison method is proposed in this work to replace the 
traditional graphic comparison method owing to the 
requests for automatic and real-time guidance. A so-called 
dissimilarity degree is defined in this work to diagnose 
abnormal gait patterns that the trainee might suffer from. 
Instant and adaptive feedback messages that are useful to 
correct their walking postures are given by the prosthesis 
training system during the self-training process. An 
evaluation metric is presented in this work to assist in 
providing suitable messages to the trainees under different 
training stages. A series of simulations were conducted in 
order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. 
The simulation results reveal the effectiveness and 
practicability of proposed prosthesis training system. 
 The economic factor usually determines whether a 
leg-amputee can accept complete and sufficient gait 
training. The cost of the proposed system is affordable to 
the trainees owing to wide deployment of the low-cost 
RFIDs. In addition, the new gait samples can be added in 
the database with the assistance of the experts if a 
mismatch occurs between the training pattern and the 
samples recorded in the database. Therefore, the 
prosthesis training system proposed this work can greatly 
benefit the amputees because they can borrow or buy 
from the limb prosthesis vendors and train themselves at 
home. The future work will focus on developing more 
advanced algorithms in order to improve the classification 
accuracy of the proposed work.

position. 
A. Mobility prediction module 
This module is proposed to predict the mobility pattern of 
MH. There are three cases of mobility prediction according 
to MHs’ moving characteristics, including the low-speed 
pedestrian’s mobility prediction, the fixed-route vehicle’s 
mobility prediction, and the prediction for a MH on the 
driveway.  
1) Low-speed pedestrian’s mobility prediction 
The predicted location of a MH may be changed due to 
the MH’s movement. We assume that the MH’s next 
possible location after a period of time t can be expressed by, 
  xutt tecxp )(
where x is the moved location of the MH,  is the 
probability distribution function in terms of time, and is a 
preset constant.

where x0 is the initial position of the MH, x is the moved 
location, a denotes the acceleration, v0 is the initial velocity, 
and t stands for duration of the movement. 
Three cases are considered for a pedestrian’s mobility 
prediction here.  
 Case 1: The probability that a MH will move into the 
coverage of a BS 
As shown in Fig. 2(a), a MH, X, is currently outside 
the coverage of all BSs. Take Fig. 2(a) as an 
example, the probability density function that MH, X, 
will move into the communication range of the BS1 
can be shown as follows,

where R represents the radius of the communication

location of the BS1.

of all BSs. 
(b) The illustration of a MH moving out of the coverage of a BS. 
 Case 2: The probability that a MH moves out of the 
coverage of a BS 
As shown in Fig. 2(b), the MH X can be anywhere 
inside the communication coverage of BS1. The 
probability density function for the MH X moving 
out of the coverage of BS1 can then be expressed as 
follows.

 Case 3: The probability that a MH will handoff from 
one BS to a neighboring BS 
As shown in Fig. 3, the MH X resides within BS1 
and near the coverage of BS1 and BS2. If we want to 
compute the probability of the MH X moving to the 
coverage of BS2, i.e. the gray area in Fig. 3, we first 
calculate the probability PX,A by the following 
equation,

B. Remaining bandwidth estimation module 
A bandwidth reservation mechanism for the 
heterogeneous wireless networks is established at each BS 
in this work for the consideration of the possible arriving 
MHs outside the coverage of the BS. The equation for 
estimating remaining bandwidth can be expressed as follows,

C. Common bandwidth utilization optimization module  
In the past research of the bandwidth utilization issues, 
most approaches cannot effectively allocate bandwidth for 
MHs because of the volatile behavior of the MHs. We thus 
adopt an optimization approach to resolve this issue. 
Modified from the work of Wu & Liao [4], we propose an 
objective function for the optimal bandwidth allocation as 
follows,

bandwidth utilization rate of BS i. The indices j and k used 
in (28) and (29), which are identical to the ones used in (25), 
represents the index of the MH currently resides in BS i and 
that of an incoming handoff, respectively.  
a) Hybrid Genetic Algorithm 
Fig. 5 shows the evolving procedures of GA adopted in 
this work. We first transfer the bandwidth which the BS 
intends to allocate to the MHs into a binary code as the 
initial population, called chromosomes. Each element in the 
chromosome is either 0 or 1, and the higher fitness value 
will be kept to generate the next generation during the 
procedure of crossover and mutation.

Figure 11.  The comparison of overall bandwidth utilization. 
Figure 8.  The comparison of overall throughput. 
The comparison of average delay is shown in Fig. 9. The 
other two approaches do not consider the mobility prediction. 
Instead, by considers MH’s mobility to make a more effective 
management of handoff, bandwidth reservation, and 
admission control, our approach not only guarantees network 
stability, but also effectively lowers average delay, and then 
achieves better QoS for MHs.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
An adaptive bandwidth allocation mechanism for 
MHs in heterogeneous network environments is proposed. 
Our work that considers user mobility can accurately predict 
whether the handoffs may occur and thus effectively 
improve network utilization. A novel bandwidth utilization 
optimization technique is employed to allocate the 
bandwidth efficiently among the heterogeneous wireless 
networks. The experimental results show that our algorithm 
achieves better network utilization, throughput and QoS 
quality. The capability of self-adaption in volatile radio 
access technologies assists in the effectiveness and 
practicability of our proposed approach.

result, the jitter performance of our proposed scheme is more 
stable than NGTF and DCDRA.
