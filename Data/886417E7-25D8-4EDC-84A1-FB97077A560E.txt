一、中文摘要
此專題的目的是將常溫及高溫下碳
面(000-1)4H-碳化矽金氧半界面的特性
最佳化。由於，二氧化矽可以直接從碳
化物矽晶片表面氧化生成，比其他的複
合材料更具優點；而且，金氧半界面特
性的探討更是所有碳化矽金氧半場效電
晶體研究的基礎。因此，探討是碳面碳
化矽金氧半電容器就顯得極度重要。這
次金氧半電容器的探討主要是專注在界
面陷阱密度和氧化層強度。一旦低界面
陷阱密度和高品質的氧化層強度可被達
成，碳面碳化矽金氧半場效電晶體的通
道載子流動力就可被提高而且在碳化矽
和氧化層界面的漏電流也會消除，同時
也可避免在閘極和汲極之間發生短線。
在這專題中，金氧半電容器將被製
作在有磊晶層的四度 4H-碳面碳化矽晶
圓上。首先，在不同溫度下 4H-碳面碳
化矽的氧化層成長速度將被實驗推算出
來，然後，溼的和乾的熱氧化過程狀態
將被調整去改善界面陷阱密度和氧化層
強度。我們希望在這專題中碳面碳化矽
的 氧 化 層 崩 潰 電 場 強 度 可 提 升 至 8
MV/cm 以上而且界面陷阱密度可降至
6x10 1 1 cm - 2eV - 1 在導通帶以下能量為 0.2
eV 的位置，因為目前發表過的數據中，
最佳的碳面碳化矽的氧化層崩潰電場強
度大約是 7 MV/cm 而使用熱氧化過程穫
得最低的界面陷阱密度大約是 7x10 1 1
cm - 2eV - 1 。
英文摘要
The purpose of this project is to optimize
carbon face (000-1) 4H-SiC MOS interface
characteristics at room temperature and high
temperature. Because oxide layer can be directly
grown from the SiC substrate, SiC material is
superior to other compound semiconductor
materials. In addition, the interface
characteristics are fundamentals of 4H-SiC
MOSFET research. Therefore, it is extremely
important to investigate carbon face 4H-SiC
MOS-Capacitors. The investigation on MOS-C
will be focused on the interface trap density and
oxide strength. Once low interface trap density
and high quality silicon dioxide are achieved,
The channel mobility of carbon face 4H-SiC
MOSFET can be increased and leakage current
at SiC/SiO2 interface can be eliminated and short
circuits between gate and drain regions can be
avoided as well.
In this work, MOS-Capacitors will be
fabricated on 4o carbon-face 4H-SiC samples
with one epitaxial layer. First, the oxide growth
rate at different temperatures for carbon face
4H-SiC will be determined and then wet and dry
thermal oxidation conditions will be modified to
improve the interface trap density and oxide
strength. We hope the oxide breakdown field of
carbon face 4H-SiC can be increased up to 8
removal of sacrificial oxide. These 4o angle off
samples with 10-m thick epilayer were then
used to fabricate the MOS capacitors. Prior to
gate oxidation and NO nitridation, samples were
chemically cleaned with Acetone, Toluene, and
Methanol to remove grease on the surface and
then cleaned by piranha solution (H2SO4: H2O2 =
1:1), followed by an RCA clean. One wet
oxidation was carried out in the pyrogenic
system for 90 min at 1150 oC and followed by
30min argon (Ar) anneal at the same temperature
and re-oxidation at 950 oC. Theses C-face
samples were for reference, compared with
Si-face 4H-SiC samples since the oxidation
conditions are the standard for the Si-face
samples. Wet oxidations of one set were
performed in the pyrogenic system for 15min,
30min, 60min, and 90min at a certain
temperature, which were set at 850 oC, 900 oC,
950 oC, and 1000 oC for 4 sets of C-face samples.
Oxidations were followed by 30min Ar anneal at
the same oxidation temperature. However, there
was no re-oxidation at 950 oC applied to these
samples. All samples were then passivated by
NO anneal at 1175 oC immediately after the
oxidation. The photolithography was carried out
to define the MOS capacitors. Aluminum was
then deposited using CHA ebeam evaporator and
followed by lift-off technology to form
aluminum gate electrodes. The areas used in this
work are 1.6 x 10-3 cm2 and 4 x 10-4 cm2.
Post-metallization annealing was not performed
to all samples. Oxide thickness was determined
by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements
which were performed at room temperature
using the computer-controlled HP 4284A
parameter analyzer. Interface trap density was
determined by the high- and low-frequency C-V
measurements using a computer-controlled
Keithley 590 CV analyzer, 595 Quasistatic CV
meter, and 5951 coupler at room temperature.
Oxide thickness can be deduced from the
accumulation capacitance of the high frequency
C-V curve in this system as well. The forward
current-voltage (I-V) measurements were
performed at room temperature using HP 4156A
analyzer to determine the oxide breakdown field.
四、成果與討論
Oxidation
It is well known that SiC surface
decomposes at high temperature during loading
in the thermal oxidation, and this surface
decomposition degrades MOS interface quality.
Adachi, et al, showed that silicon atoms
evaporate from the surface and make the surface
graphitic while SiC is at high temperature in the
inert ambient.7 In order to prevent silicon loss
from the surface, samples are loaded into the
furnace at 850 oC in dry oxygen ambient then
temperature is slowly raised to 1150 oC under
flowing oxygen. Wet oxygen oxidation is
performed at 1150 oC. The oxidation is usually
followed by a 30min in-situ Ar anneal at the
same temperature. Ar anneal is used to make CO
diffuse out from the oxide, not to remove excess
carbon atoms on the surface. Interface traps at
the SiO2/SiC interface can be reduced by the
re-oxidation at lower temperature, 950 oC.
Samples are then unloaded from the re-oxidation
ambient. Lipkin, et al., have obtained low oxide
charges and interface trap density by using
reoxidation at 950 oC. 8
The oxide thickness, tOX, can be calculated using
the following equation once oxide capacitance
According to the results, there is no direct
evidence showing that 60min, 120min, and
150min NO anneals enhance C-face oxide
breakdown field. This may be because that
nitrogen only accumulates at SiO2/SiC interface
during NO anneal.9 In addition, the passivation
with nitrogen is proportional to nitrogen content,
and independent of anneal time. Therefore, the
effect of passivation with nitrogen will saturate
once the nitrogen concentration reaches to a
certain value.10,11 However, the oxide breakdown
field passivated with ammonia is much lower
than those with NO anneal due to the nitrogen
distribution uniformly throughout the whole
oxide layer.9
Oxide breakdown filed, EOX, can be calculated
from forward I-V measurement using equations
below.

E  (2)
VOX = VG - VFB
(3)
where VOX is the voltage at which oxide breaks
down. VG is the applied gate voltage and VFB is
the flat band voltage.
In this work, the oxide breakdown field was
determined by dividing the applied gate voltage
by oxide thickness because the flat band voltage
for n-type 4H-SiC MOS-C is close to zero. Fig. 2
shows the oxide breakdown field of undoped
C-face 4H-SiC samples is less than 7 MV/cm.
The oxidation was carried out in the wet oxygen
ambient at 1150 oC for 90min. Then, samples
were immediately annealed with NO at 1175 oC.
The breakdown field of an undoped Si-face
4H-SiC sample is about 9 MV/cm while the
oxidation was carried out in the wet oxygen
ambient at 1150 oC.12 This indicates a
temperature of 1150 oC may not be suitable for
C-face 4H-SiC MOSFET fabrication due to the
poor oxide breakdown field and thick oxide
thickness, compared with Si-face 4H-SiC.
Therefore, the lower-temperature wet oxidations
were used to achieve oxide thickness range of
500 Å and improve the oxide breakdown field.
Fig. 2 The oxide breakdown field of C-face 4H-SiC
samples. The oxidation was carried out in the wet oxygen
ambient at 1150 oC for 90min then annealed with NO at
1175 oC.
The best oxide breakdown fields for
oxidation temperatures of 850 oC, 900 oC, 950
oC, and 1000 oC are about 8 MV/cm shown in
Fig. 3, respectively. However, there is no oxide
breakdown filed of 7 MV/cm measured at the
oxidation temperature of 1150 oC, shown in Fig.
2. This indicates that the oxide breakdown field
may increase to 7 or 8 MV/cm as the oxidation
temperature is reduced. The influence of the
lower oxidation temperature on the C-face oxide
breakdown field is very limited, while the
rate. This explains why aluminum dopant has
thicker oxide layer than a non-implanted region.
Fig. 4 The oxide breakdown fields of Al-implanted C-face
4H-SiC samples. Post-implant Ar anneal at 1600 oC for
10min, and wet oxidations at 950 oC for 17.5min and
followed by NO anneal at 1175 oC for 150min.
Interface Trap density
It is well known that poor performance of
SiC MOSFETs is caused by the high
on-resistance. The on-resistance is dominated by
the high inversion channel resistance which
results from low carrier mobility in the channel.
Low channel mobility is caused by high interface
trap density at the SiO2/SiC interface and surface
roughness.5 4H-SiC is preferred over 6H-SiC
due to its high bulk electron mobility. However,
reported channel mobility of 4H-SiC is much
lower than 6H-SiC because high interface trap
density located at approximately 2.9eV above the
valence band edge is the dominant factor. Due to
6H-SiC bandgap of 3eV, most of these traps lie
in the conduction band of 6H-SiC and have weak
influence on inversion channel mobility.
However, 4H-SiC has a wider bandgap of 3.3eV,
so that most traps lie inside the bandgap near the
conduction band edge, where they can reduce
channel mobility by field termination, carrier
trapping, and Coulomb scattering. There are
three possible effects of interface states to lower
the channel mobility. First, most interface states,
filled by electrons, will be either neutral or
negatively charged when MOSFETs are in
inversion. If they are neutral, Coulombic
scattering will not occur. Otherwise, Coulombic
scattering will occur and reduce the channel
mobility. Second, these interface states also
reduce mobile charges in the channel. The total
charges at the interface are limited to prevent
oxide breakdown. Since the filled interface states
account for a significant part of the total charge,
the mobile charges are reduced, and the current
is reduced. Third, the surface roughening during
the implant activation anneal will result in step
bunching on the surface. The larger macrosteps
can be the order of a gate oxide thickness,
thereby introducing discontinuities along the
surface channel and increasing scattering events
in the channel.
To date, many methods have been developed to
minimize interface states, like nitric oxide (NO)
anneal, nitrous oxide (N2O) anneal, H2/H2O
vapor atmosphere, and hydrogen (H2)
post-oxidation annealing (POA).16-18 The
incorporation of nitrogen at the SiO2/SiC
interface passivates interface traps by forming
strong Si-N bonds at the interface. C-N bonds are
concerned as being associated with the
nitrogen-assisted removal of carbon from the
SiO2/SiC interface.19 Mobile hydrogen atoms can
passivate dangling bonds of Si at the surface as
well.20
The interface trap density can be determined
from MOS-C devices via using high-low C-V
measurement. The hf C-V curve can be a
by NO anneal at 1175 oC. in addition, wet
oxidation is better than dry oxidation in the
interface trap density for C-face 4H-SiC.
六、計畫成果自評
This research was carried out very well.
Important data such as oxide growth rate on
C-face 4H-SiC, oxide strength on non- and
Al-implanted regions, and interface trap density
is achieved as planed in the proposal. These
results are very critical to SiC semiconductor
processes because methods described in previous
paragraphs can enhance oxide strength and
reduce interface traps so that device performance
can be improved. Therefore, this work is very
valuable for SiC semiconductor fabrication,
especially for MOSFET and MOS-C. These
results are planed to submit to Journal of
Electronic Materials. In addition, some pieces of
C-face 4H-SiC were re-used to fabricate
Schottky barrier diodes (SBD). The paper about
C-face 4H-SiC SBD is accepted and will be
published in Physica B: Condensed Matter.

2large size SBDs. Breakdown voltages of 1500 m and 2000 m 4o Si-face SBDs can
reach over 1000V. This value is about two times higher than the other two samples,
though the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4o Si-face samples obtained from
atomic force microscopy (AFM) is 3.5 nm. The yield of 1500m and 2000m 4o Si-face
4H-SiC SBDs with a breakdown voltage over 1000V is more than 50%, much higher than
the other two samples.

4much lower than expected from theoretical calculations, is examined for SBDs on 4o
C-face, 4o Si-face, and 8o Si-face 4H-SiC.
2. Experiment
Silicon carbide SBDs with diameters from 100m to 2000m are fabricated on
three different types of 4H-SiC substrates. An 8o, n-type Si-face 4H-SiC substrate with 10
m-thick epilayer is purchased from Cree Inc. The doping concentration of this epilayer is
6x1015cm-3. The other two substrates, 4o, n-type C- and Si-face 4H-SiC, are purchased
from Cree Inc. 10m-thick epilayers have been grown on both 4o C- and Si -face 4H-SiC
substrates using a low-pressure, hot-wall chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system at
Purdue University. The doping concentration is about 1.5x1015 cm-3. The nominal
breakdown voltages for two doping/thickness combinations are approximately 1600 V and
1800 V, respectively. Samples are chemically cleaned before a 400 Å sacrificial oxide is
grown by wet oxidation at 1150oC for 1.5 hours. An ion implantation masking layer
consisting of 100 Å Ti and 5000 Å Au is then deposited and patterned on the sacrificial
oxide. Boron is implanted to a dose of 1x1015 cm-2 at 30 keV for resistive termination
extension (RTE) [5]. The width of the termination is 100m. Damage caused by ion
implantation is partially recovered by post-implant annealing at 1050oC for 90 minutes [6].
6of 4o Si-face and C-face epilayers obtained from AFM is 3.5 nm and 0.2 nm, respectively
as shown in Fig. 2. In forward bias mode, ideality factor for SBDs on three substrates is all
about 1.1. The average Schottky barrier height for the C-face and two Si-face SBDs
determined from I-V characteristics is about 1.26 eV, 1.4 eV, and 1.4 eV, respectively.
Fig. 3 shows reverse current–voltage characteristics of 100m SBDs on three
substrates. The leakage current of 4o Si-face 4H-SiC is smaller than the other two samples,
though RMS roughness of 4o Si-face 4H-SiC is higher. Since visible surface defects such
as micropipes, comets, carrots, hillocks, and growth pits are not located on SBDs, this can
explain that the curvature of bunching step is not large enough to cause thermionic field
emission, leading to large leakage current [8-10]. In addition, the density of invisible sharp
pits on 4o Si-face 4H-SiC should be lower than the other two samples because invisible
sharp pits with large curvature may be the major factor causing leakage current and
premature breakdown [8-10]. Since ideal parallel plate breakdown voltages of 8o Si-face,
4o Si-face and 4o C-face wafers are about 1600 V, 1800 V, and 1800 V, respectively, the
real breakdown voltage of each SBD represented in this article is normalized for
comparison. Measured breakdown voltages of SBDs with diameters from 100m to
2000m are divided by the ideal breakdown voltage and shown in Fig. 4. For 100m
SBDs, average breakdown voltage can reach 76% of the ideal breakdown voltage due to
8indicates that 4o Si-face 4H-SiC may be a better material for the fabrication of large area
SBDs, compared with 4o C-face and 8o Si-face substrates.
