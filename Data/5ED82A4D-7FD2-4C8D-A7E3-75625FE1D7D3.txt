Abstract 
 
Introduction: Diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI) has already proven to be a valuable 
tool when investigating both global and 
regional microstructural white matter (WM) 
brain changes in the human aging process.  
Method: The subjects in this study were 
recruited from a general health screening 
programme in the Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su 
Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. 
 All participants received detailed 
health examinations, including physical and 
neurological examinations, a biochemistry 
study, a chest x-ray, an electrocardiogram, 
and an electroencephalogram. 
Result: In this work, we incorporated 
polynomial regression models in the 
voxel-based DTI analysis framework to 
assess age-related changes in WM diffusion 
properties (fractional anisotropy and axial, 
transverse, and mean diffusivity) in a large 
cohort of 346 subjects (25 to 81 years old). 
Our novel approach clearly demonstrates that 
voxel-based DTI analyses can greatly benefit 
from incorporating higher-order regression 
models when investigating potential 
relationships between aging and diffusion 
properties. 
Key words: signal processing, Image 
processing, Aging, Cerebro-vascular risk

Introduction 
 
1. Aging effect in white matter 
The normal adult brain undergoes 
considerable morphological changes as it 
ages. Both a decrease in brain weight and an 
increase in cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) filled 
spaces, caused by ventricle dilation and 
sulcal enlargement, have been documented 
by autopsy studies
1,2
. Different components 
of tissue loss in the aging brain have also 
been reported. Post-mortem studies of 
normal subjects have also revealed a readily 
detectable degradation in the WM 
microstructure, such as a decline in the 
number of myelinated fibers of the precentral 
gyrus and the corpus callosum, or even 
axonal loss
3,4
.  
Neuroimaging technology like magnetic 
 4 
of the MRI signal. Head motion was 
minimized by the use of tightly padded 
clamps attached to the head coil. Trans-axial 
T2-weighted, FLAIR images (voxel size= 
0.45×0.45×6.5 mm
3
) and high-resolution 
sagittal T1-weighted images (voxel 
size=1.0×1.0×1.0 mm
3
) were additionally 
acquired.  
For the whole-brain DTI study, we used 
single-shot spin-echo echo planar fat 
suppression sequences (TR/TE=7600/82 ms, 
3 mm slice thickness without gap, slice 
acquisition matrix=128×128 with FOV= 
256×256 mm
2
, 6/8 partial Fourier, NEX=2, 
and 55 slices in total) for one non-DW image 
(b value=0 s/mm
2
) and 12 diffusion- 
weighted (DW) images (with b value=1000 
s/mm
2
). The images were axially collected 
with total scan duration of 4 min. 
3. Method of Image process steps: 
Image analysis preprocessing:  
(A) Customized T2-weighted template. 
(B) Individual‟s T2-weighted image. (C) 
Individual‟s FA before motion and residual 
eddy current distortion correction. (D) 
Individual‟s FA after correction. (E) 
Normalized MD image after affine 
coregistration. (F) Normalized FA image 
after affine coregistration.(Fig 1)

4. Voxel-based statistical analysis 
The MD, FA, λ⊥, and λ|| were used as 
the dependent variables to search for the 
best-fitting higher-order polynomial 
regression model in each voxel as a function 
of age. First, the data from each voxel were 
fitted to each of the four multiple regression 
models (Table 1). Each model included (i) a 
subject gender term; (ii) constant, linear, 
quadratic, or cubic polynomial regression 
term(s) of centered age; and (iii) an 
age-by-gender interaction term (except the 
constant model).Secondly, the controlled 
FDR (nonparametric method) was applied to 
all significant voxels to correct for multiple 
comparisons in each model
29,30
. Significant 
FDR levels were set at a corrected p 
value<0.01 for all higher-order regression 
models (corresponding uncorrected p value 
from 2.8×10
−4
 to 7.2×10
−6
 in each voxel from 
the constant regression model to the cubic 
regression model). Voxels surviving these 
tests in each model were considered 
significant for each regression model. 
Thirdly, to determine the best-fitting model 
from all regression models in each survived 
voxel, the adjusted R
2
 value from each 
regression model was calculated. The model 
with the highest adjusted R
2
 was considered 
as the best-fitting model for this voxel. An 
analysis flowchart is depicted in Fig.2 to 
further elucidate this polynomial voxel-based 
analysis framework.

2. Voxel-based analysis of DTI indices 
The voxel-based FA analysis showed a 
significant negative association with age in 
the bilateral frontal, the genu, and body of 
corpus callosum, the bilateral anterior and 
posterior limbs of internal capsule, the 
bilateral anterior and posterior periventricular 
region, and the bilateral deep temporal 
regions. Two clusters with spatial extent 
above 20 voxels located in the left putamen 
and periventricular white matter showed a 
positive FA change with age (Fig.4). After 
controlled FDR (<0.01), there were 11,109 
voxels showing a significant and negatively 
age-related FA change. The most frequently 
best-fitting model of FA change with age in 
significant voxels was the linear model rather 
than any of the higher-order regression 
models. Only 13.9% showed a significant 
quadratic or cubic association with age. In 
these voxels, there were eight clusters with a 
spatial extent large than 20 voxels (Table 4). 
Two larger clusters (250 and 72 voxels) with 
a significant quadratic association of FA 
change with age were located in the body of 
corpus callosum. The mean FA value in these 
clusters showed a gradual increase up to 40 
years of age and then progressively 
decreased (Fig. 5). Several subregions of the 
corpus callosum demonstrated different 
age-related changes in the FA analysis. In the 
splenium of corpus callosum, there is no 
significant age-related FA change, but 
significant linear and even higher-order 
age-related FA changes can be found in the 
body of corpus callosum. 
The voxel-based MD analysis showed a 
more pronounced higherorder regression 
change with age than in the FA analysis. The 
regions showing significant positive 
age-related MD changes include the bilateral 
frontal regions, the anterior corpus callosum, 
the bilateral anterior and posterior 
periventricular regions, the bilateral anterior 
limb of the internal capsule, the bilateral 
thalamus, and the bilateral cerebellum. On

gradual decrease.

Discussion 
 
In accordance with other brain aging 
studies that use DTI data, we have 
demonstrated that several diffusion 
parameters (FA, MD, λ||, and λ⊥) are 
age-related
10-12,14,17,31
. In contrast to previous 
studies, however, the present study has two 
distinguished features that need to be 
mentioned. The first important aspect is that 
great care has been put in the subject 
selection procedure. It is known that deep 
WM lesions may be seen on MR imaging in 
approximately one-third of asymptomatic 
elderly subjects, but their significance 
remains unclear
32
.WMdamage, such as 
ischemic leukoaraiosis, could impair 
directional diffusion and tissue organization 
and, therefore, can cause alterations in FA or 
other DTI indices. To avoid confounding 
effects from WM diseases, we adopted an 
objective and quantitative method (ARWMC 
score) to exclude subjects with large deep 
and periventricular WM abnormalities as 
detected by their T2-weighted or FLAIR 
 10 
diffusivity changes within the thalamus
9,16
. 
Recently, volumetric MRI analyses have 
shown a significant thalamic volume loss 
during the aging process
18,34
. Ota
35 
also 
observed that age-related FA and MD 
alterations can be found in the anterior and 
central subregions of the thalamus. 
Large areas of age-related MD 
alterations in cerebral and cerebellar cortex 
have also been shown in our study. However, 
these areas were found neither in the 
age-related FA change nor in the difference 
between age-related alteration in axial and 
transverse eigenvalues (Fig. 7).  
 
Summary 
 
In conclusion, our results demonstrate 
that higher-order polynomial regression 
models can be applied for studying 
age-related DTI changes in a voxel-based 
analysis framework. These non-linear fitting 
models provided more detailed information 
regarding the agedependent alterations of 
global and regional diffusion characteristics 
in brain WM. In particular, we also showed 
that the age factor can play a more prominent 
role for the MD and eigenvalues than the FA 
measure.
