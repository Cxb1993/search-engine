The Flight Stability Control of a Flapping MAV
F.Y. Hsiao∗
Abstract— The trajectory control of flapping-wing micro-
aerial vehicles (MAVs) is discussed in this report. The Tamkang
University (TKU) has been devoted to the development of
flapping-wing robots for a long period, including design, fabri-
cation and control. On the basis of the earlier knowledge on the
Golden Snitch, a flapping-wing MAV in TKU, we stabilize the
flight trajectory with a modified P-control. Different from other
mechanical or aerial systems, the selections in control signal
are limited in this problem due to the restrictions in carry-on
weight. Numerical simulations also provided to demonstrate the
robustness of our control law, and flight test will be scheduled
to examine this design. The ultimate goal of this work is to
realize the autonomous flight of flapping-wing MAVs.

I. INTRODUCTION
This report studies the trajectory control of a flapping-
wing MAV, especially the MAV developed in the Tamkang
University. Flight in flapping is a very efficient way to
transport a unit of mass over a unit of distance, even though
it requires extremely high power output [8]. For this reason,
it is an interesting field and a new generation technology for
the researchers to investigate.
The TKU MEMS Laboratory has been developing bird-
like flapping MAVs for several years, and the most recent
prototype, “Golden Snitch”, is a 8-gram-weight and 20-cm-
wingspan aircraft including the fuselage, flapping wings, tail
wing, battery, motor and a set of gear system. The flapping
wing is driven by a motor with a four-bar linkage system.
By adjusting the lengths of the four bars, various stroke
angles can be designed. the stroke angle of Golden Snitch is
designed around 53◦. [4].
Researchers have been devoted themselves into the de-
velopment of flapping-wing MAVs. Many theories about
dynamics and control laws are come up with. Lighthill [7]
performed some of the earliest theoretical studies on the
aerodynamics of insect flight and Weis-Fogh and Jensen [11]
determined the variation of the positional angle of fore and
hind wings during flight of Schistocerca gregaria. A variety
of experimental studies has enabled a better understanding
of the nature of wing articulation by insects in hover and
forward flight [3], [10], [12]. Moreover, several modeling
and control laws are also proposed by researchers [1], [2],
[5], [6], [9].
In this research, we investigate the trajectory control of
flapping MAV. Although some researchers have been inves-
tigating this problems with application of various control

versity, Tamsui 251, Taiwan, ROC fyhsiao@mail.tku.edu.tw
theories, most of the results are not implementable in the
current days. To implement those control law we requires
powerful onboard computer and various sensors. However,
these equipments are hardly possible to carry onboard, due
to the limitation of size and weight. Consequently, we don’t
intend to propose a new or fascinating control law in this
report. Instead, we focus on the practical problems about
how to implement the control law and realize autonomous
flight of the flapping MAV under current technology level.
In detail, taking the Golden Snitch as the example, we
derive the equations of motion and obtain those dynamical
coefficients with experimental data. To solve the weight
problem, we select a commercial IR transmission module,
which unfortunately constrains our control ability. We also
propose an non-intrusive method, using stereo-vision, to
obtain the position and attitude of the flapping-wing vehicle.
Based on the current hardware that we can construct, a P-
control with modified output feedback algorithm is proposed,
and numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the
robustness of our algorithm.
II. DYNAMICS MODEL
The flapping-wing MAV developed by the MEMS Labora-
tory in the Tamkang University, the Golden Snitch, is shown
in 1, and its full nonlinear dynamics of this vehicle has been
discussed in Ref. [14], provided the coordinate definition
shown in Figs. 2 and 3.
In this report, however, we only consider the dynamics
in the vertical motion with focus on the implementation
of trajectory control law. Although realizing autonomous
flight is the ultimate goal, in the current stage we are
under the constraint of mechanisms, leading to the limited
operation capability in flapping frequency and null ability in
direction and attitude controls. As a consequence, this report
mainly discuss the control law and implementation in vertical
motion, and put the direction and attitude controls in future
schedule.

University.

infrared (IR) communication module (less than 1 grams)
onboard, and keep the total weight of the vehicle under
10 gram. If the traditional architecture were to applied, the
lightest RF communication module, including encoder and
decoder, is ∼3 g, and the MEMS gyro is ∼30 g. These are
definitely too heavy to apply, much less onboard computer
or control chips.
A modified architecture is designed in this research, de-
picted in Fig. 5. As mentioned previously, the traditional RF
communication module is replaced by a 1-gram IR module,
and we developed an alternative navigation methodology
using stereo vision. The guidance and control signal are
accomplished and in the ground station, instead of onboard
computer. As a result, we don’t equip any onboard control
unit in this research. This structure indeed confines the flight
capability and applicability of the flapping-wing MAV, but
it is the easiest and the only way to realize the autonomous
flight nowadays.
B. The Communication Module of Golden Snitch
As mentioned earlier the limitation of carry-on weight
makes us select a specific commercial infrared communi-
cation module, which transmits signals in three channels,
potentially applicable to control of the thrust, the direction,
and the mode.
In channel one, 14 levels of signals are designated and
applied to thrust control, corresponding to 14 spin rates of the
driving motor, which drives the main wing through a four-
bar linkage [4]. As a result, the 14 levels of signals generate
thrusts through modifying the flapping frequencies. The
relation between the thrust level and the flapping frequency
is given in Table III. On the other hand, 6 levels of signals
are are designated and reserved for future direction control.
3 levels of command can be assigned in each direction (right
or left). Finally, one of three modes can be selected so that
signals will not interfere with each other if more than one
bird are flying.
Due to the constraint of the communication module, a
regular state feedback or output feedback is not feasible since
the control signal cannot be simply proportional to the state
or output. A different control law must be investigated.

IV. CONTROL LAW DESIGN
As stated previously this research mainly focuses on how
the control law can be implemented in our robotic bird.
Accordingly, a complicated control law is unrealistic since
we only have limited choices in control signals. Therefore,
the traditional P-control is investigated and shown robustness
in practical implementation.
A. Linearized Dynamics
The nonlinear dynamics describing the altitude of the
vehicle is given in Eq. (1). Assume that the vehicle is original
in the cruise condition: z = z0, z˙ = 0, U = U0, and f = f0.
Moreover, assume that the pitch angle of the fuselage is Θ,
as shown in Fig. 6(a). When in cruise condition, Θ = Θ0.
We conclude that the set angle for the main wing and angle
of attack the tail are approximately αw = Θ0 + cw and
αt = Θ0 + ct, respectively. Here, cw and ct are certain
constant, depending on the installation angle of the wings.
Moreover, if the vehicle moves upward with a vertical speed

as shown in Fig. 6(b).
To apply the P-control, we first linearize the dynamics
about the cruise condition, given by
δFw + δFt = mδz¨ (7)
Consider the perturbation of the force generated by the main
wing. Eqs. (2) and (4) indicate that the force is a function
of U , ζ, η, ξ, and J . Additionally, J itself is a function of
flapping frequency f , and {ζ, η, ξ} are functions of set angle
Θ. Therefore, we can write
Fw = Fw(U, ζ, η, ξ, f)
The perturbation is then given by

VI. CONCLUSION
In this report we investigate a potential control law to
stabilize our particular flapping-wing MAV developed in
Tamkang University. At beginning we briefly review the
required dynamics for the trajectory control. Wind tunnel ex-
periments are also done to obtain physical and aerodynamical
parameters and coefficients. We then introduce the hardware
which is to be applied to the control of flight trajectory,
especially focusing on the altitude control. Considering the
capability limit of an MAV in carrying weight, we modify
the control architecture so that automatic control of flight
trajectory is possible using current technology, accomplished
by a specific IR communication module and stereo vision.
However, this modification also brings constraints to the
usage of control law. Taking the constraint into account, we
analytically prove that the traditional P-control with modified
output feedback works very well in this case. Numerical
simulations are also provided to demonstrate the robustness
of our control law. Flight test will be the next step to examine
this design after the hardware of the whole control loop is
finished.

Polarization of a radiated wave is defined as the 
property of an electromagnetic wave describing the

electric-field vector.  The polarization of an antenna 
in a given direction is defined as the polarization of 
the wave transmitted by the antenna.  The sense of 
rotation for circular polarization (CP) is determined 
by observing the field rotation as the wave is viewed 
as it travels away from the observer.  If the rotation 
is clockwise, the wave is right-hand circularly 
polarized (RHCP); if the rotation is counterclockwise, 
the wave is left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP).  
Circular polarization with only one feed can be 
achieved by a square patch with two truncated 
opposite corners as shown in Fig.2.  The square 
patch is fed at the center of one of its side, and the 
antenna is fed along a center line as with a linear 
polarized patch.  Right- or left-hand circular 
polarization depends on the location of the feed. 
 
3. Design of Microstrip Antenna on 2D Isotropic 
Substrates 
Analyses of square and rectangular patches on an 
isotropic substrate can be completed by using 
Eqs.(1-9).  Ansoft Ensemble® is employed to 
simulate the microstrip patch on an isotropic substrate.  
Consider the microstrip patch on some FR4 substrate 
(e.g. , ) operating at 2.40 GHz, 
the geometry can be calculated as L = 29.70 mm and 
Δa = 2.42 mm.  For a small section of 100-ohm feed 
line and a quarter-wave transformer attached to the 
corner-truncated CP patch, Fig.3(a) shows the 
dimension of this example, and the return loss is 
shown in Fig.3(b).  The impedance bandwidth of 
10dB is about 3% of the operating frequency.  The 
return loss, i.e., the scatter parameter S
7.4=rε mmd  6.1=
11 that describes 
the relation between incident and reflected power for 
microstrip patch, can be validated by treating the 
patch as a one-port element.  The measurement of 
the return loss by network analyzer (e.g. Agilent 
EB362B) in Fig.3(b) is in good agreement with the 
simulation.  Figure 3(c) is the far field pattern of 
electric field (E-field) operating at 2.40 GHz.  The 
performance of RHCP feed is better than LHCP’s 
because the maximum of LHCP E-field components is 
only about -10 dB of RHCP’s.  The patch is indeed 
suitable as an RHCP antenna. 
 
4. Design of Meander-line Antenna on 2D Isotropic 
Substrates 
Consider the prototype of meander-line antenna 
in Fig.4(a) on some isotropic FR4 substrate with finite 
ground plane ( mmmm 5.221 × ) operating at 2.40 GHz, 
Fig.4(b) shows the simulation of return loss curve 
where the impedance bandwidth of 10dB is about 
4.5% of the operating frequency.  Figure 4(c) is the 
simulation of far field pattern of this example, the 
bold line is the H-plane diagram and the solid line is 
the E-plane diagram, respectively.  This results show 
that the meander-line antenna in Fig.4(a) has the 
characteristic of omindirectional pattern in the upper 
and lower planes of the isotropic FR4 substrate.  The 
far field pattern of H-field is less than that one of 
E-field due to the effect of instrinsic impedance.  The 
measurements of the return loss by network analyzer 
(Anritsu 37347C) in Fig.4(d) and the far field pattern 
by anechoic chamber NSI 2000 in Fig.4(e) are in good 
agreement with the simulations of Figs.4(b) and 4(c), 
respectively.  However, the design of meander-line 
antenna in Fig.4(a) does not give a good gain to meet 
the demands of wireless communication, so it is 
necessary to have a better design for flapping-MAV. 
This research adopts better design for the

Dynamics of Flapping Micro-Aerial Vehicles
T.M. Yang and F.Y. Hsiao
Abstract— The dynamics of flapping wing micro aerial vehi-
cles (MAVs) is studied in this paper. The MEMS Laboratory in
Tamkang University has been developing flapping-wing MAVs
for several years. Based on the developed flapping-wing MAVs
we study its dynamics and compare our results with flight test
data. Although several papers have discussed similar topics
previously, using our flight test data we demonstrate the validity
of the assumptions and derivations. We also propose a claim
that links the average aerodynamical forces to the wind tunnel
test data, so that a flapping MAV can be analyzed with the same
methodology as what we have done to a fixed-wing aircraft.
Flight test data and numerical simulations are also provided to
demonstrate the validity of our derivation.
I. INTRODUCTION
Flight in flapping is a very efficient way to transport
a unit of mass over a unit of distance, even thouth it
requires extremely high power output[5]. For this reason,
it is an interesting field and a new generation technology
for the flight configuration. There are two kinds of flight
configuration that is investigated in the literatures on natural
flapping flight: Bird-like flight and Insect-like flight. The
focus of this paper is on bird-like flight. The bird-like aerial
robot we are investigating is developed by the TKU MEMS
LAB in the recent years.
The TKU MEMS Laboratory has been developing bird-
like flapping MAVs for several years. Figure 1 demonstrates
the most recent prototype, “Golden Snitch”, which is a
7-gram-weight and 20-cm-wingspan aircraft including the
fuselage, flapping wings, tail wing, battery, motor and a set
of gear system. The flapping wing is driven by a motor with
a four-bar linkage system. By adjusting the lengths of the
four bars, various stroke angles can be designed. In Golden
Snitch the stroke angle is designed around 53◦. [2].
The aerodynamics performance in flapping animals con-
sists of delayed stall, rotational circulation and wake cap-
ture [10]. These phenomenon and their functions can be
explained by experiments and theories. However, complete
and exact analysis of the flapping flight is not available
because of the aerodynamic and mechanical complexity. As
a result, In Ref. [4] Kim developed a smart flapping wing
with a macro-fiber compositers (MFC) actuator to mimic
the flying mechanism to measure the aerodynamic forces of
flapping devices in wind tunnel test. Furthermore, In Ref. [7]

MAV, Zaeem built a longitudinal flight dynamics with time-
average theory [3], but only in 2-dimension space. In this
paper, we intend to develop the three-dimensional model
which will then be compared with the real trajectory.
In this research, we investigate the dynamic model of flap-
ping MAV. Starting from Newton’s second law we develop
the equations of motion of our flapping-wing robot. Due to
the fast flapping frequency compared with the translational
and rotational rates, the average lift and thrust forces over
each flapping period are applied to this model. Numerical
simulations are also provided to examine the validity of our
model and selected parameters.

pointing in the direction of the right wing. The zb-axis then
points downward in the MAV plane of symmetry, completing
the right-handed Cartesian system. In addition, the coordi-

average force during the upstroke is given by

where C′L(J) = C′Ld(J) + C

(J). We can see that the
average force has the same formulation as Eqs. (6) and (7).
We would admit that this is not a rigorous proof because
many aerodynamics factors are not considered, such as the
stability of the air flow, the flexibility of the wing and so on.
However, at least this proof gives a qualitative link between
the average force used in the dynamics field and the most
common way to formulate flapping lift and trust forces in
the aerodynamics field. In other words, if we have the lift
and thrust coefficient curves at hand, which are usually easy
to obtain in aerodynamics journals, we can simply apply the
same methodology of analyzing a fixed-wing vehicle to the
analysis of a flapping-wing robot.
C. Formulation of Forces and Moments
Having shown that the average forces over one flapping
period can be calculated by using Eqs. (6) and (7), which is
independent of time, we conclude that the methodology to
analyze a fixed wing vehicle can be applied to the flapping
wing vehicle. There are only two differences. First of all,
the force coefficients CL and CT are no longer functions
of angle of attack only, but also functions of advance ratio.
Second, when applied to analyze the dynamics of the whole
vehicle, we don’t use angle of attack since it is not rigorously
defined in flapping motion. Instead, the set angle and stroke
angle are introduced.
Figures. 5(a) and (b) provide the distribution of aerody-
namics forces on the wing. As a result, provided Eqs. (6)
and (7) Fxb and Fzb can be obtained by considering the
vector addition of the lift and thrust forces.
Fzbwing = Fthrust sin(α)− Flift cos(α) (13)
Fxbwing = Fthrust cos(α) + Flift sin(α) (14)
where α is set angle of MAV.

On the other hand, the moments exerted on the MAV can
be obtained through summing up all individual moment and
torque. All the necessary geometric parameters to calculate
moments are shown in Fig. 6. In addition to the regular
formulation of moments, one thing to remind again is that we
have to consider the torque applied by the motor, τ = τmotor
pointing along +xb-axis because our motor spins clockwise.
Applying the formulated forces and moments to Eqs. (3)-(4)
we can solve for the position, velocity and attitude of the
MAV.

B. Numerical Simulation
1) Attitude Equilibria at Cruise Flight: At cruise flight
the MAV must be in the equilibria of its attitude. According
to our model, we obtain that the pitch angle at cruise flight
must be 12◦. Examining Fig. 3 we realize that the Golden
Snitch flies at the angle of 15◦. This is encouraging since
our prediction is quite close to the reality. However, this fact
also implies that the predicted lift force at wing tail may be
too large so that the pitch angle is smaller than the real one.
2) Simulated Flight Trajectories: Besides encouraging
result in the match of derived and actual attitude equilib-
ria, three dynamical cases are also simulated, provided in
Figs. 13- 15. In the first case, shown in Fig. 13, we use the
derived parameters from the previous chapter but neglect the
torque made by the motor. The simulated flight trajectory
forms a circle. In the second case we reduce the coefficients
