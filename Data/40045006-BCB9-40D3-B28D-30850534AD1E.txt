英文摘要 
In this work, we have developed a novel 
double patterning technique utilizing an i-line 
stepper for the formation of sub-100nm gate 
patterns and implemented this technique to the 
fabrication of devices. This technique consists of 
2-step lithography and following etch process to 
form the gate patterns. Reward for the 
complicated process steps is the shrinkage of 
resulted patterns beyond the resolution limit of 
the conventional i-line lithographic method 
(~0.3μm), since this technique doesn’t suffer the 
diffraction effect encountered in conventional 
process. Resolution capability of this technique 
has been confirmed to improve at least to 100nm 
in this thesis. Asymmetrical source/drain 
structure, such as tunneling field-effect 
transistors (TFETs), was fabricated with this 
technique and characterized in this work. 
 
Keywords: lithography, double patterning, 
resolution enhancement, tunneling FET. 
二、計畫的緣由與目的 
The well-known Moore’s Law states that 
the number of transistors on an integrated circuit 
(IC) chip will double every 18 months [1]. Since 
the advent of IC manufacturing, this law has 
been in force for decades. In order to keep up 
with the Moore’s Law, shrinkage in device 
dimensions is indispensable, which also 
promotes device density, operation speed, and 
chip functionality. In other words, for better 
performance and cheaper manufacturing cost, 
the continuous scaling of the devices is evitable. 
To keep pace with the law, it requires innovation 
to overcome several fundamental physical 
barriers lying ahead, and first of all is to extend 
the photolithography limit. According to the 
Rayleigh’s criterion, the resolution, R, of a 
photolithography technique can be expressed as 
follows [2]:  
 2
After the generation of the first PR patterns, the 
regions of exposed poly-Si layer were etched 
away with a reactive plasma step, as shown in 
Fig. 1 (b). After the first PR removal, the next 
lithographic step was employed to generate the 
second PR patterns which covered portions of 
the poly-Si layer remaining on the surface of the 
substrate, followed by a reactive plasma etching 
step to complete the final poly-Si structure [Fig. 
1 (c)]. With suitable design and process control, 
the dimension of final poly-Si line patterns [Fig. 
1 (d)] could be scaled well below 100 nm. Both 
in-line and cross-sectional scanned electron 
microscopic (SEM) techniques were used to 
characterize and verify the resultant PR and 
etched poly-Si structures.  
B: Device fabrication of pMOSFETs  
PMOSFETs were fabricated on 6-inch 
n-type Si wafers with conventional local 
oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) isolation. Thermal 
gate oxide of about 3 nm was subsequently 
grown in an N2O ambient, followed by the 
deposition of 200 nm undoped poly-Si and gate 
implantation (BF2+, 10 keV, 5×1015cm-2). 
Afterwards a LPCVD tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) 
oxide of 50 nm was deposited to serve a hard 
mask layer, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). After gate 
definition using the DP method (Fig. 1) as shown 
in figs. 2 (b) and 2 (c), shallow source/drain (S/D) 
extension regions were formed by implanting 
BF2+ (10 keV, 5×1014cm-2), as shown in Fig. 2 
(d). After forming a 100 nm TEOS sidewall 
spacer, deep S/D junctions were formed by 
implanting BF2+ (15 keV, 5×1015cm-2), and then 
annealed at 1000 ℃ for 5 seconds as shown in 
Fig. 2 (e). Finally, a conventional AlSiCu 
metallization was carried out to form the metal 
pads (Fig. 2 (f)). Electrical characterizations 
were performed using an HP 4156 system. 
C: Device fabrication of TFETs 
TFETs were fabricated on 6-inch p-type Si 
wafers with conventional local oxidation of 
silicon (LOCOS) isolation without 
anti-punchthrough or threshold voltage (Vth) 
adjustment implant. 2.5 nm N2O thermal gate 
oxide and 100nm in-situ n-doped poly-Si were 
formed by vertical furnaces. After gate definition 
using the DP method, n-type drain formation 
was performed with As+ implantation at 10 keV 
and 5x1014 cm-2. A BF2+ implantation (10 keV 
and 1x1015 cm-2) was used to form the p-type 
source. A 1000 ℃ spike rapid thermal anneal 
(Spike RTA) was subsequently applied for 
dopant activation. Finally, a conventional 
AlSiCu metallization was carried out to form the 
metal pads. 
研究成果 
A: Feasibility of the DP process 
In-line SEM images of several etched 
poly-Si structures with the designed pattern 
width of 100 nm are shown in Fig. 3. These 
images were taken from different locations of a 
six-inch Si wafer. The range of the measured 
pattern width is distributed from 96 to 106 nm in 
Fig. 3. These results confirm the feasibility of 
the DP method for forming structures having 
dimension as small as 100 nm with an I-line 
stepper. However, we found the fluctuation in 
the measured line width of the patterned poly-Si 
structures becomes large as the nominal width is 
smaller than 100 nm. Such finding is reasonable 
when considering the overlay limit of the 
exposure system which is 45 nm. Since the 
dimension of the patterned lines is determined 
by the overlap region of the two gate masks, the 
 4
design, we believe the necking issue mentioned 
above will be settled completely for the sub-100 
nm device fabrication. These results clearly 
evidence the usefulness of the proposed I-line 
DP technique for nano-scale device fabrication 
and study. In addition, TFETs with on/off ratio 
of around 4~5 orders in magnitude was achieved, 
and the minimum SS was about 230~260 
mV/dec. The poor SS characteristics was 
ascribed to non-abrupt dopant profile.
