Abstract 
Surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices have the advantages of compact, superior performance, high 
reproduction and excellent reliability. Owing to the improvement in design and fabrication techniques, SAW 
devices have been widely used in products of communication, computer and consumer electronics. 
Multi-layer piezoelectric thin-film substrates which may present properties of good temperature characteristic, 
high reflectivity, high coupling coefficient, high phase velocity, and integratible with semiconductor, has the 
potential to replace single crystal piezoelectric substrates used on acoustic devices. The properties of 
piezoelectric thin-film substrate are determined by the structure of the substrate, the piezoelectric material, the 
metal film thickness, etc., the parameters of material not readily obtainable from literature. Hence, this project 
is focused on establishing the capability to analyze the properties of multi-layer piezoelectric thin-film 
substrates. The research data of this project would be applied to design high frequency RF acoustic devices 
such as resonator and filters.

一、 前言及研究背景與目的 
早期聲波元件受制於激發的效能，以塊體波(bulk acoustic wave, BAW)模態為主，其操作頻率由基
板厚度決定，僅能達到數十MHz。直到 1965 年，加州大學教授 R. M. White 和 F. W. Voltmer 發展出
指叉換能器(interdigital transducer, IDT)製作於壓電基板(piezoelectric substrate)表面上，成功的激發了表
面聲波(surface acoustic wave, SAW)[1]。由於 SAW 的操作頻率是由 IDT 的週期所決定，且製程技術與
半導體相近，因此聲波元件的操作頻率可大幅提升至 GHz範圍，使得相關的研究也因而活絡起來[2-4]。
由於聲波之波傳速度只有電磁波的 10-5，若在相同操作頻率時，其體積可以比其他微波元件，如：微
帶線濾波器或 RLC 濾波器，更有效的縮小尺寸，達到輕薄短小的目標；再加上 SAW 元件之頻率響應
特性極佳，可靠度高，複製性高，以及設計與封裝技術的持續開發、改良，產品製造技術的不斷進步，
因此 SAW 元件被廣泛的應用於各種通訊(Communication)、電腦(Computer)以及消費性(Consumer)電子
等 3C 產品上。 
表面聲波元件的工作原理係於壓電基板上以半導體或微機電的製程技術製作指叉換能器，利用加
於指叉換能器之電訊號，因逆壓電效應激發不同模態之聲波，傳遞於基板上；同樣地，指叉換能器因
正壓電效應將基板之聲波還原成電訊號。可藉由設計不同結構之指叉換能器因其具有不同之頻率響應
來實現濾波器以及共振器等常用的通訊元件。一般而言，不同頻率響應之聲波元件必須選用的不同特
性之壓電基板，例如：窄頻聲波元件通常選用具有良好的溫度係數與低機電耦合係數之壓電基板，如：

進行結構之模擬。COMSOL Multiphysic 軟體在模擬設定上可分為頻率響應分析與暫態之時域分析。在
壓電層之輸入參數為彈性矩陣、耦合矩陣、介電常數矩陣、以及密度等。非壓電層之輸入參數為楊氏
模數、密度以及熱膨脹係數等。輸出之物理量主要為位移(Displacement)、形變(Deformation)、應力(Strain 
& Stress)、電核密度(Charge Density)、電位能(Voltage Potential)等。探討壓電薄膜壓電基板特性上將著
重於薄膜厚度，薄膜材料、金屬電極厚度、金屬電極材料等參數對機電耦合係數、衰減常數、溫度係
數以及波速等參數的影響，以求找出適合製作表面聲波元件之基板結構。

二、與會心得 
近幾年本人多次參加大陸舉辦的 IEEE的會議，此次會議，在論文數目、參與人數以及部分論文品
質亦相當不錯。然而，主辦單位為對參與人員的安排似乎有欠經驗，諸如會議議程說明書不夠完整（未
能列出壁報論文）、口頭報告的場次過少、壁報論文場地過於擁擠以及對參與之學者未能有效的約束，
以致許多壁報論文作者為出席會場等，給我的感覺像是內陸版學術大拜拜，提供一個可以發表具國際
頭銜會議的機會。當然，個人在許多的國際會議中亦見過頗多類似的情形，部分論文之作者（特別是
以研究生出席）畏懼在國際場合上以英語發表論文，故採取逃避的方式。此類行為不但不尊重主辦大
會，更破壞自己學校的聲譽，如何規範此種不當的行為，確是身為教育工作者的我們當思考的問題。
其實，參加國際會議的目的不僅僅是發表個人研究成果、與其他學者交換經驗以及找尋研究標的等，
提高台灣能見度也是目的之一。個人認為，特別是參加彼岸的國際會議，更應該表現出認真的態度，
留給大陸的學者對台灣教育與研究方面一個嚴謹的印象。 
三、建議 
近年大陸因經濟發展迅速，在國家支持下，各地大學都積極舉辦各型國際級的學術研討會，其數
量與規模有急速上升的趨勢，大大的提昇中國大陸在國際間的學術地位。相對於國內，政府對學
術單位主辦國際會議之支持卻似乎不及以往。因此，建議政府主管部門能積極鼓勵國內各大學與
研究機構多主動爭取舉辦類似此國際性質之學術會議，並給與大力之支持以提昇本國學術在國際
間的地位。為吸引國外學者專家參加，應可試著與國際性組織，如 IEEE、IET、IFSA、IASTED等
聯絡，爭取年度性之會議於台灣舉行，擴大外國學者到台灣之機會，以便其了解台灣教育與研究
的狀況。

Abstract—In this paper, a new extraction method is developed 
for creating a very wide band, from 2 to 85 GHZ, small-signal 
model for interdigitated, low noise, pseudomorphic high electron 
mobility transistor (pHEMT).  By applying the scalability nature 
of transistor, a physically related small-signal model is obtained 
through curve-fitting optimization.  This new extraction method 
also eliminates the need of a de-embedding procedure.

I. INTRODUCTION 
mall-signal models are used in many areas.  For example, 
when designing a MMIC (Monolithic Microwave 
Integrated Circuit) chip at millimeter wave frequencies, a 
small-signal model along with other measured data, such as 
load-pull impedance, noise-match impedance, …,etc., are 
preferred in the project design rather than using the large-signal 
model since the large-signal model tends to provide inaccurate 
simulation results at these frequency ranges.  Not only that, an 
accurate small-signal model is usually used in the 
characterization of the fabrication process to investigate the 
characteristics of device physics.  Furthermore, bias-dependent 
small-signal models are used to construct large-signal models 
[1], which even enhance the importance of small-signal 
models. 
All the applications mentioned above need an accurate and 
wide-band small-signal model.  To extract the circuit 
parameters of the small-signal model from measured 
S-parameters has many approaches.  A direct determination 
based on analytical equation [2-10] is one of the approaches. 
This type of approach applies measured S-parameters with 
different biased conditions from a single FET (Field Effect 
Transistor) and then calculates intrinsic and extrinsic 
parameters directly.  It has the problem of choosing the proper 
parameter’s value because the computed values would vary 
with frequency.  The curve-fitting process is usually needed in 
the final step to achieve a good small-signal model.  Besides, 
the choice of the starting values for circuit elements would 
affect the outcomes of the fitting process, which may result in a 
local minimum, non-physical related model, since it is already 
known that the parameter extraction from a single set of 
S-parameter has the problem of choosing the initial value and 
non-unique solution [16].  Recently, research trend is more 
toward the algorithm development for the optimizer in order to 
overcome the non-unique problem by eliminating, to a high 
extent, the local minimum solutions [11-15].  These methods 
are based on the multi-bias data-fitting approach and also 
require a set of multi-bias S-parameters, measured from a 
single transistor, in order to extract the common 15-elements 
small-signal equivalent model.  All these methods share a 
common feature, which is to treat the extrinsic circuit elements 
as bias-independent variables while the intrinsic elements as 
bias-dependent and then curve-fitting with a set of multi-bias 
S-parameters measured from a single transistor. 
It is not easy to have a single set of small-signal model to fit 
the measured S-parameters accurately for very wide-band 
frequencies.  In the published papers, the very wide-band 
measured data was usually divided into several sub-frequency 
ranges and the measured whole frequency data were modeled 
by more than one set of small-signal model separately.  This 
causes the confusion that which model’s circuit parameter 
would more truly reflect the physical properties of the target 
transistor.  To the author’s best knowledge, the widest 
frequency range, valid for a small-signal model that was ever 
published, is in Shirakawa’s paper [11].  By letting intrinsic 
elements be described as functions of extrinsic elements, he 
shows that the extracted circuit parameters are nearly 
frequency-independent from 0.5 to 62.5 GHz.  In this paper, we 
propose a completely different approach to extract the 
small-signal model and the results demonstrate that the 
generated model is successfully valid from 2 to 85 GHz.  
Unlike the use of multi-bias S-parameters measured from a 
single transistor, our proposed approach relies on the 
S-parameters measured from several different sizes of FET and 
with each being biased at the same percentage current level of 
IDSS.  Based on the scaling nature of FET and the new 
introduction of Δd, the optimizer compare several sets of 
simulated (generated from the circuit in Figure 1) and measured 
S-parameters simultaneously.  A small-signal model of targeted 
FET is then achieved.  Due to the use of the equivalent circuit, 
as shown in Figure 1, for curve-fitting process, the traditional 
de-embedding procedure is not needed in this new method.  As 
a result, work is also saved.  In the end, a very wide-band, 
physically related small-signal model with frequencies from 2 
to 85 GHz is achieved and presented in this paper.  Verification 
of the model’s validity is also tested and presented.  
II. METHOD DESCRIPTION  
    Three different sizes of the pHEMT FET device, 160μm 
(4×40), 240μm (6×40), 500μm (10×50), with ft (unit current 
gain frequencies) more than 90 GHz, are used in this paper for 
extracting the particular 240μm FET’s circuit parameters.  To 
suit for our proposed approach, dimensions and layout 
structures of the input as well as the output transmission line,

 as dependent variable αCPG, since CPG is mainly composed of 
the coupling capacitance caused from the gate metal to the 
cross grounded metal-strip which is used to connect the two 
via (Figure 2).  So the value of CPG is approximately 
proportional to gate-finger counts and is larger than the value 
CPD since there is no cross ground-strip on the drain side.  Due 
to complex metal structures of FET, it is even difficult enough 
to determine the extrinsic inductances [15].  The extrinsic LG, 
LD, LS of all FET remain as separate independent variables.  
The element RD1 of FET1 is set as the dependent variable RD/
β .  RD is supposed to be composed of the conduction 
resistance of the drain metal and its ohmic contact resistance.  
The resistance values should be very small, but in our results 
(Table I), it shows around 4Ω of RD (Large non-physical 
values of RD are also found and discussed in Niekerk’s Paper 
[15]).  The causes of large RD are not clear now. We think it 
may be either from the effects of Δd, or the traditional parallel 
RC circuits (RDS and CDS) could not completely model the 
behavior of transistor’s conduction channel for a very wide 
frequency range.  An additional very small resister in series 
with the original parallel RC circuit seems to be the better 
modeling-circuits.  This small resister is either absorbed to RD 
or RDS, depending on the ranges of the frequency during 
parameters extraction.  The element RS1 of FET1 is set as the 
dependent variable RS/γ.  RS is composed of the conduction 
resistance of source metal and its ohmic contact resistance.  
The value of RS is small and is inversely proportional to the 
total size of FET, approximately.  Finally, the element RG1 of 
FET1 is set as the dependent variable βRG/α.  Extrinsic gate 
resistance RG is composed from the gate-metal’s Schottky 
contact resistance as well as the conduction resistance.  Since 
the gate metal is very thin, the contribution to RG from the 
conduction resistance is more than from the contact resistance.  
In that case, the value of RG is proportional to the gate length 
but inversely proportional to the gate-finger counts, 
approximately.  Even if the contact resistance becomes 
significant, it can be absorbed to Ri. 
Due to the scalability is in FET’s nature and by applying 
this nature as the principle for searching the proper 
small-signal model, this new method should give a unique 
solution, which would truly reflect the real physical properties 
of the transistor. 
III. EXPERIMENT 
Based on the above theory, select the model of 240μm FET 
as the target model and viewing the models of 160μm and 
500μm FET as the auxiliary models.  Set up the circuit 
parameters of Figure 1 for all three FET as described above.  
Then, apply the optimization process to simultaneously 
curve-fit with each corresponding measured S-parameters.  No 
specific initial values are necessary for this optimization 
process.  
 Figures 3 to 6 show the comparisons between measured 
and simulation results. A very good match in S-parameters are 
obtained for every FET from 2 to 85 GHz, even for the 
S12-curves, which have very distinctive features for different 
FETs.  Figure 7 and 8 show the comparisons of phase (240μm 
FET) in order to make sure no significant phase-shift exists.  
The extracted circuit parameters of 240μm FET are shown in 
TABLE I on the second column under the heading of “Base 
Method”.  Independent parameters, LG, LD, LS, which are used 
without any scaling rule during curve-fitting process, are also 
recorded there. 
 Instead of using three sets of S-parameters for model 
extraction, two sets of measured S-parameters are used for 
investigation.  Those results are also shown in TABLE I for 
both comparison and investigation purposes.  The third 
column, under the heading of “A method”, is to use 160μm 
FET only as the auxiliary model.  “B method”, the fourth 
column, is to use 500μm FET only as the auxiliary model.  
Average and percentage of deviation are also shown in 
TABLE I.  The percentage of deviation is calculated according 
the following equation: 
∑
=

1%100  (1) 
Judging from the results in TABLE I, the deviation level of 
Δd is pretty small, indicating the validity of introducing Δd.  
The deviation levels for most elements are also low.  However, 
it shows that a high level of deviation happened on CPD, RS, LG, 
LD, and Ri.  Ri is the only intrinsic element with a high level of 
deviation because of its high sensitivity [17-18] and very small 
in value.  Resistance Ri is a notoriously unstable parameter 
when determined numerically from the measured S-parameter.  
But, on the other hand, since it is small in value with very high 
sensitivity, inaccurate Ri makes little impacts on applications 
of small-signal model because very little errors would be 
created in the S-parameters due to its inaccuracy Although the 
sensitivities of LG, LD, CPD, and RS are not discussed in those 
papers [17-18], they also contribute little errors to 
S-parameters because of their very small values.

I. CONCLUSION 
A very wide-band, from 2 to 85 GHz, and accurate 
small-signal model is achieved in this paper with a new 
extraction method.  This new method saves the traditional 
de-embedded procedure and directly curve-fits with the 
measured data.  The small-signal model developed by this new 
method is unique and truly reflects the physical property of the 
transistor.  Very consistent values for the important model’s 
parameters, which have low sensitivity, are demonstrated in this 
paper.  Since the scale nature of FET is used to the maximum 
level for both intrinsic and extrinsic circuit elements, it will 
minimize the possibility of non-realistic solutions to be 
generated.

III. SIMULATIONS
In this study, the data of decoration film provided by 
Mildex Optical Inc. were analyzed and simulated. Table I is the 
example of data collected. The information of data includes the 
value of quartz crystal deposition monitor, the rotation speed of 
holder, the substrate position of panel placed, Cr thickness, 
Cr2O3 thickness and transmittance. The complex relationship 
between film’s transmittance and its possible influencing 
factors is expected to be obtained by NN model automatically. 
To fairly demonstrate the feasibility of NN model used, four 
different data sets named Set-1, Set-2, Set-3 and Set-4, were 
randomly organized from the original data base. For each data 
set, 100 points were used for network’s training and 44 points 
were used for testing. The mean absolute error (MAE) and the 
mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used as the 
measurements of performance.

In this research, several simulations were carried out by 
using different input sets. Tables II to V show the error 
statistics of the simulations by m-2-2-1 neural model with m
inputs. Fig. 2 to Fig. 5 present the superposition curves of 
estimations performed by neural model with five inputs for 
data Set-1 to Set-4. The solid line stands the actual 
transmittances and the dot line stands the estimations. From the 
simulation results shown, it is obviously found that a well-
trained NN indeed has the ability to estimate the transmittance 
according to the proper input variables.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, the transmittance estimator of TP decoration 
film with Cr and Cr2O3 coating by using neural network is 
presented. The NN model with quasi-Newton learning method 
was used to obtain the mapping between TP transmittance and 
its all possible influencing factors. From the simulation results 
shown, the performance of NN model with five inputs is best 
and its average MAPE can reach to around 1.98%. That means 
an AI decision mechanism for control parameters of TP 
evaporation process is possibly developed and it is quite 
promising for commercial using. Such an AI decision 
mechanism indeed can help the company to manufacture the 
high quality TP film that could meet the customer asked for. In 
this research, the transmittance estimation for TP film with two 
layers coating was studied. In our future works, the film with 
multi-layer coating will be continued.
