Abstract: 
A new operation scheme, namely dynamic body biases 
method is proposed for achieving low power and low noise 
design in RF CMOS circuits. However, the conventionally 
used RF CMOS models cannot be applied for adopting 
dynamic body biases due to the fact that they are established 
based on 2-port test structures and limited to 3-terminal (3T) 
MOSFETs. To solve the fundamental problem, 4-port test 
structures are mandatory to realize 4-terminal RF MOSFET 
characterization and model development, adapted to 
dynamic body biases scheme.  
In this project, two kinds of 4-port test structures, 
namely 4-GSG and 2-GSGSG were implemented for 
conducting 4T RF MOSFET model development. A 
comprehensive comparison in terms of I-V, C-V, and high 
frequency S-parameters (up to 40GHz) has been carried out 
between the 4-port test structures and traditional two-port 
(2-port) testers. Furthermore, an extensive calibration on 
BSIM-4 model was performed according to the I-V, C-V, 
and S-parameters measured from the 4T MOSFETs in 4-port 
test structures. Then the body biases effect on 4T RF 
MOSFETs characteristics was investigated based on a new 
body network model developed for 4T MOSFETs simulation. 
In this approach, the 4-port measurement and de-embedding 
can enable a direct and accurate extraction of 4T device 
parameters, which cannot be achieved by conventional 
2-port measurement. Also, an accurate port reduction 
method was derived for 2-port S-parameters extraction. The 
accuracy was justified by a close match with those extracted 
from 2-port measurement and de-embedding. Finally, a 
serious verification on the proposed body network model has 
been done simulation under various body biases and 
comparison with those from the default model in BSIM-4. 
The results prove that the new body network model can offer 
much more reliable and accurate simulation for 4T MOSFET 
under dynamic body biases. The mentioned achievements 
such as 4-port test structures and de-embedding method, port 
reduction method, and new body network model constitute 
an important foundation for 4T MOSFET design and 
modeling, and then facilitating RF CMOS circuit simulation 
for low power and low noise design.  
 
I. Introduction 
The advancement of CMOS technology into nanoscale 
has faced multiple limitations, such as geometry scaling, 
voltage scaling, dynamic range, noise, and power. Low 
power and low noise have been identified as the most 
challenging subjects in nanoscale device modeling and 
circuit design. In this project, novel operation methods 
adopting new bias schemes will be explored and developed 
to solve the limitations in CMOS device VT and VDD scaling. 
The ultimate goal is to realize ultra-low power toward 
micro-watt (μW) scale aimed for wireless and wearable 
electronics in e-health applications. Four terminal (4T) 
devices and 4-port test structure are the basic building block 
to implement new biasing schemes. A dynamic body biases 
method is proposed as one of the best approaches adapted to 
nanoscale CMOS device and circuit design in trade-off 
between the active and standby power. New circuit 
topologies for ultra-low power and low noise can be created 
on the RF/MS CMOS platform, with added features and 
freedom of DC/RF signal supply enabled by the four 
terminal unit devices.

II.2 Four-port De-embedding and Port Reduction 
Methods 
      In the following, two kinds of 4-port de-embedding 
and port reduction methods was derived and investigated. 
The first one is performed by 4-port de-embedding and 
followed by port reduction. The second one is carried out in 
the reversed sequence, i.e. port reduction prior to 4-port 
de-embedding. Note that port reduction is used to extract 
2-port S- or Y-parameters in a 2x2 matrix from 4-port S-or 
Y- parameters in a 4x4 matrix. Fig.3 presents the 2-port 
S-parameters from three different methods for a comparison. 
The results indicate that port reduction after 4-port 
de-embedding offers much better match with the original 
2-port characteristics and is proven as the correct one for 
port reduction.

III. Body bias effect and Modeling for DC I-V and AC 
Characteristics 
    Fig. 4 (a) and (b) demonstrate the threshold voltage VT 
and DIBL effect (Vds=0.1 and 1.2V) measured from 
multi-finger MOSFETs (WF/N=2µm/16, 1µm/32, 0.5µm/64, 
WFxN=32μm). In comparison with those under zero body 
bias (Vbs=0), VT is driven lower under forward body biases 
(Vbs > 0 for nMOS) whereas higher under reverse body 
biases (Vbs < 0 for nMOS). It is interesting to note that 
forward body biasing can help reduce DIBL effect while 
reverse body biasing makes it worse, as shown in Fig. 4(b). 
Fig. 5 (a) and (b) present the measured and simulated Id-Vgs 
and gm-Vgs under various body biases. A good agreement 
between the measurement and simulation over various Vbs 
justifies the calibration on the BSIM-4 model in terms of 
body effect in VT model, mobility model, CLM and DIBL 
effects, not only in strong inversion region but also in 
subthreshold region. The experimental results prove our 
proposal of dynamic body biases method and provide an 
important guideline for ultra-low power RF circuit design.

  The body bias effect on gate capacitances, such as Cgg, Cgs, 
Cgd, and Cgb measured from 4T MOSFETs under various Vbs, 
covering zero, forward, and reverse body biases are shown 
in Fig. 6. The results indicate an increase of all three gate 
capacitances Cgg, Cgs and Cgb under forward body biases, 
particularly significant in weak inversion region with lower 
Vgs. On the other hand, the reverse body biases lead to a 
variation in an opposite direction, i.e. the larger reverse body 
bias, the smaller gate capacitances.

    The Herschel Satellite is with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), one of the two very
    large sub-mm and Far Infra-red (FIR) astronomy projects that will come into operation at the 
    end of this decade. Herschel’s observational capabilities will address forefront questions in  
    astronomy including the formation of galaxies after the Big Bang and the creation of planetary  
    system around other stars. Herschel will be launched early 2009 with an Ariane-5 rocket, together
    with the Planck saterllite, the  first European mission that studies the Cosmic Microwave  
background. Herschel incorporates three scientific instruments (cameras and spectrometers) and 
one of them is HiFi, the Heterodyne instrument for the FIR. It is operating in the frequency range
from 480 to 1910 GHz, and its design is optimized for high resolution spectroscopy of interstellar
molecules, such as water vapor, and to make frequency scan over the entire frequency range. 
It makes use of newly developed RF technology, ranging from cryogenic low-noise amplifiers 
And superconducting mixers, W-band power amplifiers (PA), planar Schottky diode multipliers, 
To high frequency digital electronics.
