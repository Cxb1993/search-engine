2Abstract
In this work, the reliability of gate oxide with the thickness of 1.0~3.0 nm was investigated by using constant voltage
stress (CVS) and ramped voltage stress (RVS) methods. From the experimental data, a thinner SiO2 gate oxide has a higher
breakdown electrical field, implying that the intrinsic reliability is not the main concern as the gate oxide thickness is further
decreased. Moreover, the relationship between ramped voltage stress (RVS) and constant voltage stress (CVS) results are
established in this study. Accurate conversion from ramped voltage stress (RVS) to constant voltage stress (CVS) can also be
achieved, indicating that ramped voltage testing can be used to replace constant voltage tests, which is a fast and time-saving
method.

在本計劃中，我們藉由傳導式原子力顯微鏡的導電探針與裸露的氧化層直接接觸，以定電壓 (CVS)與步階電壓
(RVS) 的方式對氧化層施加應力，研究當閘極氧化層厚度(1.0~3.0 nm) 變薄時,對氧化層退化及崩潰特性以及對可靠性
的影響。研究的結果指出較薄的氧化層有較低的崩潰電壓，然而卻有較大之崩潰電場。因此，若施加相同之電場於不
同厚度的氧化層，厚度微縮並不會造成氧化層本質可靠度極大之影響。同時，在本計劃中，我們也建立了定電壓 (CVS)
與步階電壓 (RVS)應力測試結果之關連性，利用我們推導出之轉化關係模式，我們可以成功得將步階電壓應力所得知
之崩潰電壓轉化為於定電壓應力測試時之崩潰時間，對於閘極氧化層厚度在 1.0~3.0 nm 時，都可得到滿意的結果。因
此，步階電壓測試方式可提供一個既快速又準確的技術以取代耗時的定電壓應力測試。

Figure2. Typical I-V curves of ramped voltage stress for 1.0~3.0nm gate oxide.
Figure 3 shows ramped voltage breakdown distributions for 1.0~3.0 nm thick SiO2 with sample size of 30. The
distributions obey Weibull statistics for intrinsic gate oxide breakdown. The parameter of Weibull statistics for soft-breakdown
voltage and hard-breakdown voltage for SiO2 with various thicknesses are listed in Table I. The t63.2% and Weibull values is
decreased with decreasing SiO2 thickness. Additionally, t63.2% value is not linearly decreased with decreasing SiO2 thickness,
suggesting that thinner SiO2 gate oxide have a higher breakdown electrical field. This implies that if stressing at the same
electrical filed, the intrinsic reliability is not the main concern as the gate oxide thickness is further decreased due to a higher
breakdown electrical field. The values extracted from the breakdown distributions for thickness ranging from 1.0 nm to 3.0
nm are also decreased for soft-breakdown and hard-breakdown distributions. The trend is consistent with the percolation model
of oxide breakdown. However, these values are relatively higher. It is presumably due to a localized phenomenon using
nano-scale measurement in this study, not a average phenomenon.

The extrapolated power-law voltage exponent (n) values are also shown in Fig. 5. The n values are consistent with other
reports results. However, the n value is not constant, and is dependent of oxide thickness. The n value is slightly decreased with
decreasing gate oxide thickness. The exact mechanism of the decreasing n values is yet undetermined.

Conclusions
The reliability of gate oxide with the thickness of 1.0~3.0 nm was investigated by using constant voltage stress (CVS) and
ramped voltage stress (RVS) methods. From the experimental data, a thinner SiO2 gate oxide has a higher breakdown electrical
field. This implies that the intrinsic reliability is not the main concern as the gate oxide thickness is further decreased. Moreover,
the relationship between ramped voltage stress (RVS) and constant voltage stress (CVS) results are established in this study.
Accurate conversion from ramped voltage stress (RVS) to constant voltage stress (CVS) can also be achieved, indicating that
the ramped voltage testing can be used to replace constant voltage tests, which is a fast and time-saving method.
Limitations/Future work:
The correlation between ramped voltage testing and constant voltage testing results was established using conductive
atomic force microscopy technology. However, the stress voltage was chose to control the breakdown time to be less than 500
seconds, in order to avoid thermal drift measurement errors. At a lower stress voltage, the power-law exponent n value is
needed to be verified and confirmed. Additionally, we need to extract the power-law exponent n value from constant voltage
testing in this study. In the future, we plan to use Poisson area to extract power-law exponent n value directly from the area
dependence of the ramped voltage testing.

Abstract- In this paper, we attempt to combine short length and
via number effects to study the impact on the electromigration
(EM) characteristics of dual damascene Cu lines. The results
revealed interesting differences in electromigration behaviours of
long and short length Cu lines. Increasing via number resulted in
a higher electromigration failure time, but is related to the line
length. For multiple-via structures with short Cu length,
electromigration lifetime was significantly enhanced due to
obvious back-stress effect and single failure mechanism of line
depletion. These observed effects are specific to Cu
dual-damascene structures and can have great technological
implications for electromigration assessment.
Keywords: electromigration, via, copper, reliability
I. INTRODUCTION
As the feature of integrated circuits (ICs) are scaled down to
submicron dimension, scaling devices or interconnects are
subjected to increasingly high current densities and high
electric field, leading to the reliability margin appear to be
shrinking. One of the most severe reliability concerns is
electromigration for integrated circuits interconnect [1,2]. In
addition to process improvement, the short length effect on the
electromigration lifetime is a valuable resource to increase
current limits in advanced circuits. This benefit is based on
back stress effect and this effect has become more evident for a
shorter lead [3].
The back stress effect is proportional to the critical current
density jc, which is the current density where electromigration
damage, either physical or electrical impact, is eliminated [4-6].
As a result, it is crucial for circuit reliability prediction to
characterize the critical current density jc of electromigration.
A number of investigations have been carried out to study
the effect of short length on electromigration in Cu damascene
interconnects. Blech length is observed in Cu damascene
structures as for Al interconnects. This effect may be
complicated in case of Cu interconnects than in Al
interconnects owing to the dual-damascene architecture [6-8].
But for most studies, short length electromigration study was
performed in Cu structures with only single via. The
complexity is due to the different failure mechanisms, voiding
occurring in the via- bottom and Cu/dielectric cap areas. It is
therefore important to investigate the effect of via number on
the short length structures in dual-damascene interconnects.
Moreover, in this study, the jc values of long and short metal
lines with single- and multiple-via structures were extracted
also.
II. EXPERIMENTAL
The electromigration test structures with metal length of 10
and 250 m from 40 nm technology were evaluated in this
study. The stressing electron is flowing from lower metal line
to higher metal line through the via as shown in Fig. 1. The via
number is varied from single via to 4 vias. The Cu
interconnects were embedded in low-k (k=2.5) material and
processed with a SiCN capping layer. The metal width and via
dimension are the same, i.e., 0.063 m. The stress current
density varied from 3 MA/cm2 to 15 MA/cm2 based on Cu line
cross-section area at a fixed temperature of 350oC. A sample
size of 20-30 was used for each experiment. Resistance
increase with time was monitored until failure. Failure criterion
of 10 % resistance increase was employed. The current supply
was stopped at 30% increase in order to minimize the
electromigration damage to the Cu interconnects for physical
failure analysis.

Fig. 3 Failure time distribution for 250 m-length Cu lines with dual-via
structure at different stress current densities.
This phenomena can be explained that the added via can help
to sustain the stress current, leading to the reduced stress
current density in each via. Thus, the maximum subjected
current of each via is still less than the via electromigration
capability. Therefore, the failure mechanism was emerged to
Cu/dielectrics interface at a higher stress current density (>10
MA/cm2).
Furthermore, via number effect on electromigration failure
time was compared shown in Fig. 4, median-time-to-failures
(t50) are slightly increased and saturated as the via number is
increase to larger than 3. Based on failure analysis, the major
failure mode is Cu line depletion through dominant
Cu/dielectrics interface diffusion. Furthermore, two failure
modes with different void locations were observed, one is void
formation from the first via and extend to the last via, the other
is from the last via along the current direction as shown in Fig.
5. For the former failure mode, other unfailed vias can share the
current, leading to failure time increase. However, for the latter
failure mode, the failure time is similar, independence of via
number since the same depletion volume of Cu-line void
causing 10% resistance increase. Moreover, for multiple-via
structure, the lifetime improvement is more obvious for the
lower stress density conditions.
Fig. 4 Failure time distribution for 250 m-length Cu lines at various via
structures, stressing on 5 MA/cm2.
Fig. 5 Failure modes for 250m-length Cu lines for multiple-via structures.
According to EM results with varying stress densities, we
can calculate jc according to Eq. (6) for multiple-via structure
exhibited in Fig. 6, jc is increased for the multiple-via structures.
Moreover, we can see that both the electromigration failure
time distribution and jc are slightly tight for dual-via structure
since the other failure mode (via-depletion mode) was
completely eliminated.
Fig. 6. Calculated jc distribution for 250 m-length Cu lines at various via
structures.
Completely different EM behaviour was observed for 10m
length Cu line as compared in Table 1. In short length Cu line
cases, longer failure times were observed due to strong
back-stress effect. However, this effect is becoming significant
at a lower stress current density (> 5 MA/cm2), especially for
multiple-via structures. As the stress current density is
increased (> 8 MA/cm2), this improvement tends to be minor.
In addition, in a single-via structure with the current density of
15 MA/cm2, electromigration behaviour is the same as that of
250 m length Cu line; most stressed samples failed at the
same time and less than 1 hr and the MTFs are almost
comparable. This result is consistent with the proposed
mechanism of via-voiding failure mode for 250m length Cu
line and also points out that there is no back-stress effect for the
via-voiding failure mechanism. Furthermore, the failure time
distribution becomes boarder as the stress current is reduced to
< 5 MA/cm2 for single-via structures with the length of 10m.
This large lifetime distribution can be improved by

For smaller Cu line width (0.1m), the median failure time is
also decreasing with the reduction of line thickness as shown in
Fig. 4. This is because the Cu effective drift velocity is inversely
proportional to the metal line thickness as the fast-diffusion path
is along the Cu interface [4]. For thickness above 0.2 m, the
lifetime is slightly reduced with decreasing metal thickness.
However, as the metal thickness is further decreased to below
0.18 m, there is a big reduction in electromigration median
failure time.

II. Lifetime dependence on Cu line width
Fig. 5 shows a plot of median lifetime (t50) as a function of
metal line widths. Similar to the line thickness effect on
electomigration, the median lifetime is clearly decreased with
decreasing line width. Moreover, for line width >0.1m line
width, the median lifetime (t50) is linearly inversely proportional
to the line width. However, as the line width is further deceased
to nanometer (or migrates to below 45 nm technology), the
electromigration lifetime is significantly decreased, largely
diverging from the linear trend. This implies that as the line
width is shrunk to below 0.07 m, electromigration
performance will be further deteriorating and will be a potential
issue.
