3found that, the charge density on the membrane of a human erythrocyte cell is of the order of 10-2 C/m2, and
which is mainly attributed to sialic acid (pKa = 2.6) and some undetermined, bound carboxylic acid (pKa =
3.35). In addition to both surface morphology and surface charged condition for cell membrane, the contact
angle between the membrane protein and the lipid bilayer also increases the complexity in mathematical
modeling [11]. Hence, in view of these, in the capillary electrophoresis, frequently used in the analysis of cell
membrane, understanding both the surface morphology and the charged condition on membrane via solving
EDL configuration seems also to be requisite.
Usually for mathematical modeling, the associated (loaded) polymer chains on a colloidal particle are
considered as an soft layer [12,13], wherein, the polymer chains are taken as a homogeneous charged layer.
For mathematical calculation, this may be fruitful, however more or less, some realistic conditions may become
ambiguous, depending on the distribution of loaded polymer chains on the surface of particle. Limited works
in the literature discuss the arbitrary surface morphology on the colloidal particle, not to mention the
heterogeneous distribution of surface charges. Little works analyze the effect of irregular surface morphology
on the colloidal particle based on Deryaguin approximation [14] or Fourier series [15-18], and the analyses
reveal that little surface roughness or undulation may lead to significant variation in EDL configuration. The
numerical result from a previous work [19] also shows that, slight undulation of a charged surface may result in
a significant variation of fluid velocity near the surface. Therefore, to deal with both the complexity of surface
morphology and charged condition, an attempt is made in this work to solve EDL configuration near a charged
surface system possessing simultaneously the arbitrary geography and the arbitrary charge distribution. And
for this, a dissimilarly charged protrusions (DCP) surface model in an electrolyte solution, which gives
consideration to complexity of these two in mathematical modeling, is suggested. The solution for this
elementary, novel model based on Fourier series is introduced, and the discussion is confined to the condition
of little surface roughness or protrusion, wherein the perturbation technique is applied.
2. Mathematical modeling
The dissimilarly charged protrusions surface model under consideration, which is immersed in an
electrolyte solution, is illustrated in Fig. 1 (a). This charged surface model is an one-dimensional, infinite,
periodic, charged surface, wherein within each period of charged surface system, there are two distinct regions,
including the dissimilarly charged protrusion, of which the surface charge density is p , and the flat surface, of
which the surface charge density is f . Assuming that the height of charged surface system varies
periodically along the abscissa, it can be described within a period by a piecewise-defined function as

In these boundary conditions, i.e. equations (5) to (7), equation (5) describes the symmetry of charged surface
system at both 0X and 2/LX x , equation (6) implies the continuity of the normal component of
displacement field cross the charged surface, where we have assumed that there is no electrical field in the
region under the charged surface for mathematical simplicity, and equation (7) implies the vanishment of
electrical potential field at infinity.

This polynomial shape function has its values equal to 1 and 0 at 0X and 2/XX p , respectively, and
also has its derivative equal to zero at these points. In addition, it is symmetric about the Z axis. Moreover,
1Xp  , and 5.0f  . The dimensionless form of surface charge density )X(s (or p and f ) has its
physical meaning. When a flat, uniformly charged surface is under consideration, it is equal to the value of
 on surface. Therefore, for applicability of Debye-Huckel approximation, its value is confined to 1 at the
utmost in our analysis. Fig. 2 demonstrates the numerical result of electrical potential field for our charged
surface system when 2Lx  , 1.0 , and 1p  . In this figure, to display the surface electrical potential
on protrusion, we have made the grids of X axis (meridians) equally spaced, and the grids of Z axis
(parallels) spaced according to the intersections between the grids of X and the surface of protrusion in the
region lower than the vertex of protrusion. The electrical potential field of our charged surface system is
symmetric about three planes, including 0X , and 2/LX x . From the solution surface of )Z,X(
shown in Fig. 2 (a), the electrical potential field appears mainly a strong function of X in both the regions
above and below the vertex of protrusion, and in the meanwhile, it shows a depression near the protrusion,
wherein the lowest of depression seems to be near the interface between the protrusion and the flat surface
( 2/XX p ). To understand the distribution of electrical potential field in a more detailed manner, we depict
the lateral view of )Z,X( along the direction parallel to Z axis, together with the surface electrical
potential )X(s of charged surface system (a function of X ), as is illustrated in Fig. 2 (b). Along each
meridian from the charged surface (going deeper into the electrolyte solution), the magnitude of  decreases;
along each parallel from 2/LX x , the magnitude of  increases, and it reaches to a maximum on the
surface of protrusion (or at 0X ). The latter reveals the fact that the surface charge density on protrusion
surface is greater than that of on flat surface in magnitude, i.e. pf  . The surface electrical potential s
shows a more interesting distribution. The magnitude of s increases for a start from 2/LX x , reaches
to a maximum near 2/XX p , and decreases gradually to a minimum at the vertex of protrusion, wherein
the minimum is far higher than its magnitude at 2/LX x . There are two effects in the main which are
responsible for this. One is the strength of charges on charged surface system, and the other is the concavity
of surface, wherein the latter has been discussed in a previous work [18], and the analysis from this work shows
that the concave inward/outward on a charged surface will strengthen/weaken the magnitude of electrical
potential field. Basically, the magnitude of s on protrusion surface is presumably greater than that on flat
surface, since pf  . However, these two concavities near the vertex of protrusion ( 0X ) and near the
interface between the protrusion and the flat surface ( 2/XX p ), where they are respectively concave
outward and inward (referring to Fig. 1 (b)), would weaken and strengthen the magnitude of s respectively.
As a consequence, considering both of these two effects, i.e. the strength of charges on charged surface system
13
since the dissimilarly charged surfaces do not protrude into the electrolyte solution, from 2/LX x , the
magnitude of s increases gradually, and reaches to a maximum at 0X , as is shown in Fig. 5 (b). The
last subject discusses the effect of dissimilarly charged condition on protrusions (referring to Fig. 3 (c)). To
understand this effect, we set the surface charge density on protrusions being the same with that on flat surface
(similarly charged protrusions), i.e. fp  , and the solution surface and the lateral view of )Z,X( along
the direction parallel to Z axis are depicted in Fig. 6 (a) and (b) respectively, where in these two figures,
2Lx  , 1.0 , and 5.0fp  . Compared with Fig. 2, we find that, dissimilarly charged condition
could lead to large change of electrical potential field, in both its magnitude and its distribution. For condition
of similarly charged protrusions, for the same reason mentioned above that, two effects, including the depth into
the electrolyte solution for the protrusion, and the concave outward of protrusion, offset each other, the
distribution of )Z,X( is quite similar to that for the condition of completely flat surface carrying uniform
charges with its surface charge density f . Consequently, if we consider the discussion in the second subject,
it can be concluded that, the effect of dissimilarly charged condition on EDL configuration is nearly
independent of the geography of charged surface system.
In present work, for illustration, we designate the shape function of protrusion as a polynomial form, and
the surface charge density of both protrusion and flat surface as a constant. However, this condition is just a
special one that the methodology suggested here could deal with. According to equations (19) to (24),
derivation of coefficients j,ic needs only the knowledge of both the shape function of protrusion and the form
of surface charge density on our charged surface system. Therefore, this suggested model can be applied on
any form of shape function of protrusion (even the shape function has jumps), for example, the rectangular, the
indentation (protrusion downward), the triangular, the circular (referring to Fig. 7), and so forth. In the
meanwhile, it is also applicable for any form of charged condition on charged surface system, not confined to
the condition of step form in our illustration, as is shown in Fig. 1 (c). In addition to these above, the
applicability of present charged surface model is not confined to the condition of symmetry geometry. In the
demonstration in present work, the symmetry geometry is introduced for solely mathematical simplicity, and
based on such an assumption, only the cosine-form eigenfunctions in equation (11) need to be considered.
When a condition of asymmetric geometry is under consideration, the sine-form eigenfunctions should be also
taken into account in equation (11). Nevertheless, this solely raises the calculation work, and does not raise
the complexity of computing algorithm used. For conceptual presentation, the suggested methodology is here
illustrated on an one-dimensional charged surface, however, it can be extended directly to a more general, more
realistic, two-dimensional charged surface, and this will be a focal point in our oncoming work.
5. Conclusions
In this work, combining both the conditions of dissimilarly charged flat surfaces and similarly charged
protrusions, we successfully derive the semi-analytical solution for EDL configuration near a dissimilarly

1. Introduction
Dissimilarly charged entities attached to (or embedded into) a charged surface are frequently encountered
in nature or in advanced technologies, like the biological cell membrane and the micro- or nano-scale fabricated,
modified particles. For the latter, numerous works could be found in literature, for example, DNA-loaded
cationic lipid particles for gene delivery in cancer curing [1], the heparin-loaded cationic lipid particles for the
differentiation of stem cells [2], the poly(acrylic acid)-grafted silica particle as an selective-filter functionalized
drug delivery device [3], -MPS modified silica particle for the fabrication of dental nanocomposite [4], the
polymer-encapsulated silica particle, SG-PS-azo-IM particle, for the adsorption of transition metal ions from
the treated water [5], and so on. Based on the fluid-mosaic model [6], the biological cell membrane is mainly
composed of lipid bilayer and membrane proteins, wherein the globular, granular membrane proteins are
associated with the lipid bilayer through the noncovalent interactions (both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic
forces). Typically, the thickness of lipid bilayer is about 50 Angstroms (5 nm), and the entire width of
lipid-protein bilayer matrix is about 80 Angstroms (8 nm) in geometry. Both of lipid bilayer (including four
kinds of lipids, i.e. phosphoacylglycerol, sphingomyelin, cerebroside, and ganglioside) and membrane proteins
(over ten kinds) are likely to contribute charges on membrane due to the dissociation of functional groups on
them. The electron microscopic image of a fracture of the freeze-etching human erythrocyte membrane shows
that, there are about 5102.6  particles of 8.5 nm in diameter distributed randomly on its surface. These
particles are presumed the sialoglycoprotein, and some undetermined glycoprotein of 100000 daltons, and they
are responsible for about 20% of the surface area of erythrocyte membrane [7]. Through microelectrophoresis
in a chamber of millimeter-scale diameter, Seaman and his coworkers [8-10] found that, the charge density on
the membrane of a human erythrocyte cell is of the order of 10-2 C/m2, attributed to sialic acid (pKa = 2.6) and
some undetermined, bound carboxylic acid (pKa = 3.35). In view of the delicate architecture on cell
membrane, the simulation for the configuration of electrical double layer (EDL) on its surface could be quite
complicated, if both its morphology and its charged condition are considered simultaneously. This is also true
for the simulation of EDL configuration on the surface of a micro- or nano-scale, functionalized colloidal
particles. In the literature, the relevant works are quite limited.
In this work, for simulation of randomly distributed, dissimilarly charged small particles on a charged
surface, like the membrane proteins on a biological cell membrane, or the small polymeric granules on a
modified, micro-scale functionalized particle, we proposed a dissimilarly charged protrusion array (DCPA)
surface model, which could take simultaneously both the surface morphology and the surface charged condition
into account in mathematical modeling. EDL configuration on this model will be solved based on double
Fourier series and perturbation technique. In mathematical formulation, this work is a two-dimensional
extended study for our pervious work [11], wherein we dealt with an one-dimensional, dissimilarly charged
protrusions surface model.

Finally, substituting equations (25) and (29) into equations (22) and (23), and using the Newton’s central
difference method, together with the expressions of )Y,X(fp , X/)Y,X(fp  , and Y/)Y,X(fp  , we thus
obtain the undetermined coefficients jk,ic through the numerical integration of equations (21) to (23). In
numerical calculation, for the eigenfunction expansion series of each order term )Z,Y,X(i , expressed in
equation (12), the first 20 terms in each summation is taken initially, then doubled in the succeeding iteration.
The iteration continues, till the sum of jk,ic for each order term )Z,Y,X(i , which is the maximum of
magnitude of )Z,Y,X(i , in two successive iterations are different from each other by an appropriate

the protrusion and the flat surface (referring to the curve of 0 in Fig. 5 (b)). The tendency of s here is
quite different from that in condition of one-dimensional, dissimilarly charged protrusions surface model
discussed in our previous work [11], wherein in the latter, a maximum of its magnitude exists near the interface
between the protrusion and the flat surface due to mainly the effect of inward concavity of charged surface
nearby. In present study, the surface of demonstrative protrusion, expressed by equation (3), is thoroughly
concave outward, and therefore, the maximum of its magnitude appears at the vertex of protrusion, wherein the
strength of charges from the charged surface is the greatest. In general in modeling a charged surface, we may
ignore the complexity in both its surface morphology and its surface charged condition for mathematical
simplicity, and consider the charged surface as a flat charged surface, with its surface charge density equal to a
lumped, mean value, m . To evaluate the inaccuracy from this ignorance, we measure the lumped, mean
surface charge density on this“idealized”flat charged surface for our DCPA surface as

equivalent to the scaled surface electrical potential on this“idealized”flat charge surface, is designated on Fig.
5 (b), as the dash line in this figure shows. Comparing the distribution of s on our DCPA surface with the
level of m , it is apparently found that, it would be quite inadequate to simplify (“idealize”) our DCPA surface
using an“idealized”flat charged surface. As can be seen from this figure for the present study, the magnitude
of s is greater/smaller than m when the radial coordinate is smaller/larger than about 1.2 times the value
of pR , wherein the difference between these two could be as large as about 30% of m .
As has been mentioned in the previous work [11], for each kind of DCPA, the coefficients jk,ic , expressed
by equations (21) through (23), depend only on both the shape function of protrusion, )Y,X(fp , and the
distribution of surface charge density on DCPA, )Y,X(s , and therefore, the methodology introduced here is
applicable for DCPA of arbitrary surface morphology and arbitrary charged condition. For example, the
non-uniformly-charged cone-like, or globular membrane proteins on cell membrane are imitable by the present
model, even when the contact angle between the membrane proteins and the lipid bilayer needs to be taken into
account. In addition, if an asymmetric protrusion is concerned in DCPA, the eigenfunctions of sine type
should be taken into account in equation (12).

41. Introduction
The charged conditions of nano- and micro-sized particles are often characterized by
electrophoresis, the translation of charged entities driven by an applied electric field. This
technique is also widely adopted as a separation and/or processing tool. The former is common in
biological and biomedical fields where entities of similar charged conditions are
separated/differentiated from those having different charged conditions.1,2 Typical example for
the latter is electrodeposition3-5 where uniform thin layers can be prepared by appropriately
designed operations.
Since the pioneer theoretical works of Helmholtz6 and Smoluchowski,7 electrophoresis has
been studied extensively both analytically and experimentally. Theoretically, because the
governing equations are coupled and highly nonlinear, obtaining exact analytical solution under
general conditions is almost impossible. Reported results are either approximate analytical
expressions based on idealized/simplified conditions8-10 or purely numerical results.11,12 In
practice, two effects can play a role in electrophoresis operation, namely, the presence of a
boundary and the influence of nearby particles. The former can be significant if the space where
electrophoresis is conducted is relatively narrow such as in capillary electrophoresis, and the latter
is important if the concentration of particles is appreciable. These effects have been discussed by
many investigators recently.13-15
Classic analysis on electrophoresis was based on rigid particles. Although this type of
particles is common to inorganic entities, it becomes unrealistic for the description of many organic
and biological entities such as polyelectrolytes.16-19 Soft or fuzzy particles,20-26 which comprise a
rigid core and a membrane layer, are another example where assuming rigid entity is inappropriate.
Biological cells such as human erythrocyte, the peripheral zone of which contains a glycoprotein
layer,27 can be simulated by soft particles, and therefore, is not suitable to be treated as rigid
particles. The electrophoresis of soft particles is usually more complicated than that of the
corresponding rigid particles because the membrane layer of the former will influence appreciably
on both its electric and hydrodynamic nature. Several theoretical attempts have been made to
simulate the electrophoretic behavior of a soft particle. For instance, Ohshima28-30 derived an
analytical expression for the electrophoretic mobility of an ion-penetrable sphere. Saville,31 Hill
et al.32 and López-García et al.33,34 investigated the electrophoresis of a spherical soft particle in
an infinite medium taking the effect of double layer relaxation and polarization into account. The
electrophoresis of a spherical dispersion of soft particles was modeled by several investigators.35-37
Lee et al.38 studied the electrophoresis of a soft particle in an uncharged spherical cavity.
The influence of boundary on the electrophoretic behavior of a particle has been studied by
many investigators through considering various types of geometry.39-45 Available results for soft
particles, however, are still very limited, especially those take the charge-regulated nature of the
membrane layer of a particle into account. In this case, the distribution of the fixed charge in the
membrane layer of a particle depends upon the degree of dissociation/association of the ionizable
functional groups.46-49 Mathematically, this leads to a mixed type of boundary condition for the
electric field on the particle surface, making the solution procedure more complicated compared
with that for the case where a constant potential or constant charge density is assumed.
6that is, on the order of ca. 25 mV. In addition, the applied electric field is weak compared with
that established by the particle and the pore, that is, weaker than ca. 25 kV/m. Under these
conditions, the electric potential of the system under consideration, , can be expressed, for a
simpler mathematical treatment, as 21   .12 1 and 2 are the equilibrium potential, that
is, the electrical potential in the absence of E, and a perturbed potential outside the particle arising
from E, respectively. In scaled forms, these potentials can be expressed as29

Suppose that the fixed charge in the membrane layer of a particle arises from the dissociation of
the ionizable functional groups. For illustration, we assume that the membrane layer contains
monoprotic acidic functional groups AH only, the dissociation of which can be expressed by
 HAAH . (3)
The dissociation constant of this reaction, Ka, is
[AH]
]][H[A aK . (4)
where a symbol with square bracket denotes number concentration. If the spatial variation of H+
follows Boltzmann distribution, then because the surface potential is low, it can be shown that51

The present problem is solved by the method proposed by O’Brien and White.12 Based on a
balance of the forces acting on the particle in the z-direction, it can be shown that the scaled

because a is fixed, varying the value of a implies that the concentration of electrolytes varies.
Here, U increases monotonically with the increasing A because the larger the A the higher the
concentration of the acidic functional groups in the membrane layer of the particle. This leads to
a higher fixed charge density, and therefore, a greater electric driving force, as seen in Figure 3b.
Figure 3a reveals that U may have a local maximum as a varies. This arises from the
competition between *EF and
*
2,DF . As seen in Figure 4b,
*
EF increases and
*
2,DF decreases
monotonically with decreasing a . Note that if a is small, *EF dominates, and if a is
large, * 2,DF dominates.

 (or pH) on the behavior of the scaled electrophoretic

2,DF are presented in Figure 4. As
seen, U increases with decreasing B because if Ka is fixed, a smaller B implies a lower bulk
concentration of H+, which is advantageous to the dissociation of AH. It is interesting to note that
if B is either very small or very large, U decreases monotonically with increasing a , but if B
takes a medium large value, U has a local maximum as a varies. These results can be
explained by the variations of the scaled forces *EF and
*
2,DF shown in Figure 4b.

The influences of the friction coefficient of the membrane layer of a particle, measured by a ,
on its scaled electrophoretic mobility U and the associated scaled forces, *EF ,
*
2,DF , and
*D ,
are illustrated Figure 6. U is seen to decrease with increasing a , which is expected because
the larger the a the greater the friction arising from the presence of the membrane layer of the
particle, as can also be justified by the variation of the scaled drag coefficient *D shown in Figure
6c. Figure 6a indicates that if a is large, U decreases with increasing a . However, if
a is small, U increases with increasing a . These behaviors can be explained by the
variations of *EF and
*
2,DF presented in Figure 6b. If a is not large, *EF decreases with
increasing a , but *DF 2, increases at the same time. If a is large, *EF dominates, but
*
2,DF dominates if a is small. As seen in Figure 6b, if a is sufficiently large, * 2,DF has a
local maximum as a varies. Note that if a takes a medium large value, U has a local
maximum as a varies.

The influence of the boundary effect, measured by the relative size of the pore, (c/a), on the
electrophoretic behavior of the particle is illustrated in Figure 7. Here, because a is fixed, the
smaller the (c/a) the more significant the boundary effect is. In general, the more significant the
boundary effect, the smaller the U , as expected. It is interesting to see that if (c/a) sufficiently
small, U has a local maximum as a varies. This arises from the competition between *EF

dominates if a is sufficiently large, as shown in Figure 9b. Note that as a increases, U
may change its sign from negative to positive. In addition, U has a positive local maximum as

various values of a for the case of a negatively charged pore at A=5, B=1, c/a=2, and d/a=0.5.

Figure 12 illustrates the boundary effect, measured by the ratio (c/a) on the scaled
electrophoretic mobility of a particle, U , and the scaled forces, *EF ,
*
2,DF , and
*D . This
figure reveals that if a is small (thick double layer), U is negative and U increases with
increasing (c/a). As seen in Figures 12b and 12c, this is because the driving force is dominated
by *EF and it increases with the increasing (c/a),
*D declines with increasing (c/a). If a
takes a medium large value, no general trend is observed for U as (c/a) increases. If a is
sufficiently large, U becomes positive, and U increases with increasing (c/a). As seen in
Figures 12b and 12c, this is because although *2,DF , which is the dominating driving forces,
decreases with increasing (c/a), *D decreases at the same time, and the rate of decrease in *D as
(c/a) increases is faster than that in *2,DF .

has a local maximum as a varies.
For the case where the pore is negatively charged, we conclude the following. (a) If a is
small (thick double layer), U* is negative, and becomes positive if a is sufficiently large. U*
has a positive local maximum as a varies. If U* is negative, U increases with increasing
concentration of the acidic functional groups in the membrane layer of the particle, but the reverse
trend is observed for positive U*. (b) If a is small, U increases with decreasing bulk
concentration of H+, but the reverse trend is observed if a is sufficiently large. (c) If a is
small, U* is negative and U increases with increasing thickness of membrane layer; if a is
sufficiently large, U* is positive and declines with increasing thickness of membrane layer. (d) If
a is small, U* is negative and declines monotonically with increasing friction coefficient of the
membrane layer; if a is sufficiently large, U* becomes positive, and increases with increasing
friction coefficient of the membrane layer. (e) If a is small, U* is negative and U increases
with decreasing boundary effect; for a medium thin double layer, no general trend is observed for
U* as the boundary effect declines, if a is sufficiently large, U* becomes positive, and increases
with decreasing boundary effect.
