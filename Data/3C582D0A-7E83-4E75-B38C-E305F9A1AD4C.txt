Abstract 
 
There are basically two methods for state 
estimator design for systems with unknown 
inputs. The first is to produce unknown-input 
decoupled state estimation, in which the 
obtained exact unknown-input decoupled filter 
is not affected by the values of the unknown 
inputs. And, the other is to estimate the state 
with unknown-input/bias estimation, in which 
the optimal state estimates are obtained from 
the well-known Kalman filter. In general, there 
is no single filter which can perform the best 
filtering performance in all applications. 
In this project, the unbiased minimum- 
variance filtering for systems with unknown 
inputs which affect both the system model and 
the measurements is addressed. Exact, partial, 
and optimal filtering problems are formulated 
and studied. All these problems are 
intrinsically interconnected, and a 
parametrized filter structure serving as a 
unified solution to all the addressed problems 
is presented. Specifically, we show in this 
report that the proposed unified filter structure 
incorporates two literature results: the optimal 
estimator filter and the Kalman filter as special 
cases.

unknown inputs. Other than Kalman ﬁltering al-
gorithm, an optimal FIR ﬁltering algorithm [11]
had also been proposed to solve the aforemen-
tioned general unknown inputs ﬁltering prob-
lem. In this approach the unknown inputs are
modeled as random-walk processes similar to
Kalman ﬁltering approaches. They are treated as
auxiliary states to develop an augmented system.
Then, the optimal FIR ﬁltering algorithm for this
augmented system is derived to obtain estimates
of the unknown inputs utilizing measurements
in the current window. It was stated in [11] that
this optimal FIR ﬁlter is known to be robust to
temporary modeling uncertainties in most cases.
Unfortunately, this result only applies to time-
invariant systems.
In general, there may not be any knowledge
concerning the model of the unknown inputs.
Thus, there is no single ﬁlter which can perform
the best ﬁltering performance in all applications:
the EUIDF may not be globally optimum in the
mean square error sense [1] and it is known
that the optimality of the KF is guaranteed
only when the model is exactly valid. This has
motivated this research in developing a uniﬁed
ﬁlter structure which may achieve the optimal
ﬁltering performance in general unknown-input
ﬁltering problems. In an early attempt [1], we
proposed an optimal minimum-variance ﬁlter,
which combines an EUIDF and some unknown-
input ﬁlters, to give a potential reﬁnement to
remedy the performance degradation problem of
the EUIDF. In a recent paper [2], a new param-
eterizing technique for the derivation of unbi-
ased minimum-variance ﬁlters was presented to
generalize the result given in [1]. Speciﬁcally,
the connection between the OEF and the KF
is established through this new parameterizing
technique. It should be noted that the optimiza-
tion method used in [2] is the parameteriz-
ing technique given in [6]. In [3], an optimal
parametrized minimum-variance ﬁlter (OPMVF)
was proposed to achieve an optimal compromise
between the EUIDF and the KF by making
use of the parametrized ﬁlter structure [2], the
constrained optimization method, and an optimal
switching rule. Most recently, we have also pro-
posed an optimal unbiased minimum-variance
ﬁlter, which appears to have the most general
form [4].
In this research, we adopt the similar ap-
proach given in [12] to formulate the addressed
problem as the following different categories of
problems: exact, partial, and optimal ﬁltering
problems. All these problems are intrinsically in-
terconnected, and the optimal solutions to these
problems are presented. A uniﬁed (parametrized)
ﬁlter structure is then presented to integrate all
the obtained solutions. Speciﬁcally, we show
that the proposed uniﬁed ﬁlter structure incor-
porates the OEF and the KF as special cases.
This report is organized as follows. Section II
states the problem of interest. It is followed
by a derivation of the optimal unknown-input
ﬁlter in Section III. In Section IV, speciﬁc un-
biased minimum-variance ﬁlter designs for the
addressed three categories of problems are pre-
sented. The relationships between these results
with the OEF and the KF are given. In Section V,
a parametrized minimum-variance ﬁlter (PMVF)
is proposed as a uniﬁed ﬁlter structure for sys-
tems with unknown inputs. In Section VI, An
application of the PMVF to derive an optimal
ﬁltering algorithm for systems with unknown
inputs is proposed. An illustrative example is
given in Section VII to demonstrate the proposed
results. Section VIII gives the conclusions.
II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
Consider the linear discrete-time stochastic
time-varying system with unknown inputs in the
form
xk+1 = Φkxk + Fkdk + wk (2)
yk = Hkxk + Gkdk + vk (3)
where xk ∈ Rn is the system state, dk ∈ Rq
is the unknown input, and yk ∈ Rp is the
output. wk and vk are uncorrelated white noises
sequences of zero-mean and covariance matrices
Qk ≥ 0 and Rk ≥ 0, respectively. The initial
state x0 is of mean x¯0 and covariance P0 and
is independent of wk and vk. We assume that
p ≥ q and, without loss of generality, that
rank
[
Hk Gk
]
= p.
The problem of interest in this paper is to
design an unbiased minimum-variance linear es-
timator of xk, denoted as xˆk, given measure-
ments up to time instant k. Let ek = xk − xˆk
be the estimation error and Pk = E{eke′k}
the estimation error covariance, where ′ denotes
3
IV. UNBIASED MINIMUM-VARIANCE
FILTER DESIGNS
From (2), (3), and (4), the dynamics of ek is
given by
ek = Nkek−1 + Ψkwk−1 − Lkvk + e˜k (15)
where
e˜k = ΨkFk−1dk−1 − V 1k dˆk−1 − LkGkdk
−V 2k dˆk (16)
Nk = ΨkΦk−1 (17)
Ψk = I − LkHk. (18)
Note that in order to obtain an unbiased estima-
tion, one has E[e˜k] = 0. Then, the propagation
of the error covariance corresponding to (15) is
given by
Pk = ΨkP¯k−1Ψ′k + LkRkL

+NkE[ek−1e˜′k] + E[e˜ke

where
P¯k = ΦkPkΦ

k + Qk. (20)
A. Exact Unknown-Input Decoupled Filter De-
sign
To solve the exact unknown-input decoupled
ﬁlter design problem, i.e., to obtain a ﬁlter which
is free of the unknown input, we obtain e˜k = 0,
which is satisﬁed if one chooses
V 1k = ΨkFk−1 = 0 (21)
V 2k = LkGk = 0. (22)
Using (21) and (22), which are known as the
conventional unbiasedness constraints, Lk is de-
termined by satisfying the following constraint:
LkΣk =
[
Fk−1 0
]
,
Σk =
[
HkFk−1 Gk
]
. (23)
Under the following sufﬁcient condition (for the
proof, see Lemma 2 of [6]):
rank[Σk] = rank[Fk−1] + rank[Gk] (24)
the solution of (23) is given by
Lk = Fˆk + ZkGˆk (25)
where Zk is an arbitrary matrix,
Fˆk =
[
Fk−1 0
]
Σ+k (26)
Gˆk = αk(I − ΣkΣ+k ) (27)
in which A+ denotes any generalized inverse of
matrix A and αk is chosen to assure that Gˆk is
of full row rank.
Next, we consider the minimum-variance es-
timation problem. Using e˜k = 0 and (18) in (19)
yields
Pk = LkCkL
′
k − P¯k−1H ′kL′k − LkHkP¯k−1
+P¯k−1 (28)
where
Ck = HkP¯k−1H ′k + Rk. (29)
Now, the problem remains to ﬁnd the matrix Zk
such that the trace of Pk in (28) is minimized.
The result is given as follows:
Zk = (P¯k−1H ′k − FˆkCk)Gˆ′k{GˆkCkGˆ′k}−1. (30)
Note that the above obtained exact unknown-
input decoupled ﬁlter is equivalent to the OEF.
Although the exact unknown-input decoupled
ﬁlter is a certain kind of optimal estimator
under the assumption that there is absolutely no
information about the unknown inputs, unfortu-
nately it may have a performance degradation
problem. The reason lies in the fact that the
sufﬁcient condition (24) which guarantees the
unbiasedness constraints, i.e., (21) and (22), may
exhibit restricted applications. More speciﬁcally,
the performance degradation problem will occur
if the following implication holds:
rank[Σk] = rank[Fk−1] + rank[Gk]
⇒ I − ΣkΣ+k = 0 (31)
where I−AA+ = 0 implies that the matrix A is
of full row rank. If this is the case, the matrix Σk
in (23) will be of full row rank. Thus, one has
Gˆk = 0 and the proposed unbiased minimum-
variance ﬁlter (4) will become to the following
degenerated ﬁlter:
xˆk = Φk−1xˆk−1 + Fˆk(yk −HkΦk−1xˆk−1) (32)
which has the following error covariance:
Pk = Ak−1P¯k−1A′k−1 + FˆkRkFˆ
′
k (33)
where Ak = I − FˆkHk. The minimum error
covariance in (28) can be rewritten as follows:
Pk = Ak−1P¯k−1A′k−1 + FˆkRkFˆ
′
k
−ZkGˆkCkGˆ′kZ ′k. (34)

the solution of (52) is given by
Lk = Fˆ

Fˆ 2k =

(Σ2k)
+ (56)
Gˆ2k = α
2
k(I − Σ2k(Σ2k)+). (57)
Using (51)-(53) in (16) yields
e˜k = ΨkΔFk−1dk−1 − V 1k dˆk−1 (58)
where the identity ΨkF˜k−1 = 0 is used. Choos-
ing
V 1k = ΨkΔFk−1 (59)
and assuming that the estimation error edk is
unbiased, i.e., E[edk] = 0, then we obtain that
the proposed ﬁlter (4) is an unbiased one.
Using (15), (17), (18), (9), (58), and (59), the
covariance P˜k is propagated as follows:
P˜k = Ψk{}1k −Ψk({}1kS ′k + {}2kH ′k)(Kdk)′
+LkRk(K

′ (60)
where
{}1k = Φk−1P˜k−1 + ΔFk−1P dk−1 (61)
{}2k = P¯k−1 + ΔFk−1P˜ ′k−1Φ′k−1. (62)
Finally, the problem remains to determine Z2k .
Using (17), (58), and (59) in (19) yields the
following error covariance Pk:
Pk = LkC¯

Solving Z2k for the minimization of the trace of
Pk in (63), one obtains
Z2k = ((P¯k−1 + Ξ¯k−1)H

k − Fˆ 2k C¯2k)(Gˆ2k)′
×{Gˆ2kC¯2k(Gˆ2k)′}−1. (66)
C. Optimal Unknown-Input Filtering Design
It is clear that in the exact/partial unknown-
input decoupled ﬁlter design problem, the gain
matrix Lk must satisﬁes some constraints, e.g.,
(21)-(22), (35), and (51). However, if this is not
possible then we intend to solve the optimal
unknown-input ﬁltering problem, which is also
known as the Kalman ﬁltering problem. In this
subsection, we show how to derive the conven-
tional Kalman ﬁlter via the proposed unbiased
minimum-variance ﬁlter. In this regard, we as-
sume that the unknown inputs can be exactly
modeled by random-walk processes as in (5).
Hence, the estimator dˆk, the gain matrix Kdk , and
the error covariance P dk are given by (6), (13),
and (14), respectively.
Choosing
V 1k = ΨkFk−1 (67)
V 2k = −LkGk (68)
and using (5) in (16) yield
e˜k = ΨkFk−1edk−1 − LkGkedk. (69)
Using (15), (17), (9), and (69), the covariance
P˜k is propagated as follows:
P˜k = Ψk{•}1k −Ψk({•}1kS ′k + {•}2kH ′k)(Kdk)′
+LkRk(K
d
k)
′ − LkGkP dk (70)
where
{•}1k = Φk−1P˜k−1 + Fk−1P dk−1 (71)
{•}2k = P¯k−1 + Fk−1P˜ ′k−1Φ′k−1. (72)
Using the following identity
Hk{•}1k + GkP dk
= [Hk({•}1kS ′k + {•}2kH ′k) + Rk](Kdk)′ (73)
which is veriﬁed by using (11)-(14), (70) can be
simpliﬁed as follows:
P˜k = {•}1k − ({•}1kS ′k + {•}2kH ′k)(Kdk)′. (74)
Finally, the considered problem remains to
determine Lk. Using (69) in (19) yields the
following error covariance Pk:
Pk = Lk{•}kL′k + P¯k−1 + Ξk−1
−
(
(P¯k−1 + Ξk−1)H ′k + ΩkG

VI. APPLICATION TO OPTIMAL FILTERING
FOR SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN INPUTS
The proposed PMVF given in the previous
section is characterized by two design param-
eters: F˜k−1 and G˜k, which can be constrained
as follows:
Lk
[
HkF˜k−1 G˜k
]
=
[
F˜k−1 0
]
. (95)
Two literature results have been derived using
the PMVF as shown in Section IV. In the ﬁrst
case, i.e., for the EUIDF(OEF), one chooses
F˜k−1 = Fk−1 and G˜k = Gk, which result in
e˜k = 0. This signiﬁes that the obtained ﬁlter is
completely free of the unknown inputs. Hence,
the relationship between the unknown inputs and
the estimation error is zero. This is the main
design discipline in the conventional exact input
decoupled ﬁlter design problem. On the other
hand, in the second case, i.e., for the KF, one
chooses F˜k−1 = 0 and G˜k = 0. Note that for
this special case, the constraints in (95) are null,
which signiﬁes that the obtained gain matrix Lk
will not be constrained to the form as given
in (85). And hence, the relationship between
the unknown inputs and the estimation error
will not be zero. Thus, the problem seeks to
minimize the inﬂuence of the unknown inputs on
the estimation error. This is the main design goal
in the well-known Kalman ﬁltering problem.
From the above discussions, it is clear that
any F˜k−1 and G˜k which satisfy (95) will lead to
one solution of all obtainable minimum-variance
ﬁlters and achieve a compromise between the
KF and the EUIDF. In general, the numbers of
those obtainable F˜k−1 and G˜k are inﬁnite. In
order to limit the numbers, one may focus on
the special forms of F˜k−1 and G˜k as follows:
F˜k−1 ⊆ Fk−1 and G˜k ⊆ Gk, where M ⊆
N means that the matrix M is obtained by
replacing some elements or no element of matrix
N with zero. Thus, an optimal PMVF (OPMVF)
can be obtained by searching for the best F˜k−1
and G˜k at each time instant with the following
optimization criteria:
min
F˜k−1,G˜k
(ζT1 P
−1
k ζ1 + ζ
T
2 R
−1
k ζ2)
where ζ1 = xˆk−Φk−1xˆk−1−Fk−1dˆk−1 and ζ2 =
yk −Hkxˆk −Gkdˆk.
VII. AN ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
To illustrate the proposed results, the ﬁltering
performances of the previously addressed ﬁlters
are considered by applying the numerical ex-
ample given by [6], where the parameters of
system (2)-(3) are given by Hk = I2, Rk =
diag(0.01, 0.16), and
Φk =
[
−0.0005 −0.0084
0.0517 0.8069
]
Fk =
[
0.0129 0
−1.2504 0
]
, Gk =
[
0 0
0 1
]
Qk =
[
0.0036 0.0342
0.0342 0.3249
]
.
The initial state and its estimate are both as-
sumed to be zero, and the initial covariance is
given by P0 = diag(10, 200). The unknown
inputs are given by
dk =
[
5us[k]− 5us[k − 20] + 5us[k − 70]
4us[k]− 4us[k − 30] + 4us[k − 65]
]
where us[k] is the unit-step function. In this
simulation example, we assume that Qdk =
diag{0.025, 0.016} and the simulation time is
100 time steps.
The simulation results in Table 2 show the
root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) in the state es-
timates of the considered ﬁlters. In implement-
ing the ﬁlters: PUIDF1 and PUIDF2, we have
used G˜k = 0 in the former and F˜k−1 = 0
in the latter. It can be seen from Table 2 that
the the PUIDF1, the PUIDF2, and the OUIF
all have better ﬁltering performances than that
of the EUIDF(OEF). It should be noted that in
this simulation example the matrix Σ¯k is of full
row rank, and hence one has I − Σ¯kΣ¯+k = 0.
Thus, the EUIDF(OEF) is implemented by the
degenerated ﬁlter (32). Also note that the new
derived PUIDF1 has the best ﬁltering perfor-
mance. Furthermore, we note that the OUIF has
slightly better performance than the KF. In Figs.
1 and 2, we have plotted the actual sub-states
x1k and x
2
k and their estimates of the EUIDF, the
PUIDF1, the PUIDF2, the OUIF, and the KF.
