temporal/spatial algebra system as efficient 
computation model to unify time-varying events and 
spatial-varying objects. Several computation 
algorithms and operation tables which include a set 
of complete temporal logics are proposed. The 
combined temporal/spatial data models are generalized 
by composing point and interval algebra with 
qualitative and quantitative functions. Also we apply 
the result of computation models to temporal, 
spatial, spatio-temporal databases for generic 
applications. We define the equality predicates on 
points and intervals to express spatio-temporal 
relations. Spatio-temporal state tables are defined 
for representing spatio-temporal mutation. We also 
develop transformation mechanisms to algebraic 
expressions for computing and query from databases. 
Spatio-temporal computation models can be used in 
many related applications such as digital archive, 
content based image retrieval, multimedia 
synchronization, temporal data mining and 
communication with mobile agents.

Introduction 
Representing spatio-temporal knowledge is an essential part of many computer applications. Researchers of 
artificial intelligence, linguistics, knowledge systems, and information science require a time model for 
knowledge representation and analysis. Allen [1] has proposed an interval framework and Vilain and Kautz [3] 
have proposed a point framework for representing indefinite qualitative temporal information. These 
frameworks are influential and have been applied in diverse areas such as multimedia database [4], composite 
services [5], multimodal analysis of human behavior [6], semantic web [7], and data mining [2]. In this paper, 
two fundamental temporal frameworks are integrated and extended for spatial representations.  
Constraint satisfaction techniques play an important role in current computer science. Many difficult 
problems involving search from areas such as machine vision, scheduling, graph algorithms, machine design, 
and manufacturing can be considered to be the cases of the constraint satisfaction problem. In our previous 
work [8], an Interval Transitive closure Table and constraint propagation algorithms are proposed for temporal 
reasoning. This point-interval algebra is also extended for spatial constraint reasoning. 
2   Representation of Spatio-Temporal Relations 
To deal with qualitative temporal representations, we divide the real number in timeline into three intervals: 
[-, 0], [0, 0] and [0, +]. These three intervals were denoted by {<}, {=} and {>} for representing the 
relationship between two time instants. Based on the encoding of endpoint relations between intervals, the 
well-defined interval relations are summarized as qualitative variables. The time intervals are formally defined 
as follows: 
Definition 2.1: Well-defined Interval 
If P is the set of points and  is the usual ordering on P, then [P; ] is partially ordered. Let a, b  P such 
that a  b. The set {x  a  x  b} is called a well-defined interval of P and denoted as [a, b]. The set {x  a  x 
 b} is called a pure interval, which is the subset of well-defined interval.                                
Definition 2.2: Endpoint Relations 
If P is the set of points, a binary relation  of two points based on point relations {<, =, >}.  Let A:[a, b] 
and B:[c, d] are two intervals, where a, b, c, d  P. The binary relations ab and cd are the duration 
relations. And the binary relations ac, ad, bc, and bd are called endpoint relations. These relations are 
denoted as AsBs, AsBe, AeBs, and AeBe respectively.                                             
Based on qualitative point relations, we use an encoding method to generalize and prove the 13 interval 
exclusion relations. Suppose As and Ae are the starting and ending points of the line segment A. And, Bs and Be 
 4
can be denoted as A (<, <) B, A (<, =) B, A (<, >) B, A (=, <) B, A (=, =) B, A (=, >) B, A (>, <) B, A (>, =) B, 
and A (>, >) B, where the first element in the pair representing a point relation denotes the order on the X 
coordinate while the second is for the Y coordinate. Considering two line segments located on a 
1-dimensional line, the situation becomes complicated. Since each line segment has a starting point and an 
ending point, we analyze the spatio-temporal relations of two line segments according to these points.  
Considering two line segments on a 2-dimensional plane, according to the above table and since the 
position of these two line segments are independent at the X and the Y coordinates, there exists 182 = 324 
possible relations between these two line segments on a plane. These relations, similar to those of two points 
on a plane, are denotes by pairs as: (< , <), (< , >), (< , d), (< , di), ..., (00 , 01e), and (00 , 00). We use these 
324 binary relations to model spatial point-interval relations of two lines on a plane. Suppose XA and XB are 
the projection of two segments A and B (Figure 2). YA and YB are the projection on Y. XA is {start} to XB and 
YA is {before} to YB. We represent the spatial relation between A and B as (A, (s, <),B). 
Relations of n-D objects can be used in object representation and recognition. A object in 3-D space can be 
projected onto y-x, z-x, and y-z planes. The projections correspond to surfaces generated from 3D objects. 
Similarly, a 2-D object is projected to x and y axes (Figure 2).

3   Spatio-Temporal Constraint Reasoning 
We denote by before, equal and after(denoted as {<}, {=} and {>}) for representing relations between two 
points. Qualitative variables take these values only. The notation R1 and R2 denotes the point relations over 
three points A, B, and C which A R1 B and B R2 C. The meaning of some qualitative operators is defined as 
follows. Some values are uncertain and denoted by T. 
Table 2. Addition of qualitative point relations 
R1    R2 < = > 
< < < T
= < = >
> T > >
 
In order to express more precise relations without losing qualitative information, the temporal relations 
extended with qualitative mechanisms for handling quantitative information. To give a concrete form to the 
topic of temporal representation, consider the following variables and equations with quantitative and 
qualitative information.

Definition 4.2: An extended point-interval relation distance (EPIRD) defined with respect to a point-interval 
or interval relation r of index n have n incompatible differences from r. Let R and R are two interval relations 
or point-interval relations. The encoding point relation of R (see Table 1) is RAsBs, RAsBe, RAeBs, RAeBe, and the 
encoding point relation of R is RAsBs, RAsBe, RAeBs, RAeBe. We have a EPIRD formula: 
EPIRD (R, R’) = PRD (RAsBs, RAsBs) + PRD (RAsBe, RAsBe) + PRD (RAeBs, RAeBs) + PRD (RAeBe, RAeBe)

The index of EPIRD with respect to each temporal relation in Table 1 can also be retrieved from the length 
of a shortest path in a distance graph (see Figure 3). For example, relations {d} and {mi} have an EPIRD 
index (i.e., the number of incompatible differences) of 3. Note that, in the distance graph, the shortest path 
between an arbitrary pair of nodes (i.e., relations) has a length between 1 and 8 since the distance graph is to 
represent the similarity of relations of two interval segments. Note that, in the distance graph, there are five 
special edges illustrated in thick curved lines (i.e., from relation 00 to 10e, 01s, e, 10s, and 01e). This is due to 
the fact that, there exists no EPIRD element of index 1 of the 00 relation. A thick curved line has a weight of 2, 
instead of 1 as to the regular cases.
