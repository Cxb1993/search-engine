Abstract 
 
Ceramic-polymer composites are manufactured and studied for their applications 
in acoustic impedance matching.  Various ceramic-epoxy composites are developed 
and their impedance properties studied.  Among them, the zirconium oxide-epoxy 
composite exhibits a tolerable attenuation level and an optimum impedance value for 
matching the piezoelectric ceramic-water interface.  It is then integrated on to a 
home-made medical high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer to test its 
effectiveness.  The beam profile of the HIFU transducer is characterized by a 
hydrophone, and an in-vivo experiment is carried out to gauge its performance.

1. Introduction 
 
Acoustic impedance describes the behaviours of acoustic waves traveling in 
substances, and is given by Z = ρ × c, where ρ is density and c is acoustic wave 
velocity [1].  It plays an important role when one acoustic wave travels across the 
interface between two substances, the larger the impedance mismatch, the more the 
energy loss.  Matching layer is a coating layer to abase the huge difference mismatch 
between two materials – piezoelectric PZT ceramic and water for example, where 
ZPZT = 35 MRayl and Zwater = 1.5 MRayl.  However, the thickness of matching layers 
and their impedance values also affects the efficiency of power transmission.  It can 
be shown that for a monochromatic plane wave, the maximum transmission between 
the PZT ceramic and water with impedances of ZPZT and Zwater occurs for a matching 
layer of λm/4 thickness and of acoustic impedance Zm, where: 
waterPZTm ZZZ =       (1) 
and λm is the wavelength in the matching layer material (see Fig.1) [2].

To determine the acoustic impedance of a material, the wave traveling velocity in 
the material is a necessary parameter.  Therefore, each of the prepared bulk ceramic- 
epoxy composite was cut and ground into a disc sample and adhered on to an 
ultrasonic probe (GE Panametrics Co., USA) using ultrasonic gel for wave velocity 
measurements.  The ultrasonic probe was used to transmit and receive ultrasound 
waves under a pulser-receiver setup.  The reflected wave signals were collected 
using an oscilloscope (Lecroy Co., USA).  Recording the time interval between the 
reflected waves and knowing the sample thickness led to the value of wave velocity 
within the prepared composite matching layer. 
In order to prevent frequency coupling between the transmitting and receiving 
waves within the ultrasonic probe, an external hydrophone (ONDA Co., Taiwan) was 
utilized to receive the acoustic waves emitting from the composite matching layer.  
The hydrophone measurement was set up under water to minimize attenuation and 
maximize the hydrophone efficiency.  Each matching composite sample was set up 
identically on the ultrasonic probe as mentioned above.  After traveling through the 
composite sample, the emitting ultrasonic waves were collected by the hydrophone 
 3
MHz.  The bowl-shape piezoelectric (PZT) element of the transducer had a diameter 
of 10 cm and a curvature radius of 20 cm and was purchased from FUJI Ceramics Co., 
Japan.  The electrical matching circuit of the transducer was built by Broadsound 
Co., Taiwan.  The ultrasonic beam profiles of the transducer, such as the axial and 
lateral pressure distributions, were measured by a hydrophone moving incrementally 
along the axes by a step motor (see Fig. 5).

4. Conclusion 
 
In summary, three different ceramic-epoxy composites are developed and 
compared in terms of acoustic matching characteristics.  Among them, ZrO2-epoxy 
composite is the most suitable material for matching layer applications due to its 
optimum acoustic impedance value for bridging the impedance mismatch between the 
ceramic piezoelectric element and water/human tissues.  A bowl-shape home-made 
HIFU transducer with a single ZrO2-epoxy composite matching layer is manufactured

ABSTRACT 
 
The polarization switching characteristics of lead-free a(Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3–bBaTiO3–c(Bi1/2K1/2)TiO3 (abbreviated as 
BNBK 100a/100b/100c) ferroelectric ceramics are investigated. This is achieved through examining their polarization 
and strain hystereses inside and outside the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). The total induced electrostrain (ε33,total) 
and apparent piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) first increase dramatically and then decrease gradually as the BNBK 
composition moves from the tetragonal phase to the MPB and then to the rhombohedral phase. The measured 
polarization hystereses indicate that the BNBK compositions situated near the rhombohedral side of the MPB typically 
possess higher coercive field (Ec) and remanent polarization (Pr), while the compositions situated near the tetragonal side 
of the MPB possess higher apparent permittivity. Adverse effects on the ferroelectric properties are observed when 
BNBK is doped with donor dopants such as La and Nb. On the contrary, intricate hysteresis behaviors are observed when 
acceptor dopant Mn is introduced into BNBK. Under an alternating electric field of ±5.0 MVm-1, BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, a 
composition well within the MPB, exhibits an ε33,total of ~0.14%, an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1, an Ec of 2.5 MVm-1 and a 
Pr of 22.5 µCcm-2. These notable ferroelectric property values suggest a candidate material for lead-free actuator 
applications. The present study provides a systematic set of hysteresis measurements which can be used to characterize 
the switching behaviors of BNBK-based lead-free ferroelectrics.

D/max-B). In total, 11 types of BNBK composition samples were prepared and Fig. 1 shows their relative positions on 
the room temperature phase diagram of the (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-BaTiO3-(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 ternary system. Samples 1-9 situate 
within the MPB of BNBK and consist of 40 mol% BNBT and 60 mol% BNKT. The exact constitutions of the BNBT and 
BNKT components of a BNBK sample are expressed by the number affixed; for example, Sample 8, which is BNBK 
6.5-20, is of composition 40 mol% (Bi0.5Na0.5)0.935Ba0.065TiO3 + 60 mol% Bi0.5(Na0.8K0.2)0.5TiO3. Note that Sample 8, 
BNBK 6.5-20, can also be denoted as BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 by working out the exact percentages of the three constituents, 
(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3, BaTiO3 and (Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3. Sample 10 (i.e., BNBK 75/5/20) and Sample 11 (i.e., BNBK 90/5/5) are 
two compositions outside the MPB and situate at the tetragonal and rhombohedral regions, respectively. They do not lie 
on the 40 mol%-BNBT-60 mol%-BNKT composition line. Several MPB compositions of the BNBT and BNKT systems 
were also prepared via the same processing route in this study for comparison purposes. For polarization and strain 
hysteresis measurements, sample discs were cut into cuboidal specimens measuring 10 × 10 × 3 mm and silver-based 
paints were applied onto the 10 × 10 mm faces to form top and bottom electrodes for electric field excitation. Electric 
field loading was applied using a high-voltage amplifier (Trek 20/20C), driven by a ferroelectric analyzer (aixACCT 
TF2000). The polarization and strain of the specimen during electrical loading were measured by the ferroelectric 
analyzer and miniature strain gauges (TML FBX-04-11-005LE) attached onto the 10 × 3 mm faces of the specimen, 
respectively. All hysteresis measurements were carried out at room temperature (~ 25 °C) with the specimen contained 
within a silicon oil bath to prevent electrical breakdown.

The stable polarization and strain hysteresis curves for BNBK 90/5/5 and BNBK 75/5/20 are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, 
respectively. Apart from the actuating properties such as ε33,total and d33, the heavily BNT-based rhombohedral BNBK 
90/5/5 also displays a much higher remanent polarization than the tetragonal BNBK 75/5/20. This is most likely due to 
the higher number of equivalent crystallographic directions which the spontaneous polarization could take up in a 
rhombohedral structure (i.e., eight [111] directions). Nevertheless, the magnitude of strain produced by BNBK 90/5/5 is 
still no match for those produced by the compositions well within the MPB. Fig. 4 compares the strain hystereses of 
BNBK 6.5-20 and its two constituent components, BNBT-6.5 and BNKT-20. A substantial 0.20% total electrostrain is 
observed for BNBT-6.5, a composition positioned right in the middle of the MPB of the BNBT system. When BNKT-20 
is introduced into BNBT-6.5 (i.e., forming BNBK 6.5-20), decreases in the electrostrain and apparent d33 are obvious. 
This decline of actuating ability, though, is likely to be rewarded by increases in the depolarization and Curie 
temperatures (20-80 °C increase), as indicated by existing studies.5,10,11 The pure BNKT composition, BNKT-20, exhibits 
a small ε33,total of ~0.05%, much less than those of BNBT-6.5 and BNBK 6.5-20. The values of ε33,total and apparent d33 for 
BNBT-6.5 and BNKT-20 are also listed in Table 2. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the strain hysteresis of a BNBK 
composition combines the straining characteristics of its two constituent components, BNBT and BNKT.
