Abstract
Keywords： nonlinear hydrodynamic analysis, flow induced cylinder vibration, fluid-structure
interaction
The flow induced cylinder vibration might be attributed to (1) the vortex shedding (2)
oscillating cross flow, and there are several major parameters related to the response of the cylinder.
They are geometry, variation of velocity, amplitude, mass ratio, Reynolds number, damping factor
and turbulence intensity etc. The proposed project will study the 2D nonlinear flow induced circular
cylinder vibration. This study is a three-year project.
4As early as 15th century, pairs of wakes behind a circular cylinder were captured in the
drawings, see Fig. 1, of Leonardo, Da Vinci (1452-1519). In the 20th century, the earliest study of
flow around circular cylinder was reported by Blasius in 1908 with a boundary layer theory for a
second order time series solution. The first experimental study was made by Prandtl in 1925. Viscous
flows across a circular cylinder have drawn significant attention during the last three decades.
Collins & Dennis (1973a & b) obtained a higher order boundary layer solution. These two studies
provided a good description for the development of vorticity and flow patterns with the drag force.
Bouard and Coutanceau (1980) reported a much more detailed flow visualization for various
Reynolds numbers, (Re = 2aVo/η, in which Vo = the velocity of the cross flow, ηthe kinematic
viscosity of fluid and a the radius of the cylinder) and discussed the mechanism of the so-called
phenomena and . These numerical results and experiments have provided valuable benchmark
data sets for validations of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithms as well as theoretical
models. The numerical simulation of flow with simple circular geometry is still a very big challenge
because its flow separation, abruptly varied velocity and vorticity development along the impulsive
oscillating cylinder.
Extensive numerical simulations have been reported in the literature. As early as 1958, Payne
reported a numerical method to study the flow past a circular cylinder for Re = 40 to 100. After then,
various numerical methods were developed to solve the problems for higher Reynolds number. A
brief review of numerical methods was made by Li et al. (2004). In both numerical and theoretical
studies, the flow is commonly described by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Such as Ta
Phuoc Loc (1980) used fourth-order finite difference scheme for Re = 550-1100, Ta Phuoc Loc and
Bouard (PL&B, 1985) for Re = 3000 to 9500, Chang and Chen (1991) used hybrid vortex method to
give the solution for Re up to 106, and Koumoutskos and Leonard (1995) also used vortex method to
give high-resolution for Re = 40 to 9500. However, all the above investigations are for cross flow
over a fixed cylinder.
In a study of Dutch et al. (1998), the low Reynolds number and low KC number were used.
In their simulation the Re is around 100 to 200 and the KC number is 5 to 10 and the corresponding
oscillating period of cylinder is 5 sec. or the exciting frequency is as small as 0.2 (1/sec) only. They
discussed the Karman vortex streets, stability of the vortex generation, the drag force and lift force,
and also the validation of the application of Morison equation. Blackburn and Henderson (1999)
studied cross flow past a transverse oscillating circular cylinder with Re = 500 and a small maximum
moving displacement of 0.25a. They solved incompressible Navier-Stokes equations expressed in a
moving coordinate system by finite element method. In the above notable studies, low Reynolds
number (less than 500) and low exciting frequencies were used. Guilmineau and P. Queutey (2002)
used a physically consistent method to study the vortex shedding from oscillating circular cylinder,
two cases were investigated one was in line oscillating in water at rest with Re =100 and KC = 5 and
the other was uniform flow past a transverse oscillating cylinder with Re = 185. Niu et al., (2003)
used Taylor series expansion and least square based lattice Boltzmann method to study the flow past
6where  is the kinematic viscosity.
The definition sketch of the problem is shown in Fig. 1, where a is the diameter of the cylinder, ar is
the distance between the outer boundary and the origin of the polar coordinate system. According to
the results of Ta Phuoc Loc & Bouar(1985), ar greater then 2.5a is appropriate for Re =3000 to 9500,
if the cylinder is fixed. However, as Re increases and the cylinder is in motion, the larger ar would be
needed. r is the radial distance measured from the instant center of moving cylinder and is the
angle between r and horizontal direction. The corresponding flow velocity in r and 
directions are defined as rv  and v and can be calculated through the definitions of velocity and
stream function;

Boundary conditions
The no-slip boundary condition assures the flow velocity on the cylinder surface be equal to the
moving velocity of the cylinder. The boundary condition of the stream function is zero when the
cylinder is fixed. If the horizontal moving velocity of the cylinder is vxc, then flow velocity at the
cylinder face can be described as

Integrating Eqn. (4a) with respect to , we can calculate the stream function along the cylinder face
as

When the outer boundary of the computational domain is far away from the
oscillating cylinder, the vorticity generated from the cylinder will not be transport to the
outer boundary, the flow in this region be used as the boundary condition of stream
function at the outer boundary, i.e.

At T=0, both cross flow and cylinder are at rest. Impulsively, the cross-flow starts to move with

which there does not exist any analytical boundary-layer solution. Ta Phuc Loc tried two different
conditions to simulate his problem. First, the flow is assumed to be initially irrotational with or
without Kutta-Joukowski condition. Secondly, the flow is supposed to be in the Stokes regime, and a
solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for very low Reynolds number gives the initial conditions.
And Ta Phuc Loc concluded their numerical results using the second class of initial conditions
showed better agreement in space and time with those of the experimental results.
In the present study, we, however, used different initial conditions from those stated above and
they are:

All the coefficients Ci are due to coordinate transformation and are listed in the Appendix A.
Besides, VT denotes partial derivative of V with respect to T; the other terms have similar meanings.
The computational advantage of this complicated form of the governing equations is directly related
to the facts that refined meshes are used to simulate the transient boundary layer and they are a
regular fixed mesh, which has smaller errors and better numerical stability for computational analysis.
Furthermore, the time-dependent meshes in the physical domain become time-independent in the
computational domain. Another advantage is the programming simplicity.

computation to assure better numerical accuracy and stability. The present numerical code is written
in a parallel computing mode and is running at an IBM SP2 supercomputer. Considering both
parallel speedup and overhead, we use eight CPU in all simulation cases.
5. Results and Discussions
Before presenting the numerical results obtained by the developed numerical model, a bench
mark test is performed to validate the accuracy of the numerical scheme used in this study.
5.1 Bench mark tests (flow past a fixed circular cylinder, Re = 3000 and 9500)
In this section, the developed finite difference scheme is firstly applied to study the flow across
a fixed circular cylinder and the calculated results are compared with the reported numerical results
and experimental measurements. Figure 4 compares the phenomenon (Re = 3000) obtained by the
present numerical study with those reported by Phuoc Loc & Bouard (1985) and Fig. 5 compares the
corresponding results of phenomenon(Re = 9500) of both studies. As shown in those two figures,
a good accordance is found between experimental and present numerical results. The good
agreements of the comparison demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed novel numerical scheme.
Further numerical validation also can be found in the later sections that several simulations of flow
past cylinder with various oscillating mechanism are studied and they are (a) oscillating flow past a
fixed circular cylinder (Re = 100, KC = 5), (b) flow past a stream-wise oscillating cylinder (Re = 100,
KC = 5), (c) flow past a transverse oscillating cylinder (Re = 500, ymax / D = 0.25), (d) flow past a
rotational oscillating circular cylinder (Re = 500 and 1000) and (e) flow past a simultaneous
stream-wise and transversal oscillating cylinder (Re = 500, KC = 5).
5.2 flow around oscillating circular cylinder (Re = 100, KC = 5)
The flow induced by an oscillating cylinder is complex and the corresponding vortex
development is varied with different conditions of cylinder motion. In 1999, Tatsuno and Bearman
(1990) proposed a flows regimes based on various combination of Re and KC numbers. In this
section, the present numerical model is used to simulate a flow condition corresponding to regime A.
The cylinder is forced to move in east-west (stream-wise) direction in a rest fluid field and the results
are examined for Re = 100 and KC = 5. Figure 6 plots the vorticity isolines at different stages of a
typical oscillating cycle. The stable and symmetric vortex shedding are found and stagnation points
at the front and back of the cylinder are invariant.
We define the Reynolds number is positive when the flow is past a fixed cylinder from west
and the number is negative when the flow is from east. During an oscillating cycle, the flow past
16
the positive vortex still constrained by the uniform flow and a clear kink can be seen in Fig. 8(c).
After then, a strong negative vortex occurs and force positive leave the cylinder surface and it will
shed away by the aid of the uniform cross flow in the later cycles.
Figure 9 plots the drag forces of cases A and B acting on the cylinder versus time. The
equivalent Reynolds number of case A is from Re = 200 to 0 and that of case B is from 100 to -100.
The vortex distributions at the leeward side of the cylinder of both cases are about the same. Since
the uniform cross flow restricts the evolution of vorticity at the windward side of the cylinder and
there is a time lag between the drag forces of cases A and B and the positive drag forces of both cases
are about the same but the negative forces of case A is smaller than those of case B. Also shown in
the figure are the results evaluated by an empirical formula given by Morrison’s equation. As
depicted in the figure, the Morrison’s equation can accurately predict the drag force acting on the
cylinder face of the case B, whereas it underestimates the drag force of the case A during the first and
fourth stages of each cycle.
5.4 Flow past a transverse oscillating circular cylinder (Re = 500, ymax / D = 0.25)
In this section, the uniform flow passing a transverse oscillating circular cylinder is studied
and the results are simulated for Re = 500 and ymax / D = 0.25, the frequency ratio F = 0.89, where
F = fo / fv (fo = forced oscillating frequency and fv = natural shedding frequency). Different
numerical models generate different natural shedding frequencies. The natural shedding frequency
used in Blackburn and Henderson (1999) is fv = 0.228, whereas, the natural shedding frequency
obtained by our model is fv = 0.22. The natural shedding frequency fv = 0.22 is, therefore, used in
this study. Figure 10 shows the vorticity contours around cylinder and a clear Kármán-street
shedding is obtained in this study. The comparison of the results obtained by present numerical
model with those of Blackburn and Henderson (1999) is also shown in the figure and only minor
disagreement is found and it might be due to the different natural shedding frequencies used in both
studies. Fig. 11 depicts the time-series of Cd and Cl and the comparison between present results and
those of Blackburn and Henderson, 1999 and the agreement is also very good. The good agreements
of the numerical comparison imply the accuracy of the proposed numerical model.
5.5 Flow past a rotating circular cylinder (Re = 500 and 1000)
1. In this section, the proposed numerical model is used to study the interaction between uniformly
cross flow and the rotating circular cylinder. The nature of the vortex shedding process can be
significantly altered by cylinder rotation. The rotational oscillating is given asα(t) =α0 sin (ωt),
α0 the maximum angular velocity about cylinder center,ω= 2πf is the angular frequency of
oscillation where f is the frequency of oscillation.

sin 45 o)) oblique to x-direction.
In order to study the repeated flow phenomena, the evolution of the vortices from the third and
the fourth cycles are discussed. We separate each cycle to four quarters: the cylinder is moving in
south-west (SW) direction at the first quarter, in north-east (NE) direction at the second and third
quarters and in SW again at the last quarter of the cycle. For the convenience of the presentation, the
occurrences of the positive and negative vortices are numbered. At the beginning of the 3rd cycle,
three positive vortices and three negative vortices are numbered in Fig. 16(b). At the end of the first
quarter of the third cycle, N4 occurs at the right side of the cylinder and the cylinder is at its
most-SW point and, after then, the cylinder switch its moving direction from SW to NE. The
movement of the cylinder pushes N4 to penetrate P3 and N4 connects with N3 but they remain as
separate vortices. Besides, the clockwise rotating N3+N4 vortices force P3 downward (Fig. 16d). At
the mid of the cycle, the cylinder is back to its starting point and soon after then N5 occurs at the
upper part of the cylinder but it is embraced by positive vortex. N5 increases sharply and diminishes
the ambient positive vortex (Fig. 16e) and P5 occurs at the right-lower part of the cylinder surface.
At the end of the 3rd quarter of the cycle, the cylinder is at its most NE point and N5 covers large part
of the cylinder surface fromθ= 45 o to 202.5o and N3, N4 and N5 all merge together. After then, the
cylinder change its moving direction to SW again and the combined effects of cylinder motion and
the cross flow force connected P4+P5 counter-clockwise roll up and N4 penetrates the connected P3
and P4. N4 is compressed by the separated P3 and P4 to a slim belt and it will fade away and vanish
at the later cycle. Fig. 16g depicts the wake structure at the end of the third cycle. Note that, the wake
structures at the end of 2nd and 3rd cycles are quite different.
At the first quarter of the fourth cycle, N6 occurs at the leeside of the cylinder (Fig. 16h) and it
is embraced by P4+P5. During the second quarter of the 4th cycle, the combined effects of cylinder
motion and clock-wise rotating vortex pairs (N3+N5) push P4+P5 downward. Since N6 is embraced
by strong P4, the breaking of P4 does not occur until the beginning of the third quarter of the cycle
but N6 is moving too low to be connected with N3+N5. However, N6 is still compressed by P4+P5
and a new developed positive vortex P6 (Fig. 16j). At the beginning of the 4th quarter of the cycle,
the cylinder switches moving direction to NE and the combined effects of cylinder motion and cross
flow force P4 and P5 clock-wisely roll up again and N6 is compressed by P4+P5 and P6 and will
also vanish in the later cycle. As shown in Fig. 16b & 16k and Fig. 16g & 16l, the vortex modes are
repeated in every two cycles.
Figuer 17 depicts the time-history of the in-line force (CD, x-component) and lift force (CL,
y-component) acting on cylinder. As shown in Fig. 17(a), the peaks and troughs of the CD history are
repeated every cycle, but the plots between peaks are not repeated every cycle while they repeat
every two cycles. The plots of CL also need two cycles to have a repeated shape. The major
difference of the plots between cycles always occurs at the transition time between the 3rd and 4th
quarters of the cycle and minor (unobvious) difference occurs at the transition time between the 1st

6. Conclusions
A time-independent finite difference method is developed to solve for uniform cross past a
moving circular cylinder. The numerical simulations presented in this study include (1) uniform flow
past a motionless circular cylinder; (2) oscillating flow past a motionless circular cylinder; (3)
uniform flow past a stream-wise oscillating circular cylinder; (4) uniform flow past a transversal
oscillating circular cylinder; (5) uniform past a rotating circular cylinder and (6) uniform flow past a
moving cylinder in simultaneously stream-wise and transverse directions. We have reached the
following conclusions:
(1) The clear phenomenon (Re = 3000) and phenomenon (Re=9500) are obtained and the
numerical comparison of the present results with those reported is very good. The developed
numerical model is validated by extensive numerical comparison of the results obtained by this
study with those reported in the literatures and the agreement of the numerical comparison is
very good.
(2) In the study of oscillating flow past a motionless circular cylinder with Re = 100 and KC = 5, the
cylinder is experienced with a various Reynolds number from +100 to -100 and the positive and
negative vorticity with equal strength are always periodically occurred in the upper and lower
part of the cylinder. Besides, the wake structure at both sides of the cylinder is also periodically
presented. In this case, the Morison’s equation can correctly predict the CD and CL acting on
cylinder.
(3) In the case of uniform flow past a stream-wise oscillating circular cylinder, the cylinder is
experienced with a various Reynolds number from +200 to 0. The uniform flow constraint the
evolution of the wake structure at the windward side whereas the size and strength of the wake at
the leeward side of the cylinder is notably increasing and the positive vortex will shed away at
the end of each cycle. In this case, the Morison’s equation underestimates the CD and CL acting
on cylinder.
(5) In the case of uniform flow past a rotating circular cylinder, the combined effects of the uniform
flow and rotating cylinder will help the shedding of the vortex from the cylinder.
(6) In the case of completed 2D fluid-structure interaction, the uniform flow past a simultaneous
stream-wise and transversal oscillating cylinder is studied. The complicated vortex formation is
found and the combined effects of uniform flow, movement of the cylinder and the rotating
vortices determine the evolution of the wake at both leeside and windward sides of the cylinder.
The wake structures are periodically repeated every two cycles.
(7) The Morison’s formula can not describe the complex interaction phenomenon between cross flow

一、 參訪目的
參加挪威科技大學（NTNU）於 2010 年 6 月 7、8 二日舉行
再生能源學術會議，前往發表本研究團隊部分國科會能源計畫成
果，與國外能源議題作學術上的交流。順道受挪威科技大學
（NTNU）海洋技術系（Depart. Of Marine Tech.）主任 Prof. Hardld
Ellingsen 邀請參訪系上研究環境，進行海洋能源相關經驗與技術
的交流與討論，並尋求後續研究計畫的合作可能性。
二、 參訪團隊與行程規劃
本次會議與參訪交流由本人－陳邦富教授兼系主任領隊，成
員包括：王 醴教授、游明輝教授、黃材成教授及簡連貴教授等
共 5 人。參訪行程由 99 年 6 月 3 日至 6 月 11 日，共計 9 日（行
程內容如表 一）。
3將有助於後續海洋能源研究之合作。結束研討後由 Prof. Hardld
Ellingsen 帶領參觀實驗室，因受商業機密及相關限制無法拍攝。
本次部分團員參加由挪威科技大學（NTNU）主辦之再生能
源學術會議，並發表本研究團隊部份國科會能源計畫部份成果，
因以往一般計畫較少由機械電機領域學者參加，本次研究團隊能
有效整合不同領域進行相關波潮流能源研究獲得與會人員相當
大的重視與迴響。
有關海洋能源開發計畫與經驗交流，經由彼此瞭解挪威及台
灣海洋能源研究及發展重點，尤其挪威科技大學海洋科技系大水
深平本身生產石油在海域工程及探勘技術以累積相當豐富經
驗，另對台灣能發展海洋再生能源尤其是洋流及潮流發電亦深感
興趣。若能藉由合作與台灣團隊負責研究設計，挪威負責水工模
型試驗之驗證，將有助於現場原型試驗或海域測試之推動，對台
灣發展海洋能源有實質幫助。本次交流雙方研究亦獲得初步共
識，期望能朝與中山大學海洋環境系簽訂合作交流協訂，進而推
動國科會能源計劃之合作。
