feelings if a particular product or service item 
is present. As a result, each item belongs to 
one of the four quadrants in IPA. By Kano’s 
model, each item even in the same quadrant 
can be further classified into different quality 
elements.

2. Introduction and Research Objectives 
IPA proposed by Martilla and James 
(1977) was to provide management the 
insights to identify the strengths and 
weaknesses of a company. Moreover, IPA as 
shown in Figure 1 is able to identify the most 
important attributes to the customer with the 
highest impact on customer satisfaction and, 
simultaneously, the low performance 
attributes required to be improved 
immediately (Matzler et al., 2003; Deng et al., 
2008). 
 
 
Figure 1 Importance-Performance Analysis 
 
These four quadrants consist of “keep 
up the good work” (Quadrant I), “possible 
overkill” (Quadrant II), “low priority” 
(Quadrant III), and “concentrate here” 
(Quadrant IV) (Daniels and Marion, 2006; 
Deng et al., 2008). Attributes in Quadrant I 
have both high performance and high 
importance and can be considered as the 
opportunities to achieve or maintain 
competitive for organizations. Quadrant II 
has high performance but low importance, 
which indicates that the resources committed 
to these attributes are excessive and should 
be deployed elsewhere. Quadrant III has the 
characteristics of both low performance and 
low importance, and these attributes do not 
require additional efforts. Finally, attributes 
located in Quadrant IV with low performance 
but high importance are viewed as major 
weaknesses for an organization. Immediate 
attention for improvement is required. 
A typical approach of applying both 
IPA and Kano’s model is to use separate 
questions to receive the needed information. 
That is, two questions are required for each 
item in order to plot IPA figures, namely 
importance and performance of a particular 
item. In addition, a pair of questions are 
required for each item when Kano’s model is 
applied, i.e., with and without a particular 
item. In this project, a hybrid 
Kano-questionnaire proposed by Chen and 
Su (2006) is introduced to integrate with IPA. 
A typical hybrid Kano-questionnaire is 
provided in Figure 2. In doing so, three 
questions are required for each item. 
Therefore, as the number of items increases, 
the number of questions can be reduced more 
significantly.

3. Methodology 
In this project, an integrated approach of 
IPA and Kano’s model is proposed to reduce

By observing both Figure 4 and Table 2, 
each item can be determined to be “keep up 
the good work”, “possible overkill”, “low 
priority” or “concentrate here” as well as to 
be “must-be”, “one-dimensional”, 
“attractive” or “indifferent.” For instance, 
items 19-22 are in Quadrant I and can be 
viewed as the strengths of the coach 
company as shown in Figure 4. In addition, 
Table 2 reveals that items 19-22 belong to 
one-dimensional quality attributes. Since 
these items are the major strengths and 
belong to one-dimensional quality attributes, 
it is of interest to further prioritize their 
importance. In this case, the “importance” 
value can be the measurement to decide the 
importance. Therefore, the importance can be 
ranked as follows: item 19 > item 20 > item 
21 > item 22. 
Generally, the proposed approach first 
reduces the number of questions used in the 
survey by simultaneously applying 
importance-performance analysis and Kano’s 
model and then gathers the needed 
information to draw IPA plots and perform 
Kano’s classification. Specifically, the 
importance of each item can be identified by 
one of the four quadrants. The quality 
attribute for a particular item can be further 
classified by Kano’s classification. It would 
be easier for a decision maker to outline the 
importance and implementation procedures 
based upon the above information. If the 
items are located in the same quadrant with 
the same Kano’s classification, the 
“importance” value for each item can be the 
final key index to classify the importance of 
items. Therefore, the results of this project 
provide a total solution when this proposed 
approach is used in service industries. 
 
5. Self-Assessment of This Project 
First, we have completed successfully 
what we addressed in the proposal of this 
project. Second, the procedure of integrating 
IPA and Kano’s model is discussed 
practically in the earlier section. Third, the 
results have been published in conferences 
and journals. Specifically, there are one SSCI 
journal paper, one EI journal paper, one 
international conference paper, and two 
domestic conference papers. Please refer to 
Ref. 1, 2, 4, 9, and 10. Overall speaking, the 
output of this project is prolific.

會議時間地點 2009年 1月 8-10日 / Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, Singapore 
會議名稱 The 2009 International Conference on e-Commerce, e-Administration, e-Society, and e-Education (e-CASE 2009) 
發表論文題目 Using Importance-Performance Analysis to Improve E-Learning Quality 
 
一、參加會議經過 
2009年 1月 8日早上搭乘長榮 BR225班機由桃園抵達新加坡。研討會的
Pre-Conference registration雖在當天 4:30PM – 6PM舉行，不過並沒有參加，而是在 1月
9日早上到 Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel報到，接下來則是參與研討會活動。該旅館
提供的場地雖不是很大，卻蠻精緻的，由旅館全程準備點心與飲料，相當的方便。不過
因為旅館所在位置距離捷運站有段距離，只能夠以計程車往返，這是較不理想的地方。
整個研討會主要論文發表活動共兩天，即 1月 9-10日，主題包括 e-Commerce, 
e-Administration, e-Society, and e-Education，因此簡稱 e-CASE。此外今年又加入
e-Technology，使得這個研討會的主題更為多元。每天各有四個時段發表論文，其中第一
天 10:20AM- 11:50PM還舉辦一場 International Forum on Higher Education，一同討論亞太
地區高等教育的未來發展與挑戰。在結束兩天的研討會活動後，於 1月 11日下午搭乘長
榮 BR226班機返回台灣，結束整個研討會行程。 
 
二、與會心得 
這是個人首次參與由 International Business Academic Consortium與 Knowledge 
Association of Taiwan主辦、國立臺北大學、實踐大學及新加坡 SIM大學協辦的 e-CASE
研討會。整個研討會最大的特點在於所包含的主題非常的廣泛，而此次作者所撰寫的論
文是利用 Importance-Performance Analysis改善數位學習(E-Learning)品質的個案，因此被
收錄在 e-Education類。透過此研討會有機會觀摩不同類型與研究之論文，有助於了解非
自己研究領域的研究主題，增廣視野與專業知識，是一次非常好的學習之旅。再者，此
研討會也提供研討會論文擇優刊登於期刊的機會，包括 International Journal of Business 
and Information, International Journal of Cyber Society and Education，讓人更有動機想參
與。最後，主辦單位非常的用心宣傳 2010年的研討會：The 2010 International Joint 
Conference on e-CASE and e-Technology，將於 2010年 1月 25-27日在澳門舉行，論文截
止收件是在今年 9月 15日，有助於規劃參與明年度的研討會。 
 
answering to the open-ended question. Eighteen important quality attributes were 
extracted based on an information system success model discussed by DeLone and 
McLean (2003). A questionnaire using these 18 items were developed. For each 
question, the importance was evaluated by a Likert-type five-point scale, where 1 and 
5 represent the very unimportant and very important, respectively. In addition to the 
importance, the performance in each question was performed by the same instrument, 
where 1 and 5 mean very dissatisfactory and very satisfactory, respectively. 
 
The survey was conducted during June 24-July 6, 2008 with 1436 invitational emails 
sent by the computer center of the university to students enrolled in an online course 
during the survey session. A total of 336 questionnaires were received with the valid 
response rate of 23%. The overall reliabilities of importance and performance 
measured by Cronbach’s a were 0.95 and 0.97, respectively. The construct validity 
was performed by the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin statistic of 0.966 and Bartlett’s test of 
sphericity of 2c  = 10674.28 (P-value = 0.000). Additionally, the cumulative 
variance explained by the factors accounted for 66% of the total variances. 
 
Table 1 summarizes the information regarding these 18 attributes in performance and 
importance. Figure 1 depicts how all attributes are located in this two-dimensional 
grid. Six items located in Quadrant I can be viewed as the major strengths, including 
items 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, while The major weaknesses identified in Quadrant 
IV are 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 18. Therefore, the managers of the e-learning system should 
allocate more resources to improve these major weakness attributes.
