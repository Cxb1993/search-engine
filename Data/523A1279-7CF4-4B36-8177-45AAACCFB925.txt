Softened Membrane Model for PC Members under Torsion
計畫主持人：國立暨南大學土木工程學系 鄭全桓
INTRODUCTION
A new rational torsion model for reinforced concrete (RC) members called the Softened Membrane
Model for Torsion (SMMT) has recently been proposed [1-4]. The SMMT model can predict the entire
torque-twist curve including the cracking point. This represents a significant advancement beyond
previous torsion theories, which were only capable of predicting the “post-cracking”behavior. This
study further extends the SMMT to treat prestressed concrete (PC) members subjected to pure torsion.
The prestressing creates a complex initial stress state for PC torsional members. Previous torsion
theories circumvent the initial stress state by bypassing the pre-decompression stage. This study
modified the SMMT to incorporate the initial stresses due to prestressing. Additional terms
representing the initial stresses are incorporated into the equilibrium equations. The constitutive
relationships are modified to accommodate the initial stresses. The modified SMMT for PC members
is used to predict the torque-twist curves of 12 specimens [5], showing good agreement with tests.
ANALYTICAL MODEL
Initial Stress State due to Prestressing
The prestressing creates a longitudinal initial compressive stress  0ci in the concrete, which is
equilibrated by the initial stresses in the mild steel and prestressing steel. The initial equilibrium
equation along the longitudinal direction is

Initial Strain due to Prestressing
The prestressing creates a longitudinal initial compressive strain  0 lili  (Eq. (1c)) both in the
concrete and mild steel. This initial longitudinal strain induces identical initial strains in the 2- and 1-
directions; i.e. liilii   12 , .
Constitutive Relationship of Concrete in Tension
The uniaxial tensile stress-strain relationship of concrete proposed by Wang (2006) [6] is modified to
incorporate the strain gradient effect.

ANALYTICAL RESULTS COMPARED WITH TESTS
The computer program based on the modified SMMT for PC members was used to predict the
response of 12 test specimens reported in [5]. The following figures compare the SMMT-predicted
torque-twist curve (dotted curve) with the experimental curve (solid curve) for the 12 specimens.
These figures show that the analytical curves agree with the experimental curves reasonably well. The
discrepancy between the analytical and experimental curves is generally the steeper post-peak
descending branch in the experimental curves possibly attributed to cover concrete spalling. The
current SMMT theory does not consider the effect of concrete spalling.
