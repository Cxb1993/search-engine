message transmission problem and three-party 
authenticated key distribution 
problem respectively. 
These protocols use quantum bits to transmit message 
and distribute secret key. 
Moreover, these quantum protocols can detect the 
eavesdropper by the 
disturbances of quantum bits and uses the quantum bits 
error rate to estimate 
information leakage. 
And finally, a process called {\em quantum key 
evolution} is used to obtain a 
secure key, which can be used in the next time. 
We verify the security of the proposed protocols by 
standard problem reduction. 
We show the security of our schemes is equivalent to 
QKD protocols. 
 
Based on the results we already have, our future work 
can be divided into 
short-term, middle-term and long-term goals. 
We are going to extend our research results in the 
following two ways: (1) to 
apply our current results to improving some quantum 
cryptographic schemes that 
have been proposed； (2) to enhance the proof 
techniques on the security of 
cryptographic protocols.

1 簡介
量子密碼學是利用量子力學的特性以達成
安全通訊與資訊保護. 現代密碼學是使用
傳統的資訊, 這些資訊容易被複製, 而且對
於竊聽者複製傳送資訊的行為是無法察覺
的. 相反的, 量子密碼系統最重要的特性則
是利用量子位元的狀態改變以偵測出竊聽
者的存在. 更重要的是利用量子態的改變
量能估算資訊的洩漏量, 以處理具有雜訊
(noise) 的實際環境, 結合錯誤更正 (error
correction) 與隱私增強 (privacy amplifica-
tion) 的非量子理論技術, 建立資訊理論安
全 (information-theoretically secure) 的密
碼系統.
量子金鑰分配協定解決了私鑰 (private
key) 分配的問題, 這是量子密碼學中被研
究最多的問題. 量子金鑰分配協定有許多
不同的實現方式 [4, 1, 15, 9], 它能為已完
成身份驗證的通訊雙方建立一把資訊理論
安全的金鑰. 因此身份驗證一直是量子密
碼學中一個重要的問題 [12, 14, 27, 31].
然而, 在 Lo [24] 與 Colbeck [11] 的研究
中指出, 在兩方安全計算 (two-party secure
computation) 的問題上, 參與計算的兩方
要以各自的資訊共同計算獲得結果, 如果
最後結果僅由單一方獲得, 稱為 one-sided
two-party computations, 這種計算是不能
達到安全定義的要求. 也就是先獲得結果
的一方可以欺騙另一方並且推算出另一方
原先的資訊. 以此結論推論出:若通訊雙方
不能公平地 (fairly) 相互驗證對方的身份,
不存在安全的身份驗證協定. 這個結論為
設計安全的量子身份驗證協定樹立了一個
障礙.
本計畫目前完成四篇論文, 其中有兩篇
會議論文 [19, 18] 已被接受發表. 這兩篇論
文分別討論量子金鑰演化與量子位元傳送
訊息時資訊洩漏量的問題. 另外兩篇期刊
論文 [21, 20] 都已投稿到國際期刊進行審
查中. 兩篇期刊論文中, 我們針對訊息傳送
問題與三方認證的金鑰分配問題提出解決
問題的協定, 並且都給予正式的安全性證
明.
從我們目前的研究成果以及投稿國際期
刊所獲得的審查意見, 我們發現許多未來
可能的研究議題. 在近程目標, 我們發現一
些發表的量子密碼協定是在理想無雜訊的
條件下, 因此我們將以目前的研究成果為
基礎, 對這些量子密碼協定進行改進, 設
計出在有雜訊的條件下的量子密碼協定.

原始金鑰 (raw key) 的長度為 n 位元. 竊聽
者獲得的原始金鑰資訊少於 l 個位元. 隱
私增強可將原始金鑰壓縮為長度 m 位元的
最後金鑰 (final key). 此處 m = n − l − s,
其中 s > 0 是一個安全參數. 此時竊聽者
對最後金鑰的資訊量少於 2−s/ ln 2 個位元.
選用適當的參數 s, 隱私增強技術能夠使得
竊聽者獲得最後金鑰的資訊量降低到趨近
於零. 應用在我們的方案中的金鑰演化步
驟是隱私增強技術的一個應用.
2.2 量子位元的洩漏資訊量分析
目前提出的量子密碼協定大多數仍是處
理傳統位元的資訊. 一般量子位元是定義
在二維 Hilbert 空間中. 一個量子位元具
有基底與測量值（簡稱為值）. 因此, 目
前的量子密碼方案的一個量子位元定義
為攜帶兩個傳統位元的資訊, 一個是基底,
另一個是值. 一個傳統位元在公開通道
(public channel) 傳送時, 攻擊者可以獲得
一個位元的資訊. 一個量子位元在量子通
道 (quantum channel) 傳送時, 攻擊者可以
獲得多少位元的資訊? 這是我們想要探討
的問題.
在研究這樣的問題時, 我們探討一些關
於量子金鑰協定的個別攻擊的文獻. 最佳
個別攻擊時, 攻擊者自選一個量子系統, 稱
為探測器 (probe), 攻擊者在傳送的每個量
子位元糾纏一個探測器. 攻擊者可以對探
測器執行符合量子力學原理的任何操作以
獲取通訊雙方的資訊. 這種攻擊方式與分
析最早是由 Fuchs 等人提出 [16].
在 Gisin 等人的論文 [17] 對於 BB84 協
定進行分析, 推導出當量子位元錯誤率不
高（小於 0.2）時, 攻擊者獲得的最大資訊
量 I 與量子位元錯誤率 D 大約呈現線性成
長的關係:
I =
2
ln 2
D +O(D)2 ≈ 2.9D.
由這個關係, 通訊者將可以由量子位元錯
誤率估計出洩漏的資訊量.
2.3 量子安全直接通訊
量子安全直接通訊的問題是探討: 已經認
證身份的兩個通訊者, 在沒有共有其他資
訊的情況下, 一方如何直接傳送訊息給另
一方. 與量子金鑰分配協定不同的是直接
傳送的是特定訊息, 不是一把隨機產生的
金鑰. 因此, 如果存在有竊聽者時, 通訊雙
方即使偵測到竊聽者, 還必須注意傳送的
資訊是否有部份被竊聽者獲得.
大多數的量子安全直接通訊協定使用
量子糾纏態. 第一個以量子糾纏態設計的
量子安全直接通訊協定 [7] 是 Bostro¨m 與
Felbinger 提出, 又被稱為 ping pong 協定.
大多數的量子金鑰分配協定的量子位元僅
從通訊一方送至另一方. 然而, ping pong
協定的量子位元則是在通訊雙方間來回的
傳遞. 雖然能夠增加偵測竊聽者的機率, 但
是通訊雙方則需要同時具有接收與發送量
子位元的能力.
除了使用量子糾纏態以外, 也有一些協
定使用沒有糾纏的量子位元設計量子安全
直接通訊協定, 大多數的方案也需要雙向
的量子通道 [13, 29, 25, 32], 也就是量子位
元需要在通訊雙方中來回傳送. Hwang 等
人 [23] 的協定則僅使用單向的量子通道,
但是接收者需要量子位元儲存設備, 也就
是需要量子記憶體 (quantum memory) 的
技術才能實現.
現有的量子直接安全通訊協定都僅考慮
通訊時偵測竊聽者的機制以及避免通訊內
Page 4
增強則是將竊聽者可能獲得金鑰的資訊完
全消除.
許多研究論文提出了對於量子金鑰分配
或量子安全直接通訊問題的解決方案. 其
中許多研究的貢獻在於提出了不同的方案
以偵測竊聽者或提高量子位元的利用率.
然而, 有一些僅適用於沒有雜訊的情形, 或
是提出的方案僅具有偵測竊聽者的能力,
而沒有考慮產生金鑰或傳送訊息的一致性
與可能洩漏少許的資訊. 我們認為設計一
個完整的量子密碼協定應該具有完整的架
構以確保系統的整體安全性. 未來我們將
針對一些方案加以改進, 延伸我們的研究
成果.
3.2 量子位元錯誤率與資訊洩漏
量子密碼系統雖然具有偵測竊聽者的能力,
當量子位元錯誤率超過設定的錯誤率門檻
值時, 竊聽者將會被發現. 然而, 當量子位
元錯誤率低於設定的錯誤率門檻值時, 並
不能保證竊聽者是不存在的. 應用量子位
元錯誤率在量子密碼系統上, 最重要的功
能應該是估算通訊雙方可能洩漏資訊量的
上界, 然後決定後續處理的步驟, 以保證系
統的安全. 這裡必須考慮安全的資訊應該
包括產生的金鑰, 傳送的訊息或是通訊各
方共有的資訊, 例如共有的私鑰等.
在沒有雜訊的理想狀況下, 我們可以將
所有的擾動都歸因於攻擊者. 但是在有雜
訊的環境下, 攻擊者能夠在雜訊的掩護下,
獲取少量資訊而不被發現. 藉由評估量子
位元錯誤率, 通訊雙方能計算出洩漏的資
訊量, 並且決定後續處理的步驟: 放棄這次
傳送或者是應用古典錯誤更正或隱私增強
方法, 以獲得安全的資訊. 因此, 量子密碼
系統的量子位元錯誤率門檻值 (threshold)
是一個在實際環境下重要的安全指標.
我們的研究是利用四種量子態構成的量
子系統. 令 |0〉 與 |1〉 為兩個量子態, 它們
形成一個計算基底 (computational basis).
定義
|+〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉+ |1〉)
與
|−〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉 − |1〉).
定義
R = {|0〉, |1〉}
及
D = {|+〉, |−〉}
為兩個基底. 定義 |0〉 與 |+〉 對應於古典
位元 0; |1〉 與 |−〉 對應於 1. 我們稱 0 與
1 為量子位元的值. 在這種四態量子系統
(four-state quantum system) 中, 每個量子
位元具有兩個古典位元的資訊, 一個是基
底, 另一個是它的值.
攻擊者攔截四態量子系統的一個量子位
元, 我們的研究 [18] 獲得以下結論:
1. 若攻擊者沒有取得有關於量子位元基
底或值的資訊, 攻擊者能夠經由測量
最多得到這個量子位元 0.399 位元的
資訊.
2. 若攻擊者取得有關於這個量子位元值
的資訊, 攻擊者最多能夠得到這個量
子位元基底的資訊量是 0.399 位元.
這個結論告訴我們:以四態量子系統的量
子位元傳送訊息時, 某個古典訊息位元以
量子位元編碼, 必須隨機使用四種量子態
才能確保量子位元的訊息不會洩漏. 所以,
以固定的基底來傳送訊息, 如果這個基底
使用多次, 這個基底將會被推導出來. 如
Page 6
D. 根據文獻 [17, 26] 的定義, 若
I(A;E) ≥ I(A;B)
且
D ≤ 11%,
則 E 破解 BB84 協定.
以資訊量與量子位元錯誤率定義我們提
出協定的安全性. 若通訊雙方某一次以 n
個量子位元傳送訊息. 在我們使用的四態
量子系統中, 一個量子位元具有兩個古典
位元資訊. 攻擊者 Eve 造成的量子位元錯
誤率低於協定定義的門檻值且獲得超過 n
個古典位元, 則稱 Eve 破解了我們提出的
協定. 這個定義是根據我們提出的金鑰演
化的條件. 更詳細地說, 若 Eve 獲得超過 n
個古典位元的資訊, 則通訊雙方由 n 個量
子位元所獲得的互資訊, 將不足以再產生
一把安全的金鑰做為下一回合使用.
以標準問題約化方法證明安全性, 我們
要證明兩件事情:
1. 每一個 BB84 協定的實例 (instance)
有一個對應於我們提出協定的實例.
2. 若存在破解我們提出的協定的攻擊者,
證明有一個攻擊者 X 能破解 BB84 協
定的實例.
4 研究成果自評
在這個三年的研究計畫中, 目前我們完成
了四篇論文, 其中兩篇已刊登在會議論文
集中, 另外兩篇正投稿在國際期刊審查中.
如前面的研究成果所述, 我們發現一些能
夠將本研究成果擴展的研究議題, 我們將
繼續進行研究, 延伸我們的研究成果.
在投稿國際期刊的經驗中, 我們發現必
須充分明瞭本身研究的貢獻, 還必須熟悉
投稿的期刊所接受的研究範圍與目標. 對
於量子密碼研究有興趣的期刊分佈於物理
學, 密碼學, 資訊科學與數學等領域, 然而
不同領域的研究興趣範圍卻有所差異. 例
如, 物理學的期刊對於量子密碼研究大多
著重於特定技術的發展與應用, 目前在理
論上著重於糾纏態方面的研究與應用方案,
實驗上也有相當多的論文. 而在以密碼學
或數學為主的期刊中, 安全性方面的定義
與證明則是最主要的貢獻. 在以資訊安全
相關的資訊科學期刊則會對於設計一個密
碼系統的整合性有興趣. 此外, 目前國際上
以量子資訊與量子密碼為主要收錄的期刊
有以下三個,
1. Quantum Information & Computation.
2. Quantum Information Processing.
3. International Journal of Quantum In-
formation.
他們對於以上的研究都有興趣, 而且研究
的創新性與證明要求都很高.
這三年中我們對於研究的領域已有相當
的瞭解, 不過我們並沒有充分延伸我們的
研究成果. 未來我們將以這三年的研究成
果為基礎, 先進行一些已發表的量子密碼
系統的改進, 增加本計畫研究成果的累積.
然後進行以公平性條件為前提的量子密碼
系統設計與理論方面的研究, 特別是安全
性的證明. 以期望在量子密碼研究上, 未來
能趕上先進國家的研究水準.

Abstract
We study the issue of information leakage in transmission of secret
message by using quantum bits (qubits) against individual attacks.
Quantum bits have some different properties from classical bits, such
as no-cloning and measurement. We show that using qubits to trans-
mit secret messages in an insecure quantum channel has advantage in
information security. That is, the quantum scheme leaks less infor-
mation than one-time pad. We also discuss some issues on designing
scheme to transmit secret messages using qubits.

mation leakage; Message transmission.
1 Introduction
Transmission of secret message is an important task in cryptography. Assume
that the two communicating parties share a secret key. The sender, Alice,
can encrypt a secret message by the secret key and transmit the encrypted

without information on the basis of the qubit. Therefore, the communicating
parties can detect eavesdroppers with a high probability. On the contrary,
there are no ways to detect in classical cryptosystems if the attacker copies
the transmitted messages or not.
Let us consider the scenario that Alice and Bob share a binary secret
key K = k1 . . . kn and they would like to transmit a binary secret message
M = m1 . . .mn using a qubit sequence Q. The following is a simple scheme to
transmit secret message using qubits. Let X = K⊕M . Alice and Bob agree
on the generating Q = q1 . . . qn by using the K and X. Let |0〉 and |1〉 be two
orthogonal quantum states. Let |+〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉+ |1〉) and |−〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉− |1〉).
Let R = {|0〉, |1〉} and D = {|+〉, |−〉} be two mutually unbiased bases. For
i = 1, . . . , n, the ki determines the basis of qi and a different state chosen in a
basis is decided by the value of xi. Table 1 lists the states to create qi. Alice
Table 1: Creating qubit qi.
qi xi = 0 xi = 1
ki = 0 |0〉 |1〉
ki = 1 |+〉 |−〉
sends the qubit sequence Q to Bob. Bob measures the qubit qi according to
the value of ki and obtains the outcome xi, for i = 1, . . . , n. He computes
M = K ⊕X.
We investigate the information leakage about K and M in the above
simple quantum scheme. We assume that Eve performs an individual attack
to obtain the information on Q in this paper. That is Eve attacks the Q one
qubit after another. Two results of this paper are listed as follows.
1. Eve cannot obtain individual information on the secret key K.
2. Eve can obtain 0.399n bits of information on the secret key K and the
secret message M , more precisely, K ⊕M .
As compared to the classical method, i.e. one-time pad, the attacker Eve can
obtain n bits of information on K and M . Our simple quantum scheme leaks
less information on K and M .

mation leakage in the two-state QKD protocol [2] respectively. The BB84
protocol [3] is a four-state QKD protocol. Huttner and Ekert [13] analyzed
the probability of success, induced error rate, and information gain in at-
tacking the BB84 protocol using intercept-resend strategy. Fuchs et al. [8]
introduced an optimal strategy to attack QKD protocol. They attach a quan-
tum system, called a probe, to the intercepted qubit. The intercepted qubit
is sent to the receiver. And then the attack measures the probe to obtain
the maximum information and reduce the error rate after some information
about the qubit is revealed. Williamson and Vedral [16] studied two beam
splitting attack and photon-number splitting attack. Their analysis applied
the results of intercept-resend attack and optimal strategy. Gisin et al. [10]
surveyed the QKD protocols comprehensively. Many techniques to analyze
information leakage are well described.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some fundamental tech-
niques are described in Section 2. We describe our main result in Section 3.
We discuss some issues on designing scheme to transmit secret message using
qubits and conclude this paper in Section 4.
2 Preliminaries
Quantum cryptosystems use qubits to distribute or transmit information.
The quantum no-cloning theorem shows that a qubit with an unknown state
cannot be copied. One will alter the state of a qubit with a high probability if
he does not know its original state. The communicating parties have a high
probability to find the eavesdropper by checking for changes in quantum
states. An example of this is given below.
Let |0〉 and |1〉 be two orthogonal quantum states. Let
R = {|0〉, |1〉}
be a basis, called the computational basis. Define
|+〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉+ |1〉),
|−〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉 − |1〉).
5
or |−〉 with probability 1
2
respectively. If Eve sends the measured qubit to
Bob, Bob measures the received qubit in the basis R and gets |0〉 or |1〉 with
probability 1
2
respectively. Finally, Alice tells Bob the qubit is |0〉. If Bob
gets |1〉 after he measured it, they discover the qubit has been changed by
someone.
Suppose Alice sends n qubits to Bob. Each qubit was randomly cho-
sen from the four states {|0〉, |1〉, |+〉, |−〉}. If Eve intercepts all the qubits,
measures them by randomly choosing R or D, and then sends the measured
qubits to Bob, on average she would induce an error with probability 1
4
for
each qubit [13, 16]. The attack is called intercept-resend attack. In an ideal
quantum channel, we can assume all disturbances come from Eve. Assume
Alice and Bob randomly check l qubits to see if there are any errors. Then
the probability for Eve to be detected is 1− (1− 1
4
)l = 1− (3
4
)l. The proba-
bility is close to 1 if the value of l is large enough. To reduce the probability
of being detected, Eve should intercept less qubits. However, this strategy
also reduces the amount of information she could acquire by eavesdropping
on the transmission.
3 Information leakage
We first describe Lemma 1 that is used to analyze information leakage in
transmission of secret messages. Theorem 2 shows the information leakage for
the simple quantum scheme. Lemma 3 shows an upper bound of information
leakage on the basis of qubit if the value of qubit is revealed. Lemma 3 can
be used to analyze the information leakage in eavesdropper detection.
Assume that Alice would like to send two traditional bits (b, v) secret to
Bob by using a qubit |q〉. Let R = {|0〉, |1〉} and D = {|+〉, |−〉} be the
possible bases of the qubit. Let |0〉 and |+〉 correspond to 0, and let |1〉 and
|−〉 correspond to 1. Alice creates |q〉 according to (b, v) and sends it to Bob.
The value of b denotes the basis of |q〉 and the value of v is the value of |q〉.
Table 3 lists the states to create |q〉.
Eve intercepts |q〉. In order to get information about |q〉, Eve has to ma-
nipulate |q〉 to learn the secret (b, v). Fuchs et al. [8] introduced a method
7
follows.
Let {M0,M1} be a set of Eve’s measurement operators.
M0 = |ϕ0〉〈ϕ0|,
M1 = |ϕ1〉〈ϕ1|.
Here the indexes 0 and 1 refer to the measurement outcomes; |ϕ0〉 and |ϕ1〉
are two states given by
|ϕ0〉 = cos θ|0〉+ sin θ|1〉,
|ϕ1〉 = sin θ|0〉 − cos θ|1〉,
where θ is a variable angle taken counterclockwise from |0〉. To identify the
four states by {M0,M1}, we divide the four states into two groups, each
outcome indicates one group, and randomly choose a state from the group.
There are three possible grouping methods.
First, let 0 indicate the group {|0〉, |+〉}, and 1 the group {|1〉, |−〉}. The
probability of distinguishing the state correctly is
Pc =
1
4
[
1
2
(〈0|M0|0〉+ 〈+|M0|+〉) + 1
2
(〈1|M1|1〉+ 〈−|M1|−〉)
]
. (1)
Substituting M0 and M1 into equation (1), we have
Pc =
1
4
(
cos2 θ +
1
2
+
1
2
sin 2θ
)
. (2)
To maximize Pc with respect to θ, it gives θ = pi/8 and P
max
c = 0.427. After
the qubit is measured by {M0,M1}, Eve knows that the qubit |q〉 is in one of
states {|0〉, |1〉, |+〉, |−〉} with probabilities {0.427, 0.073, 0.427, 0.073}. Thus,
the Shannon entropy Ha posteriori ≥ 1.601. We have
I(A;E) = Ha priori −Ha posteriori
≤ 2− 1.601 = 0.399. (3)
Here I(A;E) denotes Eve’s information gain on the secret. By the grouping
method, Eve’s information is on the value of v.
In the second grouping method, we can let 0 indicate the group {|0〉, |−〉}
and 1 the group {|1〉, |+〉}, the maximum probability of distinguishing the
9
Without loss of generality, we can assume that b = 0 and v = 0. Hence,
the qubit |q〉 sent by Alice is |0〉. Eve intercepts the qubit and measures it in
basis R and D randomly. Eve can learn the value of b if she has chosen D to
measure the qubit |0〉 and Bob measures the qubit sent by Eve to get v = 1.
When Alice and Bob publicly check the value of v to find it wrong, Eve knows
that she has chosen a wrong basis to disturb the qubit. The probability of
getting the value of b is 1
4
and Eve gets one bit of information. Therefore, on
average Eve obtains 0.25 bits of information on the value of b in an attack.
Lemma 3 shows an upper bound of Eve’s information gain on the value of
b if she performs an optimal individual attack and the value of v is revealed.
Lemma 3. Assume that |q〉 is prepared by Alice as described above. Eve
intercepts |q〉, attaches a probe to |q〉 and then sends |q〉 to Bob. If the value
of |q〉, i.e. v, is revealed, on average Eve can learns at most 0.399 bits of
information on the value of b.
Proof. Eve measures the probe to obtain information on the basis of |q〉. If
v = 0, the |q〉 should be |0〉 or |+〉; otherwise the |q〉 should be |1〉 or |−〉.
Hence, two possible states of |q〉 are remained instead of four possible states.
That is, Eve has to distinguish |q〉 between two states instead of four states
by measuring the probe of |q〉. Suppose that Alice announces v = 0. Eve has
to distinguish between |0〉 and |+〉. The maximum probability to distinguish
correctly is cos2(pi/8) ≈ 0.854. Similarly, she has to distinguish between |1〉
and |−〉 if v = 1. The maximum probability is also 0.854. Hence, Eve can
obtain at most
Ib(A;E) = 1−H(cos2(pi/8)) ≈ 0.399 (6)
bits of information on the basis of |q〉, i.e. the value of b. Here H(·) is the
binary Shannon entropy.
For the sake of completeness, we briefly describe the result of the infor-
mation leakage on the value of qubit if the basis of qubit is revealed. The
result has derived by Gisin et al. [10] in their analysis of Eve’s information
gain on the BB84 protocol. Eve can attach a probe on the intercepted qubit
11
can use the announced random numbers and the values of qubits by attach-
ing probes to the qubits to deduce some information of the secret message.
Although the information of the secret message deduced by Eve are proba-
bilistic, the secret message can be revealed by accumulating the information
in a sequence of attacks. To solve this issue, the random numbers cannot
be revealed. Therefore, we combine the secret key with the secret message
as the values of qubits. Since Eve has no information on the secret key, she
cannot break the secret message even if she has some information on the
values of qubits.
The amount of information leakage is useful in the decision of whether
the secret key has to be discarded or not. The communicating parties can
use the quantum bit error rate (QBER) to estimate the information leakage
so that they can evaluate how much information of the secret key is leaked
if the scheme aborts. Noise effect is a practical issue in quantum channels.
Noise not only makes some errors in the message received by the receiver
but also can be a mask of the attacker. We believe that the QBER and
error correction codes are useful tools to help the communicating parties
competing against eavesdroppers and noise. As we mentioned before, the
secret key has to be updated after it is used once. An efficient key evolution
method is necessary for a message transmission protocol. These issues will
be discussed in our full version paper.

We present a quantum message transmission protocol, called QMT, for two parties to
send very long secret messages. We use quantum bits as message carriers to reduce
the information leakage and combine the techniques of error correction and privacy
amplification to ensure the message being intact and confidential. We show that the QMT
protocol is information-theoretically secure and uses less quantum bits than the method
of combining quantum key distribution (QKD) with one-time pad to send classical bits.
We also formally prove that the security of QMT protocol is equivalent to the security
of QKD protocols.

We show that Eve cannot deduce the message from the information obtained in
the classical and quantum channels. We also show that the security of the QMT
protocol is equivalent to the security of BB84 protocol.
In order to compare the hybrid method with our protocol, we first review the
well-known QKD protocol (BB84 protocol) proposed by Bennett and Brassard in
1984 3 and its variants, which enhance the efficiency of BB84 protocol. And then
we present the idea and the efficiency of the QMT protocol.
In the BB84 protocol, the communicating parties use two bases to create qubits.
They establish a random secret key by choosing the bases of qubits randomly. The
bases of qubits are announced and about half of the qubits, which have different
bases, are discarded. The remaining qubits are used to do error checking and to
create a secret key.
To increase the efficiency of BB84 protocol, Lo et al. presented an efficient QKD
scheme in which Alice and Bob use an extremely biased probability to choose the
bases for reducing the fraction of discarded qubits (hereafter called LCA proto-
col) 22. Compared with BB84 protocol, the efficiency of LCA protocol is asymptot-
ically doubled. Deng et al. proposed the delayed measurement to increase the effi-
ciency of random-choice-based quantum communication protocols (hereafter called
DLWX protocol) 12. The qubits are not measured until the bases of qubits are
announced. Therefore, the qubits have to be stored. Their scheme can avoid dis-
carding qubits, thus its efficiency is doubled as compared to BB84 protocol. These
two approaches double the efficiency compared with BB84 protocol without sharing
any information in advance.
Hwang et al. 18 proposed a QKD scheme without public announcement of bases
(QKD without PAB) to increase the efficiency of BB84 protocol. In their scheme,
however, Alice and Bob have to share a random bases sequence in advance. They
use the bases sequence to create and measure the qubits. The qubits thus do not
require being stored and discarded so that QKD without PAB saves half of the
qubits compared with BB84 protocol. The authors claimed that the bases sequence
could be used to distribute keys repeatedly. However, they did not discuss the step
of error checking in QKD without PAB. In Section 3, we show that repeatedly using
the same bases sequence to encode qubits is not secure if some information on the
qubits is revealed to do error checking. The step of error checking, which ensures
the attackers obtain only little information about the qubits, is a necessary step in
a QKD scheme. Thus, it is not secure for QKD without PAB to create a long secret
key by using short secret key repeatedly.
The idea of our QMT protocol can be briefly described as follows. We do not
assure that Alice and Bob share a secret key in advance. Therefore, Alice and Bob
have to create a secret key first. This can be done by using a QKD protocol or
any other methods. Alice uses this key to encode a message into qubits and sends
the qubits to Bob. After Bob gets the message, they combine the original key and
the message to create a new key so that Eve has almost no information about the

the integrity requirement for solving the message transmission problem, the two-
way QSDC protocols are less efficient than the one-way protocols. Furthermore,
the HLL protocol, a one-way protocol, needs quantum memories to store qubits.
Compared with these QSDC protocols, our QMT protocol needs only a one-way
quantum channel. It is more efficient and does not need quantum memories.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces quantum states used
in this paper. Section 3 describes two possible attacks on QKD without PAB. Our
QMT protocol are presented in Section 4. We also compare the amount of qubits to
transmit messages using the QMT protocol with those of using the hybrid approach
of BB84 protocol and one-time pad. The security of the QMT protocol is proved
by standard problem reduction to BB84 protocol in Section 5. Section 6 concludes
the present work.
2. Preliminary
In this section, we introduce quantum states used in our protocol and some nota-
tions. We use the following four quantum states to transmit classical bits. Let |0〉
and |1〉 be two orthogonal quantum states. Define
|+〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉+ |1〉)
and
|−〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉 − |1〉).
Let the two basis R and D be
R = {|0〉, |1〉}
D = {|+〉, |−〉}.
Let |0〉 and |+〉 denote the classical bit 0, and let |1〉 and |−〉 denote 1. We call 0
and 1 the values of qubits, R and D the bases of qubits. We note that each qubit
encodes two bits of classical information. One is its basis, and the other is its value.
To distinguish symbols between a string and a single value, we use bold font
to represent a string and regular font to represent a single value. For example, an
m-bit string is denoted by x = x1x2 . . . xm.
3. Attacks on QKD without PAB
Assume that Alice and Bob have already shared a binary secret key b = b1 . . . bn.
They repeatedly use b to create a long key by QKD without PAB 18. We present
two possible attacks on QKD without PAB. Thus, QKD without PAB is not secure
to create a long secret key by using b repeatedly.
Suppose Alice would like to send an n-bit random sequence a = a1 . . . an to Bob
by qubits. They agree on the secret key b as the basis of the qubits. Alice creates

Lemma 1. Let |qi〉 be a qubit generated by using Table 1. Here bi is the basis of |qi〉
and ai is called the value of |qi〉. Eve intercepts |qi〉 and has no other information
about it except |qi〉 ∈ {|0〉, |1〉, |+〉, |−〉}. She can obtain 0.399 bits of information
on ai by measuring |qi〉.
Proof. Let {M0,M1} be a set of Eve’s measurement operators.
M0 = |ϕ0〉〈ϕ0|,
M1 = |ϕ1〉〈ϕ1|.
Here the indexes 0 and 1 refer to the measurement outcomes. The two states |ϕ0〉
and |ϕ1〉 are given by
|ϕ0〉 = cos θ|0〉+ sin θ|1〉,
|ϕ1〉 = sin θ|0〉 − cos θ|1〉,
where θ is the angle taken counterclockwise from |0〉. Let the outcome 0 indicate
states {|0〉, |+〉}, (i.e. ai = 0), and 1 indicate {|1〉, |−〉}, (ai = 1). The probability
of guessing the ai correctly is
Pc =
1
4
[(〈0|M0|0〉+ 〈+|M0|+〉) + (〈1|M1|1〉+ 〈−|M1|−〉)] . (1)

Maximizing Pc with respect to θ gives θ = pi/8 and P

c = 0.854. Thus, Eve’s
Shannon entropy on the ai after measurement is H(0.854) ≈ 0.601. Let Iai(A;E)
be Eve’s information gain on the ai, which equals the relative entropy decrease:
Iai(A;E) = 1−H(0.854) ≈ 0.399.
The analysis shows that Eve can obtain 0.399 bits of information on ai.
The above proof shows that Eve can learn some information on the value of
qubit by measuring the qubit directly. For a specific binary string a = a1 . . . an

To transmit κm bits of messages by the QMT protocol, the messages are divided
into dκm/ue blocks each with u bits. It needs 4n qubits in preparation phase to
establish an m-bit key using BB84 protocol first. In message transmission phase,
dκm/uem qubits are required. Totally 4n+dκm/uem qubits are required to transmit
κm bits of messages.
Table 4 lists a comparison of transmitting a long message of κm bits between
the QMT protocol and the other protocols introduced in this paper. We assume
that all protocols use the same error detection and error correction method. In
order to reconcile their raw keys, QKD protocol has an information reconciliation
procedure. This procedure can be done by linear error correcting code. Most QSDC
protocols have not considered the integrity issue of message. We suggest to deal
with the issue using linear error correcting code.
In Table 4, the second column (Qubits needed) shows the amount of qubits
needed to send a long message of κm bits. The third column (Fractions of BB84)
shows the amount of qubits needed by the protocol taking the qubits used by BB84
protocol to be 1. Here we assume that the κ is large. In the calculation, we let
m = n/2 in QKD protocol and v = m/2 in our QMT protocol. Because we make
all schemes having the same conditions:
Half of the qubits are used for error detection and privacy amplification
shortens half of the key.
We shall discuss more on the selection of error detection method in the last section.
The fourth column (Qubits stored) shows whether the protocols need quantum
memories or not.

In an ideal quantum channel and therefore error correction code is not required,
Alice and Bob can set e = ε = 0 so that transmitting m-bit plaintext needs n qubits,
i.e. a fraction α = 0.25 of qubits of BB84 protocol, if the scheme succeeds. However,
the scheme aborts even if Eve disturbs a few qubits. This causes the transmission
to fail and waste the shared key and the qubits.
The advantages of using error correction codes are to deal with disturbances
from noises of the quantum channel and Eve eavesdropping a little qubits. A well-
known quantum error correction codes, the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes,
need at least five physical qubits to encode one logical qubit 25. Since we are sending
traditional information, not quantum information, we use traditional error correc-
tion codes, which is, by now, much more efficient than the quantum error correction
codes.
We assume that the binary BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenhem) codes to cor-
rect errors. Some examples of codes of length 255 are given as follows. When using
these codes, the QMT protocol divides the code word into blocks of length 255.
The (255, 231) code to correct 3 errors is an example if the tolerable quantum bit
error rate is 0.01. The threshold e is set as b(m − v) × 3/255c. A practical frac-
tion of qubits needed is (255/231) × 0.25 = 0.276 of BB84 protocol. The fraction
is less than the theoretical bound 0.291 as we mentioned above. If the tolerable
quantum bit error rates are 0.05 and 0.1, the (255, 155) code to correct 13 errors
and the (255, 87) code to correct 26 errors are required in the QMT protocol. The
thresholds are b(m− v)× 13/255c and b(m− v)× 26/255c respectively.
4.2. Key evolution
The key evolution is a main ingredient of the QMT protocol. When a message
encrypted by a key is transmitted, information leakage of the key and the message
is unavoidable even if qubits are used as we mentioned in Section 3. Hence, the key
has to be updated. We propose key evolution to update the secret key. The key
evolution is inspired by privacy amplification 6,4. The idea is to pad the original
secret key with a string in which Eve has learnt only very little information and
then to shorten it to an m-bit string. Our method is to combine the key and the
message, which are of 2m bits, and to shorten the 2m-bit string by a universal hash
function to generate a string of length m. By the theorem of privacy amplification 6,
the information obtained by Eve can be reduced to less than one bit. Therefore,
Alice and Bob can use this new string as their new secret key.
Privacy amplification can be regarded as a distillation technique. More precisely,
assume that Alice and Bob share a string with n-bit length and Eve obtains l
bits of information about this string. Let s > 0 be a security parameter. Privacy
amplification shortens the string to m bits, where m = n− l− s. As a result of this
change Eve has less than 2−s/ ln 2 bits of information about the m-bit string. If s
is chosen properly, almost no information about the resulting m-bit string is learnt
by Eve.

notations about Eve’s optimal information gain in different cases and gives their
upper bounds.
Let I1 denote Eve’s optimal average information gain (in coherent attacks) about
each bit of the raw key in BB84 protocol. By the formula given by Lo and Chau 21,
Hwang et. al. 17 calculated
I1 ≤ −[D log2D + (1−D) log2(1−D)], (2)
where D denotes the quantum bit error rate. We note that D is a secure parameter
in BB84 protocol and in our QMT protocol as well. We recall that I1 is Eve’s
optimal average information gain on the values of qubits whose bases are revealed.
Let I2 be Eve’s optimal average information gain (in coherent attack) about
the basis of each check qubit in the QMT protocol. Recall that the values of check
qubits are revealed to estimate error rate. As we mentioned in Section 3, Eve can
get some information about the basis of the qubit if its value is revealed. We show
that the calculation of Hwang et. al. 17 about Eve’s information can also be used
in this case. Since Eve’s information I2 is bounded by the von Neumann entropy
S(ρAB),
I2 ≤ S(ρAB),
and ρAB = TrEve(σABE), where σABE is the state held by Alice, Bob and Eve right
before the final measurements of Alice and Bob; TrEve(·) denotes the partial trace
over Eve’s system. Eve maximizes S(ρAB) for a certain D. The maximum entropy
occurs when all states which give D are with equal probability. Thus
I2 ≤ log2 Ω, (3)
where Ω is the number of distinct states in ρAB which give a certain D. In the
calculation of Hwang et. al. 17, the value of D depends on the bases used in the
scheme. Alice and Bob check errors by basis D or R in the QMT protocol, which
is the same in BB84 protocol. Thus, the calculation of log2 Ω is also valid for the
check qubits in the QMT protocol. This concludes
I2 ≤ −[D log2D + (1−D) log2(1−D)]. (4)
Let I3 be Eve’s optimal average information gain (in coherent attack) about the
value of each data qubit in the QMT protocol. Since no information about the data
qubits in the QMT protocol is revealed, the case is the same as the qubits that
generate raw key in QKD without PAB, Eve’s optimal information (in coherent
attacks) about raw key of each bit in QKD without PAB can be denoted by I3 as
well. Hwang et. al. 17 have showed that
I3 ≤ I1. (5)
Let I4 be Eve’s information gain about the basis of each data qubit in the QMT
protocol. Since no information about the data qubit is revealed, Eve cannot obtain
any information about the basis of the data qubit. That is
I4 = 0. (6)
August 30, 2011 22:43 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE tr022.2

Thus, we have
−[D log2D + (1−D) log2(1−D)] <
v
m
. (10)
For example, if D = 0.05, v/m > 0.287 and D = 0.1, v/m > 0.469. In fact, the
number of check qubits is no more than half of the total qubits in most quantum
cryptographic schemes, so v/m ≥ 0.5. When the tolerable quantum bit error rate
D becomes larger, we can shorten the length of check qubit to meet the condition.
5.2. Security proof
The above analysis is based on coherent attack, which is the most powerful attack
known today. However, no one has shown that this is the most powerful attack
possible. We show that for any attack, our QMT protocol is at least as secure as
the BB84 protocol by proving that the security of BB84 protocol is reducible to
the security of our QMT protocol. BB84 protocol has been proved to be secure and
consequently our QMT protocol is secure.
Theorem 3. Assume that there exists an attacker Eve to break the QMT protocol.
Then there exists an attacker X who can break BB84 protocol.
Before we prove Theorem 3, two definitions are given as follows. Let X be an
attacker of BB84 protocol. The following is the definition of X breaking BB84
protocol.
Definition 1. 14,24 Let I(A;B) and I(A;X) denote the mutual information ob-
tained by Bob and X from Alice on sifted key in BB84 protocol respectively. Let
D denote the quantum bit error rate created by X. X breaks BB84 protocol if
I(A;X) ≥ I(A;B) and D ≤ 11%.
Let Eve be an attacker of the QMT protocol. We have the following definition
of Eve breaking the QMT protocol.
Definition 2. Eve breaks the QMT protocol if Eve creates less than e errors in
the check qubits and obtains the values of k and g at least m bits.
We justify the definition is reasonable as follows. If the QMT protocol aborts,
Alice and Bob discard the original key and run a QKD protocol to generate a new
key. Eve’s information about the qubits in this transmission was in vain. Therefore,
the definition of breaking the QMT protocol for Eve can be defined by obtaining
enough information of qubits without being detected. She thus can get some infor-
mation on the evolved key after the key evolution step. Since the security of the
QMT protocol is based on the security of the key, Eve can use the information in
the next transmission to get more information about the transmitted message and
the key. We recall that g = x⊕ r and r is announced if the QMT protocol is suc-
cessful. Therefore, if Eve could learn m bits of information on the k and x without

When the bases of qubits are revealed, the states needed to be distinguished are
orthogonal for each individual qubit. For example, if the basis of a qubit is R,
the state of the qubit is |0〉 or |1〉. The two orthogonal states can be distinguished
exactly. On the other hand, when the values of qubits are revealed, the states needed
to be distinguished are not orthogonal for each individual qubit. For example, if the
value of a qubit is 0, the state of the qubit is |0〉 or |+〉. The two non-orthogonal
states cannot be distinguished exactly. Therefore, the probability to distinguish
qubits whose bases are known is greater the probability to distinguish qubits whose
values are known.
Since there exists an attacker Eve to break the QMT protocol, she can obtain
at least ((1− I3)× v/(m− v))× n bits of information and induces (e/(m− v))× n
errors if the bases of n qubits are revealed. In BB84 protocol of distilling n-bit sifted
key to obtain final key, X knows the bases of n qubits of the sifted key. X calls Eve
to distinguish these n qubits. Thus,
I(A;X) =
(1− I3)× v
m− v
≥ [1 + [D log2D + (1−D) log2(1−D)]]× v
m− v . (11)
X needs to obtain information
I(A;X) ≥ I(A;B) = 1−H(D) ≥ 0.5
and induces QBER
D =
e
m− v ≤ 11%.
Thus
I(A;X) ≥ 0.5v
m− v ≥ 0.5. (12)
Therefore, we have v ≥ 0.5m.
We show an attacker X breaking BB84 protocol by calling Eve, who can break
the QMT protocol with the condition of v ≥ 0.5m.
6. Conclusions and Discussions
Using qubits to send classical information has the advantages that Eve cannot learn
all the information about the qubits if she does not know the bases of the qubits
in advance. Furthermore, Eve must induce errors on the qubits if she learns some
information about the qubits. However, some information about the qubits may still
be leaked. If the values of the qubits are revealed for error checking, some bases
information may be leaked. Even if no information on the bases and the values
of the qubits is revealed, Eve can intercept the qubits, do some measurements,
and learn some information about the values of the qubits. Therefore, in using a
quantum system to transmit classical messages, the bases of the qubits have to be

More precisely, each qubit used in the QMT protocol, as well as in the QKD
protocols, has four states, thus it can encode two bits of information—one is the
basis and the other is the value. However, each qubit still transmits one-bit of
classical information. In the BB84 protocol, the bases are announced. The value
of each qubit, whose basis is the same in the two communicating parties, is used
either to establish the final key or to detect errors. Therefore, only some of the
qubits are used to establish the key. On the other hand, in the QMT protocol,
after a short key of length m is established, the bases are the secret between the
two communicating parties and the values of qubits are used to send message or to
detect errors. Moreover, both of the information of the bases and the values are used
in this transmission and they are used to create a new key for the next transmission
as well. That is, the information of bases and values of qubits can be used for two
purposes in the QMT protocol. Therefore, to create a new m-bit key by using key
evolution in the QMT protocol uses less qubits than the QKD protocols. This is
why the QMT protocol can send a long message with fewer qubits.
Why is the key obtained by the key evolution procedure secure? Since each
qubit encode two bits of information, in sending m qubits, we have 2m bits of
secret information in the QMT protocol. If Eve gets only a little information on
the 2m bits of the secret, as we mentioned in Section 4.2, shrinking the 2m bits
of secret by a factor 2, one can get a secure m-bit string. We have shown Eve can
obtain a little information on the 2m bits of the secret. Therefore, a new secret key
can be generated by the key evolution in the QMT protocol.

Abstract
Recently, Hwang et al. proposed two three-party authenticated quantum key
distribution protocols which enable two communicating parties to establish
a session key via a trusted center (TC). The two parties share no common
secret initially, but each party shares a secret key with the TC. This paper
presents two protocols to improve some issues which have not been addressed
in the protocols proposed by Hwang et al. These issues include the session key
consistence, the online guessing attack, and the noise in quantum channel.
To deal with these issues, we use error correction codes and present a new
idea called key evolution. For the security of our protocols, we give a formal
standard reduction proof to the security of our protocols, without using the

1. Introduction
Bennett et al. have proposed quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols
which enable two authenticated parties to establish a random key without
initially sharing a common secret [1, 2, 3, 4]. The security of these QKDs are
based on quantum physics, and they have been proved unconditionally se-

certain number of times. The third issue, the noise in quantum channel, is
an important practical issue to implement a quantum cryptosystem.
We briefly introduce the techniques used in our protocols. The detailed
discussions on these techniques will be shown in Section 2. When using
quantum bits (qubits) as carriers to send classical information, the adver-
sary, Eve, cannot obtain much information without being detected. One can
estimate the information leakage by using quantum bit error rate (QBER)
to detect the adversary. We use error correction codes and a key verification
process to assure the consistency of the session key. The error correction is
also used to overcome the noise. Finally, this work presents a method, called
key evolution, to update the secret key efficiently. The key evolution is based
on the principle of privacy amplification [15, 16]. Key evolution is necessary
because repeating using the same key is not safe.
The security of 3AQKDP and N3AQKDPs needs to consider both the
session key established between the two communicating parties and the se-
cret keys shared between the TC and the parties. The security of 3AQKDP
is concerned with the session key and is proved by using the random oracle
model. However, using random oracle in the proof of the security of a pro-
tocol is debatable. Canetti et al. have shown that there exist signature and
encryption schemes that are proved to be secure in the random oracle model,
but no secure implementation can exist [17, 18].
We give the security definition of the N3AQKDPs, which is similar to
that of the BB84 protocol, as follows. Assume that Eve has no information
about the shared secret keys. If Eve attacks the N3AQKDPs without being
detected, then her information on both the session key and the shared secret
keys is negligible. We prove the security of the N3AQKDP2 by standard
reduction to the BB84 protocol. Since the BB84 protocol has been proved
unconditionally secure, our proof by standard reduction to the BB84 protocol
proves the security of the N3AQKDP2 against general attacks.
We note that the security definition is based on the successful termination
of protocol. A little information on the session key and the shared secret keys
will be leaked if the 3AQKDP or N3AQKDPs aborts. The session key is not
used if the protocol aborts and a new session key will be selected in the next
session. Thus no security issue of the session key occurs. However, the shared
secret key is a long-term key if it is not updated. Therefore, the information
of the shared secret keys leaked to Eve can be accumulated. Eve thus may
learn the shared secret key after several attacks. It is worthwhile to study how
much information on the shared secret key is leaked if the protocol aborts.

basis. Suppose that Alice and Bob communicate using the qubits. Assume
that they know the bases of the qubits, then they can check the states of the
qubits to detect whether Eve has eavesdropped in quantum channel or not.
Combining this property with random sampling test, a quantum cryptosys-
tem can estimate the error rate in quantum channel. This technique allows
Alice and Bob to estimate Eve’s information gain by the error rate. If the er-
ror rate is below the tolerant threshold, it means that not much information is
leaked to Eve. Then they can correct errors in their communicating messages
and eliminate Eve’s information gain using privacy amplification. Otherwise,
the error rate is high. It implies that Eve can get much information, so they
should abort the current protocol.
We also use random sampling test and the privacy amplification in our
protocol. First we briefly describe the random sampling test. Assume that 2n
qubits are randomly divided into two groups, test-bit and data-bit. Although
they need not be equal, we assume that each group has n qubits in our
protocol. The random sampling test allows the communicating parties to
estimate an upper bound of the error rate in the data-bit group on the basis
of the test-bit group. More precisely, for any δ > 0 and large n, if the
error rate in the test-bit group is less than δ, then the probability of the
error rate more than (δ+ ǫ) in the data-bit group is asymptotically less than
exp[−O(ǫ2n)] [21]. Therefore, the error rate of the test-bit group can be used
to estimate the error rate of the data-bit group.
It is well known that Eve must be able to learn some information during
the communication even qubits are used. The technique of privacy ampli-
fication can be used to reduce Eve’s mutual information on the secret to a
desired level of security if the information leakage is not too much. The idea
is to shorten the length of the secret to eliminate Eve’s information. A the-
orem of the privacy amplification [15] can be described as follows. Assume
that Alice sends an n-bit secret to Bob, and Eve learns l bits of information
about the secret in the transmission. Let s > 0 be a security parameter
and let m = n − l − s. Alice and Bob can shorten the secret to m bits to
reduce Eve’s information on the secret to be less than 2−s/ ln 2 bits. One can
properly choose s such that Eve has almost no information about the m-bit
secret if n > l. The privacy amplification can be efficiently performed by a
universal hash function [22, 13]. Alice chooses a hash function from a class
of universal hash functions family and announces it publicly. It needs only a
little information to identify the chosen hash function [15].

4. The TC sends QTA and QTB to Alice and Bob respectively.
5. Alice receives QTA and measures it according to KTA. If (KTA)i = 0,
R is used to measure the (QTA)i; otherwise D. Similarly, Bob measures
QTB using R or D depending on KTB.

7. Alice and Bob verify the values of UA and UB. They accept the session
key if the values of UA and UB are correct.
Hwang et al. [14] proved the security of 3AQKDP under the random oracle
model and addressed that 3AQKDP suffers the online guessing attack. The
security of 3AQKDP is defined as the advantage of the adversary attacking
the session key Ks. Since RTA = h(KTA · rTA)⊕ (Ks ·UA ·UB), Eve needs to
call the hash function to get the value of h(KTA · rTA) if she wants to break
the Ks. They have shown the advantage is negligible to break the security of
3AQKDP. However, the definition does not include the security of the shared
secret key. When Eve attacks the secret key using the online guessing attack,
she does not need to call the hash function. We show that Eve can attack
the 3AQKDP without calling the hash function in the next subsection.
3.2. Issues on 3AQKDP
In this subsection, we discuss three issues on 3AQKDP mentioned in
Section 1.
We first present an attack on 3AQKDP that the session keys obtained
by Alice and Bob may not be consistent even if the values of UA and UB are
7
gets 0.25× 1+ 0.75× 0 = 0.25 bits of information in each attack. Thus, Eve
can get a little information on the shared secret key with a non-negligible
probability. The worst thing is that Eve can obtain the secret key one bit
after another in the online guessing attack. Therefore, Eve’s information on
the long-term secret key can be accumulated. If the long-term secret key is
not updated, it can be broken by Eve after about 4n attacks. If it needs
to update frequently, then the key cannot be regarded as a long-term key
anymore.
The third issue is on the noise in quantum channel. In a noiseless envi-
ronment, all qubits disturbances are induced by Eve. One may be concerned
with whether there exist eavesdroppers or not. The 3AQKDP is designed in
a noiseless quantum channel. However, a practical implementation is always
in a noisy environment. Eve can hide herself by the help of noise.
3.3. Resolve the issues
We describe the ideas to deal with these issues in our protocols. Our
protocols estimate the error rate in quantum channel. We use error correction
codes to correct session keys. 3AQKDP suggests updating the secret key to
address the online guessing attack. A trivial method to update the secret
key is to create a new key. We propose a key evolution method to update
the secret key, which is more efficient than creating a new secret key. Our
key evolution method is derived from the principle of privacy amplification.
We show that Eve has almost no information about the new secret key.
To overcome the noise, we have to estimate the error rate, and then cor-
rect the error to get the original information. Disturbances in a quantum
channel come from the adversary and the environment. To consider a noisy
quantum channel, some error correction methods have to be used. Quantum
error correction is used to protect quantum information from errors. The
Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are well known quantum error correc-
tion codes. According to the quantum Hamming bound, the CSS codes need
at least five physical qubits to encode one logical qubit [21]. Since our goal is
to establish a classical session key by qubits, it is more efficient to correct the
session key by using classical error correction codes if the number of errors
can be estimated.

Our protocols can be divided into the following eight steps: message
encoding, qubits generation, qubits transmission, message decoding, eaves-
dropper detection, error correction, key consistence verification and key evo-
lution. The steps between the TC and Alice are depicted in Figure 3. The
thick line in step 3 denotes the quantum channel. The thin lines in step 5 in-
dicate the classical public channel. The only difference between N3AQKDP1
and N3AQKDP2 is the step 5, eavesdropper detection. In N3AQKDP2 the
TC announces TA and Alice announces SA; and in N3AQKDP1 the TC an-
nounces TA and hash function h, and Alice announces the value of h(SA)

be the string constructed by (yB)i arranged in order, for all i ∈ TB. The
TC chooses a hash function h from a class of {0, 1}v → {0, 1}w universal
hash functions and announces it. Here w < v is a security parameter
chosen by the TC. Alice announces h(SA) and Bob announces h(SB).
The TC makes comparisons. If h(SA) = h(TA) and h(SB) = h(TB),
they go to step 6. Otherwise, the TC aborts this session.
6. (Error correction) Let DA be the string constructed by (yA)i arranged
in order, for all i ∈ CA. Note that YA is a combination of DA and SA.
Similarly, let DB be the string constructed by (yB)i arranged in order,
for all i ∈ CB. The TC notices Alice and Bob to correct DA and DB
using error correction code Cvu so that DA = DB = C. Hence Alice and
Bob can obtain the session key Ks.
7. (Key consistence verification) Alice determines the current time, time.
She computes V1 = eKs(UA · time) and sends V1 to Bob. Here eKs is
an encryption algorithm using the session key Ks and ‘·’ denotes string
concatenation. Bob decrypts V1 using Ks, obtaining time. Then, Bob
computes V2 = eKs(time + 1) and sends V2 to Alice. Alice checks that
dKs(V2) = time+ 1. Here dKs is a corresponding decryption algorithm
using the session key Ks. If this condition holds, they go to step 8.
Otherwise, Alice aborts the session.
8. (Key evolution) The TC chooses a hash function f from a class of
{0, 1}
3
2
n → {0, 1}n universal hash functions and announces it. The TC
and Alice compute K ′
TA
= f(KTA ·C) as their new secret key. The TC
and Bob compute their new secret key K ′
TB
= f(KTB · C).
Alice verifies her session key with Bob’s session key in step 7. Although
error correction can let their session key be consistent in most instances,
there exist a few probabilities which the number of errors in DA is much
more than that in SA such that DA 6= C. The case may also occur in Bob’s
communication with the TC. The key consistence verification step ensures
their session keys to be consistent. The step is similar to the verification
process in Kerberos-type session key distribution schemes. Since the Ks is
used as a session key, this step dose not compromise the security of the Ks.
We compare the amounts of qubits and classical bits needed in N3AQKDP1
with those in 3AQKDP. In N3AQKDP1, the TC uses 2n qubits to establish
a u-bit session key for Alice and Bob. The classical messages are transmitted
13
DA should be very small if no error is found in the SA. The N3AQKDP1
thus finds eavesdroppers if there exit any errors in the SA and SB by the
hash function instead of estimating the error rate. The method of checking
whether there exist any errors or not leaks less information than that of
estimating the error rate.
In N3AQKDP2, we consider the errors caused by the quantum channel.
When the number of errors caused by the environment and Eve is below
the threshold value e, the N3AQKDP2 succeeds and the users obtain the
session key. For a fixed noise, we assume the number of errors induced
by the environment is below a constant. A large e can thus tolerate more
disturbances induced by Eve. However, for a fixed u, the length of the Ks, it
needs more bits to correct more errors. Therefore, a larger v and more qubits
is needed to send Ks if we expect the protocol can resist more disturbances
from Eve.
The following examples show the selections of e and the error correction
codes. Suppose that the binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenhem (BCH) codes
of length 255 are used. Assume the error rate caused by the environment
is 0.01. If the error rate caused by the adversary is 0.01, the total error
rate is 0.02. Then the [255, 207] code to correct 6 errors can be used and
e = ⌊ v
255
× 6⌋ in our protocol. If the error rate induced by the adversary is
0.04, the total error rate is 0.05, then the [255, 155] code to correct 13 errors
can be chosen and e = ⌊ v
255
× 13⌋. For a concrete example, let v = 255. The
protocols can set e = 6 to transmit 207-bit Ks using 510 qubits if it endures
errors with an overall error rate 0.02. If the overall error rate is 0.05, let
e = 13, then 510 qubits can transmit 155-bit Ks.
Suppose the session key is used to encrypt messages by the Advanced En-
cryption Standard (AES), Table 3 shows the parameters to establish session
keys with lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits in the N3AQKDPs. In Table 3,
the values of u, v and e are the length of Ks, the length of code word and
the tolerable number of errors, respectively. The re denotes the total error
rate. The third and fourth columns are the binary BCH codes to correct t
errors which are chosen in the N3AQKDPs. We recall that the number of
qubits needed is n = 2v.
5. Security proof
We prove the security of the N3AQKDP2 by standard reduction to the
BB84 protocol. Theorem 1 shows that the security of the BB84 protocol can
15
They employ the procedure of information reconciliation to reconcile their
sifted keys and the procedure of privacy amplification to obtain a m-bit final
secret key from the n-bit sifted key.
Let X be an adversary of the BB84 protocol. If X could break the BB84
protocol, he had to let the protocol succeed and got more information than
Bob. Hence, X ’s information gain on the final key was not negligible after
the privacy amplification. Definition 1 gives the definition of breaking the
BB84 protocol.
Definition 1. Let the mutual information obtained by Bob and X from Alice
on sifted key in the BB84 protocol be I(A;B) and I(A;X) respectively. The
quantum bit error rate created by X is D. X breaks the BB84 protocol if
I(A;X) ≥ I(A;B) and D ≤ 11% [26, 11].
Because our protocols treat the qubits and the strings as two parts, we
define the following notations. Let C[X ] = {xi|i ∈ CA} and T [X ] = {xi|i ∈
TA}. Here X can be the qubit sequence QA and strings KTA, GA, HA, XA
and YA. For example, C[QA] = {(qA)i|i ∈ CA} and T [QA] = {(qA)i|i ∈ TA}.
Let Eve be an adversary of the N3AQKDP2. If Eve could break the
N3AQKDP2, the protocol succeeded and she got enough information on the
secret key and the code word that would not be completely eliminated after
the key evolution. We note that the length of the secret key is n bits, the
length of the code word is v bits and n = 2v. In order to update the secret
key, a key evolution procedure is performed in our protocols. Let l denote
Eve’s total information gain on theKTA and the code word C. Recall that the
universal hash function f is chosen from {0, 1}
3
2
n → {0, 1}n. By the theorem
of the privacy amplification [15], the security parameter s = 1
2
n − l > 0.
Hence, the new key K ′
TA
= f(KTA · C) is secure if l <
1
2
n = v. Definition 2
gives the definition of breaking the N3AQKDP2.
Definition 2. Assume that Eve attacks the qubits QA sent from the TC to
the user A. Eve breaks the N3AQKDP2 if she creates less than e errors in
the T [QA] and gets at least v bits of information on the secret key KTA and
the code word C.
Theorem 1 is proved as follows.
Proof. We need to show two things. The first thing is that an instance of the
BB84 protocol has a corresponding instance of the N3AQKDP2. And the
second thing is that we show a X who can break an instance B1 of the BB84
17
the qubits in the T [QA] to obtain the information on the bases of the T [QA].
For example, she can attach probes on the qubits and measure the probes
after the values of the T [QA] are announced. Thus, she can obtain maximum
information on the bases of the T [QA] and induce minimum error rate. This
attack is the same as the method proposed by Fuchs et al. [28] except the roles
of basis and value are exchanged. The formula shown by Hwang et al. [27]
on Eve’s optimal information in variations of BB84 QKD protocol in the
coherent attacks, which is regarded as the most general attacks, can also be
used to compute the information on the bases of the T [QA]. Therefore, Eve’s
information on the bases of the T [QA], i.e. the values of T [KTA], is at most
0.5v bits if she induces less than e ≤ 0.11v errors in the T [QA].
We now consider the information obtained by Eve in the qubits of the
C[QA]. Since neither the bases nor the values of the C[QA] is revealed, Eve
can only manipulate the qubits to get information. She thus gets no informa-
tion on the bases of the C[QA], i.e. the values of the C[KTA]. Hwang et al. [29]
have shown the fact if Eve attacks the qubits individually. We argue that it
is also correct even if Eve performs coherent attacks as follows. It cannot ob-
tain more information to attach probes on the qubits because no information
is revealed later. Eve can only measure the qubits to get information. Since
the bases are chosen randomly, there is no correlation between them. The
best measuring method to get the information on the bases is to measure
each qubit individually. Therefore, Eve learns no information on the bases of
the C[QA], i.e. the values of C[KTA], even if she performs coherent attacks.
Based on the above calculation, we have shown that Eve can get at most
0.5v bits of information on KTA. Since Eve learns at least v bits of informa-
tion on the KTA and the C, she obtains at least 0.5v bits of information on
the C. Recall that C = Kr. For X , the information on the C in N1 corre-
sponds to the information on the Kr in B1. Therefore, X induces less than
D = e/v ≤ 0.11 error rate on T and gets at least 0.5v bits of information on
the sifted key Kr. X thus breaks B1.
6. Conclusion
In this work, we present two protocols, N3AQKDP1 and N3AQKDP2, to
improve three-party authenticated quantum key distribution protocol 3AQKDP
proposed by Hwang et al. The N3AQKDP1 works in a noiseless environment,
which is the same as 3AQKDP. The N3AQKDP2 considers a noisy quantum
channel. The proposed protocols resolve some issues that the authors of

資訊安全會議. 此次會議由上海交通大學和杭州師範大學聯合舉辦. 我參加
此次研討會的目的有二:
1. 參加論文發表與討論, 收集研究資料,
2. 參加大會工作會議 (steeling committee meeting), 決定下次主辦單位.
此次會議一共發表學術論文 35 篇, 論文所屬的領域包含:
1. Hash Function
2. Cryptanalysis
3. Cryptographic Protocols and Applications
4. Multi-variant Cryptography

用量子來傳遞秘密訊息比用傳統的方法來傳遞秘密訊息所洩漏
的資訊少.
這個結論使得我們可以用量子資訊來設計絕對安全的秘密訊息傳送協定,
而傳統的方法卻無法這麼做. 我們在用量子資訊來設計絕對安全的秘密訊
息傳送協定這方面也已有研究成果, 正在撰寫論文當中.
我們此行還有代表我國參加大會工作會議的任務, 此會議的重要結論是
明年我們要主辦這個研討會. 身為中華民國資訊安全學會的學術與國際合
作委員會的召集人, 我會於年底之前開始籌畫 CSCIS 2012.
與會感想
此次會議中, 我們可以很明顯感覺到大陸在密碼學方面的研究比我們好
很多. 而我國在這方面的研究能量顯然不足, 可以說只剩下中央研究院資訊
科學研究所還有少數人專心在做這方面的研究, 其餘的研究團隊在密碼學
的研究都是比較零星的. 這也可以從最近 IACR (International Association
for Cryptologic Research)所舉辦的重要學術研討會中看出來. IACR所舉辦
的學術會議大都具有很高的學術評價,例如: Crypto, AsiaCrypt, EuroCrypt,
等. 以亞洲的 AsiaCrypt 為例, 近年來我們在這個會議上發表的論文是非常
少的, 每年大約只有一兩篇, 甚至連一篇都沒有. 可見我們在基礎理論的研
究的能量是不足的. 應該長期培養這類型的研究人才, 才可以收到效果.

Abstract
We study the issue of information leakage in transmission of secret
message by using quantum bits (qubits) against individual attacks.
Quantum bits have some different properties from classical bits, such
as no-cloning and measurement. We show that using qubits to trans-
mit secret messages in an insecure quantum channel has advantage in
information security. That is, the quantum scheme leaks less infor-
mation than one-time pad. We also discuss some issues on designing
scheme to transmit secret messages using qubits.

mation leakage; Message transmission.
1 Introduction
Transmission of secret message is an important task in cryptography. Assume
that the two communicating parties share a secret key. The sender, Alice,
can encrypt a secret message by the secret key and transmit the encrypted

without information on the basis of the qubit. Therefore, the communicating
parties can detect eavesdroppers with a high probability. On the contrary,
there are no ways to detect in classical cryptosystems if the attacker copies
the transmitted messages or not.
Let us consider the scenario that Alice and Bob share a binary secret
key K = k1 . . . kn and they would like to transmit a binary secret message
M = m1 . . .mn using a qubit sequence Q. The following is a simple scheme to
transmit secret message using qubits. Let X = K⊕M . Alice and Bob agree
on the generating Q = q1 . . . qn by using the K and X. Let |0〉 and |1〉 be two
orthogonal quantum states. Let |+〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉+ |1〉) and |−〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉− |1〉).
Let R = {|0〉, |1〉} and D = {|+〉, |−〉} be two mutually unbiased bases. For
i = 1, . . . , n, the ki determines the basis of qi and a different state chosen in a
basis is decided by the value of xi. Table 1 lists the states to create qi. Alice
Table 1: Creating qubit qi.
qi xi = 0 xi = 1
ki = 0 |0〉 |1〉
ki = 1 |+〉 |−〉
sends the qubit sequence Q to Bob. Bob measures the qubit qi according to
the value of ki and obtains the outcome xi, for i = 1, . . . , n. He computes
M = K ⊕X.
We investigate the information leakage about K and M in the above
simple quantum scheme. We assume that Eve performs an individual attack
to obtain the information on Q in this paper. That is Eve attacks the Q one
qubit after another. Two results of this paper are listed as follows.
1. Eve cannot obtain individual information on the secret key K.
2. Eve can obtain 0.399n bits of information on the secret key K and the
secret message M , more precisely, K ⊕M .
As compared to the classical method, i.e. one-time pad, the attacker Eve can
obtain n bits of information on K and M . Our simple quantum scheme leaks
less information on K and M .

mation leakage in the two-state QKD protocol [2] respectively. The BB84
protocol [3] is a four-state QKD protocol. Huttner and Ekert [13] analyzed
the probability of success, induced error rate, and information gain in at-
tacking the BB84 protocol using intercept-resend strategy. Fuchs et al. [8]
introduced an optimal strategy to attack QKD protocol. They attach a quan-
tum system, called a probe, to the intercepted qubit. The intercepted qubit
is sent to the receiver. And then the attack measures the probe to obtain
the maximum information and reduce the error rate after some information
about the qubit is revealed. Williamson and Vedral [16] studied two beam
splitting attack and photon-number splitting attack. Their analysis applied
the results of intercept-resend attack and optimal strategy. Gisin et al. [10]
surveyed the QKD protocols comprehensively. Many techniques to analyze
information leakage are well described.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Some fundamental tech-
niques are described in Section 2. We describe our main result in Section 3.
We discuss some issues on designing scheme to transmit secret message using
qubits and conclude this paper in Section 4.
2 Preliminaries
Quantum cryptosystems use qubits to distribute or transmit information.
The quantum no-cloning theorem shows that a qubit with an unknown state
cannot be copied. One will alter the state of a qubit with a high probability if
he does not know its original state. The communicating parties have a high
probability to find the eavesdropper by checking for changes in quantum
states. An example of this is given below.
Let |0〉 and |1〉 be two orthogonal quantum states. Let
R = {|0〉, |1〉}
be a basis, called the computational basis. Define
|+〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉+ |1〉),
|−〉 = 1√
2
(|0〉 − |1〉).

or |−〉 with probability 1
2
respectively. If Eve sends the measured qubit to
Bob, Bob measures the received qubit in the basis R and gets |0〉 or |1〉 with
probability 1
2
respectively. Finally, Alice tells Bob the qubit is |0〉. If Bob
gets |1〉 after he measured it, they discover the qubit has been changed by
someone.
Suppose Alice sends n qubits to Bob. Each qubit was randomly cho-
sen from the four states {|0〉, |1〉, |+〉, |−〉}. If Eve intercepts all the qubits,
measures them by randomly choosing R or D, and then sends the measured
qubits to Bob, on average she would induce an error with probability 1
4
for
each qubit [13, 16]. The attack is called intercept-resend attack. In an ideal
quantum channel, we can assume all disturbances come from Eve. Assume
Alice and Bob randomly check l qubits to see if there are any errors. Then
the probability for Eve to be detected is 1− (1− 1
4
)l = 1− (3
4
)l. The proba-
bility is close to 1 if the value of l is large enough. To reduce the probability
of being detected, Eve should intercept less qubits. However, this strategy
also reduces the amount of information she could acquire by eavesdropping
on the transmission.
3 Information leakage
We first describe Lemma 1 that is used to analyze information leakage in
transmission of secret messages. Theorem 2 shows the information leakage for
the simple quantum scheme. Lemma 3 shows an upper bound of information
leakage on the basis of qubit if the value of qubit is revealed. Lemma 3 can
be used to analyze the information leakage in eavesdropper detection.
Assume that Alice would like to send two traditional bits (b, v) secret to
Bob by using a qubit |q〉. Let R = {|0〉, |1〉} and D = {|+〉, |−〉} be the
possible bases of the qubit. Let |0〉 and |+〉 correspond to 0, and let |1〉 and
|−〉 correspond to 1. Alice creates |q〉 according to (b, v) and sends it to Bob.
The value of b denotes the basis of |q〉 and the value of v is the value of |q〉.
Table 3 lists the states to create |q〉.
Eve intercepts |q〉. In order to get information about |q〉, Eve has to ma-
nipulate |q〉 to learn the secret (b, v). Fuchs et al. [8] introduced a method
7
follows.
Let {M0,M1} be a set of Eve’s measurement operators.
M0 = |ϕ0〉〈ϕ0|,
M1 = |ϕ1〉〈ϕ1|.
Here the indexes 0 and 1 refer to the measurement outcomes; |ϕ0〉 and |ϕ1〉
are two states given by
|ϕ0〉 = cos θ|0〉+ sin θ|1〉,
|ϕ1〉 = sin θ|0〉 − cos θ|1〉,
where θ is a variable angle taken counterclockwise from |0〉. To identify the
four states by {M0,M1}, we divide the four states into two groups, each
outcome indicates one group, and randomly choose a state from the group.
There are three possible grouping methods.
First, let 0 indicate the group {|0〉, |+〉}, and 1 the group {|1〉, |−〉}. The
probability of distinguishing the state correctly is
Pc =
1
4
[
1
2
(〈0|M0|0〉+ 〈+|M0|+〉) + 1
2
(〈1|M1|1〉+ 〈−|M1|−〉)
]
. (1)
Substituting M0 and M1 into equation (1), we have
Pc =
1
4
(
cos2 θ +
1
2
+
1
2
sin 2θ
)
. (2)
To maximize Pc with respect to θ, it gives θ = pi/8 and P
max
c = 0.427. After
the qubit is measured by {M0,M1}, Eve knows that the qubit |q〉 is in one of
states {|0〉, |1〉, |+〉, |−〉} with probabilities {0.427, 0.073, 0.427, 0.073}. Thus,
the Shannon entropy Ha posteriori ≥ 1.601. We have
I(A;E) = Ha priori −Ha posteriori
≤ 2− 1.601 = 0.399. (3)
Here I(A;E) denotes Eve’s information gain on the secret. By the grouping
method, Eve’s information is on the value of v.
In the second grouping method, we can let 0 indicate the group {|0〉, |−〉}
and 1 the group {|1〉, |+〉}, the maximum probability of distinguishing the
9
Without loss of generality, we can assume that b = 0 and v = 0. Hence,
the qubit |q〉 sent by Alice is |0〉. Eve intercepts the qubit and measures it in
basis R and D randomly. Eve can learn the value of b if she has chosen D to
measure the qubit |0〉 and Bob measures the qubit sent by Eve to get v = 1.
When Alice and Bob publicly check the value of v to find it wrong, Eve knows
that she has chosen a wrong basis to disturb the qubit. The probability of
getting the value of b is 1
4
and Eve gets one bit of information. Therefore, on
average Eve obtains 0.25 bits of information on the value of b in an attack.
Lemma 3 shows an upper bound of Eve’s information gain on the value of
b if she performs an optimal individual attack and the value of v is revealed.
Lemma 3. Assume that |q〉 is prepared by Alice as described above. Eve
intercepts |q〉, attaches a probe to |q〉 and then sends |q〉 to Bob. If the value
of |q〉, i.e. v, is revealed, on average Eve can learns at most 0.399 bits of
information on the value of b.
Proof. Eve measures the probe to obtain information on the basis of |q〉. If
v = 0, the |q〉 should be |0〉 or |+〉; otherwise the |q〉 should be |1〉 or |−〉.
Hence, two possible states of |q〉 are remained instead of four possible states.
That is, Eve has to distinguish |q〉 between two states instead of four states
by measuring the probe of |q〉. Suppose that Alice announces v = 0. Eve has
to distinguish between |0〉 and |+〉. The maximum probability to distinguish
correctly is cos2(pi/8) ≈ 0.854. Similarly, she has to distinguish between |1〉
and |−〉 if v = 1. The maximum probability is also 0.854. Hence, Eve can
obtain at most
Ib(A;E) = 1−H(cos2(pi/8)) ≈ 0.399 (6)
bits of information on the basis of |q〉, i.e. the value of b. Here H(·) is the
binary Shannon entropy.
For the sake of completeness, we briefly describe the result of the infor-
mation leakage on the value of qubit if the basis of qubit is revealed. The
result has derived by Gisin et al. [10] in their analysis of Eve’s information
gain on the BB84 protocol. Eve can attach a probe on the intercepted qubit
11
can use the announced random numbers and the values of qubits by attach-
ing probes to the qubits to deduce some information of the secret message.
Although the information of the secret message deduced by Eve are proba-
bilistic, the secret message can be revealed by accumulating the information
in a sequence of attacks. To solve this issue, the random numbers cannot
be revealed. Therefore, we combine the secret key with the secret message
as the values of qubits. Since Eve has no information on the secret key, she
cannot break the secret message even if she has some information on the
values of qubits.
The amount of information leakage is useful in the decision of whether
the secret key has to be discarded or not. The communicating parties can
use the quantum bit error rate (QBER) to estimate the information leakage
so that they can evaluate how much information of the secret key is leaked
if the scheme aborts. Noise effect is a practical issue in quantum channels.
Noise not only makes some errors in the message received by the receiver
but also can be a mask of the attacker. We believe that the QBER and
error correction codes are useful tools to help the communicating parties
competing against eavesdroppers and noise. As we mentioned before, the
secret key has to be updated after it is used once. An efficient key evolution
method is necessary for a message transmission protocol. These issues will
be discussed in our full version paper.

在投稿國際期刊的經驗中, 我們發現必須充分明瞭本身研究的貢獻, 還必須熟悉投稿的
期刊所接受的研究範圍與目標. 對於量子密碼研究有興趣的期刊分佈於物理學, 密碼學, 
資訊科學與數學等領域, 然而不同領域的研究興趣範圍卻有所差異. 例如, 物理學的期
刊對於量子密碼研究大多著重於特定技術的發展與應用, 目前在理論上著重於糾纏態方
面的研究與應用方案, 實驗上也有相當多的論文. 而在以密碼學或數學為主的期刊中, 
安全性方面的定義與證明則是最主要的貢獻. 在以資訊安全相關的資訊科學期刊則會對
於設計一個密碼系統的整合性有興趣. 此外, 目前國際上以量子資訊與量子密碼為主要
收錄的期刊有以下三個, 
(1) Quantum Information &amp； Computation. 
(2) Quantum Information Processing. 
(3) International Journal of Quantum Information. 
他們對於以上的研究都有興趣, 而且研究的創新性與證明要求都很高. 
這三年中我們對於研究的領域已有相當的瞭解, 不過我們並沒有充分延伸我們的研究成
果. 未來我們將以這三年的研究成果為基礎, 先進行一些已發表的量子密碼系統的改進, 
增加本計畫研究成果的累積. 然後進行以公平性條件為前提的量子密碼系統設計與理論
方面的研究, 特別是安全性的證明. 以期望在量子密碼研究上, 未來能趕上先進國家的
研究水準.
