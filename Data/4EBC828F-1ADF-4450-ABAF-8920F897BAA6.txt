提出 ESORA 演算法，其細節敘述如下。 
Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) incorporates probabilistic analysis into 
optimization process so that an optimum design has a great chance of staying in the 
feasible design space when the inevitable variability in design variables/parameters is 
considered. One of the biggest drawbacks of applying RBDO to practical problem is 
its high computational cost that is often impractical to industries. In search of the most 
suitable RBDO method for industrial applications, we first evaluated several existing 
RBDO approaches in details such as the double-loop RBDO, the Sequential 
Optimization and Reliability Assessment (SORA) and the Response Surface Method 
(RSM). Then, based on industry needs, a platform incorporating/integrating the 
existing algorithm of optimization and reliability analysis is built (i.e. Efficient SORA) 
for a practical RBDO problem.  
General procedure of ESORA is three-fold. First, Mean Value based RBDO is 
performed. The mathematical formulation of Mean Value based RBDO is similar to 
that of deterministic optimization. Therefore, there is no sacrifice in computation cost. 
Further, solutions of MV based RBDO are much closer to probability constraints than 
that of deterministic optimization (which is adopted by SORA). By making the first 
optimal design trail close to the target reliability, convergence rate of the whole 
optimization iteration can be speed up and therefore, is more attractive to engineers. 
Second, the Response Surface (RS) is constructed at the optimum point by Moving 
Least Square (MLS), and based on RS, the inverse reliability analyses (PMA) is 
performed to determine the inverse Most Probable Point (MPP). Note that the inverse

thus the RBMDO problem is computationally prohibited and has become one of the 
research topics in these days. Many researchers have focused on avoiding the system 
level analysis without sacrificing the accuracy. For this, a bi-level analysis is used 
here to decompose the multidisciplinary system. As a result, RBMDO becomes 
several individual sub-system optimizations thus no system level analysis is required. 
In the bi-level optimization framework, it possesses the characteristic of distributed 
system. One of the key characteristics is the original problem is decomposed into two 
or multiple levels, while the inconsistency among subsystems at each level is 
coordinated at one level above.  
To accelerate the reliability-based optimization in each sub-system, the methodology 
of decoupling technique is utilized here. With this technology, the RBDO problem 
which is a double-loop process in nature; is converted into a series of deterministic 
optimizations and reliability analyses, and therefore, the computational cost is reduced. 
Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the proposed process. Results are 
compared to the Fully Integrated Optimization (FIO) or All-In-One (AIO) method to 
verify the accuracy of the proposed process. Efficiency is also examined by 
comparing the method of Probabilistic Analytical Target Cascading (PATC). Results 
shown here indicate the proposed method can provide an optimal design in a very 
efficient way for a multidisciplinary system that usually involves extreme high 
computation costs.

1.關於 RBDO 的部分 
Despite the interest from many industries including automobile, aerospace and heavy 
equipment industries, RBDO is not employed as a regular part of design process, 
particularly because of its impractical running time. Many research institutions and 
universities have proposed different algorithms to overcome this issue (Myers and 
Montgomery 2002; Qu and Haftka 2002; Du and Chen 2003; Youn and Choi 2004).

optimizer to each discipline and followed by multidisciplinary analyses. In other 
words, the physical feasibility is examined and satisfied at each optimization. One of 
the disadvantages of this approach is expertise from each discipline does not have 
many opportunities to make their contribution during the optimization process. 
Another drawback of FIO is the multidisciplinary analyses are inherently expensive 
and therefore is computationally prohibited at most time. Because of the complexity 
of MDO and the need for practical applications, it is not surprising if one attempts to 
maintain the autonomy in each disciplinary system. In this regard, many distributed 
formulations for MDO have been developed such as Concurrent Subspace 
Optimization (CCSO), Collaborative Optimization (CO), Distributed Analysis 
Optimization (DAO) and Analytical Target Cascading (ATC) (Keane and Nair 2005, 
Kim et al 2003). These formulations decompose the system into several subsystems, 
and therefore allow the analyses or optimizations to be conducted in each individual 
discipline to fulfill the organizational and computational considerations.   
Collaboration Optimization (CO) is a bi-level algorithm and possesses the 
characteristic of distributed system. Many researchers have been utilized CO in their 
studies (Kroo et al 1994). By introducing auxiliary design variables and compatibility 
constraints, one can remove the feedback and feed-forward in an integrated system 
and decompose the integrated system into several independent disciplines. The 
auxiliary design variables are “copies” of the computed linking variables from 
upper-level or top level. For example, if the linking variable, Yij, is copied, then the 
coupling is relaxed through Yij. The tolerance constraint, added to the optimization 
problem in the upper level, is that the original variable and auxiliary variable are 
matched at the solution. Note that the CO approach will make the number of design 
variables larger than that of the original problem. Further, since the system is divided 
into several subsystems and calculated in parallel, inconsistency will be existed 
among those sharing variables and responses at each optimization iteration unless the 
converged is reached. The measure of such inconsistency is called discrepancy 
functions. Note that the local variables are removed from the upper-level and only 
controlled by the disciplinary system (i.e., the lower-level) in CO algorithm. 
In CO formulation, the goal of upper-level is to minimize the system overall objective 
function, while the disciplinary level attempts to minimize discrepancy functions. The 
most attractive feature of CO is that it allows the disciplinary autonomy in both 
analysis and optimization. Therefore, expertise from different fields can contribute 
their knowledge to the optimization process. The CO process fulfills the industry need, 
especially, when the system is extremely complicated. However, several researches 
have also pointed out the difficulty in solving CO formulation of optimization 
problem (Keane and Nair 2005, Alexandrove and Lewis 2002). The difficulty arises

boundary. This process is repeated until the optimal point is converged. Figure 1 
illustrates the SORA flowchart where optimization and reliability analyses are 
completely decoupled, thus reducing computational cost. This process, however, 
presupposes that random field at each design trial in optimization process remains the 
same, which is not a realistic assumption in many cases. Furthermore, the first step of 
the SORA (i.e., the deterministic optimization) drives the optimization design to the 
deterministic constraint boundary. Usually, this point needs to be pulled back into a 
feasible region when variability in random design parameter is considered. 
Convergence rate of SORA from the first optimal design to the final optimal design 
may be slow and may not be viable in an industry application (Choi 2005). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Flowchart of SORA 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the flowchart of ESORA. In ESORA, MV-based RBDO is 
performed first, followed by a reliability analysis at the reliability-based optimal point. 
This step will avoid driving the first optimal design to the deterministic constraint 
boundary. The information of the MPP, gathered from reliability analysis, is again 
used to obtain a new constraint boundary. Subsequently, deterministic optimization 
and reliability analysis is performed repeatedly until the optimal point is converged. 
Note that ESORA can be very effective for a problem with a relatively low number of 
random design variables/parameters and insignificant nonlinearity, which includes a

DECOUPLING OPTIMIZATION AND RELIABILITY ANALYSIS 
In order to fully capture the concept of the decoupling technique, two major reliability 
analyses are first introduced in the following manner 
 
Reliability Analysis & Inverse Reliability Analysis 
A typical reliability analysis aims to find the failure probability of a given system 
performance, i.e., the reliability performance with a determined limit state. Such 
analysis uses the reliability index (β) as a reliability measure and is referred to as the 
Reliability Index Approach (RIA). Inverse reliability analysis, on the other hand, 
focuses on finding a specific system performance corresponding to a given reliability 
and is referred to as PMA, Du et al. (2003). In this case, the limit state is varied but  
value is determined. RIA and PMA are illustrated in Figure 3. 
 
Figure 3. MPP of reliability analysis (left) and inverse reliability analysis (right) in U space 
 
(1) is evaluated when the RIA approach is used in optimization procedure, calling for 
an evaluation of the equation, Prob{gi(x,p)≤0}, for each probabilistic constraint. In 
general, there are many probabilistic constraints in a RBDO procedure, and some of 
them may never become active. In this case, the cost of reliability analyses on such 
inactive constraints will be exceptionally high and inefficient. To alleviate this 
difficulty, Tu et al (1999) proposed the concept of inverse reliability analysis in which 
a percentile performance (inverse reliability) is formulated to replace the probabilistic 
constraint in (1). The percentile performance formulation is provided in (2): 
Minimize: f (d,x,p)= rgOBJ  
Subject to: Prob{gi(d,x,p)≤0}≥αi, i=1,2,…,m    (1) 
 
           g

In (2), g

displayed in (3):

analysis must be performed in order to obtain values of the inverse MPP. SORA or 
safety-factor based RBDO suggests that this reliability analysis can be performed at 
the end of each deterministic optimization. As for the first optimization process of 
SORA, since there is no inverse MPP available at this time, mean values of random 
design variables/parameters are suggested. 
It is important to note that inverse MPP values are calculated from PMA and 
correspond to the target reliability, while MPP values are obtained from RIA and 
correspond to the specified limit state. In other words, the computed reliability is not 
necessarily nearby the target reliability in RIA. Therefore, it would be more 
appropriate to use inverse MPP values in (4) in order to shift the constraints to the 
vicinity of the desired probability-based boundary. Therefore, ESORA adopts the 
PMA approach in RBDO process. 
 
Size of DOE 
Once the reliability target of a system is set, the value of β can be determined from the 
standard normal distribution table. β is the minimum distance from the MPP to the 
origin in U space, the standard normal space corresponding to the uncertain X space. 
This distance can be transformed back to the original random variable space (i.e., X 
space), and it can be used to estimate size of DOE (e.g., the range of each input 
parameters in DOE). Both RIA and PMA approach can utilize this concept when 
conducting DOE to build RS. However, the reliability index (β) obtained in RIA is not 
predictable and is not necessarily close to the target reliability index. Thus, the sized 
of DOE estimated above may not be able to cover the MPPs calculated in RIA. 
Extrapolation in the RS is expected in this case. PMA has no such difficulty because 
the inverse reliability analysis only focuses on the target reliability level and the 
calculated MPP should be within DOE range at most times. 
 
MEAN VALUE METHOD (MV) 
MV is one of the classical reliability analyses. Since it only uses the linear 
combination of first order polynomial terms to predict system response, it is not 
considered suitable for a highly nonlinear system. Wang (2004) revisited this method 
and quantified the error introduced by MV. The results indicate that MV-induced error 
depends on the coefficient of variation (cov) of random variables. It is not surprised 
that MV will introduce certain error in reliability analysis if a system is nonlinear. 
Nevertheless, MV-based optimization provides a good guidance for a complicated 
RBDO problem. Furthermore, the running time of MV-based optimization and 
deterministic optimization is identical if parallel computation is available. Therefore, 
MV-based optimization is used in our proposed method (i.e., ESORA) to enhance 
 14 
evaluations does not increase significantly, the computation time of AMV will be 
double that of MV since the additional numerical analysis, the (n+2)
th
 evaluation, can 
be conducted only when ZMV is available. For this reason, AMV is not used in this 
study. 
第二年: 
In order to take advantage of the distributed system in MDO, RBDO must be 
decomposed first via inverse reliability analysis, once the overall system is 
decomposed; a controlling center is formed to supervise the optimization and 
reliability analysis in parallel. Thus, a bi-level RBDO structure is built in which the 
upper-level is the controlling unit and the lower-level consists of two independent 
analyses. Details are described as follows: 
 
LINKING VARIABLES & THE STRUCTURES OF THE PROPOSED RBDO 
To apply a distributed-like system in RBDO problem, one first needs to identify the 
linking variables. There are two sets of linking variables in our proposal. The first set 
is the Design Variables (DV) and the second set is the MPP obtained from inverse 
reliability analysis as shown in Figure 5. It is seen that the proposed RBDO is a 
bi-level optimization approach. The top level is the coordinating center controlling the 
difference of responses between the upper- and lower-level analyses. The 
lower-level/bottom level has two units, namely inverse reliability analysis and 
deterministic optimization as shown in Figure 5. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Structure of the proposed RBDO. 
 
Because MPP obtained from inverse reliability can drive the optimal design to the 
boundary of probability-based constraints, inverse MPP is chosen as one of the 
linking variables as shown in the previous section. That is, once the discrepancy 
functions are converged, the corresponding reliability-based optimal design is 
obtained. Details are explained as follows: 
 
GENERAL FORMULATION OF THE PROPOSED RBDO APPROACH

RBDO). In which, ε1 and ε2 are the deviation tolerances; DV

第三年: 
In this section, the general mathematical formulation of ATC considering the 
variability in design variables is described. The formulation consists of super-system 
and subsystem corresponding to the top and bottom level of the modeling hierarchy 
(the bi-level system).   
1. Target cascading at the super-system level (top level)  
The super-system is described as follows: The objective of the top level is to 
minimize the deviations for top level response and super-system linking variables, and 
satisfy the super-system design constraints and tolerance constraints coordinating the 
subsystem responses and subsystem design linking variables. Formally,  
 
where Csuper={k1,…,kcsuper}, csuper is the number of child elements of the super-system 
level and Rsub=(Rsub,1,…,Rsub,Csup), Rsub = Rsub,1∪…∪Rsub, Csup and Rsub, i ∩ Rsub, j = 
Φ for i = j. The objective that minimizes deviations for super-system responses and 
the linking variables is modified by adding deviation tolerances εR and εy to 
coordinate values of the responses from the subsystem, Rsub, and the subsystem 
linking variables, ysub. gsup is probabilistic design constraints at the super-system level.  
 
2. Target cascading at the subsystem level (bottom level)  
The  j
th
 subsystem level problem is described in equation described below: minimize 
the deviations for subsystem responses and subsystem-level linking variables subject 
to subsystem design constraints. Formally,

Two limit state functions are considered. In Case 1, the stress at the fixed end must be 
less than the yield strength (r), and in Case 2, the tip displacement must be less than 
the allowable displacement (do = 2.25”). The target reliability is set as 99.865% (i.e., 
β = 3) for both constraints. In Case 1, the limit state function (gS) can be expressed as

Three RBDO approaches: double-loop, SORA and ESORA, are used to perform 
optimization, and they are illustrated in Figure 8. The figure shows that double-loop 
method performs comprehensive reliability analyses at each design trial. SORA 
decouples reliability analysis and optimization, and each analysis is executed 
separately and sequentially. In ESORA, a small number of reliability analyses based 
on MV are performed at each design trial during the first optimization process, and as 
a result, the design from the first optimization process almost satisfies the reliability 
target. Note that the number of simulations for reliability analyses depends on the 
number of random variables. The optimization algorithms used here are Multi-Island 
Genetic Algorithm and Sequential Quadratic Programming (i.e., NLPQL) for all three 
approaches. Except MV used in ESORA, Monte-Carlo simulation is chosen to 
perform reliability analyses and the number of sampling points is set as 1E5 for all 
three approaches. Note that RS is not used anywhere in Example 1.

Note that results shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 indicate that the ESORA and SORA does 
not converge exactly to the same optimum design as shown in the double loop 
approach. The reasons are due to each approach is converged to different reliability 
and the optimization result/procedure is sensitive to the reliability level. For example, 
the reliability of the double-loop, the SORA and the ESORA is 99.865%, 99.864% 
and 99.875%, respectively. A minor difference in reliability results in an obviously 
different optimized beam size. If the data is examined in details, one can find that the 
optimal points between the double-loop and the SORA are closer compared to the 
optimal points between the SORA and the ESORA. The reason for this is because the 
converged reliability of the former is closer to the later (0.001% verse 0.011%). 
Another observation is the comparison between the last two iterations of the SORA 
and the final result of the double-loop. Both reliability and the optimal beam size of 
the final optimal point of the double-loop are between the results of last two iterations

(3) Ten-bar truss problem  
The third example is a ten-bar truss problem which is adopted from the study of 
Haftka and Gurdal (1992). The example is illustrated in Figure 12 and the structure is 
under two loads, P1 and P2. The design objective is to minimize the weight, W, by 
varying the cross-sectional areas, Ai, of the truss members. The design constraints are 
the stresses of each member should be smaller than allowable stress (e.g., yielding 
stress). Design information is summarized in Table10.

(4) Polynomial problem 
Geometric programming problems with polynomials are known to have a unique 
globally optimal solution. This problem is used here to illustrate the key ideas of 
applications of the target cascading formulation in reliability-based optimization. The 
example provided by Kim et al. has a quadratic objective function, 12 deterministic 
design variables, 2 random design variables, 4 equality and 6 inequality constraints, 
and nonnegativity constraints for all design variables, as shown in the following 
equation. 
 
 
The design variable of x8 and x11 are random design variables. The initial mean values 
of these two variables are assumed to be 5 and the standard deviations are assumed to 
be 0.01. Since these two random variables are related to every constraint shown above 
and therefore, every constraint must be considered as probabilistic constraint and the 
target reliability is set as 90%.  
To apply ATC into this example, the original problem is reformulated as a bi-level 
super-system and subsystem as shown in the earlier section. After solving the 
super-system, Psuper, the subsystems Psub1 and Psub2 are solved based on the targets x3 
Rsuper
, x6
Rsuper6
 and x11

 found in the Ps problem. Note that these three targets are
