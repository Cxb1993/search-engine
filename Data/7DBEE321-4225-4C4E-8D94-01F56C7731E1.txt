Information from AFM is RMS (root mean square) roughness which is a principle 
information to compare surface roughness. For example, as shown in Fig 3.0-2, bulk 
surface and N-GaN surface have RMS roughness 0.263nm and 0.518nm respectively. 
So we know that N-GaN surface is rougher than bulk surface.

Chapter 3 Background  
The InGaN/GaN MQWs were used widely on the optical devices, such as blue, 
green LEDs, and UV laser. The band diagram of InGaN/GaN MQWs was shown in 
Fig 3-1 without the polarization effect.

In order to realize the structure of GaN, we should understand the index for four 
axis. It is Miller-Bravais Notation. In the description of the five plane lattices, we 
chose to describe the diamond primitive lattice in terms of a centered rectangular 
(non-primitive) lattice. We adopt this convention because the centered rectangle 
illustrates the rotational symmetry of the lattice more clearly than the diamond lattice. 
Of course, the downside is that we must be careful in accounting for the two lattice 
points per cell when we try to describe a pattern or crystal with a centered rectangular 
lattice. For the same reason, a variation on Miller indices, the Miller-Bravais notation, 
is often used for hexagonal crystals and rhombohedral (a.k.a. trigonal) crystals as well. 
This 4-index notation (h k i l) possesses the apparent symmetry of the hexagonal 
lattice in the basal plane (the plane perpendicular to the six-fold rotation axes). In 
other words, M-B notation ascribes similar indices to similar planes. In the Fig. 3-2, 
the primitive 120°-rhombus cell in the basal plane of a hexagonal lattice is shaded. 
This basal plane of the lattice is fully described by the two basis vectors a1 and a2. Of 
course, a3 is a crystallographically equivalent basis vector, it is simply redundant.

The captions are placed in the octahedral sites of this basic array and form second set 
of closed-packed planes which are inserted between the oxygen layers. To maintain 
charge (valence) balance, however, only two thirds of octahedral sites available are 
filled with captions. Figure 4 demonstrates the (0001) oxygen closed-packed planes of 
sapphire (large circles), and projections of aluminum atoms located in the planes just 
above and below this plane (small circles). The (0001) plane of AlN is drawn in Fig. 
3-5, aluminum and nitrogen atoms belonging to the same plane are indicated by small 
and large circles, respectively. The positions of aluminum and nitrogen atoms lying in 
the plane of AlN are shown in Fig. 3-6. The atomic arrangement of sapphire oxygen 
plane is presented in Fig. 3-7. Here oxygen atoms are shown by large circles and 
aluminum atoms which in this case are located just below and just above the plane of 
projection—by small circles.

Chapter 4 Research approach  
4-1  Buffer Layer Growth Condition to Morphology 
In this section, we determine the surface morphology and crystal quality of GaN 
epitaxial layer based on different thickness of the high growth temperature 
Aluminum-Nitride (HT-AlN) epitaxial buffer layer. We have three samples which 
have different buffer growth time from each other, and sample “R095”, “R094”, 
“R086” have growth time 70sec, 80sec and 90sec respectively. As shown in table4.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 4-1 the growth time of buffer layers.  
We will judge the crystal quality and surface morphology of epitaxial layer from 
atomic force microscopy (AFM), optical microscopy (OM) and from X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) in crystal and pits direction that is decided by Miller -Bravais index.     
As shown in Fig 4.1, the (a), (b), (c) images are sample “R095”, “R094”, “R086” 
respectively. All these images are in the scale of 5um×5um, and the color contrast of 
color bar represent the scale limitation of height. We can see these figures, and get 
some information for surface morphology.

are measured by AFM.

R086 )1010( 2mμ×  24.144 nm 13.557 nm 785 
 
  We sketch curves of growth time versus roughness RMS as Fig. 4-3, XRD FWHM 
in pits and crystal direction as Fig. 4-4, growth time versus pits number as Fig. 4-5, 
and growth time versus pits depth as Fig. 4-6.  
According to AFM image above in scale of 255 mμ× (Fig3.1.1-1) and 21010 mμ×  
(Fig3.1.1-1), we can not choose one as the best smooth surface, so we study the 
roughness RMS curve in Fig3.1.1-3. As shown in following Fig3.1.1-3, we can see 
the curve of roughness RMS in the scale of  255 mμ×  and 21010 mμ× . and both of 
the two curves show that we can get the lowest RMS in 70sec of buffer growth time. 
As everyone knows that the lower roughness RMS in AFM represents the smoother 
surface, so we can choose “R95”as the best surface morphology.

R086 234.812 1240.8 0.940 nm 1.290 nm

Owing to the two segments, we find a critical point in the FWHM curve in 
crystal direction. As shown in Fig 4-6, we comparing the curve of pits depth in Fig. 
4-6 with the curve of FWHM in crystal direction in Fig. 4-4, and we discover that the 
trend in both two curves are similar, so we can realize the relationship between crystal 
quality and pits depth is very closely. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 4-6 curve of growth time versus pits depth.  
 In above all characteristic of “R095”, “R094”, and “R086”, we can suppose that 
we can get find morphology when the buffer is thinner because the FWHM in crystal 
and pits direction both decrease as the growth time decreasing. 
 
4-2  Un-doping Layer Growth Condition to Morphology 
 
  In this section, we determine the surface morphology and crystal quality of 
epitaxial GaN layer base on different thickness of the first un-dope GaN epitaxial 
layer. We have three samples which have different u1 growth time from each other, 
and the growth time of “R086” is 600 second, the other two are plus 50sec and 100sec 
growth time. As shown in table 3.2.1-1

Fig. 5-2 The crystal direction occur during A-plane GaN growing.  
  As shown in Fig 5-3, there are OM and AFM images of pits. In OM image, we 
can see triangle pits, and a tail follows every pits. In AFM image, we can find that the 
tail following pits is a massif of crystal, because the fastest growth rate of (0001) 
direction, and other direction can not follow the growth rate of (0001) direction. Then 
the pits will form.

  In C-plane GaN, the growth rate does not have significant difference in the 
directions which are perpendicular to (0001) axis. GaN growth in C-plane surface 
have equal growth rate, so the step flow represent divergent curve as rippling on the 
water. We also evidence the direction of wafer cut in R-plane 32OAl−α , as showing 
in Fig5-8.

3. u2-GaN V/III ratio :  
  As shown in Fig4.2-3, around the red circle we can discover that FWHM in crystal 
direction is almost in saturation point. It is meaning that the crystal quality is stable, 
and it does not change as the V/III ratio changing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 5-11 Curve of u1 V/III ratio versus FWHM in pits direction and crystal direction  
   In addition to the FWHM in crystal direction, the FWHM in pits direction 
decreases abidingly. It is meaning that the pits density decreases as the V/III ratio 
increasing. But around the blue circle, although the FWHM in pits direction decrease, 
the FWHM in crystal direction increase more greatly. So we should operate u2-GaN 
in high V/III ratio.
