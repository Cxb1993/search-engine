ICHAPTER ONE
ABSTRACT (1)
To improve the transfection efficiency of polycations with DNA, we synthesized
poly(ester-co-urethane)(PEU-g-PEI800) with short chain PEI800 in the side chain, and
poly(ester-co-urethane)(PEU) without short chain PEI800. Both PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU, readily
self-assembled with plasmid DNA ( pCMV- β gal) in a HEPES buffer, were characterized by
dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential. The results reveal that PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU were
able to self-assemble particles with DNA and yield nano-sized complexes (＜200nm) with positive
charge at N/P ratios of 20/1 and 120/1, respectively. The degradation studies indicate that the
half-life of PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU in the HEPES buffer were 14 and 35 hours at pH 7.4,
respectively. Titration studies were performed to determine the buffering capacities of the polymers.
The COS-7 cell viabilities in the presence of PEU-g-PEI800/DNA, PEU/DNA, and PEI25k/DNA
were studied. In addition, The PEU-g-PEI800/DNA complexes were able to transfect COS-7 cells in
vitro with a high efficiency comparable to a well-known gene carrier PEI25k. The results indicate
that PEU-g-PEI800 is an attractive cationic poly (ester-co-urethane) for gene delivery and an
interesting candidate for further study.

CHAPTER TWO
ABSTRACT (2)
To improve the cytotoxicity of PEI25k and the transfection efficiency of poly(β-amino ester) with
DNA, we synthesized a poly(β-amino ester), PEDP, bearing ester linkages in the backbone and
tertiary amines in the backbone and side chain and prepared a binary mixture, PEDP-PEI25k, using
physical blending meyhod. Both poly(β-amino ester) PEDP and binary mixture PEDP-PEI25k,
readily self-assembled with plasmid DNA ( pCMV- β gal) in a HEPES buffer, were characterized
by dynamic light scattering. The results reveal that PEDP-PEI25k was able to self-assemble
plasmid DNA into PEDP-PEI25k/DNA nano-complexes small enough to enter a cell through
endocytosis. Titration studies were performed to determine the buffering capacities of PEDP and
PEDP-PEI25k. The COS-7 cell viabilities in the presence of PEDP and PEDP-PEI25k were studied.
At low mass ratio of PEDP/PEI25k (1/1), it is found that the transfection curve of
PEDP-PEI25k/DNA bearing a maximum peak is similar to that of PEI25k/DNA. In addition, the
PEDP-PEI25k/DNA complexes were able to transfect COS-7 cells in vitro with a high efficiency
comparable to a well-known gene carrier PEI25k/DNA. The results indicate that binary mixture
PEDP-PEI25k is an attractive cationic carrier for gene delivery and an interesting candidate for
further study.

ABSTRACT (3)
In this study, PLGA nanoparticles were modified with PEI by an emulsion-diffusion
evaporation technique using PVA as a stabilizer. The size of modified particles was characterized by
atomic force microscopy (AFM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Also Zeta potential and gel
electrophoresis studies were performed to understand the surface properties of cationic nanoparticles
and their ability to bind negatively-charged DNA. The cytotoxicity of the cationic nanoparticle/DNA
complexes was detected by MTT assay. The DNA delivering of PLGA/PEI nanoparticles was
evaluated by measuring pEGFP and pCMV-βgalexpressions with fluorescence and ONPG assay,
respectively. Results showed that an increase in the PLGA content would lead to an increase in
particle size but lower the cytotoxicity. Moreover, the transfection efficiency of PLGA/PEI
nanoparticles is even much better than PEI alone since the incorporation of PLGA helps to reduce to
complexes’cytotoxicity but not compromise the PEI’s transfection potential.

CHAPTER FOUR
ABSTRACT (4)
New glycidyl-based (epoxide-based) poly(aminoester) (EPAE) containing hydroxyl and amino
groups in the backbone and side chain was synthesized. EPAE self-assembled readily with the
plasmid DNA(pCMV-βgal) in HEPES bufer and was characterized by dynamic light scatering, zeta 
potential, fluorescence images, and XTT cell viability assays. To evaluate the effect of molecular
weight of EPAE system on transfection, EPAE polymers with three different molecular weights
(EPAE22k, EPAE18k, and EPAE8k) were also prepared. This study found that all EPAE polymers
were able to bind plasmid DNA and yielded positively charged complexes with a nano-sized
particles (＜200 nm). The EPAE22k/DNA and EPAE18k/DNA complexes were able to transfect
COS-7 cell in vitro with higher transfection efficiency than other EPAE8k/DNA. These results
demonstrated that molecular weight of EPAE system had a significant effect on transferring ability.
Examination of the cytotoxicity of PEI25k and EPAEs system revealed that EPAEs system had lower
cytotoxicity. In this article, EPAEs seemed to be a novel cationic poly(aminoester) for gene delivery
and an interesting candidate for further study.

31. Introduction
Gene therapy requires a gene delivery system that is efficient and has no or low cytotoxic side
effects. In polymer-based gene delivery systems, the complexes of condensed DNA with
polycations have many advantages [1-3]. Cationic polymers not only condense DNA into
nano-particle small enough to enter cell, but also protect negatively charged strands of DNA nuclease
degradation. Additionally, cationic polymers would provide a PH-buffering capacity allowing them
to behave as a proton sponge which would assist in the escape of complexes from lysosome and
improve the transfection efficiency [4, 5]. However, some amino-containing polymers, such as
poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PDMAEMA), poly(amido-amine)(PAA), and
poly(ethylenimine)(PEI), demonstrate a considerable degree of cytotoxicity [6-9]. Consequently,
there have been great efforts to synthesize biodegradable polycations that can be used as gene
carriers. A number of reported biodegradable gene carriers including poly(4-hydroxy-L-proline ester)
[10,11], poly(β-amino ester) [12-15], polyphosphoester [16], and polyurethane [17,18], have been
synthesized. Polyesters are well-know biodegradable biomaterials used in wide range of applications,
including the controlled release of DNA-based therapeutic agents. Polyurethanes, because of their
biodegradability and functionality in terms of chemical and physical properties, have been
investigated for different biomedical applications [19,20]. Polyester and polyurethanes are
considered to be a biocompatible, biodegradable, and low-toxicity material with high cationic
potential. However, these materials have a significant limitation, namely, low transfection efficiency.
One of the primary causes of poor gene delivery is the inefficient release of vectors from endosomes
into the cytoplasm. On the other hand, high-molecular-weight poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) has been
revealed to be the most effective non-viral vector based on cationic polymers owing to its high pH
buffering capacity that is believed to enhance the exit of vectors from the endosomes compartment
[21]. However, sometimes the high toxicity of high-molecular-weight PEI limits its application in
gene therapy. In this study, amine-containing poly (ester-co-urethane) (PEU-g-PEI800) bearing short
chain PEI800 in the side chain has been designed and synthesized and their structure in correlating to
5in THF.
2.3. Synthesis of EOD
EOD was synthesized as shown in the first step of Scheme 1. 1.4-Diaminobutane and gilcidyl
methacrylate with a molar ratio of 2/1 (-NH2/epoxy) were mixed in anhydrous dichloromethane in a
three-necked reaction flask under a dry nitrogen purge and then cooled to 18C to react for 24 hours.
The product was purified through column chromatography using elute solvent (acetone/ethyl acetate).
The structure of EOD was characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR.

2.4.Synthesis of PEOH
The monomers of EOD and 6-amino-1-hexanol with a–C=C/-NH2 molar ratio of 1/1 were mixed
in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a three-necked reaction flask under a dry
nitrogen purge and then heated to 85C to react for 8 hours. The product was precipitated in
anhydrous ethyl ether and vacuum-dried at 40C. The structure of PEOH was characterized by
FT-IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR.

2.7.Acid-base titration assay of polymers
Acid-base titration was used to evaluate the buffering capacity of synthesized cationic polymers.
In this assay, 10 mg of PEU-g-PEI800 was dissolved in 10 mL of 150 mM NaCl. 100 L of 1N
NaOH was then added to the solution to adjust the PH to 11.6 before it was titrated with acid.
The solution was titrated with increasing volumes of 0.1 N HCl solutions, and the results were
measured using a pH meter. The pH range of PEU was determined using the same procedure.
2.8.Hydrolytic degradation of polymers
PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU were dissolved in a buffer solution (pH 7.4) with a concentration of
10mg/mL, and then incubated in a water bath at 37C for various durations. After hydrolysis for
various durations, the solution was dried in a vacuum for several hours to remove water. The
molecular weight of the polymer was determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
2.9.XTT assay
The influence of the polymer concentration on the cell viability was evaluated in a cell culture for
9PEU-g-PEI800/DNA complexes and PEU/DNA complexes with various N/P ratios were
prepared.
2.13.Transfection protocol and ONPG assay
COS-7 cells were used to evaluate the transfection efficiency of polymer/DNA complexes. The
cells were seed in a 96-well plate (1.0×104 cells per well) in complete DMEM and incubated for
24 h before transfection trials. The DNA concentration was kept constant at 5μg/mL(1.0μg/well)
and the amounts of polymers were varied. 200 μL solutions of polymer/DNA complexes was
taken and incubated with cells for 1 h at 37℃. The medium was replaced afterwards with
complete DMEM and the cells were incubated for another 48 h. For evaluating transfection
efficiency, the cells were washed with 0.3 mL PBS and then permeabilized with 20μL cell lysis
buffer at 4℃ for 20 min. An ONPG solution (180 μg/well) was added after lysis treatment and
the cells were incubated at 37℃ for 1h. The expression of pCMV-βgalgene was measured
spectrometrically using an ELISA reader at a wavelength of 405 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural characterizations of PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU
PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU were synthesized as shown in Schemes 1. The chemical structures of
polymers were confirmed by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. Figure 1 shows the FT-IR spectra of the
synthesized PEU and PEU-g-PEI800. The peaks at 1732 cm-1 (C＝O, stretching, urethane), 1638
cm-1 (C＝O, stretching, amide), 1560 cm-1 (N-H, bending, amide), and 3351 cm-1 (N-H, stretching,
urethane) represent the absorptions of urethane and amide groups in PEU, as shown at the top of
Figure 1. The peaks at 1721 cm-1 (C＝O, stretching, urethane), 1626 cm-1(C＝O, stretching, amide),
1516 cm-1(N-H, bending, amide), and 3368 cm-1(N-H, stretching, urethane) represent the absorptions
induced from PEU-g-PEI800, as shown at the bottom of Figure 1. The chemical shifts of
characterized protons and carbons of PEU and PEU-g-PEI800 are shown in the materials and
methods section. The reaction between OH group in PEU and NCO group in ethyl isocyanatoacetate
was monitored by the disappearance of the characteristic peak of–CH(OH)- (4.06ppm) in PEOH and
11
cell membrane, resulting in an enhanced uptake.
3.3. Buffering capacity of polymers
Titration studies were performed to determine the buffering capacities of the various polymers
regarding a proton buffering effect within the endosomal / lysosomal compartments of the cell
(Figure 4). All of the polycation solutions had a pH of 11.5 to 11.8 after the addition of 1.0 N NaOH.
The non-viral vector PEI showed a buffering capacity over a wide pH range, which is probably due
to the high amount of amine functions present in the polymeric chain. The incorporation of low
molecule weight PEI800 content changed the buffering region of the polycation. The data show the
pH range of PEU-g-PEI800 to be between 11.8 and 5.5 and that of PEU to be between 11.8 and 6.4.
It was found that the polymers with short chain PEI800 content have a high buffering capacity.
3.4. Cytotoxicity of polymers/DNA
A critical element for the gene delivery system is cytotoxicity. Cell damage resulting from a
cytotoxic delivery system is deleterious because cells must be capable of supporting translation and
transcription. To determine the cytotoxicity of PEU-g-PEI800/DNA and PEU /DNA for comparison
with that of PEI25k/DNA, we performed a XTT assay using the COS-7 cell line. Cells were
incubated with increasing amounts of PEU-g-PEI800/DNA, PEU/DNA and PEI25k/DNA. Relative
cell viabilities of PEU-g-PEI800/DNA, PEU/DNA, and PEI25k/DNA were shown in Figure 5. As
can be seen, the cell viability of PEI25k/DNA complexes decreased rapidly with an increase in
PEI25k concentration, whereas that of PEU-g-PEI800/DNA and PEU/DNA did not change much
with an increase in PEU-g-PEI800 and PEU, respectively. The results show that
PEU-g-PEI800/DNA and PEU/DNA exhibited substantially lower toxicity on COS-7 cells than did
high molecule weight PEI25k/DNA. We infer that PEU-g-PEI800/DNA and PEU/DNA can provide
better cytotoxicity profiles than these presently used for PEI25k/DNA due to the differences in the
chemical structure, which reduces the high charge density of the polycation.
3.5. DNA gel retardation assay
The electrophoretic mobility behavior of free DNA, PEU-g-PEI800/DNA, and PEU/DNA is shown
13
complex. These results demonstrated that the introduction of short chain PEI800 into the side chain
of poly(ester-co-urethane) has a significant effect on the size distribution and transfection ability of
relative complex.
3.8. AFM (atomic force microscopy) images of PEU/DNA and PEU-g-PEI800 /DNA
nano-particles
Figure 10 (a and b) shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of PEU/DNA and
PEU-g-PEI800/DNA complexes at a N/P ratio of 100/1 and 20/1, respectively. At a N/P ratio of
PEU/DNA (100/1) and PEU-g-PEI800 (20/1), nearly all complexes condensed to a roughly spherical
shape with a average particle size of 189 and 148 nm, respectively. The discretely spherical images
verify the very efficient DNA condensation obtained using PEU and PEU-g-PEI800. The AFM
images of complexes were captured after the complexes were coated on mica and dried with
compressed air. The observed dimensions, therefore, are slightly different from the ones determined
in aqueous media using DLS.
4. Conclusion
Poly(ester-co-urethane)(PEU-g-PEI800) bearing short chain PEI800 with low cytotoxicity, high
biodegradability, and high transfection efficiency was synthesized and then characterized using
FT-IR, NMR, and GPC in this study. PEU-g-PEI800 and DNA had a strong electrostatic interaction
to self-assemble nano-particles. The positive charges in the backbone and side chain of
PEU-g-PEI800 condense DNA to form DNA-polycation complexes. The transfection efficiency of
PEU-g-PEI800 into COS-7 cells was better than that of the PEU without short chain PEI800, which
resulted in numerous amine groups of PEU-g-PEI800 with short chain PEI800 in the side chain.
Biodegradable PEU-g-PEI800 could potentially be used in a non-viral gene delivery system.

ABSTRACT
To improve the cytotoxicity of PEI25k and the transfection efficiency of poly(β-amino ester) with
DNA, we synthesized a poly(β-amino ester), PEDP, bearing ester linkages in the backbone and
tertiary amines in the backbone and side chain and prepared a binary mixture, PEDP-PEI25k, using
physical blending meyhod. Both poly(β-amino ester) PEDP and binary mixture PEDP-PEI25k,
readily self-assembled with plasmid DNA ( pCMV- β gal) in a HEPES buffer, were characterized
by dynamic light scattering. The results reveal that PEDP-PEI25k was able to self-assemble
plasmid DNA into PEDP-PEI25k/DNA nano-complexes small enough to enter a cell through
endocytosis. Titration studies were performed to determine the buffering capacities of PEDP and
PEDP-PEI25k. The COS-7 cell viabilities in the presence of PEDP and PEDP-PEI25k were studied.
At low mass ratio of PEDP/PEI25k (1/1), it is found that the transfection curve of
PEDP-PEI25k/DNA bearing a maximum peak is similar to that of PEI25k/DNA. In addition, the
PEDP-PEI25k/DNA complexes were able to transfect COS-7 cells in vitro with a high efficiency
comparable to a well-known gene carrier PEI25k/DNA. The results indicate that binary mixture
PEDP-PEI25k is an attractive cationic carrier for gene delivery and an interesting candidate for
further study.

characteristics of polymer/DNA complexes. In this study, PEDP and PEDP-PEI25k were designed
and their structures in correlating to DNA condensation capacity, buffering capacity, cytotoxicities,
and transfection efficiency are discussed. However, it is found that PEDP has some significant
limitations, namely, condensation ability with DNA and poor buffering capacity. One of the chief
causes of poor gene delivery is the inefficient release of complexes from endosomes into the
cytoplasm. Poly (ethylenimine) (PEI) has been revealed to be the most effective non-viral carrier
because of its high pH buffering capacity that is believed to enhance the escape of the complexes
from the endosomal compartment. The binary mixture of PEDP and PEI25k prepared using physical
method was used as the DNA carrier and studied on cellular delivery of plasmid DNA in this article.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
1,4-Butandiol diacrylate was obtained from Merck, Germany. Butyl amine and
3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine were obtained from Fluka, Switzerland.
1-(3-Aminopropyl)imidazole and Polyethylenimine (Branched PEI，Mw=2500) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. The solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Tedia co., USA) was dried
over calcium hydride and distilled just before use. N-[2-hydroxyethyl]
piperazine-N’-[2-ethanesulfonic acid] (HEPES) were obtained from Sigma Co. (USA).
N-methyldibenzopyrazine methyl sulfate (electron-coupling reagent) and sodium
(2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) (XTT) were purchased
from Roche Co. (USA). The plasmid pCMV-LacZ (pCMV-βgal)contained a CMV promoter to drive
the β-galactosidase (LacZ) gene expression. The plasmid DNA was amplified in Escherichia coli
(DH5αstrain) and purified using column chromatography (Qiagen® Plasmid Mega kit, Germany).

polystyrene as the reference. The weight- and number-average molecular weights (Mw and Mn,
respectively) were calibrated with standard polystyrene samples. The sample concentration in the
THF was 2.5 mg/mL, and the flow rate was 1.0 mL/min.
Buffering Capacity of Polymers
Acid-base titration was used to evaluate the buffering capacity of PEI25k, PEDP, and PEDP-PEI25k .
In this assay, 10 mg of polymer was dissolved in 10 mL of 150 mM NaCl, and then 100μL of 1 N
NaOH was added to the solution to adjust the pH to the alkaline range at 11.6. HCl (0.1 N) was used
as the titratant to lower the pH to acidic conditions at around 2.0-2.5. Titration increment size =
100μL.
Hydrolytic degradation of polymers
PEDP was dissolved in a buffer solution (pH 7.4) with a concentration of 10mg/mL, and then
incubated in a water bath at 37C for various durations. After hydrolysis for various durations, the
solution was dried in a vacuum for several hours to remove water. The molecular weight of the
polymer was determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
Preparation and Characterization of Polymer/DNA Complexes
5.0 mg/mL of the polymer was dissolved in 20 mM HEPES buffer solution (pH 7.4), and its serial
dilutions were made. The polymer serial dilutions were rapidly added into the DNA solutions to
obtain polymer/DNA complexes. Then, the complexes were allowed to self-assemble in the HEPES
buffer solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before measuring. The hydrodynamic
sizes of the polymer/DNA complexes were determined by dynamic light scatter (Nicomp 380 system,
35
washed with 0.3 mL PBS and then permeabilized with 20μL cell lysis buffer at 4℃ for 20 min. An
ONPG solution (180 μg/well) was added after lysis treatment and the cells were incubated at 37℃
for 1h. The expression of pCMV-βgalgene was measured spectrometrically using an ELISA reader
at a wavelength of 405 nm.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Structural Characterizations of Synthesized Poly(β-amino ester)s
Poly(β-amino ester) (PEDP) was successfully synthesized through the reaction of 1,4-butandiol
diacrylate with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine as scheme 1. Fig. 1 showed the FT-IR spectra of
the reactants and products. The disappearance of peaks at 1650 cm-1(C=C stretching, alkene) and
3320 cm-1 (NH stretching, amine) were found to represent the success of Michael addition reaction.
The chemical shifts of the characterized protons and carbons are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and listed in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. These shifts are based on the assigned labels of protons and carbons in
the chemical structures of the PEDP as indicated. The FT-IR, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR
characterizations of the synthesized polymers provided clear evidence that the PEDP was
successfully synthesized. In addition, the GPC data of PEDP show that the weight-averaged
molecular weight was 20500 with polydispersity index of 1.85.
Buffering Capacity of Polymers
Titration studies were performed to determine the buffering capacities of the various polymers
regarding a proton buffering effect within the endosomal / lysosomal compartments of the cell (Fig.
4). All of the polycation solutions had a pH of 11.5 to 11.8 after the addition of 1.0 N NaOH. The
non-viral vector PEI25k showed a buffering capacity over a wide pH range, which is probably due to
37
The electrophoretic mobility behavior of free DNA, PEDP-PEI25k/DNA, and PEDP/DNA is shown
in Fig. 8. Increasing amounts of PEDP-PEI25k and PEDP led to the neutralization of DNA negative
charges, as shown by gel retardation. The DNA mobility on agarose gel was influenced by the
presence of PEDP-PEI25k and PEDP. Fig. 8 (a)-(f) shows the PEDP/DNA and PEDP-PEI25k can all
condense DNA into complexes. Plasmid DNA was totally retained by PEDP at a mass ratio of 7/1 as
shown in Fig. 8(a). At the low mass ratio of 1/1 of PEDP-PEI25k/DNA, plasmid DNA was totally
retained as shown in Fig. 8(b)-(f).
Cytotoxicity of polymer/DNA
A critical element for the gene delivery system is cytotoxicity. Cell damage resulting from a
cytotoxic delivery system is deleterious because cells must be capable of supporting translation and
transcription. To determine the cytotoxicity of PEDP-PEI25k/DNA and PEDP/DNA for comparison
with that of PEI25k/DNA, we performed a XTT assay using the COS-7 cell line. Cells were
incubated with increasing amounts of PEDP-PEI25k/DNA, PEU/DNA and PEI25k/DNA. Relative
cell viabilities of PEDP-PEI25k/DNA, PEDP/DNA, and PEI25k/DNA were shown in Fig. 9. As can
be seen, the cell viability of PEI25k/DNA complexes decreased rapidly with an increase in PEI25k
concentration, whereas that of PEDP-PEI25k/DNA and PEDP/DNA did not change much with an
increase in PEDP-PEI25k and PEDP, respectively. The results show that PEDP-PEI25k/DNA and
PEDP/DNA exhibited substantially lower toxicity on COS-7 cells than did high molecule weight
PEI25k/DNA. We infer that PEDP-PEI25k/DNA can provide better cytotoxicity profiles than these
presently used for PEI25k/DNA due to the addition of Poly(β-amino ester)(PEDP), which reduces
the high charge density of the polycation.
Cellular delivery of plasmid DNA viaPEDP and PEDP-PEI25k vectors
The transfection efficiency is expressed by the amount of β-galactosidase (equivalent to ONPG
absorbance) measured in COS-7. The effect of weight ratios of PEDP/DNA, PEDP-PEI25k/DNA,

1. Introduction
The carriers used for gene delivery are generally classified as viral [1] and non-viral vectors [2].
Viral-DNA complexes give high levels of transgene expression, however, immunogenicity, limit size
of inserted DNA and toxicity [3,4] can limit their application. Non-viral vectors offer a promising
alternative since these viral hazards are minimized. Cationic lipids [5,6] and cationic polymers were
two major classes of non-viral systems for gene delivery. Cationic polymers, such as poly
(ethylenimine) (PEI) [7,8], chitosan [9,10], poly-L-lysine (PLL)[11] and polyurethane [12-14], are
usually studied on gene delivery. These polycations possess less toxicity but their transfection
efficiency is also relatively low.
The PEI can be synthesized in branched or linear form with different lengths [15,16] which
primary amines are involved in the interaction with negatively-charged DNA, while its secondary
and tertiary amines are responsible for the endosomal disruption after endocytosis [17] due to their
photo-sponge effect [18]. It has been found that the more positive charges cause stronger
electrostatic force to form small complexes and better gene transfection efficiency. However, high
amount of positive charges would also result in certain cytotoxicity [19,20].
Nanoparticles with loaded DNA or drugs are often concerned on the solubility of mutual
materials and their stability [21,22]. Also, such as low encapsulation efficiency, incapability to
escape lysosomes and DNA degradation are the fundamental limitations by a double emulsion
method in preparation of DNA nanoparticles [23,24]. Therefore, making cationic materials
adsorbed/linked onto nanoparticles’surface and to form the complexation of DNA and cationic
nanoparticles can be a new approach. This method has advantages of improving loading efficiency,
increasing bioavailability and remaining the DNA activity because bioactive molecules are not
involved in the presence of organic solvents during the preparation process [25,26] . In this study, we
have formulated the new nanoparticles by using a FDA approved biodegradable and biocompatible
polymer, poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)[27] and the polymer’s surface was modified with
PEI by an emulsion-diffusion-evaporation technique using PVA as a stabilizer. Physicochemical
57
were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS
(Malvern, UK). For PCS measurements, all samples were diluted 100 fold in deionized water.
Measurements were carried out with a laser of 4mW He-Ne 633nm at angle of 173o and dispersant
RI of 1.33 and viscosity of 0.8872 cp were used for the calculation of hydrodynamic diameters. The
surface charge of cationic nanoparticles and cationic nanoparticles-DNA complexes were determined
by zeta potential on a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, UK). All samples were diluted 50 fold
in deionized water and the measured electrophoretic mobility () was applied for the calculation of
zeta potential (z) by Henry equation (= 2z f(ka) / 3whereis dielectric constant andis
viscosity). The value for Henry’s function f(ka) is taken as 1.5.
2.6. Gel electrophoresis of PLGA/PEI-DNA complexes
The electrophoretic mobility of cationic nanoparticle/DNA complexes was also measured in
0.8% (w/v) agarose gel with Tris-Borate- EDTA (TBE). The experiment was conducted at 100 volts
for 35 min and then the gel was immersed in a0.5μg/mL ethidium bromide solution for 30min,
DNA bands were visualized by UV irradiation and photographed.
2.7. Atomic force microscopy and SEM
The size and surface morphology of the cationic nanoparticles and cationic nanoparticle/DNA
complexes were analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and SEM. For AFM, instrument
(NanoScope E, Digital Instruments Inc.) was set in contact mode using a n+/ n - Silicon (resistivity
0.01-0.02 Ohm-cm) cantilever with a spring constant of 0.07-0.4 N/m and a resonance frequency of
10-17 kHz. Scanning was performed at a scan speed of 1.0 Hz with a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels.
For SEM, a drop of samples was placed on carbon strip mounted on an aluminum stage. After
air-drying, samples were shadowed with gold-palladium at 15 mA for 100 seconds to minimize
surface charging. Observation on surface morphology was conducted with a Hitachi S-3000N
scanning electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.
2.8. Cytotoxicity evaluation by MTT assay
Cytotoxicity of the PLGA/PEI-DNA complexes was determined by
59
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is commonly used to stabilize an emulsion since it helps to form
relatively small particles and to narrow down the size distribution. Firstly, to study the influence of
PVA concentration on the size of PLGA nanoparticles, the PLGA concentration was fixed at 1mg/mL
and various PVA (from 0.5 to 2 mg/ml) was taken to form nanoparticles by
emulsion-diffusion-evaporation technique. Fig. 1 shows particle size has greatly reduced with PVA
concentration from 0.5 to 0.6 mg/ml. An increase in PVA concentration (to 2 mg/ml) had an optimum
on stabilizing particle size.
3.1.2. Effect of PLGA concentration
In this study, fixed PVA and PEI concentration at 2 mg/ml and 0.2 mg/ml, respectively was used
and PLGA concentration was varied in organic phase to form cationic nanoparticles. It is found
that increase PLGA concentration would result in larger particle sizes (from 210 nm to 270 nm)
with or without DNA (see table 2). The ratio of PVA to PLGA stands an important parameter in
forming of nanoparticles. In table 1, when PVA/PLGA ratio was smaller than 0.5, thin film of
PVA-PLGA was obtained. A higher ratio (PVA/PLGA>0.6) were able to bring production of
nanoparticles. These indicates that the presence of PVA is essential of stabilizing emulsion forming
and also the ratio of PVA to PLGA has an critical impact on dispersive morphology of
nanoparticles.
3.2. Zeta potential
The zeta potential value is an important characteristic because it influences the stability of
charged particles as well as the ability to interact with negatively-charged cell membrane for
transfection. It has been reported that the zeta potential of PLGA nanoparticles in neutral buffer is
around -45 mV [28] resulting from the presence of uncapped end carboxyl groups of PLGA on the
particle surface. However, table 1 and table 2 show that the decreased PLGA concentration
(formula A>B>C>D) leads to a decrease in zeta potential of PLGA/PEI particles from +18.3 mV to
+7.5 mV. This result is attributed to molecules of PEI attached to PLGA surface either via
hydrophobic interaction between the–C-C- backbones or via electrostatic bounding between two
61
due to parts of PEI positive charges compromised by the presence of PLGA. The cytotoxicity in vitro
of cationic nanoparticles complexated with DNA was evaluated in COS-7 cells. The effect of
Formulas (A, B, C, D) and N/P ratios of PEI to DNA was shown in Fig 4. Clearly, the PLGA/PEI
formulations were found to reduce to toxicity than PEI alone at 24h after transfection (Fig. 4B).
Moreover, Fig. 4A and 4B show that complexes made at higher N/P ratios bear higher cytotoxicity
due to extensive positive charges. Besides the N/P ratios and formulations, toxicity upon cells is
related to the period in culture medium once cells were incubated with PLGA/PEI DNA complexes
for 1 hour transfection. The complexes made at lower N/P ratios could hold on lower toxicity till 24
hours and so higher transfection efficiency and more products of gene expression are expected (see
section of 3.6 and 3.7)
3.6. Expression of EGFP
The in vitro transfection ability of PLGA/PEI DNA nanoparticles from Formula A, B, C and D
were evaluated in COS-7 and HeLa cell lines using EGFP as a report gene. At 4 hr and 24 hr after
cell transfection (t = 0), EGFP positive cells were seen under a fluorescence microscope. At 4 hrs
after transfection (t = 4 h), the complexes made at N/P ratios of 154/1, 230/1 with Formula A
resulted in the greatest number of EGFP-transfected cells even better than PEI alone (which optimal
N/P ratio was 77, figure 5A). At 24 hrs after transfection (t = 24 h), the optimal N/P ratio of
PLGA/PEI DNA complexes shifted to lower values around 38/1. Still, the PLGA/PEI nanoparticles
showed a better potential in transfection efficiency than PEI alone (Fig. 5B and 5C) in COS-7 and
HeLa cells.
3.7. Expression of beta-galactosidase
The in vitro transfection ability of cationic nanoparticle of formula A, B, C and D with DNA
complexes were evaluated in COS-7 and HeLa cell line using pCMV-βgal as a report gene. At 4
and 24 h after transfection, expression of beta-galactosidase was quantified enzyme assay, indication
transfection. The cationic nanoparticles formulations have a higher transfection effect than PEI 25k
alone for N/P ratio of 77/1 to 308/1 at 4h after transfection (Fig. 6A) and N/P ratio of 19/1 to 77/1 at

Abstract
79
Nonviral gene delivery systems based on complexes of condensed DNA with polycations have
attracted great attention in recent years. The polycations/DNA complexes not only can protect DNA
from nuclease degradation but also have a nanoscale size small enough to enter the cell through
endocytosis (Reineke et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2008). Amine-containing polycations such as poly
L-lysine (PLL) (Asayama et al., 1997)), poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethylmethacrylate (PDMAEMA)
(Van de watering et al., 1997) , and polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Boussif et al., 1995), polyamidoamine
(Zhang et al., 2005) have been proposed as carrier for genetic materials because they readily form
complexes with DNA. However, these polycations are nonbiodegradable materials associated with a
considerable degree of cytotoxicity. These drawbacks prohibit their use in some gene delivery
systems where a toxicity-free carrier is required. Consequently, have been great efforts to synthesize
biodegradable polymers that can be used as gene and drug carriers. The most important factors
affecting the biodegradability of polymer materials included the chemical structure, physical and
physico-mechanical properties (Acemoglu, 2004). Polymer degradation is classified as surface
erosion (seen in polyanhydrides) or bulk erosion (displayed by polyesters, where it is controlled by
the hydrophobic character of the polymer backbone). In surface erosion, the biodegradation proceeds
exclusively at the surface of polymer. Degradation proceeds throughout the polymer matrix and
immediate drop of molecular weight is observed in the case of bulk erosion. Polyanhydrides and
polyesters are well-known biodegradable biomaterials used in wide range of applications, including
the controlled release of therapeutic agents (Park et al., 1996; Luten et al., 2008). A number of
reported biodegradable gene carriers include poly(4-hydroxy-L-proline ester) (Putnam et al., 1999),
poly(α-(4-aminobutyl)-L-glycolic acid) (Lim et al., 2000), crosslinked poly(aminoester) (Lim et al.,
2002), linear poly(β-aminoester)s (Guo et al., 2009; Akinc et al., 2003; Lynn et al., 2001),
polyphosphoester (Wang et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2003), polyurethanes (Liu et al., 2009; Jian et al.,
2009), and polyethylenimine derivatives (Ahn et al., 2002; Petersen et al., 2002). Typically, these
biodegradable polycations contain both chargeable amino groups, to allow for ionic interaction with
the negatively charged DNA phosphate, and a degradable region, such as hydrolyzed ester, amide,
81
reagent) and sodium (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide)
(XTT) were purchased from Roche Co. (USA).
2.2 Polymer characterizations
The structures of the polymers were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Bruker
AMX-400 spectrometer) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR, Mattson Galaxy Series 5000
spectroscope). The molecular weight and distribution of the polymer was determined by gel
permeation chromatography analysis (GPC, Waters Model LC-2410) based on polystyrene standards
in THF.
2.3 Synthesis of EOD
EOD was synthesized as shown in the first step of Scheme 1. 1.4-Diaminobutane and gilcidyl
methacrylate with a molar ratio of 2/1 (-NH2/epoxy) were mixed in anhydrous dichloromethane in a
three-necked reaction flask under a dry nitrogen purge and then cooled to 18C to react for 24 hours.
The product was purified through column chromatography using elute solvent (acetone/ethyl acetate).
The structure of EOD was characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR.

-NHCH2CH2CH2CH2NH-), 2.15(6H, -C(CH3)=CH2), 2.60(4H, -NHCH2CH2CH2CH2NH-), 2.80(4H,
-NHCH2CH(OH)-), 4.06(2H, -NHCH2CH(OH)-), 4.59(2H, -CH2OCO-), 5.66(2H, -C(CH3)=CHaHb),
6.07(2H, -C(CH3)=CHaHb). 13C NMR(400MHz, d6-DMSO, ppm) δ: 18.53 (-COO-CCH3=CH2),
30.71 (-CH2CH2NH-), 49.12 (-CH2CH2NH-), 49.23 (-NH-CH2CHOH-), 57.54 (-CH2-CHOH-CH2-),
59.71 (-CHOH-CH2-COO-), 125.58 (-CCH3=CH2), 136.15(-CCH3=CH2), 175.15 (-COO-)
2.4 Synthesis of EPAE
The monomers of EOD and 6-amino-1-hexanol with a–C=C/-NH2 molar ratio of 1/1 were mixed in
anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in a three-necked reaction flask under a dry nitrogen
purge and then heated to 85C to react for 8 hours. The product was precipitated in anhydrous ethyl
ether and vacuum-dried at 40C. The structure of EPAE was characterized by FT-IR, 1H-NMR, and
13C-NMR.
83
COS-7(HeLa) cells were cultured in complete DMEM and then seeded at a density of 1.0×104
cells/well. The cells were incubated at 37C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 24 hours.
Subsequently, the cels were incubated for one hour in 200 μL FBS-free DMEM containing polymer
with various concentrations. The cells were incubated in DMEM as a negative control. After 1 hour,
the cells were washed with 200 L PBS solution and replaced by complete DMEM for a further 48
hours of incubation. Then, 50L of XTT labeling mixture was added to each well and the cells were
further incubated at 37C for 1 hour. Results are expressed as the relative cell viability (%) with
respect to control wells containing culture medium.
2.8 Formation of polymer/DNA complexes
The plasmid pCMV-LacZ (pCMV-βgal)contained a CMV promoter to drive the β-galactosidase
(LacZ) gene expression [Lim et al., 1989; Crystal et al., 1995]. The plasmid DNA was amplified in
Escherichia coli (DH5α strain) and purified using column chromatography (Qiagen® Plasmid Mega
kit, Germany). The purified plasmid DNA was dissolved in a tris(hydroxymethyl)
methylamine-ethyldiaminetetraacetic acid (Tris-EDTA) buffer (pH 8.0) and determined using the
ratio of UV absorbance at 260nm/280nm. Monkey SV40 transformed kidney fibroblast COS-7 cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL-1651). The cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, GibcoBRL Co., Ltd.) supplemented with 10% 
FBS, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, and 4 mM L-glutamine, and maintained at 37 C
in a humidified 5% CO2-containing atmosphere. Then, 10.0 mg/mL of the polymer was dissolved in
20mM HEPES buffer (pH7.4) and its serial dilutions were made with the various N/P ratios of
polymers/DNA. The complexes were then allowed to self-assemble in the HEPES buffer. They
incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes before measurements.
2.9 Characterizations of polymer/DNA complexes
The particle sizes and surface charges of the polymer/DNA complexes were determined by dynamic
light scattering (Nicomp 380 system, USA) and electrophoretic mobility at 25C with a
Zeta-potential system (Nicomp Instrument, USA).
85
THF.
3.2 Size and Zeta-Potential analysis of polymer/DNA complexes
Figures 2 and 3 show the size and Zeta-potential of EPAEs/DNA complexes at various mass ratios,
determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic mobility at 25C with
Zeta-Potential analysis. The size of complexes decreased with increase of the mass content of the
polymers until the N/P ratio of EPAE18k/DNA and EPAE22k/DNA reached 70/1 and that of
EPAE8k/DNA reached 160/1. The results show that the average diameters (＜200 nm at N/P 70/1) of
EPAE18k/DNA and EPAE22k/DNA and the average diameter (＜200 nm at N/P ratio 160/1) of
EPAE8k/DNA fall within the optimal range (40nm-200nm) required for cellular endocytosis. The
above data demonstrates that EPAE22k and EPAE18k with higher molecular weight condense DNA
better than EPAE8k with low molecular weight. The Zeta-potential of the resulting complex changed
from negative charge to positive charge when the amounts of EPAEs increased. When the N/P ratio
of EPAE22k/DNA and EPAE18k/DNA complexes was higher than 2/1, the surface of pCMV-β-gal
was fully occupied with the EPAE molecules, forming positive charge complexes. When the N/P
ratio of EPAE8k/DNA complexes was higher than 15/1, positive Zeta-potentials of the complexes
formed. Complexes with extra positive charges on their surfaces had better interaction with the target
cell membrane, resulting in an enhanced uptake.
3.3 Buffering capacity of polymers
Titration studies were performed to determine the buffering capacities of the various polymers
regarding a proton buffering effect within the endosomal / lysosomal compartments of the cell
(Figure 4). All of the polycation solutions had a pH of 11.5 to 11.8 after the addition of 1.0 N NaOH.
The non-viral vector PEI showed a buffering capacity over a wide pH range, which is probably due
to the high amount of amine functions present in the polymeric chain. Molecule weight of EPAE can
change the buffering region of the polycation. The data show the pH range of EPAE22k to be
between 11.8 and 5.7 and that of EPAE8k to be between 11.8 and 6.6. It was found that the polymers
with higher molecular weight have a high buffering capacity.
87
values of 7.4 in order to approximate the environments within endosmal vesicles. The EPAE22k and
EPAE18k generally degraded faster than that of EPAE8k at pH 7.4. The degradation studies indicate
that the half-life of EPAE22k, EPAE18k, and EPAE8k in the HEPES buffer were 36, 33, and 18
hours at pH 7.4, respectively. These results show that EPAE8k exhibited higher hydrolytic
degradation rate than did EPAE22k and EPAE18k at pH7.4.
3.7 Cellular delivery of plasmid DNA via EPAE vectors
The transfection efficiency is studied by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 10) and the amount of
β-galactosidase (equivalent to ONPG absorbance) measured in COS-7. The effect of N/P ratios of
EPAEs/DNA and PEI25k/DNA complexes on transfection in COS-7 cells are shown in Figure 11. As
can be seen, EPAE22k and EPAE18k with higher molecular weight had the greater transfection
efficiency than EPAE with low molecular weight. The transfection efficiencies of EPAE22k/DNA
and EPAE18k/DNA complexes increased with an increase in N/P ratios, whereas that of
PEI25k/DNA complexes did not observe. The best relative transfection efficiency of EPAE22k/DNA
and EPAE18k/DNA complexes were reached at N/P ratio 110/1, which was higher than that of
PEI25k/DNA and EPAE8k/DNA complexes. This discrepancy may be due to the difference in proton
sponage effect and size distribution of relative complex. These results demonstrated that molecular
weight and introduction of hydroxyl group into the backbone and side chain of poly(aminoester)
have a significant effect on the size distribution and transfection ability of relative complex.
4. Conclusion
Poly(aminoester)s (EPAE22k and EPAE18k) bearing amino and hydroxyl groups with low
cytotoxicity, high biodegradability, and high transfection efficiency were synthesized and then
characterized using FT-IR, NMR, and GPC in this study. EPAE22k (EPAE18k) and DNA had a
strong electrostatic interaction to self-assemble nano-particles. The positive charges in the backbone
and side chain of EPAE22k (EPAE18k) condense DNA to form DNA-polycation complexes. The
transfection efficiency of EPAE22k and EPAE18k into COS-7 cells was better than that of the
EPAE8k, which resulted in numerous amine groups of EPAE22k (EPAE18k) in the backbone.
