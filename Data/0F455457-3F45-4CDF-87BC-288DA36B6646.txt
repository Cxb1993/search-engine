Abstract 
Most polymers are non-conductive. In order to improve their conductivities, some fillers are 
added. However, it might reduce the mechanical strength. To increase the application, mechanical 
behaviors of thermally conductive polymers have to be improved. This can be conducted with the 
optimization of process parameters. 
This project includes preparation of thermally conductive polymers, mold design and 
fabrication, measurement of microstructure replication performance, study of parametric effects, 
the weldline analysis. 
 
Keywords: thermally conductive polymer, mechanical property, injection molding, hot 
embossing, weld line 
 
一、前言 
    有一些公司開始應用導熱高分子來做商業生產，例如 Cool Polymers 公司開始用導熱高
分子製造一些散熱器，可以用來加工出一些鋁或其他金屬，甚至陶瓷材料，均因技術或經
濟因素無法製造的電子元件。 
    高分子若要廣泛使用，必需先提高其加工性和機械性質，但大部分的研究都在討論此
類高分子的導熱和導電性質，鮮少有人去探討此類材料的加工性和機械性質。因此本研究

2.4 射出成形強度測試 
2.4.1 田口品質實驗 
經由田口方法的實驗規劃，可以減少實驗中不確定參數的調整，避免直接影響到時間
和成本的浪費，且應用田口品質實驗方法可以知道哪些製程參數的影響較大，並且找出最
佳的微射出製程參數組合。其步驟如下： 
(1) 選擇可控因子與水準 
首先，先選擇可能會影響拉伸試片抗拉強度的控制因子(Control factor)，本實驗選擇的
控制因子為模具溫度、融膠溫度、射出速度、保壓壓力、保壓時間和冷卻時間(如表 2、3
所示)。再配合水準(Level)的分配，由於考量到塑膠材料的特性與機台的參數設定範圍，並
且要在所有試片都能夠完整充填之下設定其水準的範圍值。而實驗目標是希望有縫合線的
試片，能夠在抗拉強度方面越大越好，不要因為縫合線造成的缺陷和添加填充材，導致結
構強度變弱，所以本研究選用望大型(Larger the better)的目標函數。 
(2) 選用適合的直交表 
因為實驗所選擇的控制因子有六個，而水準數有三個，所以本研究選用L18(21×37)的直
交表。第一行是2水準行，也就是行內只能配置兩個水準。而實驗所選定的六個可控因子都
是三水準數，為避免資訊的不足影響到實驗結果，所以第一行將不配置任何因子，剩下的
七行3水準中，將第八行設為空行。而在建構直交表之前，要先觀察和計算自由度(Degree of 
Freedom)，然後決定最適合的直交表，做為實驗所用。各因子的自由度是因子的水準數減1，
總自由度則是全部的實驗數減1，誤差的自由度為總自由度減每個因子的自由度之和。 
(3)最佳化參數組合 
最佳參數組合也就是各因子中，每個水準之平均η的最大值，亦可以利用因子回應圖，
清楚得知各因子中最大的η值。 
 
2.4.2拉伸試驗 
拉伸試驗機的設定為使用 5mm/min 的定速率，以一定的速度進行拉伸，直到試片斷裂
為止，且每一個試片皆為：夾距 15mm，標距 10mm。為了使實驗更具準確性，將在每一種
條件下，做五次拉伸試驗並將差異最大的值捨去後，取剩下三組數據求出其平均值。由於
實驗的試片尺寸小且薄，因此在做夾持時要非常的注意，須避免試片斷掉、拉到、夾持時
未夾緊或試片夾歪等因素，都有可能會影響到拉伸試驗的準確性。 
 
2.5 熱壓成形性測試 
2.5.1實際模仁粗糙度 
    根據田口法找出了粗糙度最佳與最差的兩組參數，並用這兩組參數按設計去線切割模
仁，所割出的模仁如圖5、圖6，再使用表面粗度儀HOMMEL TESTER T500量測，最差參
數(B3 C1 D1 E1 F3)所割出的模仁量測所得粗糙度為2.2μm、2.0μm、2.3μm、2.2μm、2.1μm，
平均:2.16μm；最佳參數(B1 C3 D2 E3 F2)所割出的模仁量測所得粗糙度為1.4μm、1.5μm、
1.4μm、1.5μm、1.5μm，平均:1.46μm。 
 
2.5.2熱壓成形高度 
    根據之前田口法所得兩組參數(最佳和最差)，用來線切割兩塊模仁去熱壓，熱壓參數採
用，如表 3，使用第 1 組參數成型高度比第 2 組來的差，第 3 組壓力太大，導致快穿透塑
料，所以也不佳，所以採用第 2 組參數熱壓(材料溫度 140℃、熱壓力量 15KN、熱壓時間
180S、脫模溫度 80℃)，熱壓結果，B3 C1 D1 E1 F3 (粗糙度最大的模仁)熱壓成型高
度:1.934mm，如圖 7，B1 C3 D2 E3 F2 (粗糙度最小的模仁)熱壓成型高度:2.228mm，如圖 8。

四、結論與自評 
本研究利用純PP和含填充材 20%及 30%三種材料，進行微結構成型實驗，再藉由田口
L18直交表進行實驗，並探討射出對成型性的影響，經過ANOVA分析後可得到以下的結論
與重要成果：  
(1)無縫合線的 No.1 試片由田口實驗可得： 
a、不含填充材的 PP 塑料成型重要因子為：保壓壓力＞保壓時間＞冷卻時間＞射出速度
＞模具溫度＞融膠溫度。 
b、含填充材 20%的成型重要因子為：融膠溫度＞模具溫度＞射出速度＞保壓壓力＞保壓
時間＞冷卻時間。 
c、含填充材 30%的成型重要因子為：模具溫度＞保壓時間＞冷卻時間＞射出速度＞保壓
壓力＞融膠溫度。 
(2)無縫合線的 No.3 試片經由田口實驗結果可得知： 
a、純 PP 塑料成型重要因子為：融膠溫度＞保壓壓力＞模具溫度＞冷卻時間＞射出速度
＞保壓時間。 
b、含填充材 20%的成型重要因子為：模具溫度＞保壓壓力＞融膠溫度＞射出速度＞保壓
時間＞冷卻時間。 
c、含填充材 30%的成型重要因子為：模具溫度＞射出速度＞保壓壓力＞冷卻時間＞保壓
時間＞融膠溫度。 
(3)對 No.1 和 No.3 無縫合線的試片而言，添加 20%和 30%的填充材的確可以有效的增加試
片之抗拉強度，尤其是對 No.1 無縫合線試片的效果最為顯著。 
 
    在熱壓實驗部分，得到的結論包括： 
(1)表面粗糙的模仁熱壓成型高度較低，表面較光滑的模仁熱壓成型高度較高。 
(2)熱壓的參數控制也極為重要，溫度不可超過塑料玻璃轉化溫度太多，熱壓力量的大小也
是個重點。 
(3)熱壓出的微結構形狀整體而言，不管是側看或橫看都是由兩邊往中成型越高，像圓弧型，
看其單一溝槽的成行也是由兩邊往中間成型越高，像圓弧型。 
參與本計畫的研究生經由此研究過程，培養出規劃實驗、分析實驗結果與解決問題之
能力，對於目前正在撰寫畢業論文上有相當大之助益。

Control-volume ﬁnite-element method (CVFEM) has been
widely used in LCM simulation (Wu et al., 1998). This research
applied this numerical approach to simulate the I/CLCM pro-
cesses. Numerical simulation was veriﬁed with experimental
results. An analytical solution was derived to calculate the
required injection pressure and ﬁlling time. A three-point
bending test was also conducted.
2. Experimental
The experimental setup includes a mold, an injection unit, a
compression unit, and a pressure/temperature measurement
system. Themoldwasmade of S45C steel and consists of three
plates. The middle plate was used as a spacer and it can be
used to adjust the preform thickness.
The mold was slightly opened to reduce the required
pressure for the resin injection. If the mold opening gap is
small, the ﬁber mats still occupy the entire cavity because

Abstract 
 
In recent years, plastics have begun to show great commercial potential especially in manufacturing micro-structured 
parts. Injection molding and hot embossing are two major microfabrication methods. Replication accuracy was 
investigated for these two methods. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was used as the polymer substrate. The 
mold insert (or master) was fabricated by LIGA-type method. In this study, hot embossing was found to have 
better replication accuracy for microstructure than injection molding. Experiments were also conducted to stud
y the effects of process parameters on the replication quality.

1. Introduction 
Many polymer-based microfabrication techniques 
have been explored for high-volume production. Par-
ticularly in the field of bio- and chemical-MEMS, 
products with microstructure are in great demand [1-
2]. In recent years, plastics have begun to show great 
commercial potential especially in manufacturing 
micro-structured parts. Injection molding is the most 
important process to manufacture plastic parts. While 
many prototype plastic micro devices are fabricated 
using precision engineering methods, such as laser 
machining, micro injection molding is currently being 
investigated all over the world [3-4]. An important 
advantage of injection molding is that with it we can 
make complex geometries in one production step in 
an automated process. Many micro devices, such as 
watches and camera components, automotive crash, 
acceleration, distance sensors, read/write heads of 
hard discs, CD drives, medical sensors, pumps, 
surgical instruments and telecommunications compo-
nents, have been successfully injection molded. 
The injection molding process involves the 
injection of a melt polymer into a mold where the 
melt cools and solidifies to form a plastic part. It is 
generally a three phase process including filling, 
packing and cooling phases. After the cavity becomes 
stable, the product is ejected from the mold. 
Hot embossing is another method of replicating 
polymer microstructures. A polymer substrate is 
heated above its glass transition temperature. A mold 
with a master is then pressed against the substrate, 
allowing the pattern to be fully transferred onto the 
substrate. After a certain time of holding and cooling, 
the substrate is cooled below transition temperature. 
The pressed substrate is removed from the mold. 
To have better replication accuracy, the common 
problem of knowing and accurately controlling the 
state of the material during hot embossing must be 
solved. When the material characteristics are well 
known, the embossing conditions can be correctly

this study. The photoresist mold acted as a pattern to 
electroplate the nickel mold. A thin gold layer was 
sputtered to create a conductive area for nickel 
growth. 
Electroplating was conducted at 50  with a pH of ℃
4, and at a low current density of 4 A/dm2 in order to 
minimize internal stress in the nickel mold. After 
electroplating, the photoresist was stripped with an 
ultrasonic shaker. The nickel structure was placed in 
acetone and then rinsed with DI water. 
 
2.4 Experimental setup 
Injection molding operations were conducted with 
an injection molding machine (FANUC ROBOSHOT 
S-2000i50A). The machine can offer a clamping force 
up to 50 tons. The screw diameter is 22 mm and the 
maximum injection volume is 29 cm3. A hot embo-
ssing machine (Fig. 2) was designed, assembled and 
calibrated. This machine mainly consists of a force 
frame which delivers the embossing force via a 
ballscrew connected with a servo motor. The force 
frame includes upper mold plate (movable) and lower 
mold plate (fixed). A mold (Fig. 1), consisting of two 
mold halves, was installed between two mold plates. 
The movable half was fixed on the upper mold plate 
and the fixed half was fixed on the lower mold plate. 
Two cartridge heaters were installed on the fixed half 
which has a cavity at the center. The movable half has 
cooling channels inside to keep it at a specified mold 
temperature. A load cell was applied to monitor the 
pressing force. The measured force was also used to 
control the embossing at a specified pressing force. A 
thermocouple was installed directly on the PMMA 
substrate to get feedback on embossing temperature 
control.

2.5 Molding parameters 
In this study, the molding parameters can be 
divided into two parts, one is for hot embossing and 
the other is for injection molding. All process para-
meters were based on material manufacture's sugge-
stions. The parameters were shown in Table 1.

3.1 Comparison with hot embossed parts and injec-
tion molded parts 
When the substrate is directly placed between the 
two mold halves, the embossed part shows incom-
plete microstructure (Fig. 3a). To have a better 
embossing quality, a rubber pad was inserted between 
the upper mold half (movable one) and the substrate. 
The embossed part showed a better replication quality 
as shown in Fig. 3b.

insert, (b) embossed part and (c) injection molded part. 
 
This phenomenon can be explained by sudden 
freezing while polymer contacts the cold groove wall. 
When the polymer flows into the groove, the skin 
layer quickly cools down. The frozen layer slows 
down and induces a smooth shape of microstructure. 
As for hot embossing, the polymer is strongly pushed 
into the groove by the embossing force. This action 
creates a better replication of microstructure. 
 
3.3 Parameters analysis 
Embossing temperature, embossing force, em-
bossing time and demolding temperature are inves-
tigated to study their effects on replication quality of a 
hot embossed part. The dimensions of rectangular 
groove row on insert were described in Fig. 9. The 
basic set of parameters for embossing temperature,

Fig. 11. Results of single factor analysis by changing (a) 
embossing temperature, (b) embossing force, (c) embossing 
time and (d) demolding temperature. 
 
embossing force, embossing time and demolding 
temperature are 160℃, 10kN, 240 seconds and 70℃, 
respectively. In this study, parametric analysis is 
carried out by changing one factor at a time keeping 
the others constant as shown in Table 3. The depth of 
groove row on insert is 81.40 µm. The replication 
heights are shown in Fig. 11. 
The results show that embossing force has little 
influence on the replication quality in this study. It 
can be explained that embossing force of 10 kN is 
enough for these experiments. Higher embossing 
force does not have better replication. An appropriate 
embossing temperature gives a best replication. 
Optimization is necessary for setting a best em-
bossing temperature. However, the polymer can be 
further pushed into the micro-groove by increasing 
embossing time. Higher demolding temperature 
induces more shrinkage after ejecting embossed part. 
Therefore, the replication height decreases with 
demolding temperature.
