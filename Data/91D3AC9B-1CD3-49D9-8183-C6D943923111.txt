There are four approaches for resistance measurements in fields: two-terminal direct current method, 
two-terminal alternating current method, three-terminal direct current method, and four-terminal probe 
method [4]. Among those, four-terminal probe method has shown to be of less measuring inaccuracy by 
offering the electric current through the two outmost electrodes and measuring the voltage responses from the 
two inner electrodes [5]. In recent years, researchers have applied this method for resistance measurements of 
cementitious materials by either wiring copper probes along the objects’ surfaces [1,6], or embedding metal 
plates into the objects’ interiors [7].  
In this paper, we have adopted the four-terminal probe method by embedding round copper sticks as 
terminals into cement binder specimens, as shown in Figure 1. The purposes of using this probing approach 
are to provide the specimens a more homogeneous electric field for electrical measurement while causing no 
significant deterioration to the structural integrity. Therefore, this approach can then quickly deploy into fields 
for practices.

2.2 Finite Boundary Resistivity 
A commonly used approach for computing electrical resistivity of a finite boundary object is Smits 
equation [8]. However, this equation is applicable for surface-contact electrodes with a semi-infinite 
conducting field, which is not the case of this study.  Therefore, we have modified Smits equation to obtain a 
finite boundary resistivity (FBR) equation for the embedded probe method. The modification is based on the 
following assumptions: 
1. current moves along the latitude of probe array, as shown in Figure 1(c) and (d) 
2. current density is evenly distributed along the probe longitude 
3. the interior electric field of each probe is neglected 
4. potential between the inner electrodes depends on the resistivity of the conducting medium

As for the metal probes, round copper sticks of 1mm in diameter were used. The electrodes are installed 
with S1 = 20mm, S2 = 80mm, and d = 40mm for the rectangular specimens; S1 = 5mm, S2 = 30mm, and d = 
50mm for the cubes. In this study, all the probes were installed upon the casting work of cement mixtures; 
however, it is expected that post-instrumentation of the electrodes can rapidly be applied to existing concrete 
structures. Samples of the completed testing specimens are shown in Figure 2. Keithley 2611 System 
SourceMeter was employed for both current supply and voltage measurements. Porous structures of the binder 
specimens were also observed using optical microscope (OM).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 Static Test – DC Resistivity 
Rectangular specimens were used for static DC resistivity test. Electrical measurements were carried at 
various curing age (1, 7, 14, 21, 28 days) with direct current of 10mA as the input. As expected in Figure 3, 
resistivity grew with age due to hydration effects of the binders, such as reduction of ionic concentration, 
vaporization of water, formation of porous structures, etc. After 1 day of curing, resistivities of the four 
binders stand close still, but grew individually with different rates after 7 days. Among those, group 2 and 3 
shows relatively larger resistivity values than plain cement binders. The 28-day resistivity of group 3 has 
reached 107.45kOhm-cm, which is 3.3 times the value of group 1 (32.52kOhm-cm). Similarly, the 28-day 
resistivity of group 2 is about 2.1 times the value of group 1. These consequences were attributed to the 
replacement of cement by fly ash and slag, which would reduce the concentration of hydroxyl ions (OH
–
) of 
the binders and thus, shrink the size of pore distribution [9-10]. The OM images taken at 28 days of curing

3.2 Static Test – Dielectric Effects 
Since cement-based materials are known to be dielectric, ionic polarization would occur more or less 
when exposed to an electric field. Similar to DC resistivity, this inherent nature has also been proposed for 
self-sensing applications of cement-based materials [11]. In this test, resistivities of each specimen were 
recorded both before and after saturation of polarization. DC current of 10mA was supplied to each specimen 
for 3600 seconds in order to ensure a complete saturation of polarization was reached. The initial and 
polarized resistivities for both rectangular and cubic specimens at 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of curing age were 
presented in Figure 5. 
For plain cement binders, polarization has resulted in a similar amount of resistivity shift (1-3kOhm-cm) 
through the curing age. This phenomenon may suggest that under the specified curing condition (room 
temperature in sealed bags); hydration process is regularly affecting the ionic concentration as well as free 
water of cement binders. Similarly, the steady shift of resistivity can also be observed in group 2 specimens 
(5-7kOhm-cm) except for the first day, where the applied electric excitation has resulted in much larger shift 
of resistivity. Fly ash replaced certain amount of cement, restrained the hydration of C3A and C3S at very early 
age, and resulted in vast amounts of free water [12]. The excessive free water is thus responsible for the 
significant polarization. 
A steady shift of resistivity can also be observed for group 3 binders before 14 days (4-8kOhm-cm). After 
that, the effect appears to be nullified as applied electric excitation caused no polarization effect. The reason 
remains unclear while the high growth rate of initial resistivity indicate that the ionic concentration of 
slag-cement binders is lower than fly ash-cement binders after 21 days of curing age. For group 4 binders, an 
increasing resistivity shift with respect to curing age was observed. The addition of conductive graphite 
particles did reduce and stabilize the electrical resistivity. Our results have suggested that the hydration of 
cement was not affected by graphite powder while the supplemented dispersant caused large porous structures 
trapping most ions at late curing age. As a result, these trapped ions then reacted to the constantly applied 
electric excitation (DC current), leading to a slight increasing of polarization effect after 14 days.

4. CONCLUSION 
Based on our investigations on electrical resistivity measurement of cement-based binders using 
embedded four-terminal probe method, the following conclusion can be made: 
1. Replacement of cement by certain amount of fly ash and slag would significantly increase the 
binder resistivity. On the other hand, inclusion of conductive graphite particles would slightly reduce the 
binder resistivity. 
2. Polarization effect of cement binders can be nullified by slag at the late age (28 days); while be 
amplified by fly ash at the early age (1 day). Graphite powder does not directly affect the polarization of 
cement binders. 
3. The duration of polarization saturation reduced with the curing age; while also varied with 
material composition and specimen geometry. Fly ash and slag caused no significant effects on 
saturation time of cement binders.

of the concrete structures is significantly scattered.  Furthermore, unlike surface-contacted electrode with 
which probes are installed on objects’ surfaces or perimeters [9,10], embedded electrode method would 
provide cement-based materials a more homogeneous electric field for electrical measurement.  It causes no 
significant perturbation to the structural integrity, but does require more sophisticated preparing work.  In this 
paper, we have compared various types of electrode instrumentations for electrical measurement of 
cement-based materials.  Surface-contacted electrode with two-point probe (SC2P), two-surround probe 
(SC2R), two-plane probe (SC2L), and four-point probe (SC4P) as well as embedded electrode with two-point 
probe (EB2P), and embedded electrode with four-point probe (EB4P) methods are orderly studied.  The 
physical phases of cement-based materials being investigated include bulk resistivity with respect to material 
composition and curing age. 
 
2. Experiments 
 
2.1 Specimen geometry and electrode instrumentations 
 
In this study, specimens are prepared with the dimensions of 40x40x160 mm, which is suggestively representative 
for material property characterization (in this study, composition, freeze-thaw cycles, and curing age).  Material 
composition of the specimens would be described in later section.  The corresponding electrode instrumentations 
are as shown in Figure 1.  For SC2P, simply two round circles prepared by conductive paste with a 120mm spacing 
are placed on specimens’ surface (Figure 1a).  Similarly, SC4P has four round circles on specimens’ surface with the 
three spacing of 20mm, 80mm, 20mm, respectively (Figure 1d).  SC2R has two surrounded electrodes prepared by 
copper tape along specimens’ perimeters, as shown in Figure 1b.  The two plane probes for SC2L are prepared by 
conductive paste and copper plates that are placed at the two ends of the specimens with a clear electrode spacing 
of 160mm, as depicted in Figure 1c.  It is worth of mentioning that in this study, we polished the specimen end before 
attaching copper plates onto it so as to ensure an interfacial contact between electrodes and concrete elements.  As 
for EB2P, two copper sticks are embedded into specimens’ interior with the electrode spacing of 120mm, as shown 
in Figure 1e.  Similar to SC4P, four electric terminals are placed with the spacing of 20mm, 80mm, 20mm, while the 
copper stick electrode s are embedded into specimens’ interior, as shown in Figure 1f.  It should be noted that the 
embedding depth of the electrode for EB2P and EB4P are 40mm, thoroughly equal to the specimen dimension.

Figure 1: the corresponding six types of electrode instrumentations for electrical resistance measurement 
where A is the cross section area of the specimen (40mm X 40mm) for SC2R and SC2L, half the contact-surface of 
the embedded electrode (0.5 X π X 1mm X 40mm) for EB2P, and the area of the circle electrode for SC2P.  L is the 
distance between the electrodes, as shown in Figure 1. 
Recently, Hou et al. [12] have proposed an approach for computing the electrical resistivity of cement-based 
materials instrumented with embedded four-terminal probe: 
 
)/)ln((// 121 SSSdπIVρ                                                               (3) 
 
where S1 is the spacing of the exterior electrode pair and S2 the interior one.  In this study, S1 = 20mm and S2 = 
80mm.  It should be mentioned that equation (3) is based on the following assumptions: 
1. current moves along the latitude of probe array, as shown in Figure 2 
2. current density is evenly distributed along the probe longitude 
3. the interior electric field of each probe is neglected 
4. potential between the inner electrodes only depends on the resistivity of the conducting medium

3. Results and discussion 
 
3.1 Material composition – static DC resistivity  
 
The four groups of specimens were cured at room temperature for 21 days before static DC resistivity measurement 
was performed.  Electrical instrumentations of the surface-contacted electrodes were installed onto the specimen six 
hours before testing, while the embedded ones were installed upon the casting work of cement mixtures.  Whichever

Group 2 -- 15% Fly Ash
SC2P SC2R SC2L SC4P EB2P EB4P  
a. group 1 – plain cement b. group 2 – 15% fly ash 
values than group 1.  Similarly, the 28-day resistivity of group 2 is about 2.1 times the value of group 1.  Same results 
were all well captured by six types of electrode instrumentations, which suggest that although the bulk material 
resistivity varies with respect to the type of instrumentation, the resistivity growth due to hydration process were not 
twisted or diluted.  These consequences were attributed to the replacement of cement by fly ash and slag, which 
would reduce the concentration of hydroxyl ions (OH–) of the binders and thus, shrink the size of pore distribution 
[13-14].  The OM images taken at 28 days of curing age (Figure 5(a), (b), and (c)) have further confirmed this.
