further improved with the inclusion of SBS or SEBS. 
The stiffness of sPS increased with the sole addition 
of 20A. The addition of SBS or SEBS greatly increased 
the impact strength of the composites, especially 
with the addition of SEBS. The achievement of 
toughened sPS-based nanocomposites was confirmed.

on the thermal treatments [3–7]. Forms α and β are the predominant polymorphs under normal 
crystallization conditions. The less stable α-form exhibits a hexagonal structure [3,4], whereas the 
thermodynamically stable β-form is orthorhombic [5]. The monoclinic forms γ and δ can only be 
obtained through solvent-induced crystallization [6]. The crystallization kinetics and melting 
behavior of sPS have also been investigated [8–15]. Cimmino et al. [8] noted that, under the same 
undercooling, the spherulite growth rate of sPS is more than one order of magnitude faster than that 
of isotactic polystyrene (iPS). Hong et al. [9] observed that sPS shows three melting endotherms 
after isothermal crystallization treatments. The lowest-temperature and the middle-temperature 
melting are attributed to melting of β- and α- form crystals, respectively; the highest-temperature 
melting arises from the melting of recrystallized β-form crystals. Guerra et al. [10] and Sun and 
Woo et al.[11,12] systematically investigated the relationships among crystallization kinetics, 
polymorphic crystals, and the resulting multiple melting peaks in sPS. Basically, a slower 
crystallization process and a higher pre-melting temperature facilitate the formation of β-form 
crystals. 
Studies on sPS-based blends have been conducted to enhance the competitiveness of sPS 
[16–24]. The thermal properties and crystalline morphology of sPS are influenced strongly by the 
incorporation of miscible counterparts. Guerra et al. [16] concluded that the addition of miscible 
poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) but atactic polystyrene (aPS) would be favorable for the formation of 
β-form sPS crystals. Cimmino et al. [17] reported that the crystallization rate of sPS decreases with 
the addition of PPO. Another study [18] has revealed that decreasing the molecular weight of aPS 
decreases the ability of sPS to crystallize, as well as the melting temperatures for sPS/aPS blends. 
Other than the blend systems, sPS-based nanocomposites have recently attracted considerable 
attention due to their potential in displaying more advanced properties [25–30]. Among the 
nano-fillers studied previously, montmorillonite (MMT) clay is recognized as an appropriate choice 
for manufacturing high-performance polymer-based nanocomposites [31,32]. MMT has a 
hydrophilic character and is frequently modified with certain organic surfactants to improve 
compatibility with organic polymer matrices (modified MMT is denoted as O-MMT hereafter) for 
nanocomposites achievement. Wang et al. [25] employed two types of alkyl-imidazoliums as MMT 
surfactants to fabricate sPS/O-MMT nanocomposites. The nanocomposites exhibited enhanced 
thermal stability in comparison with neat sPS, and the β-form sPS crystal became dominant. Tseng 
et al. [26] demonstrated a solution-mixing technique that could lead to sPS nanocomposite 
formation; O-MMT played a vital role in facilitating β-form crystal formation. Wu et al. [27] 
reported the crystallization kinetics and polymorphic behavior of sPS/O-MMT nanocomposites. 
The presence of O-MMT increased heterophase nucleation of the α-form sPS crystal. Sorrentino et 
al. [28] revealed the effect of incorporating O-MMTs on the final properties of injection-molded 
sPS nanocomposites. The addition of a small amount of O-MMT (1%) was noted to widen the 
processing window of sPS.  
As anticipated, sPS/O-MMT nanocomposites exhibit better stiffness and strength in comparison 
with neat sPS. Nevertheless, the impact strength (toughness) of sPS might decline after the addition

observations were performed on ultrathin cryo-microtomed sections of the composite films (ca. 80 
nm) with a JEOL JEM-1230 system using an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. To evaluate phase 
morphology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments were performed on cryo-fractured 
surfaces of the samples using a Hitachi S-3000N system. The samples were immersed in liquid 
nitrogen for 5 min before being fractured, and then were coated with Au prior to SEM observation. A 
Perkin Elmer DSC 7 analyzer equipped with an inter-cooler was used for sample crystallization and 
melting behavior measurements. Nitrogen gas was consistently purged into the DSC during the scans 
to prevent specimens from thermal degradation at high temperatures. The samples were first melted 
at 320 oC for 5 min, followed by cooling to 20 oC at different rates for non-isothermal crystallization 
experiments, or fast-cooling to pre-determined temperatures (Tcs) for isothermal crystallization 
experiments. The crystallized samples were subsequently heated to 320 oC for melting behavior 
evaluation. Thermal stability of the samples was characterized using a thermogravimetric analyzer 
(TGA) on a TA Q50 system under a N2 environment and an air environment at a heating rate of 
20 o
Dynamic mechanical properties of compression-molded specimens (20 mm x 5 mm x 1.9 mm) 
were measured using a Perkin Elmer DMA 7e system. The measurements were carried out in the 
three-point bending mode at a 5 oC/min heating rate at a frequency of 1 Hz under ambient 
atmosphere. Tensile properties (Young’s modulus and elongation at break) of the dumbbell-shaped 
specimens (according to ASTM D638) were determined at a crosshead speed of 10 mm/min using a 
MTS Sintech 5/G system. Flexural moduli of the specimen were determined by the same MTS 
Sintech 5/G system at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. Notched Izod impact tests were performed 
using a CEAST impact tester in accordance with ASTM D256. The tensile/flexural properties and 
impact strength reported were average values from at least five specimens of the same sample.

Results and Discussion 
Dispersibility of 20A 
The dispersibility of 20A within the sPS matrix with and without SBS or SEBS was assessed 
through XRD experiments (in the range of 2θ < 6o), as shown in Figure 1. The (001) diffraction of 
pristine 20A is evident and is located around 2θ = 3.7o, indicating an interlayer spacing (d-spacing) 
of 2.39 nm. For the two composites not containing SBS/SEBS (cf. sPS/C3 and sPS/C5), the (001) 
diffraction of 20A is much weaker (hardly detectable) and is located around 2θ = 2.8o. This result 
suggests that most of the layer-tactoid structure of 20A was intercalated or exfoliated within the sPS 
matrix, regardless of the 20A loading. When SBS or SEBS was further incorporated into the 
composites, (001) diffraction of 20A became somewhat discernible. Diffraction remained at a 
lower angle (2θ < 3o) than that of pristine 20A. This observation implies that, although some 
layered-structure of 20A remains in the sPS/SBS or sPS/SEBS matrix, the intercalation and partial 
exfoliation of 20A continued to occur upon mixing. The presence of SEBS led to a slightly higher 
angle 20A diffraction than that of SBS, indicating that SEBS results in a less extent of 20A 
intercalation and exfoliation.

and SBS/SEBS elastomers. The thermograms of the samples cooled at a rate of 40 oC/min are 
depicted in Figure 4(b). Similar formulation-dependent behaviors were observed, with the 
exception of Tp, which depressed to a lower temperature for individual samples. The representative 
Tps and ∆Hcs of 40 
oC/min-cooled sPS in the samples are shown in Table 2. 
The overall isothermal crystallization kinetics of the samples was studied by monitoring the 
evolution of heat during crystallization at distinct temperatures (Tcs) as a function of time. Figure 5 
illustrates the representative DSC thermograms of neat sPS and sPS/C5 upon isothermal 
crystallization. The crystallization peak time (tp) is defined as the time when the crystallization 
exotherm minimum occurred. A longer tp indicates slower crystallization. Figure 6 depicts tp-1 
versus Tc for neat sPS and its composites. Since tp-1 is proportional to the overall crystallization rate, 
the results indicate that the crystallization rate decreases with Tc for each sample, as anticipated by 
the nucleation-controlled crystal growth theory. Furthermore, at the same Tc, neat sPS crystallizes 
the fastest (the highest tp-1 value), followed by the composites incorporated with 20A exclusively. 
The composites with both 20A and elastomer (either SBS or SEBS) inclusions exhibit even slower 
overall crystallization rates. Higher loadings of 20A and elastomers led to further depression in the 
crystallization rate. The Avrami equation [36] was used to analyze the crystallization kinetics of the 
samples: 
  1-Xt = exp (- Ktn) (1) 
this is always cast into  
 ln [-ln (1 - Xt)] = ln K + n ln t (2) 
where Xt is the fractional crystallinity at time t, n is the Avrami exponent, and K is the kinetic 
constant. The Avrami exponent n can provide qualitative information on the nature of nucleation 
and crystal growth geometry. The K constant is crystallization rate-related; a larger K value 
suggests a faster crystallization rate. The values of n, determined from the Avrami plot (i.e., ln [-ln 
(1 - Xt)] versus ln t) of the samples, range from 4.5 to 5.1 for neat sPS at different Tcs. However, 
the value declines to the range of from 3.5 to 4.3 for the composites. According to Wunderlich [37], 
the n values for neat sPS suggest a thermal nucleation process followed by a three-dimensional and 
branching crystal growth. The lower n values for the composites are indicative of the nucleation 
changes to a mixed athermal/thermal type, thereby also reducing the crystal growth dimension. 
These crystallization kinetics changes can be attributed to the confined/constrained effect from 
dispersed 20A upon the crystallization of sPS. The kinetic K constants were determined to be larger 
for neat sPS at individual Tcs, followed by the sole sPS/20A nanocomposites. The incorporation of 
SBS or SEBS further lowered the K values. 
Figures 7(a) and (b) illustrate the DSC melting curves of the samples cooled from the melt at a 
rate of 10 and 40 °C/min, respectively. For each sample pre-cooled at 10 °C/min, a curve with 
double melting peaks (Peaks I and II) is exhibited, whereas a pre-cooling rate of 40 °C/min causes 
one major melting peak (Peak II) with an ex-minor exothermic shallow. These complex melting 
behaviors are ascribed primarily to the melting–recrystallization–remelting process of sPS crystals 
(β-form crystal) during the heating scans [9,12,14]. A faster pre-cooling rate of 40 °C/min leads to

where 1.8 is the ratio between the intensities of the 2θ diffraction peaks located at 11.6° and 12.2°, 
respectively, for specimens with the same thickness and crystallinity in the pure α- and β-forms. 
Meanwhile, A(11.6) and A(12.2) are the areas of the 2θ diffraction peaks located at 11.6° and 12.2°, 
respectively. Figure 9(a) shows the results of air-quenched samples. Both characteristic diffraction 
peaks with a stronger 2θ = 12.2° peak intensity appear for neat sPS, indicating that the crystals 
formed are mixtures of α- and β-forms. The two characteristic diffractions exist for the composites 
as well, and the intensity of 2θ = 11.6° peak becomes stronger than that of 2θ = 12.2° peak. The 
inclusion of SBS or SEBS in the composites enhances the relative intensity of 2θ  = 11.6° peak. 
Figure 9(b) depicts the spectra of 40 °C/min melt-crystallized samples. Of the two characteristic 
diffractions, only the 2θ = 12.2° diffraction exists for neat sPS. For the composites, a weak 2θ = 
11.6° peak along with the dominant 2θ = 12.2° peak is observed. The relative intensity of 2θ = 
11.6° peak is again noted to be stronger for the composites with SBS or SEBS inclusion compared 
with those without SBS/SEBS. The representative α-form sPS crystal content in the air-quenched 
samples owing to Eq. (3) is listed in Table 2. Scarce reports exist regarding the effect of adding an 
elastomer on the polymorphism of crystalline sPS. The additions of 20A and SBS or SEBS 
therefore increase the possibility of α-form sPS crystal formation. Comparing the results of 
air-quenched samples with those of 40 °C/min melt-crystallized samples confirms that a slower 
cooling rate forms less α-form sPS crystals, regardless of the presence of 20A and/or SBS and 
SEBS.  
Thermal Stability 
The TGA-scanned results of the samples under a N2 environment are shown in Figure 10(a). The 
inclusion of 20A is noted to increase the thermal stability of sPS evidently. The temperature at 10 
wt% (Td,0.1) loss increased from 370 °C for neat sPS to 403 °C for the sPS/C3 composite. The 
sPS/C5 exhibits an even higher Td,0.1 value than that of sPS/C3. The thermal stability of sPS was 
further enhanced with the simultaneous existence of 20A and SBS or SEBS. The presence of SBS 
led to higher degradation temperatures compared with SEBS-included composites. These 
observations can be ascribed to the fine dispersion of 20A and the higher thermal stability of SBS. 
Figure 10(b) illustrates the TGA results of the samples under an air environment. Similar 
formulation-dependent behaviors to those shown in Figure 10(a) are observed, with the exception 
of the presence of oxygen in the air, which led to an inferior thermal stability for individual samples. 
The composites demonstrated higher thermal stability than neat sPS. Of the composites, the 
SBS-included sPS/C5/B20 exhibited the highest thermal stability. The enhancement in the overall 
thermal stability of sPS, from the formation of nanocomposites, was more evident under air 
environment than under N2 environment. The apparent thermal stability enhancement for the 
nanocomposites was mainly a consequence of the homogeneous dispersion of layered-20A, which 
resulted in heat and O2 permeability reductions in the sPS matrix during the heating scans. Some 
representative TGA data are included in Table 2.

Conclusions 
Different formulated sPS-based nanocomposites were successfully prepared using a twin-screw 
extruder. The dispersibility of an O-MMT (20A) within sPS matrix with and without SBS or SEBS 
elastomers was evaluated. The crystalline structure and thermal/mechanical properties of the 
samples were also investigated. The XRD and TEM results indicate that the layered 20A was 
mainly intercalated and/or partially exfoliated within the sPS matrix. However, further 
incorporation of SBS or SEBS slightly depreciated the dispersibility of 20A. The presence of 20A 
and SBS/SEBS favored the α-form sPS crystal development in the composites. The crystallization 
rate of sPS was inhibited with the addition of 20A, and was further decreased in the presence of 
SBS/SEBS. Results show that 20A and SBS/SEBS induced a higher amount of the less stable 
β-form sPS crystals in comparison with neat sPS under the same crystallization conditions. TGA 
data confirm the thermal stability enhancement of sPS after adding 20A; the inclusion of SBS or 
SEBS further increased thermal stability, especially with SBS inclusion. The storage modulus, 
Young’s modulus, and flexural modulus of sPS increased with the inclusion of 20A. The addition of 
SBS or SEBS, however, produced a decrease in these properties. Nevertheless, the addition of SBS 
or SEBS led to an apparent toughening effect on sPS/20A nanocomposites, especially with the 
addition of SEBS. The successful preparation of toughened sPS-based nanocomposites was 
concluded.

Different formulated syndiotactic polystyrene (sPS)-based nanocomposites were successfully prepared
using a twin-screw extruder. The dispersion status of an organoclay (20A) within sPS matrix with and
without SBS or SEBS elastomers was evaluated. The crystalline structure and thermal/mechanical
properties of the samples were also examined. The morphology results indicate that the layered 20A
was mainly intercalated and/or partially exfoliated within the sPS matrix. Further incorporation of the
elastomers slightly depreciated the dispersibility of 20A. The presence of organoclay favored the -
form sPS crystal development in the composites. The crystallization rate of sPS was retarded with the
addition of 20A, and was further decreased in the presence of SBS/SEBS. TGA scan results
demonstrate the thermal stability enhancement of sPS after adding 20A. The thermal stability was
further improved after the incorporation of individual elastomer, especially with SBS inclusion. The
stiffness (e.g., storage modulus, Young’s modulus, and flexural modulus) of sPS increased with the
inclusion of 20A. The addition of SBS or SEBS led to an apparent toughening effect on sPS/20A
nanocomposites, especially with the addition of SEBS.
