Abstract 
BexCd1-xSe 【grown by high pressure Bridgman method (wurtzite) and MBE (zinc-blend) 】 , 
Cd0.85Mg0.15Se and Cd1–x–yBexZnySe mixed alloys were characterized by contactless electroreflectance 
(CER), photoreflectance (PR) and Photoluminescence (PL). The parameters describe the 
temperature variation of the II-VI mixed crystals were determined and analyzed via 
Varshni and Bose-Einstein fit .  
Temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL), room temperature phototransmittance (PT), 
contactless electroreflectance (CER) and wavelength modulated surface photovoltage spectroscopy 
(WMSPS) measurements are utilized to study the effects of growth interruption times, combined with 
Sb exposure of GaAsSb/GaAs multiple quantum wells (MQWs) structures. The influence of the 
interband transition of GaAsSb/GaAs MQWs were observed and the parable origins 
were also discussed.  
Highly strained InGaAs(Sb)/GaAs double quantum wells (DQWs) structures grown with Sb 
assistance under different Sb/V ratios by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) have been 
characterized as a function of temperature by the techniques of contactless electroreflectance (CER) 
and photoluminescence (PL). The parameters that describe the temperaturedependence of the 
interband transition energies are evaluated and discussed. 
The multiple stacked InAs quantum dots (QDs) were characterizaed by surface photovoltage 
spectroscopy (SPS) and photoluminescence (PL). The effect of the multiple stacked InAs QDs was 
discussed. 
The In0.176Ga0.824P1−yNy (y = 1.5%–8.7%) alloys grown on GaP(001) substrates via metalorganic 
vapour phase epitaxy were characterized by surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) in the 
temperature range between 125 and 400 K. The parameters that describe the temperature variations of 
the band gap energies are evaluated and discussed.

Received 9 March 2007; accepted 28 March 2007
A detailed optical characterization of a series of wurtzite-type Cd1−x−yBexZnySe mixed crystals
grown by the modified high pressure Bridgman method has been carried out via photoluminescence
PL and contactless electroreflectance CER in the temperature range of 15–300 K. Room
temperature surface photovoltage spectroscopy has been used as a diagnostic technique for checking
the surface condition of the sample. For the mechanically polished sample, the surface photovoltage
spectrum at room temperature recorded a below band edge broad feature which is most likely related
to the surface states induced by mechanical defect. This feature can be eliminated via mechanical
polishing and followed by chemical etching, and hence, only the exciton line was observed for the
damage-removed sample. Typical PL spectrum at low temperature consists of an exciton line, an
edge emission due to recombination of shallow donor-acceptor pairs, and a broadband related to
recombination through deep level defects. Various interband transitions, originating from the band
edge and spin-orbit splitting critical points, of the samples have been observed in the CER spectra.
Comparison of PL and CER data for the Cd1−x−yBexZnySe samples shows that for a low Zn and Be
content the peak positions of the excitonic emission lines in the PL spectra correspond quite well to
the transition energies of the A exciton from the CER data. For samples with higher Be and Zn
contents, the results indicate that localization of excitons has taken place at low temperatures. The
parameters that describe the temperature dependence of the transition energy and broadening
parameter of the fundamental band edge exciton have been evaluated and discussed. © 2007

I. INTRODUCTION
Be-chalcogenide semiconductor alloys have been re-
cently proposed for improving the performance of ZnSe-
based blue-green lasers.1,2 According to theoretical
calculation,3 it is known that due to its large amount of co-
valent bonding and high cohesive energy,4 the beryllium-
based bonding can be used to enhance the crystal elastic
rigidity in II–VI alloys. It is expected that the incorporation
of beryllium will lead to bond strengthening within the II–VI
lattice, and also will increase the energy of stacking-fault
formation, thus reducing defect propagation that has been
seriously limiting the lifetimes of ZnSe-based devices.
Among the Be-based II–VI compound semiconductors,
Cd1−x−yBexZnySe solid solutions are of particular interest for
their potential application in photodetectors operating in the
visible and ultraviolet UV spectral region, in constructing
green lasers and full-color visible light emitting diodes
LEDs due to a large difference in the energy gaps Eg of
binary constituents.5 To date, in spite of their potential appli-
cations, very little work has been done on these quaternary
compounds. There are some literature data concerning modu-
lation reflectance and luminescence in Cd1−x−yBexZnySe thin
layers grown on InP,5,6 but the basic crystallographic and
optical properties of Cd1−x−yBexZnySe bulk solid solutions
are only known a little.7,8
In this work we present a detailed temperature-
dependent photoluminescence PL and contactless electrore-
flectance CER characterization of a series of wurtzite-type
WZ Cd1−x−yBexZnySe mixed crystals with 0x0.15 and
0y0.45, in the range of 15–300 K. Room-temperature
surface photovoltage spectroscopy SPS has been used as a
technique for checking the surface condition of the sample.
The crystals were grown by the modified high pressure
Bridgman method from the melt. PL spectra at low tempera-
ture consist of a band edge exciton line and defect related
emission bands. The peak positions of the exciton emission
lines in the PL spectra are compared with the energies of the
fundamental transitions determined from CER spectra. The
parameters that describe the temperature dependence of the
transition energy and broadening parameter of the fundamen-
tal band edge exciton are evaluated and discussed.

noted as X followed by a broader emission band at an en-
ergy 80–95 meV lower than the first peak and a broad deep
level DL band. These low temperature PL spectra are gen-
erally similar to those of Zn1−xBexSe.11 The sharp feature in
the PL spectra shows a blueshift in the transition energy and
a line broadening with the increase of Be and Zn contents.
The line broadening for the samples with large Be/Zn con-
tents can be attributed in part, to the alloy scattering effects
and most likely, in a larger proportion due to the poorer
crystalline quality of the samples with higher content of be-
ryllium incorporated. We have also observed a strong sup-
pression of the DL emission at low temperature for sample I,
an indication of a reasonably good quality crystal with a low
Be x=0.03 content. In general, the intensity ratio of the
sharp peak on the high energy side of the PL spectrum to that
of the broad DL emission band can be used as an indicator of
the material quality.

where Aj and  j are the amplitude and phase of the line
shape, Ej and  j are the energy and broadening parameter of
the transitions, and the value of n depends on the origin of
the transitions. For the first derivative functional form, N
=2 is appropriate for the bound states such as excitons and
N=2.5 often used for bulk-like M0 critical points
transitions.12 At 15 K, the CER spectra for the samples with
Be content up to 0.1 have three distinct exciton resonances as
indicated by the vertical arrows in Fig. 3a, while sample
with a higher Be content x=0.15, sample IV, only two
features are observed. Three excitons referred to as the A, B,
and C excitons are related to the 9V→7C, 7Vupper band
→7C, 7Vlower band →7C interband transitions of WZ-
Cd1−x−yBexZnySe. The crystal field splitting, E0B−E0A,
is 20 meV and the spin-orbit splitting, E0C−E0A, is
420 meV. At 300 K, see Fig. 3b, the sharp features on the
lower-energy side that correspond to the A and B excitons
are not clearly resolved. We have fitted the entire range of
the spectra with only two transitions, excitons A and C, in-
dicated by the vertical arrows. The experimental signature
for E0A is more consistent with excitonic line shape while
the signature for E0C has a better fit with N=2.5. It can be
anticipated that at higher temperature the excitonic contribu-
tion is less pronounced for the spin-orbit split-off transition.
We emphasize, however, that the transition energies ex-
tracted from such fits are relatively insensitive to the line
shape function. It is noticed that the splitting between A and
C excitonic transition energies has similar values at 15 and
300 K.
The temperature evolution of PL spectra and CER spec-
tra in the vicinity of the band edge exciton transitions for the
four samples are plotted in Figs. 4a–4d, respectively. It
can be seen that at the higher energy side of the PL spectra,
the peak X shifts monotonically toward lower energy with
increasing temperature in the range from 15 to 300 K and the
broader band donor-acceptor pairs DAP is completely
thermally quenched at temperatures higher than about 100 K.
To examine the origin of these two near band edge lumines-
cence features, the excitation intensity dependent PL mea-
surements have also been carried out at 15 K. For the peak X,
a linear dependence with a slope near unity was obtained.
Furthermore, no shift of the emission energy as a function of
the excitation laser density was observed. The results indi-
cate that this luminescence line is dominated by excitonic

to the transition energies of the A exciton obtained from CER
measurements. A slightly different behavior is observed for
samples with a higher Be and Zn contents. In the case of
photoexcitation, electron-hole pairs are generated at the en-
tire absorption band range and then thermalized toward its
bottom in a time much shorter than the radiative lifetime of
excitons. It is known that the absorption and reflectance re-
flect the energetic distribution of the density of excitonic
states, while the luminescence spectra are determined by
their degree of filling. The common feature of ternary II–VI
solid solutions is, as observed at low temperatures, a shift of
the exciton luminescence line toward lower energies as com-
pared to that of free exciton ground state determined from
low temperature absorption/reflectance.15 This feature is as-
sociated with exciton localization process due to composi-
tional disorder. In the investigated Cd1−x−yBexZnySe crystals
with low Be and Zn sample I contents the energetic posi-
tion of the maximum of the excitonic PL line is shifted a few
millielectron-volts meV toward lower energies from the
corresponding energies of A excitons determined from CER
spectra in the temperature range from 15 to 300 K see Fig.
5. The character of the temperature dependence of the ener-
getic position of PL excitonic peak follows the CER data.
For higher Be and Zn contents, however, the difference be-
tween exciton energy determined from PL and CER spectra
become noticeably larger at low temperatures than at higher
ones. For the Cd0.6Be0.1Zn0.3Se sample, the difference be-
tween PL and ER data at 15 K is about two times larger than
that at 300 K. This result is quite different from the data for
Cd0.94Be0.03Zn0.03Se, where the PL and CER data are almost
similar. This indicates that some localization of excitons has
taken place at low temperatures in Cd1−x−yBexZnySe crystals
with larger Be and Zn contents.
The experimental values of the temperature dependence
of the linewidth T of the band edge exciton emission are
displayed in Figs. 6a–6d for samples IIV, respectively.
Representative error bars are shown. Initially, T increases
linearly with T, but begins to be superlinear starting from
about 150 K. The temperature dependence of the linewidth
of excitonic transitions in semiconductors can be expressed

Abstract
We present an optical characterization of a Bridgman-grown wurtzite-type
Cd0.85Mg0.15Se mixed crystal in the near-band-edge interband transitions us-
ing temperature-dependent contactless electroreflectance (CER) and photore-
flectance (PR) in the temperature range 15–400 K. The interband excitonic tran-
sitions A and C originating from the band edge and spin–orbital splitting critical
points of the sample, respectively, have been observed in the CER/PR spectra.
The transition energies and broadening function of the excitonic features are
determined via a lineshape fit to the CER/PR spectra. The parameters that de-
scribe the temperature dependence of the transition energies of excitons A and
C, and the broadening function of exciton A, are evaluated and discussed.
1. Introduction
The Mg-based II–VI semiconductors have recently attracted much attention because of Q.1
their potential applications in the field of blue–green light sources and other optoelectronic
devices [1]. These alloy systems have the possibility of tuning the band gap and lattice constants
by varying the Mg concentration so that they can easily be matched with III–V substrates.
Considerable work has been devoted to the study of the device applications as well as to the
physical properties of the Mg-based II–VI alloys [2–6]. Among the Mg-based II–VI alloy
systems, however, Cd1−x Mgx Se has not been studied more extensively than the other systems
in spite of its suitability for optoelectronic device application in the range of the entire visible
spectrum from the band gap 1.74 eV of CdSe to 4.0 eV of MgSe [7]. To date, only a few
papers have been reported on the recombination processes in Cd1−x Mgx Se crystals and the

mixed crystal (a) untreated, (b) polished and chemically etched for 1.5 h, (c) polished and
chemically etched method for 3 h; (d) CER and (e) PR spectra for the damage-removed WZ-type
Cd0.85Mg0.15Se mixed crystal near-band-edge at 300 K.
Q.A
A dual-phase lock-in amplifier was used to measure the detected signals. In PR measurements,
the modulation of the built-in electric field is caused by photoexcited electron–hole pairs created
by a mechanically chopped 325 nm line (∼1 mW) of a He–Cd laser. The modulating frequency
is set at 200 Hz. The entire data acquisition procedure was performed under computer control.
Multiple scans over a given photon energy range were programmed until a desired signal-
to-noise level was attained. For temperature-dependent measurements, an RMC model 22
closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped with a digital thermometer controller was used
for the low-temperature measurements. For the high-temperature experiments, the sample was
mounted on one side of a copper finger of an electrical heater, which enabled one to control
and stabilize the sample temperature. The temperature-dependent measurements were made
between 15 and 400 K with a temperature stability of 0.5 K or better.
3. Results and discussion
As emphasized earlier, a proper surface treatment of the sample must be performed to eliminate
the damaged layer formed on the surface caused by mechanical polishing. The SPS technique
can be utilized to check the condition of the surface layer. The existence of such damage
is revealed by the SPS spectra of the untreated and treated Cd0.85Mg0.15Se mixed crystal, as
depicted by the full curve in figures 1(a)–(c). The dotted curves in figures 1(a)–(c) represent,
respectively, the numerically computed normalized first derivative of the surface photovoltage
(DSPV) signal with respect to the photon energy (V/E) of the untreated and treated sample.
The SPV (DSPV) spectra of the as-received sample as depicted in figure 1(a) consist of a
dominant defect-related broad feature in the energy range 1.85–1.95 eV. However, after surface
treatment of 1.5 h of mechanical polishing followed by chemical etching, the SPV (DSPV)
spectra showed an exciton line together with a significant reduction of the defect-related feature,
as illustrated in figure 1(b). Figure 1(c) shows the SPV (DSPV) spectra of the sample with
3 h of mechanical polishing followed by chemical etching. After such a surface treatment

as determined by Firszt et al [10] from spectroscopic ellipsometric measurements performed
at room temperature. They also reported the energy of the C exciton to be 2.429 eV, which
is nearly identical to the position of the highest energy feature for the presently investigated
sample. The work of Firszt et al [10] gives the energy separation of the A and C excitons to
be 430 meV, which agrees well with the energy difference of 431 meV as evaluated from the
present CER measurements for the lowest and the highest energy features. We can therefore
assign the lowest energy feature to be the A exciton and the highest energy feature to be the C
exciton. Turning our attention to the feature at 2.197 eV (15 K), denoted as X, we found that
the energy separation between this second feature and exciton A is ∼107 meV; this is much
larger than the room-temperature energy difference between A and B excitons of ∼40 meV
for WZ-type CdSe [13]. Therefore, the assignment of the feature at 2.197 eV (15 K) as the
B exciton may not be appropriate. The origin of this feature is not clear, and it is tentatively
attributed to the coexistence of some other polytypic phases with wurtzite as the main phase in
the Mg-containing crystal.
Plotted by the solid circles and solid diamonds in figure 3 are the temperature variations
of the experimental values of EA0 (T ) and EC0 (T ), respectively, with the representative error
bars for a WZ-type Cd0.85Mg0.15Se mixed crystal. The full curves are least-squares fits to the
Varshni semi-empirical relationship [14] as given by

α j T 2

Here j refers to either A or C exciton transitions, E j0 (0) is the energy at 0 K; α j and β j are
constants. The constant α j is related to the electron (exciton)–average phonon interaction and
β j is closely related to the Debye temperature. The values obtained for E j0 (0), α j and β j are
listed in table 1. For comparison, the parameters for the near-band-edge transition energies
of WZ-type Cd0.925Be0.075Se [15], WZ-type CdSe [13], zinc blende (ZB)-type ZnSe [16], and

Its drawback is that many parameters are necessary in the
curve-fitting process to analyze the data due to changes in
both the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant.
On the other hand, SPS is like the PR technique. It is
nondestructive and contactless, but possesses several advan-
tages over PR. Surface photovoltage spectroscopy SPS has
been well established as a powerful technique for studying
electronic states of semiconductors.13 For instance, there are
no below-band-gap oscillations originating from the heavily
doped substrates, and in this case PR is not useful.14,15 The
SPS technique requires both photogeneration and the spatial
separation of excess charge carriers. Therefore, the informa-
tion about both the optical and electrical properties of the
structure can be revealed in the surface photovoltage SPV
spectrum.
In practice, it is possible to grow QD structures with
many dot layers. However, complications may arise as the
structural and electronic properties of InAs dots are found to
be strongly dependent on the GaAs spacer thickness between
adjacent dot layers, the number of deposition cycles, and the
growth conditions of dot formation. Therefore, the knowl-
edge and eventually the control of the structural and elec-
tronic coupling in QD superlattice structures are of utmost
importance in terms of device applications.
To date, very little work has been done on multilayer
InAs/GaAs QD structures N10 by using SPS.16,17 In par-
ticular, studies of the influence of the InAs growth conditions
and QD superlattices structural parameters on their optical
properties have not been reported in the literature yet. In this
article, optical properties of InAs/GaAs QD superlattice
structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy MBE, with
different layer numbers N and thickness of spacer layer d, are
systematically investigated. SPV signals from the barrier/
substrate, wetting layer WL, ground state, and excited
states of QDs have been observed and identified. The spec-
tral shift toward either the high- or low-energy side can be
changed by tuning the dot growth conditions and superlattice
parameters. Several mechanisms invoked for interpreting the
experimental results will be presented and discussed.
II. EXPERIMENT
In this study, eight QD superlattice structures, denoted as
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H were synthesized and character-
ized. These samples were divided into two groups G0 and
G1 according to the controlled geometry and growth condi-
tions. Groups G0 and G1 were both grown on n+ and semi-
insulating S.I. GaAs001 substrates by MBE. Group G0
consists of 30 periodically arranged layers of InAs QDs with
spacings d=30, 20, 15, and 10 nm designated as samples B,
C, D, and E, respectively. A single-layer QD structure was
used as a reference sample and denoted as sample A. Group
G1 consists of samples separated by a GaAs spacer thickness
of d=15 nm with different layer numbers N=1, 10, and 30
designated as samples F, G, and H, respectively. The QDs
were grown in Stranski-Krastanow growth mode by deposit-
ing 2.6 monolayers MLs of InAs with growth rates and the
substrate temperatures of 0.029 ML/s and 485 °C, and of
0.085 ML/s and 510 °C for groups G0 and G1, respectively.
The formation of QDs was controlled in situ by monitoring
the high-energy electron diffraction RHEED. The QD
nucleation was seen directly via the onset of a spotty
RHEED pattern. The surface density of the QDs, estimated
from atomic force microscopic AFM images, was approxi-
mated to be 2–51010 cm−2. After the deposition of QDs, a
10 nm thick GaAs layer was deposited uninterrupted at the
same temperature to cover the surface; then, the growth tem-
perature of the remaining layers was changed to 600 °C to
improve the crystalline quality. The growth conditions of the
studied samples in this work are listed in Table I.
In the SPV measurements, the photovoltage was mea-
sured between the sample and a reference metal grid elec-
trode in a capacitive manner as a function of the photon
energy of the probe beam. A soft contact mode was used to
enhance the photovoltage signals. The method consisted of
placing a thin indium wire around the edge of the sample
surface with the metal grid pressing lightly on top. The illu-
mination system consisted of a 150 W quartz-halogen lamp
chopped at 200 Hz and a grating monochromator. A beam
splitter was placed in the path of the incident light. The in-
tensity of this radiation was monitored by a pyroelectric de-
tector and was kept constant by a stepping motor connected
to a variable neutral density filter, which also was placed in
the path of the incident beam. The incident light intensity
was maintained at a constant level of 10−5 W/cm2. The
SPV spectrum on the metal grid was measured with a copper
plate as the ground electrode, using a buffer circuit and a
lock-in amplifier. All SPV data measurements reported here
are carried out at room temperature.
The PL measurements were recorded by using the He-Ne
633 nm/Nd-YAG 532 nm/He-Cd 325 nm laser as an

tron microscopy TEM image of Fig. 2, where indeed some
uncoupled dots are situated near the bottom QD layers.
It is noted that as the spacer thickness is reduced below
20 nm, the transition energies of samples D and E are con-
siderably blueshifted with respect to those of sample B. This
finding, which is inconsistent with the redshift observed by
others, is explained by the increase of the dot size caused by
strain field coupling20,21 and the formation of a miniband
created by the electronic coupling in the vertical direction.22
Here, the probable mechanism responsible for the energetic
blueshift is assigned to the enhanced strain induced intermix-
ing occurring during the growth of the QD superlattice.
Many studies showed evidence e.g., in Ref. 23 that the dots
may contain significant concentrations of Ga rather than be-
ing pure InAs. The increase of band gap energy arising from
the incorporation of Ga composition into QDs overcompen-
sates for the size increase, and hence results in a blueshift of
transition energy.
To investigate the dependence of the energetic shift of
the excitonic transitions on the growth conditions, a series of
QD superlattice samples in group G1 was used for analysis.
The parameters of these samples were N=1, 10, and 30; a
constant spacer thickness of d=15 nm for samples F, G, and
H, respectively; a growth substrate temperature of 510 °C;
and an InAs deposition rate of 0.085 ML/s. In addition to
signals from the 3D GaAs barrier and the 2D wetting layer,
the QDs related transitions QD1–QD4, are presented in Fig.
4. As a comparison of the QD transition energies in samples
F and A both grown with the single dot layer, the ground-
state transition of sample F is shifted to a higher energy by
4 meV with respect to that of sample A. It is known that
the deposition temperature has a significant effect on the to-
tal volume of material in the dots; the higher the temperature,
the greater volume for a given amount of deposition. Given
that the substrate temperature used during the growth for
sample F is higher, the optical transition would shift toward
the lower energy side. Obviously, this prediction is contrary
to the present experimental observation, implying that the
growth rate of InAs plays a dominant role in determining the
energetic shift of quantum levels of QDs. Note that for
samples in group G1, the spectral position of QD1 is red-
shifted by 56 meV as N increases from 1 to 10 and then is
slightly blueshifted by 3 meV as N increases further to 30.
Increasing the number of deposition periods generally leads
to a redshift of the SPV spectra due to the electronic cou-
pling of charge carriers within the stacked dot columns. The
deviation is indicative of the effect of material intermixing
being gradually enhanced with increasing N, preventing
sample H from further shifting the spectral position to the
lower energy side. As mentioned earlier, the large strain en-
ergy may serve as a driving force for material intermixing.
The resultant strain field of QDs within the stacked column
is superposed by the individual field from the constituent dot.
With increasing N and with decreasing d, the accumulated
strain field grows dramatically, stimulating the material inter-
mixing to take place. Furthermore, a larger transition energy
of QD1 for sample D than that for sample H is observed.
Both samples have the same values of N and d but the latter
has a higher growth rate. This reveals that the effect of ma-
terial intermixing in sample H has been suppressed in the
growth process to a certain extent. Increasing the growth rate
causes the formation of dots to be farther from the thermo-
dynamic equilibrium condition, resulting in a relaxation of
the intermixing. Surprisingly, the transition energy at QD1 is
0.942 eV for sample G and 0.945 eV for sample H, corre-
sponding to the absorption wavelengths of 1.316 and
1.312 m, respectively. The result suggests that these QD
superlattice structures can be used as promising active media
for long-wavelength QD lasers operating at 1.3 m.

Abstract
Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) characterization of a series of
wurtzite-type Cd1−x−yBex ZnySe mixed crystals has been carried out in the
temperature range between 15 and 300 K. The samples were grown by the
modified high pressure Bridgman method. A typical PL spectrum at low
temperature consists of an exciton line, an edge emission due to recombination
of shallow donor–acceptor pairs and a broad band related to recombination
through deep level defects. The peak positions of the excitonic emission
line in the PL spectra correspond quite well to the transition energies of
exciton A from previously reported electromodulation reflectance data (Liu et al
2005 J. Appl. Phys. 98 083519). The parameters that describe the temperature
dependence of the transition energy and broadening parameter of the band-edge
excitonic emission are evaluated and discussed.
1. Introduction
Be-chalcogenide semiconductor alloys have recently been proposed for improving the
performance of ZnSe-based blue–green lasers [1, 2]. It is expected that the incorporation
of beryllium will lead to bond strengthening within the II–VI lattice, and will also increase
the energy of stacking-fault formation, thus reducing defect propagation that has been
seriously limiting the lifetimes of ZnSe-based devices. Among the Be-based II–VI compound
semiconductors, Cd1−x−y Bex ZnySe solid solutions are of particular interest for their potential
application in photodetectors operating in the visible and UV spectral region, in constructing
green lasers and full-colour visible LEDs due to a large difference in the energy gaps Eg of

quality. However, it is worth mentioning that the sharp peak X (exciton emission as will be
discussed later) is observed in the temperature range from 15 K to room temperature in all
investigated samples indicating that the quality of crystals is rather good.
The temperature evolution of the PL spectra for the four samples is plotted in figures 2(a)–
(d), respectively. It can be seen that at the higher energy side the peak X shifts monotonically
towards lower energy with increasing temperature in the range from 15 to 300 K and the broader
band (DAP) is completely thermally quenched at temperatures higher than about 100 K. To
examine the origin of these two near band-edge luminescence features, excitation intensity-
dependent PL measurements were also been carried out at 15 K. Figure 3 illustrates the power
density dependence of the luminescence intensity of the peak X and peak positions of these
two features for sample II (Cd0.8Zn0.1Be0.1Se). As shown in figure 3, the emission energy of
peak X is independent of the excitation intensity but its intensity (as illustrated in the inset of
figure 3) rises almost linearly with the increase in the excitation intensity. The results indicate
that this luminescence line is dominated by excitonic radiative recombination. On the other
hand, the broader emission band shifts toward higher photon energies with increasing intensity
of exciting radiation. Taking into account the blue-shift with increasing excitation intensity as
well as the thermal quenching, the broader feature is interpreted as due to recombination of
shallow donor–acceptor pairs (DAP). This emission is known in II–VI binary compounds and
is commonly called the ‘edge emission’.
It is not possible from the presented luminescence data to establish the exact nature of
the centres responsible for this PL band, but taking into account the detailed investigations of
luminescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in binary II–VI compounds
(ZnSe, ZnS, CdS), one can conclude that this band is due to radiative recombination of shallow
donor–acceptor pairs, where the acceptor is Li or Na substituting a cation in the crystal lattice,
but the donor is an isolated group III element in a cation site, Li interstitial or VSe–LiZn complex.
This kind of luminescence was always observed in all ZnSe/CdSe-based crystals grown in
our laboratory with the same Bridgman method using the same ZnSe and CdSe powder as in
this work. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the integrated intensity of the DAP
emission band for sample II. The value of the activation energy is determined to be 75±5 meV
from the thermal quenching observed for the DAP band. This value is considerably smaller
than that of ZnSe and Zn1−xMgx Se reported by Firszt [9].

the excitonic transitions in the PL spectra exhibit monotonically red-shifted and line-shape
broadening characteristics. The line broadening of the features is mainly due to the increase
of exciton–phonon interaction effects. Plotted by the open squares, open diamonds, open
circles and open triangles in figure 5 are the temperature variations of the peak positions with
representative error bars for Cd1−x−yBex ZnySe samples I, II, III and IV, respectively. For
comparison purposes, the experimental values of exciton A for samples I, II and III obtained
from electromodulation [5] are also depicted in figure 5 by solid squares, solid diamonds and
solid circles, respectively. The full curve in figure 5 is a least-squares fit to the Varshni semi-
empirical relationship [10] as given by equation (1),

(β + T ) . (1)
Here E(0) is the energy at 0 K and α and β are constants. The constant α is related
to the electron (exciton)-average phonon interaction and β is closely related to the Debye
temperature [10]. The values obtained for E(0), α and β are listed in table 1. For comparison,
the parameters for the near-band-edge transition energies of ZB-Cd1−x−yBex ZnySe [4], WZ-
Cd1−x−yBex ZnySe [5], ZB-ZnSe [11], ZB-Zn0.56Cd0.44Se [11], WZ-CdSe [12], GaAs [13],
InP [14] and WZ-GaN [15] are also listed in table 1.
The temperature dependence of the peak positions of the band-edge exciton lines can also
be described by a Bose–Einstein-type expression [16]:
E(T ) = E(0) − 2aB/[exp(B/T ) − 1], (2)
where E(0) is the transition energy at T = 0 K, aB represents the strength of the electron
(exciton)-average phonon interaction and B corresponds to the average phonon temperature.
Shown by the dotted line in figure 5 is a least-squares fit to equation (2). The obtained
values for the various fitting parameters are also given in table 1. For comparison purposes,
the parameters for the near-band-edge transition energies of ZB-Cd1−x−yBex ZnySe [4], WZ-
Cd1−x−yBex ZnySe [5], ZnSe [11], ZB-Zn0.56Cd0.44Se [11], GaAs [13], InP [14] and WZ-
GaN [15] are also listed in table 1.
The parameter α of equation (1) can be related to aB and B in equation (2) by taking
the high-temperature limit of both expressions. This yields α = 2aB/B. Comparison of the
numbers presented in table 1 shows that this relation is indeed satisfied. From equation (2),
it is straightforward to show that the high temperature limit of the slope of the E(T ) versus

life-time of excitons. It is known that the absorption and reflectivity spectra reflect the
energetic distribution of the density of excitonic states, while the luminescence spectra are
determined by their degree of filling. The common feature of ternary II–VI solid solutions
is, as observed at low temperatures, a shift of the exciton luminescence line towards lower
energies as compared to that of free exciton ground state determined from low temperature
reflectivity spectra [17–19]. This feature is associated with an exciton localization process due
to compositional disorder. In the investigated Cd1−x−y Bex ZnySe crystals with low Be and Zn
(for example, sample I) content the energetic position of the maximum of the excitonic PL line
is shifted a few meV towards lower energies from the corresponding energies of A excitons
determined from the ER spectra in the temperature range from 15 K to room temperature (see
figure 5). The character of the temperature dependence of the energetic position of the PL
excitonic peak follows the ER data. For higher Be and Zn content, however, the difference
between exciton energy determined from PL and ER spectra becomes noticeably larger at low
temperatures (at around 15 K) than at higher ones. For the Cd0.60Be0.10Zn0.30Se sample, the
difference between PL and ER data at 15 K is about two times larger than that at 300 K. This

excitonic transitions of semiconductors can be expressed as [20]

In equation (3), (0) represents the broadening invoked from temperature-independent
mechanisms, such as electron–electron interaction, impurity, dislocation and alloy scattering,
whereas the second term corresponds to lifetime broadening due to the exciton–acoustical
phonon interaction with γAC being the acoustic phonon coupling constant. The third term
is caused by the exciton–LO phonon (Fro¨hlich) interaction. The quantity LO represents the
strength of the exciton–LO phonon coupling while LO is the LO phonon temperature [16, 20].

employed photoluminescence (PL) spectra at low temperature; therefore, most of the electro-
optical properties that have been examined have been limited to low temperatures. Detailed
studies of the electro-optical characteristics at room temperature and higher temperatures are
not only interesting but also necessary and important.
In this study, surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SPS) was used to characterize the
In0.176Ga0.824P1−yNy (y = 1.5%–8.7%) alloys grown on GaP(001) substrates by metalorganic
vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE). The photovoltage is mainly generated in the space-charge
region at the surface. The SPS characterization was made in the temperature range from 125 to
400 K. The band gap energies are determined and their temperature dependences are analysed
by the Varshni expression [10] and an expression containing the Bose–Einstein occupation
factor for phonons [11, 12]. The parameters that describe the temperature variations of the
band gap energies are evaluated and discussed.
2. Experimental details
Four In0.176Ga0.824P1−yNy (y = 1.5%–8.7%) alloy films were grown on GaP(001) substrates
by low-pressure (60 Torr) MOVPE. Trimethylgallium (TMG), trimethylindium (TMI), PH3 and
dimethylhydrazine (DMHy) were used as the source materials. After growth of a 0.3 μm-thick
GaP buffer layer at 710 ◦C, a 0.3 μm-thick InGaPN epitaxial layer was deposited at 635 ◦C. The
growth rate was around 1.0 μm h−1. Films with various nitrogen concentrations were obtained
by changing the molar flow ratio of DMHy to the total group V elements (DMHy + PH3).
The alloy compositions were determined from high-resolution x-ray diffraction and secondary
ion mass spectroscopy data. For comparison purposes, an In0.176Ga0.824P/GaP sample without
nitrogen was also grown and characterized.
In SPS measurement, the contact potential difference between the sample and a reference
grid electrode is measured in a capacitive manner as a function of the photon energy of the
probe beam by holding the grid fixed and chopping the probe beam at 200 Hz [13]. The light
from a 150 W quartz–halogen lamp was passed through a PTI 0.25 m grating monochromator
and focused onto the samples. It is known that, under low optical excitation, the photovoltage
(PV ) signal is proportional to the absorption coefficient α multiplied by the photon flux density
 (PV ∝ α) [14, 15]. To verify that the measurements were performed under low optical
excitation, the amplitude of the photovoltage near peak position was checked with various
light intensities I between 5 × 10−6 and 5 × 10−4 W cm−2. The results indicate that, for
I  3 × 10−4 W cm−2, PV varies linearly with incident light intensity. Subsequently, incident
light intensity maintained at a constant level of ∼10−4 W cm−2 was used for the study. A
beam splitter was placed in the path of the incident light. The intensity of this radiation was
monitored by a power meter and was kept constant by a stepping motor connected to a variable
neutral density filter placed in the path of the incident beam. The photovoltage spectrum on
the metal grid was measured with a copper plate as the ground electrode, using a buffer circuit
and a lock-in amplifier. A CTI model 22 closed-cycle cryogenic refrigeration system equipped
with a model 32B digital temperature controller was used for low-temperature measurements.
For the high-temperature experiments, each sample was mounted on one side of a copper finger
of an electric heater, which enabled one to control and stabilize the sample temperature. The
measurements were made with a temperature stability of 0.5 K or better.

of the band gap in those materials. This behaviour is usually described well by the quadratic
correction Eg(x) = bx(x − 1), with b being the bowing coefficient. The obtained bowing

InGaAs(Sb)/GaAs double quantum wells (DQWs) structures grown with Sb assistance under different Sb/V 
ratios by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) have been characterized as a function of temperature 
in the temperature range between 17 and 300 K by the techniques of contactless electroreflectance (CER) 
and photoluminescence (PL). The interband transition energies are determined via a lineshape fit to the CER 
spectra and exhibit a slight redshift with the incorporation of Sb. The PL spectra show redshifted peak locati-
on with decreasing intensity and broadened full width at half maximum with increasing Sb/V ratio during 
MOVPE growth. A careful analysis of CER and PL spectra has led to the identification of various excitonic 
transitions. The anomalous temperature variation of PL spectra has been attributed to the carrier localization 
effect resulted from the presence of Sb clusters at the QW interfaces. The parameters that describe the tempe-
rature dependence of the interband transition energies are evaluated and discussed.

1 Introduction 
Highly strained InGaAs/GaAs quantum wells (QWs) have the advantages of simple structure, well de-
veloped technique and good optical properties among the efforts of extending the emission wavelength 
of GaAs based materials system to 1.3 µm for application as light sources in wide area networks. Ryu 
et al. [1] and Salomonsson et al. [2] have reported the development of vertical cavity surface emitting 
lasers (VCSELs) operating around 1220 nm. The In content must be increased in order to extend to long 
wavelength region for optical communication applications. However, the pseudomorphic growth of 
InGaAs on GaAs is limited not only by the generation of misfit dislocations but also by a transition from 
2D to 3D growth mode at higher indium content [3]. It is possible to increase the indium content and 
therefore to extend the emission wavelength substantially (~1.3 µm) by using ternary In0.31Ga0.69As sub-
strates [4]. However, ternary substrates are difficult to grow and available only in research quality and at 
high cost. Recently, Jiang et al. reported the PL study of the optical properties of InGaAs/GaAs QWs 
grown by Sb-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [5]. The results show that the samples grown by 
Sb incorporation and Sb pre-deposition methods display high room-temperature PL intensity at extended 
long wavelength. It is both interesting and important to understand the role of Sb in the modification of 
the optical properties of InGaAs/GaAs materials system. Therefore, a study on the Sb assistance growth 
of highly strained InGaAs(Sb)/GaAs double quantum wells (DQWs) structures is warranted.

grown under a higher Sb/V ratio. As shown in Fig. 1, the PL peak position redshifted, the intensity de-
creased, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) broadened with increasing Sb/V ratio during 
MOVPE growth. The PL peak energies were determined to be 1.046, 1.04, and 1.037 eV for samples I, 
II, and III, respectively. This result implies that when the In content x is as high as 0.39 in InxGa1–xAs 
alloy, the activated Sb source is still possible to cause a partial incorporation of Sb into the crystal lattice, 
leading to a redshift of the emission wavelength. However, an additional amount of non-radiative recom-
bination centers will also be introduced as a result of Sb incorporation. These results indicate that the role 
of Sb that the Sb acts not only as a surfactant to increase the In composition but also possibly as a dopant 
during MOVPE growth. As reported earlier [5], two competitive mechanisms exist for growth under Sb 
flux: as a surfactant, Sb tends to lower the surface energy and suppress the surface diffusion, helping to 
maintain the layer-by-layer growth mode and improve the crystalline quality. On the other hand, it is also 
partly left in the crystal lattice and acts as an alloy constituent. 
 The substitutional Sb atoms would reduce the band gap as well as increase the compressive strain in 
InGaAs(Sb) alloy due to their large atomic radius. The lattice mismatch for an In0.39Ga0.61As layer grown 
on GaAs is known to be as large as 2.7%. It becomes even larger when additional Sb atoms are incorpo-
rated into the lattice. Therefore, the Sb incorporation may tend to cause surface roughing of the growth 
front and introduce more defects acting as non-radiative recombination centers in the DQWs. In the 
present study, the alloying effect of Sb may play an important role and cause a reduction of the PL effi-
ciency for InxGa1–xAs(Sb)/GaAs DQWs with x ≥ 39%. 
 Figure 2(a) and (b) show the CER and PL spectra of two Sb-containing InGaAs(Sb)/GaAs DQWs 
samples and a reference sample at 300 and 17 K, respectively. The CER spectra of the samples grown 
with Sb treatment show a slight redshift and have been attributed to the increase of equivalent In compo-
sition. The solid curves are the least-squares fits to the first-derivative Lorentzian line-shape (FDLL) 
function of the form [7, 8]

where Aj and Φj are the amplitude and phase of the line shape, Ej and Γj are the energy and broadening 
parameter of the transitions, and the value of n depends on the origin of the transitions. For the derivative 
functional form, n = 2 is appropriate for the bound states such as excitons. The obtained interband transi- 
tions are denoted as A–E corresponding to 11H, 12H, 11L, 21H, and 22H transitions, respectively. Their 
respective locations are marked by vertical arrows in Fig. 2(a) and (b). From Fig. 2(a), the CER and PL 
spectra match well at room temperature, but the peak positions of the PL spectra are lower than the fun-
damental 11H transition of CER spectra at 17 K. This phenomena can be attributed to the carrier local-
ized states in InGaAs(Sb)/GaAs DQWs and will be discussed later.

 In order to specify the obtained spectral features, we have solved the one dimensional Schrödinger 
equation for finite quantum wells based on the envelope function approximation [9] including the effects 
of strain [10]. The relevant parameters such as effective masses of electron, heavy-hole and light-hole, 
the lattice constant, hydrostatic (a) and shear (b) deformation potentials, and the elastic stiffness con-
stants C11 and C12 of the ternary material are listed in [11]. The conduction band band-offset ratio 
Qc = ∆Ec/(∆Ec + ∆Ev) was varied in the range of 0.6–0.81, as suggest by other groups [12–14]. In this 
study we have obtained the best agreement between experiments and theoretical calculations for 
Qc = 0.65, if we identify the features A–E corresponding to 11H, 12H, 11L, 21H, and 22H transitions, 
respectively. The In content was effectively increased with Sb assistance. Table 2 lists the experimental 
results and theoretical calculation for the three samples. 
 Figure 4(a) and (b) are the temperature dependent PL spectra of sample II and peak energy position of 
samples I, II, and III in the temperature range from 17 to 300 K. The PL peak energy position shifts to 
lower energy between 17 and 45 K, and then increases between 50 and 85 K. At the temperature above 
90 K, the peak position shifts again to lower energy. This S-shape phenomenon of temperature depend-
ent PL at low temperature region was also observed on dilute nitride compounds [15, 16]. The S-shape 
behaviour observed in this study has been attributed to incorporation of Sb. Figure  4(c) plots the FWHM 
of sample I, II, and III. The FWHMs of samples II and III increase between 17 and 70 K, and then 
slightly decrease between 80 K and 100 K. After 100 K the FWHMs increase with temperature. The 
anomalous behaviour of the FWHM can be explained in terms of competition between the localized and 
delocalized states [17, 18]. The large FWHM of PL spectra results from the coexistence and competition 
between the localized and delocalized states. The localized states dominate on the low temperature do-
main (<100 K) while the delocalized states dominate over the higher temperature domain. From the 
above results and analyses, we suggest that Sb has a strong tendency to form localized cluster at QWs’ 
interface rather than forming a uniform distributed quaternary compound in the well region. The segrega-
tion of Sb to the growth interface forming unevenly distributed clusters is the cause for the anomalous 
temperature dependent behaviour of the observed PL spectra. 
 Figure 5(a) and (b) are the temperature dependence of EmnH(L)(T) transitions from CER and the PL 
peak energy of samples I, II, and III. The temperature dependent PL peak position shows an S-shape at 
low temperature region (<100 K) as a result of carrier localization. The solid lines are the least-squares

Temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL), room temperature phototransmittance (PT), contactless
electroreflectance (CER) and wavelength modulated surface photovoltage spectroscopy (WMSPS) meas-
urements are utilized to study the effects of growth interruption times, combined with Sb exposure of
GaAsSb/GaAs multiple quantum wells (MQWs) structures. The PL spectra show peak location red-
shifted, luminescence intensity increased and full width at half maximum narrowed with increasing inter-
ruption time. The features originated from different regions of the samples including interband transitions
of MQWs, interfaces and GaAs are observed and identified through a detailed comparison of the obtained
spectra and theoretical calculation. The anomalous temperature dependence of PL spectra has been attrib-
uted to the carrier localization effect resulted from the presence of Sb clusters and/or fluctuations in Sb
composition at the QW interfaces. An additional feature has also been observed below the GaAs region in
Sb exposure treated samples and the probable origin of this feature has been discussed.

difficult due to incorporation of an uncommon group-V element, Sb. The atomic configuration of these 
heterostructures at the interfaces can influence the optical and electronic properties of these devices due 
to changes in the QW profile. 
 In the present study, the effects of the growth interruptions at interfaces combined with Sb exposure of 
GaAsSb/GaAs multiple quantum well (MQWs) structures have been characterized by temperature de-
pendent photoluminescence (PL), room temperature phototransmittance (PT), contactless electroreflec-
tance (CER), and wavelength modulated surface photovoltage spectroscopy (WMSPS). The PL spectra 
show red-shifted peaks with increasing intensity and narrowed full width at half maximum (FWHM) 
with increased of interruption time. The anomalous temperature dependence of PL spectra has been at-
tributed to the carrier localization effect resulting from the presence of Sb clusters or fluctuations in Sb 
composition at the QW interfaces. An additional feature has also been observed below the GaAs region 
in Sb exposure treated samples. The possible origin of the red-shifts and additional feature are discussed. 
2 Experimental 
The three GaAsSb/GaAs multiple quantum well (MQWs) samples employed in this study were grown on 
semi-insulating GaAs(100) substrates using a VG V-80MKII molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The Sb1 
source was supplied using an EPI model 175 standard crackers K cell, and the As2 source was supplied 
from a Riber VAC 500 As valve cracker. The cracker zone temperature was 1050 °C, while the bulk 
zone temperature was about 430 °C. The structure of MQWs contains a 500 nm GaAs buffer layer, five 
periods of GaAsSb 6 nm/GaAs 34 nm. The growth of GaAsSb/GaAs MQWs proceeded as follows. Dur-
ing the growth, the cell shutter of Ga was kept open as long as necessary for the growth of the intended 
thickness of individual layers, while Sb termination was provided at the well/barrier interfaces. The inter-
face exposure times were 10 and 30 s for samples II and III, respectively. In order to study the influence 
of Sb treatments, a specimen (sample I) was also grown without any interruption. The samples were 
terminated with a 100 nm-thick GaAs cap layer and all the layers were unintentionally doped. The 
growth conditions of these three samples were identical except for the Sb exposure times. The antimony 
composition in the GaAsSb layers was determined to be 0.18, 0.20 and 0.21 for samples I, II and III, 
respectively, by double crystal X-ray diffraction (DXRD) measurements. 
 PL excitation was produced by a 20 mW, 532 nm Nd-YAG green laser. Luminescence was analyzed 
with a 0.35 m grating spectrometer and detected by an InGaAs detector using conventional lock-in detec-
tion. A CTI model 22 closed-cycle cryogenic refrigeration system equipped with a model 32B digital 
temperature controller was used for temperature dependent measurements. The measurements were made 
between 10 and 300 K with a temperature stability of 0.5 K or better. PT measurement was achieved 
using an internally modulated 5 mW laser diode (670 nm) as the modulating source. The laser intensity 
was reduced to about 1–10% of its initial value by using a neutral density filter. The probe beam was 
incident through the front surface of the sample. A 150 W tungsten-halogen lamp filtered by a PTI 
0.25 m monochromator provided the monochromatic light. The transmitted light was detected by an 
InGaAs photodetector placed behind the sample, and the signal was recorded by a lock-in amplifier. The 
dc output of the photodetector was maintained constant by a servo mechanism of variable neutral density 
filter. For CER, an ac modulating voltage (~1 kV at 200 Hz) was applied between a front wire grid elec-
trode and a second electrode consisting of a metal plate [13]. These two electrodes were separated by an 
insulating spacing which provided a very thin layer (0.1 mm) of air between the front surface of the sam-
ple and the front electrode. The configuration is nondestructive as there is no direct contact with the front 
surface of the sample. The reflected light was detected by a silicon photodiode detector and an InGaAs 
photodetector for the visible and near infrared region, respectively. For WMSPS, the derivative-like 
surface photovoltage was measured between the sample and a reference metal grid electrode in a capaci-
tive manner as a function of the photon energy of the probe beam with a wavelength-modulation tech-
nique. The illumination system consisted of a 150 W quartz-halogen lamp and a grating monochromator 
equipped with a vibrating exit slit operated by a power amplifier, employing a 2 inch loudspeaker as the 
transducer. A beam splitter was placed in the path of the incident light. The intensity of this radiation

 Figure 4 shows the schematic diagram of the band edges vs. growth direction for a compressively 
strained GaAsSb/GaAs MQWs strucutre. In contrast to the type-I semiconductor system, spatially sepa-
rated electrons and holes are easily realized in such a type-II system, in which electrons are confined in 
the GaAs layer and holes are localized in the GaAsSb layer [11]. The indirect transitions due to the spa-
tially separated electrons and holes are restricted in a very narrow region near the interfaces.

nism involved. PT is a form of electromodulation spectroscopy where the modulation of the electric field 
in the sample is caused by the photo-excited electron–hole pairs created by the laser diode. In type-II 
alignment, the positive charges of the holes are confined in the well region and the electrons experience 
electrostatic attraction toward the well region, it is difficult to achieve electric field modulation effec-
tively in such an indirect transition configuration. Therefore PT becomes less sensitive comparing to 
WMSPS in the study of type-II structures. The origin of feature C has been assigned as the first electron 
state to a light-hole transition and will be discussed in the following section. 
 Dumitras and Riechert have reported observing a feature located at 78 meV above the PL peak in the 
derivative SPV spectrum of a type-II GaAs/GaAs0.7Sb0.3/GaAs single quantum well [24]. The origin of 
this feature was identified as related to transitions between the QW-localized hole state and the extended 
electron states. By comparing the energy difference of their observed features with that of our observa-
tion and the fact that the present samples have lower Sb contents, we can tentatively rule out the assign-
ment for the presently observed feature. In order to specify the observed spectral features, we have calcu-
lated the confined energy levels in both the conduction and valence bands by assuming abrupt interfaces. 
We have solved a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for five finite square quantum wells based on 
the envelope function approximation [25] including the effects of strain [26]. A value of unstrained va- 
lance band band-offset QV
0 = 0.85 was used in the calculation [27]. We have used a number of relevant 
parameters of GaAs1–xSbx listed in [11]. The effective masses of electron, heavy- and light-hole, the lat-
tice constant, hydrostatic (a) and shear (b) deformation potentials, and the elastic stiffness constants C11 
and C12 of the ternary material were obtained by linear interpolation of values of the end-point semicon-
ductors GaAs and GaSb [28]. The calculated results are listed in Table 1. A reasonable agreement be-
tween experiments and theoretical calculations can be achieved if we identify the features A, B and C to 
be 11H, 12H and 11L, respectively. It is noted that the separation between 11H and 12H transitions de-
termined from PT/WMSPS reduces as the Sb exposure time increases. This is different from the theo-
retical prediction that as the Sb content increases the separation should become slightly larger. Our ob-
servation to the contrary might be due to the intermixing effect at the interfaces and results in a change of 
the shape of QW profiles and modifies transition energies. 
 Figure 7 shows CER spectra of the samples in the region of 1.3–1.55 eV. The CER spectra exhibit 
Franz–Keldysh oscillations (FKOs) above the band edge of GaAs. The period of the FKOs is a direct 
measure of the built-in electric field at the interface of GaAsSb/GaAs [20, 21]. The built-in electric field 
at the GaAsSb/GaAs interfaces increased with the interruption time. An additional feature located below 
GaAs band edge, denoted as X, is observed on the samples under Sb exposure treatment. The probable 
origin of this feature will be discussed in the following section. 
 Figure 8 depicts the DC optical bias dependent CER spectra of sample III in the vicinity of GaAs 
region with an additional steady-state illumination of 670 nm laser diode as an optical bias. From the

states are completely occupied, the transition between the valence band of the GaAs barrier and the inter-
face states is prohibited, resulting in the disappearance of the feature in the optical-biased CER spectra. 
However the origin of this feature warrants further verification and more studies are required. 
4 Summary 
In summary we report a temperature dependent PL and room-temperature modulation spectroscopy study 
on GaAsSb/GaAs MQWs with different interface treatments. The results indicate that Sb exposure 
growth interruptions change significantly the states of the interfaces and thus can influence the optical 
response. The anomalous temperature dependent PL spectra has been attributed to the carrier localization 
effect resulting from the presence of Sb clusters and/or Sb content fluctuations at the QW interfaces. 
Red-shifts of the interband related features and a broader lineshape of the fundamental transition are 
observed with increasing interface exposure time. The results may be due to an increase of the Sb content 
and intermixing of Sb at the GaAs interface layers in the samples. An additional feature has also been 
observed below the GaAs band energy region in Sb exposure treated samples and the physical origin of 
the feature is tentatively attributed to the transition between the valence band of the GaAs barrier and the 
localized interface states due to the presence of Sb.

Abstract
A detailed optical characterization of a Bridgman-grown wurtzite- (WZ-)
type Be0.075Cd0.925Se mixed crystal and three zinc-blende (ZB) Bex Cd1−x Se
epilayers grown by MBE on InP substrates has been carried out via
photoluminescence (PL) and contactless electroreflectance (CER) in the
temperature range of 15–400 K. The PL spectrum of the WZ-BeCdSe at
low temperature consists of an exciton line, an edge emission feature due
to recombination of donor–acceptor pairs, and a broad band related to
recombination through deep-level defects, while the PL emission peaks of the
ZB-BeCdSe epilayers show an asymmetric shape with a tail on the low-energy
side. Various interband transitions, originating from the band edge and spin–
orbit splitting critical points, of the samples have been observed in the CER
spectra. The peak positions of the exciton emission lines in the PL spectra
correspond quite well to the energies of the fundamental transitions determined
from electromodulation data. The parameters that describe the temperature
dependence of the fundamental and spin split-off bandgaps and the broadening
function of the band-edge exciton are evaluated and discussed.

Wide bandgap II–VI compounds are currently under investigation because of their possible
applications in optoelectronic devices [1]. The applications include the use of II–VI compound
based materials as light sources, in full colour displays and for increasing the information

a Hamamatsu photomultiplier tube. In CER an ac modulating voltage (∼1 kV at 200 Hz)
is applied between a front wire grid electrode and a second electrode consisting of a metal
plate. These two electrodes are separated by an insulating spacer in such a manner that there
is a very thin layer (∼0.1 mm) of air (or vacuum) between the front surface of the sample
and the front electrode. Thus, there is no direct contact with the front surface of the sample.
The probe beam enters through the front wire grid. The radiation from a 150 W xenon arc
lamp filtered by a 0.25 m monochromator provided the monochromatic light. The reflected
light was detected by an UV-enhanced silicon photodiode. The dc output of this silicon
photodiode was maintained constant by a servo mechanism of a variable neutral density filter.
A dual-phase lock-in amplifier was used to measure the detected signals. For temperature
dependent measurements, an RMC model 22 closed-cycle cryogenic refrigerator equipped
with a digital thermometer controller was used for the low-temperature measurements. For
the high-temperature experiments, each sample was mounted on one side of a copper finger of
an electrical heater, which enabled one to control and stabilize the sample temperature. The
temperature-dependent measurements were made between 15 and 400 K with the temperature
stability of 0.5 K or better.
3. Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the PL spectra of a WZ-Be0.075Ce0.925Se mixed crystal (sample I) between 15
and 300 K. At 15 K, the PL spectrum consists of a sharp peak followed by a broader emission
feature at an energy of about 95 meV lower than the first peak and a broad band in the energy
range 1.5–1.7 eV. The broad band has been attributed to recombination through deep level
defects [11]. As shown in figure 1 the first peak shifts monotonically towards lower energy
with a broadened line shape character with increasing temperature in the range from 15 to
300 K, while the second feature is completely thermally quenched at temperature higher than
100 K. To examine the origin of these two near-band-edge luminescence features, the excitation
intensity dependent PL measurements were carried out at 15 K. A linear dependence with a
slope near unity was obtained for the first peak and no shift of the emission energy as a function
of the excitation laser density was observed. The results indicate that this luminescence line
is dominated by excitonic radiative recombination and denoted as X. In contrast, the second

The CER spectrum of sample I, figure 4(a), at 15 K shows three distinct features as
indicated by the vertical arrows. Their transition energies are determined to be 1.965 ± 0.003,
2.087 ± 0.003, and 2.398 ± 0.005 eV, respectively. As the temperature increases, the CER
spectral features shift towards lower energies and broaden. The features on the lower-energy
side are not clearly resolved at higher temperature. Nevertheless, lineshape fit reveals that
two features are required to well describe the broadened structure at higher temperature. The
fitted values of the transition energies at 300 K are 1.870 ± 0.004, 2.001 ± 0.004, and
2.305 ± 0.006 eV, respectively. The obtained values of the lowest transition feature at 1.965 eV
(15 K) and 1.870 eV (300 K) agree quite well with the PL results of the band-edge exciton at
1.961 eV (15 K) and 1.865 eV (300 K). The value of 1.870 eV at 300 K also corresponds well to
the transition energy of exciton A at 1.865 eV, as determined by Wronkowska et al [15] from the
spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements performed at room temperature. They also reported
the energy of exciton C to be 2.304 eV, which is nearly identical to the position of the highest
energy feature for sample I. The work of Wronkowska et al [15] gives the energy separation
of excitons A and C as 439 meV, which agrees well with the energy difference of 435 meV as
evaluated from the present CER measurements for the lowest and the highest energy features.
We can therefore assign the lowest energy feature to be exciton A and the highest energy feature
to be exciton C. If we now turn our attention to the feature at 2.001 eV (300 K), denoted as
Y, we find that the energy separation between this second feature and exciton A is ∼131 meV
and is much larger than the room temperature energy difference between excitons A and B,
∼40 meV for WZ-CdSe [16]. Therefore, the assignment of the feature at 2.001 eV (300 K)

towards lower energies and broaden. The rate of temperature redshift of feature a (shown as
a dotted line in figure 4(b) for a guide to the eye) has been observed to be slower than the
other four features as the temperature increases. This might indicate the origin of feature a to
be different from other features and it is assigned as a defect-related transition. The origins
of features b–e will be discussed as follows. The sharp doublet features b and c are quite
similar to those of the excitonic transitions in ZnCdBeSe/InP examined by Hsieh et al [17].
The appearance of the doublets has been shown to be an indication of the heavy-hole (hh) and
light-hole (lh) related excitonic transitions due to the existence of residual strain. As shown in
table 1, the energy separations of features b and c decrease with the increase of Be content.
This result might indicate that the residual strain of Bex Cd1−x Se/InP films decreases as the Be
content increases from 0.09 to 0.20. It agrees quite well with the x-ray results [9]. At room
temperature, the lattice mismatches are 1.76%, 0.92% and 0.01% for samples II, III and IV,
respectively. The doublet features b and c are not clearly resolved at temperature higher than
150 K. Therefore, we fit the CER spectra with only three features for temperatures higher than
150 K. The origin of feature d is assigned as an interband transition of the ZnCdSe interfacial
layer based on the similar energy position of the feature to the direct bandgap result of the
previous CER study on Zn0.56Cd0.44Se/InP by Malikova et al [18]. The energy separation of
features b and e is evaluated to be ∼430 meV and is quite similar but slightly larger than the
spin–orbital splitting 0 = 410 meV for cubic CdSe determined by spectroscopic ellipsometry
measurements at room temperature [19]. We can therefore assign features b and e to be the
band edge E0 and its spin split-off E0 + 0 transitions, respectively, for samples II, III and IV.

where E(0) is the transition energy at T = 0 K, aB represents the strength of the electron
(exciton)–average phonon interaction, and B corresponds to the average phonon temperature.
Shown by the dotted lines in figure 5 is a least-squares fit to equation (3). The obtained values
for the various parameters are also given in table 2. For comparison purposes, the parameters
for the near-band-edge transition energies of WZ-CdSe [16], CdBeSe/ZnCdMgSe (SQW) [21],
ZB-ZnSe [18], and ZB-Zn0.56Cd0.44Se [18] are also listed in table 2.
The parameter α of equation (2) can be related to aB and B in equation (3) by taking
the high-temperature limit of both expressions. This yields α = 2aB/B. Comparison of the
numbers presented in table 2 shows that this relation is indeed satisfied. From equation (3), it
is straightforward to show that the high temperature limit of the slope of the E(T ) versus T
curve approaches a value of −2aB/B. The calculated value of −2aB/B for the band-edge
exciton is equal to −0.37, −0.39, −0.42, and −0.43 meV K−1 for samples I, II, III, and IV
respectively, which agrees well with the value of [dE A(0)/dT ] = −0.42, −0.42, −0.43, and
−0.44 meV K−1 as obtained from the linear extrapolation of the high-temperature (200–400 K)
CER experimental data.

the temperature range of 15 K  T  400 K. PL spectra at low temperatures consist of
a sharp exciton line and broader features related to defects. The sharp band-edge excitonic
feature in the PL spectra shows a blue-shift in the transition energy with the increase in Be
content. Various interband transitions, originating from the band edge and spin–orbit splitting
critical points, of the samples have been observed in the CER spectra. The peak positions
of the exciton emission lines in the PL spectra correspond quite well to the energies of the
fundamental transitions determined from electromodulation data. The temperature dependence
of the fundamental and spin split-off bandgaps has been analysed by both Varshni- and Bose–
Einstein-type expressions. The parameters extracted from both expressions by extending into
the high-temperature regime are found to agree reasonably well. The parameters that describe
the temperature dependence of the broadening function of the band-edge exciton have also
been studied. The values of (0) for the Be-containing single-crystal sample are much larger
than those of Be-containing thin-film samples. Actually, it is not easy to grow high-quality
Be-containing II–VI single-crystal samples. The larger values of LO and LO are related to
the higher effective longitudinal-optical-phonon energy of the Be-containing samples.

and Cd0.4Zn0.4Be0.2Se and a bulk ZnSe material. Evidently,
both the CL intensities of Cd0.4Zn0.45Be0.15Se and
Cd0.4Zn0.4Be0.2Se crystals decline faster than that of ZnSe. It
is interesting that the CL intensities of the other three crystals
x=0.03 y=0.03, x=0.1 y=0.1, and x=0.3 y=0.1 remain
constant with the progressive exposure of electron beam. The
intensity of Cd0.94Zn0.03Be0.03Se crystal even increases
slightly. The exact mechanism is unknown but might refer to
the annealing effect. We have performed the experiments
with different electron energies 5–30 keV and probe cur-
rents 8–20 nA. The results also show the similar behav-
iors. In our studied samples, even though both of the zinc
and beryllium contents are changed in these crystals, the
trend of the degradation is not influenced by the change of
zinc composition. For example, one can see that the degra-
dation of Cd0.8Zn0.1Be0.1Se and Cd0.6Zn0.3Be0.1Se crystals al-
most follows the same curve, as shown in Fig. 2. We can
clearly reach the conclusion that the composition of beryl-
lium plays a dominant role for the degradation. The under-
lying mechanism is believed to be due to the intense covalent
and shorter bonds of beryllium, which bring the crucial con-
tribution in hardening the lattice structure of II-VI com-
pounds. According to the above results, we point out that to
improve the degradation problem, the beryllium composition
in CdZnSe alloys should be less than 10%. This result is in

Quite interestingly, the CL images taken at different ex-
posure times can be used to reveal the behavior of defects as
predicted by the recombination enhanced defect model. The
panchromatic CL images of Fig. 3 show the successive
stages of the degradation of Cd0.4Zn0.4Be0.2Se crystal. In Fig.
3a, we can see several dark lines. There is also a faint dark
spot on the underside. Those arise from the preexisting de-
fects in the crystal, where the nonradiative recombination
occurs. The dark lines and spot become thicker and darker in
the successive stages. In the subsequent stage of Fig. 3b,
two new dark spots appear just above the first dark one. The
two dark spots become larger and darker in the successive
stages of Figs. 3c and 3d. In addition, the luminescence
intensity of whole exposure area is quenched with exposure
time. This is in good agreement with the described behavior
according to the recombination-enhanced defect motion, in
which the energy released by a defect can locally enhance
the mobility of the defect and generate new defects near the
preexisting ones. It also demonstrates that CL image is a
powerful tool to probe the defect generation of an optoelec-
tronic material under external perturbation.

I. INTRODUCTION
Self-assembled quantum dots QDs offer nearly ideal
zero-dimensional semiconductor systems and have hence at-
tracted considerable contemporary attention for the study of
potential device applications and physics.1 The most com-
monly studied self-assembled system comprises InAs dots
embedded in GaAs matrix. The fractional area occupancy of
the dots is small for this system, resulting in relatively low
values for quantities such as laser modal gain2,3 and the nor-
mal incidence absorption.4 Since these quantities scale ap-
proximately linearly with the dot number, their values can be
increased by using an array of vertically coupled quantum
dots VCQDs.5–7 The most significant advantage comes
from the enhancement of the QD density in the laser active
region, which has direct consequence in reducing the thresh-
old current.8 Furthermore, the strain field from underlying
dots induces vertical alignment in closely stacked QD layers,
leading to a reduction of the dot size distribution.9 A further
peculiarity of multiple QDs consists of the electronic cou-
pling between dots of adjacent layers for a stack when the
spacer layer SL thickness is thin enough to allow carrier
tunneling. This gives rise to strong modifications of QD op-
tical properties and radiative recombination rate.10
Although it is possible to grow VCQD samples with
many dot layers, a complication arises in that the structural
and electronic properties of InAs dots are found to be corre-
lated closely with GaAs thickness deposited between adja-
cent dot layers. A thorough understanding of the structural
and electronic couplings between dot layers and an ability of
controlling the dot size and distribution is very important for
device design and optimization. For example, laser structures
require both that the dot layers be placed close to the maxi-
mum of the transverse mode, and should be grown as close
together as possible, and that the dot distribution in different
layers must be reasonably uniform so as to ensure a narrow
spectral gain.
Optical properties of InAs/GaAs VCQD structures have
already been studied in detail mainly through photo-
luminescence11–13 PL and photoluminescence excitation
PLE measurements.14,15 PL detects optical transitions in
these structures by recording the radiative recombination
processes. However, not all recombination processes in VC-
QDs are radiative; in such cases PL spectroscopy is unable to
provide a complete picture of the system. PLE is an efficient
technique, but it requires the use of a tunable laser and its
implementation can be laborious. The surface photovoltage
spectroscopy SPS has been shown to be a complementary
technique to PL, because it gives information about the elec-
trons and holes created by illumination, which do not recom-aElectronic mail: ysh@et.ntust.edu.twSurface photovoltage spectroscopy a

Similar to the observation from PL spectra, the transition
energies of QD ground state and excited states are almost
unchanged when comparing spectra for the reference sample
and the 30 nm SL sample. From the theoretical consider-
ation, it is expected that well-confined states would have
little electronic and structural couplings for SL width of
30 nm. Evidence can be seen in the cross-sectional TEM of
Fig. 4, where each layer exhibits the property essentially the
same as that of a single layer, with the positions of dots in
subsequent layers exhibiting no correlation. A noticeable dif-
ference between these two samples is that the broadening
parameters of the QD related features for the 30 nm SL
sample are larger than those for the reference sample. Also
noted in Fig. 3, the most prominent QD1 related to the fun-
damental transition for the SL=30 nm sample is remarkably
larger in intensity than the corresponding one for the refer-
ence sample. Energy level variations in the ensemble of QDs
are primarily caused by size changes in the stacked layers.
As shown in Fig. 3, the strength of the SPS signal related
to the fundamental transition increases when the SL thick-
ness is reduced. The possible reason will be discussed as
follow. As shown in the literature,17–19 the SPS spectrum is
determined by the following two factors: 1 the optical ab-
sorption in QDs, and 2 the escape of carriers from QDs and
their separation in the electric field. In the present case, al-
though the change of dot density and QD shape would influ-
ence the absorption strength, the major contribution on SPS
is deduced to be from the second factor for reasons stated
below. The TEM images of thinner SL samples reveal similar
dot density and a minor increase of dot size, which is unable
to explain such an intensity variation. The expected tunnel-
ing of carriers between QDs in adjacent layers for a stack
should, in principle, enhance for any reduction in SL thick-
ness and hence have higher probability for carriers to escape
from QDs. The ensuing carrier transport facilitated by the
coupling of QDs results in a larger SPS intensity for thinner
SL.
An additional structure labeled QDA at energy higher
above QD3 was detected for SL thickness thinner than

064301-5 Chan et al. J. Appl. Phys. 100, 064301 2006dots leads to a blueshift due to the increment of band gap
energy. It means that the large strain field may serve as a
driving force for substantial intermixing between InAs/GaAs
in the dots. The effect is most pronounced by increasing
deposited layers of QDs with smaller SL width in our case
SL=10, 15 nm.
As mentioned above in the PL spectra, a peculiar spec-
tral feature QDX occurring at energy below QD1 for VCQD
structures with SL=10 and 15 nm, and it is noted for sample
with SL=10 nm the intensity of QDX is comparable with
that of QD1, but in other SPS spectra the intensity of QDX is
obviously weaker than that of QD1. In order to have a better
understanding of the physical properties of QDX, tempera-
ture dependent PL experiments are carried out. As shown in
Fig. 6, there exists a competitive relationship between QD1
and QDX for the 10 nm SL sample. The integrated PL inten-
sity of QDX begins to grow dramatically with increasing
temperature while that of QD1 shows the opposite. This be-
havior can be explained by the tendency of enhanced thermal
escape of carriers from higher-energy QD ensemble and/or
tunneling of carriers between QDs in adjacent layers for a
stack due to a reduction in SL thickness. A decrease of QD1
strength with increasing temperatures arises from thermal
emission of carriers. At low temperature carriers captured by
a dot in a given column are predicted to migrate along the
column and become localized in the dot with the lowest
ground state transition energy before recombining radia-
tively. At temperature above 200 K, more scattering channels
open up resulting in a somewhat faster rise of the linewidth
of QD1 up to room temperature. The thermal excitation of
optical phonons enhances exciton scattering, suggesting that
not only single phonon absorption is important but also mul-
tiphonon processes contribute to exciton scattering so that
states lying more than one longitudinal-optical LO phonon

at which the phonon population is considerably increased.
Once the higher lying states are occupied, it is most likely
for electrons to thermally activate outside dot columns into
wetting layer and/or the GaAs barrier and then capture by
other uncoupled dots. Another probable process need to be
included is the enhancement of the tunneling of carriers be-
tween QDs in adjacent layers for a stack for a thinner SL.
This enhancement of tunneling may also support a higher
intensity of SPS signal for a similar dot density in QD stacks.
As shown in Table I, the blueshift of QD1 for the sample
with SL=10 nm is most pronounced compared to samples
with a larger SL width. It makes easier for electrons to es-
cape away from the columns and then relax into those un-
coupled dots, giving rise to the conspicuous QDX feature for
SL=10 nm in the room-temperature PL spectrum.
IV. SUMMARY
SPS and PL techniques have been used to characterize
the self-assembled InAs/GaAs QD structures with varying
GaAs SL thickness. Signals have been observed from all the
relevant portions of the samples including the QDs, WL, and
the GaAs barrier. The SPS spectra for VCQD structures with
thinner SL compared with other structures show an addi-
tional feature lying above the second excited QD state due to
the modified band structure caused by the strain-induced
field. The accurate location of the transition energy can be
determined from a Gaussian line shape fit. The spectra are
observed to be blueshifted with decreasing SL thickness, in-
dicating that the material intermixing is strongly driven by
the strain. A peculiar spectral feature QDX below the funda-
mental transition is tentatively attributed to optical absorp-
tion from the uncoupled dots. The intensity ratio between the
ground state and QDX in the temperature dependent PL ex-
periment is found to be associated with the processes of en-
hanced thermal carrier transfer between QDs and tunneling
of carriers between QDs in adjacent layers for a stack due to
a reduction in SL thickness. This work demonstrates the con-
siderable diagnostic value of surface photovoltage spectros-
copy for the nondestructive characterization of vertically
coupled self-assembled quantum dot structures.
