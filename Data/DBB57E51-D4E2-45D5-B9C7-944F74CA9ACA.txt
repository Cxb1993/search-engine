Abstract—This research utilizes a simplified type-2 fuzzy 
system to a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) for target following 
control. A CCD camera and ultrasonic sensors are integrated 
in the control scheme. The wheeled mobile robot can adjust 
moving path by the position and heading angle, which are 
given from the camera. Dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy is 
implemented in fuzzy rules. Distance between the WMR and 
an obstacle, center coordinate, heading angle, and 
displacement of the obstacle can all be obtained by image 
process and distance computation algorithm. Experiments 
show that the WMR can perform dynamic obstacle avoidance 
and follow moving object successfully.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Wheeled mobile robots have been widely used in the 
present. The focus of its development is on how to make it 
effectively and quickly work in various environments.  Many 
researches of intelligent robots have been applied to home 
services, health care, space exploration, military, 
entertainment [1]-[3], etc. As an intelligent system, the 
WMR integrates many functions such as environment 
sensing, dynamic decision-making and planning, behavior 
controlling and executing, etc. In previous studies, most of 
the wheeled mobile robot used sensors to perform assigned 
tasks. In this paper, the proposed autonomous wheeled 
mobile robot uses image recognition and distance 
determination for target tracking and obstacle avoidance. 
There are three intelligent controller designs in this paper, 
they are tracking trajectory, following the navigator, and 
avoiding obstacle. In recent years, the use of fuzzy logic 
controller to perform mobile robot control has become a 
popular method [4]. The fuzzy system can also be called the 
fuzzy logic control, the fuzzy expert system, fuzzy 
association memory or fuzzy model, etc. Fuzzy theory has 
been widely applied to the design of controller because of the 
following reasons: 1) Control rules are more flexible, it can 
simplify the complex system; 2) The controller can emulate 
the human decision making; 3) It does not need detail model 
of the plant, it replaces the mathematical values in describing 
control system by using the lingual ambiguous expression 
variables. 
The fuzzy logic controller is credited with being an 
adequate methodology for designing robust controllers that 
are able to deliver a satisfactory performance in face of 
uncertainty and imprecision. In this paper, type-2 fuzzy and 
type-1 fuzzy are applied to speed control and the angle 
control [5]. Fuzzy logic theory and image processing are 
used to construct an intelligent control scheme for the WMR 
to recognize and track a moving object automatically. The 
distance and target’s position are inputs of the proposed 
fuzzy controller and the outputs are the speed control value, 
angle control value and acceleration of the wheeled mobile 
robot. The Ihomer of the MSI is used in the entity tests [6]. 
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
The proposed control scheme is implemented on the 
Ihomer WMR, as shown in Fig. 1. The WMR is 330 mm in 
length and 380 mm in width, and the height is 255 mm. The 
Ihomer is a two-wheel differentially driven car-like robot. It 
has 6 ultrasonic sensors installed, which are used for 
obstacle detection, obstacle avoidance, feature recognition 
and location etc. In this study, a CCD camera PZ6114/6124 
[7] is put on top of the WMR, which can provide images of 
the objects.

A.  Image process 
The range of visual light’s wavelength is about 400 to 
700 nm. A color model is an abstract mathematical model 
describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of 
numbers, typically as three or four values of color 
components. The primary colors of pigment can create a 
wide range of colors. The pigments are magenta, cyan, 
yellow, and black. There are many possible color spaces by

the camera to the floor and b represents the distance from 
the projection point of the camera on the floor to the closest 
view point. Lx is the largest length of width that camera can 
see as shown in Fig. 4. Lx is the length from the left to the 
right of the view. Ly is the largest range that camera can see,

The u and v are the horizontal pixel and the vertical pixel of 
center coordinates of the target. The H and W represent the 
pixel lengths of an image which are provided by the CCD 
camera. We can obtain the center coordinates (X, Y) of the 
target after the image processing [11]. 
III. CONTROL SCHEME 
The differences between type-1 and type-2 fuzzy system 
are the membership functions and output procedures. The 
type-2 fuzzy set uses type-2 fuzzy membership functions 
and output process, where the output process has two parts; 
the type-reduction and defuzzification. The type-2 fuzzy 
logic system is a combination of fuzzy rule base to provide 
the second set of inference output.  The inference is similar 
to the type-1 fuzzy system, it is handled by the output of 
simplified procedures for operation and is transformed to 
the type-1 fuzzy sets, then the crisp output can be obtained 
by defuzzification. Since the type-2 fuzzy logic system can 
carry uncertainty information in its membership function, so 
operation is much more complex and is inconvenience in the 
application. This study utilizes a simplified fuzzy logic 
controller, called the simplified interval type-2 fuzzy 
controller to the WMR control. The simplified interval type-
2 fuzzy system is obtained by splitting the type-2 fuzzy 
system into two type-1 systems. This will save a lot of 
complicated computation processes. Interval type-2 fuzzy 
sets can be split into two single membership functions of the 
type-1 fuzzy sets. Their membership functions can be 
considered as the left and right fuzzy controllers. The 
averaged output will be the output of the proposed fuzzy 
controller. 
Suppose the interval type-2 fuzzy system has M rules. 
Each rule can be described as follow: 
 Ri: IF xi is Ai and x2 is Bi THEN y is Gi 
where i=1, 2, …, M, Ai and Bi are the antecedent fuzzy sets 
of the second type, while Gi is the consequent fuzzy set of 
the second type. Assuming the case of rule l, 1x  and 2x  are 
the inputs to trigger each rule of interval type-2 fuzzy sets Al 
and Bl of antecedent. Take the product of upper membership 
functions (UMF) 1( )lA x  and 2( )lB x , the antecedent 
membership function output of lf  can be found. Take the 
product of down membership functions (DMF) 1( )lA x  and 
2( )lB x , the antecedent membership function output of lf  
can be obtained. Consequent output ( )lB y   of  rules lR  is

The positions of the moving target in the image 
coordinates of the WMR are shown in Fig. 8. Pixel position 
at 175 is the center of the image coordinates of the CCD 
camera. The camera keeps tracking the target and makes the 
image of the target on the center of the camera frame. 
Turning angles of the WMR by different types of fuzzy 
controllers are shown in Fig. 9. Moving speeds of the WMR 
are shown in Fig. 10. At midway, the target stops for 15 
seconds. Experimental results show that the simplified 
interval type-2 fuzzy controller has smoothing speed and 
turning angle than the type-1 fuzzy controller. With image 
processing techniques the proposed fuzzy controllers can 
control the WMR for target following and obstacle 
avoidance.

cruise altitude to an altitude of approximately 1200 ft above 
the ground. The pilot then positions the aircraft so that the 
aircraft is on a heading towards the runway centerline. When 
the aircraft approaches the outer airport marker, which is 
about 4 nautical miles from the runway, the glide path signal 
is intercepted, as shown in Fig. 1. As the airplane descends 
along the glide path, its pitch, attitude, and speed must be 
controlled. The descent rate is about 10 ft/sec and the pitch 
angle is between -5 to +5 degrees. Finally, as the airplane 
descends 20 to 70 feet above the ground, the glide path 
control system is disengaged and a flare maneuver is 
executed. The vertical descent rate is decreased to 2 ft/sec so 
that the landing gear may be able to dissipate the energy of the 
impact at landing. The pitch angle of the airplane is then 
adjusted, between 0 to 5 degrees for most aircraft, which 
allows a soft touchdown on the runway surface. 
A simplified model of a commercial aircraft that moves 
only in the longitudinal and vertical plane is used in the 
simulations for implementation ease [7]. The motion 
equations of the aircraft are given as follows:

(ft/sec), oγ  is the flight path angle (-3deg), and g  is the 
gravity  (32.2 ft/sec2). The parameters ii ZX , and iM  are the 
stability and control derivatives. To make the ALS more 
intelligent, reliable wind profiles are necessary. Two spectral 
turbulence forms models by von Karman and Dryden are 
mostly used for aircraft response studies. In this study the 
Dryden form [7] was used for its demonstration ease.  
III. CONTROL SCHEME 
The inputs of PID controller consist of altitude and altitude 
rate commands along with aircraft altitude and altitude rate. 
Via aircraft landing controller we can obtain the pitch 
command. Then, the pitch autopilot is controlled by pitch 
command. Detail descriptions can be found in [7]. In general, 
the PID controller is simple and effective but there are some 
drawbacks such as apparent overshoot and sensitive to 
external noise and disturbance. When severe turbulence is 
encountered the PID controller may not be able to guide the 
aircraft to land safely. With CMAC compensator the 
proposed controller can overcome these disadvantages [12]. It 
uses a traditional PID controller to stabilize the system and 
train the CMAC to provide precise control. The gains of PID 
controller are adjusted based on experiences, what it provides 
are tolerable solutions, not desired solutions. The CMAC can 
effectively meliorate these conditions. 
The overall control scheme is described in Fig. 2, in which 
the control signal U is the sum of the PID controller output 
and the fuzzy CMAC output. The inputs for the fuzzy CMAC 
and PID controller are: altitude, altitude command, altitude 
rate, and altitude rate command. The PID controller provides 
tolerable solutions. In each time step k, the fuzzy CMAC 
involves a recall process and a learning process. In the recall 
process, it uses the desired system output of the next time step 
and the actual system output as the address to generate the 
control signal fuzzyCMACU . In the learning process, the control 
signal of the pitch autopilot, U, is treated as a desired output. 
It is used to modify the weights of fuzzy CMAC stored at 
location which is addressed by the actual system output and 
the system output of the next time step. The output of the 
fuzzy CMAC is the compensation for pitch command. When 
the wind turbulence is too strong, the ALS can not control the 
aircraft to land safely. In here we use fuzzy CMAC control 
scheme to improve the ability of turbulence resistance of the 
ALS.

V. CONCLUSIONS 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the use of 
intelligent control techniques in the automatic landing system, 
which includes the conventional fuzzy CMAC and the fuzzy 
CMAC with adaptive learning rule. Tracking performance 
and environment adaptive capability are demonstrated 
through software simulations. The type-2 fuzzy CMAC has 
better disturbance adaptive capability than conventional PID 
type controller and type-1 fuzzy CMAC. It can tolerate the 
turbulence strength to 130 ft/sec. The performance of the 
adaptive type-2 fuzzy CMAC is more robust than type-2 
fuzzy CMAC. The adaptive type-2 fuzzy CMAC can guide 
the aircraft safely under the turbulence strength up to 165 
ft/sec. Stability of the proposed control system is guaranteed 
by using gradient descent method and the Lyapunov theory.
