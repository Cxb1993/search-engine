簡介 
我們所關心的問題是如何在微小流道(血管)裡捕捉
具有磁性的目標粒子。假想大約是 10 微米到 100 奈米大
小的磁性粒子均勻地分佈在水性溶液中，在方型或圓型
的微小流道中流動，那麼要如何把這些磁性粒子聚集起
來？直覺上可利用棒狀磁鐵將磁性粒子吸起，但是流道
是封閉的，所以像日常生活中磁鐵吸鐵粉一樣把磁性粒
子吸附在磁鐵表面擷取出來是不可行的。就算退而求其
次利用磁棒創造出一個磁場試圖讓磁性粒子吸附在微小
流道內層的表面，但流道的直徑大約在 1mm 左右，一般
用的磁鐵大小大約是公分等級，在我們所關心的尺度之
下磁鐵的表現並不如直覺所預期般的有效。而且在這樣
的情況之下它並不是等向性的(isotropic)，但我們期望它
是。到了這裡，我們所關心的問題有了具體畫面：均勻
混合了磁性粒子的水性溶液充滿了微小流道，在封閉的
流道中希望將磁性粒子聚集並且加以擷取。而聚集的方
法最好是等向性的，或者至少近似等向性。我們試圖透
過磁場以間接的方式將磁性粒子限制在某個陜小的區
域，那麼這就是一個屬於電磁學範疇的問題了。以下我
們將說明處理一個電磁問題所需要的理論背景與自理論
出發到實際運算的數值方法之間的相關性。 
 
電磁學理論背景 
電磁問題必需要滿足 Maxwell’s equations，而以下
四個式子便是在真空之中的 Maxwell’s equations：

現在我們已經有電場、磁場與場源(source)的關係，
為了利於計算的便與物理念的清晰以下再引入電位能與
磁位能。靜電場中電場與電位能的關係為 VE −∇=r 。而
一般來說磁位能為向量場並且與磁場的關係為
AB
rr ×∇= ，但在穩態電流及靜磁場的空間中可定義出一
個純量磁位能 mV ，且它與磁場的關係為 mVB −∇=
r 。最後
再加上所考量例子的邊界條件後就成了一個完整且唯一
解的 PDE( Partial Differential Equation)問題。但是在不同
的例子中有不同的邊界條件，當邊界條件給定後只要去
解 Maxwell’s equations 就能夠得到我們所想要知道的磁
場與電場值。但在工程上由於解析解並不易求得，更多
時候是無法求得，所以絕大部分的時候必需要使用數值
方法去求電場與磁場。以下將引入現在較常被使用的有
限元素法(Finite Element Method, FEM)。 
FEM 最早是由 Alexander Hrennikoff 與 Richard 
Courant 所提出。原本是為了處理複雜的航空結構問題，
但後來以變分法(Calculus of Variations)為基礎所建立起
的 FEM理論具有一般性所以很快得就應用到各種結構工

以上是十張不同 y 值其 x-z 平面上的 K 值圖，明顯
地看的出所有的目標粒子都受到一堵像牆的阻力而無法
穿過環所重疊的流道區域，也就是說目標粒子會在
z=-0.25mm 之前的位置堆積。這個方式不僅可以將靜止的
目標粒子聚集在特定區域，最大的優點是在流速不快的
移動狀態也仍舊可以將其堆積。這樣的環狀結構其實可
以把它示為過濾器，如果一個環所造成的位能牆無法將
目標粒子停止下來至少能夠讓它減速，進第二個環之前
再用一樣的方法將停止、聚集。圖三為二個環的位能圖。 
 
實驗結果與討論 
以下四張圖為單環的實際例子，圖四：液體充滿流
道，外加磁場尚未啟動；圖五：開啟外加磁場至穩定；
圖六：關閉外加磁場 2 秒後；圖七：關閉外加磁場 15 秒
後。觀察以上結果可以發現，目標粒子的濃度愈高，其
區域顏色愈紅。剛開始液體充滿流道因為目標粒子均勻
分佈在流道之中，濃度相當低所以幾乎透明。開啟外加
磁場後明顯的看到進環之前的區域變成深紅色，有目標
磁性粒子堆積。放掉磁場之後侷限目標磁性粒子的位能

研究目的 
在許多過去的研究中，由於在圈數增加和頻率增加
時會造成電阻值非線性的上升，大部分要產生磁場較大
頻率較高的交流磁場都是以較少的圈數，提高電流為
主，因此要如何在固定的電壓與電流限制下提高固定空
間中磁場的頻率以及大小，就是一個比較有效可以改善
現況的方法，以期在輔助電路的限制下，得到更大的工
作範圍 (在寬度相同與磁場大小相同的情況下，如何在操
作頻率內儘可能地降低電阻值，以求在相同的電壓下產
生更大的電流或是有機會纏繞更多的線圈) 。 
 
阻抗匹配 
電磁鐵最簡單的等效電路是一顆電感，其阻抗值為
jωL，當頻率增加時阻抗值會等比例上升，通常會加上一
顆電容使阻抗只剩下實部值 
 
   (1) 
 
從(1)可以很輕易的算出特定頻率下所需要的電容值: 
 
   (2) 
 
如此便可把電磁鐵中電抗的影響消除[3]。 
 
鐵芯的形狀以及線圈在鐵芯位置上的分布 
在同一交流電流底下要產生較強的磁場，有一些部
分是可以去探討的：1- 鐵芯的形狀，2- 鐵芯截面的形狀
和面積，3- 線圈繞線的圈數，4- 線圈繞線的位置，5- 線
圈繞線的方法。在鐵芯的形狀和線圈分佈的位置這兩種
情況的結果為，線圈越靠近開口，鐵芯和磁力線為同方
向上，在開口處會有最強的磁場並且差異不大。如下圖
二(a) ~ (d)結果相差不到 5%，鐵芯上若有突起如圖二(e)，
在同樣電流下磁場值則為其他的 75%[4]。 
 
圖二：各種形狀鐵芯產磁能力的比較 
 
根據磁路的公式，圖二(c)的磁路可以表達成： 
 
Ф(L1 /µ1S1 + L2/µ2S2 )= N1I+N2I   (3) 
 
其中 L1為鐵芯總長度，L2為空氣總長度，µ1為鐵芯導磁
率，µ2為空氣導磁率，S1鐵芯截面積，S2為空氣截面積，
N1 為上鐵芯缺口上方的線圈數，N2 為鐵芯缺口下方線圈
的圈數，I 為線圈上的電流。另外 Ф為總磁通量，L1 /µ1S1
和 L2/µ2S2為等效的磁阻，N1I 和 N2I 為兩邊線圈所能產生
的磁動勢[5]。 
由(3)可知，當鐵芯導磁率超過 1000 H/m，空氣間隙
大於 10mm，鐵芯的磁阻是可以被忽略的；並且其中的磁
場值(B = Ф/S)只會與距離有關，與面積是無關的。另外
開口的表面平坦為最佳，但表面並不會顯著地影響磁場
的大小(相差不超過 10%)，截面的形狀以橢圓為最佳，正
方形次之，在實際實驗中，兩者差距不到 3%。綜合上述，
因為在鐵芯形狀、截面積、 後續組合、與製作難易度等
方面，方形的鐵芯都有較佳的表現，因而決定以方形的
鐵芯做為材料進行實驗。繞線上則以圈數越多越好，位
置越靠近開口越好來做為繞線的標準。 
 
集膚效應 
所需產生的磁場為一交流磁場，在導線內部，必須
要考慮到集膚效應的發生。集膚效應是指當導線中的電
流在較高的頻率時，內部的電流會傾向於在導線靠近表
面的地方流動(此時電子分….就稱為集膚深度)，造成有效
截面積變小，電阻值上升[5]。集膚深度 δ的計算方式為： 
 
   (4) 
 
其中 
ρ = 導體的電阻率  
ω = 交流電的角頻率 = 2π × 頻率  
μ = 導體的絕對導磁率 = μ0×μr，其中 μ0是真空導磁率，
μr是導體的相對導磁率 
 
集膚效應的解決方法為使用里茲線，使用多條較細的導
線組成一條較粗的導線，使導線在高頻下，所有的面積
仍然為有效截面積，而不會使電阻升高。 
 
圖四：集膚與鄰近效應對交流電阻的影響 
 
鄰近效應 
鄰近效應是指當導線上為交流電時，其每條的磁場
對其他條導線內電子分佈的影響，此影響會直接介由降
低電子所走的截面積來提高電阻值。方程式(1)為在截面
積為長方形的導線，直流以及交流下電阻值的差異。 
 
   (2) 
 11
測試集膚效應的效果: 
如圖七(a)所示，集膚效應對於線徑越大之導線影響
越大(使其電阻值上升之比例越高)，另外如圖七(b)所示，
線徑較大之導線雖然受集膚效應之影響較明顯，但其直
流下的電阻相對於較小線徑的導線小很多，就以在
500kHz 來說，0.6mm 一股和 0.05mm 90 股(90 條並連)的
電阻值是相差不多的。 
 
 
(a) 
 
  
(b) 
圖七：(a)一公尺長不同線徑漆包線阻抗隨頻率上升之百
分比，(b)一公尺長不同線徑漆包線阻抗隨頻率之變化。 
 
測試鄰近效應在和鐵芯接觸處隔絕的效果： 
從圖八可知，在遠離鐵芯(讓鄰近效應減小)的情況
下，線圈的電阻值變化是很可觀的。因此在之後的實驗
中線圈和鐵芯間都會隔著 2mm 的空氣。 
 
 
圖八：以 0.6mm 的一公尺長銅漆包線環繞鐵芯 10 圈，比
較與鐵芯有無隔離狀態下的電阻值隨頻率的變化 
 
 
 
圖九：寄生電容對實部及虛部的影響 
 
寄生電容影響的測試： 
在圖九中我們可以看到，當虛部出現了一個極點
時，實部也會有一個極點值出現。在出現此極點時，電
磁鐵的電阻值會高達幾十 kΩ(在此極點之後，電磁鐵會呈
現電容的特性並且無法產生任何磁場)，因為當此現象發
生的頻率在我們所操作的頻率時，電阻值會急遽的上升， 
造成電磁鐵不再適用(只要超過 50Ω幾乎可以確定鐵芯不
再適用，因為在 50Ω時電壓必須超過 50V 才能有 1A，若
再加上阻抗匹配所需電容的寄生電阻，便需要更高的電
壓才可達到相同大小的電流，此一需要高電壓與高電流
兼具的做法是很不容易實現的)。為了降低此一現象的影
響我們有兩種做法，第一種是延後極點發生的頻率，第
二種便是縮小他影響的範圍。從等效電路的方程式(9)中
我們可以看出此一極點發生的頻率，為了延後此頻率我
們必須要做出一些調整。 
 
L = Ф / I   (10) 
 
Ф (I/µS) = NI   (11) 
 
在同樣的磁場(B= Ф/S)值之下，開口面積越小 Ф越小，L
也會越小，如此便能延後極點發生的頻率。另外從電容(C)
下手，C=εS/l，導線和導線間的面積是固定的，最好的做
法為讓線和線之間間距拉大。 
  
(a)   
(b)  
 
圖十：(a)50 圈，導線間無間距，R-X 隨頻率變化，(b)50
圈分兩層，導線間距 1mm，層與層間距 2mm。 
 
從圖十可看出，拉大導線間的間距對於延後極點發生的
頻率有很大的影響。為了使其影響範圍變小，需要一種
寄生電容影響較小的繞線方式，線圈間因為導線電場產
生電子偏移的空間分佈，很明顯可以改變在極點位置電
阻值上升時影響的範圍。所以我們便採用圖十一的繞線
方法：每條線和鐵芯間角度較小，並且在上下兩端線和
線之間較緊密。如此一來，就算電流要藉由電般的方式
傳輸，因為每圈和鐵芯的角度都比傳統繞法要來得小，
因此,導線內部對電子分佈的影響會較其他條導線的影

required breakdown fields are higher for smaller cells.  
Once broken down, micro plasma discharges are generated 
inside the cells and then self extinguished because of the 
deposition of charges on the internal surfaces of each cell.  
The charged PDMS foams are flexible and highly polarized.  
Up- on the application of mechanical or electrical stresses, 
the quasi-dipoles inside PDMS electrets change their 
dimensions and dipole moments, which results in the desired 
piezoelectricity as illustrated in Fig. 1.  The application of a 
force to a PDMS electret is expected to induce additional 
charges on the top and bottom electrodes.  Overall, the 
piezoelectricity of a PDMS electret is dependent on its 
porosity, elastic modulus, cell size, and surface charge 
density. 
 
Figure 1: Schematic illustration of electret structure and 
piezoelectricity 
 
 
Figure 2: Schematic illustration of the proposed fabrication 
process 
 
Fabrication Processes 
Fig. 2 illustrates the fabrication of piezoelectric PDMS 
electrets.  A solution with semi-crystalline polymers or 
dielectric nanoparticles dispersed inside, is emulsified into 
uniformly distributing droplets with diameters about 5 μm in 
PDMS pre-polymer.  The solutes employed in our trials 
include iron oxide nanoparticles, polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA).  In some cases, 
hexane and silicone-based surfactant are dissolved in PDMS 
pre-polymer to reduce its viscosity and to stabilize the 
droplets.  Meanwhile, weight ratios of solution to PDMS 
pre-polymers up to 0.4 are employed in these trials.  Once 
formed and stabilized, the solu- tion-in-PDMS-pre-polymer 
emulsion is mixed with PDMS curing agent.  After that, the 
mixture is poured on a bare silicon substrate and cured at 60 
ºC in an environment saturated with solvent vapor.  By 
doing this, PDMS is solidified while the evaporation of 
solvent is minimized.  Before it is fully cured, the whole 
PDMS substrate could be stretched or pressed in order to 
shape the cells into ellipses.  Once fully solidified, the 
PDMS structure is further baked at 90 ºC in a dry en- 
vironment to evaporate and expel solvent from the cells.  
Meanwhile, the dispersed semi-crystalline polymers or 
dielectric nanoparticles will eventually deposit on the 
internal surfaces of each cell.  The deposition of extra 
semi-crystalline polymers or dielectric nanoparticles, which 
are capable of storing charges stably, is expected to further 
improve the piezoelectricity of fabricated PDMS electrets.  
At the end, air diffuses across PDMS and fills up the cells.  
Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrographs of four fabricated 
cellular PDMS structures with various deposited layers on 
their internal surfaces.  Among these micrographs, (a) has 
nothing, (b) has iron oxide nanoparticles, (c) has Teflon, and 
(d) has PVA deposited on the cell surfaces.  Unfortunately, 
iron oxide nanoparticles with a diameter about 20 nm are too 
small to be seen, while the deposited Teflon layer might be 
too thin to be observed in the micrograph.  Meanwhile, it is 
observed in Fig. 3(d) that thin PVA layers are deposited on 
cell surfaces as expected, however peeled from PDMS 
surfaces during the preparation of this SEM sample.

Figure 3: SEM micrographs of four fabricated cellular 
PDMS structures 
 
The fabricated PDMS foams are roughly 400 μm thick, and 
diced into rectangles of 3 cm × 3 cm.  The PDMS foams 
are then coated with electrodes on their top and bottom 
surfaces, and charged under strong electric fields.  In our 
trials, charge voltages up to 12 kV, which corresponds to an 
 15
implanted with positive and negative charges on the opposite 
internal surfaces of each cell, which behaves just like a 
dipole.  Upon the application of mechanical or electrical 
stresses, the quasi-dipoles inside a PDMS electret change 
their dimensions and dipole moments as well, which results 
in the desired piezoelectricity.  In the prototype dem- 
onstration, PDMS foams with dielectric nanoparticles or 
semi-crystalline polymers coated internally are formed and 
charged under electric fields up to 30 MV/m.  The resulting 
PDMS electrets show an elastic modulus of 370 kPa and a 
piezoelectric coefficient (d33) up to 106 pC/N, which is 
about 5 times higher than that of PVDF (a typical 
piezoelectric polymer).  Mainly by increasing the porosity 
of the structure and the field for charge implantation, the 
resulting piezoelectricity can be further improved.  As such, 
the demonstrated piezo- electric PDMS electrets could be 
readily integrated and serve as soft and sensitive electro- 
mechanical transducers, which are desired for a variety of 
MEMS applications.

be remotely energized to activate the heating and rapid drug 
release; and (3) development of a new type of delivery 
vehicles that can achieve localized heating and pulsatile 
release.  As such, the presented lipid nanoparticles enable a 
new scheme that combines magnetic control of heating and 
drug delivery, which could greatly enhance the performance 
of encapsulated drugs. 
 
 
 
Fig. 1: Schematic of the proposed solid lipid nanoparticle 
 
Operating Principle 
The structure of the proposed solid lipid nanoparticles 
is illustrated in Fig. 1.  For targeted delivery, it is required 
to (1) pack multiple drugs and ingredients into nanoparticles 
with desired sizes and surface properties, and (2) couple 
these nanoparticles with specific ligands to guide the 
delivery.  In this work, a lipophilic drug (tetracaine), a 
fluorescent dye (Nile red), and γ-Fe2O3 particles are 
dispersed in a melted lipid matrix, and the entire mixture is 
then emulsified in water to form solid nanoparticles once 
cooled down.  The embedded γ-Fe2O3 particles, which have 
been widely used experimentally for numerous biomedical 
applications [24], function as heating elements that can be 
remotely energized by an alternating magnetic field.  Once 
energized, the dissipated heat melts the lipid matrices and 
results in an accelerated release of the encapsulated drugs. 
The encapsulated drugs are released by diffusing 
throughout the lipid nanoparticles.  Consider the case that a 
nanoparticle with a uniform drug concentration C0 is 
immersed in an infinite medium with a background drug 
concentration CS, which is much lower than C0.  Driven by 
the concentration gradient, drug molecules diffuse from the 
nanoparticle to the medium.  To simplify the following 
derivation, it is assumed that the diffusion is purely in the 
radial direction and the diffusion coefficient (D) is spatially 
invariant.  Therefore, the governing equation can be 
expressed as

Since the particle sizes, and therefore the required diffusion 
distances for release, are in the nanometer range, the 
encapsulated drugs could be released at relatively high rates 
even with moderate diffusion coefficients. 
 
 
Fig. 2: Schematic of the high-pressure homogenization process 
 
Fabrication Process 
The power density required to produce nanometer-sized 
emulsions is extremely high.  It is estimated that typically a 
shear rate around 108 s−1 would be required to generate 
oil-in-water emulsions with an average droplet size around 
100 nm [25, 26].  This shear rate is beyond the range of 
most common mixing devices, and barely achieved by few 
approaches such as high-pressure homogenization [27].  
The key component in the homogenization process is a valve 
with micrometer-sized flow path as illustrated in Fig. 2.  
When passing through the minute gap, the fluid is highly 
accelerated so its pressure drops sharply.  Once the pressure 
becomes lower than its vapor pressure, a large number of 
vapor bubbles nucleate inside the fluid.  The multi-phase 
flow eventually slows down so its pressure rises, which 
leads to the collapse of vapor bubbles.  Massive 
cavitational implosions are induced, and the resulting shock 
waves and enormous local temperature rise provide the 
required high power density for nano-emulsification [28, 29].  
In addition, the flow-induced shear and impingement also 
contribute to the emulsification.  At the end, the pressure 
drops to atmospheric pressure once the fluid reaches the 
outlet. 
The proposed solid lipid nanoparticles were prepared 
from trilaurin (from TCI), poloxamer 188 (from Sigma), and 
DI water.  5 grams of γ-Fe2O3 embedded trilaurin was 
heated up to 55 °C and mixed with 1 gram of tetracaine 
(from Sigma) as the model drug.  Meanwhile, 2.5 grams of 
poloxamer 188 was dispersed into 41.5 grams of DI water at 
55 °C.  The lipid mixture was then poured into the 
surfactant-containing DI water and emulsified preliminarily 
using a disperser (HD-300, Hsiangtai) operated at 6000 rpm 
for 30 minutes.  Afterward, the lipid-in-water emulsion was 
 19
temperatures (especially when the lipid matrices are melted), 
a highly accelerated release of the encapsulated tetracaine 
was observed as expected.  It was measured that after a 
20-minute period of heating, roughly 35% of the original 
encapsulated tetracaine was released from the lipid 
nanoparticles as shown in Fig. 6.  Based on the simplified 
diffusion model (whose analytical solutions are expressed as 
Eqn. 3 and 4), a numerical simulation with measured 
parameters including C0 = 6.5×10-2 M, CS = 1.3×10-3 M, a 
= 75 nm, and D = 5.8×10-20 m2/s was performed.  Among 
these parameters, the diffusion coefficient (D) of tetracaine 
molecules across melted lipid matrices was measured at 48 
°C.  Compared with the release profile predicted by the 
simplified model, the measured one shows less variation in 
its slope (release rate) over the 20-minute period, as 
illustrated in Fig. 6.  Ideally, the release rate decreases over 
time because of the reduction in concentration gradient.  
The reason for this deviation is probably the temperature 
dependency of the diffusion coefficient (D), which is low at 
the beginning of the heating period and increases following 
the temperature rise.  Employing a temperature-dependent 
diffusion coefficient in the simulation should greatly reduce 
this deviation.  For example, if values of 50%, 75%, 100%, 
and 110% of the diffusion coefficient measured at 48 °C are 
employed to estimate the drug diffusion during the periods 
from 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, and 15 to 20 minute, 
respectively, the simulated result matches the measured one 
with a deviation less than 10% as indicated in Fig. 6.  In 
another trial, solutions with half of the lipid nanoparticle 
concentration (5%) were magnetically heated.  It was 
measured that the temperature rise was 5 °C lower than the 
10% ones, while the release percentage dropped from 35% 
to 30% (roughly a 15% drop).  To better explain the release 
characteristics of the proposed lipid nanoparticles, a detailed 
model considering the temperature and spatial dependency 
of the drug diffusion process would be needed. 
 
Fig. 5: UV absorption curves after magnetic heating 
 
Another crucial factor for the observed rapid release is 
the size of the lipid nanoparticles.  Based on our simulation 
with various particle sizes as shown in Fig. 7, the release 
percentage in 20 minutes could be elevated from 35% to 
50% and 75% when particles of 100 and 50 nm in diameters 
are employed, respectively.  Since the required diffusion 
distance is shorter when drug molecules diffuse across a 
smaller particle, the drug-release percentage of a smaller 
particle is expected to be higher than that of a large one in 
the same diffusion period.  It is predicted that the purely 
diffusion-induced release varies inversely with the particle 
size (as indicated in Fig. 7), while further experimental 
verification is required.  Although the drug release from 
microparticles is estimated to be slow using the simplified 
diffusion model, the actual experimentally determined 
release rates are surprisingly high in many cases [33-35].  
For example, the drug release from PLGA-based 
microparticles is accelerated by the so-called autocatalytic 
effects [36], which significantly reduce the difference in the 
release rates between PLGA micro- and nanoparticles.  
Meanwhile, it is expected that if further heating is performed, 
the drug-release rate decreases monotonously with the 
decrease in concentration gradient.  It is estimated by the 
simplified model that for particles of 150 nm in diameters, 
the release percentage in the first, second, and third 
20-minute periods will be roughly 35%, 12%, and 8%, 
respectively.  It would require roughly 2 hours of heating to 
achieve a release percentage of 70%.  Over an extended 
period of time, all the encapsulated drug molecules will be 
released by either diffusion (with or without heating) or the 
degradation of lipid matrices.

some specific spots. 
 
Fig. 10: Experimental setups for (a) magnetic shaping and (b) 
magnetic targeting schemes. 
 
Experimental Details 
Magnetic Shaping 
The ferrite-PDMS magnetic composites are prepared by 
dispersing Mn-Zn ferrite powders (N10, Encore Elec- 
tronics Technology) with varying weight percentage in a 
mixture of 10:1 PDMS pre-polymer and curing agent 
(Sylgard 184, Dow-Corning).  The ferrite powders, which 
have an average diameter of roughly 25 μm, are used as 
received.  The magnetic composites (still in a fluid state) 
are then filled in syringes and injected into a container using 
a pump (Model 200, KDS).  As illustrated in Figure 10a, 
the container is filled with a fluid and mounted with two 
Teflon tubes, one for composite supply and the other one as 
the targeted structure.  The elongation and bending of the 
composites are performed on the indicated working plane, 
which is normal to the targeted structure and with the com- 
posite supply located on it.  The magnetic shaping trials are 
controlled by an adjustable (in both strength and direction) 
magnetic field source acting parallel to the working plane. 
 
Fig. 11: Fabrication process of the proposed magnetic carriers 
 
Magnetic Targeting 
The magnetic targeting trials are performed using 
PDMS microchips as illustrated in Figure 10b.  A multi- 
layer molding and bonding process is employed to fabricate 
the microchips with embedded composite rings.  First of all, 
U-shaped composite structures are duplicated using a 
PMMA mold, peeled off, and then embedded around 
micro-channels in the following molding step.  Meanwhile, 
the counterparts are fabricated using a similar process.  At 
the end, the two parts are corona-treated, pressed together, 
and left undisturbed for at least 1 hour at 85 °C for the 
bonding to take effect. 
The magnetic carriers used in the targeting trials are 
fabricated as illustrated in Figure 11.  Iron-oxide nano- 
particles are surface-treated and attached with OH-groups 
first, and then reacted with (HO)3–Si–C18 molecules to 
render the surfaces lipophilic.  Both of the reactions are 
facilitated by repeated vortex shaking and sonication.  The 
resulting lipophilic particles are extracted from the mixture 
and rinsed.  At the end, the lipophilic iron-oxide particles 
are dispersed into melted lipid mixtures (trilaurin, TCI), and 
disperse again to form lipid-in-water emulsions at elevated 
temperatures.  The emulsions are then cooled down and 
stored at room temperature before the targeting trials.

field strength, and equilibrium interface geometry

water, (b) air, and (c) silicone oil 
 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 8 shows the equilibrium shapes of composite- 
water interfaces with ferrite concentrations of 10, 20, and 30 
wt% under a homogeneous magnetic field of 1500 Gauss.  
It is found that at high ferrite concentrations and under high 
field strength, the magnetic interactions will be sufficient to 
deform the injected composites into cylindrical shapes, as 
illustrated in Figure 12.  However, surface tensions are still 
the dominate forces that determine the equilibrium shapes of 
the interfaces.  With our current setup, it is impractical to 
detach a composite from a surface, for example to deform an 
interface from the shape shown in Figure 1a to the one in 
Figure 8c, by increasing the magnetic field strength alone.  
In addition to water, air and silicone oil are also tested in the 
trials, and the results are shown in Figure 13.  Among these 
three cases, the interface between composite and water 
seems to be most stable, mainly because of its high 
interfacial energy. 
In the structure forming demonstration, a ring-shaped 
magnetic structure is attached to a Teflon tube as shown in 
Figure 14.  Under a uniform magnetic field of 1500 Gauss, 
the composite with a ferrite concentration of 30 wt% is 
stretched into a cylinder of 500 μm in diameter.  Following 
the rotation of the magnetic field, the cylinder is bent and 
wound around the targeted structure.  At the end, the mag-

by the surrounding organic-phase flow, depending mainly on 
the flow rates and viscosities of the fluids involved.  Once 
coming out of the embedded orifice, the water-in-organic 
coaxial flow is intersected and focused by the outer 
water-phase flow, without touching the downstream channel 
surfaces.  Ideally, with the assistance of viscous and/or 
inertial forces that act against interfacial tension, the 
water-in-organic coaxial flow could be broken into drops 
with water-in-organic-in-water structure. 
It is crucial to include the embedded orifice as part of 
the 3D focusing mechanism, which could significantly 
reduce the undesired surface distraction.  For hydrophobic 
PDMS channels, it is most likely that the middle 
organic-phase fluid, whose interfacial tension with PDMS is 
much lower than that of the outer water-phase fluid, would 
attach itself to the channel surfaces.  The embedded orifice 
(located in the sidewall separating the two adjacent focusing 
junctions) is utilized to restrict the water-in-organic coaxial 
flow away from the surfaces of the downstream channel.  
This could potentially prevent the attachment, but it is quit 
possible that some unexpected disturbance (especially 
during the starting period) might still lead to the undesired 
attachment and halt the emulsification process immediately.  
To further reduce the undesired surface distraction, the 
downstream channel surfaces are selectively modified into 
hydrophobic.  In addition, surfactants and osmotic agents 
are employed to facilitate the breakup process and stabilize 
the resulting emulsion structures.  Meanwhile, biodegrad- 
able materials and surface-treated γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles are 
dispersed uniformly in the middle organic phase, and 
solidified into magnetic microcapsules once the solvent is 
extracted.  As such, biodegradable and magnetic micro- 
capsules can be fabricated in a reliable and controllable 
manner. 
 
Fig. 17: Fabrication process of the 3D micro-channels 
 
Fabrication Processes 
In the prototype demonstration, two-level photo- 
lithography, PDMS molding and irreversible bonding 
processes are employed to fabricate the proposed 3D 
microchannels, as illustrated in Figure 17.  First of all, a 
layer of 200 µm thick negative photo-resist (SU-8, Micro- 
Chem) is spin-coated and patterned on top of a clean silicon 
wafer to fabricate the mold used for duplicating the bottom 
layer of PDMS microchannels.  Meanwhile, the mold used 
for duplicating the top PDMS layer, which has microchannels 
of two different depths on it, is fabricated by coating and 
patterning a 20 µm thick SU-8 layer first, followed by a 
second SU-8 layer of 200 µm in thickness.  A mixture of 
10:1 PDMS pre-polymer and curing agent (Sylgard 184, 
Dow-Corning) is stirred thoroughly and then degassed under 
vacuum to remove trapped air bubbles.  The pre-polymer 
and curing agent mixture is then poured onto the molds, 
degassed, and cured for 2 hours at 85ºC.  After thoroughly 
cured, the PDMS replicas are peeled off from the molds.  
The top PDMS layer is punched through with a sharp 
metal-tube array to fabricate the connecting holes for 3 inlets 
and 1 outlet, and ultrasonically cleaned in an ethanol bath to 
remove residual debris from its surface.  The surfaces of the 
two PDMS layers are then treated with a hand-held corona 
treater (BD-20AC, Electro-Technic Products), which ionizes 
surrounding air and creates localized plasma to activate the 
surfaces for irreversible bonding.  The intensity of the 
corona is set at a relatively low level in order to produce a 
stable but soft corona with minimal crackling and sparking.  
The corona-treated surfaces are then pressed together and left 
undisturbed for at least one hour at 85ºC for the bonding to 
take effect.  At the end, PTFE tubes are inserted into the 
punched holes to build the necessary interconnection for 
sample injection and discharge. 
 
Fig. 18(a) and (b): Schematic of the self-aligned photo-grafting 
process and (c): Photo of a modified PDMS device 
 
Once the 3D PDMS micro-channels are fabricated, the 
downstream channel surfaces are selectively modified into 
hydrophobic utilizing a self-aligned photo-grafting process.  
As illustrated in Figure 18(a), ethyl acetate (mixed with oleic 
acid to adjust its viscosity) is injected into the upstream 
channel, while its front automatically stopped at the exit of 
the embedded orifice by surface tension.  In this scheme, 
ethyl acetate functions as a mask to protect the upstream 
channel surfaces from photo-grafting reaction.  Afterward, 
a grafting solution containing 0.34 g of benzophenone 
(photo-initiator), 0.32 g of Pluronic F-68 (to improve the 
solubility of benzophenone in aqueous phase), 15 g of 
acrylic acid (monomer), 27.6 g of tert-butanol (solvent) and 
43.6 g of water is prepared and injected into the downstream 
channel.  Since the grafting solution has a higher interfacial 
energy with PDMS than ethyl acetate does, it is not flowing 
further into the embedded orifice.  The 3D PDMS channels 
are then exposed with a UV lamp (λ = 253.7 nm) for about 
10 minutes to activate the photo-grafting reaction.  As a 
result, the downstream channel surfaces (e.g. the area with a 
darker color in Figure 18(c)) are converted into hydrophilic.  
After the photo-reaction, the channels are washed with 
ethanol and then DI-water to remove the residue ethyl 
acetate and the grafting solution.

and without aqueous droplet encapsulated inside.  The 
overall drop size decreases over time while the color turns 
dark due to the change in optical properties.  Roughly 85% 
(or more) of the volume is lost because of the extraction of 
solvent.  In case that a magnetic field is applied externally, 
the fabricated capsule is attracted to the sidewall and rotated 
with its axis aligned to the field as shown in Figure 23.  
Figure 24(a) shows the SEM micrograph of a fabricated 
poly(L-lactic acid) micro-capsule with embedded magnetic 
nanoparticles clearly observed on the surface.  The em- 
bedded γ-Fe2O3 nano-particles, which have been widely used 
experimentally for numerous biomedical applications, can 
potentially function as targeting and heating elements.  For 
example, the magnetic capsules can be targeted to some 
specific sites with the guidance of an external field, and 
remotely energized by the field to melt and accelerate the 
release from the capsules.  In addition to poly(L-lactic acid), 
phosphocholine (DOPC) is also tested in the trials to form 
lipid microvesicles as shown in Figure 24(b).

英文摘要 
This report presents the development of magnetic lipid 
nanoparticles that could serve as controlled delivery vehicles 
for releasing encapsulated drugs in a desired manner.  The 
nanoparticles are composed of multiple drugs in lipid 
matrices, which are solid at body temperature and melt 
around 45 to 55 °C.  In addition, super-paramagnetic 
γ-Fe2O3 particles with sizes ranging from 5 to 25 nm are 
surface modified and dispersed uniformly in the lipid 
nanoparticles.  In the prototype demonstration, lipid nano- 
particles with average sizes between 100 and 180 nm were 
fabricated by high-pressure homogenization at elevated 
temperatures.  When exposed to an alternating magnetic 
field of 60 kA/m at 25 kHz, a solution containing 2 g/L 
encapsulated γ-Fe2O3 particles showed a temperature 
increase from 37 to 50 °C in 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, the 
dissipated heat melted the surrounding lipid matrices and 
resulted in an accelerated release of the encapsulated drugs.  
As such, the presented lipid nanoparticles enable a new 
scheme that combines magnetic control of heating and drug 
delivery, which could greatly enhance the performance of 
encapsulated drugs.

INTRODUCTION 
Aiming to improve drug performance, the idea of 
controlled delivery with desired release profiles on specific 
targeted sites has been proposed since the late 1960s [1].  It 
is commonly recognized that new drugs and novel delivery 
systems are equally important for achieving real progress in 
drug therapy [2, 3].  By precisely controlling the 
concentration and distribution of a drug inside the body, 
potential side effects and required drug dosage could be 
significantly reduced, while new therapeutic schemes could 
be realized.  Over the past few decades, there have been 
considerable efforts in developing various nanoparticles as 
effective drug delivery vehicles [4-6].  By virtue of their 
small sizes and large surface areas covered with 
functionalized ligands, nanoparticles can be targeted to 
specific locations or cells within the body [7, 8].  Further- 
more, some nanoparticles can even be activated by chemical 
stimuli, pH variation, remote heating, or rapidly oscillating 
electromagnetic field [9-11]. 
Solid lipid nanoparticles, which are designed to alter 
the pharmacokinetics and bio-distribution of associated 
drugs, are particles of lipid matrices with drugs embedded 
and polymeric stabilizers on the surfaces [12, 13].  In 
general, solid lipid nanoparticles are employed to deliver 
lipophilic drugs at constant rates and over long periods of 
time.  Although continuous delivery can maintain drug 
concentration in a desired range to reduce adverse side 
effects, many situations also require, or would benefit from, 
a pulsatile release of drugs [14-16].  The reasons are 
mainly related to the nature of physiological releases, in 
which periods of restoration of certain bodily functions 
between consecutive actions are often necessary.  In 
addition, long-term administration of many potent drugs, 
such as those used in cancer treatments, requires drug 
administration at periodic intervals to avoid the poisoning of 
healthy tissues.  To address this need, a new scheme that 
integrates magnetic heating elements into solid lipid 
nanoparticles for release control and treatment enhancement 
is developed.  The heating is performed around 45 to 55 °C, 
during which solid lipid matrices are melted and the 
encapsulated drug molecules diffuse out of the nanoparticles.  
Meanwhile, the temperature rise (also described as 
hyperthermia [17]) could potentially stimulate the immune 
response for non-specific immunotherapy of certain diseases.

Surface modification of γ-Fe2O3 particles 
With appropriate surface coating, iron-oxide particles 
can be dispersed uniformly into a variety of media [24].  
The fabrication of iron-oxide embedded solid lipid 
nanoparticles is illustrated in Fig. 2.  First of all, 1.6 grams 
of γ-Fe2O3 particles (from Aldrich) were added into 15 mL of 
ammonia hydroxide (30%).  The mixture was vortexed and 
sonicated repeatedly for three hours to facilitate the 
incorporation of OH groups onto particle surfaces.  After- 
ward, γ-Fe2O3 particles were extracted from the mixture 
using a strong magnet, and rinsed with de-ionized (DI) water 
four times followed by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) twice.  
The attachment of OH-groups on γ-Fe2O3 particle surfaces 
can be verified by the significant increase in the hydrophility 
and water solubility of the treated particles.  Meanwhile, 3 
mL of octadecyltrimethoxysilane (from Acros) was mixed 
and reacted with 20 mL of DI water at room temperature: 
OHCH3CSi)HO(OH3CSi)OCH( 318321833 +−−→+−−  (5)  
The mixture eventually separated into two layers, with the 
denser (CH3O)3-Si-C18 floating on the top.  Approximately 
8 hours later, the top (CH3O)3-Si-C18 molecules were 
extracted and reacted with the hydroxidized γ-Fe2O3 particles 
to render their surfaces lipophilic.  The reaction, 
OH3CSi)OFe(CSi)HO(OHFe3 2183183 +−−−→−−+−  (6)  
, was again facilitated by repeated vortex shaking and 
sonication.  The resulting lipophilic particles were then 
extracted from the mixture and rinsed with DMSO twice 
followed by DI water twice.  At the end, the lipophilic 
γ-Fe2O3 particles were dispersed into melted lipid mixtures 
with required amounts at elevated temperatures.

High-pressure homogenization 
The power density required to produce nanometer-sized 
emulsions is extremely high.  It is estimated that typically a 
shear rate around 108 s−1 would be required to generate 
oil-in-water emulsions with an average droplet size around 
100 nm [28, 29].  This shear rate is beyond the range of 
most common mixing devices, and barely achieved by few 
approaches such as high-pressure homogenization [30].  
The key component in the homogenization process is a valve 
with micrometer-sized flow path as illustrated in Fig. 3.  
When passing through the minute gap, the fluid is highly 
accelerated so its pressure drops sharply.  Once the pressure 
becomes lower than its vapor pressure, a large number of 
vapor bubbles nucleate inside the fluid.  The multi-phase 
flow eventually slows down so its pressure rises, which 
leads to the collapse of vapor bubbles.  Massive 
cavitational implosions are induced, and the resulting shock 
waves and enormous local temperature rise provide the 
required high power density for nano-emulsification [31, 32].  
In addition, the flow-induced shear and impingement also 
contribute to the emulsification.  At the end, the pressure 
drops to atmospheric pressure once the fluid reaches the 
outlet. 
The proposed solid lipid nanoparticles were prepared 
from trilaurin (from TCI), poloxamer 188 (from Sigma), and 
DI water.  5 grams of γ-Fe2O3 embedded trilaurin was 
heated up to 55 °C and mixed with 1 gram of tetracaine 
(from Sigma) as the model drug.  Meanwhile, 2.5 grams of 
poloxamer 188 was dispersed into 41.5 grams of DI water at 
55 °C.  The lipid mixture was then poured into the 
surfactant-containing DI water and emulsified preliminarily 
using a disperser (HD-300, Hsiangtai) operated at 6000 rpm 
for 30 minutes.  Afterward, the lipid-in-water emulsion was 
further refined using a high-pressure homogenizer (Panda 
2K, Niro Soavi S.p.A) at 55 °C with pressures ranging from 
250 to 1000 bar and time periods between 1 and 5 minutes.  
At the end, the lipid-in-water emulsion, which contains 
drugs and γ-Fe2O3 particles inside the lipid phase, was 
cooled down and stored at room temperature before further 
heating and drug releasing trials.  Because of the 
employment of poloxamer 188 surfactant, which stabilizes 
the lipid-water interface with repulsion through a steric 
mechanism [33], the aggregation of fabricated lipid 
nanoparticles was greatly eliminated.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
Characterization of lipid nanoparticles 
The size distribution of the fabricated lipid nano- 
 31
overall solution volume of 50 mL, the homogenization step 
was completed in 1 minute, while extended processing only 
resulted in negligible variation in emulsion sizes.  On the 
other hand, the lipid-to-water ratio was also found to be 
affecting the particle size, as shown in Fig. 8.  When less 
lipids were dispersed into water, the size of the resulting 
lipid nanoparticles decreased, which may be caused by the 
simultaneous decrease in solution viscosity.  Also shown in 
Fig. 7 and 8, the error bars mark the range of the mean plus 
and minus one standard deviation in each measurement.

Nanoparticles with an average diameter of 150 nm and 
various γ-Fe2O3 concentrations were employed in our 
heating trials.  Alcohol thermometers, which were not 
heated up in a magnetic field as thermocouples were, were 
employed to measure the temperature rise caused by 
magnetic heating.  The magnitude of the generated 
magnetic field changed upon varying the frequency.  With 
our current setup, the optimal alternating magnetic field for 
heating is 60 kA/m at 25 kHz.  Under this field, the 
background temperature in the experiments was set around 
37 °C (body temperature) and the resulting temperature rise 
in the bulk solution was measured as shown in Fig. 9.  The 
heating caused by electrical resistance and other non- 
magnetic mechanisms are responsible for a background 
temperature rise of 4 °C.  With lower γ-Fe2O3 concentration, 
the temperature rise was lower as expected.  Among them, 
the maximum temperature rise achieved was 8 °C (after 
compensation) in 20 minutes at a γ-Fe2O3 concentration of 
20 g/L inside the lipid nanoparticles.  It is expected that the 
particle temperature would be much higher than the bulk 
solution temperature since the heat was generated therein.  
Under this circumstance, the heat dissipated from the 
embedded γ-Fe2O3 particles would melt the lipid 
nanoparticles.

CONCLUSION

solid lipid nanoparticles.  The nanoparticles are composed 
of multiple drugs in lipid matrices, which are solid at body 
temperature and melt around 45 to 55 °C.  In addition, 
super-paramagnetic γ-Fe2O3 particles with diameters ranging 
from 5 to 25 nm are surface modified and distributed 
uniformly in the lipid nanoparticles.  In the prototype 
demonstration, lipid nanoparticles with average diameters 
between 100 and 180 nm were fabricated by high-pressure 
emulsification at elevated temperatures.  The maximum 
γ-Fe2O3 concentration inside the resulting lipid nanoparticles 
was 20 g/L, while a large percentage of the dissolved 
γ-Fe2O3 particles separated from the melted lipid matrices 
during the homogenization process.  When exposed to an 
alternating magnetic field of 60 kA/m at 25 kHz, a solution 
containing 2 g/L encapsulated γ-Fe2O3 particles showed a 
temperature rise from 37 to 50 °C in 20 minutes.  
Meanwhile, the dissipated heat melted the lipid matrices and 
resulted in an accelerated release of the encapsulated drugs.  
Based on our simulation, the release percentage in 20 
minutes could be elevated from 35% to 50% and 70% when

ABSTRACT 
We have successfully demonstrated the fabrication of 
piezoelectric PDMS electrets utilizing foam forming 
and micro plasma discharge processes.  To obtain 
electromechanical sensitivity, PDMS foams with 
micrometer-sized closed cells are implanted with 
positive and negative charges on the opposite internal 
surfaces of each cell, which behaves just like a dipole.  
In the prototype demonstration, PDMS foams with 
nanoparticles or polymers coated internally are 
formed and charged under electric fields up to 30 
MV/m.  The resulting PDMS electrets show an 
elastic modulus of 370 kPa and a piezoelectric 
coefficient (d33) up to 106 pC/N, which is about 5 
times higher than that of PVDF (a common piezo- 
electric polymer).  As such, the demonstrated piezo- 
electric PDMS electrets could serve as soft and 
sensitive electromechanical transducers, which are 
desired for a variety of MEMS applications. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Electrets, the electrostatic equivalents of permanent 
magnets, are dielectric materials that have quasi- 
permanent electric charges or dipole polarization [1].  
They function as permanent sources of electric fields, 
which are employed to act on objects, interact with 
other physical fields, or induce AC current.  Con- 
ventionally, electrets are made up of certain die- 
lectrics with charges stored mostly on their surfaces.  
The electret effects are usually resulted from dipolar 
polarization, charge displacement inside molecules or 
domains, and the formation of spatial or surface 
charges.  To fabricate electrets, dielectrics are placed 
in electric fields and subjected to additional physical 
actions, which either reduce dipolar relaxation or 
accelerate the migration of charged particles. 
 
Ferroelectrets, which are polymer foams with bipolar 
charges stored in each cell, have recently been dem- 
onstrated to be highly efficient in charge storage and 
showing unexpected piezoelectricity [2-4].  Surpris- 
ingly, completely non-polar materials without any 
molecular dipoles can behave almost like ferro- 
electrics.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to control the 
sizes and geometries of ferroelectrets, or integrate 
them with microsystems.  To address these fabric- 
cation issues, this paper presents controlled foam 
forming, surface modification, and micro plasma 
discharge processes that could readily produce piezo- 
electric PDMS electrets with desired geometries and 
properties.  In addition, these processes should be 
compatible with common MEMS fabrication.  As 
such, the proposed piezoelectric PDMS electrets 
could be readily integrated and serve as soft and 
sensitive electromechanical transducers, which are 
desired for a variety of applications.

and piezoelectricity 
 
OPERATING PRINCIPLE 
To obtain electromechanical sensitivity, PDMS foams 
with micrometer-sized closed cells are implanted 
with positive and negative charges on the opposite 
internal surfaces of each cell, which behaves just like 
a dipole.  The charging of the cells is realized by 
placing PDMS foams in strong electric fields, which 
eventually cause the air inside the cells to break down.  
When performed between two parallel plate elec- 
trodes, the breakdown criteria can usually be pre- 
dicted by the Paschen’s law [5], while fails for gaps 
smaller than 10 μm in air at one atmosphere [6].  
Generally, the required breakdown fields are higher 
for smaller cells.  Once broken down, micro plasma 
discharges are generated inside the cells and then self 
extinguished because of the deposition of charges on 
the internal surfaces of each cell.  The charged 
PDMS foams are flexible and highly polarized.  Up- 
on the application of mechanical or electrical stresses, 
the quasi-dipoles inside PDMS electrets change their 
dimensions and dipole moments, which results in the 
desired piezoelectricity as illustrated in Fig. 1.  The 
application of a force to a PDMS electret is expected 
to induce additional charges on the top and bottom 
electrodes.  Overall, the piezoelectricity of a PDMS 
electret is dependent on its porosity, elastic modulus, 
cell size, and surface charge density. 
high temperatures, less stable charges are more likely 
to be expelled from the surfaces and replaced with 
more stable charges.  After being internally charged, 
the PDMS electrets behave like soft and sensitive 
piezoelectric materials that can be used to inter- 
convert signals between acoustical and electrical or 
mechanical and electrical.

EXPERIMENTAL AND RESULTS 
The piezoelectricity of fabricated and charged PDMS 
electrets are characterized using a setup illustrated in 
Fig. 4.  A force is applied periodically by a pneu- 
matic cylinder to the tested sample, which is clamped 
on a customized fixture.  The elastic modulus of the 
cellular PDMS electrets is measured to be about 370 
kPa, which is slightly less than half of that of solid 
PDMS structures with same thickness.  Meanwhile, 
electrodes of the tested sample are connected to a 
charge amplifier (as shown in Fig. 5), which converts 
sensed charge variations into amplified voltage out- 
puts.  When air pressures ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 
kgf/cm2 are applied, the peak output voltages, which 
increase with the applied pressures, are around 60 to 
70 mV as shown in Fig. 6(a).  In the following trials, 
the same 40 N force, which corresponds to an air 
pressure of 1 kgf/cm2, is applied on each of the 3 cm 
× 3 cm large tested sample.  Under this condition, a 
1 mV voltage output is estimated to indicate an 82.3 
pC charge induction on the electrodes.  Fig. 7 shows 
the measured piezoelectricity of two PDMS electrets, 
whose cell surfaces are coated with iron oxide nano- 
particles and Teflon, and charged with a charge 
voltage of 5 KV.  For the nanoparticle deposited 
sample, the application of a 40 N force actually 
results in a 3290 pC charge variation, which corre- 
sponds to a piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 82 pC/N.  
Meanwhile, the Teflon coated sample shows a 
piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 106 pC/N, which is 
about 5 times higher than that of a typical piezo- 
electric polymer PVDF.

pressure and amplifier output and (b) charge poten- 
tial and piezoelectricity of pure PDMS electrets 
 
 
Figure 7: Measured charge variation when a 40 N 
force is applied periodically on two samples 
 
Compared to the piezoelectricity of pure PDMS 
electrets, which is shown in Fig. 6(b), the deposition 
of dielectric iron oxide nanoparticles or semi- 
crystalline Teflon is found to greatly enhance the 
piezoelectricity of the fabricated PDMS electrets.  
In addition, it is also demonstrated in Fig. 6(b) that a 
higher charge potential usually results in a higher 
piezoelectricity of the charged sample.  In general, 
the resulting piezoelectricity of an internally charged 
PDMS foam is dependent on its (1) porosity, (2) 
elastic modulus, (3) cell size, and (4) surface charge 
density, which could be adjusted by varying the 
surface properties of cells and charge voltage.  
Mainly by increasing the porosity of the structure and
