propagation velocity of the basal surface. For the 
interface between the two flowing layers, we first 
follow the approach by Fraccarollo & Capart [2002], 
where the two layers are of the same ve-locity and 
without any mass exchange. By depth integration and 
dimension analysis with appropriate boundary 
conditions we arrive at the leading order governing 
equations. Regarding to the proposed model equations 
a shock-capturing numerical scheme has been 
implemented, and laboratory experiments have also 
performed. With the help of the numerical model we 
are able to investigate the key features of the 
proposed model as well as the plausibility of 
application in hazard mitigation works. The 
experimental validation helps to confirm the 
capability of the model and to determine the relevant 
pa-rameters.

一、參加會議經過 
The location of this conference is in Banff, Alberta, Canada. I took the plane to Calgary 
airport and went to Bannf by car. The distance between Calgary and Banff is about 150 km. 
When I arrived at the Hotel, it was 2:30 in the morning on June 02 (local time). My check-in 
procedure is completed in the afternoon on June 02 and I have had a short visit to the 
exhibition in the booth zone. In the afternoon of June 03 there was a social program 
“opening icebreaker reception”.  
On Monday June 4 :  
In the morning, there were two keynote lectures and two invited lectures. 
In the afternoon, there were four parallel sessions. 
In the evening, there was one Heim Lecture (18:30 – 20:00). 
On Tuesday June 5:  
In the morning, there were one keynote lecture and three invited lectures. 
In the afternoon, there were four parallel sessions. 
On Wednesday June 6:  
Field trip. 
On Tuesday June 7:  
In the morning, there were one keynote lecture and one invited lecture, which were 
followed by four parallel sessions.

landslide phenomena. 32 landslide type keywords, compared to 29 used in the 1978 Varnes 
classification are introduced.  
三、考察參觀活動 
The tour was scheduled on 4th June from 08:00 to 17:00. Ten stops of geohazards along 
highway corridors through foothills and mountainous terrain are arranged. They are 
(１) Five mile creek: debris flow on August 4, 1999. 
(２) Area geohazards on the “east end of rundle”. 
(３) Avalanche area on the “Back of Big Sister”. 
(４) Mount Sparrowhawk area geohazards. 
(５) Mount Buller area Geohards. 
(６) Rock glacer site. 
(７) Highwook pass. 
(８) King Creek – historical debris flows. 
(９) Viewpoint on the “Mount Kidd”. 
(１０) Viewpoint on the “Lac Des Arcs”. 
四、建議 
此次會議的參與，對個人專業知識的增長以及國際視野拓展均有相當的助益。唯費用
並不低，國科會補助 8 萬元，機票加註冊費用就將近 8 萬元，加上當地住宿並不便宜，因
此在花費上相當吃緊。若未來在補助上能夠考慮不同區域能有不同的額度，會較為恰當。

On Friday June 8: departure back to Taiwan. 
The topic of my talk is ”A two-phase model for dry density-varying granular flows over 
general topography”, which is schedule in the TC-103 Special Session “Advanced 
Numerical Modelling＂ and was delivered in the afternoon of June 7. 
二、與會心得 
此次會議較為感興趣並與報告人現階段研究課題相關的議題分別有： 
 ”Stability analysis of unsaturated deposits: effect of soil properties and hydro-mechanical 
coupling” by Prof. Buscarnera, Northwestern University, USA. 
Investigation the mechanical conditions governing the activation of shallow landslides in 
unsaturated deposits is performed. It is shown that the range of slope inclinations prone to 
originate a runaway instability can be a function of hydro-mechanical coupling terms. The 
dependence on the material constants are not directly associated with the shearing 
resistance. 
 ”Modeling of propagation and entrainment phenomena for landslides of the flow type: the 
May 1998 case study.” by Prof. Pastor, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain. 
A depth-integrated coupled SPH model is applied to simulating the landslides of flow type. 
The propagation path, distribution of the deposits and velocities are highly influenced by 
the entrainment rate and the extent of the erodible area. 
 “Fluid flow focusing in passive continental margins: Significance to submarine slope 
instability.” by Prof. Urgeles, Institut de Ciencies del Mar, Barcelona, Spain 
Large scale slope failures occur commonly in passive continental margins, where little 
seismic activity is observed. The margin architecture and the distribution of various marine 
sediment types plays a significant role in overpressure development and impacts the most 
likely location for the occurrence of slope failure in passive continental margins. 
此外，尚有幾個非常有啟發性的議題，例如： 
 “Case studies of constrained creeping landslides in Switzerland.” by Prof. Puzrin, ETH 
Zurich, Switzerland. 
Three large creeping landslides in Switzerland are investigated. They have a common 
feature that they are constrained at the bottom by an obstacle, but they behave totally 
differently. The large variety of landslide behavior patterns is explained by a simple 
analytical model, where the critical parameter appeared to be the rate the changes of the 
lateral earth pressure in the compression zone at the bottom of the landslides.  
 “Varnes classification of landslide types, an update.” by Prof. Hungr, University of British 
Columbia, Canada. 
The most widely used system of landslide classification is proposed by Varnes 1978. A 
modification is introduced to reflect recent advances in knowledge and understanding of

Paper Title: A two-phase model for dry density-varying granular flows over general topography
Paper ID No: 467
Dear Yih-Chin Tai:
We虐e pleased to inform you that your paper has been accepted for Oral Presentation at the 11th International & 2nd North
American Symposium on Landslides in Banff, Alberta, Canada. At this time we do not yet know the exact day and time of your
presentation and will inform you of those details by early March.
If this is not your preference and you instead wish to present your paper as a poster in the Thursday afternoon poster session, please
contact the Technical Chair: techchair@isl-nasl2012.ca. If a colleague will be presenting on your behalf, please forward this message
and the information below to them.
On the day of your presentation, you (or your designated presenter) are invited to attend the Speakers� Breakfast at 7:00 a.m. in the
Banff Springs Hotel [room to be determined] where the session chair(s) can meet you to prepare an introduction. It will be helpful if you
bring along 2 or 3 written sentences about you that the session chair can use for your introduction.
Please bring your presentation on a USB flash drive (memory stick) for easy loading onto the session laptop. All presentations must
be loaded onto the session laptop � no presenter will be allowed to use their own laptop. Presentations must be in PowerPoint
(.ppt) format only. The ISL/NASL 2012 online submission module has an option for uploading your presentation well before the
symposium � we will also have a Speakers� Desk in the registration area where we will be collecting the presentations.
Since this conference received such a large number of quality paper submissions such as yours, we have had to limit the time available
for each oral presentation. You will have 12 minutes to present your material, plus 2 minutes for questions and 1 minute for setup.
Please do NOT try to present your entire paper. In 12 minutes, your goal should be to entice the audience to read your paper. Show
them just the highlights, and avoid going into detail.
A good guideline is one slide for every minute or 12 slides total. Use large readable fonts, and do not put too much information on the
slides. Many authors find it helpful to write out the exact words they are going to say, and to read the presentation from a script. This is
one of the best ways to ensure that you stay on time, and that you do not forget to mention your key points.
If you find that you will be unable to attend the conference and you do not have a colleague who can present on your behalf, please let
us know so that we can make adjustments to the technical program. If a colleague will be presenting your paper as a 濯ast-minute�
change, please let us know who that person is, and please tell them to attend the Speakers� Breakfast.
As the symposium approaches, we are all very excited about this opportunity for the International and North American landslides
communities to once again meet, exchange ideas, and make new acquaintances. We look forward to seeing you in Banff this June for
ISL/NASL 2012.
If you require assistance or additional information about the symposium, please do not hesitate to contact us at info@isl-nasl2012.ca or
visit the symposium website at www.isl-nasl2012.ca.
Sincerely,
ISL/NASL 2012 Technical Committee

that the dry granular material is regarded as a 
binary mixture of a solid and an interstitial fluid 
(air). That is, the volume fraction of the air is asso-
ciated with the variation of density of the flows. 
By the advantage of excessively large difference of 
density between the two constituents, the force of 
the interaction become dominant in the momen-
tum equation for the fluid phase, whilst it is neg-
ligible for the momentum of the solid constituent. 
In addition, Shen et al. (2011) also introduce a 
mechanism of entrainment/extrusion of air, so that 
the total volume may vary according to the stretch-
ing/ contracting behavior of the flowing body.
The present study is an extension of Shen et al. 
(2011) for flows of variable density over a non-trivial 
basal surface. It is implemented to a terrain-fitted 
coordinate system, so that the evaluation the physi-
cal variables are computed in a mesh system fitted 
to the topographic surface. The non-oscillatory 
central scheme proposed by Jiang & Tadmor (1997) 
is adopted for numerical calculation. Numerical 
tests are performed in investigating the behavior of 
a finite mass of granular material flowing down an 
inclined plane onto a horizontal zone.

2.1 Topography-fitted coordinate system
In a vertical-horizontal Cartesian coordinate 
system (x, y, z) the topographic surface is given 
by z = b (x, y, z), then the unit normal vector is 
given by

On the topographic surface one can define

by Bouchut & Westdickenberg (2004). For a 
deforming coordinate system, one can rely on the

coordinates and an arbitrary coordinates by.

2.2 Equations of mass and momentum 
conservation
The dry granular material is regarded as a binary 
mixture composed of a solid and an interstitial fluid 
(air), where the sum of their volume fractions adds 
up to unity. Since the flow speed considered here is 
much less than the speed of sound, the interstitial 
air is supposed to be a quasi-ideal fluid of constant 
density. Let ρ s  and ρ f  be the partial density of 
the solid and the interstitial fluid, respectively. 
With the assumption of constant true densities,  
and and the volume fraction of the solid phase 
being denoted by ϕ, one obtains the partial densi-
ties by  and  In case of no 
mass exchange between the two constituents, the 
balance equations for mass and momentum read.

where the superscript ψ ∈{s, f} denotes the solid 
and fluid phases, respectively. Here, vi represents 
the velocities of the corresponding constituents, 
Ti denotes the solid/fluid stress tensors, fiint indi-
cates the interaction forces and g is the gravita-
tional acceleration. Since the sum of the balance

with nb denoting the unit normal vector of the base, 
Nb the normal pressure at the basal surface, tanδ 
the basal friction coefficient. Due to the low speed 
of the interstitial air, its basal stress is assumed to 
be negligible.
For the behavior of dry granular, a common 
constitutive relation is the Mohr-Coulomb law, 
in which the normal stresses of the solid species 
are connected with the normal solid stress at the 
basal surface by the earth pressure coefficient, Ka/p, 
which is a function of the angles of internal fric-
tion and the friction between the particles and the 
chute surface (c.f. Savage & Hutter 1989). In the 
present study, the value of Ka/p is taken to be 1, to 
isolate the complex effect due to the earth pressure 
coefficient.
2.4 UC formulation and model equations
Since there are two coordinate systems, the Carte-
sian and the UC systems, every vectorial quantity 
can be expressed using either system. We shall use 
i∈{x, y, z} and m, n∈{ξ, η, ζ} for the index opera-
tion, unless otherwise specified. Following Tai & 
Kuo (2008) or Tai et al. (2011), the equation sys-
tem, (6) and (8) – (9), can be rewritten in the UC 
formulation,
∂ ( ) ∂ ( ) = ,t m+ 0  (18)
∂ ( )⎡⎣ ⎤⎦ ∂ ( )⎡⎣ ⎤⎦ = ,t m fmqJ− + 0−  (19)
 
 (20)
 
  (21)
for i∈{x, y, z} and m∈{ξ, η, ζ}, where J = det Ω. 
In (20) and (21), the solid stress and the pressure 
are of the relations
T p( )Σsim = ( )s ( )sij ( )imΩ ΩT T Ω=− ,  (22)
respectively. Equations, (18)–(21), are essentially 
the conservation system of the Cartesian com-
ponents, but in a mesh system fitted to the topo-
graphic surface.
With the assumption of small curvature and 
shallow flow depth, the term ζ∂xs in (5) is negligi-
ble, so that the Jacobian matrix reduces to
Ω Ω Ω Ωb b bJd d d .=  (23)
With the help of the boundary consitions, 
(12)–(14) and (16)–(17), and the Leibniz rule, the 
depth-integrated equations read

for the mass balance, and
 
(26)
 
 (27)
for the momentum conservation. In (27), the last 
term on the RHS
 
(28)
is the interaction force, which is negligible for the 
solid constituent due to the excessive density differ-
ence, see Shen et al. (2011). The depth-integrated 
interaction in (28) term is phenomenological 
and highly non-linear. In the current study, it is 
approximated by
as suggested in Pitman & Le (2005). However, fur-
ther study on its approximation is still needed.
Following the scaling analysis by Tai & Kuo 
(2008) or Tai et al. (2011), we adopt the assump-
tions of small curvature and shallow flow thick-
ness, yielding that the normal stresses of the con-
stituents can be approximated by
where the second terms in the square bracket 
are the centrifugal acceleration due to the local 
1684
the fact that the interstitial fluid flows out from the 
flow body, so that the total depth vanishes.
In the result figures (Figs. 1 to 3), the transition 
zone lies between the two dash-dotted lines. 
Figure 1 illustrates the thickness contour plots, 
in which the levels of the contour lines are 0.001, 
0.01 and from 0.04 to 0.46 at increments of 0.03. 
The evolution of the solid volume fraction with the 
flow body is shown in the Figure 2. The flowing 
mass accelerates on the chute of the inclined sec-
tion and deposits on the horizontal plane. While 
sliding on the inclined section of the chute, the 
front part extended rapidly by the advantage of the 
negative value of the depth gradient. At this stage, 
the front part exhibits the lower volume fraction 
of solid constituent as well as the small density. 
The sequential cross-sections along ξ at η = 0.0 are 
shown in Figure 3. The black dashed lines repre-
sent the equivalent depth of solid phase (hϕ), the 
dotted lines indicate the equivalent depth of the air 
within the flow body, and the solid lines mark the 
free surface of the flow.
4 CONCLUSIONS
A two-phase depth-averaging thin layer model for 
dry granular flows of variable density flowing over 
a non-trivial basal surface of small curvature is 
introduced. The interaction force between the two 
constituents is suggested to follow the Richardson-
Zaki relation in the extreme case of high Reynolds 
number. The evolution of the volume fraction 
results in the variation of the density. The entrain-
ment rate is suggested to be function of the veloc-
ity gradient of the solid phase.
The features of the proposed model are illus-
trated by numerical simulations, in which a finite 
mass of dry granular material dlides down an 
inclined flat chute to be deposited on a horizon-
tal plane. The evolution of the volume fraction 
is illustraed. The almost uniform distribution of
