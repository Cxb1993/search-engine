ABSTRACT 
This study applies computational geometric algebra based on a 4 4×  homogeneous transformation matrix 
and Snell’s law of geometrical optics to analyze skew rays and the errors of a light ray’s path as it passes 
through a cylindrical lens. The author addresses two important topics: (1) the determination of the direction of a 
reflected or refracted ray by Snell’s law and (2) the expression of the combination of two principal sources of 
light path error using error analysis. In topic (2), one of the sources is the translational errors ixΔd , iyΔd , and 
izΔd  and the rotational errors ixΔω , iyΔω , and izΔω  that determine the deviation of the light path at each 
boundary surface, while the other source is the differential changes induced in the incident point position and 
the unit directional vector of the refracted/reflected ray as a result of differential changes in the position and unit 
directional vector of the light source. The methodology presented in this study provides a comprehensive and 
robust approach for evaluating the error of a light ray path as it passes through a cylindrical lens. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Currently, the ray tracing method is the core method used in many optical design tools and analysis 
software. The evaluation of the performance of an optical system during its theoretical design stage requires the 
ability to determine the paths of the light rays as they undergo reflection and refraction at the boundaries of the 
various optical elements within the system. The light path can be determined using a ray tracing technique in 
which the optical laws of reflection and refraction are systematically applied at each boundary encountered by 
the light ray [1, 2]. In general, the light rays in an optical system can be classified as either axial rays, meridional 
rays, or skew rays. Axial rays and meridional rays can be traced using relatively simple trigonometric formulas 
or even graphically if a low precision is acceptable. Meridional rays in the paraxial region of an optical system 
can also be approximately traced via the successive application of matrix production [3]. A skew ray, which is 
the most general ray, is significantly difficult to trace. Nevertheless, skew ray tracing is essential while modeling 
an optical system and evaluating its performance. Consequently, when designing optical systems, it is 
conventional to trace the rays using actual light sources and the optical components being used. To facilitate the 
tracing of skew rays, Lin [4] reformulated the traditional optical laws of reflection and refraction in terms of 
revolution geometry. Subsequently, he conducted a sensitivity analysis based on a method of skew ray tracing to 
determine the changes in a light ray path as it crossed the boundary between the different media. 
Ray tracing provides a powerful technique for analyzing the performance of optical lenses and is an 
essential task in the analysis and design of optical systems. The traced rays generally include those that start at a 
given set of object points and pass through a given set of points on the aperture stop [5]. In the differential ray 
tracing process, the effects of each optical component are evaluated by differentiating the equations related to 
the ray configuration of the rays before and after their transformation at a component surface [6, 7]. Such ray 
tracing approaches enable the sensitivity of an optical system to design or manufacturing flaws to be assessed by 
correlating the differential changes of the reflected or refracted rays with the differential changes in the incident 
rays. Thus, the effect of each optical boundary surface on the overall ray path within the optical system can be 
systematically examined. Current commercial software for the analysis and design of optical systems use finite 
difference (FD) approximation methodology to estimate the gradient matrix of a ray with respect to the system 
variables. However, FD estimates are intrinsically inaccurate and are subject to a gross error when the 
denominator is excessively small with respect to the numerator. Lin and Tsai [8] avoid these problems and 
determine these gradients by the application of Snell’s law. They provide information on the background and 
basics for determining the first-order gradients of skew rays of optical systems. Using these gradients, the 
differential vector of any ray can be estimated by determining the product of the developed gradient matrix and 
differential changes in the system variables. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis enables the construction of 
fundamental aberration functions, which greatly simplify the optical design task [9, 10]. Lin and Liao [11] 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensitivity analysis approach by using a Jacobian matrix and the 
Newton-Raphson method to determine the path of the chief ray in a binocular stereovision system. Sensitivity 
analysis also enables the orientation of an image to be accurately determined. For example, by considering a 
prism design for illustration purposes, Tsai and Lin [12] applied the results of sensitivity analysis to construct a 
merit function describing the change in the orientation of an image as it was successively reflected/refracted at a 
series of flat boundary surfaces.  
In many ways, the procedure used to design an optical system resembles that employed to design a 
mechanical machine tool. In the same way that optical systems comprise a structured series of optical elements,

Following refraction (reflection), the light ray proceeds with point iP  as its new point of origin and iV  
as its new unit directional vector. We have illustrated how the path of the reflected or refracted ray relative to a 
single cylindrical boundary surface can be found. We can apply this approach successively to trace rays relative 
to a series of optical elements that possess only cylindrical boundary surfaces. 
3. ERROR ANALYSIS FOR CYLINDRICAL LENS 
In optical systems, errors inevitably occur between the designed position and orientation of the optical 
elements and their actual position and orientation. In analyzing these errors, the relative positions and 
orientations of 0(xyz)  with respect to the ideal frame i(xyz)  and the actual frame a(xyz)  can be expressed, 
respectively, as

reflection occurs at a small value of 0yP  for the incoming ray [ ]Too0 0sin150cos15V = . Figure 6 illustrates

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Numerical Simulation Results 
Table 1 compares the results obtained from the FDM 
and DTM&FDM for the orbits of the rotor center. It is 
observed that a good agreement exists between the two sets 
of results. Moreover, it can be seen that while the FDM 
method suffers numerical divergence at low values of the 
rotor mass and time step, the DTM&FDM method 
converges under all the considered conditions and therefore 
represents a more appropriate method for analyzing the 
nonlinear dynamic response of the EGBS.   
Table 2 compares the Poincaré map data calculated by 
the DTM&FDM method using different time step values, H~ , 
for bearing number values, respectively. For a given rotor 
mass and bearing number, the rotor center orbits are in 
agreement to approximately 4 decimal places for the 
different time steps, H~ .

B. Dynamic Orbits 
Fig. 2.1(a)-2.6(a) show that the dynamic orbits of the 
rotor center are regular at a low value of the bearing number 
(ӛ=2.02), but become irregular at ӛ=2.19. At a bearing 
number of ӛ=2.44, the rotor center resorts to a regular 
periodic motion. When the bearing number is increased from 
3.73 to 3.78, the orbits still exhibit a periodic characteristic. 
However, for higher bearing numbers of ӛ=4.36, the rotor 
center performs an irregular motion. Fig. 2.1(b)-2.6(b) show 
the phase trajectories of the rotor center at different values of 
the bearing number. It is observed that the results are 
consistent with those shown in Fig. 2.1(a)-2.6(a) for the rotor 
center orbits, namely a regular motion at ӛ=2.02, 2.44, 3.73, 
and 3.78, but a non-periodic motion at ӛ=2.19 and 4.36. 
C. Power Spectra  
Fig. 3.1(a)-3.6(a) and 3.1(b)-3.6(b) show that the rotor 
center performs a sub-harmonic motion with a period of 2T 
at a bearing number of ӛ=2.02. However, when the bearing 
number is increased to ӛ=2.19, the power spectra (Fig. 
3.2(a)-3.2(b)) show that the rotor center performs quasi-
periodic motion in both the horizontal and the vertical 
directions. For values of ӛ equal to 2.44, 3.73, and 3.78, the 
orbits have a sub-harmonic characteristic with a period of T, 
2T, and 4T, respectively. Finally, for ӛ=4.36, the rotor 
center performs quasi-periodic motion.

IV. CONCLUSION 
This study has utilized a hybrid numerical scheme 
comprising the differential transformation method (DTM) to 
analyze the nonlinear dynamic behavior of an elliptic gas 
bearing system. The system state trajectories, Poincaré maps, 
power spectra, and bifurcation diagrams have revealed the 
presence of a complex dynamic behavior comprising
