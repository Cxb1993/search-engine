The battery managing controller (BMC) 
is implemented by a DSP module 
(TMS320F2812) in order to adjust the 
switching duty cycle during operations of 
the buck converter. The experimental results 
were compared with general CC/CV 
charging method. The results show 
favorable performance of the propose 
charging method. 
 
三、 計畫執行內容 
     
3.1 Models for a lithium-ion battery 
 
The electro-chemical behavior of a 
lithium-ion battery should are different for 
charging and discharging, to thus, to 
characterize battery completely, two models 
for charging and discharging should be 
prescribed. Figure 1 shows the complete 
models of a lithium-ion battery where u(t) is 
used to switch between charge and discharge 
mode. The proposed discharge model is 
similar to the Shepherd model [9] but can 
represent accurately the voltage dynamics 
with the battery current varying. The battery 
voltage obtained is given by 
*
0
exp( ),

Q QV E K it K i
Q it Q it
R i A B it

 (1) 
where Vbat is battery voltage; E0 is the 
battery open circuit voltage when fully 
charged; K is polarization resistance; Q is 
battery capacity; it is actual battery charge; 
A is exponential zone amplitude; B is 
exponential zone time constant inverse; R is 
internal resistance; i is battery current; i* is 
filtered current. The particularity of this 
model is to use a filtered current (i*) to flow 
through the polarization resistance. The 
open circuit voltage varies non-linearly with 
the SOC. This phenomenon is modeled by 
the polarization voltage term (the second 
term in Eq. (1)). Note also in Eq. (1) that 
different from Shepherd model, an 
additional term concerning the polarization 
voltage is added to better represent the open 
circuit voltage behavior, while another 
concerning the polarization resistance (the 
third term in Eq. (1)) is slightly modified. 
    In the charge mode, the voltage 
increases rapidly when the battery reaches 
the full charge that is modeled by the 
polarization resistance term in Eq. (1). The 
polarization resistance increases until the 
battery is almost fully charged (it = 0). 
Instead of the discharge model from Eq. (1), 
the polarization resistance for charge mode 
is now given by 
. .QPol R K
it
           (2) 
The polarization resistance increases 
abruptly when the battery almost reached 
fully charged status. Form Eq. (2), the 
polarization resistance is infinite when the 
battery is fully charged. That is not possible 
in a real battery. In fact, the contribution of 
the polarization resistance is often deviated 
in reality by about 10% from the full 
capacity of the battery. Thus, the 
polarization resistance in Eq. (2) can be 
rewritten to 
. .

 (4) 
To this point, the charge and discharge 
models are successfully obtained. The 
associated charging method with 
temperature compensation is designed and 
presented in the next section. 
 
3.2 Charging method 
 
    The proposed charge method consists 
of three different stages, i.e., constant 
current (CC), pulse charging and floating 
(trickle) charging, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In 
the CC mode, a big current is used for fast 
charging as 2C or bigger one. The 
temperature of battery normally rises rapidly 
in this mode. In order to avoid large 
temperature rise that possibly damages the 
battery, the pulse charging mode is adopted 
subsequently to slow down temperature rise 
while maintaining relatively fast charging 
speed. To prevent battery damage by 
 5
limit the output voltage under 3V. This 
avoids the breakdown of the analog to 
digital channel (an ADC) of DSP 
(TMS320F2812). In addition, an external 
circuit, a temperature-sensing circuit, is used 
to sense the battery temperature 
continuously in an on-line fashion, as shown 
in Fig. 6. The temperature sensor AD590 is 
a 2-terminal integrated transducer that 
produces an output current proportional to 
absolute temperature. This AD590 acts with 
a high impedance that offers 1μA per an 
increment of 1oK. V1 is seen as an output of 
a voltage divider with AD590, thus, 
1 1(273.2 ) .V A T R       (11) 
A voltage follower is subsequently used to 
transfer V1 to V2, which also overcomes 
effects of load variation. Finally, the output 
Vo is amplified by a difference amplifier 
circuit by 
3

( ) .o ref
RV V V
R
         (12) 
By the above design, the output voltage 
increases by 50mV when the temperature 
rises by 1℃ using the designed temperature 
sensing circuit. 
 
3.3.2 Experiment results 
 
In order to find the appropriate 
charging frequency, duty cycle of switching 
for the designed buck converter is fixed 
while recording the battery temperature, 
charge time and discharge time in difference 
frequencies. The results with duty cycles of 
60%, 70%, 80% and 90% are considered 
and shown in Fig. 7. Note that the charge 
current is 2A. The charge time, low 
temperature and charge capacity (equivalent 
to discharge time in Fig. 7.) are all 
considered conditions to the best switching 
frequency of the converter. Those results 
show that the charge capacity in low 
switching frequency (60-240Hz) is higher 
than high switching frequency (500-1kHz) 
as also for the discharge time. Considering 
all experimental data presented in this figure, 
240Hz appears to be the best frequency. The 
comparison between methods of the 
designed pulse charging and baseline fixed 
pulse charging are shown in Table 1. In the 
designed pulse charging method, the initial 
charge duty (Tc) is 90% for reducing the 
charging time. By Eq. (5), the charge duty is 
reduced to slow down the battery 
temperature increase. 
Integral results for battery charging are 
shown in Fig. 8 of which charge current for 
constant current is 3A. The voltage curve is 
seen as a typical one experiencing modes of 
constant current (CC) charge, pulse charge 
and trickle charge/discharge. It is also seen 
from this figure that the total charge time is 
close to 5 hours. The temperature resulted 
from the proposed charging method is lower 
than a general CC/CV method. The above 
proposed charging scheme successfully 
contains battery temperature as shown in Fig. 
8(b). 
 
四、 結論 
 
    A buck DC-DC converter with a 
function of temperature compensation of a 
battery charger is proposed in this study. 
The proposed temperature compensation 
model with the pulse charging method is 
used to achieve fast charging and contain the 
temperature rising. Experiments are carried 
out to validate the expected performance of 
the designed BMC controller and the buck 
converter. It is shown that a fast battery 
charging is well achieved with the chosen 
charge frequency 240Hz, while the 
temperature can be contained effectively 
with the designed pulse-charging method. In 
the charging process, the designed system 
with the proposed BMC and charging 
method is proven working effectively 
towards battery fast charging and 
temperature compensation.

Dynamic Modeling of a Traveling-wave Type Ultrasonic Motor 
with Beam Teeth via Finite Elements 
 
Abstract 
The study is dedicated to establish the dynamic model of a traveling-wave type ultrasonic motor 
(USM) with beam teeth via finite elements. The modeling is accomplished mainly by finite 
elements, the task of which consists of three parts — for stator, rotor and contact. It is first assumed 
that the complex dynamics of the stator emulates a single one-dimensional Euler-beam vibrating 
harmonically in the transverse direction. On the top surfaces of the stator are vertical beam teeth that 
is in contact with rotor, which is simply a thin disk fixed to spindle. The friction between the teeth 
tips and stator rotates the spindle moves the stator and finally rotates the disk to the desired speed. A 
contact model between beam tips and rotor disk with proper friction assumed is next built in 
conjunction with the established finite element model of the rotor disk. With a complete model in 
hands, the dynamics of the USM is predicted along with associated exerted torques. Experiments are 
finally conducted for collecting sets of data of rotation speeds versus torques that validate the 
effectiveness of the built models for the motor, stator and contact force.

WASHINGTON DC
Formerly the District of Columbia, Washington DC is the capital
of the United States and was founded on July 16, 1790.  The
US Constitution allows for the creation of a special district to
serve as the permanent national capital.  The District is therefore
not part of any US state and is instead directly overseen by the
federal government.  Within the District, a new capital city was
founded in 1791 and named in honor of George Washington.
The City of Washington along with Georgetown, and outlying
areas within the federal district, were placed under a single,
unified government following an act of Congress in 1871.  It is
for this reason that the city, while legally named the District of
Columbia, is known as Washington DC.  The city shares its
name with the US state of Washington located on the country’s
Pacific coast.
The District is located on the north bank of the Potomac River
and is bordered by the states of Virginia to the southwest and
Maryland on the other sides.  The city has a resident population
of 601,723; because of commuters from the surrounding
suburbs, its population rises to over one million during the work
week.  The Washington Metropolitan Area, of which the District
is a part, has a population of nearly 5.6 million, the seventh-
largest metropolitan area in the country.
