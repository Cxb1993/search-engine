Start-Up of Slot Die Coating. 
Y. R. Chang, C.F. Lin and T. J. Liu, Polym. Eng. Sci., 49, 1158 (2009). 
Abstract: 
A flow visualization technique was employed to observe the 
start-up of slot die coating. The effects of five variables, i.e., 
prewetting on the die surface, fluid viscosity, slot gap, coating 
gap, and die lip length on the start-up time were investigated. 
Prewetting on the die surface can effectively reduce the start-up 
time. Any variable that enlarges the steady-state coating bead 
would increase the start-up time. Therefore, increasing the fluid 
viscosity, coating gap, slot gap and decreasing the die lip length 
can be helpful in reducing the start-up time. It was found that 
there exist four distinct modes for the establishment of 
steady-state coating bead. The four distinct modes can be 
distinguished by a Reynolds number, which is defined as the 
ratio of the inertial force of the coating solution impinging on the 
moving web to the viscous force needed to pull the coating 
solution on the web. Comparison of the experimental observation 
with the theoretical prediction based on the commercial package 
Flow3D was also performed; the four modes can be found in the 
numerical simulations, the start-up time computed to reach 
steady state is shorter.

 Comparison of Vertical and Horizontal Slot Die Coating. 
16 
 
The effect of bead vacuum on the minimum wet thickness obtained 
on horizontal and vertical slot die coatings was experimentally 
examined using a flow visualization technique. The commercial 
software package FLOW-3D was used to simulate the 
two-dimensional coating flow. Macroscopic material balances were 
applied to estimate the effect of bead vacuum. Applying vacuum on 
the coating bead was found to reduce the minimum wet thickness and 
increase the maximum coating speed, with the effect on horizontal 
slot die coating being more pronounced. Visual observations revealed 
that with increasing vacuum, the upstream meniscus against the 
moving web was pulled back significantly for a low-viscosity 
solution, and the dynamic contact angle was reduced for a 
high-viscosity solution. The observed upstream wetting length for a 
low-viscosity solution subject to bead vacuum was consistent with 
the prediction using macroscopic balances. The sizes of coating 
beads predicted by FLOW3D were generally larger than those 
observed from flow visualization. Coating failures caused by high 
bead vacuum could be predicted with the aid of numerical 
simulations.

Abstract: 
Among various coating processes, slot die coating belongs to a

weight and degree of hydrolysis of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on 
the coating window of PVA suspensions of TiO2 and SiO2. 
Measurements of steady shear viscosity, surface tension, and 
amount of PVA adsorption on particle surfaces of different 
suspensions, together with observations of coating bead by 
means of a flow visualization technique, were used to analyze 
the coating flow behavior. Changing the pH of the suspension 
affects both the surface tension and the amount of PVA adsorbed 
on the particle surface. While surface tension and degree of PVA 
adsorption were found to increase with increasing pH for the 
TiO2 suspensions, opposite effects were observed for the SiO2 
suspensions. The coating bead was found to be more stable for 
suspensions with higher values of surface tension and PVA 
adsorption, thus delaying the occurrence of air entrainment. Four 
different PVA with varying molecular weight and degree of 
hydrolysis were used in the suspensions. Higher degrees of 
hydrolysis resulted in an increase in polymer adsorption, and 
hence larger surface tension. By contrast, higher molecular 
weight PVA resulted in a higher viscosity and a smaller surface 
tension, thus causing air entrainment to occur at a much lower 
maximum coating speed. 
(C) Slot die coating of dilute suspensions.  
 Y. T. Lin, W. B. Chu and T. J. Liu, Asia-Pac. J. Chem. Eng., 4, 125 (2008). 
 Abstract: 
    An experimental study was carried out to investigate slot die 
coating of dilute suspensions. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) 
particles of different sizes were added to glycerol solutions as 
test fluids. The coating flow experiment was performed on a lab 
coater. The operating window, which is a domain in which only 
a stable and uniform coating solution is possible, was determined 
experimentally. It was found that adding particles has little effect 
on the physical properties of glycerol solutions, as only the fluid 
viscosity increases slightly. Two coating defects are commonly 
observed; ribbing which is caused by flow instability refers to 
lateral waves on the coated surface, and air entrainment which 
implies that air bubbles are trapped in the coating solution. 
Adding particles has little effect on the operating window if the

The fluid mechanics of stripe coating. 
Abstract: 
The fluid mechanics of narrow stripe coating for low-viscosity 
Newtonian solutions were investigated. It was found that the coating 
solution will expand laterally after emanating from the slot die 
channel at low coating speeds. As coating speed increases, the stripe 
width will contract until it is close to the slot channel width, then 
coating failure would appear. Three slot channel widths were tested, 
coating failure such as ribbing appears at high speeds for two larger 
slot channel widths. However, for the smallest channel width, the 
critical speed for coating failure to appear is much higher and the 
coating failure is not ribbing but the narrow stripe breaks periodically. 
The effects of each parameter on the coating width variation were 
examined and a universal correlation which involves Reynolds and 
Bond number was established to predict the coating width.  
A flow visualization technique was applied to observe the 
mechanism on how a narrow stripe breaks at high coating speeds. 
2-D and 3-D numerical simulations on coating flows were examined 
for a better understanding on the stability of narrow stripe coating.

is similar to that observed in blade coating. Furthermore, it was
found that applying a vacuum to the coating bead could effec-
tively reduce the minimum wet thickness if the coating gap
was small and the viscosity of the coating solution was low.
Carvalho and Kheshgi [14] developed a two-dimensional nu-
merical tool to investigate the slot die coating flow, and showed
that the dimensionless minimum wet thickness went through a
maximum and then decreased with increasing capillary number.
Liu [15] reported that for every coating solution there existed a
close coating window, presented as volumetric flow rate per unit
coating width vs coating speed, for slot die coating. This rep-
resentation of coating window was first adopted by Blake et al.
[16] for curtain coating. Other reported works on slot die coat-
ing include the work of Chu [17], who examined the effect of
gravity; Yang [3], who studied experimentally the edge effects
for discrete slot die coating; and Romero et al. [26], who an-
alyzed theoretically the effect of curvature of die edges. The
single layer slot die coating has been extended to simultaneous
two-layered coating by Yu et al. [19], Lu et al. [20], and Lin et
al. [21].
Flow visualization on the coating bead has been shown to
provide critical information on the stability of coating flow.
Schweizer [22] examined visually and provided excellent pho-
tos of slide coating flow. Sartor [23] presented some photos
taken in the coating bead region of the slot die coating. Yang [3]
examined the curvature of the upstream meniscus of coating
bead. Lin et al. [21] identified the interface for the two-layered
slide-slot coating.
As for non-Newtonian coating solutions, Ning et al. [24],
and Yang et al. [25] studied the effects of polymer additives
on slot die coating. Carvalho et al. [26] analyzed the effects of
elongational viscosity and fluid elasticity on coating behavior.
Chu et al. [27] studied the effects of adding inorganic particles
into polymer solutions.
Despite the significant progress in the understanding and de-
velopment of slot die coating technique, there are still many key
areas that need further study. For instance, Lee et al. [12] found
that as capillary number increased, the minimum wet thickness
would increase initially with capillary number, which is sim-
ilar to the behavior of dip coating, and would then level off
to a constant value with further increase in capillary number,
which is similar to that observed in blade coating [28]. By con-
trast, the blade coating region was not observed by Carvalho
and Kheshgi [14]. Instead, a new region, in which the min-
imum wet thickness decreased as capillary number increased
was discovered. Conventional slot die coating is usually car-
ried out with the slot die set horizontally or on a slight angle
pointed upwardly to purge the entrapped bubbles. Recently,
patch coating on a large piece of glass substrate has been de-
veloped as a key technology for the production of liquid crystal
display (LCD) panels. For the patch coating, the viscosity of
the coating solution is usually low and the slot die is set verti-
cally with the solution moving downward to coat on a moving
glass substrate. Yang et al. [18] found that the coating window
for the patch coating is identical to that observed for the slot
die coating under the same flow conditions, other than the edge
effects.
The aim of the present study is to experimentally verify
different regions of flow in slot die coating. In addition to
determining the minimum wet thickness as a function of die
geometry and fluid properties, a flow visualization technique
is applied to observe the positions and shapes of the upstream
and downstream menisci, which are critical to the stability of
the coating bead. As the present study is relevant to the pro-
duction of LCD panels, experimental conditions are chosen as
close as possible to the real situation, i.e., using model fluids
with low viscosity as coating solutions in a vertically fed, slot
die coater. In order to examine the validity and capability of the
numerical simulation of the two-dimensional steady flow be-
havior in the coating bead region, realistic values of the static
and the dynamic contact angles for upstream and downstream
menisci must be assumed [14]. Hence, these contact angles are
experimentally measured and presented in this study for future
theoretical analysis.
2. Experimental
Several dilute aqueous glycerin solutions were prepared as
test fluids. The physical properties of these fluids are listed
in Table 1. For practical applications, the viscosities of these
coating solutions were between 1.2 and 50 mPa s, which were
within the viscosity range (<20 mPa s) of industrial coating
fluid used for making optical films of advanced LCD panels.
The schematic diagram of the experimental coater and the
geometry of the slot die are shown in Figs. 1a and 1b. The
coating solution was pumped from the reservoir (E) through
a filter and then into the slot die (A). The slot die would de-
liver a thin and uniform liquid film onto a rotating, polished
steel roller (B). The solution was removed by squeegees (C)
and recycled for continuous observation. Coating flow experi-
ment was performed with the slot die located vertically on top
of the roller. In the current experimental setup, no vacuum sys-
tem was applied as it was deemed unnecessary for subsequent
flow visualization measurements. A detailed diagram of the gap
region between the die exit and the substrate (roller surface) is
shown in Fig. 2. The dimensions of the slot die and ranges of
experimental parameters are listed in Table 2.
The experimental procedure for the determination of the
minimum wet thickness for a given coating solution was the
same as reported previously [12]. Briefly, a coating solution was
prepared and then fed into the slot die at a constant flow rate q .
The coating (roller) speed V was slowly adjusted by means of

was connected to a TV box and a monitor. The image taken by
the camera was instantaneously displayed on the LCD screen
and recorded. The images of the upstream and downstream
menisci are essential for the analysis of the minimum wet thick-
ness of slot die coating and for the determination of static and
dynamic contact angles, as defined in Fig. 2.
3. Results and discussion
Previous works [12,14] have indicated that there exist three
possible regions of minimum wet thickness in slot die coat-
ing when presented as the dimensionless coating thickness t =
h/H vs capillary number Ca ≡ (μV )/σ , as shown in Fig. 4.
Defect-free coating is possible only when the coating operation
is performed above this curve. In Region I, the coating thickness
increases with increasing Ca. This behavior is consistent with
that of “dip coating” as theoretically predicted by Ruschak [9].
Region II is similar to that of “blade coating” [28] where t is
independent of Ca. Region III shows that further increase in Ca
results in a reduction of coating thickness. This phenomenon is
similar to a liquid jet impinging on a moving substrate. Previ-
ous studies have reported the existence of Regions I and II [12]
or Regions I and III [14], but no one has so far observed the
co-existence of all three regions in slot die coating. Hence,
a systematic study was carried out here to examine whether
or not there existed the three minimum wet thickness regions
in slot die coating, as well as the experimental conditions un-
der which these regions appeared and their corresponding flow
mechanisms.
The effects of the physical properties of coating solutions
and the geometric parameters on the minimum wet thickness
were studied first. Fig. 5 shows the effect of fluid viscosity on
the minimum wet thickness. It can be observed that Regions I
and II can co-exist for solutions with higher viscosities such
as the 81 and 74% glycerin solutions (viscosities of 50 and
25 mPa s, respectively). As the solution viscosity drops to about
5 mPa s, Region I disappears, and Regions II and III take over.
Finally, only Region III appears when the viscosity of the coat-
ing solution is approaching that of pure water. The two curves
in Fig. 5 showing only Region III represented the 39 and 12%
glycerin solutions having viscosities of 3 and 1.2 mPa s, respec-
tively. The decrease of the minimum wet thickness with fluid
viscosity was also observed by Lee et al. [12]. It should be noted
that when the viscosity is low, the inertial force is more impor-
tant than the viscous force in the determination of the minimum
wet thickness.
The effect of the coating gap H on the minimum wet thick-
ness h is displayed in Figs. 6a and 6b. For the fluid with viscos-
ity μ = 7 mPa s, reducing the coating gap reduces the minimum
wet thickness as shown in Fig. 6a, For the larger coating gap,
H = 0.0002 m, both Regions I and III appear as the coating
speed increases, with no evidence of Region II. However, as
the coating gap H reduces to H = 0.0001 m, the minimum
wet thickness becomes nearly constant with increasing coating
speed. Hence, only Region II can exist in this case. As seen in
Fig. 6b, the effect of the coating gap is insignificant for very low
Fig. 4. Three coating regions: I—dip coating region, II—blade coating region,
III—jet coating region.
Fig. 5. The effect of viscosity: L = 0.001 m, W = H = 0.0002 m, (E) μ =
50 mPa s, (2) μ = 25 mPa s, (P) μ = 5 mPa s, (Q) μ = 3 mPa s, (") μ =
1.2 mPa s.
viscosity fluid (μ = 1.2 mPa s), and only Region III is observed
for the three different gap spacings.
The effect of the die lip length L on the minimum wet thick-
ness h is shown in Fig. 7. For the high and moderate viscosity
fluids (μ = 50 and μ = 5 mPa s), the minimum wet thickness h
is reduced by decreasing the lip length, but does not change the
shape of the thickness curve. That is, the same wet thickness re-
gions exist for the same coating fluid regardless of the die lip
length. Again, for the low viscosity fluid (μ = 1.2 mPa s), only
Region III exists and the effect of L is negligible.
The effect of the slot gap W on the minimum wet thickness
h is shown in Fig. 8. It is seen that the wet thickness is de-
creased by reducing W for the high viscosity coating solution
(μ = 50 mPa s), but the wetting regions remain the same for the
two slot gaps. For the solution with viscosity μ = 10 mPa s,
reducing W shifts the minimum wet thickness h from Re-
gion II to Region I. The effect of slot gap size on the wet
thickness is quite pronounced for the low viscosity coating so-
lution (μ = 1.2 mPa s). Reducing W from 0.0002 to 0.0001 m
changes not only the value of h, but completely shifts the coat-
ing region from Region III to Region II.
The results presented above are based on the experimental
recording of the minimum wet thickness. The images of the
coating bead, particularly the positions of the upstream and
downstream menisci, can provide valuable information on the
appearance of the three regions. The shapes and positions of the

downstream and upstream menisci determine the minimum wet
thickness and the type of coating defects, respectively. These
are illustrated in the photographs shown in Figs. 9–11, which
display the images of the coating bead obtained at different gaps
and coating velocities. For clarity, the coating die configuration
was superimposed on the photographs, although the dimensions
of coating die slot and gap were not drawn to scale. Fig. 9
shows the positions and shapes of the upstream and downstream
menisci obtained for two different values of H . Several criti-
cal geometric points around the die exit region are defined in
Fig. 2. Referring to Fig. 2, coating defects will occur if Point C
is attached to the die lip between Points D and E, and the type
of defect is determined by the shape of the meniscus. Ribbing
will occur if the upstream meniscus is concave; whereas air
entrainment will occur if the meniscus is convex and the dy-
namic contact angle approaches 180◦. If the position of Point C
crosses Point E and extends outside the die lip, the coating bead
will no longer be stable. In this case, break lines coupled with
dripping will appear. The position of the downstream meniscus
attached to the slot die can be used to determine which of the
three regions the minimum wet thickness falls into it. Region I
usually exists if Point A is on the downstream side slope of the
die and the distance A–B is not small. Once Point A approaches
Point B, and the distance of A–B is small enough but not nec-
essarily zero, then Region II will appear. Finally, when Point A
moves beyond Point B and is attached to the die lip between
B and G, then Region III will exist. The images of the menis-
cus for the two cases presented in Fig. 6a are shown in Figs. 9a
and 9b. For the case of the larger coating gap (H = 0.0002 m),
the downstream meniscus shown in Fig. 9a corresponds to the
minimum wet thickness identified as Point 1 in Fig. 6a. In this
case, the meniscus is outside the die lip region, since Point A is
attached to the slope of the downstream die. It is apparent from
the photograph that there exists a large pool of liquid in the
downstream region. This scenario is similar to that observed in
dip coating. Hence, the minimum wet thickness belongs to Re-
gion I. As the coating gap becomes smaller (H = 0.0001 m),
the position of Point A moves closer to the sharp corner of
the downstream die lip (Point B), and the liquid pool becomes
smaller. The minimum wet thickness obtained at this condition
is represented by Point 2 in Fig. 6a, which is in Region II. It is
interesting to note from Fig. 9 that the height of the meniscus d
appears to be directly proportional to the gap spacing H .
Fig. 10 shows the effect of the coating speed on the mini-
mum wet thickness in Region II. Figs. 10a and 10b correspond
to the conditions at Points 3 and 4 in Fig. 8, respectively. As
seen in Fig. 10a, the downstream meniscus is just outside the
die lip region for V = 1.0 m/s. It seems that there is very lit-
tle change in the position of the downstream meniscus as the
coating speed increases to V = 1.52 m/s, as seen in Fig. 10b.
This implies that the minimum wet thicknesses obtained at
these coating speeds are both in Region II. The images shown
in Fig. 11 correspond to the conditions of Points 5 and 6 in
Fig. 8, with both points lie in Region III. It can be observed
from Fig. 11a that the downstream meniscus is withdrawn into
the die lip region at low speed (V = 1.12 m/s). As the coat-
ing speed increases, the positions of both menisci change and
move closer to the slot gap. This is illustrated in Fig. 11b for the
case where V = 6.53 m/s. As a result, the liquid jet impinged
on the moving substrate is narrower and stronger. Hence, the
minimum wet thickness is further reduced. It should be pointed
out that although the coating speed in Fig. 11a is almost the
same, and the coating liquids are identical as with the two cases
shown in Fig. 10, the shape and position of the menisci are sig-
nificantly different. This is due to the effect of the slot gap, i.e.,
W = 0.0001 m in Fig. 10 and W = 0.0002 m in Fig. 11.

The theoretical analysis presented by Carvalho and Kheshgi
[14] assumed that the downstream meniscus is always fixed at
the corner of the die lip, or Point B in Fig. 2. This clearly is not
the case from the present experimental observations. In order to
numerically simulate the flow field in the coating bead region,
it is necessary to input values of the static and dynamic contact
angles, θs1 and θd. When the dynamic contact angle θd is close
to 180◦, air-entrainment will occur; whereas when θd is less
than 90◦, then ribbing will appear. Instead of using arbitrarily
assumed values for static and dynamic angles, the real values
can be estimated from the photographs shown in Figs. 9–11,
with the aid of the software package “Autocad.” The resulting
values of θs1, θs1, and θd are listed in Table 3. Clearly, these
angles are not constant, depending on the flow condition, die
geometry and fluid properties. Because the viscosities of the test
solutions are relatively low, the coating defects observed below
the minimum wet thickness are primarily “ribbing” and “break-
lines.” These findings are consistent with the measured dynamic
contact angles (listed in Table 3) where no air-entrainment is
observed when θd is much less than 180◦.
4. Conclusions
An experimental study has been carried out in a slot die
coater to examine the behavior of the minimum wet thickness
obtained under varying conditions. Dilute aqueous glycerin so-
lutions of varying concentration were used as the test fluids.
There exist three regions of wet thickness. The occurrence of
any or all of these regions is strongly dependent on the fluid
viscosity, as well as the geometrical dimensions of the slot die.
There exists a critical Reynolds number Re∗, below which Re-
gions I and II prevail, with the dimensionless wet thickness
increasing with capillary number in Region I, and independent
of Ca in Region II. Above Re∗, the wet thickness is predom-
inantly controlled by fluid inertia, and the thickness decreases
with increasing Re in Region III.
The coating bead was observed by means of a flow visual-
ization technique in order to identify the positions and shapes
of the upstream and downstream menisci. The position and
shape of the upstream meniscus determines the type of coating
defects. The coating bead is not stable if the upstream menis-
cus lies outside the die lip region, and defects such as drip-
ping coupled with breaklines will appear. On the other hand,
two types of defects could appear if the upstream meniscus is
within the lip length: ribbing if the meniscus is concave and
the dynamic contact angle is less than 90◦, or air-entrainment
if the meniscus is convex and the dynamic contact angle ap-
proaches 180◦.
The position of the downstream meniscus may also be used
to determine various coating regions. When the meniscus lies
on the sloping side of the die, but far away from the corner, the
minimum wet thickness follows the behavior of dip coating in
Region I. When the position of the meniscus is closer to the cor-
ner point, the coating behavior is similar to that of blade coating
in Region II. Finally, when the location of the meniscus is on
the base (flat side) of the die lip, the flow is in Region III and the
inertial effect is dominant. In practice, when the position of the
downstream meniscus is not controllable, coating solution that
stays outside the downstream die lip may cause streaks, slugs or
other coating defects. Flow visualization measurements reveal
that, under this condition, a pool of liquid exists outside the
downstream die lip region. This information would be useful to
industrial practitioners in slot die coating. Using low surface en-
ergy materials [29] may also prevent the downstream meniscus
from moving outside the die lip area.
Present study also reveals that the static and dynamic contact
angles vary with fluid properties as well as die geometry. Hence,
one must be careful in carrying out numerical simulation by
arbitrarily assuming constant static and dynamic contact angles.

age Flow3D1 is made, and a mechanism of start-up is
proposed.
EXPERIMENTAL
The ﬂow experiment was carried out in a laboratory-
scale coater. The schematic diagram of the experiment
set-up is shown in Fig. 1. The coating solution was
pumped from the storage tank (E), after passing through a
ﬁlter (F), to ﬁll up the slot die (A). A uniform and thin
liquid sheet emanating from the slot die exit was depos-
ited vertically downward onto a moving chrome-plated
steel roller B. The coating solution was removed by two
squeegees (C) and returned into a collection tray (D) for
recycling.
The ﬂow visualization device and set-up is displayed
in Fig. 2. A microscope with a magnifying power 64
(Model SZ-6045, Olympus) was positioned between the
slot die exit and the moving roller, focusing on the coat-
ing bead bounded by the upstream and downstream
menisci. The microscope was connected to a CCD camera
(EX-F1, Casio) to record the images of the ﬂow ﬁeld.
Proper lighting from both sides of the slot die was neces-
sary to catch a sharp image of the coating bead. The
lighting should be both from the X1-direction and from
the X2-direction (vertically downward), the focusing plane
on the coating bead was located at 0.05 m deep from the
side, photo images of the coating bead would remain the
same with different focusing depths as long as the edge
effects can be avoid. The camera can take 300 frames per
second, so each photo was taken at a time step of 0.0033
s. The quality of the photos taken on the coating bead
was further improved with Photoshop and AutoCAD.
Aqueous glycerin solutions were used as test ﬂuids.
Fluid viscosity and surface tension were measured using a
Brookﬁeld DV-III viscometer and a surface tensiometer
(CBVP-A3, Kyowa Kaimukagako), respectively. Fluid
density was measured by a pycnometer. All the measure-
ments were taken at 258C.
A careful preparation is needed for the commencement
of the ﬂow experiment. For a given ﬂow rate, a proper
coating speed was selected such that steady and uniform
coating could be established ﬁrst with a preset coating
gap, then the slot die was lifted. The pump was still
delivering the coating solution at a ﬁxed rate but a three-
way valve would direct all the solution delivered by the
pump to a collection tray at the same time, meanwhile
the coating solution still ﬁlled up the interior of the slot
die and the slot. The slot gap had to be small enough
such that the coating solution would not drip out of the
slot die exit even when there was no inﬂow into the slot
die. On the other hand, when the slot die was lifted, the
coating solution remained on the roller surface had to be
removed completely, and then the slot die would descend

A commercial software package FLOW3D was employed
to solve the time-dependent ﬂow problem numerically.
The algorithm was based on ﬁnite volume method [24,
25]. A typical mesh is displayed in Fig. 5; the ﬂow do-
main is divided to a large number of square cells with
side length 1.0  105 m. The downstream length is
selected long enough to satisfy boundary condition (E).
There are totally 21,600 cells in this calculation.
Three types of input variables are needed for numerical
simulation, i.e., (1) physical properties of coating solution
such as ﬂuid viscosity, density, surface tension, and the
static contact angle between the coating solution and the
web, the angle has to be measured experimentally. (2)
Geometric variable such as slot gap, coating gap, and die
lip geometry. (3) Operating variables such as input ﬂow
rate and web speed. FLOW-3D will generate numerical
solution in terms of coating bead shape, velocity, and
pressure ﬁelds at each time step.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The physical properties of the test ﬂuids are listed in
Table 1. The effects of ﬁve variables, i.e., prewetting,
ﬂuid viscosity, coating gap, die lip length, and slot gap on
the start-up process, particularly the time required to
reach the steady-state operation, were examined. A series
of photos were taken for each case to watch the variation
of coating bead during the transient state. Because of the
large quantity of images recorded, only a sample of repre-
sentative photos are presented here. The effects of the ﬁve
variables on the start-up time are given in Table 2.
The term ‘‘prewetting’’ refers to the condition when
the two die lips and the downstream lip corner surface
AB as shown in Fig. 3 are wetted with the coating solu-
tion before the commencement of coating. Cases A-1 and
A-2 in Table 2 correspond to coating without and with
prewetting, respectively. The time sequence on the devel-
opment of coating bead for Case A-1 is displayed in Fig.
6a–d. Without prewetting, it takes 0.3927 s to reach the
steady state, which is deﬁned as the variations of the two
geometric parameters d and X are less than 5% from con-
secutive photo images. Values of the wet coating thick-
ness are around 100 lm, considering the tolerance of
machine tooling precision and minor operational adjust-
ments, it is reasonable to take the maximum variation to
be 5%, or 5 3 1026 m, as the criterion of reaching steady
state. It appears that the downstream meniscus developed
faster than the upstream meniscus. The photos of Case A-
2 with prewetting are displayed in Fig. 6e–h; comparing
the expanding liquid pendant drop at the slot exit in Fig.
6a–d with that in Fig. 6e–h, it is noted that the drop
expands much faster with prewetting. The shape of the
coating bead at steady state is the same as that in Case
A-1; however, the time required to reach steady state is
only 0.2508 s, which is considerably shorter than the case
without prewetting. A previous study [26] reported that
prewetting of the moving substrate can increase the
curtain coating speed substantially. The slot die surface
including die lips and extended wall AB as shown in Fig.
3, not the moving substrate, was prewetted in this study,
the major function of prewetting here is to lower the sur-
face energy required to wet the die surface and reduce the
start-up time. Because prewetting can lower the surface
energy required to wet the surface and reduces the start-
up time, subsequent experiments were all performed with
prewetting.
The effects of other variables on the start-up time can
be summarized in Table 2. The size of the steady coating
bead determines the time required to reach steady state.
Any variation of ﬂuid properties and physical dimensions
that decreases the size of the coating bead will reduce the
time required to reach steady state. The results indicate
that increasing the ﬂuid viscosity reduces the time
required to reach steady state, because the coating bead is
smaller for more viscous solution. It is also seen that
increasing the slot gap W, coating gap H and decreasing
the die lip length L reduce the size of the coating bead,
and consequently shorten the time required to reach
steady state.
In industrial applications, one of the most important
details required in slot die coating is the minimum wet
thickness. It has been shown (Lee et al. [8] and Chang
et al. [17]) that the size of the steady-state coating bead

lar conclusions can be drawn by comparing the theoretical
predictions with the experimental results for Modes B and
C, and D, as shown in Figs. 8–10. It is noted that the
computed start-up time for Mode B is much shorter than
that observed experimentally. This discrepancy can be
explained by the photo shown in Fig. 8c. It is observed
that the coating bead in the upstream area may vibrate
during the transient stage; this may be due to minor me-
chanical disturbances of coating operation and cannot be
detected by numerical simulation. Therefore, variations of
coating bead shapes from Fig. 8c and d appear to be more
signiﬁcant than those appeared in Fig. 8g and h based on
numerical simulations. Similar result was found for Mode
C, the computed start-up time is shorter than that
observed experimentally. The photo in Fig. 9b indicates
that ﬂow may be slightly unstable during the start-up pro-
cess. Variations of coating beads from Fig. 9c and d also
appear to be more signiﬁcant than those in Fig. 9g and h.
Comparison for Mode D is displayed in Fig. 10; the dom-
inant inertial force seems to be able to overcome minor

mechanical disturbances as observed in Modes B and C,
the computed start-up time and the size of coating bead
are close to those observed experimentally.
The shape of the coating bead can be observed experi-
mentally through the ﬂow visualization technique. On the
other hand, detailed ﬂow ﬁeld such as velocity and pres-
sure proﬁles can only be simulated with FLOW3D. We
may use a case for illustration. Figure 11 presents the ve-
locity proﬁle for the case in Fig. 7g, the arrows represent
velocity distributions and the length of each arrow repre-
sents the magnitude of the velocity. It is noted that the
coating solution is ﬂowing back against the moving sub-
strate in the slot exit region. Signiﬁcant variations of ve-
locity vectors appear near the upstream meniscus and the
ﬂow is making a turn near the downstream die lip corner.
The corresponding pressure ﬁeld for Fig. 11 is displayed
in Fig. 12. The atmospheric pressure is assumed to be
zero, so the pressure inside the coating bead is below the
atmospheric pressure and the numerical values are nega-
tive. Strong pressure variations appear near the upstream
meniscus and the downstream die lip corner.
The effects of different variables on bead size and
start-up time under different modes of operation are pre-
sented in Tables 3 and 4. There are three competing
forces, i.e., surface tension, viscous force to pull the solu-
tion deposited on the moving substrate, and the ﬂuid iner-
tia impinging on the moving substrate for the coating
ﬂow. Two dimensionless groups, i.e., capillary number Ca
and Reynolds number Re can be deﬁned as follows:
Ca ¼ mVw
s
(14)
Re ¼ rV
2
s
mVw=H
(15)
Capillary number represents the ratio of the viscous drag
force the on moving web to surface tension. Reynolds
number represents the ratio of the inertial force of the
coating solution emanating from the slot exit to the vis-
cous drag force exerted by the moving web on the coating
solution. In practice, surface tension usually varies
between 25 and 65 mN/m. On the other hand, web speed
Vw and ﬂuid viscosity m can vary in a large range to ﬁt
production needs. Variations of the coating thickness can
be expressed in terms of capillary number provided the
inertial force is less important, or Re is smaller than unity
[8, 12]. Values of Ca for different cases were computed
and listed in Table 4; apparently there is no clear correla-
tion between Ca and the four modes.
Chang et al. [17] found that, at steady state, the dimen-
sionless minimum wet thickness S  hH is a strong func-
tion of Reynolds number, and the functional relationship
can be divided into three regions. In Region I, S goes up
with increasing Re; S is independent of Re in Region II,
and in Region III, S decreases as Re is increased. The
boundary between Regions I and II occurs at Re of
around unity, and between Region II and Region III at Re
of around 20.
The appearance of different modes depends on the
competing effect between the inertial force at the slot exit
and the drag force on the moving web. If the inertial
force is negligible as the case of Region I, Re is small
and viscous force is competing with surface tension on
the establishment of a steady coating bead. The minimum
wet thickness is thinner than that in other regions and the
coating bead is relatively small. If the coating speed is
zero, the coating bead will be symmetric to the center line
of the slot. A slow web velocity Vw has little effect on
varying the upstream meniscus, which is established by
the surface tension, but the coating solution is pulled out
of the coating gap. Therefore, Mode A appears which
indicates it takes longer for the downstream meniscus to
reach steady state. As Re increases (Region II), the iner-
tial force tends to expand the coating bead in both the
upstream and downstream directions, whereas the viscous
force pulls all the coating solution toward the web mov-
ing direction. The effect of inertial force is balanced by
the opposing viscous force in the upstream region, result-
ing in a longer time for the upstream meniscus to reach
steady state. Mode B is just a transition between Mode A
and C because the increased inertial force will extend the
time required for the upstream meniscus to reach steady
state. As Re is around unity, the inertial force is equiva-
lent to the viscous force and both menisci reach steady
state with the same time, consequently Mode B appears.
Because the inertial force tends to increase the wetting
distance of the coating bead, the steady-state coating
beads in Region II are usually larger than those in
Region, hence a longer start-up time is required in this
Region. Increasing Re further, the inertial force will be
dominant and Mode C appears, which implies that the
time required for the upstream meniscus to reach steady
state is longer than that of the downstream. As the inertial

Abstract 
 
Comparison of vertical and horizontal slot coatings was carried out 
experimentally using aqueous glycerin solutions with varying viscosity on a 
laboratory-scale slot coater. The maximum coating speeds achieved in vertical 
slot coating were found to be higher than those of horizontal slot coating for 
low-viscosity solutions. The coating defects observed below the minimum wet 
thickness changed from ribbing to air entrainment at a critical solution viscosity 
of around µ=75mPaዊ�s. Above this critical viscosity, a lower minimum wet 
thickness was obtained for the horizontal coating but not for vertical coating. 
The difference between vertical and horizontal coating was mainly the length of 
the coating bead. The dimensionless minimum wet thickness was correlated as a 
function of Reynolds number. There existed three regions of minimum wet 
thickness depending on Reynolds number. Initially, the dimensionless wet 
thickness increased in the low Reynolds number region (Region I), then reached 
a plateau in the intermediate Re region (Region II), finally dropped off sharply 
in the high Re region (Region III).The boundaries of these three regions were 
identified by two critical Reynolds numbers, i.e., Re=1 and 20. Only Regions I 
and II of the wet thickness could be found for horizontal coating, while mainly 
Regions II and III were obtained for vertical coating, depending on the viscosity 
of the coating solution.

was based on the dip coating theory of Levich and Landau[8]. Later, Higgins 
and Scriven[9] extended Ruschak’s work to include the viscous effect in the 
coating bead. Kheshgi and Carvalho[10] developed a two-dimensional 
numerical model to simulate the slot coating flow.  
Following the methodology of Gutoff and Kendrick[11], Lee et al[12] 
carried out an experimental study on slot die coating to examine the minimum 
wet thickness, or the low flow limit, of slot die coating. The maximum coating 
speed and the minimum wet thickness can be evaluated from the coating 
window. The maximum coating speed is defined as the critical coating speed, 
above which no good coating is possible. The minimum wet thickness at a fixed 
coating speed can be evaluated from the lower boundary of the coating window, 
below which no stable and defect-free coating is possible. They found that there 
exists a critical capillary number, below which the minimum wet thickness 
increases with increasing capillary number, and becomes independent of 
capillary number beyond the critical value. Subsequently, Carvalho and Kheshgi 
[13] found that there exists a third region at relatively high capillary numbers 
where the minimum wet thickness decreases with increasing capillary number. 
More recently, the three minimum wet thickness regions were analyzed by 
Chang et al [14] using a flow visualization technique on the coating bead. 
Other published works on slot die coating include the effects of polymer 
additives and inorganic particles in coating solutions [15,16], and the analysis of 
two-layered slot die coating[17,18]. More details on the fundamentals of slot die 
coating technology can be found in several text books[19,20,21]. 
Previous studies have not paid much attention to the difference between 
vertical and horizontal slot die coating. Chu [22] and Liu[23] reported some data 
on the effect of application angle on slot die coating. Gutoff and Cohen[24] also

given solution was the same as in previous studies[12,14]. For a given solution, 
the flow experiment started at a very low volumetric flow rate, and the coating 
speed was gradually increased until a stable and uniform coating on the roller 
was observed. In most cases, two coating speeds which defined the lower and 
upper boundaries for the stable and uniform coating of a particular flow rate 
could be identified. The procedure was repeated for different flow rates, adjusted 
by a pump controller(G) until a maximum coating flow rate was reached where 
no further stable and uniform coating could be found. 
A coating window is usually constructed by plotting the volumetric flow 
rate per unit coating width q against the coating speed V, as shown schematically 
in Fig.3(a). Usually a closed window can be found for a particular coating 
solution. Alternatively, coating window can also be presented by plotting the 
minimum wet thickness h against the coating speed V as indicated in Fig.3(b). 
The minimum wet thickness h can be computed from the lower boundary of the 
coating window shown in Fig.3(a) with the formula hHq/V over the coating 
speed range Vmin to Vmax.
In order to observe the fluid motion in the coating bead region, a flow 
visualization device was installed, as shown in Fig.4. A digital camera 
(Nikon-4500) attached to a microscope having a magnifying power of 64x 
(Olympus, SZ6045) was positioned at the side of the coating bead to take the 
image of the flow field. The microscope/camera system was connected to a TV 
monitor so that the image of the coating bead could be displayed on the LCD 
screen and recorded. The photographic images were focused and taken at a 
depth of approximately 2 cm into the coating bead from the side to avoid the 
edge effect.

and hence stabilizes the coating bead. In the case of low speed, a stable coating 
bead can only be maintained at higher flow rates for vertical coating. It is noted 
that at high coating speeds, the pulling effect on the upstream liquid is less 
effective for horizontal coating and the gravitational effect is more favorable for 
vertical coating. As a result, the maximum coating speed is higher for vertical 
coating. Furthermore, reducing the coating gap decreases the minimum wet 
thickness. All coating defects observed under the minimum wet thickness were 
of ribbing type. Ribbing refers to the onset of lateral waves on the coating 
surface, which is caused by flow instability in the coating bead region. The 
photographic images of ribbing can be found in the papers of Lee et al[12] and 
Yang et al [24].  
The effect of reducing the slot gap W on the minimum wet thickness for the 
same solution is shown in Fig.6(b). It appears that smaller slot gap would reduce 
the maximum coating speed for both horizontal and vertical slot coating, and the 
maximum coating speed for the same slot gap is higher for vertical coating than 
horizontal coating. Reducing the slot gap will increase the fluid inertia at the die 
exit for the same flow rate, which will destabilize the coating bead at high 
coating speeds. While Region I was observed in both horizontal and vertical 
coatings, there was no Region ዊ� for the small slot gap in vertical coating. As 
seen in Fig.6(a), with the smaller slot gap H= 100 µm, the horizontal coating 
yields the thinnest minimum wet thickness at low coating speeds. It is evident 
that unless the minimum wet thickness falls in Region III where the effect of the 
coating gap is negligible, reducing the coating gap would stabilize the coating 
bead in both vertical and horizontal coatings.

coating usually has a higher maximum coating speed than that of horizontal 
coating, owing to gravitational effect. The trend continues as fluid viscosity 
increases until a critical value, around 75 mPa.s, is reached, above which 
horizontal coating may be advantageous in terms of minimum wet thickness. 
When this critical viscosity is reached, the coating defects change from ribbing 
to air entrainment. 
 It is useful to examine the flow behavior in the coating bead regions in 
order to provide a better understanding of the stability of the coating bead. 
 Figure 10 exhibits the photos of coating bead for vertical slot coating with 
µ=5 mPaዊ�s at a constant volumetric flow rate of Q=1.6x10-6 m3/s in the 
sequence of increasing coating speed V. It is observed that a relatively large and 
stable coating bead exists at low coating speed V=1.12m/s. As the coating speed 
increases, both the upstream and downstream menisci move toward the die exit 
and the size of coating bead shrinks. Fig.10(d) displays the stable coating bead 
just prior to the appearance of coating defects, the upstream meniscus moves 
closer to the slot exit and the curvature of the downstream meniscus increases.  
Comparisons of coating beads for vertical and horizontal slot coating at the 
Q=9x10-6m3/s and V=1.51 m/s for the fluid with µ=5 mPaዊ�s are displayed in 
Fig.11(a) and (b). At this coating speed, the coating bead in vertical coating is 
quite stable, as seen in Fig.11(a); while the coating bead for horizontal coating is 
smaller and the upstream meniscus is very close to the edge of the die exit, as 
depicted in Fig.11(b). The coating defects appearing beyond the maximum 
coating speed are ribbing for both vertical and horizontal coating. 
 The shapes of coating bead for a high-viscosity solution (µ=200 mPaዊ�s) in 
horizontal coating are displayed in Fig.12. It is observed as the coating speed

lip corners. The downstream meniscus could extend outside the die lip region, 
causing the appearance of vortices[23].  
There are basically four forces that can influence the stability of the coating 
beadዊ�
I. Fluid inertia at the die exit, FI= 2sPV : Depending on the value of FI, it 
may either expand the coating bead and assist flow stability at 
moderate FI, or may destabilize the coating bead at very high FI.
II. Viscous force in the coating bead, Fv=
Vµ
H
: This is the force 
required to pull the liquid in the coating bead onto the moving web. 
III. Gravitational forces, Fgv=PgH for vertical coating, and Fgh= bPgL for 
horizontal coating: Due to the length of the coating bead, Lb=1600µm, 
for horizontal coating being larger than the coating gap H in vertical 
coating, the effect of gravity is more significant for the latter. 
IV. Surface tension force, Rዊ�The effect of surface tension on the stability 
of the coating bead may be expressed in terms of the pressure 
difference across the upstream meniscus by the Laplace equation, 
RSP=
H
. Larger pressure drops can help stabilizing the coating bead 
[8]. 
The difference between vertical and horizontal slot coating can be 
demonstrated by plotting the wet thickness against the Stokes number (St), 
which is the ratio of gravitational to viscous forces, or the ratio Reynolds to 
Froude numbers.  
For horizontal coating, the Stokes number Sth is defined as

vertical slot coating windows are much larger than those of horizontal slot 
coating for low-viscosity solutions. As seen in Figure 15, there exists a unique 
relationship between t and Fr for vertical coating, but not for horizontal coating. 
The boundary between vertical and horizontal slot coatings appears at Fr of 
around 500.  
The results in Figs. 14 and 15 demonstrate the variations of fluid inertia and 
viscous force on the coating window. Hence, an attempt is made to correlate the 
wet thicknesses obtained in both vertical and horizontal slot coatings with 
Reynolds number Re. According to Chang et al[13], the fluid inertial force for a 
coating solution emanated from the slot die exit is critical in coating flow, and 
Reynolds number is better presented as the ratio of the fluid inertia at the slot 
exit to the viscous drag force on the moving web,

It is to be noted that the definition of Re involves two characteristic velocities: 
the fluid velocity in the slot and the web velocity.  
Figure 16(a) displays the dimensionless minimum wet thickness t as a 
function of Reynolds number Re for both horizontal and vertical slot coatings. It 
is evident that there is no unique relationship existed between t and Re. However, 
this figure can be used to identify the boundaries of the three wet thickness 
regions similar to those shown in Fig.5 as a function of Re instead of Ca. The 
relationship between t and Re can be expressed as

viscosity solutions. Above this critical viscosity, values of the minimum wet 
thickness are smaller for horizontal slot coating than those of vertical slot 
coating.  
 Irrespective of liquid viscosity, the coating bead shrinks as the coating speed 
increases and the upstream meniscus moves very close to the slot exit before the 
appearance of coating defects. The main differences between the low and high 
viscosity liquids are the dynamic contact angle and the coating defects, i.e., the 
dynamic contact angle are less than 180ዊ� and the defect is ribbing for low 
viscosity solutions as compared to 180o and air entrainment for high viscosity 
solutions. At high coating speeds, vertical coating is more stable than horizontal 
coating for low-viscosity solutions, but the reverse is true for high-viscosity 
solutions. 
The forces acting in the coating bead region are analyzed in terms of 
various dimensionless numbers. Comparison of Stokes numbers for vertical and 
horizontal slot coatings indicates that the gravitational effect is smaller than the 
viscous effect. The effect of gravity appears to be more important for horizontal 
slot coating. The gravitational force effectively pulls down and stabilizes the 
coating bead to prevent air entrainment. On the other hand, comparison of 
Froude numbers indicates that vertical slot coating is able to withstand a much 
higher fluid inertia for stable coating. 
There exist three regions of minimum wet thickness depending on 
Reynolds number. Depending on the slopes of the curves in the t vs Re plot, the 
critical Reynolds numbers which mark the transition from Regions I to II, and 
from Regions II to III were found to be at Re of around 1 and 20, respectively. 
For moderate and high viscosity fluids, stable coating can only occur in Regions

The Effect of Bead Vacuum on Slot Die Coating
The effect of bead vacuum on the minimum wet thickness ob-
tained on horizontal and vertical slot die coatings was experi-
mentally examined using a flow visualization technique. The
commercial software package FLOW3D was used to simulate
the two-dimensional coating flow. Macroscopic material bal-
ances were applied to estimate the effect of bead vacuum. Ap-
plying vacuum on the coating bead was found to reduce the
minimum wet thickness and increase the maximum coating
speed, with the effect on horizontal slot die coating being more
pronounced. Visual observations revealed that with increasing
vacuum, the upstream meniscus against the moving web was
pulled back significantly for a low-viscosity solution, and the
dynamic contact angle was reduced for a high-viscosity solu-
tion. The observed upstream wetting length for a low-viscosity
solution subject to bead vacuum was consistent with the pre-
diction using macroscopic balances. The sizes of coating beads
predicted by FLOW3D were generally larger than those ob-
served from flow visualization. Coating failures caused by high
bead vacuum could be predicted with the aid of numerical sim-
ulations.
1 Introduction
In coating industry, it has been a constant challenge to produce
thinner coating film for many products. For example, one such
product is the liquid crystal display (LCD) panel which con-
tains multi-layer films such as anti-glare, anti-reflection and
hard coat films. These layers of coating are very thin, in the
range of hundred nanometers, and can only be fabricated by
precision coating technology. To produce such thin coated pro-
ducts, the wet coating thickness has to be proportionally thin-
ner. To date, micro-gravure coating appears to be one of a few
popular and mature methods that can produce such thin wet
coating film. However, this type of coating is usually being
carried out in open atmosphere, pollution and unpredictable
solvent evaporation can cause serious environmental and
health problems. In addition, undesirable gravure patterns
may appear on the coated surface for certain products.
On the other hand, conventional slot die coating is per-
formed in a closed environment and can produce defect-free
coating film. However, it is extremely difficult to deliver uni-
form wet coating thickness less than 10 to 20 lm, as required
for the production of optical films. Several advanced technolo-
gies based on direct extension of the conventional slot die coat-
ing have been developed.One of these is the tensionedweb slot
die coating (Shibata and Sato, 1992; Takahashi and Shibata,
1993; Feng, 1998; Lin et al., 2007). The major difference be-
tween the tensioned web and conventional slot die coatings is
that in the tensioned web coating, the slot die is positioned
and delivers the coating solution onto a flexible moving web
instead of depositing the coating solution on the substrate
attached to a rotating metal backing roller as in the operation
of most conventional slot die coatings. Another extension of
conventional slot die coating is the so-called vacuum-assisted
slot die coating, in which a vacuum is applied in front of the
die exit during the coating operation. Applying a small amount
of suction behind the coating bead appears to stabilize the coat-
ing flow. This process is known as “bead vacuum”. The tech-
nology of bead vacuum is not new, and was introduced as early
as 1954 by Beguin. It was claimed that applying a slight suc-
tion with a vacuum box installed beneath the coating bead
might be able to stabilize the coating bead and increase the
maximum coating speed. Later, Brown and Maier (1997) sug-
gested that introducing a vacuum slot at the slot die exit to pro-
vide suction was a better option than using a vacuum box un-
derneath the coating bead as originally suggested by Beguin.
It is difficult to operate the coating machine with a vacuum
box attached to it, particularly if the application angle of the
slot die has to be changed due to varying production require-
ments.
Several researchers have examined the performance of slot
die coating theoretically. Ruschak (1976) first applied a lubri-
cation approach to determine the operating window, which is
a closed region for stable operation of slot die coating. Later
Higgins and Scriven (1980) extended the lubrication theory
by including the viscous effect. Carvalho and Khegshi(2000)
applied two-dimensional finite element method to simulate
the flow field in the coating bead region and predicted the oper-
ating window.
Lee et al. (1992) adopted the methodology of Gutoff and
Kendrick (1987) on slide coating and carried out an experimen-
tal study to examine the minimum wet thickness of slot die
coating. The minimum wet thickness is defined as the lowest
coating thickness possible for stable and uniform coating of a
solution at a specific coating speed, before the appearance of
coating defects. As it is difficult to produce thin coating in slot
die coating, the information on the minimum wet thickness
provides a useful guide to production practitioners. Lee et al.
(1992) et al also found that the minimum wet thickness for
dilute solution coating could be reduced by 20 to 30% if bead
vacuum was applied. Recently, Chang et al. (2007a) found that

studies (Lee et al., 1992; Chang et al., 2007b).Usually two lim-
iting coating speeds Vmin and Vmax could be found for a parti-
cular coating solution. Coating defects were detected outside
these two velocity limits.At any speed betweenVmin andVmax,
a uniform and stable coatingwas established first, then the flow
rate was gradually reduced until a critical thickness was
reached, below which stable and uniform coating was no long-
er possible. This critical thickness is defined as the minimum
wet thickness at that coating speed. The experiment was re-
peated for other roller speeds between Vmin and Vmax. to deter-
mine the minimum wet thickness as a function of roller speed.

Since vacuum in the coating bead was created by a vacuum
pump, the maximum bead vacuum in the present study was
limited to 2 kPa. The amount of air being sucked into the va-
cuum slot was monitored by a flow-meter.
A flow visualization technique was employed to observe
the flow behavior in the coating bead region. The shapes and
positions of the upstream and downstream menisci for a
specific coating condition were closely monitored. The sche-
matic representation of the flow visualization device is dis-
played in Fig. 3. A microscope with a magnifying power 6X
(Olympus, SZ6045) was positioned between the slot die and
the moving roller, with the focal plane located around 5 cm
into the coating bead from the side to avoid edge effects.
The images were transmitted to a LCD screen for observation
and recording. In order to catch sharp images, it was critical to
provide proper lighting from both sides of the coating bead as
shown in Fig. 3.
3 Numerical Solution
The coating flow in the coating bead region, as shown in
Fig. 2A, can be considered as two-dimensional, isothermal, in-
compressible and steady flow. The simulation can be solved
numerically by the commercial software package FLOW3D
(Flow Science Inc.). FLOW3D is based on finite difference
method and the free surface positions are determined by the
volume-of-fluid approach. Detailed description of the numeri-
cal method can be found elsewhere (Brethour, 2005; Hirt
et al.,1981, 1997, 1999). A typical mesh is displayed in Fig. 4.
The flow domain was divided into 20,000 square cells, with
the length of each cell side equal to 10 lm. The downstream
length has to be long enough to ensure rectilinear flow. Three
sets of input parameters are required for the numerical scheme.
The first set is the physical properties of the coating solution
including the fluid viscosity, density, surface tension and the
measured static contact angle between the coating solution
and the web. The second set is the geometric parameters in-
cluding the coating gap, slot gap and the die lip geometry.
The third set includes the operating variables such as coating
speed and flow rate. To simplify the analysis, the air flow field
was not included in the simulation; instead a pre-set bead va-
cuumwas specified at the upstream boundary. In practice, bead
vacuum was set at few inches of water only.
4 Macroscopic Balances
Macroscopic material balances in the coating bead region can
be useful is explaining the physics of coating flow. The analy-
sis was based on the lubrication approximation and only vis-
cous forces were involved. It is noted that in the present study,
the maximum Reynolds numbers for air flow in the vacuum
slot and in the die lip region were estimated to be around 90
and 100, respectively, where inertial force could be important.
Hence, the analysis based on macroscopic material balances
can only yield the lower bound solution. Its validity can only
be confirmed by comparing with the experimental results.
The predictions of coating bead size for vertical and hori-
zontal coating was first compared. The pressures at various po-
sitions in the coating gap region are labeled in Fig. 2C. The
volumetric flow rate QL in the slot is:

imum coating speed effectively. The effect of coating gap on
the minimum wet thickness of the same solution is displayed
in Fig. 6. The results are consistent with previous studies (Lee
et al., 1992; Chang et al., 2007b), which reported that decreas-
ing the coating gap could stabilize the coating bead and conse-
quently reduce the minimum wet thickness and increase the
maximum coating speed. The present study shows that the
same effects can be achieved by applying bead vacuum. How-
ever, the effects are less significant for the case with a large
coating gap H = 300 lm.
The experimental results on both vertical and horizontal slot
die coating operations with bead vacuum are summarized in
Table 3. The minimum wet thicknesses at various maximum
coating speeds are presented as functions of fluid viscosity,
bead vacuum and length of the vacuum slot. It is observed that
for the low-viscosity solution (l = 3MPa s), the minimum wet
thickness obtained in vertical slot coating is thinner than in hor-
izontal slot coating, while the opposite is obtained for the high-
viscosity solution (l = 120MPa s). These findings are consis-
tent with those reported in the previous study (Chang et al.,
2007a). Because the coating bead is usually smaller in horizon-
tal slot die coating, the effect of bead vacuum is more signifi-
cant in pulling the upstream meniscus to stabilize the coating
bead, resulting in a reduction of the minimum wet thickness.
The dimensionless minimum wet thickness (t = h/H) has
previously been found to be a function of a modified Reynolds
number Re* (Chang et al., 2007a; Chang et al., 2007b), which
is defined as
Re> 0 qV
2
s
l
V
H
: ð17Þ
Here Re> represents the ratio of the inertial force of the coating
solution impinging on the moving substrate from the slot exit
to the viscous force required to pull the coating solution on
the moving substrate. In the present study, an additional dimen-
sionless group representing the effect of bead vacuum is neces-
sary. This group is defined as
P> 0 DPH
r
: ð18Þ
Fig. 7A and B show the effects of Reynolds number Re> and
the dimensionless pressure P> on the minimum wet thickness
for the two coating solutions. It is evident that over a wide
range of Re>, the minimum wet thickness reduces with increas-
ing bead vacuum for both cases. The trends shown in these
figures are consistent with the findings of Chang et al.
(2007a), in which the vertical coating is more favorable for
low-viscosity solutions, and horizontal coating is preferable
for high-viscosity solutions.
The images of the coating bead obtained through the flow
visualization technique may provide some insight on the me-
chanism of bead vacuum. The photographic images of coating
bead for the low-viscosity solution obtained in horizontal slot
die coating at three different bead vacuum conditions are dis-

Table 3. Summary of critical results for the two coating solutions
dictions based on macroscopic balance and the experimental
measurements are less than 25% for the low-viscosity solu-
tion, and around 40% for the high-viscosity solution. The
photos shown in Fig. 10 suggest that the contribution of bead
vacuum on flow stability is mainly on changing the dynamic
contact angle. This feature can not be predicted by the macro-
scopic balance.
Table 5 lists values of the slopeM (Eq. 10) computed at var-
ious minimum and the maximum coating speeds for the
3MPa s solution. It is noted that values ofM are not only larg-
er, but their variations with the applied vacuum are also bigger
for horizontal slot die coating than those for vertical coating.
This indicates that bead vacuum in horizontal coating is more
effective in terms of stretching upstream wetting length of the
coating bead, which provides a more stable flow condition.
This is also evident from the experimental results given in Ta-
ble 3. It is also noted that value of M becomes smaller as the
bead vacuum Ps increases. However, the relationship is non-
linear, and M appears to approach a plateau at high values of
Ps. This indicates that the efficiency of bead vacuum will be re-
duced at high Ps.
Comparison of the coating beads observed experimentally in
horizontal coating and those predicted using the FLOW3D
package are displayed in Fig. 11 for the 3MPa s solution at
V = 2.5 m/s. It is seen that the predicted coating bead is larger
than the one observed experimentally, or L2 is longer. This im-
plies the coating bead predicted by numerical simulation is
more stable than the one actually observed. This is reasonable
because minor mechanical vibration or mis-alignment of the
equipment that may destabilize coating flows can not be sim-

Abstract
Among various coating processes, slot die coating belongs to a class of pre-metered coating, in which the coating film thickness can be
predetermined. In the past, most research works on slot die coating have focused mainly on polymer solutions; very little information is available
using suspensions as coating fluids. In this study, the effect of adding TiO2 and SiO2 in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solutions on slot
die coating is investigated. It was found that the stable coating window was enlarged with the addition of particles, and its size increased with
solids concentration. This is due to the strong interaction between polymer and particles, resulting in a higher viscosity and surface tension.
As a result, the upstream coating bead is more stable and the maximum coating speed is extended to a high value, hence the coating window
becomes larger. Although both viscosity and surface tension appear to contribute to the stability of coating flow, the effect of surface tension is
more dominant. The surface tension of a suspension with porous particles was higher than one with hard solid particles. Consequently, the coating
window obtained with the former was significantly larger than the latter. Flow visualization revealed that under the same operating conditions, the
upstream dynamic contact angle for the suspension was smaller than for the aqueous polymer solution. This observation could be related to the
stability of the upstream coating bead, and hence the coating window. The experimental flow fields were verified numerically with the aid of a
numerical simulation package (Flow-3D).

1. Introduction
Previous studies on slot die coating have focused mainly on
Newtonian and polymer solutions. Very few have dealt with
suspensions on slot die coating. Inorganic particles are fre-
quently added to solutions to improve a particular character-
istic of the coating products. Currently, many industrial coating
products contain solid particles such as light diffusing backlit
film, anti-glare film, lithium battery, fuel cell, etc. In the present
study, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is chosen as the base fluid, since
it is not only hydrophilic, non-toxic, and easy to handle, but is
also an industrially important ingredient which is widely used
in coating industry such as in ink-jet media [1–4].

The stability of a uniformly dispersed suspension is de-
termined mainly by the relative magnitudes of various inter-
particle forces. These forces include Brownian, van der Waals,
electrostatic, steric, and hydrodynamic forces [5,6]. The pres-
ence of particles influences the rheology of the coating so-
lution, and hence its coating behavior. In general, increasing
the particle concentration increases the bulk viscosity of the
suspension. Einstein [7] was the first to develop the relation-
ship between viscosity and particle concentration. However, the
Einstein equation is only valid for very dilute suspensions. It
assumes that the suspending medium is Newtonian, and there
are no particle interactions. Subsequently, many researchers
have extended the Einstein equation or developed other semi-
empirical relations for highly concentrated suspensions, taking
into account the particle/particle interactions [8–10].
Numerous investigators have used TiO2 or SiO2 to study
suspension rheology, and found that the suspension behaves as

2. Theoretical formulation
Most of the early theoretical analyses on slot die coating
have been based on the lubrication theory to analyze the pres-
sure distribution in the fluid, and to predict the stability of the
coating bead region [20,21]. Later, Sartor [36] combined the
finite element method with the spine method to completely an-
alyze the flow field in slot die coating. The governing equations
of continuity and motion, together with the appropriate bound-
ary conditions used to analyze the coating bead behavior are
given below.
Fig. 1 is the schematic representation of the flow field be-
tween the die exit and the substrate. The two-dimensional gov-
erning equations of continuity and motion, expressed in dimen-
sionless form are given below,
(1)∇ · v = 0,
(2)Rev · ∇v − ∇ · T = 0.
They are solved simultaneously for velocity and pressure
distributions. For Newtonian fluids, the total stress is given by
T = −pI + ∇v + (∇v)T . Reynolds number, representing the
ratio of inertial to viscous forces, is defined as Re = ρVH/µ,
where ρ is the density, V is the roller speed, H is the coating
gap between the die exit and the substrate, and µ is the fluid
viscosity.
The boundary conditions as indicated by various numbers in
Fig. 1 are as follow.

In this study, a software package (Flow-3D) supplied by
Flow Science, Inc. is used to analyze the fluid behavior of the
coating bead in slot die coating. The Flow-3D package utilizes
a special numerical technique, taking into account the moving
boundary to accurately predict the position of the free surface.
The computational tool used in the package is based on the tech-
nique of volume of fluid (VOF). Not only has the package been
applied successfully in predicting coating flow, it is also widely
used for other fluid flow problems involving free surfaces.
3. Experimental
Since the purpose of the present study was to investigate the
effect of particle addition in PVA on slot die coating behav-
ior, a variety of particles of different sizes and structures were
used. These included hard spherical TiO2 (R700), manufac-
tured by Du Pont; porous SiO2 (C803 and C809), manufactured
by Grace Davison; and hard spherical SiO2 (1-FX and USV-5),
manufactured by Tatsumori. The physical properties of these
particles are tabulated in Table 1. Average diameters and densi-
ties were supplied by the manufacturers. A high-speed surface
area and pore size analyzer, manufactured by Quantachrome In-
struments, was used to measure the surface area of the particles.
The suspending medium, BP-2420 PVA (polyvinyl alcohol),
was supplied by Chang-Chun Petrochemical Co. The PVA as
supplied has a concentration of 20 wt%, a degree of hydrolysis
of 86–89%, average degree of polymerization of 2400–2500,
molecular weight of approximately 120,000, and a pH of 5–7.

4. Results and discussion
In this study, the effects of the rheological properties and
surface tension of suspensions containing different types, con-
centrations, sizes, and shapes or structures of particles in poly-
mer solutions on the stability of the coating bead in slot die
coating were examined. It is well known that, in general,
the viscosity of a suspension is higher than the suspending
medium, and it increases with increasing solids concentration.
At high solids concentration, the suspension may exhibit non-
Newtonian behavior, showing shear-thinning behavior or even
shear-thickening at certain critical shear rates, and may also
manifest a yield stress and time-dependent characteristic.
Figs. 4 and 5a show the viscosity versus shear rate curves
for different concentrations of TiO2 and SiO2 in 2.5% PVA
solution, respectively. It was found that, except for the sus-
pensions with higher solids concentrations (30% TiO2 and 7%
SiO2), all others behaved as Newtonian suspensions. The vis-
cosity was found to increase with increasing solids concen-
tration. The 30% TiO2 suspension exhibited a typical shear-
thinning behavior over the shear rate range of 10–1000 s−1;
while the 7% SiO2 displayed an anomalous phenomenon over
the same range of shear rates. The SiO2 flow curve exhibited a
shear-thickening behavior in the low shear rate region up to a

The effects of adding particles to PVA solution on the coat-
ing window are demonstrated in Figs. 8 and 9. The addition of
TiO2 and SiO2 particles can effectively expand the coating win-
dow. The size of the coating window increases with increasing

particles concentration. For each coating solution, it was possi-
ble to determine a close window. The coating windows at low
flow rates or at low coating speeds were left open in Figs. 8–12,

The porous particles have a larger exposed surface area than the
impervious particles for particles/polymer interactions. This is
indicated by the difference in their respective surface tension
values (see Table 3). The coating bead is more stable with sus-
pensions having a high surface tension, resulting in an extension
of upper limit of coating velocity.
So far, all experimental evidence has pointed to the im-
portance of rheology and surface tension in the determination
of the coating window. Since the addition of particles in the
coating solution causes both viscosity and surface tension to
increase, to assess the relative importance of these properties
on coating operations is not easy based on the observations ob-
tained so far. Hence, a new set of experiments was designed and
carried out. Fig. 11 shows the coating windows obtained with
an aqueous 3.5% PVA solution and the 30% TiO2 (R700) in
2.5% PVA suspension. The concentration of the aqueous PVA
solution was chosen such that the viscosity was approximately
the same as that of the 30% suspension (around 30 mPa s). The
surface tension of the aqueous solution was 0.0417 N/m com-
pared to 0.0486 N/m for the suspension. In this case, although
the surface tension increased only by about 16% with the addi-
tion of particles, the upper limit of the coating velocity for the
suspension was about 50% higher than the aqueous solution,
from 0.5 to 0.75 m/s.
To study the effect of viscosity, two solutions were made
with similar surface tension, but differing in viscosity. A model
suspension was prepared by adding a minute quantity of fluo-
rosurfactant (Zonyl, Du Pont) into the 15% TiO2 in 2.5% PVA
suspension to lower its surface tension to the same level as that
of the neat 2.5% PVA solution (around 0.042 N/m). Many re-
searchers have used dynamic surface tension to quantify the
interfacial activity, and have reported a higher dynamic surface
tension value than the static surface tension. Since the quantity
of Zonyl used in the suspension was extremely small (volume
fraction = 0.0001) and we had allowed a further 3 min after
the preparation for the Zonyl-added suspension to stabilize, the
static surface tension was chosen for comparison purposes with
the aqueous PVA solution. No discernible change in the viscos-
ity of the suspension with the addition of fluorosurfactant was
detected. As shown in Fig. 12, the maximum coating speed in-
creased only by about 20% for the suspension, from 0.47 to
0.56 m/s, even though the viscosity increase was about 33%,
from 11.5 to 15.3 mPa s. This result clearly demonstrates that
although both viscosity and surface tension have a positive ef-
fect on increasing the maximum coating speed, or expanding
the coating window, the role played by the surface tension is
more dominant. The importance of surface tension was also il-
lustrated in Fig. 10 when the data for porous SiO2 suspension
was compared with the hard SiO2 suspension. For the two sus-
pensions having similar viscosity (around 12 mPa s) but differ-
ing markedly in surface tension (0.0468 N/m for porous SiO2
and 0.0421 N/m for hard SiO2), the maximum coating veloc-
ity increased by about 37% from 0.45 m/s for the hard SiO2
suspension to 0.62 m/s for the porous SiO2 suspension.
The stability of the coating bead is influenced by a number of
forces acting in the flow field. The relative importance of these
forces is usually expressed in the form of dimensionless groups
Fig. 13. The dimensionless minimum wet thickness (t/H ) as a function of the
capillary number (Ca). The region above the master curve represents good coat-
ing, marked with OK; whereas the region below represents bad coating, marked
with NG (no good).
such as capillary number (Ca), Reynolds number (Re), Bond
number (Bo), and Weber number (We). In the present study,
the two major forces that appear to control the coating bead
stability are the capillary and viscous forces. Hence, the cap-
illary number, Ca = µV/σ , was chosen to analyze the coating
results. Fig. 13 shows the dimensionless film thickness, t/H , as
a function of Ca. It was found that at Ca < 0.1, the film thick-
ness increased with Ca to a power of about 0.5–0.7. This find-
ing is consistent with those reported by Ruschak [20] and Lee
et al. [23]. When Ca > 0.1, the dimensionless film thickness
became constant and had a value of around 0.6–0.7, indepen-
dent of Ca. The constant film thickness was maintained with
the aid of the upstream die lip serving as a blade of the coating
die [23,25].
The present system is different from the curtain coating sys-
tem used by Blake et al. [32]. Furthermore, the coating fluids
used by Blake were non-Newtonian shear-thinning. No hys-
teresis was observed at the upper speed limits as shown in
Figs. 8–12. Our study agrees with the recent findings of Yama-
mura et al. [29]. The addition of particles in the coating solution
could delay the occurrence of air entrainment and expand the
coating window. Yamamura used a particle size range between
8 to 50 µm and showed that the upper coating speed increased
initially with particle size and reached a maximum at a critical
size, then decreased with further increase in particle size. This
critical size is about 30 µm. The maximum particle size used in
the present study is 9 µm, which is well below the critical size.
Hence, the maximum onset velocity of air entrainment was not
observed in the present study.
In order to relate the coating flow stability to the struc-
ture of the coating bead formed between the die lip and the
substrate (roller surface), a flow visualization system was de-
signed and constructed to observe the flow structure of the
bead. The coating beads developed by the 15% TiO2 suspen-
sion and by the aqueous 2.5% PVA solution were observed
under the same operating conditions. The condition chosen is
represented by the symbol  as shown in Fig. 8. Under this
condition, the roller speed was V = 0.55 m/s and the flow rate
was q = 1.2 × 10−4 m3/(s m). This operating condition lies
outside the boundary of the coating window for the pure PVA
W.-B. Chu et al. / Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 297 (2006) 215–225 225
polymer chains. Consequently, stronger particle/polymer/par-
ticle aggregates were formed. The effect of surface tension on
the stability of coating bead and the maximum coating speed
was more dominant than the viscosity.
Capillary number was found to be the relevant dimensionless
number that affected the stable film thickness. When Ca < 0.1,
the dimensionless film thickness was proportional to about
0.5–0.7 power of Ca; while at Ca > 0.1, it became constant at
around 0.6–0.7, independent of Ca. The observation is consis-
tent with previous studies [20,23,25].
Flow visualization experiments confirmed that under the
same operating conditions, the upstream dynamic contact an-
gles obtained with the aqueous PVA solution and with the
suspension were different. The latter was found to be smaller,
resulting in a more stable coating bead. This suggests that addi-
tion of well-dispersed particles in solution greatly expands the
size of the coating window, and increases the maximum coat-
ing speed. The flow behavior of the coating bead was further
confirmed with the aid of a numerical simulation package. The
software package can be used to calculate the hydrodynamic
field in the coating bead under certain experimental conditions.

Abstract
Slot die coating technology is currently the most widely used method for production of optical films. The main advantages of this coating
method are its ability to pre-determine the product film thickness and to produce uniform film under prolonged operation. In the present study,
a laboratory-scale slot die coating equipment was used to investigate the effects of pH, molecular weight and degree of hydrolysis of polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) on the coating window of PVA suspensions of TiO2 and SiO2. Measurements of steady shear viscosity, surface tension, and amount
of PVA adsorption on particle surfaces of different suspensions, together with observations of coating bead by means of a flow visualization
technique, were used to analyze the coating flow behavior. Changing the pH of the suspension affects both the surface tension and the amount
of PVA adsorbed on the particle surface. While surface tension and degree of PVA adsorption were found to increase with increasing pH for the
TiO2 suspensions, opposite effects were observed for the SiO2 suspensions. The coating bead was found to be more stable for suspensions with
higher values of surface tension and PVA adsorption, thus delaying the occurrence of air entrainment. Four different PVA with varying molecular
weight and degree of hydrolysis were used in the suspensions. Higher degrees of hydrolysis resulted in an increase in polymer adsorption, and
hence larger surface tension. By contrast, higher molecular weight PVA resulted in a higher viscosity and a smaller surface tension, thus causing
air entrainment to occur at a much lower maximum coating speed.

1. Introduction
In recent years, many hi-tech industries have focused their
research and development on high performance materials. There

is a huge demand of hybrid organic–inorganic materials for
applications in flat panel display panels and long-life battery
productions. Many coating materials contain added particles
in polymers to produce value-added products. For example,
in the coating of light diffusing backlit film, TiO2 particles
are normally added in the PVA solution to produce a film
with high gloss, good light diffusion and uniform dimensions
[1,2].

various inter-particle forces. Particles tend to aggregate when the
van der Waal force of attraction is larger than the electrostatic
and/or steric repulsive force, and the suspension is not stable.
On the other hand, a well-dispersed suspension can be achieved
when the repulsive force is greater than the attractive force. Sus-
pensions generally exhibit shear-thinning characteristics, and
sometime yield stress depending on the particle concentration,
near the iso-electric point. Newtonian behavior prevails when
pH is remote from the iso-electric point [34,35].
Despite numerous studies on the adsorption and rheological
behavior of adding PVA in inorganic particle suspensions, very
little information is available on the coating behavior of these
polymeric suspensions. Chu et al. [36] found that the coating
window is enlarged with the addition of inorganic particles such
as TiO2 and SiO2 in PVA solutions, and the coating window size
increases with the solids concentration. The strong interaction
between particles and polymer appears to delay the occurrence of
flow instability to a higher coating speed. It was also shown that
the influence of surface tension is more dominant than the sus-
pension viscosity. The evidence was further supported with flow
visualization measurements. Since the stability of the coating
bead is paramount in achieving a good coating, many researchers
have attempted to relate the shapes of the upstream and down-
stream menisci of the coating bead to coating stability [37,38].
Yamamura et al. [39] observed a higher onset velocity of air
entrainment when PMMA particles were added to silicon oil,
but it was dependent on the particle number density. The onset
velocity appeared to reach a maximum at the particle diameter of
30m, and then decreased with further increase in the particle
diameter.
In the previous study [36], the effects of varying particle
concentration, size and surface area on slot die coating were
examined. In the current work, the effects of pH, the molecu-
lar weight and the degree of hydrolysis of PVA on the slot die
coating of TiO2 and SiO2 suspensions are presented. Physical
properties including shear-dependent viscosity, surface tension,
zeta potential and the degree of PVA adsorption are related to the
observed coating windows under different operating conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Two types of inorganic particles were used in the present
study, i.e., TiO2 and SiO2. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) particles
used in the present study are manufactured by Du Pont under
the trade name of R-700. The particles are of rutile-type and
have a 96% purity. They are hard, solid spheres, having an
average diameter of 0.34m and a specific surface area of
11.78 m2/g. Silica particles (SiO2), manufactured by Grace
Davison Co. under the trade name of C803, are of porous
structure. They have a mean diameter of 3.5m and a surface
area of 252.33 m2/g. The polymer used was polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA), supplied by Chang-Chun Petrochemical Co., Taiwan.
Four types of PVA (BP-04, BF-04, BP-24 and BF-24) with vary-
ing degrees of hydrolysis (86–99.2%) and molecular weights
(18,000–124,000) were studied. Their respective physical prop-
erties are tabulated in Table 1. TiO2 particles were first added
into reverse-osmosis (RO) water, and the mixture was stirred
for an hour at 2000 rpm using a high-speed mixer to ensure the
wettability of particles. A 20% aqueous solution of PVA was
then added to the TiO2 suspension until the desired concentra-
tion was reached. Mixing was continued for a further 6 h at low
stirring speed (100 rpm). The vessel containing the suspension
was sealed during mixing to prevent absorption or evaporation
of water.
2.2. Property measurements
The steady shear viscosity of the TiO2/PVA and SiO2/PVA
suspensions was measured over a shear rate range of 1–1000 s−1
using a Rheometric Fluid Spectrometer (RFS2). A concentric-
cylinder (Couette) measuring system, with a cup and bob
diameters of 34 and 32 mm, respectively, was used. All mea-
surements were carried out at 21 ◦C under a constant strain rate
mode. In order to ensure the same initial structure for all suspen-
sions, every sample was stirred for 5 min using a spatula in the
vessel, then loaded and rested for a further 5 min in the measuring
system before commencement of rheological measurement.
Surface tension was measured using a Kyowa Interface Sci-
ence (Japan) CBVP-A3 surface tensionmeter. The measurement
was based on the Wilhelmy Plate method. The platinum plate
used has a perimeter of 48 ± 0.14 mm. The instrument has
a measuring range of 0–200 dyne/cm, with an accuracy of
±0.1 dyne/cm. During the measurement, the temperature was
controlled at 25 ◦C using a circulated water bath.
The zeta-potential was measured using a zeta-potential
analyzer (DT-1200 by Dispersion Technology, Inc.). This instru-
ment applies the electro-acoustic principle to analyze the particle
diameter and its surface electric potential. The diameter range is
0.01–300m, and surface potential range is −200 to +200 mV.
The suspension pH was adjusted by adding either 1 M HNO3
or 1 M NaOH solutions. The range of pH studied was 4–10, as
measured by a digital pH meter.
The adsorption of PVA on the surface of TiO2 (or SiO2) was
carried out by first placing the suspension containing various

are well-dispersed in the medium, and the suspension exhibits
Newtonian behavior, as illustrated in Fig. 2 for the suspension at
pH 4.0. When the pH approaches its IEP, there is no electrostatic
repulsive force to counterbalance the van der Waal attractive
force, and particles tend to aggregate together to form clusters
or flocs. Suspensions of high solids concentration near the IEP
have been found to exhibit yield stress [34]. The shear-thinning
behavior, however, becomes more prominent as the value of pH
approaches the IEP. The shear-thinning effect diminishes as the
shear rate increases, and approaches a constant viscosity when
the shear rate is greater than about 1000 s−1. Under the slot die
coating conditions, the apparent shear rates, based on the oper-
ating roller speed and the gap between the die lip and the roller
surface, are within the range of 500–3000 s−1. Hence, a repre-
sentative constant value of viscosity taken at the shear rate of
1000 s−1 was used for subsequent analysis of coating results.
For suspensions containing polymer, the phenomenon of
polymer adsorption on particle surfaces in suspension has been
theoretically verified and widely used for creation of stable sus-
pensions. When PVA is adsorbed on the surfaces of TiO2, it
generates a steric stabilization repulsive force, which aids the
stabilization of the suspension system. The active sites on the
particle surface at which the polymer chains are attached are
known as the attachment points. The following ionization reac-
tions could take place at the TiOH sites on the particle surface
under different acidic or basic environments:
≡ TiOH + H+ ↔≡ TiOH2+ (1)
≡ TiOH + OH− ↔≡ TiO− + H2O (2)
According to these reactions, increasing pH results in a decrease
of TiOH2+ and an increase of TiO−, whereas TiOH tends to
increase initially and then decrease [23]. Since the adsorption
of PVA on TiO2 is primarily due to hydrogen bonding, the
amount of PVA adsorbed on the TiO2 surfaces increases sig-
nificantly as pH changes from 4 to 10, as shown in Table 2. The
increased adsorption could be due to the differences in polymer
chain conformations (curly or extended) under different solvent

environments, causing the adsorbed macromolecules to form
different network structures on the particle surface.
In this study, coating window is defined as the stable coating
region within which a uniform coating film is produced. It is
usually presented graphically either as a liquid flow rate versus
roller speed plot or a minimum wet thickness versus roller speed
plot. In principle, the coating window is a closed region within
which there should be no coating defects of any kind. How-
ever, due to the limitations of pump delivery and coater speed,
it is difficult to obtain a closed window at the lower speed end.
Several coating defects, including dripping, air entrainment and
break lines, have been observed during the course of the experi-
ment. The occurrence of these defects under different operating
conditions and their photographic images were presented in a
previous paper [36]. Fig. 4 is a schematic representation of a
coating window with the region inside represents good quality
coating and various coating defects indicated by arrows outside
the window boundary.
In order to investigate the effect of the pH of the coating sus-
pension on slot die coating, coating windows were measured
for five 15% TiO2 suspensions of different pH, and plotted in
both forms of coating window, i.e., q versus V, and t versus V,
in Fig. 5(a and b), respectively. The results shown in Fig. 5(a)
reveal that the suspension with pH 4.0 yields the smallest coating
window, and the coating window appears to attain its maxi-
mum size at pH around 7, followed by a small reduction with
further increase in pH. As pH changes from acidic to basic,
Fig. 4. Schematic of the four different flow regimes is represented graphically in
a “coating window” plot. The O.K. region represents good coating, () dripping,

adsorption sites (silanol groups) is expected to decrease with
increasing pH as indicated by the following reactions:
≡ Si-OH ↔≡ Si-O− + H+ (3)
≡ Si-ONa ↔≡ Si-O− + Na+ (4)
When the suspension changes from acidic to basic by adding
NaOH, the reaction in Eq. (3) proceeds to the right, whereas the
reaction in Eq. (4) favors the left. The OH− ions in suspension
convert the non-ionized silanol (≡Si-OH) into ionized silanol
(≡Si-O−), and the non-ionized silanol sites are replaced by Na+
to form ≡Si-ONa. Consequently, the number of adsorption sites
available for hydrogen bonding with PVA is decreased, resulting
in a smaller amount of PVA adsorbed onto the silica surfaces
[40]. Since the steric force is a result of polymer adsorption on
the particle surface, its effect would be weaker at high pH.
The position at which the polymeric chain is adsorbed onto
the particle surface is known as the attachment point. On the
point, the bonding between the PVA molecules and SiO2 is pri-
marily due to hydrogen bonding. In an acidic environment, the
silica surface is mainly occupied by non-ionized silanols, which
is conducive to PVA affinity. Hence, the amount of PVA adsorbed
is larger in an acidic environment. Furthermore, the surface ten-
sion is also higher at low pH and is able to sustain higher shear
stress. Both of these conditions are important in promoting the
coating bead stability. Fig. 7(a and b) shows the coating win-
dows for the silica suspensions at different pH. It is evident
from Fig. 7(a) that the size of the coating window or the maxi-
mum coating velocity for the silica suspensions increases with
decreasing pH.
The effect of molecular weight and hydrolysis of PVA on the
coating window was studied by using suspensions of 15% TiO2
in four different 2.5% PVA solutions. The degree of hydrolysis
of PVA is defined according to the relative quantities of hydroxyl
and acetate groups on the polymer chain. The four types of
PVA used in the present study were supplied by Chan-Chun
Petrochemical under the trade names of BP-04, BF-04, BP-24
and BF-24. Their physical properties are listed in Table 1. It is
noted from Fig. 8, that the 15% TiO2 suspensions with different
PVA are only marginally shear-thinning, except the BF-04 sus-
pension, and the viscosity increases with increasing molecular
weight. All suspensions approach a constant viscosity at high
shear rate. For PVA with the same molecular weight, the viscos-
ity of BF-24 is about 35% higher than that of BP-24. This is due
to the stronger hydrogen bonding between the TiO2 particles and
the polymer (BF-24) with a higher degree of hydrolysis (more
–OH group). To understand the mechanism of polymer adsorp-
tion on solid particle surfaces, it is important to consider the role
of the functional groups present in the polymer. For example, the
main function group in PVA is the hydroxyl group, but due to
the presence of a small residual of non-hydrolyzed acetate group
after polymerization, the adsorption of PVA on the TiO2 surface
is greatly influenced by the acetate group. Since the affinity of
the acetate group with TiO2 is greater than the hydroxyl group,
more segments of PVA chains will be attached to the particle
surfaces, resulting in a flatter conformation. By contrast, PVA
with a higher degree of hydrolysis contains less acetate groups,

and the adsorbed segments form loops and tails arranged perpen-
dicularly on the particle surface [22]. This allows more surface
area available for polymer adsorption, resulting in more BF-24
adsorbed on the TiO2 surfaces.

Fig. 10(a) shows the dimensionless film thickness (t/H) as
a function of capillary number (Ca). It is observed that at low
Ca, t/H increases with increasing Ca for the two high molecular
weight PVA suspensions. This behavior is similar to dip coat-
ing. When the coating speed approaches its maximum value,
the dimensionless film thickness becomes independent of Ca,
as evident for the suspension with higher degree of hydroly-
sis (BF-24). This behavior is similar to that of blade coating
previously reported [6,10]. However, the behavior of the low
molecular weight suspensions (BP-04 and BF-04) is completely
opposite. The film thickness was found to decrease with increas-
ing Ca, with its values falling between a narrow range of 0.15 and
0.30 over the range of Ca from 0.035 to 0.25. This is not unex-
pected since the viscosity and surface tension values for these
two suspensions are very similar, i.e., 3.78 mPa s as compared
to 3.84 mPa s, and 41.4 dyne/cm as compared to 44.1 dyne/cm,
respectively. The coating results are re-plotted in terms of t/H
versus Reynolds number in Fig. 10(b). It can be seen that the Re
range is much higher for the low viscosity suspensions. Under
these flow conditions, capillary number is no longer relevant, and
the coating bead behavior is controlled mainly by fluid inertia.
4. Conclusions
The effects of inorganic particles (TiO2 and SiO2) in aqueous
PVA suspensions on the stability of the coating bead in slot die
coating were investigated. Due to different surface chemistry,
TiO2 and SiO2 suspensions exhibited different zeta potential
behavior at different pH. When pH approaches its IEP, particle
surfaces are electrically neutral, and agglomeration of particles
occurs in suspension due because the inter-particle force is dom-
inated by van der Waal force of attraction. Dilute suspensions are
generally not stable near the IEP. When pH is remote from IEP,
electrostatic and steric forces take over, and particles are well-
dispersed, and dilute suspension exhibits Newtonian behavior.
In the present study, the size of the coating window increases
as pH increases for the TiO2 suspensions, but decreases for the
SiO2 suspensions. This is because the coating bead stability is
promoted not only by increasing the surface tension, but also
determined by the amount of PVA adsorption on the inorganic
particle surfaces. The larger the amount of PVA adsorbed, the
stronger are the steric forces surrounding the particles. These
forces are able to withstand higher stress fields in slot die coat-
ing, resulting in a higher suspension viscosity and an increase
in the maximum coating velocity.
In addition, the degree of hydrolysis and the molecular weight
of PVA also affect the coating behavior. Higher degree of
hydrolysis results in a larger surface tension and more adsorp-
tion of polymer onto the particle surfaces. As a result, coating
bead becomes more stable and the size of the coating win-
dow increases. The dimensionless film thickness increases with
capillary number and approaches a constant value for the high
molecular weight PVA suspensions, but is only a weak function
of Ca for the low molecular weight, low viscosity suspensions.
At high Reynolds number, the stability of the coating bead is
controlled primarily by fluid inertia instead of surface tension.

adding particles were studied recently by two groups.
Chu et al .[17,18] analyzed the effects of adding silica
and titanium oxide particles to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
solutions and found that owing to the adsorption of PVA
molecules onto the particles, the operating windows can
be effectively expanded. Yamamura et al .[19,20] exam-
ined a noninteracting particle-solution system. They
studied two different flow geometries; one is similar to
slot die coating and the other is a falling circular jet. A
small portion ofpolymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) par-
ticles was added to silicon oil and they found that the
onset of air entrainment can be postponed. The slot die
coating system in Yamamura’s experiment is somewhat
different from the actual setup. For example, the coating
bead region is too long and the driving force depends
only on hydrostatic pressure. In addition, ribbing also
appears as a serious and popular coating defect but the
effect of adding particles in ribbing was not examined.
In the present study, we shall examine the effect of
adding PMMA particles into Newtonian glycerol solu-
tions. The experimental slot die is similar to that in
actual production, and the effects of particles on the
onset of both ribbing and air entrainment are reported.

wetting of PMMA particle surfaces. The fully wetted
PMMA particles were then added to the diluted glycerol
solution, and the dilute suspension had to be stirred
continuously for at least 2 h before the coating flow
experiment. Since it is easy for glycerol solutions to
absorb moisture, the preparation of dilute suspension
had to be carried out in a closed environment. Usually,
10 kg of a suspension was prepared for one test run. The
coating flow experiment for one test solution has to be
completed within 2 h to avoid too much of moisture
getting absorbed into the dilute suspension. The slot
gap and coating gap for all flow experiments were
maintained at 2 × 10−4 and 3 × 10−4 m, respectively.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Glycerol solutions of three concentrations, 60, 80 and
90% were prepared as base solutions, and particles of
different sizes and concentrations were added to the
base solutions. The physical properties of the dilute
suspensions are listed in Tables 1–3 for 60, 80 and 90%
base glycerol solutions, respectively. It is observed that
adding particles has little effect on surface tension and
fluid density, but values of viscosity increase slightly as
particle concentration increases. Particle number density
ϕ was computed by the following equation:
ϕ ≡

= NP

Where D is the average diameter of particle, NP
is the number of particles added to solutions; W
represents the weight, ρ the density and V the volume.

of the 80% glycerol solution owing to the viscos-
ity effect. However, adding particles can effectively
expand the operating windows for both base solutions.
It should be noted that the maximum coating speeds
are almost the same for a fixed flow rate q as dis-
played in Figs 7–9, and only the operating windows
are expanded.
The increase in the maximum coating speed as
a function of particle number density is displayed
in Fig. 10. Here the dimensionless increase of the
maximum differential coating speed X is defined as
X ≡ Vae − Vae0
Vae0
(2)
Vae0 is the maximum coating speed for the base glyc-
erol solution and Vae is the maximum coating speed for
a solution with particles added. The results in Fig. 10
indicate that the maximum coating speed increases as
particle number density increases. The smaller the par-
ticle size, the higher the maximum coating speed. The
dimensionless minimum wet thickness t as a function
of Reynolds number, Re is plotted in Fig. 11; t and Re
are defined as

Here VS is the average speed in the slot and VW is
the web speed. Note that Re is defined as the ratio
of the inertial force to the viscous force. The inertial
force is defined as the force for the coating solution
emanating from the slot exit to impinge on the moving
web. The viscous force refers to the drag force to pull
the deposited solution on the moving web.

The model developed by Yamamura, et al . may not be
applicable to our results because the model was based
on the lubrication approximation in which the inertial
force was not included. The Reynolds number in our
study exceeds unity for many cases. Up to now, there
is no sound physical explanation for the particle effect.
More theoretical works are necessary.

ABSTRACT 
   The objective of the present study is to examine the validity of the 
theoretical predictions on the operating windows of slot die coating. The 
operating window is defined as a domain inside which stable and uniform 
coating is possible, different types of coating defects are found outside 
the window.  A flow visualization technique was applied to observe the 
coating bead, particularly the positions and shapes of the downstream and 
upstream menisci, just before and after coating defects appear at high 
coating speeds.  Special features of coating bead shapes which lead to 
onsets of ribbing and air entrainment were identified.  The 
two-dimensional flow in the coating bead region was computed by the 
commercial software package FLOW-3D®. Critical features observed 
experimentally for the onset of coating defects were used to judge if the 
coating flow was within the operating window.  The theoretically 
evaluated operating windows were found to be much larger than those 
determined experimentally in terms of coating speeds. However, the 
qualitative trends of theoretical predictions agree with experimental 
observations.

Hrymak9 used the commercial software package FIDAP to study the 
coating flow of a two-layer slot die system. Carvalho, et al.10,11,12 
developed a two-dimensional model to simulate the fluid motion in the 
coating bead region. Brethour13 tried to predict the operating windows of 
some viscoelastic solutions with the commercial software package 
FLOW-3D®.   
Lee, et al.14 carried out an experimental study on slot die coating; 
they followed the methodology of Gutoff and Kendrick15 to determine the 
minimum wet thickness. They confirmed the predictions of Ruschak6 and 
Higgins and Scriven8. i.e., the minimum wet thickness goes up as 
capillary number (Ca) increases at low Ca. They also found that there 
exists a critical capillary number, above which the minimum wet 
thickness is independent of Ca,.  Recently Chang, et al.16 demonstrated 
experimentally that the minimum wet thickness may go up, go down or 
independent of Reynolds numbers. However, the shapes of the limiting 
coating beads were not reported in these experiments. 
    In the present study, we shall report the observation of the coating 
beads, particularly the positions and curvatures of the upstream and

of fluid on the slot die and on the web. Values of static contact angle have 
to be evaluated from the experiment or from existing data. Group 2 
involves geometric parameters such as slot gap, coating gap, die lip shape 
and length. Group 3 consists of operating parameters such as flow rate 
and web speed.  The shapes of the upstream and downstream menisci, 
the internal velocity and pressure fields will be generated by FLOW-3D®. 
Details on the commercial package FLOW-3D® can be found elsewhere 
(http://www.flow3d.com). 
 
EXPERIMENT 
    Several dilute glycerin solutions were prepared as test fluids. With 
different weight concentrations, the fluids would present different 
viscosities. The physical properties of the fluids are listed in Table 1. The 
contact angles of the fluids were measured as well, and the angles would 
be needed in the numerical simulation. 
    The schematic diagram of the experimental coater and the geometry 
of the slot die are shown in Fig. 3a and 3b respectively. The coating 
solution was pumped from the reservoir (E) through a filter and then into 
the slot die (A). The slot die would deliver a thin and uniform liquid film

can be determined. This type of coating window is the same as that 
presented by Blake et al.21 for curtain coating. The minimum wet 
thickness h of a particular coating solution can be calculated by h ≣q/Vm, 
where Vm is the coating speed along the lower boundary of the coating 
window as shown in Fig. 4(a) for V between Vmin and Vmax. Hence, a 
different coating window can be constructed with h plotted against V as 
shown in Fig. 4(b). 
 A flow visualization technique was applied to observe the coating flow, 
particularly the positions of the upstream and downstream menisci of the 
coating bead. A microscope (Nikon 4500) with a magnifying power of 64 
was positioned very close between the slot die and moving roller as 
shown in Fig. 5;  the microscope was connected to a CCD camera and 
then to a LCD monitor. With proper lighting, the images of the coating 
bead can be clearly displayed on the monitor screen. The focused plane 
should be around 5cm deep into the coating solution to avoid edge effects. 
The coating beads, particularly the shapes and locations of the upstream 
and downstream menisci just before and after coating defects appeared, 
were observed and recorded by this flow visualization technique. To 
detect the fluid motion in the coating bead region just before and after

appears at high coating speeds. Dripping alone would appear at low 
coating speeds, but it will disappear once the coating speed is increased. 
The comparison of theoretical predictions and experimental findings on 
dripping is not included in the present study. 
Ribbing 
A series of photos to show the coating bead before and after ribbing 
are displayed in Fig. 7. The q-V coordinates of the experimental points 
and simulation data are shown as A, B and A', B' and C' in Fig. 7(a), 
respectively.  At Point A, a smooth and uniform coating surface is 
observed in Fig. 7(b). The side view of the coating bead shows an 
upstream meniscus concave towards upstream direction and both the 
back-lip contact line ⑧ and web-contact line ⑥ located under the back 
die-lip. As the coating speed was increased and passed the boundary of 
the operating window, ribbing appeared on the coated surface for Point B. 
The wavy surface and the side view of coating bead are shown in Fig. 
7(c). The image of the coating bead reveals that the upstream meniscus 
was moving closer to the slot exit.

smooth, the upper meniscus is convex towards the upstream direction and 
the dynamic contact angles measured from the photos are around 130˚. At 
experimental Point B, the photos in Fig. 8(c) show that air bubbles were 
entrained into the coating film, and the coating bead was not stable at this 
time. By taking continuous animation, the shape of the coating bead at the 
moment of air entrainment was recorded. It was found that the upper 
meniscus was still convex towards the upstream direction, but the 
dynamic contact angle jumped from 130˚ to around 160˚ as shown in Fig. 
8(c). However, since air entrainment is not a continuous defect, the 
coating bead was unstable and the dynamic contact angle was observed 
jumping back and forth from 130to 160. Four cases A', B', C' and D’ 
with coating speeds 0.5, 0.53, 0.55 and 0.57m/s were examined by 
theoretical computations with FLOW-3D®, the results are shown in Fig. 
8(d)-(g). At Point A', the dynamic contact angles estimated is around 134˚. 
Both the back-lip contact line ⑧ and the web contact line ⑥ are under 
the back-lip. However, increasing the coating speed from 0.5 m/s to 0.53 
m/s would cause the dynamic contact angle to jump from 134˚ to 161˚. 
The web contact line ⑥ has moved towards the slot exit.  This is 
assigned as the critical speed leading to the onset of air entrainment. The

minimum wet thickness at different flow rates of the coating solutions 
can be predicted.  
Previous theoretical studies (Ruschak6, Higgins and Scriven8) 
predicted that the minimum wet thickness increases as capillary number 
(Ca) goes up for Ca<<1, Lee et al.14 and Yang et al.22 found that the 
minimum wet thickness is independent of Ca for 0.1<Ca<1. Comparison 
of theoretical predictions with experimental data for high-viscosity 
solutions in terms of the dimensionless minimum wet thickness vs 
capillary number is displayed in Fig. 10. Theoretical predictions are 
consistent with previous findings, i.e., the minimum wet thickness 
increases first and then becomes independent of Ca as Ca goes up. 
However, stable experimental data could not be obtained for low capillary 
numbers in the present study and values of th  minimum wet thickness 
was found to be somewhat higher than those predicted theoretically for 
the two high-viscosity solutions, but the theoretical predictions still 
provide some useful information on the evaluation of the minimum wet 
thickness for cases with capillary numbers less than unity. 
For low-viscosity solutions, the effect of fluid inertia can not be 
overlooked. Comparison of the minimum wet thickness between the

coating accurately, with the two-dimensional numerical simulation based 
on the commercial package FLOW-3D®. 
 A flow visualization technique was first applied to observe the slot 
die coating flow on a lab coater. The shapes and positions of the upstream 
and downstream menisci were the key areas for observation. Three 
coating defects outside the stable operating windows of slot die coating 
were observed. Defects such as breaklines coupled with dripping appear 
at high coating speeds. Two major types of coating defects, i.e., ribbing 
and air entrainment, may appear over a large range of coating speeds. It 
was found that before the onset of ribbing, the upstream meniscus is 
moving very close to the slot exit and the static contact angle between the 
downstream meniscus and the slot die surface becomes quite small. On 
the other hand, the upstream dynamic contact angle jumps from 130˚ to 
160˚ before the onset of air entrainment. These observations would serve 
as the indicators to judge if the simulated 2-D coating flow is stable or 
not. 
The experimentally observed critical conditions for the onset of 
ribbing and air entrainment were compared with those based on the 2-D

One still has to be careful in evaluating the operating window solely 
based on 2-D theoretical predictions, even with some types of flow 
stability analysis involved. The actual operating window will be smaller 
owing to minor experimental noises and 3-D phenomena. Since the 
coating defects are 3-D in nature, an ideal theoretical prediction requires 
3-D flow simulation with a stability analysis. At present it is still a 
formidable task.

Abstract 
 The fluid mechanics of narrow stripe coating for low-viscosity 
Newtonian solutions were investigated. It was found that the coating 
solution will expand laterally after emanating from the slot die channel at 
low coating speeds. As coating speed increases, the stripe width will 
contract until it is close to the slot channel width, then coating failure 
would appear. Three slot channel widths were tested, coating failure such 
as ribbing appears at high speeds for two larger slot channel widths. 
However, for the smallest channel width, the critical speed for coating 
failure to appear is much higher and the coating failure is not ribbing but 
the narrow stripe breaks periodically. The effects of each parameter on the 
coating width variation were examined and a universal correlation which 
involves Reynolds and Bond number was established to predict the 
coating width. 
 A flow visualization technique was applied to observe the mechanism 
on how a narrow stripe breaks at high coating speeds. 2-D and 3-D 
numerical simulations on coating flows were examined for a better 
understanding on the stability of narrow stripe coating. 
Key words: narrow stripe coating, low-viscosity Newtonian fluids, 
Reynolds number, Bond number, flow visualization, 
numerical solution.

 Slot die coating technology was invented by Beguin[4], Ruschak first 
proposed the concept of operating window, which is a closed region for 
stable and uniform coating[5]. Later, Higgins and Scriven[6] included the 
viscous effect into Ruschak’s framework. Lee et al.[7] determined the 
minimum wet thickness of slot die coating experimentally; they found 
that there exists a critical capillary number, below which the minimum 
wet thickness goes up as capillary number increases, above which the 
minimum wet thickness is independent of the capillary number. Carvalho 
et al.[8] developed numerical schemes to evaluate slot die coating and 
also found the minimum wet thickness may go down as capillary number 
increases at high capillary numbers. More recently, Chang et al.[9] found 
through a flow visualization technique that depending on the Reynolds 
number, the minimum wet thickness may go up or go down. Chang et 
al.[10] also examined the mechanism for the start-up of slot die coating. 
Chang et al.[11] examined the difference between slot die coating at 
horizontally or vertically downward position. Later Chang et al.[12] 
included the effect of vacuum slot on slot die coating. 
 Several researchers examined fluid flow after a stripe was coated on 
a substrate; Dobroth and Erwin[13] studied the surface profile of a stripe. 
Huppert[14] considered the expansion of a viscous drop. Vafaei and 
Podowski[15] studied the effect of gravity and surface tension on the 
expansion of a coated drop[16]. There are also some patents that describe 
how to deliver multiple stripes with different approaches on die design[17, 
18].   
 In this paper, we shall present the study on the fluid mechanics of a 
5 
 
die and form a uniform liquid sheet when emanating from the die. To 
control the width of the narrow coated stripe, shims with different widths 
as shown in Fig. 2(b) were made. Three coating widths were tested, the 
widest one was 0.1m, which was used for comparison, another widths 
under investigation were 0.01 and 0.001m. 
 To observe the forming and the onset of defects for stripe coating, a 
flow visualization technique was employed. A video camera (CP-4500, 
Nikon) was set up to observe from top the forming and coating width of 
the stripe, the image could be magnified 24 times and the minimum scale 
for identification is 3.0×10-4m. Another microscope (SZ-6045, Olympus) 
with a magnifying power 64 was positioned to observe the coating bead 
from the side, the microscope was connected to a CCD camera (EX-F1, 
Casio), so the images could be recorded. The CCD camera is capable of 
taking 300 frames per second. To observe the coating bead clearly, proper 
lighting is critical to catch the sharp images of both the upstream and 
downstream menisci. The focusing plane has to penetrate into the coating 
bead to avoid side effect. Images can be modified by software such as 
Photoshop or AutoCad for better presentation. 
 A dilute poly(vinyl) alcohol (PVA) and glycerol solutions were used 
as test fluids. PVA which was made by Chang-Chun Petrochemical 
Co.(BP 24) has a weight molecular approximately 120,000, and the 
degree of hydrolysis is around 86-89%. Viscous glycerol solutions 
purchased from Uni-Ward Co. could be diluted for flow experiment. The 
concentration of PVA was prepared low enough that coating solution did 
not have any non-Newtonian flow behavior, because solutions for coating

 The effect of channel width W is discussed first. Three channel 
widths were examined and variations of ∆w, which is the difference 
between coating width and slot channel width are presented as a function 
of coating speed in Fig. 4. There is a slight mechanical instability of the 
lab coater if the coating speed is too low, so there are no data for 
V≦0.07m/s. It is noted that all the coatings will spread in the lateral 
direction at low coating speeds and for each case as the coating speed 
increases, the coating width will contract. When the coating width is 
close to or slightly smaller than the slot channel width, coating defects 
would appear. It is interesting to note that for the two cases with wider 
channel widths, ribbing would appear at Vmax1 as the coating defect. 
Ribbing usually appears as a coating defect for slot die coating of 
low-viscosity solutions in many studies[7, 9, 11], so the experimental 
results for these two channel widths are similar to those reported 
previously. The case with smallest channel width w=1.0×10-3m is 
somewhat different, coating defect would appear at a much higher speed 
Vmax2. In addition, the coating defect is no longer ribbing; the narrow 
coated stripe just breaks and then starts again, so there will be a series of 
long coated stripes appeared on the substrate. The mechanism of this 
repeated coat-and-break coating behavior will be discussed later. Since 
the behavior of the narrow channel w=1.0×10-3m is different from 
previous observations, and the maximum coating speed is significantly 
higher than wider stripes, the experimental results in the following figures 
are all based on this channel width. 
 The effects of flow rate on the coating width and the maximum 
A universal correlation was developed through a stepwise regression 
procedure to predict the variation of coating width with all the forces 
involved, the results are presented in Fig. 6; here the dimensionless 
coating width Φ is proportional to Re0.4Bo0.5, the Reynolds and Bond 
numbers are defined as: 
  
2uRe
V / H
ρ≡ μ               (1) 
  
ghBo
/ r
ρ≡ σ                 (2) 
and  Φ=41×Re0.4Bo0.5       (3)  
with R2=0.845 
 Equation (3) can serve as an indicator on how each parameter would 
influence the coating width, if Φ is around unity, the experimental results 
indicate that the coated stripe may break, so this correlation can also be 
used to predict the maximum coating speed. 
 The mechanism for the break-up of the narrow coated stripe can be 
demonstrated by a series of photos of the coating bead as shown in Fig. 7. 
For stable stripe coating, the coating bead is bound by the upstream and 
the downstream menisci and remains unchanged at steady coating speeds. 
However, as shown in Fig. 7, once the coating speed reaches a critical 
value, the coating bead is no longer stable. The upstream meniscus is 
moving toward the slot exit first as shown in Fig. 7(b), then the 
downstream meniscus will also move downward to the die lip as shown

of narrow stripe coating. 
Figure 9 presents the comparison of the simulation on 3D narrow 
stripe coating flow and the 2D simulation of coating bead. The basis of 
comparison for 2D and 3D simulations is that the flow rate per slot 
channel width qs is identical. Figure 9(a) indicates that for the 3D case,   
the coating solution will spread, then the flow rate per coating width qc is 
smaller than qs. For 2D simulation it is assumed qs=qc, therefore 
comparison of coating beads between Figs. 9(a-2) and (a-3) indicates that 
the coating bead (a-2) based on 3D simulation is smaller than that in Fig. 
9(a-3) based on 2D simulation. The upstream of the coating bead in Fig. 
9(a-3) is close to the rear end of the die lip corner, therefore it is likely 
dripping would appear. However, the coating bead in Fig. 9(a-2) is 
smaller and more stable. Therefore the spreading of the narrow coated 
stripe can stabilize the coating bead. The flow field in Fig. 9(b-1) and the 
coating bead shapes (b-2) and (b-3) based on 3D and 2D simulations 
indicate if the coating width is very close to the slot channel width, or 
qs=qc, as shown in Fig. 9(b-1), the shapes of coating beads based on 2D 
and 3D simulations are similar, therefore under the situation qs=qc, the 
results of 2D and 3D simulation on coating flow are similar. The results 
in Fig. 9(c-1) indicate the coating width is smaller than the slot channel 
width, then qc>qs for the case in Fig. 9(c-2), which is based on the 3-D 
simulation. But the 2D simulation in Fig. 9(c-3) is still based on qc=qs, 
therefore there is less flow in the coating bead region, the upstream 
meniscus is highly distorted and the coating bead is unstable. The 
comparison in Fig. 9 clearly indicates that owing to the ability to spread

And the other group which involves viscosity, surface tension and coating 
speed will cause the coating to contract. A universal correlation which 
involves the Reynolds and Bond numbers was established, which can be 
used to estimate the coating width and the maximum coating speed. 
 The mechanism for the break-up of narrow stripe was investigated 
both experimentally. A flow visualization technique was applied to 
observe the fluid motion in the coating bead region above the maximum 
coating speed for stable coating. It was found that both the upstream and 
downstream menisci of the coating bead will approach each other, then 
the coating bead is shrinking until it breaks. The coating solution 
emanating from the slot die exit will accumulate on the downstream die 
lip region afterwards until it is too heavy and falls on the moving 
substrate. Consequently, the narrow stripe will form and break 
periodically. 
 Simulation based on the software package FLOW-3D reveals that for 
narrow stripe coating, the coating width can be adjusted so that the 
coating bead can be more stable when compared with conventional 2-D 
slot die coating.

The system was solved by the commercial software package 
FLOW-3D® using the finite volume method. A typical grid is displayed 
in Fig. II. The flow domain is discretized into 21,600 square cells, and the 
length of each side of the cell is 10μm. The dimensions of the flow 
domain are also given in Fig. 11. The downstream length has to be long 
enough to ensure the rectilinear flow profile exists on the moving web. 
    The most critical part for solving the flow system is the
