Abstract 
 
In this study, a novel electrochemical method for treating wastewater containing 
benzene compound, aniline, has been investigated. In the electrolytic cell, the organic 
compound is ionized or is oxidized by direct electrolysis on the anode. Meanwhile, this 
method applied H2O2 and ferrous ion to produce hydroxyl radicals for oxidizing the 
contaminants, in which ferrous ion is regenerated via the reduction of ferric ion on the 
cathode. 
 
This is a two-year project. In the first year, attention were paid on the effect of oxidation 
intermediates on the inhibition of parent compound oxidation during the reaction based 
on the operation parameters, such as concentration of contaminants, pH, catalyst 
concentration, oxidant concentration, catalytic ability of ferrous and ferric ions and the 
effects of inorganic anions on the electro-Fenton process. The reaction kinetics of 
aniline by electro-Fenton processes has been proposed. 
 
This is the first time in Taiwan to collect the data concerning the oxidation of benzene 
compounds by electro-Fenton processes. The results of this study can help our 
government in managing these kinds of benzene compounds, and also can be the basis 
of making regulations to control their remaining in environment.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1 Rational 
Pollution of water and environment by toxic and nonbiodegradable organic material of 
industrial or agriculture origin brings about very serious health hazards for all living 
species of the nature.  The pollutants of different chemical composition excludes the 
possibility of using an universal treatment method and led to the development of special 
treatment methods. 
 
Recent progress in chemical water treatment has lead to the development of Advanced 
Oxidation Processes (AOPs).  Common oxidants involved in AOPs are Fenton’s 
reagent, Ozone, Ozone/H2O2, and UV/H2O2 of which the primary intermediate is the 
hydroxyl radical (•OH).  Fenton’s reagent, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and a 
ferrous, is an effective and simple oxidant of organic contaminants.  It has been proven 
to be effective in treating various organic contaminants such as nitrophenol, dye, 
aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic, ethers, and photographic wastewater (Korenaga, 
et al., 1998; Ewa et al., 1991).  The Fenton reagent as  an oxidant for wastewater 
treatment is attractive due to the facts that iron is a highly abundant and non toxic 
element and H2O2 is easy to handle and environmental benign making (Munter, 2001; 
Pignatello, 1992).  Moreover this process is easy to operate with low cost (Lu, 2003) 
However, the application of Fenton’s reagent in the destruction of organic has been 
limited by the slurry because ferric hydroxide sludge requires addition separation 
process and disposal.  There is a development of new advanced electrochemical 
oxidation process (AEOP) which the so-call Electro-Fenton for the detoxification of 
organic wastewater without the slurry disadvantage (Brillas et al., 2001).  This method 
is based on electrocatalytic generation of Fenton’s reagent to produce hydroxyl radical.  
 
Aniline was chosen as a target compound.  It is widely used as an intermediate in the 
synthesis of dyes.  It is also used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, photographic 
developers, shoe polish, etc.  Exposure to aniline is toxic because it produces 
methemoglobin.  In humans, blood methemoglobin levels are often measured as an 
index of exposure to aniline.  This research study intends to investigate the efficiency of 
aniline removal by Fenton, electro-Fenton, and combined Fenton&electro-Fenton 
processes at pH 2.0. 
 
1.2 Objectives 
The main objectives of this study are: 
 
1. To compare the aniline removal efficiency of Fenton, electro-Fenton, and combined 
Fenton&electro-Fenton processes. 
 
2. To determine the effects of H2O2 dosage, initial concentration of Fe2+, and initial 
concentration of aniline on the aniline removal efficiency of Fenton, electro-Fenton, 
and combined Fenton&electro-Fenton processes.

CHAPTER 2 THEORIES AND LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
 
2.1 Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) 
Advanced Oxidation Processes have been defined as those which involve the generation 
of hydroxyl radicals (•OH) in sufficient quantity to carry out the destruction of toxic 
pollutants (Glaze et al, 1987). The AOPs is the use of high energy oxidants that can 
generate •OH.   The •OH is a powerful, non-selective chemical oxidant, which acts very 
rapidly with most organic compounds.  The reaction rate constants of •OH are shown in 
Table 2.1.

are more environmentally friendly than typical chemical methods used in polluted water 
treatment. One of them, electro-Fenton process is based on the use of an undivided 
electrolytic cell containing an anode (Pt) and a cathode (Graphite) where H2O2 is 
electrogenerated via two-electron reduction of O2 at the cathode.  When Fe2+ is added to 
the solution, pollutants can be mainly destroyed by •OH produced via Fenton reaction. 
And Fe3+ can be continuously transformed to Fe2+ via one-electron reduction at the 
cathode. 
 
Electro-Fenton process can be generally divided into three groups. The first group (EF-
H2O2 method) uses Fe2+ and electrogenerate H2O2, that can be produced from the two-
electron reduction of sparged oxygen on graphite, reticulated vitreous carbon, or 
carbon-PTFE cathodes.  Its disadvantage is the low current efficiency in acidic 
condition (Sudoh, et al., 1986; Tzedakis, et al., 1989; Hsiao and Nobe, 1993; Brillas et 
al., 1996).  The second group (EF-Feox method) utilizes H2O2 and electrogenerated Fe2+ 
which is produced via the oxidation of iron, the sacrificial anode (Pratap and Lemley, 
1994; Huang, et al., 1997). The last group called Fenton sludge recycling (FSR) system, 
involves a Fenton reactor and electrolytic cell for reducing the ferric hydroxide sludge 
to ferrous ion (Gnann, 1993). 
 
In the equations below, the radical of •OH, •OH2 and •OH2- are consumed and 
regenerated in the reaction system, which is influenced by H2O2, Fe2+ and Fe3+ as shown 
in Figure 2.1 and equation (8) to (11).  When electricity is employed in the process, Fe3+ 
can be reduced to Fe2+ more efficiently and rapidly, and then increases the reaction rate.  
In addition, low pH and anaerobic condition are employed to prevent the oxidation of 
ferrous ion by many investigators. However, over-low pH will decrease reaction rate.  
Therefore, solution pH should be kept at optimum value.  Then, the high efficiency of 
hydrogen peroxide decompose to hydroxyl radical is maintained.

Iron salt acts as a catalyst for hydrogen peroxide decomposition, further reaction (4) and 
(5) regenerate Fe2+.  In addition to free radical scavengers, the process is inhibited by 
(iron) chelants such as phosphates, EDTA, formaldehyde, and citric/oxalic acids.  
Because of the sensitivity of Fenton’s Reagent to different wastewater, it is 
recommended that the reaction always be characterized through laboratory treatability 
tests before proceeding to plant scale.

Aniline is prepared commercially by the reduction of nitrobenzene, a product of coal 
tar, or by heating chlorobenzene with ammonia in the presence of a copper catalyst. 
Sulfonation of aniline yields sulfanilic acid, the parent compound of the sulfa drugs.  
Figure 2.2 Structure of aniline 
 
Aniline is also important in the manufacture of rubber-processing chemicals and 
antioxidants. Its physical and chemical properties are shown in Table 2. 
 
2.4.2 Toxicology of Aniline 
Aniline can be toxic with organism because aniline damages hemoglobin, a protein that 
normally transports oxygen in the blood.  The damaged hemoglobin can not carry 
oxygen.  This condition is known as methemoglobinemia and its severity depends on 
exposure level and time.  Methemoglobinemia is the most prominent symptom of acute 
aniline poisoning in humans, resulting in cyanosis (a purplish blue skin color).  
Dizziness, headaches, irregular heart beat, convulsions, coma, and death may also 
occur.  Direct contact with aniline can also produce skin and eye irritation.  Long-term 
exposure to lower levels of aniline may cause symptoms similar to those experienced in 
acute high-level exposure.  There is no reliable information on whether aniline has 
adverse reproductive effects in humans.  Studies in animals have not demonstrated 
reproductive toxicity for aniline.

• Corrosion control, destroys residual chlorine and reduced sulfur compounds 
thiosulfates, sulfites, and sulfides, which form corrosive acids when condensed onto 
processing equipment and oxidized by air. 
• BOD/COD removal, oxidizes both organic and inorganic pollutants which 
contribute to BOD and COD.  H2O2 can also affect BOD/COD removal by 
enhancing the performance of the other process that can see enhancement 
(combination) applications 
• Toxicity reduction / Biodegradability improvement, H2O2 can react with catalysis, 
chemically digests complex organics into smaller, less toxic and more biodegradable 
fragment. 
• Organic oxidation, H2O2 can hydrolyzes formaldehyde, carbon disulfide, 
carbohydrates, organophosphorus and nitrogen compounds and destroys virtually 
any other organic requiring treatment. 
 
2.5.2 Enhancement (Combination) Applications  
The more difficult-to-oxidize pollutants may require the H2O2 to be activated with 
catalysts such as iron, copper, manganese, or other transition metal compounds.  These 
catalysts may also be used to speed up H2O2 reactions that may otherwise take hours or 
days to complete.  
 
Advanced Oxidation Processes represent the newest development in H2O2 technology.  
Typically, this means combining H2O2 with ozone or ultraviolet light.  The result is the 
on-site total destruction of even refractory organics without the generation of sludges or 
residues.  This technology is being widely applied to treat contaminated groundwaters, 
to purify and disinfect drinking waters and process waters, and to destroy trace organics 
in industrial effluents.

Chemical reactions of the hydroxyl radical in water.  There are four typical types of 
reaction occurring when •OH presents in water. 
• Addition,  the hydroxyl radical adds to an unsaturated compound, aliphatic 
or aromatic, to form a free radical product such as cyclohexadienyl radical as 
shown below.

b. A constant ratio of Fe : substrate above the minimal threshold, typically 1 part Fe per 
10-50 parts substrate, which produces the desired end products.  (Note that the ratio 
of Fe : substrate may affect the distribution of reaction products). 
c. A supplemental aliquot of Fe which saturates the chelating properties in the 
wastewater, thereby availing unsequestered iron to catalyze the formation of 
hydroxyl radicals. 
 
Iron dose may also be expressed as a ratio to H2O2 dose.  Typical ranges are 1 part Fe 
per 5-25 parts H2O2 (wt/wt).  
 
2.6.3 Effect of Iron Type (Ferrous or Ferric)  
For most applications, it does not matter whether Fe2+ or Fe3+ salts are used to catalyze 
the reaction, the catalytic cycle begins quickly if H2O2 and organic material are in 
abundance.  However, if low doses of  Fenton’s Reagent are being used (e.g., < 10-25 
mg/L H2O2), Bishop, 1968 suggests ferrous iron may be preferred.  Neither does it 
matter whether a chloride or sulfate salt of the iron is used, although with the former, 
chlorine may be generated at high rates of application. It is also possible to recycle the 
iron following the reaction.  This can be done by raising the pH, separating the iron floc, 
and re-acidifying the iron sludge.  There have been some recent developments in 
supported catalysts that facilitate iron recovery and reuse.  
 
2.6.4 Effect of pH 
The drop in efficiency on the basic side is attributed to the transition of iron from a 
hydrated ferrous ion to a colloidal ferric.  In the latter form, iron catalytically 
decomposes the H2O2 into oxygen and water, without forming hydroxyl radicals.  There 
have been some recent developments using non radical scavenging sequestering agents 
(e.g., gallic acid) to extend the useful pH range to pH 8-9, but no commercial 
applications are known.  The drop in efficiency on the acid side is less dramatic given 
the logarithmic function of pH, and is generally a concern only with high application 
rates.  
 
The first inflection is caused by the addition of FeSO4 catalyst which typically contains 
residual H2SO4.  A second, more pronounced drop in pH occurs as the H2O2 is added, 
and continues gradually at a rate which is largely dependent on catalyst concentration.  
This drop in pH is attributed to the fragmenting of organic material into organic acids.  
This pH change is often monitored to ensure that the reaction is progressing as planned, 
the absence of such pH decrease may mean that the reaction is inhibited and that a 
potentially hazardous build-up of H2O2 is occurring within the reaction mixture.  In 
highly concentrated waste streams (>10 g/L COD), it may be necessary to perform the 
oxidation in steps, readjusting the pH upwards to pH 4-5 after each step or so to prevent 
low pH from inhibiting the reaction.  
 
2.6.5 Effect of Reaction Time  
The time needed to complete a Fenton reaction will depend on the many variables 
discussed above, most notably catalyst dose and wastewater strength. Determining the 
completion of the reaction may prove troublesome. The presence of residual H2O2 will 
interfere with many wastewater analyses.  Residual H2O2 may be removed by raising 
 13
reagent to produce hydroxyl radical.  The major intermediary degradation products were 
hydroquinone, benzoquinone, 4-nitrocatechol, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene and 3,4,5-
trihydroxynitrobenzene.  The rate constants of the hydroxylation reaction were also 
determined.  The mineralization of the initial pollutant and the intermediates formed 
during electro-Fenton treatment was studied using total organic carbon (TOC) analyses.  
Mineralization rate was higher at the beginning of the electrolysis, but diminished with 
the decrease in compound concentration in the reaction mixture and with changes in 
their structure, i.e., from aromatics to aliphatics which are more resistant to 
mineralization by ring disrupting reactions.  Under optimum condition, the 
mineralization process reached 95% efficiency. 
Lin, et al. (2000) treated old-aged landfill leachate by combined chemical and biological 
methods.  The electro-Fenton method assisted by chemical coagulation was employed 
and found to be highly efficient in removing a large amount of refractory organic and 
inorganic compounds in the leachate.  The electro-Fenton oxidation employed was able 
to greatly enhance the COD removal of the leachate effluent from chemical coagulation.  
At optimum pH 4, the oxidation process rendered the leachate effluent totally colorless 
(i.e. 100% color removal).  An optimum H2O2 dosage of 750 mg/L yield a very good 
COD, color, NH3-N and phosphorus removal in less than 30 minutes.  Final treatment of 
the leachate effluent by sequencing batch reactor (SBR), was able to achieve the quality 
up to the standard for direct discharge or for reuse as non-potable water. 
Brillas, et al. (2001) studied about aniline degradation by electro-Fenton and peroxi-
coagulation processes using a flow reactor for wastewater treatment.  The electro-
Fenton process with 1 mM Fe2+ and a Ti/Pt or DSA anode yields an insoluble violet 
polymer, while the soluble total organic carbon (TOC) is gradually remove, reaching 
61% degradation after 2 hours at 20 Ampere.  In this treatment, aniline was 
preferentially oxidized by hydroxyl radicals formed in solution from reaction of Fe2+ 
with H2O2.  The peroxi-coagulation process with an Fe anode has higher degradation 
power, allowing to remove more than 95% of pollutants at 20 ampere.  
Huang, et al. (2001) compare a novel electro-Fenton method with traditional Fenton 
process in treating a highly contaminated wastewater.  By combining electrochemical 
reduction and chemical oxidation, the process can successfully remove organic 
compounds and heavy metals in a batch reactor.  A PVC-stabilizer processing 
wastewater was treated in this investigation owing to its high heavy-metal concentration 
(Pb = 7,500 mg/l) and high organic concentration (COD = 11,000 mg/l).  The major 
organic component was acetate.  Direct anodic oxidation showed no effect on COD 
removal. Fenton's method only removed 36% of COD with 4,000 mg-Fe2+/l and 28,000 
mg-H2O2/l.  In the Fered-Fenton method, about 89% of COD was removed with 2,000 
mg-Fe3+/l and 28,000 mg-H2O2/l.  Furthermore, the COD removal attained an efficiency 
of about 98% for 56,000 mg-H2O2/l used.  Results demonstrate that the Fered-Fenton 
method is superior to direct anodic oxidation and Fenton's method in this case. 
Panizza, et al. (2001) investigated on the treatment of an industrial wastewater mainly 
containing naphthalene- and anthraquinone-sulphonic acids by electrogenerated 
Fenton’s reagent.  The hydrogen peroxide was produced in situ by electrochemical 
reduction of oxygen on graphite-felt cathode and the Fe2+ ion was also regenerated by 
cathodic reduction of Fe3+.  The influence of cathode potential, Fe2+ concentration and 
electrode surface pre-treatment on the treatment performance was investigated.  The 
 15
Fenton system was more efficient and enable more thorough atrazine degradation.  The 
results show that the Fenton’s reagent can be electrochemically produced in aqueous 
solution, thereby leading to an efficient and continuous •OH production, with limited 
competitive reaction.  This simple system produces ferrous iron in situ by the reduction 
of ferric iron, with the simultaneous reduction of oxygen into hydrogen peroxide. 
Widera, et al (2002) determined electrochemical oxidation of aniline in a silica sol-gel 
matrix.  An acid catalyzed process that used tetramethyl orthosilicate as the precursor 
and aniline as a  yielded the silica.  When the aging time limited to one day so that a 
mesoporous solid was obtained, the potentiodynamic oxidation of aniline at carbon fiber 
electrode results in the formation of polyaniline.  The results supported the hypothesis 
that the pore structure of sol-gel electrolytes can influence the pathways of electrode 
reactions. 
Boye, et al. (2003) compared anodic oxidation, electro-Fenton and photoelectron-
Fenton treatment of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid.  The methods are carried out in 
an undivided cell with a Pt anode and O2-diffusion cathode within the pH 2.0-4.0, 
operating at low current and with 1 mM Fe2+.  Photoelectro-Fenton treatment yields fast 
and complete depollution of solution with 2,4,5-T concentration up to about saturation.  
An electro-Fenton reaction leads to 60-65% of mineralization.  The anodic oxidation is 
very poorly mineralized the pollutant.  The herbicide decay always follows a pseudo-
first-order.  Serveral intermediates can detected including 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,5-
dichlorohydroquinone, 4,6-dichlororesorcinol, and carboxylic acid group. 
Brillas, et al. (2003) studied on the mineralization of acid aqueous solution with 
herbicide 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (dicamba) by electro-Fenton and 
photoelectro-Fenton using a Pt anode and an O2-diffusion cathode.  While electro-
Fenton yield 60-70% mineralization, photoelectro-Fenton allows a fast and complete 
depollution of herbicide solution.  In both treatment, the initial chlorine is rapidly 
released to the medium as chloride ion.  The dicamba decay follows a pseudo-first order 
reaction, as determined by reverse-phase chromatography.  Formic, maleric and oxalic 
acids have been detected in the electrolyzed solution by ion-exclusion chromatography.  
In electro-Fenton, all formic acid is tranformed into CO2, and maleric is completely 
converted into oxalic acid, remaining stable Fe3+-oxalato complexes in the solution. 
Brillas, et al. (2003) determined electrochemical degradation of chlorophenoxy and 
chlorobenzoic herbicide in acidic aqueous medium by the peroxi-coagulation method.  
This electrochemical method yields a very effective depollution of all compounds in 
acidic aqueous medium of pH 3.0.  Target compounds are oxidized substantially by 
hydroxyl radicals produced from Fenton’s reagent between Fe2+ and H2O2 generated by 
the corresponding Fe anode and O2-diffusion cathode.  Their products can then be 
removed by mineralization or coagulation with the Fe(OH)3 precipitate formed. Both 
degradation paths complete at low currents. The efficiency of this method decreases 
with increasing electrolysis time and current.  The decay of all herbicides follows a 
pseudo-first-order reaction.

CHAPTER 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
 
4.1 Control Experiments 
The results of control study are summarized in Figures 4.1 and 4.2.  It was found that 
aniline and TOC were not removed significantly during the experiments when the 
Fe2+or H2O2 or electricity current was applied individually as an oxidant.  Therefore, all 
the aniline degradation observed in next sections was solely due to hydroxyl radical 
oxidation.

The results from TOC analysis as shown in Figure 4.5 reveal that some organic products 
from aniline degradation can be further oxidized or mineralized to carbon dioxide; i.e., 
approximately 25 and 50% reduction for Fenton and electro-Fenton processes, 
respectively.   
 
However, it is important to note that the removal efficiency of aniline and TOC were 
quite difference.  In fact, in the case of electro-Fenton, the TOC reduction still occurred 
after aniline disappearance.  This indicates that the certain products from aniline 
destruction were less vulnerable to hydroxyl radical than aniline; therefore were 
attacked after the completed depletion of aniline.  Nonetheless, since the TOC reduction 
occurred simultaneously with the aniline degradation, it implies that some other 
intermediates were as susceptible to hydroxyl radical as the aniline.  As a result, they 
competed with each other for hydroxyl radical.

required addition Fe2+.  Increasing either Ti/Pt or DSA anode surface area or current 
intensity could sufficiently rectify ferrous regeneration further.  It can be concluded that 
electro-Fenton process at its optimum conditions should be able to completely removal 
aniline at a much lower Fe2+ concentration than typical Fenton process.

From kinetics point of view, it is interesting that, despite the overall removal efficiency 
was improved, an increase in ferrous from 0.0056 to 0.017 and 0.028 M in Fenton 
experiment reduced the initial oxidation rate of aniline from 2.0×10-4 to 7.12×10-5 and 
5.65×10-5 M/min, respectively.  This observation is understandable since Fe2+ can react 
with H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals as well as scavenge the hydroxyl radicals being 
generated (Pignatello, 1992) as shown in the following equations: 
 
 Fe2+ + H2O2  → Fe3+ + OHz + HO-   (16)
  Fe2+ + OHz  → HO- + Fe3+       (17) 
 
In other word, the competition of Fe2+ and organic compounds for the hydroxyl radicals 
became significant as the Fe2+ concentration increased.  After excess Fe2+ had been 
oxidized to Fe3+ at the expense of H2O2, the radicals can react with aniline exclusively.  
On the other hand, the effect of Fe2+ on the initial rate in electro-Fenton experiment was 
opposite to what happened in Fenton experiment, i.e., the rate increased from 2.83×10-4 
to 3.01×10-4 and 3.54×10-4 M/min in the presence of 0.0056, 0.017 and 0.028 M of Fe2+, 
respectively.  This implies that the supplied electrons with extra Fe2+ can somehow 
increase the overall efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation.  Further analysis in 
Figure 4.13 indicated that obtained initial rates from Fenton and electro-Fenton 
experiments under the conditions used in this study were linear-dependent with 
reciprocal ferrous concentration and ferrous concentration, respectively.  Therefore, the 
redox kinetics can be described by the following equations

A similar trend was also observed for electro-Fenton experiments as shown in Figure 
4.15.  However, in the experiment with 0.2 M of H2O2, the degradation of aniline was 
not completed; i.e., approximately 20% of initial aniline still remained in the solution 
after 120 minutes due to H2O2 limitation.  Nonetheless in the other scenarios, aniline 
was totally removed within one hour.   
In conclusion, in the electro-Fenton process without oxygen supply at the cathodes, the 
amount of H2O2 initially exists in the solution is one of the most important factor which 
controlling the degradation efficiency. 
Further analysis on the effect of H2O2 on the initial rate of aniline oxidation reveals a 
linear relationship for both scenarios as shown in Figure 4.16.  The initial rates 
increased from 5.2×10-5 to 7.12×10-5 and 3.28×10-4 M/min for Fenton experiment and 
from 2.87×10-4 to 3.01×10-4 and 2.56×10-4 M/min as the H2O2 increased from 0.2 to 0.3

Further investigations need to be done in order to explain this observation.  In addition, 
it was found that the Fenton&electro-Fenton process could reduce the COD very 
efficiently as shown in Figure 4.26 of which up to 60 minutes of power supply can be 
saved as compared to typical electro-Fenton process.

A.6  Procedure  
 
1. Weigh to the nearest 0.1 mg an amount of H2O2 equivalent to a titer of 30 ml (0.06 
grms of H2O2) using a 5 ml beaker and medicine dropper. Transfer sample to 
Erlenmeyer flask.  
2. Add to Erlenmeyer flask 50 ml of demineralized water, 10 ml of sulfuric acid 
solution, 10-15 ml of potassium iodide solution, and two drops ammonium 
molybdate solution.  
3. Titrate with 0.1 N sodium thiosulfate to faint yellow or straw color. Swirl or stir 
gently during titration to minimize iodine loss.  
4. Add about 2 ml starch indicator, and continue titration until the blue color just 
disappears.  
5. Repeat steps 2-4 on a blank sample of water (omitting the H2O2).  
 
 
A.7  Calculation  
 
Weight % H2O2 = (A - B) x (Normality of Na2S2O3) x 1.7  
 
Sample weight in grams  
 
 
where: A = ml Na2S2O3 for sample; B = ml Na2S2O3  for blank

Abstract 
The chemical wastewater for this study came from the petrochemical plant, which mainly produced aromatic 
compounds, organic acid, epoxidized soybeam oil (ESBO), poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), hexamethylene 
tetramine (HEXA), etc., in Taiwan. The discharging quantity from the plant was about 3000 CMD. The 
electro-Fenton method was applied for treating the bioeffluent of petrochemical manufacturing wastewater. 
The major pollutant in the bioeffluent was identified as hexamine, which is nonbiodegradable and 
contributed 20% of COD to the wastewater. The goal of this study was to treat the biotreatment effluent with 
more than 50% of COD removal efficiency to meet the Effluent standard of 2003 in Taiwan. 
Electro-Fenton and traditional Fenton were employed to treat this effluent for comparison. The onsite pilot 
reactor was operated at continuous mode for 800 hours. Results show that wastewater treated by traditional 
Fenton process could not meet the effluent standard in the range of operating conditions. However, more 
than 80% of COD was removed with the electro-Fenton process and the effluent quality can meet the 
standard; the consumed energy was 65 kWH/m3.

Introduction 
Innovative technologies of wastewater treatment, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), are developed to 
treat specific toxic and non-biodegradable organics. It is demonstrated that AOPs have been proven as an 
effective technology for treating hazardous organics in aqueous solution. Pignatello et al., (2006) have 
already reviewed numerous AOPs investigation, including homogeneous Fenton and electro-Fenton 
reactions with various organic compounds. There is no study focusing on the treatment of petrochemical 
wastewater by Fenton or electro-Fenton processes. 
 
Petrochemical wastewater often contains a high concentration of biodegradable compounds that possess 
either toxicity or activity inhibition to the biological unit. Numerous streams of wastewaters contain 
significant amounts of toxic organic compounds. While the wastewater contains toxic, inhibitory or 
refractory to biological cultures, chemical oxidation can pretreat the wastewater to produce biogenic 
intermediates. Conversely, biological pretreatment can initially remove the biodegradable fraction of 
cathode were stainless steel. The initial COD concentrations of bench-scale trials were all controlled at 200 
~ 255 mg/L. The electro-Fenton method was performed by continuously feeding the wastewater, which was 
controlled at pH = 3.5 in the pH adjustment tank. H2O2 was continuously added to the electrolytic reactor for 
treating the wastewater at constant current mode.

The wastewater for this study came from the petrochemical plant in Taiwan, which mainly produced 
wastewater containing organic acid, epoxidized soybeam oil (ESBO), poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), 
hexamethylene tetramine (HEXA), etc. The discharge quantity of treated wastewater from the plant was 
about 3000 CMD. Table 1 lists the composition of petrochemical wastewater. The characteristics of raw 
wastewater generally contained 3000 mg/L COD. The effluent qualities of the biotreatment process are 
shown in Table 2. 
 
Treatment by traditional Fenton process 
As mentioned above, COD concentration in the aerobic biotrement process was about 220–400 mg/L. It 
should contain a large amount of recalcitrant organics in wastewater, and the effluent did not meet the 
effluent standard. Thus, the Fenton process was applied for promoting the COD removal ratio. 
 
Fenton process was employed to treat bioeffluent by jar tests only. The reaction time was set at 30 minutes 
and the reaction pH was 3.5. Fig. 2 shows the effect of H2O2 dosage ranging from 0 to 600 mg/L COD 
removal. It was found that the maximum COD removal efficiency was 40 %, 600 mg/L of H2O2 and 1200 
Feasibility and treatability studies using this electro-Fenton method to treat bioeffluent were performed in 
batch-scale and pilot-scale processes, respectively. Table 3 lists the experimental conditions of the 
batch-scale electro-Fenton process. This finding suggests that more than 80 % of COD was removed, where 
the theoretical H2O2 dosage (i.e. 600 mg/L) was used, as shown in Fig. 4. The above screening tests indicate 
that only the electro-Fenton process can meet the treatment goal. Fig. 5 indicates the changes of influent and 
effluent COD concentrations and COD removal efficiency of this process during the operation. The influent 
COD concentrations ranged from 307 mg/L to 420 mg/L. The applied average H2O2 dosage, current and 
average total voltage were 940 mg/L, 4.4 amperes and 9 volts, respectively. The final pH values of the 
effluent ranged from 6.0 to 7.0 after neutralization, while the pH of the electrochemic cell ranged from 2.1 to 
3.2. The final effluent COD concentrations ranged from 86 mg/L to 214 mg/L with an average COD removal 
efficiency of 58 %.

Conclusions 
The electrode can keep stable at continuous operation for 792 hours. Traditional Fenton process could not 
treat this biotreatment effluent of petrochemical wastewater with more than 50% of COD removal efficiency. 
Only the novel electro-Fenton method is effective in treating this wastewater. It is revealed that the 
electro-Fenton process could polish the effluent of the current biotreatment to meet the effluent standard in 
Taiwan.

Abstract 
The use of goethite and hydrogen peroxide was recently found that they 
could effectively oxidize organic compounds. This research was to 
investigate the effect of adsorption, pH, Fe2+ and Fe3+ on the 2-CP oxidation. 
Results indicated that 2-CP can be decomposed with hydrogen peroxide 
catalyzed by goethite and the oxidation rate increased with decreasing 
goethite particle size. The optimum oxidation rate was observed at the pH 
below 3.0. Addition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ can enhance the catalytic oxidation rate 
of 2-CP very efficiently. The main mechanism of goethite catalyzing 
hydrogen peroxide to oxidize 2-CP may be due to the catalysis of ferrous 
ions and goethite surface. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Fenton process, a widely used and studied catalytic treatment system, has been 
applied to treat various wastes such as those found in the textile and chemical 
industries. It was first used to reduce odor in wastewater treatment plants, and from 
then on, hydrogen peroxide entered the realm of wastewater treatment. The Fenton 
system uses ferrous ions to react with hydrogen peroxide, subsequently producing 
hydroxyl radicals with a powerful oxidizing ability to degrade various toxic 
contaminants (Lipczynskakochany, Sprah et al. 1995; Spacek, Bauer et al. 1995; 
Miller, Valentine et al. 1996). Recent observations that various organic contaminants 
in water or soil can be oxidized by H2O2 in the presence of iron oxide minerals (Tyre, 
Watts et al. 1991; Watts, Udell et al. 1993; Ravikumar and Gurol 1994; Gates and 
Siegrist 1995; Lin and Gurol 1995) provided the motivation for this work. 
Furthermore, H2O2 and iron oxides are common constituents of natural and 
atmospheric waters (Moffett and Zika 1987; Cunningham, Goldberg et al. 1988).

thermal oscillator tank was used to maintain completely mixed at 30°C with a 
constant speed. The oxidation reaction was initiated after adding hydrogen peroxide. 
Samples were regularly taken to be filtered through Whitman filter papers upon 
withdrawal to separate goethite from the solutions, and the residual quantities of 2-CP 
were measured by an HPLC (Waters LC module 1). The total dissolved Fe was 
measured by an AA (Hitachi, z-8100) and ferric and ferrous ions was measured by 
colorimetric procedure. Hydrogen peroxide was analyzed by was analyzed by an 
iodometric titration with Na2S2O3 solution (17). A DO meter (MTW Microprocessor 
Oximeter OXI 196) was used to monitor the concentration of dissolved oxygen. 
 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The effect of goethite adsorption 
In our previous studies, 2-CP can be decomposed 
with hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by goethite 
before 500 min and oxidation rate increased with 
decreasing goethite particle size. Based on the results, 
it is three-stage reaction; the initial decomposition 
rate 2-CP was slow, and then it slightly increased 
after 90min. After the transition step, a rapid 
oxidation rate of 2-CP was observed. The amount 
of 2-CP adsorbed onto goethite surface was less than 10% under various particle size 
of goethite at initial pH 3.0 as shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the removal of 2-CP 
from solution is not due to the adsorption. 
The effect of pH 
The effect of pH on catalytic action of goethite in 
the oxidation of 2-CP with hydrogen peroxide was 
examined in a set experiment, the pH slight 
increased with time of reaction. Only the effect of 
initial pH on 2-CP decomposition will be discussed 
here. Typical changes in 2-CP concentration over 
time are shown in Fig. 2 for the range of pH, i.e. 2.0 
to 5.0. The optimum oxidation rate was observed at 
the pH below 3.0. According to the findings of Sedlak 
and Andren (Sedlak and Andren 1991), the most ideal pH for chlorodiphenyl and 
chlorobenzene is between 2 and 3. Sudouh found the optimum pH of phonel 
decomposition using Fenton’s reagent is between 2 and 3. At high pH, the degration 
of 2-CP decreased because ferric ions will form Fe(OH)3. It has low activity and will 
not react with hydrogen peroxide (Pignatello 1992). When the pH is too low, the

The reaction mechanism   
The mechanism of goethite catalyzing hydrogen peroxide 
to oxidize 2-CP are: (1) the surface of goethite 
catalyzing hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl 
radicals; (2) the ferrous ions generated from goethite 
combined with hydrogen peroxide and (3) the ferric 
ions generated from goethite combined with hydrogen 
peroxide. Therefore, it was compared the goethite/H2O2 
process with other systems such as Fe2+/H2O2, Fe3+/ 
H2O2, goethite/Fe3+/H2O2 and goethite/Fe2+/H2O2 
processes. As shown in Fig. 4, the rate of 2-CP 
degradation using Fe3+ is almost zero, and goethite 
as the catalyst is lower than that using Fe2+. Based on the results, the dissolution 
should be the main mechanism of goethite catalyzing H2O2 to oxidize 2-CP in this 
study. The proton-promoted dissolution is the initial rate-determining step. After a 
transition stage, the reductive dissolution of ferrous ions initiates Fenton’s reaction, 
thereby becoming the overall oxidation rate-determining step for the oxidation of 
2-CP. 
Conclusion 
Particle size of goethite and the pH of solution are important factors affecting the 
oxidation rate of 2-CP, because both of them can influence the concentration of 
ferrous ions due to goethite dissolution. Smaller size of goethite and acid condition 
will enhance the degradation of 2-CP with hydrogen peroxide. The main mechanism 
of goethite catalyzing hydrogen peroxide to oxidize 2-CP may be considered to be the 
mixture of ferrous salts and hydrogen peroxide, known as Fenton’s reagent, producing 
hydroxyl radicals with powerful oxidizing abilities to degrade 2-CP.

wastewater containing a mixture of refractory and biogenic compounds, and thereby conserve subsequent 
use of expensive chemical oxidant for the small remaining recalcitrant fraction. Consequently, there were 
used potential advantages of Fenton and electro-Fenton processes treating of petrochemical wastewater. 
 
The Fenton process, one of the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), is widely used as a suitable treatment 
method for highly concentrated wastewater due to its effectiveness in producing hydroxyl radical (Barbeni et 
al., 1987; Kang et al., 2002; Rivas et al., 2001). It combines hydrogen peroxide and ferrous salt to produce 
hydroxyl radical with powerful oxidizing abilities to degradation certain toxic contaminants (Kitis et al., 
1999; Lu et al., 2001; Yoon et al., 2001). One of the drawbacks for Fenton method is the production of a 
significant amount of ferric hydroxide sludge that needs further separation and disposal.  
 
Therefore, this paper presents a pilot scale electro-Fenton process, which is utilizing H2O2 and 
electrogenerated ferrous ion (Pratap and Lemley, 1994; Huang et al., 1997). The bench and pilot scale 
Fenton processes were carried out for comparing the feasibility of traditional Fenton and electro-Fenton 
processes. 
 
Materials and Methods 
 
Site description 
 
Figure 1. The flowchart of the biotreatment process in the petrochemical plant 
 
Fig. 1 shows the unit of biotreatment process in this plant and sampling points. The raw wastewater was 
treated by two upflow anaerobic sludge beds (UASB), and then discharged in one adjustment tank for low 
strength wastewater. Subsequently, the mixing wastewater was treated through an aerobic fluidized bed 
reactor and an activated sludge reactor. The sampling points were located at the discharge of final clarifier 
for the aerobic biotreatment process. The average COD concentration of the bioeffluent was 250 ~ 400 
mg/L. 
 
Electro-Fenton and traditional Fenton methods 
A batch-scale Fenton process and a pilot-scale electro-Fenton process were operated at room temperature. 
The dimensions of electrolytic reactor was 10 cm (L)ｘ10 cm (W)ｘ10 cm (H). Both the anode and the 
mg/L of Fe(Ⅱ). Fig. 3 shows the effect of reaction time on the COD removal efficiency. Apparently, 
increasing the reaction time at optimum dosage still cannot meet the effluent standard. This result indicates 
that only applying Fenton process is not enough to comply with the regulation.

Besides, contaminants may be oxidized into biologically degradable matter by just 
adding hydrogen peroxide, and oxygen produced from hydrogen peroxide enhances 
the decomposition abilities of microorganisms. It can also be used on soil remediation, 
because ferrous ions are often present in groundwater (Tyre, Watts et al. 1991; Kong, 
Watts et al. 1998). This study has focused on goethite (α-FeOOH) since it was found 
to be most reactive with H2O2 among the crystalline iron oxides tested (Gurol, Lin et 
al. 1997). Goethite, which has a very low solubility in water, is also the most abundant 
crystalline iron oxide mineral in nature (Bolt and van Riemdijk 1987; Stumm and 
Morgan 1996). Recently, the use of goethite and hydrogen peroxide was found that 
they could effectively oxidize organic compounds due to the catalysis of goethite 
surface and ferrous ion generation. Gurol and Ravikumar (1994) pointed out that 
hydrogen peroxide can oxidize pentachlorophenol and trichloroethylene adsorbed on 
sand particles by interacting with the natural iron content of sand particles. Lin and 
Gurol (1997) also found that n-butyl chloride was oxidized by hydroxyl radicals 
generated from the interaction of hydrogen peroxide with goethite particles. In 
previous studies, ferrous ions and hydrogen peroxide have been used to oxidize 
dichlorvos with an attempt to explore the behavior of dichlorvos oxidation and how 
factors such as pH, [H2O2] and [Fe2+] may influence the dichlorvos decomposition 
(Lu, Chen et al. 1997). 
This study was to investigate the oxidation of 2-Chlorophenols (2-CP) with hydrogen 
peroxide in the presence of goethite. 2-CP was selected as the model compound to 
explore the effect of goethite particle size and pH on the oxidation efficiency. Fe2+ 
and Fe3+ were also added to study their effect on the 2-CP oxidation to provide 
insight into the mechanism of catalytic decomposition of H2O2 on goethite in 
aqueous medium. 
 
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS 
Goethite used in this study was purchased from Aldrich. Goethite particles have a 
diameter between 0.21 and 0.044 mm. The density of granular goethite were ranged 
from 3.99 to 4.58 g/cm3. The concentration of the replaceable surface hydroxyl 
groups of the goethite was determined to be 5×10-4 mol/g. All other chemicals were of 
reagent grade. Solutions containing goethite and 2-CP were prepared and then were 
poured into 250 ml flasks after the pH adjustment. In homogeneous solutions of 
hydrogen peroxide and iron salts, the pH was observed to have a significant effect on 
the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation efficiencies of organic 
chemicals. In this study, we therefore selected initial pH of 3 as the reaction condition 
using solution of HClO4 but did not control a constant pH during the period of 
oxidation reaction. The pH variation during the reaction was < ±0.1 pH unit. A

hydrogen ion will cause the formation of FeOOH2+ to slow down the reaction, which 
consecutively causes the production rates of ferrous 
ions and hydroxyl radicals to decrease as well. 
The dissolution behavior of goethite 
The dissolution of goethite under acidic conditions 
requires protons which may bind to the surface and 
weaken critical bonds, resulting in the detachment 
of the metal species into solution (Stumm 1992). In 
addition, the dissolution rate increases with 
decrease of pH and increase of goethite dosage. 
The phenomenon is known as the 
proton-promoted dissolution reaction as 
described below:

Hydrogen peroxide was used as the oxidant in the system. Although there were 
ferrous ions generated in solution, the total amount of soluble iron did not 
significantly change with the various H2O2 concentration added in the solution 
without 2-CP (data not shown). Lin and Guro (1998) demonstrated that a lo 
concentration of H2O2 does not affect the surface reactivity and the structure of the 
goethite particle. Ferric ions detached from the surface in acidic solution Eq. (1), and 
subsequently followed by a homogeneous redox reaction Eq.(2).

To investigate the effect of goethite dissolution on the oxidation rate of 2-CP, ferrous 
iron were monitored at initial pH 3.0. as shown in Fig. 3. Based on the results, iron 
ions in the solution were mostly ferrous ions (>90%) during the experiment. Within 
the 90 min, the ferrous ions were negligible, and then the amount of dissolved ferrous 
ions slightly increased in the following transition region. The appearance of ferrous 
ions could be attributed to (1) the interaction between ferric ions and H2O2 (Eq.(2)), (2) 
Organic reductant (2-CP) can react with ferric ion to form a complex and then 
produce ferrous ions due to electron transformation (Eq.(4))(Dong 1993), and (3) the 
reductant bind to the surface of goethite to release ferrous ions (Eq. (5-7)(Zinder, 
Furrer et al. 1986).
