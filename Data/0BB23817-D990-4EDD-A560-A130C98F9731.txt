syngas (CO and H2) as a reducing agent to recovery and reduce the spent nickel oxide 
(NiO2-/SiO2) and cobalt-molybdenum oxide (Co3O4-MoO2-/Al2O3) catalysts to 
metallic nickel and cobalt-molybdenum [35,36]. Herein, we reported the utilization of 
plasma and gasification technique to recovery the spent platinum catalyst.  
2.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
2.1.  Thermogravimetric analysis  
The untreated spent catalyst (975 mg) was dried at 150 °C for 24 h. The weight 
loss of the spent catalyst was 12.3 mg and water content was calculated to be ~1.3%. 
The spent catalyst samples before/after drying were then individually identified by 
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA results (Fig. 1 and 2) indicated the onset 
of weight loss at 30 °C and an acceleration of weight loss at 1000 °C. No significant 
change of weight was observed at the temperature >1250 °C. From TGA results, the 
reasonable content of water and organic materials including tar and water in the 
untreated spent catalyst was considered as ~1.5% and 8.7% (Fig. 1), respectively.  
When untreated sample (10.7 g) was sintered in high temperature oven at >1200 
°C under atmospheric pressure for 2–3 h, the weight loss was 916 mg (8.6%). For the 
study of spent alumina-supported platinum (Pt/Al2O3) upon sintered by plasma, model 
sample (10.2 g) was put in the graphite crucible and sintered in N2 atmosphere under 
plasma condition at >1500 K for 2–3 h. The weight of the residue was found to be 9.3 
g and the weight loss was 8.8%. The weight loss of the untreated sample in high 
temperature oven at atmospheric pressure and sintered in N2 atmosphere under plasma 
condition is consistent with the result of TGA (8.7%).

39.98°, 46.67°, 68.15°, 81.56° and 86.30° (2θ, Fig. 4) and the index to {111}, {200}, 
{220}, {311}, and {222} planes [37] of the Pt face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal 
structure which was consistence with the reported data (see Table 2) [37– 39].

analyses were summered in Table 4 and Figure 10–12. In the samples after sintering 
either with or without plasma, most organic tar was vanished. For the samples treated 
under plasma conditions, its platinum content significantly increased from 0.89% to 
3.08% (wt %). However, the platinum content of the sintered samples in the high 
temperature oven only increased from 0.89% to 2.57% (wt %). As a result, the spent 
platinum catalyst under plasma treatment can be significantly purified and removed 
the organic tar to reform the metallic platinum.
