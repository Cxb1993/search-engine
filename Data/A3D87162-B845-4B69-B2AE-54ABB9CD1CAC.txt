Use a hashed master patient index for EMR and PHR 
sharing 
    
Abstract  
In this paper, we focus on master patient ID for querying patients’ clinical document 
in registry. As we know, IHE has a Patient Identifier Cross Referencing (PIX) 
Integration Profile supports the cross-referencing of patient identifiers from multiple 
hospitals. However, all the citizens have a personal ID number. And healthcare 
systems in hospitals usually would record both hospital assigned patient ID and the 
personal ID number in patient data. Using the personal ID number as a master 
patient ID would be a much easier way than IHE PIX for querying patient’s clinical 
documents.  However, the personal ID number used in PHR systems, which usually 
located in internet, will addressed lots of worry of personal privacy. In this paper we 
propose a compromise method for encrypting the personal ID number for not 
directly exposing personal ID number on internet. Using our suggestion methods, 
personal ID number cannot be deciphered by the technical persons, may be systems 
manager or hacker that can access the healthcare data. However, physicians and 
patients can still using personal ID number as a master patient index for accessing 
clinical documents in our system framework. 
 
Introduction  
 
Since 2010, the government of Department of Health(DOH) in Taiwan executes a 
project [1] to construct systems for sharing Electronic Medical Record(EMR) across 
hospitals. Standard HL7 CDA documents, such as radiology reports, laboratory 
reports, , medical summary etc. have be defined and announced[2] in the project. 
The project utilizes Virtual Private Network(VPN) and a EMR index center, similar to 
IHE XDS[3], for query patients’ medical records. Basing on the query result, we can 
retrieve EMRs for a specific patient from EMR storage gateway which located in 
separate hospitals. Currently, most of healthcare centers, over 100 hospitals, have 
joined the project for exchanging records. Although this is a huge and ambitious 
project, it lacks of carefully planning and testing. We have found some shortages and 
limitations of the project. For example, using VPN and proprietary EMR sharing 
functionalities will be very difficult for expanding the usages, such as difficult to 
integrate with personal health or home care systems.  
In Taiwan, the personal ID number was assigned since the baby was born. And each 
teenager can acquire a personal ID card from his locate government. The personal ID 
number has wide variety usages for unique identify the users in lots of applications. 
And the ID number not only be presented in personal ID card, but also been shown 
on driver license and Health insurance card (Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1. Example of health insurance card .  
 
 
All the citizens in Taiwan should join national health insurance and have their own 
health insurance card. As demo in figure 1, the personal ID number, N122*****6, is 
presented on the insurance card and embedded an IC chip in the card also. The IC 
chip contains personal medical data, such personal ID, patient exam dates and 
hospitals etc.  And hospitals usually set up card readers in clinical offices for patient 
medical data to hospital information systems.  
 
 Current document sharing specifications in Taiwan  
The health insurance card can be used as an authorization means for accessing 
patients’ clinical documents across hospitals. Using the IC card with patient consent, 
physicians can use patients’ personal ID as an index to query the web site of EMR 
exchange center. And access clinical documents and medical images of the patient 
through the gateways constructs in hospitals. Personal ID number plays the role as 
master index in the EMR exchanging infrastructure. Following shows a screenshot of 
exchange center, hospital information systems should upload a metadata data 
corresponding to each document that the systems generated to the data. And the 
data center can build the references for query clinical documents. Table 1 is part of 
the metadata specification announce by the data center.

Table 1. Clinical document metadata upload to EMR exchange center (brief for 
presentation) 
 
Basing on the metadata and personal ID number, we can query all the patients’ 
clinical documents and use the query results to access clinical documents that may 
be stored in separated gateway in different hospitals.  The DOH EMR exchange 
framework fulfill one single usage for sharing clinical documents across hospitals and 
only for the situation when patients have attending the hospitals with their health 
insurance card as a authorization certification. And the clinical documents and 
metadata are transmitted within a VPN that link the data exchange center and all the 
hospitals that join the project. VPN would be a simple secure way for exchange 
clinical data within a specific group of hospitals and members. However, the 
framework would limit the expansion for sharing clinical data in internet, such as PHR 
or homecare applications which would be inconvenience and almost impossible 
using VPH to exchange data with healthcare providers.  
      
Suggestion of encrypted of personal ID number used in PHR 
 
For expanding the clinical data sharing applications into internet, there should have 
even more sophisticate secure specifications for meeting different usages and 
document sharing conditions. We will not discuss all of the security issues in this 
paper. We would only focus on the considerations of using personal ID number as a 
rsonal ID number presented in CDA documents.  
 
Figure 3. ID encrypted CDA document for storing in PHR system  
 
AS demo in figure 3, we used SHA1 to hash both personal ID number and patient ID 
in the CDA document and used base64 encoding method to transfer hashed binary 
data into presentable strings. Because, the document is designed for using in internet 
PHR system, even the patient name in the document may also be replaced by nick 
name, as that shown in figure 3, for protecting personal privacy. After the document 
has been stored in a PHR system, the PHR system may also send a metadata to 
document index center. We suggest that use IHE XDS specifications for creating the 
metadata and integrating with standard XDS registry and repository. However, the 
personal identities in the metadata must also be protected for exchanging in internet. 
Follows 4 is a demonstration that presents the protected identifies in a XDS 
metadata.

Above is an example of the slot of sourcePatientInfo in a XDS metadata generated in 
a PHR system. This paper suggests that, for privacy reason, only a few of patient 
specific roles (as the mapping graphic on the right part of figure 4). In this project we 
plans to expand the functionalities of this portal to control the accessing of clinical 
documents that stored in distributed repositories. The SSO portal would be 
integrated with IHE XDS registry for the access control of clinical documents..
