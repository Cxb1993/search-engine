Abstract - The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  determine  
whether designers use holistic or piecemeal processing in 
mental rotation. The independent variables manipulated by 
this study were group type (designer group and regular 
group), the complexity of polygons, and different rotational 
angles. The dependent variable was the length of time 
required to determine whether the pairs of polygons were 
identical or not. Results show that a greater degree of 
graphical complexity implies longer reaction time. This 
outcome indicates that the process of mental rotation is the 
same for designers as for regular individuals – both groups 
use piecemeal processing.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 When encountering problems associated with 
graphics, designers often rotate images in their minds, 
trying to gauge the effects of different angles. How 
exactly does this process of image rotation work? Is the 
process different for designers than it is for regular 
individuals? These questions have been explored in 
previous studies, in which mental rotation was recognized 
as the ability to rotate mental representations of objects.  
The concept of mental rotation was proposed by 
Shepard and Metzler in 1971. Using two three-
dimensional objects at dissimilar angles, they asked 
participants to indicate whether the objects matched or not. 
Mental rotation ability was determined according to 
participants’ reaction time.  
Currently, there are two opinions regarding how the 
process of mental rotation is conducted. The first sees it as 
holistic processing, in which the transformation of the 
image is a unitary process; in other words, the image is 
holistically rotated once. The second see it as piecemeal 
processing, in which each component of the image is 
sequentially rotated in the mind.  
According to holistic processing, reaction time for 
mental rotation is not affected by the complexity or detail 
of the image. However, from the perspective of piecemeal 
processing, the degree of detail or complexity in the 
image influences reaction time. Researchers have 
expressed different opinions as to whether the process of 
mental rotation is holistic or piecemeal. Cooper and 
Shepard, for instance, indicated that mental rotation is a 
holistic process. In their study, they found that reaction 
times and determining angles were not affected by the 
complexity of the image [1]. Pylyshyn felt that mental 
rotation is a piecemeal process and that reaction time 
increases as image complexity and rotational angle 
increase [2].  
From the perspective of gender, males generally 
perform better in mental rotation tests compared to 
females [3] [4]. Other studies have found that males and 
females differ in the methods used for mental rotation; 
males tend to apply holistic processing, while females are 
more inclined to use piecemeal processing.  
Heil and Jansen-Osmann found that males and 
females utilize different strategies in the process of mental 
rotation. Males favor holistic processing while females 
tend to use piecemeal processing [5]. In their experiment, 
the complexity and rotational angle of polygons was 
manipulated, and participants were asked to determine 
whether the pairs of polygons matched or not. The 
reaction time of participants was recorded. Results show 
that complexity did not affect the reaction times of males. 
In other words, whether encountering simple or complex 
shapes, males required the same amount of time to 
mentally rotate the images to the same angle. For females 
however, greater complexity resulted in longer reaction 
time. These results show that the process of mental 
rotation is holistic for males; their reaction time does not 
change regardless of the complexity of the graphics. 
Mental rotation is a piecemeal process for females; a 
greater degree of complexity leads to lengthier reaction 
time.EEG activation patterns showed that males use 
holistic strategy in mental rotation [6], which supported 
the conclusions of Heil and Jansen-Osmann.       
With regard to age, previous studies have shown 
that young people employ piecemeal processing in mental 
rotation, whereas older people utilize holistic processing. 
Dror et al. manipulated simple and complex graphics at 
different rotational angles. Groups of younger and older 
subjects were asked to judge the similarity of the graphics, 
and their reaction times were recorded. Results showed 
that reaction time in the younger group differed according 
to the complexity of the graphics; however, reaction time 
was consistent in the older group. This shows that young 
people employ piecemeal processing during mental 
rotation, while older people use holistic processing [7].  
With to learning effectiveness, many studies have 
shown that the ability to perform mental rotation can be 
altered through training [8] [9]. Other studies have 
indicated that mental rotation ability can be enhanced via 
workplace training. Wanzel et al. found that test scores for 
mental rotation were associated with the operation of

Results of three-way ANOVA (2 (designer group 
and regular group) u 4(different angles) u 2 (simple and 
complex)) showed that the group effects were not 
significant: F(1, 38)=0.08, p=0.78. The effect of different 
angles was significant: F(3, 114)=52.113, p<0.001. The 
main effect of complexity was significant: F (1, 
38)=55.43, p<0.001. There was no interaction effect 
between group type and rotational angle: F(3, 114)=0.05, 
p=0.98, or between group type and the degree of 
complexity: F(1, 38)=1.488, p=0.23. There was also no 
interaction effect between rotational angle and the degree 
of complexity: F(3, 114)=2.52, p=0.06 or between group 
type/rotational angle/degree of complexity: F(3,114)=1.42, 
p=0.24.  
After confirming the absence of interaction effects, 
we compared the main effects. Because the main effect of 
different angles was significant, we conducted post hoc 
comparison. Results showed significant differences 
between 0° and 45° angles, and between 45° and 90° 
angles. No significant differences were found between the 
90° and 135° angles. Table 1 shows that reaction time 
increased significantly with an increase in rotational angle. 
The mean reaction time was 1572ms for simple polygons 
and 1953ms for complex polygons. This shows that more 
time was required to mentally rotate complex graphics.  
We conducted two-way mixed design ANOVA on 
simple and complex polygons, in order to determine the 
influence of group type and angle on reaction time. With 
regard to simple polygons, group type did not have a 
significant effect (F(1, 38)=0.81, p=0.38); however, 
rotational angle was a factor of significant influence (F(3, 
114)=63.41, p<0.001). There was no interaction effect 
between group type and rotational angle (F(3, 114)=1.24, 
p=0.30). We conducted post hoc comparison of different 
angles and found significant differences between 0° and 
45° angles, and between 45° and 90° angles. No 
significant differences were found between the 90° and 
135° angles. Two-way ANOVA results show that the two 
groups did not differ in reaction time. However, reaction 
time for all participants increased as rotational angle 
increased.    
With regard to complex polygons, group type did 
not have a significant effect (F(1, 38)=0.56, p=0.49); 
however, rotational angle was a factor of significant 
influence (F(3, 114)=25.23, p<0.001). There was no 
interaction effect between group type and rotational angle 
(F(3, 114)=0.47, p=0.71). We proceeded to conduct post 
hoc comparison of different angles. Results showed 
significant differences between 0° and 45° angles, and 
between 45° and 90° angles. No significant differences 
were found between the 90° and 135° angles. These 
results are similar to those of the simple polygon group: 
The two groups did not differ in reaction time; however, 
reaction time for all participants increased as rotational 
angle increased.    
The slope of reaction time shows that in the designer 
group, the mean reaction time per unit angle was 5.31ms 
for simple polygons and 6.42ms for complex polygons. In 
the regular group, the mean reaction time per unit angle 
was 5.01ms for simple polygons and 7.43ms for complex 
polygons. These results show that in both groups, the 
reaction time (per unit angle) for complex polygons 
exceeded that of simple polygons.  
 
 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
 
 The aim of this study was to determine whether 
designers use holistic or piecemeal processing in mental 
rotation. Results show that the complexity of graphics 
influenced the reaction time of participants. We also 
found that the reaction time (per unit angle) for complex 
polygons exceeded that of simple polygons. From the 
viewpoint of piecemeal processing, a greater degree of 
graphic complexity implies a longer process of mental 
rotation. The results of this study echoed the reasoning of 
this viewpoint. Therefore, we determined that designers 
use piecemeal processing during mental rotation. 
However, applying a holistic strategy to mental rotation 
generally results in shorter reaction time and sometimes 
even better performance. Some studies have discovered 
that good imagers use holistic strategy while poor imagers 
employ piecemeal strategy [13]. Because designers 
frequently utilize mental rotation in the process of training, 
they should theoretically be good imagers. Thus, they 
would be expected to employ holistic processing. 
However, the results of this study did not support this 
expectation. 
One possible reason may be that the participants in 
the designer group were all university students who 
lacked sufficient experience in design. Therefore, their 
mental rotation ability was no different from that of 
regular individuals. Statistical results also show that the 
designer group and regular group did not differ in mean 
reaction time. Another possible reason is that this study 
used 2D polygons, which made the tests less complex 
than  those  using  3D  polygons.  As  a  result,  the  test  may  
have been unable to reveal the differences in mental 
rotation ability between designers and regular individual. 
Using 3D tests, Peter et al. found that males performed 
better in mental rotation than females. However, when 2D 
tests were conducted, no significant difference between
