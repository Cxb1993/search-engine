Abstract   
 
The recent research and development on metallic glasses in Taiwan over the past decade is reviewed in this paper. The 
major focus was to develop tougher bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), bulk metallic glass composites (BMGCs), and thin 
film metallic glasses (THMGs), mostly in Zr and Mg based systems. Due to the Taiwan industry characteristics, 
metallic glasses are favored in the application for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), including micro- or 
nano-imprinting for optoelectronic devices and hologram patterns.

1.  Introduction 
Metallic glasses have been one of the extensive 
research subjects over the past twenty years. The unique 
properties such as high strength and hardness, special 
damping property, soft magnetic characteristics, and 
oxidation/corrosion resistance enable this new category 
of metallic materials to be applied for structural or 
functional applications. Before 1990’s the research and 
development (R&D) focuses of metallic glasses were 
mainly on the Au-Si and Pd based system. After the 
breakthrough in early 1990’s, many other systems such 
as La, Mg, and Zr based bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) 
were developed. So far, the existing and on-going efforts 
have developed numerous successful systems, including 
Zr, Fe, Mg, Au, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ni, Ti, Co, Al, Ce, Ca, La, 
and many other rare-earth based amorphous alloys, as 
reviewed in a number of review papers [1-5].  
In addition to the metallic glasses in the bulk form, 
recently, metallic glasses have been extended to the thin 
or thick film area, in an attempt to find applications in 
the micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). For such 
applications, the amorphous alloys sometimes need to be 
fabricated via the sputtering or other thin film processes. 
The as-deposited thin film metallic glasses (TFMGs) 
usually exhibit a uniform composition without 
micro-segregation, avoiding the possible local 
crystallization during the fabrication process.  
 The initial R&D activities of the BMGs and 
THMGs in Taiwan start from early 1990’s, in academic 
university such as National Tsing-Hua University and 
National Taiwan Ocean University, as well as in research 
institutes such as Industry Technology Research Institute 
(ITRI) and Chung-Shan (Military) Institute of Science 
and Technology. The initial R&D was aimed on the Zr, 
Mg and Fe based BMGs. Later research was 
continuously extended in several universities, such as 
National Sun Yat-Sen University, I-Shou University and 
National Taiwan Ocean University, together with the 
reinforcement from Metal Industries Research & 
Development Centre (MIRDC). The major joint efforts 
were lunched in 2000’s. An international collaboration 
project on metallic glasses was approved in 2005, 
covering eight research laboratories in National Sun 
Yat-Sen University, National Taiwan Ocean University, 
I-Shou University, National Cheng-Kung University and 
National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, 
as well four USA laboratories in Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory, University of Tennessee, and University of 
Wisconsin, Madison. MIRDC was also involved to 
promote industry applications.  
 
2.  Alloy design 
The initial alloy design was limited to the Zr based 
BMGs [6-13]. Effects of individual micro-alloying with 
Si (0~10 at%) or B (0~4 at%) on the thermal properties 
of the Zr65Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5 base alloy have been 
systematically investigated. It is found that the addition 
of either B or Si would posses a positive effect on 
thermal stability improvement of the base alloy, while 
keeping the same glass forming ability (GFA) as the base 
alloy. The largest activation energy of crystallization, 
about 360 kJ/mol, occurs at the compositions of 
Zr63Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5B2 and Zr61Cu17.5Ni10Al7.5Si4. 
Furthermore, the Zr65-x-yAl7.5 Cu17.5Ni10SixBy alloy system, 
where x = 0~4 and y = 0~2, was selected for studying the 
effect of simultaneously adding B (with a smallest 
atomic size) and Si (with a negative heat of mixing) on 
its crystallization and thermal stability. The experimental 
evidence and the kinetic analyses revealed that, with the 
addition of 4 at% Si and 1 at% B, the Trg (=Tg/Tl) and 
γ (=Tx/(Tg+Tl), where Tg, Tx, and Tl are the glass 
transition, crystallization, and liquidus temperature, 
respectively) values increase from 0.57 and 0.40 for the 
Zr65Al7.5Cu17.5Ni10 base alloy to 0.62 and 0.43, 
 4
temperature. In 2007, it was further developed some 
more reliable parameters, one is γm=(2Tx-Tg)/Tl [25,26], 
and the other is κ=∆Tx/Tx+ Tg/Tl [27]. The existing 
experimental data can be fit into the trend to confirm that 
the γm and κ parameters exhibit the best correlation with 
GFA among all parameters suggested so far for bulk 
metallic glasses, due to the fact that the new indicator 
considers all related factors for the liquid phase stability 
during cooling and the resistance to crystallization during 
heating.

composition cut between Al5Ni40Zr55 and Al5Cu25Zr70

 Fe based soft magnetic BMGs have been studied 
by Chin and his coworkers in National Tsing Hua 
University [28-30]. A new simple ternary Fe76B20Y4 
BMG rod measuring 2 mm in diameter was developed 
with a high saturation magnetization of 1.56 T, low 
coercivity less than 40 A/m, and high electrical 
resistivity larger than 200 mV.cm [28]. Other Fe based 
amorphous and nanocrystalline melt-spun ribbons with 
promising soft magnetic properties are continuously 
explored [29].  
In addition, the new ternary Ni-Ta-Sn ternary BMG 
system was also developed, with 33<Ta<38 and 2<Sn<9 
(in at%). The alloy shows a wide BMG forming regime. 
The crystallization temperature is among the highest in 
Ni based BMGs, with a wide supercooled liquid region 
57–61 K. This Ni-Ta-Sn BMG shows high hardness, 
typically Hv~1000, and a compressive fracture strength 
856–1192 MPa. The Ni58Ta36Sn6 BMG also exhibit good 
corrosion resistance in the anodic region [30].  
The synthesis and characteristics of the Mg based 
BMG composites (BMGCs) have been studied in I-Shou 
University [31-35]. The Mg based BMGCs are fabricated 
through mechanical alloying (MA) in the planetary mill, 
using amorphous Mg65Cu25-XY10Agx (x=0, 5, 10) matrix 
alloy prepared by melt spinning and 1-5 vol% spherical 
nano-sized ZrO2 particles. The melt spun amorphous 
matrix ribbons are ground into powders and mixed with 
the ZrO2 nano particles in the planetary mill, followed by 
hot pressing in Ar atmosphere under different pressures 
at the temperature 5 K above the glass transition 
temperature. Throughout the MA and hot pressing 
processes, the Mg based BMGCs exhibit an amorphous 
Mg65Cu20Y10Ag5 matrix microstructure with 80-nm nano 
ZrO2 particles homogeneously dispersed. The 
microstructure near the interface between the matrix and 
nano particles presents a well bonded condition. In 
addition, the hot-pressed composite can reach a 96% 
density, 360 in Hv hardness, and 700 MPa for the 
compressive strength. Moreover, the toughness of the 
Mg based BMGCs exhibit an increasing trend with 
increasing nano-sized ZrO2 content, and can reach a level 
of 8.9 MPa.m0.5 [32,33]. 
 
3.  Fabrication 
The fabricating routes for the BMGs in I-Shou 
University and National Sun Yat-Sen University are 
either injection or suction casting, with arc or induction 
furnace. For producing the Zr based (or CuZr based) 
BMGs, an atmosphere-controlled 
arc-melting/suction-casting process is the preferable way 
to prepare the Zr based alloys. The rods with dimension 
of 8 mm φ x 70 mm L and plates with dimension of 3 
mm T x 30 mm W x 60 mm L of the Zr based BMGs can 
be successfully fabricated by this method. On the other 
hand, for making the Mg based BMGs and BMGCs, 
two-steps atmosphere control induction melting and 
injection-casting process is in use to prepare the highly 
reactive and high vapor-pressured Mg based alloys. The 
rods with dimension of 10 mm φ x 60 mm L and plate 
with dimension of 2 mm T x 20 mm W x 60 mm L of the 
Mg based BMGs can be successfully prepared. Some 
examples are shown in Fig. 3.

and plates in various dimensions.

layered composite plate with a Gaussian-shape, and 300 
mm in diameter, 12 mm in maximum thickness, and 510 
g in mass [40]. 
 
Spray forming has also been applied to fabricate Al 
and Mg based amorphous plates measuring 1 to 10 mm 
in thickness in National Cheng Kung University [36-40]. 
Spray forming can be considered as an intermediate 
processing between casting and deposition, with a 
cooling rate in the range of 1-100 K/s. Spray forming 
was firstly employed to fabricate Al89La6Ni5 based 
BMGs and later Mg-Cu-Y or Mg-Cu-Gd systems, as 
 6
diameters of 0.7 to 4 μm [61]. The increment of strength 
is also analyzed in terms of the Weibull statistics. The 
extracted Weibull modulus is ~60 for this ductile 
phase-separated Zr BMGs [61], compared with the 
values ~35 and ~40 for the brittle Mg based BMGs [60] 
and Au49Ag5.5Pd2.3Cu26.9Si16.3 BMG [62]. These results 
are consistent with other reported Weibull modulus 
values for the malleable Zr48Cu45Al7 (m=73.4) [63] and 
brittle (Zr48Cu45Al7)98Y2 (m=25.5) [63]. It seems that the 
size dependence is related to the ductility and cast defect 
of the amorphous alloys.

micro-compression to about 30% strain [60]. 
 
5.  Toughening  
 The current critical issue for metallic glasses appears 
to be the toughening of their brittle nature. Based on 
previous efforts, the most promising approaches might 
be the enhancement of the Poisson ratio by tailoring the 
compositions, the employment of in-situ phase 
separation to form an amorphous matrix mixed with a 
dendrite crystalline phase (forming a dendrite-reinforced 
amorphous composite) or a second glassy phase (forming 
a dual-phased glass) [21-23]. Tremendous efforts have 
been made in terms of the above approaches. One is to 
form liquid phase separation at high temperatures during 
induction melting, followed by rapid quenching to form 
the phase-separated glass. Successful results in Zr based 
glasses (e.g., Zr63.8Ni16.2Cu15Al5 or Zr65.8Ni15.8Cu8.4Al10) 
have achieved compressive ductility over 30%, as shown 
in Fig. 9 [21]. Another approach is to employ the porous 
particles into the amorphous matrix to form an 
amorphous matrix composite. Successful results in Mg 
based glasses added with 5-25 volume percent of porous 
Mo particles (~30-50 μm) have achieved compressive 
ductility over 10%, as shown in Fig. 10 [64]. Both these 
two approaches are designed with the concept in 
separating the homogeneous glassy matrix into numerous 
individual compartments with smooth but distinctive 
interfaces. The complicated interaction of propagating 
shear bands with these compartments and interfaces 
would promote multiple shear banding and resulting in 
improved ductility. 
The gain of high compressive strength and 
remarkable macroscopic plastic strain of 30% in the 
phase-separated Zr63.8Ni16.2Cu15Al5 or 
Zr65.8Ni15.8Cu8.4Al10 is attributed to the unique glassy 
structure correlated with the chemical inhomogeneity on 
the micron scale; the hard phases surrounded by the soft 
phases, leading to an inherent capability of extensive 
shear-band formation, interactions, and multiplication 
[21-23]. The work shows that, by the two-liquid phase 
separation in accordance with the thermodynamic 
prediction, a good-GFA and ductile BMG can be 
achieved from the two-glassy-phase microstructure.  
Recent works on the Mg based BMGs added with 
micro-scaled Fe [65] or Ta [66] particles are under 
investigation. The BMGCs of these systems also show 
compression plasticity over 10%. The brittle nature of 
the Mg based BMGs can be sufficiently toughened by 
the Fe and Ta particles.

diameter cylinders. The inset shows the deformed sample

engineering stress-strain curves for the as-cast 2 mm 
diameter compression specimens. The curves are shifted 
relative to each other for clarity [64]. 
 
6.  Modeling  
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was applied 
for the structural evolution and mechanical response of 
the metallic glasses using the tight-binding potentials for 
the elements [53-56]. For the simulation for the ARB 
solid-state vitrification process, the molecular dynamics 
simulation reveals that it needs only 6 cycles for a 
bi-layer structure, with 5 nm in each layer thickness, to 
fully transform into a completely amorphous state, as 
shown in Fig. 11 [54]. The potential energy between two 
distinct atoms increases during the transition between 
nanocrystalline and amorphous state due to the severe 
structure change. It increases the difficulty for atoms to 
maintain the crystalline structures. The values of the 
nearest neighboring distance extracted from the 
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation 
and the MD simulation are both smaller than the 
theoretically calculated value. A new tighter packing 
atomic structure in the Zr50Ni50 amorphous alloy is 
formed due to the large negative mixing enthalpy. 
The gradual vitrification evolution of atom mixing 
and local atomic pairing structure of the binary Zr-Ni 
alloy during severe deformation at room temperature is

without the Zr47Cu31Al13Ni9 film. Arrows indicate the 
run-out data without the failure [70]. 
 
In addition, the fully amorphous thin films can be 
easily prepared by co-sputtering of the Zr-Cu or Zr-Cu-Ti 
systems [72,73]. Partial amorphous thin films can be 
achieved by co-sputtering of Mg-Cu system [74], or 
multilayer sputtering plus post-annealing in the Zr-Cu 
system [72].  
 
8.  Oxidation and corrosion  
The high-temperature oxidation behaviors of the Zr 
and Cu based BMGs in dry air or oxygen environment 
have been systematically examined by Kai and his group 
[76-82], including Zr53Ni23.5Al23.5 at 400-600°C [76], 
Cu60Hf25Ti15 at 375-520°C [77], Cu60Zr30Ti10 and 
Cu60Zr20Ti10Hf10 at 350-500°C [78], (Cu78Y22)98Al2 
amorphous composite at 400-600°C [79] and other 
systems [80-82]. For the Zr53Ni23.5Al23.5 system at 
400-600°C [76], the oxidation kinetics of the alloy 
follow the single- or two-stage parabolic rate law at T ≤ 
500°C, but could be fitted by a three-stage parabolic law 
at 550-600°C. They found the amounts of Al2O3 and 
monoclinic-ZrO2 in the scales increase with the oxidation 
temperature. Based on the crystallographic and 
microstructural characterization results, they suggest 
more complicated oxidation kinetics at the temperature 
near Tg (such as 500°C) and above; this might have 
resulted from the fact that crystallization of oxidation 
take place simultaneously. 
For the Cu60Hf25Ti15 system at 375-520°C [77], 
they found that the oxidation rates of the amorphous 
alloy are much higher than those of polycrystalline pure 
Cu, and suggested that the additions of Hf and Ti 
accelerate the oxidation reaction. To determine the 
oxidation mechanism of the alloy, marker studies 
performed at 425°C for 72 hours show Pt markers were 
always located on the scale surface, indicating that the 
oxidation mechanism is involved mainly inward 
diffusion of oxygen. In addition, they detected Cu51Hf14 
and Cu3Ti2 phases in X-ray diffraction (XRD) results, 
indicating the occurrence of phase transformation during 
the oxidation test. In comparing the Cu60Zr30Ti10 and 
Cu60Zr20Ti10Hf10 systems at 350-500°C [78], they found 
the addition of Hf slightly reduce the oxidation rate of 
alloy at 350-400°C while the reverse situation is 
observed at higher temperatures. The scales formed on 
both alloys were strongly composition dependent, 
consisting of mostly CuO/Cu2O and minor cubic-ZrO2 
and ZrTiO4 for the ternary BMG, and of CuO, 
cubic-ZrO2, and Zr5Ti7O24 for the quaternary BMG. 
They concluded that the formation of ZrTiO4 and 
Zr5Ti7O24 is responsible for the faster oxidation rates of 
these BMG alloys. 
In addition, the oxidation of the (Cu78Y22)98Al2 
amorphous composite containing Cu5Y at 400-600°C 
was also examined [79]. It is found that the 
Cu5Y-bearing composite has lower oxidation rates than 
those of the (Cu78Y22)98Al2 amorphous and pure Cu. The 
XRD and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
characterizations on scales formed during oxidation 
reveal that the scales formed on the Cu5Y-bearing 
composite consist of mainly hexagonal-Y2O3 and minor 
CuO. On the other hand, the scales on (Cu78Y22)98Al2 
amorphous alloy are largely Cu2O and CuO with minor 
amounts of Y2O3. Accordingly, they concluded that the 
presence of Cu2O is responsible for the poor oxidation 
properties of (Cu78Y22)98Al2 amorphous alloy. 
In addition to oxidation, the corrosion properties of 
the Pd, Fe and Cu based BMGs were also studied in 
Taiwan [83-86]. They evaluated the corrosion properties 
of these alloys in various aqueous solutions such as NaCl, 
HNO3, H2SO4, and HCl. They found that the alloys in 
amorphous state normally have better corrosion 
properties than those of crystalline state. For example, 
after crystallization by vacuum annealing at 650°C for 1 
hour, the corrosion resistance of the F40Ni38B18Mo4 alloy 
under its crystalline state becomes inferior to its 
amorphous state [83]. But for some other cases, they also 
reported that the corrosion resistance of amorphous alloy 
can be improved about two to three times by annealing. 
This is particularly found in the Pd40Ni40P20 alloy [84]. 
Their XRD result of the annealed sample shows the 
presence of several phosphides and palladium which 
behave as inert phases mixed with noble metal to 
enhance corrosion resistance. 
The corrosion behavior of the Ni58Ta36Sn6 1-mm 
BMG rods was measured in HCl aqueous solution, open 
to air at 25oC. The polarization curve of pure tantalum is 
also displayed to contrast with the Ni–Ta–Sn BMG. In 
anodic region, the alloy spontaneously passivates. After a 
potential larger than 0.3 V, a passivation current density 
is noted as being slightly lower than that of pure 
tantalum. The open-circuit potential of the glassy alloy is 
about 0.13 V, being nobler than that of pure tantalum 
[75]. 
In addition, they studied hydrogen permeation of 
amorphous Fe based alloys, focusing on alloying element 
effects [85]. They pointed out that the apparent solubility 
of hydrogen in Fe81B13.5Si3.5C2 is higher than that in 
Fe40Ni38B18Mo4 because of the hydrogen-trapping effect 
of carbon and silicon atoms. They further reported that 
the presence of smaller atoms of carbon and silicon 
results in decreases in hydrogen permeation rate and 
effective diffusivity in the Fe81B13.5Si3.5C2 alloy. 
Moreover, they evaluated the corrosion behavior of 
mechanically alloyed Cu60Zr30Ti10 BMG in different 
corrosive solutions using the potentiodynamic method 
[85]. The glassy alloy exhibits the most corrosion 
resistance in H2SO4 solution, while, in NaCl solution, 
there is the pit growth on the surface leading to 
breakdown of the passive film due to the galvanic 
 10
 Potential application of the Zr based BMG can be 
extended to the medical tool such as the surgical razor or 
micro-surgery scissors. Because the razor made by the Zr 
BMG presents much smoother edge than the razor made 
by martensitic stainless steel. One example is shown in 
Fig. 19 [96].

commercial surgical razor. Enlarged knife edge of the

S-15C blade [96].

K, (b) secondary electron image of SEM and surface 
profile of the imprinted hologram pattern [90].

pattern of the (Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.5Si0.5 BMG, (b) SEM 
images of circle A area in (a), (c) enlarges SEM image of 
circle B area in (b), and (d) surface profile of the 
imprinted hologram pattern [13]. 
 
Since both of the Zr based and Mg based BMGs 
present superior viscous flow behavior within their 
supercooled region. Therefore, these two BMGs can be 
applied to duplicate the hologram pattern via a 
micro-imprinting process. The replication of a hologram 
pattern with 100 nm depth was replicated by the 
Mg58Cu31Y6Nd5 BMG plate in the supercooled 
temperature region (Fig. 20) [90]. In addition, an 
imprinted hologram pattern with 0.6 μm depth also 
demonstrates extremely good microforming ability of the 
(Zr53Cu30Ni9Al8)99.5Si0.5 BMG, as shown in Fig. 21 [13].  
The other attractive aspect in using BMGs for 
micro-forming is the relatively low forming temperature. 
The Mg [97-100] and Au based BMGs [100] have low 
glass transition temperatures in the range of 140-160oC, 
making the viscous forming or imprinting easy to operate. 
The low forming temperature lies in the same 
temperature range for polymer materials such as PMMA, 
and the low forming temperature also prevent from the 
oxidation problem. The pressing can also be performed 
in air due to the low forming temperatures within 
140-160oC for the Mg and Au based BMGs. Successful 
micro-imprinting of the Mg58Cu31Y11 BMGs have 
achieved for making hexagonal micro-lens arrays. The 
original convex Ni-Mo mold made by electro-plating is 
pressed onto the BMG at 140-160oC for a few minutes at 
a low pressure in the range 0.1 to 1 MPa (Fig. 22(a) [98]). 
And the printed concave BMG mold is applied onto 
PMMA, forming a convex pattern. The results 
demonstrate that the imprinting is feasible and promising. 
The resulting hexagonal micro-lens arrays are shown in 
Fig. 22(b) [98]. Micro-scaled V-grove patterns (Fig. 22(c) 
[98]) can also be imprinted on the Mg [97-99] and Au 
based BMGs [100]. With the anti-oxidation, 
anti-corrosion, and good forming ability, the Au based 
BMG may be a material with high potential for micro 
electro mechanical systems (MEMS) applications.
