Abstract—The n-dimensional augmented cube, denoted as AQn, 
a variation of the hypercube, possesses some properties superior 
to those of the hypercube. In this paper, we show that every 
vertex in AQn lies on a fault-free cycle of every length from 4 to 
2n, even if there are up to 2n  3 link faults. We also show that 
this result is optimal.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A graph G is a triple consisting of a vertex set V(G), an 
edge set E(G), and a relation that associates with each edge 
two vertices called its endpoints [26]. We usually use a graph 
to represent the topology of an interconnection network 
(network for short). The hypercube is one of the most 
versatile and efficient interconnection networks discovered to 
date for parallel computation. The hypercube is ideally suited 
to both special-purpose and general-purpose tasks, and can 
efficiently simulate many other same sized networks [18]. We 
usually use Qn to denote an n-dimensional hypercube. Many 
variants of the hypercube have been proposed. The 
augmented cube, recently proposed by Choudum and Sunitha 
[5], is one of such variations. An n-dimensional augmented 
cube AQn can be formed as an extension of Qn by adding some 
links. For any positive integer n, AQn is a vertex transitive, (2n 
 1)-regular, and (2n  1)-connected graph with 2n vertices. 
AQn retains all favorable properties of Qn since Qn  AQn. 
Moreover, AQn possesses some embedding properties that Qn 
does not. Previous works relating to the augmented hypercube 
can be found in [2], [5], [14], [15], [16], [19], [20], [23], [25].  
Linear arrays and rings, two of the most fundamental 
networks for parallel and distributed computation, are 
suitable for developing simple algorithms with low 
communication costs. Many efficient algorithms designed 
based on linear arrays and rings for solving a variety of 
algebraic problems and graph problems can be found in [18]. 
The pancyclicity of a network represents its power of 
embedding rings of all possible lengths. A graph G is called 
m-pancyclic whenever G contains a cycle of each length l for 
m  l  |V(G)|. A 3-pancyclic graph is called pancyclic. The 
arrangement graph [7], the hypercomplete network [6], the 
WK-recursive network [10], the alternating group graph [17], 
and the hyper-de Bruijn networks [11] are all pancyclic. A 
graph G is m-vertex-pancyclic (respectively,

m-edge-pancyclic) if every vertex (respectively, edge) lies on 
a cycle of every length from m to |V(G)|. In addition, a 
3-vertex-pancyclic graph (respectively, 3-edge-pancyclic 
graph) is called vertex-pancyclic (edge-pancyclic). It is clear 
that if a graph G is m-edge-pancyclic, then it is 
m-vertex-pancyclic. The crossed cube [8], the twisted cube 
[9], and the möbius cube [24] are 4-edge-pancyclic. The 
recursive circulant graphs with some condition [1], the 
alternating group graph [3], and the augmented cube [20] are 
edge-pancyclic.  
Since faults may occur to networks, the fault tolerance of 
networks is an important issue in designing network topologies. 
Let Fe  E(G) (respectively, Fv  V(G)) denote the faulty 
edges (respectively, the faulty vertices) in a graph G and let F 
= Fe  Fv. Suppose that G  F is P, where P is m-pancyclic, 
pancyclic, vertex-pancyclic, m-vertex-pancyclic, 
edge-pancyclic, or m-edge-pancyclic. Then, we call G |F| 
fault-tolerant P. In addition, G is |F|-edge fault-tolerant P 
(respectively, |F|-vertex fault-tolerant P) if F = Fe 
(respectively, if F = Fv). Note that if G is |F| fault-tolerant P, 
then G is |F|-edge fault-tolerant P and |F|-vertex fault-tolerant 
P. Previously, the pancyclicity on various faulty networks was 
studied in [4], [12], [20], [21], [22], [23]. In [23], AQn has been 
shown to be (2n  3) fault-tolerant pancyclic, where n  4. Up 
to now, there is no research to concern fault-tolerant 
vertex-pancyclicity or fault-tolerant edge-pancyclicity. In this 
paper, we show that AQn  Fe is 4-vertex-pancyclic if |Fe|  2n 
 3, where n  2. That is, we show that AQn is (2n  3)-edge 
fault-tolerant 4-vertex-pancyclic, where n  2. In addition, we 
also show that this result is optimal.  
 
II. PRELIMINARIES 
Let G be a graph and let u, v  V(G). The degree of vertex 
v in G, written as degG(v), is the number of edges incident to v 
in G. In addition, (G) = min{degG(v)| v  V(G)}. A path P[x0, 
xt] = x0, x1, , xt is a sequence of nodes such that two 
consecutive nodes are adjacent. t is the distance between 
nodes x0 and xt if P[x0, xt] is a shortest path in G. We use 
0( , )G td x x  to denote the distance between x0 and xt in G, and 
use (u, v) to denote an edge whose endpoints are u and v. 
Moreover, a path x0, x1, , xt may contain other subpaths, 
denoted as x0, x1, , xi, P[xi, xj], xj, , xt, where P[xi, xj] = xi, 
xi+1, ,xj–1, xj. A cycle is a path with x0 = xt and t  3. A cycle 
(respectively, path) in G is called a Hamiltonian cycle 
(respectively, Hamiltonian path) if it contains every vertex of 
G exactly once.

Case 1.1: 4  l  2n1. Since |F0| = 0, by the induction

Figure 2.  Construction of a cycle of length l  {4, 5, … , 2n  1} in AQn  F 
with F  E(AQn) and |F| = 2n  3 
 
Case 1.2.1: n = 3. We have l = 5 or 6. First, consider that l 
= 5. Since |Fc|  |F| = 3 and |V(
1
2AQ )| = 4, we can find a vertex 
x  1
2AQ  such that (x, x
a
), (x, x
h
)  Fc. In addition, by 
Lemma 5, there is a Hamiltonian path P[x
h
, x
a
] (with length 3) 
in 0
2AQ  (thus, z  V(P[x
h
, x
a
])). The desired cycle of length l 
= 5 can be constructed by x, xh, P[xh, xa], xa, x. 
Now consider that l = 6. Let (x, y)  E( 1
2AQ   F) such that 
|{(x, x
a
), (x, x
h
)}  Fc|  1, |{(y, y
a
), (y, y
h
)}  Fc|  1, x
a
  yh,  
and x
h
  ya 1. Let (x, x'), (y, y')  E(AQ3)  Fc, where x'  
{x
a
, x
h
} and y'  {ya, yh}. Clearly, x'  y'. By   
 
 
1 Note that if (x, y)  S ={(100, 111), (101, 110)}, then xa  yh and xh  ya. 
The existence of such an edge can be reasoned as follows. If we have |{(v, va), 
(v, vh)}  Fc|  1 for all v  V( 1
2AQ
), then |E( 1
2AQ
  F  S)|  1 and the result 
follows. If there is a vertex t with |{(t, ta), (t, th)}  Fc| = 2, then we have |{(v, 
va), (v, vh)}  Fc|  1 for all v  V( 1
2AQ   {t}) and |F1|  |F|  |Fc| = 1. Since 
|E( 1
2AQ
  {t})  S| = 2, we have |E( 1
2AQ
  {t})  S  F1|  1 and the result 
follows. 
Lemma 5, there is a Hamiltonian path P[y', x'] (with length 
3) in 0
2AQ . The desired cycle of length l = 6 can be 
constructed by x, y, y', P[y', x'], x', x. 
Case 1.2.2: n  4. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a 
cycle C0 in 
0
1nAQ    F0 such that z  V(C0), where 2
n1
  1  
|V(C0)|  2
n1
. Moreover, let (x, y)  E(C0) such that (x, x
h
), (y, 
y
h
), (x
h
, y
h
)  F or (x, xa), (y, ya), (xa, ya)  F2 (note that by 
Lemma 3, (x
h
, y
h
) and (x
a
, y
a
) are also edges in 1
1nAQ  ). 
Additionally, let P[x, y] = C0  {(x, y)} and l0 =|E(P[x, y])|. 
(Thus, we have 2
n1
  2  l0  2
n1
  1.) Let (x', y')  {(xh, yh), 
(x
a
, y
a
))} such that (x, x'), (y, y'), (x', y')  E(AQn)  F. The 
desired cycle of length l = l0 + 3  {2
n1
 + 1, 2
n1
 + 2} can be 
constructed by x, P[x, y], y, y', x', x (see Figure 2(a)).  
Case 1.3: 2
n1
 + 3  l  2n  1. We have three scenarios as 
follows:  
Case 1.3.1: |F1|  2n  5. By Lemma 2, there exists a 
Hamiltonian cycle C1 in 
1
1nAQ    F1. Let P[x, y] be the 
subpath of C1 with length l1 such that (x, x
h
), (y, y
h
)  Fc or (x, 
x
a
), (y, y
a
)  Fc, where 2  l1  2
n1
  2 3. Let x' {xh, xa}, y' 
{yh, ya}, and (x, x'), (y, y')  Fc. Since |F0| = 0, by Lemma 2, 
there exists a Hamiltonian path P[y', x'] in 0
1nAQ    F0 
(certainly, z  V(P[y', x'])). The desired cycle of length l = 
2
n1
  1 + 2 + l1  {2
n1
+ 3, 2
n1
+ 4, …, 2n  1} can be 
constructed by x, P[x, y], y, y', P[y', x'], x', x (see Figure 
2(b)).  
Case 1.3.2: |F1| = 2n  4 (thus, |Fc| = 1). Let ( x , y )  F1. 
Then |F1  {( x , y )}| = 2n  5. By Lemma 2, there exists a 
cycle C1 in 
1
1nAQ    (F1  {( x , y )}), where 3  |V(C1)|  
2
n1
  1. If ( x , y )  E(C1), then let x = x  and y = y . If ( x , 
y )  E(C1), then randomly choose an edge (x, y)  E(C1). 
Since |Fc| = 1, we have (x, x
h
), (y, y
h
)  Fc or (x, x
a
), (y, y
a
)  Fc. 
Let P[x, y] = C  {(x, y)} and let l1 be the length of P[x, y]. 
(Thus, we have 2  l1  2
n1
  2.) Let (x', y')  {(xh, yh), (xa, 
y
a
))} such that (x, x'), (y, y')  E(AQn)  Fc. Since |F0| = 0, by 
Lemma 2, there exists a Hamiltonian path P[y', x'] in 0
1nAQ    
F0 (certainly, z  V(P[y', x'])). The desired cycle of length l = 
(2
n1
  1) + 2 + l1  {2
n1
+ 3, 2
n1
+ 4, …, 2n  1} can be 
constructed by x, P[x, y], y, y', P[y', x'], x', x (see Figure 
2(c)).  
Case 1.3.3: |F1| = 2n  3 (thus, |Fc| = 0). First, consider that 
( 1
1nAQ    F1) = 0. Clearly, exactly one vertex s in 
1
1nAQ    
F1 has degree 0, F1 = {(s, t)| t  V(
1
1nAQ  )}, and F  (
1
1nAQ   
 {s}) = . By Lemma 6, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle C1 
in 1
1nAQ    {s} (thus, |V(C1)| = 2
n1
  1). Let P[x, y] be the 
subpath of C1 with length l1, where 2  l1  2
n1
  2. The 
construction is similar to that of Case 1.3.1.  
Now, consider that ( 1
1nAQ    F1)  1. Let x, y, u, v be 
distinct and (x, y), (u, v)  F1. Then, |F1  {(x, y), (u, v)}| = 2n 
 5. By Lemma 2, there exists a cycle C1 in 1 1nAQ    (F1  {(x, 
 
2 Since |E(C0)|  2
n1  1, we have at least 2n1  1 choices. If such an edge 
does not exist, then |F|  2n1  1> 2n  3 when n  4, which is a 
contradiction. 
3 Since |E(C1)| = 2
n1, we have at least 2n1 choices. If such a path does not 
exist, then |F|  2n1 > 2n  3 when n  3, which is a contradiction. 
 and v' = y'. Otherwise, let (u, v)  E(C0) such that (u, u
h
), (v, 
v
h
), (u
h
, v
h
)  F, and let u' = uh and v' = vh. Let P[u, v] = C0  
{(u, v)} and l0 =|E(P[u, v])|. (Thus, we have 3  l0  2
n1
  1.) 
The desired cycle of length l = l0 + 3  {6, 7, …, 2
n1
 + 2} can 
be constructed by u, P[u, v], v, v', u', u (see Figure 3(a)).  
Since |F1|  1, by Lemma 7, there exists a path P[v', u'] of 
length 2 in 
1
1nAQ    F. Let l0 = 2
n1
  1; the desired cycle of 
length l = l0 + 4 = 2
n1
 + 3 can be constructed by u, P[u, v], v, 
v', P[v', u'], u', u (see Figure 3(b)).  
Also, since |F1|  1, by Lemma 2, there exists a Hamiltonian 
path P[v', u'] in 1
1nAQ    F. The desired cycle of length l = l0 + 
2 + 2
n1
  1  {2n1 + 4, 2n1 + 5, …, 2n  1} can be 
constructed by u, P[u, v], v, v', P[v', u'], u', u (see Figure 
3(c)). 
 
Case 4: |F0| = 2n  3. Thus, |F1| = |Fc| = 0. Two cases are 
further considered:  
Case 4.1: 4  l  2n1 + 1. Remember that zh is a neighbor of 
z
a
; that is, 
1
1
( , )
n

AQ
d z z

 = 1. By Lemma 1, there exists a path 
P[z
h
, z
a
] of length l1 in 
1
1nAQ  , where 1  l1  2
n1
  1. 
Therefore, the desired cycle of length l = l1 + 2  {3, 4, … , 
2
n1
 + 1} can be constructed by z, zh, P[zh, za], za, z (see 
Figure 4(a)).  
Case 4.2: 2
n1
 + 2  l  2n  1. We have the following 
scenario:  
Case 4.2.1: ( 0
1nAQ    F0) = 0. Clearly, exactly one vertex 
v in 
0
1nAQ    F0 has degree 0, for otherwise, |F0|  2(2n  3) 
 1 = 4n  7 > 2n  3. Moreover, F0 = {(v, u)| u  V(
0
1nAQ  )} 
and F  E( 0
1nAQ    {v}) = . By Lemma 6, there exists a 
Hamiltonian cycle C in 0
1nAQ    {v}. Thus, we have |E(C)| = 
2
n1
  1. Let (x, y)  E(C), and P[x, y] = C  {(x, y)}. Then, the 
length of P[x, y] is 2
n1
  2. By Lemma 1, there exists a path 
P[y
h
, x
h
] of length l1 in 
1
1nAQ  , where 2  l1  2
n1
  1. The 
desired cycle of length l = l1 + 2
n1
  2 +2  {2n1 + 2, 2n1 + 
3, …, 2n  1} can be constructed by x, P[x, y], y, yh, P[yh, xh], 
x
h
, x (see Figure 4(b))  
Case 4.2.2: ( 0
1nAQ    F0) = 1. First, consider that n = 3. 
It is easy to construct a path P[x, y] of length 2 in 0
2AQ   F0 
by hand such that z  V(P[x, y]) for some vertices x, y in 
0
1nAQ  . By  
Lemma 1, there exists a path P[y
h
, x
h
] of length l1 in 
1
2AQ , 
where 1  l1  3. The desired cycle of length l = l1 + 2 +2  {5, 
6, 7} can be constructed by x, P[x, y], y, yh, P[yh, xh], xh, x. 
Now consider that n  4. There is at most one vertex x with 
degree 1 in 0
1nAQ    F0, for otherwise, |F0|  2(2n  4)  1 = 4n 
 9 > 2n  3, which is a contradiction. Let (x, y)  F0. Then, 
we have ( 0
1nAQ    (F0  {(x, y)})) = 2 and |F0  {(x, y)}| = 2n 
 4. By Lemma 8, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle C in 
0
1nAQ    (F0  {(x, y)}). Obviously, (x, y)  E(C). Let P[x, y] 
= C  {(x, y)}. Then, the length of P[x, y] is 2n1  1. By 
Lemma 1, there exists a path P[y
h
, x
h
] of length l1 in 
1
1nAQ  , 
where 1  l1  2
n1
  2. The desired cycle of length l = l1 + 2
n1
 
 1 +2  {2n1 + 2, 2n1 + 3, …, 2n  1} can be constructed by 
x, P[x, y], y, yh, P[yh, xh], xh, x (see Figure 4(c)).  
Case 4.2.3: ( 0
1nAQ    F0)  2. We have n  4. Let (u, v)  
F0. Clearly, (
0
1nAQ    (F0  {(u, v)}))  2 and |F0  {(u, v)}| 
= 2n  4. By Lemma 8, there exists a Hamiltonian cycle C in 
0
1nAQ    (F0  {(u, v)}). If (u, v)  E(C), then let x = u and y 
= v. If (u, v)  E(C), then randomly choose an edge (x, y)  
E(C). The rest of the construction is the same as that of Case 
4.2.2.  

Figure 4.   Construction of a cycle of length l  {4, 5, … , 2n  1} in AQn 

Note that there are distributions of 2n  2 edge faults over a 
AQn such that no fault-free Hamiltonian cycle can be found in 
the faulty AQn, since AQn is (2n  1)-regular. Moreover, there 
are distributions of n edge faults over an AQn such that no 
fault-free cycle of length three can be found. Consider that a

 (n consecutive 0’s). Suppose that F = {(u, 
i
au )| i 
 {1, 2, …, n  1}}  {(u, un)}. Thus, (u, ui)  F, for all i  
{1, 2, …, n  1}. Since ui is not a neighbor of uj, for all i, j  
{1, 2, …, n  1} and i  j, u cannot lie on a cycle of length 3. 
Therefore, our result is optimal.

一、參加會議經過： 
IMECS是一個由國際工程師協會(IAENG，International Association of Engineers)創辦
的一個每年的三月都會在香港舉辦的一個常態性國際學術會議。此會議聚焦在工程
與計算機科學之理論與應用上之尖端議題，每次的會議大概有上千人參與。可見此
國際學術會議有其一定的影響力，所以此次投稿並參加此會議。此會議於 2011年 3
月 16日至 2011年 3月 18日在香港帝苑酒店(Regal Kowloon Hotel)舉行，在研討會
會場上，本人所參與的論文投稿為計算機科學的領域(The 2011 IAENG International 
Conference on Computer Science ( ICCS ))。  
 
二、與會心得：
