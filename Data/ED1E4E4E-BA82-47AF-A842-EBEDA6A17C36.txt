kinematics of the biped robot can be derived.  The forward 
kinematics can solve the pose (the position and orientation 
of every link) of the biped robot from joint angles.

In right support phase, the pose of the biped robot can 
be figured out by its forward kinematics.  The derived 
forward kinematics calculates every link position and 
orientation of the biped robot in right support phase as 
shown in Fig. 2.  Fig. 2 also demonstrates that the derived 
kinematics is correct.  Since the biped robot is symmetric, 
the pose of left support can be obtained as well. 
3.  TRAJECTORY PLANNING OF THE BIPED 
ROBOT 
Continuity in time is the basic need of trajectory 
planning of biped robots.  There are many polynomials 
used for the trajectory planning such as three cubic, five 
cubic, and 4-3-4, etc.  In this study, the 4-3-4 polynomial 
for the trajectory planning of the biped robot is proposed.  
The 4-3-4 polynomial has three functions of time as 
follows ( ) 10112123134141 atatatatath ++++=  (1) ( ) 20212223232 atatatath +++=  (2) 
( ) 01223344 ffffff atatatatath ++++=  (3) 
The three polynomials pass four locations of joint angles.  
Let the four locations be (t0, θ0), (t1, θ1), (t2, θ2), and (tf, θf), 
the initial angle velocity and acceleration are ω0, and α0, 
respectively, and the final angle velocity and acceleration 
are ωf and αf, respectively.  In total, the three polynomials 
need fourteen boundary conditions.  In addition to the 
above eight conditions, the rest six conditions is the 
constraints of the polynomials continuous at lift-up 
location θ1 and set-down location θ2.  A numerical 
example as θ0 = 0°, θ1 = 20°, θ2 = 75°, θf = 90°, ω0 = 0, α0, 
= 0, ωf = 0, and αf = 0 between the time step t0 = 0, t1 = 2, 
t2 = 7, tf = 10 is shown in Fig. 3.

trajectory.

It is not enough to just use one 4-3-4 polynomial for a 
smooth joint trajectory of the biped robot.  Every one of 
joint trajectory consists of two 4-3-4 polynomials.  Tow 
4-3-4 polynomials have seven interpolating points to 
assign the joint angles.  The previous four points consist 
of the first polynomial, and the posterior four points 
consist of the second polynomial. 
leg and the thigh and knee of swing leg is of four DoFs as 
shown in Fig. 7.  As shown in Fig. 8, six DoFs include the 
ankle, knee and thigh of both support and swing leg.  The 
manipulation of the biped robot DoFs is related to the 
structure of its mechanism.  This study provides the idea to 
design the mechanism of a biped robot. 
The manipulation of two DoFs is the simplest walking 
of the biped robot.  The ankle supports the robot, and the 
thigh swing the leg for a walking stride.  However, this 
manipulation limits the walking type of the biped robot. 
Support Leg Swing Leg

DoFs. 
 
Fig. 8.  The manipulation of the biped robot in six 
DoFs. 
The 2-DoFs manipulation operates joint (θ2) and Joint 
5 (θ8) as the biped in right support phase, and operates 
joint 11 (θ11) and joint 5 (θ5).  Besides, the rest joints of the 
biped robot are fixed.  Suppose a stride of the 2-DOFs 
manipulation is 270 mm.  Let the set points of θ2 be 0°, 0°, 
0°, 0°, -1°, -5°, -12°, and those of θ8 be 30°, 20°, 10°, 0°, -
10°, -20°, -30° as the biped in right support phase, and 
those of θ5 be 30°, 20°, 10°, 0°, -10°, -20°, -30°, and those 
of θ11 be 0°, 0°, 0°, 0°, -1°, -5°, -12° in left support phase.  
The two 4-3-4 polynomials and forward kinematics can be 
used to calculate the soles of both right and left legs as 
shown in Fig. 9. 
Adding the operation of knee in the 2-DoFs 
manipulation is four DoFs.  Thus, θ2, θ3, θ8 and θ10 are 
operated in right support phase, but θ3, θ5, θ10 and θ11 are 
operated in left support phase. 
Suppose a stride of the 4-DoFs manipulation is 300 
mm.  Let the set points be θ2 = 5°, 0°, 0°, 0°, -5°, -12°, -24°, 
θ3 = 25°, 10°, 0°, 0°, 0°, 10°, 30°, θ8 = -15°, -5°, 8°, 15°, 
20°, 25°, 25°, θ10 = -40°, -40°, -40°, -40°, -35°, -30°, -10° 
in right support phase, and be θ3 = 40°, 40°, 40°, 40°, 35°, 
30°, 10°, θ5 = 15°, 5°, -8°, -15°, -20°, -25°, -25°, θ10 = -25°, 
-10°, 0°, 0°, 0°, -10°, -30°, θ11 = -50°, 0°, 0°, 0°, 5°, 12°, 
24°，  in left support phase.  Then, the twp 4-3-4 
polynomials and forward kinematics can be used to draw 
out the trajectories of both right and left soles as shown in 
Fig. 10.

Fig. 11.  The trajectories of both right and left soles as 
manipulating the biped robot in six DoFs. 
The 6-DoFs manipulation like the style of human 
walking is most easy planning in biped robot walking.  
Suppose a stride of the 6-DoFs manipulation is 330 mm.  
Let the set points of concerned joints be θ2 = 26.5°, 18°, 
0°, 0°, 0°, -15°, -30°, θ3 = 10°, 7°, 0°, 0°, 0°, 25°, 40°, θ5

different DoFs.  As shown in Fig. 14, the three trajectories 
is almost consistent, but the trajectory of 6-DoFs 
manipulation is following the traces between those of 2-
DoFs and 4-DoFs manipulation.  i. e. The trajectory of 6-
DoFs is not too slow and not too fast.

Fig. 16.  The potential trajectories of different DoFs. 
Finally, the motion energy of the biped robot 
manipulated by the three DoFs is compared.  First, the 
kinetic energy is compared in Fig. 15.  Fig. 15 shows the 
trajectories of the kinetics and force changed with respect 
to time.  As shown in Fig. 15, it is amazing that the 2-DoFs 
manipulation almost spends the least energy except the 
swing leg in the period on ground.  In the comparison of 
total spending kinetics, the manipulation of two, four and 
six DoFs are 0.0713 (J), 0.0735 (J), and 0.0771 (J), 
respectively.  It is obvious that two DoFs is of the least 
spending.  Then the potential energy is compared in Fig. 
16.  Fig. 16 shows the trajectories of potential energy 
changed with respect to time.  As shown in Fig. 16, there is 
no obvious difference of the three different DoFs, but as 
comparing with the change range of potential energy, the 
6-DoFs manipulation is the largest one.  As comparing the 
different potential between initial and final locations, the 
manipulation of two, four and six DoFs is -2.1923 (J), -
2.1927 (J) and -2.1921 (J), respectively. They are almost 
consistent, because their initial and final locations are the 
same.  In summary, the 2-DoFs manipulation spends the 
least kinetic energy because of the simplest structure.  But 
the simplest structure makes unsmooth motion.  Four and 
six DoFs let the manipulation be smooth, but spend much 
kinetic energy, and make the operation more complicated.  
7.  CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT 
It is interested to study the difference of a biped robot 
manipulated by different DoFs.  In this study the analysis 
and comparison aim at the point of view form motion 
energy.  It is amazing for the study results of the biped 
robot manipulated by two, four and six DoFs, 
respectively.  Even if the 6-DoFs manipulation performs 
smooth trajectory, the spending of kinetic energy is the 
largest one.  The 2-DoFs manipulation achieves the 
walking a little stupid, the spending of motion energy is 
the smallest one.  In addition to the smallest motion 
energy, 2-DoFs biped robots possess the advantages of 
simple structure and easy control.  It is great hopeful for 
the development of 2-DoFs biped robots in the future. 
Biped robots are the integration research including 
mechanism design, motor control, sensing fusion, and so 
on.  It is worthful to study from the infrastructure to 
advance of the biped robot development.
