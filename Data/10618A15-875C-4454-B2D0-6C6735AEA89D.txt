Abstract 
In this report, we combine single carrier 
space time block transmission with multi 
user CDMA in frequency selective fading 
channels. At the receiver, we employed low 
complexity iterative MMSE multi-user 
detection to suppress interference. Besides, in 
order to increase data rate, we adopted the 
concept of super orthogonal codes. At the 
transmitter, by combining super-orthogonal 
block code, CDMA signaling together with 
single carrier transmission, we propose a new 
space-time block code framework at the 
transmit side. Taking two transmit antennas 
as an example, this structure needs to have 
two spreading sequences to not only 
distinguish different users but also hold 
orthogonality for linear processing. The 
receiver, based on these user specific 
sequences, intends to differentiate the active 
users by invoking the “turbo principle” 
decoding based on the serially concatenated 
coding. A soft input soft output (SISO) 
interference suppressor for each user is first 
derived in minimum mean square error sense 
to provide the reliabilities of code bits, 
assuming the channel state information is 
known precisely at the receiver. The resulting 
extrinsic information for coded bit streams is 
passed through a bank of single-user 
decoders after being deinterleaved. 
Simulation results demonstrate system 
performance in terms of bit error probability 
with variant ratio of the number of users to 
spreading length. Besides, the performance

三、研究結果與討論 
  We now present the performance results 
for SC-STBC-CDMA system. The binary 
convolutional code with code rate 2/4 
employed by each user is characterized by 
the constraint length 8[3 1]   and generator 
polynomial matrix 8[7 5 0 ; 0 01]       and the trellis 
termination is performed at the end of each 
transmitted data frame. All users use 
different interleavers generated randomly and 
the same interleavers were employed for all 
simulations using the same data frame size of 
128 bits and theta θ  was fixed at [0 π ]. No 
attempt was made to optimize the interleaver. 
Random spreading codes were utilized 
except for Fig. 6. We assume that the length 
of cyclic prefix is longer than delay spread. 
In the meanwhile, channel is normalized to 1 
for one-to-one transmit and receiver antenna. 
For simplicity, we will focus on the 
simulations for 2-transmitter antennas and 
1-receiver antenna. Lowest cardinality of 
PSK signaling is considered. The channels in 
all simulations are dispersive and the 
amplitude of each multipath component is 
considered to be Rayleigh fading and 
randomly generated at each run. Each user 
has seven paths and each of them is assumed 
to have random delays ranging from 0 to L 
symbol times. The spreading factor is 
denoted by M. Under identical power and 
bandwidth efficiencies, our proposed method 
outperforms conventional MIMO-OFDM 
CDMA systems around 6 dB at BER of 10-2 
as shown in Fig. 3. It is seen that BER curve 
of 2 users with random codes could quite 
follow single user bound in Fig. 4. After few 
iterations, we could see the BER curves of 
our proposed method could be close to the 
performance in flat fading channels about 2 
dB loss at BER of 10-3, as was demonstrated 
in Fig. 5. Finally, in Fig. 6, use of Hadamard 
sequences could have better performance 
than random sequences because of the 
existence of orthogonality property. 
四、計畫成果自評 
We proposed a single-carrier STBC-CDMA 
system suitable for high-speed wireless data 
transmission over frequency-selective 
channels. Cardinality of space-time 
modulation could be increased by taking 
advantage of the property of multi-sequence 
signaling. A low-complexity iterative 
frequency-domain equalization approach was 
addressed to suppress MAI along with ISI.

It is seen that within a few iterations our 
proposed soft receiver could approach single 
user bound under certain circumstances. 
Moreover, through computer simulations our 
proposed scheme could outperform 
conventional OFDM-CDMA systems in 
terms of BER. In essence, our algorithm 
provides a flexible means to select code rate 
and number of spreading codes per user to 
adapt to multi-access channel condition for 
system capacity improvements.
