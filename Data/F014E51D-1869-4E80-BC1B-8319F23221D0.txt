reliable measurements, and thus three-dimensional 
craniofacial reconstruction (3D-CFR). It may take 
multiple cephalometric images of different sides, 
determine the features that match and then perform 
alignment, and construct the corresponding three-
dimensional surface of the face. With help of 
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) technology, both the surface and the 
underlying hard tissue can be captured and visualized 
in three dimension. 
In this project, we propose computerized methods to 
perform image segmentation, feature extraction, 
landmark matching and identification, three-
dimensional reconstruction from two-dimensional 
images of cephalometry or surface scan, and 
visualization. Several image segmentation techniques, 
such as symmetric region grow, mean shift, level set 
modeling, etc., will be examined and implemented. An 
improved robust and fast iterative closest point 
(ICP) algorithm will be proposed to hierarchically 
match and identify rigid and non-rigid cephalometric 
landmarks. We shall build a software platform to 
accommodate the implemented methods as components. 
Components are grouped together to perform certain 
task and is archived in a configuration script that 
records the sequence of the process and the 
corresponding parameter settings.

the algorithms of symmetric region grow, level set modeling, mean shift, and semi-automatic extraction of 
features. All of these methods also serve as components that can be easily plugged into the proposed software 
platform. At the same time, development of the same components on Amira proceeds in parallel. Such 
additional implementation will facilitate the comparison of the proposed platform with the commercial Amira. 
Late in the second year and in most of the third year, we shall realize the improved ICP, perform matching and 
identification between images over time, or images from the normal and abnormal. Later in the third year, we 
shall perform unit/integration/system testing on the components and software platform with realistic image 
data in hope to disclose random errors and make system refinement. The scalability of the (component-based) 
software platform is also one of our major emphases to assure usability for further research on more biological 
and medical/clinical applications. 
2. 研究目的與文獻探討 
Cephalometry has been well accepted as a radiographic technique for portraying the human head in terms of 
measurable geometry [1]. It can be employed to depict the craniofacial morphology of a side, e.g., frontal or 
lateral, and to study the bony structure of the face for diagnosis, treatment planning/evaluation, and growth 
prediction and monitoring [2,3]. The inherent limitation of cephalometry is, however, its two-dimensional 
nature which exhibits great variability in relationship measurements of cephalometric landmarks, such as the 
distance between gnathion and zygomaticotemporal points [4,5]. Three-dimensional craniofacial imaging 
presents more promising and reliable measurements, and thus three-dimensional craniofacial reconstruction 
(3D-CFR) [6,7,8]. Traditional non-computer-assisted craniofacial reconstruction is heavily rendered in 
forensic science in identifying corpse [8]: CFR is justified by the fact that the skull can be considered as a 
matrix of the living head supporting the soft tissue. It may take multiple cephalometric images of different 
sides (e.g., frontal, left or right lateral), determine the features that match, perform alignment in hope to 
minimize matching errors, and construct the corresponding three-dimensional surface of the face. Besides 
cephalometric images, facial laser scanning servers a promising means to reconstruct three-dimensional facial 
surface in that it does not involve any radiation. By using structured lights emitted from beside, usually, a pair 
of calibrated and position-adjusted cameras, the laser surface scan can generate three-dimensional frontal and 
 4
region-growing process from seed points [23]. Higgins et al. proposed a three-dimensional seeded 
region-growing method [32]. Hojjatoleslami et al. introduced new measurements and criteria for their 
region-growing approach [33]. They calculated similarity measures to grow a region, and discontinuity 
measures to define the region boundary. Chang et al. proposed a region-growing method that can adaptively 
determines its threshold and merging criteria by regional feature analysis [34]. The hybrid segmentation 
methods mostly employ both region and contour constraints as a whole. One prominent class of the hybrid 
approach is made up of watershed-based methods. These methods regard the gradient image as topography 
with boundaries between regions as ridges. High-gradient areas are considered as boundaries (ridges) of 
regions, while the low-gradient areas as regions (catchments basins). It is equivalent to flooding the 
topographic basins with ridges to keep water from meeting. 
Mean shift has been proposed to produce smooth segmentation by analyzing the feature space [10]. The 
implementation of mean shift does not require many pre-specified parameters. However, the complexity of the 
algorithm makes it time-consuming. In the context of this project, mean shift can be used to automatically 
cluster the facial surface intro self-attracted blocks where we may derive feature points and characteristics of 
the each block not defined among the cephalomotric landmarks. 
The aforementioned collection of research results, however, have shown that in rare cases can one single 
category of segmentation methods be satisfactory, especially when both factors of computation and robustness 
are taken into account. Accuracy and responsiveness are crucial for biomedical imaging applications, though. 
A comprehensive survey on semi-automatic processing and analysis of CT images of the lung can be found in 
Ref. [37]. The current status of regarding research, comparison among recent efforts, research challenges, 
clinical application, and perspectives were addressed. Although focused on the CT modality and pulmonary 
systems, most advanced techniques on analyzing two- and three-dimensional medical images from 
preprocessing to qualitative/quantitative measurements to visualization were covered. The other challenges for 
analyzing biomedical images are therefore to integrate existing algorithms and to design streamlined 
procedure which is familiar to the physician to manipulate. It is not simply putting methods together or 
constructing a complex network of image processing/analysis steps for the user to choose from [29]. Gu et al. 
and Stoitsis et al. designed and implemented modular software systems to assist the physician in performing 
interactive analysis and interpretation [27,28]. These systems, however, suggested “manually” connection of

The description of the research methods used in the proposed project is as below. 
1) Improved Iterative Closest Point (ICP) 
The general problem for ICP is to align two partially overlapping meshes with minimized mismatches. 
Essential challenges for ICP are to find the correspondences, determine features, etc., such that the 
matching problem becomes to superimpose a scene shape S to with the other shape model M with best 
possible alignment. The original ICP follows the steps: (1) initialize the matching error to infinity; (2) 
calculate correspondence; (3) calculate alignment; (4) apply alignment; (5) update matching errors; (6) 
iterate until the error is acceptably low. The improved version of ICP of our work (published in Annals of 
BioMedical Engineering) is depicted as below: 
 
Our proposed improved ICP is based on the combination of the original ICP and the ICP variant with 
addition of the rigid and non-rigid information of the features. The degree of rigidity is determined by a 
trained model and the approximated features are referred to as their own degree of rigidity. The more 
deformable (or non-rigid) features are more suitable for applying the implementation of ICP variant. 
2) Compatibility of SymRG, ACM, and SymFC-RG 
We shall determine the theoretical compatibility of symmetric region grow, active contour modeling,  and 
fuzzy connectedness. Our preliminary implementations show the feasibility [42,46] given which we shall 
develop the theoretical fundations. 
 8
(b) ACM and SymRG: We employ ACM that intrinsically performs edge detection and multi-iteration to 
reach the optimal solution, followed by exploiting the characteristics of intra-region symmetric relation 
to accelerate the whole image processing procedure. The contour evolves under the influence of internal 
and external forces (Eq. 1) and is drawn towards the region boundaries. The internal forces itself is the 
contour constraint, and external forces form the gradient of edge detection, which governs contour 
towards the edge of the region of interest.

α, β, and γ are weighting parameters, these are treated to be constant on the contour. 
The running time of ACM can be improved by incorporation of symRG. Consider a digital image I 
defined on an n-dimensional discrete (digital) space ZN; i.e., IZN.  The goal of image segmentation is

1,,1,  MiRi   consists of one connected component. (In practice, the individual regions in S are 
distinguished by region labels.) Let lower-case quantities, such as a, b, p, and q, represent image points. 
An image point is called a pixel in two-dimensional (2D) images and a voxel in 3D images. Let 
upper-case quantities, such as Ri, I, S, A, and B denote sets of points in ZN. The quantity f(p) gives the 
intensity, or gray-level, value of image point p in I. If two image points a and b are connected, then at 
least one path (or ordered sequence of connected points) exists between them. Let the notation Pab 
represent such a path. Alternately, let the notation (a, p1, p2,  , pn, b) represent a particular path 
between a and b, where point a is a neighbor of point p1, p1 is a neighbor of p2, etc. For this paper, all 
points on a path must lie in the same region; i.e., if iRa , then iRp 1 , iRp 2 , , iRb . In 2D 
images, connectivity and neighbors are defined using either 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity. 
Analogously, for 3D images, 6-connectivity or 26-connectivity defines such concepts. 
xyz-separable and implies efficient segmentation can be proved.

Figure 1. Frontal and lateral Golden Ratio illustration of a face. Figure (a) depicts the facial golden ratio of the 
frontal view. The face is horizontally divided by the hair line, eye brows, and subnasle into three and a half 
rows. The centers of the centers of both pupils are used to vertically partition the face into three columns. 
Figure (b) depicts the facial golden ration of the lateral view. The head is divided into three columns by the 
vertical line extended from the exocanthion (i.e., the most lateral point of the palpebral fissure) and the 
vertical line extended from the foremost point of the earlobe. 
 
The rationale of our work is based upon Langlois and Roggman’s pioneering studies which suggested 
that composite and averaged faces promoted attractiveness [2,3]. We propose an adapted facial averaging 
model to correlate between the patient-desired and the post-surgical appearance. Local features (landmarks 
and facial patterns) are extracted, analyzed, and morphed for alignment among faces. We employ balanced 
angular and proportional analysis (BAPA) [5,6] to assess and facial attractiveness using Taiwanese female 
images. 
In this study, fifty Taiwanese female frontal facial images are employed to perform averaging process. 
We extract features from the facial images, and perform principal component analysis (PCA) to rank the 
importance of the features. Four prominent divisions – eye area, nose area, mouth area, and facial contour – 
are used to align among images. The balanced angular and proportional analysis (BAPA) is then used to 
analyze and quantify attractiveness. Twenty-eight landmarks are first extracted and labeled, followed by 
fourteen (14) proposed metrics, 10 proportional and 4 angular, are calculated. An example of an original facial 
image and its averaged facial image is illustrated in Figure 2.

Abstract 
 We present a practical and systematic method for reconstructing accurate physical models of the guinea 
pig ear. The method uses a semi-automatic technique to create three-dimensional (3-D) models of the guinea 
pig cochlea by registration of micro-computed tomography (CT) and histological images. An iterative closest 
point algorithm was employed to minimize the sum of square errors with respect to the closest histological 
model and corresponding micro-CT model. This allowed creation of an accurate geometric ear model 
including external ear canal, tympanic membrane, middle ear cavity, auditory ossicles, and the cochlea. The 
characteristic cross-sectional areas of scala tympani, scala vestibuli, and scala media were measured. The 
results confirmed that the geometric model created by this method was accurate. This method provides an 
effective way to visualize the 3-D structure and the detailed information about ear geometry required for finite 
element and multibody dynamic analysis.  
 
Keywords: ear, image reconstruction, iterative closest point algorithm, 3-D model 
 
Introduction 
 The ear transfers sound through the external ear canal (EEC) and middle ear into the cochlea. The EEC 
collects sounds and transfers them to the tympanic membrane (TM). The middle ear consists of three ossicles 
suspended in the air-filled middle ear cavity (MEC) and builds a mechanism for transmitting TM vibrations to 
the fluid in the cochlea 9. To understand this acoustic signal transmission in the ear, various theoretical models 
have been developed to analyze the function of the ear in relation to its structure 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 19, 22. Such an 
understanding could help us improve the design and function of prostheses and improve methodologies and 
planning of surgical procedures in the middle ear 16, 17, 19. These aims require the modeling of all structures of 
the hearing organ, including bones and soft-tissue structure 28. Previous studies have shown the size and shape 
of structures change along the cochlea 5, 23. These morphological changes are crucial for the discrimination of 
frequency in the organ of hearing. The mapping of these changes in the form of three-dimensional (3-D) 
models of the cochlear scalae and membranes is an important step in achieving reliable geometric data for the 
entire organ and a model of tonotopic mechanics 28. The guinea pig has become a widely used animal model 
for ear research in the past decade. Experimental data on TM vibration, middle ear ossicular movement under 
static pressure, and drugs applied to the round window membrane in the gerbil are available 27. Models of 
cochlear mechanics are therefore vital to investigate how outer hair cell forces couple to the organ of Corti 
and the basilar membrane 14.  
 Several different methods are available to investigate the structure of the cochlea. The most frequently 
used method is histological section of the cochlea with subsequent light microscopic observation and scanning 
of the slices 28. The physical sectioning technique provides the greatest detail and can visualize membrane as 
well as bone. Owing to the limited size of slices, however, the cochlea and the middle ear structure are usually 
not visualized in the same section plane. Mechanical sectioning of the ear unavoidably leads to distortion, and 
the coupling of neighboring slices is not realized in practice. It is not easy to construct the middle ear and 
cochlea model at the same time. The micro-computed tomography (CT) system for small animal imaging has 
been studied since the 1990s 10, 21, 25, 29. It can obtain high-resolution anatomical information and be combined 
with other modalities 32, 33. Micro-CT is a variation of CT and is used primarily for the imaging of bony 
structure. However, the cochlear structures (tectorial membrane, Reissner’s membrane, organ of Corti) are not 
well visualized because of the limited resolution of micro-CT, which is not capable of accurately resolving the 
membrane of the ear 22. 
 Registering two surfaces means finding a mapping between a template surface and a target surface that 
describe the position of semantically corresponding points. This can be considered as warping the template 
onto the target. Registration can be used to build a 3-D model, as introduced by Blanz and Vetter 2. This is 
 26
(b) Compute the registration vector (qk, dk) = Q(P0, Yk). 
(c) Apply the registration: PK+1 = qk(P0) 
(d) Terminate the iteration when the change in mean-square error falls below a threshold τ > 0 specifying 
the desired precision of the registration (dk – dK+1 < τ). 
Image processing and 3-D reconstruction 
 After the capture of micro-CT images and histological images, the landmarks of the temporal bone were 
identified by an otolaryngologist. Then, all of these images were transferred to an Avizo 6 visualization 
system (VSG SAS, Bordeaux, France) for 3-D reconstruction. The proposed procedure for constructing the 
ear model is shown in Fig 2, in which images from different acquisition mechanisms—micro-CT and 
histological—are employed as the input. The structures of the cochlea, ossicle, canal, membrane, and ear 
space were segmented from the micro-CT images, and the corresponding wire-framed models were 
constructed. Because of the inherent limitation of the micro-CT scanning mechanism, in which cochlear 
details exhibit characteristics similar to those of the surrounding regions, the histological images were used to 
semi-automatically identify the four chambers of the cochlea. A composite four-chamber cochlea model was 
then constructed. Both cochlea models, from micro-CT and histological images, were aligned by means of an 
ICP algorithm 1. To speed up the alignment process (and also to eliminate possible noises), the number of 
triangle faces of the wire-framed cochlea model was reduced to 5000. The value of relative root mean square 
(relative RMS) between consecutive iterations to test convergence was set to 0.0005, and the maximum 
number of iterations was 20 to guide the optimization steps. A final ear model was formed by 
affine-transforming the registered models and aligning them together.  
 In Avizo, the reconstruction model of the ear including the EEC, TM, ossicles, MEC, and cochlea from 
the micro-CT system can be easily manipulated for 3-D visualization (Fig. 3a). Segmentation of every single 
scala was required for the 3-D reconstruction of the intracochlear structures from histological images. Four 
chambers—the scala tympani, scala vestibuli, scala media, and spiral ligament—could be identified. A surface 
model of the scalae and spiral ligament from the histological images could be visualized by the surface 
generator (Fig. 3b). For the ICP algorithm to be clinically useful, the surface models of the four chambers 
were fused to construct a common cavity (Fig. 3c).  
 
Results 
 Fig. 3d demonstrates the surface model (four chambers) from the histological images fit to the surface 
model created from the micro-CT images using the ICP algorithm. The surface model created from the 
micro-CT images is shown in transparency. In Avizo, the surface model of the cochlea can be easily 
manipulated for 3-D visualization. Geometric dimensions can also be easily obtained by measuring the 
surface model. The characteristic cross-sectional areas of scala tympani, scala vestibuli, and scala media were 
measured and compared with Fernández’s result 5. The results confirmed that the geometric model created by 
this method was accurate (Fig. 4).  
 Another important application of the geometric model is structural analysis using finite element analysis 
(FEA) 30. To prepare for FEA of the ear, all surfaces of the solid model were translated into Patran (MSC 
Software, Perth, Australia) and ANSYS (ANSYS, Canonsburg, PA, USA), two commercial finite element 
modeling packages. Based on these surfaces, finite element meshes of the ear were created by means of 
automatic and manual meshing capabilities in Patran. A structured surface mesh of the cochlea derived from 
the results of this study is shown in Fig. 5a. In addition, Fig. 5b shows the complete computer-aided design 
(CAD) model including the EEC, TM, ossicles, MEC, and cochlea in the guinea pig. 
 
Discussion 
 The results of geometric modeling of the ear not only provide a foundation for understanding macro- and 
micro-mechanical processes of hearing, but also constitute an important source for the development of 
therapeutic as well as preventive methods to combat several types of inner ear disease 28. Other possible 
applications are the construction of new designs of electrodes for cochlear implants, middle ear implants, and 
a new actuator coupled to the TM and the design of strategies for pharmacological treatment of the cochlea 4, 
20, 27.  
 In morphometric study, it is important to understand measurement error. Fundamental issues in micro-CT 
scan are the resolution of the image and the resolution of the measurement device 12. Scan resolution are the 
quantifiable error for micro-CT based estimates employed in this study. Takagi and Sando 31 showed that
