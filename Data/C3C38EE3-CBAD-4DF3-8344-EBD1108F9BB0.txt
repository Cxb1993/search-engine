Therefore, reaction-sintering process can 
efficiently transform the mixture of BaCO3 and 
TiO2 into BT4 phase even the calcination stage 
is bypassed. Xu et al. reported that a mixture of 
BT4, B4T13 and BaTi2O5 (BT2) phases with 
BT4 as a major phase were observed in the 
1100oC/4 h heated BT4 precursor prepared by a 
modified Pechini method. Single phase BT4 
can be synthesized by heating the precursors at 
1200oC for 2 h. [3] Therefore, 
reaction-sintering process can efficiently 
transform the mixture of BaCO3 and TiO2 into 
BT4 phase at lower temperature than the 
modified Pechini method. 
 
 
Figure 1 XRD patterns of BaTi4O9 ceramics 
sintered at 1150-1200oC for 6 h. 
 
BT4 ceramics with density of 4.18g/cm3 and 
4.44g/cm3 (92.2% and 97.9% of theoretical 
value 4.533g/cm3) were obtained after 6 h 
sintering at 1150oC and 1170oC, respectively. 
Weng et al. proposed the relative density of 
BT4 pellets prepared by the polymeric 
precursor method increased from 91% to 95.3% 
as the sintering temperature increased from 
1200oC to 1250oC and decreased to 94% at 
1300oC. [2] While in BT4 ceramics with 
ZnO-B2O3 glass phase prepared by the 
conventional mixed oxide method, Lu and 
co-workers obtained a maximum density about 
97% of theoretical value after 1100oC/2 h 
calcining and 1250oC/ 2 h sintering. [4] Fig. 2 
shows the SEM photographs of as-fired BT4 
ceramics sintered at 1150oC and 1170oC for 6 h. 
Porous pellet with grains less than 2μm is 
observed after 1150oC sintering. The amount of 
pore decreases and the grain size increases at 
1170oC.

The shrinkage percentage of sintered BT4 
pellets sintered at 1200-1280oC for 2-6 h are 
illustrated in Fig. 3. Values between 16-17% 
are obtained. Uniform shrinkage can be 
obtained via reaction-sintering process 
although the calcination stage is bypassed. The 
influence of sintering temperature and soak 
time on the density of BT4 ceramics is shown 
in Fig. 4. High sintered density 98.2-99.5% of 
theoretical value 4.533g/cm3 can be obtained 
B2T9 are detected in the patterns. Therefore, 
reaction-sintering process can efficiently 
transform the mixture of BaCO3 and TiO2 into 
B2T9 phase. Some minor phases BT4 and 
B4T13 with same reflections of JCPDS # 
77-1567 (indicated by “1”) and JCPDS # 
84-2213 (indicated by “4”) are also detected in 
the sintered B2T9 pellets. BT4 phase was often 
observed in forming B2T9 by the solid–state 
reaction. Fang et al. reported that BT4 phase 
appeared in the calcined mixture of BaCO3 and 
TiO2 at temperatures between 900-1200oC. 
B2T9 phase appeared after 3 h calcined at 
1200oC but could not be completely formed 
even after calcined for 12 h [5]. Huang et al. 
found BT4 is the major phase in the calcined 
mixture of BaCO3 and TiO2 at 1150oC. B2T9 
phase appeared at 1200oC and completely 
formed after calcined at 1250oC for 3 h [6].  
While in the investigation of Yang et al., BT5 
and TiO2 minor phases were formed along with 
BT4 major phase in the calcined mixture of 
BaCO3 and TiO2 at 1150-1200oC for 2 h. B2T9 
phase completely formed after calcined at 
1200oC for 70 h [7]. In chemical processes such 
as sol-gel, precipitate and inverse 
micro-emulsion, BT5 phase was preferentially 
formed at calcining stage especially at lower 
temperatures [8-10]. In Fig. 7, reflections in 
JCDP # 35-0805 for BT5 phase were not 
detected but minor B4T13 phase was formed 
instead. This secondary phase was also 
observed in some studies of other researchers 
[8, 11]. 
 
 
Figure 8 Shrinkage percentages of B2T9 
ceramics sintered at various temperatures and 
soak times. 
 
The shrinkage percentage of sintered B2T9 
pellets sintered at 1280-1350oC for 2-6 h are 
illustrated in Fig. 8. Values between 16-17% 
are obtained. This indicates uniform shrinkage 
can be obtained via the reaction-sintering 
process although the calcination stage is 
bypassed. In our other investigation, 
22.7-23.7% shrinkage percentage values were 
obtained in BaTiO3 (BT) sintered at 1400oC by 
a reaction-sintering process. More CO2 is 
decomposed from BaCO3 and lost during the 
heating treatment since 50mol% BaCO3 is 
contained in BT. While in B2T9, there is only 
18.2mol% BaCO3 contained. 
 
 
Figure 9 Density of B2T9 ceramics sintered at 
various temperatures and soak times. 
 
The influence of sintering temperature and soak 
time on the density of B2T9 ceramics is shown 
in Fig. 9. High sintered density (>99.4% T.D. 
4.577 g/cm3) can be obtained for pellets 
sintered at 1280-1330oC. This is higher than the 
density values of B2T9 ceramics in other 
investigations with a calcination stage involved. 
Huang et al. obtained a highest density 4.42 
g/cm3 (96.6% T.D.) after 1200oC/3 h calcined 
and 1380oC/3 h sintered [6]. Yang and 
co-workers obtained a highest density 4.495 
g/cm3 (98.2% T.D.) after 1200oC/10 h calcined 
and 1380oC/4 h sintered [7]. A density about 
99% T.D. was obtained by Fang et al. after 
1200oC/3 h calcined and sintered at 1390oC 
without holding [5]. Wang et al. obtained a 
highest density 4.55 g/cm3 (99.4% T.D.) in 
B2T9 ceramics with 4 wt% ZrO2 added after 
1300oC/4 h sintered [12]. As in B2T9 ceramics 
synthesized by inverse micro-emulsion process, 
Lin and co-workers reported a highest density 
<96% T.D. after 900oC/4 h calcined and 1300 
oC/4 h sintered [10]. They also reported a 
highest density <97% T.D. was obtained by 
co-precipitation process after 1300-1350oC/4 h 
sintered [13]. Therefore, reaction-sintering 
process in this study is a simple and effective

Figure 13 XRD patterns of BT4 ceramics 
doped with 0.1wt% MnO2 and 0.5wt% CuO. 
 
 
 
Figure 14 SEM photos of BT4 ceramics doped 
with 0.1wt% MnO2 and sintered at (A) 1150oC, 
(B) 1200oC, (C) 1250oC and (D) 1300oC for 4 
h. 
The XRD patterns of sintered BT4 doped with 
0.1wt% MnO2 (BT4M) and 0.5wt% CuO 
(BT4C) are shown in Fig. 13. It can be seen 
that all the reflections match with those of BT4 
phase in ICDD PDF # 340070. SEM photos of 
BT4M ceramics sintered at 1150-1300oC for 4 
h are illustrated in Fig. 14. 1150oC is not high 
enough for the densification and pores can be 
easily found. Dense pellets could be obtained 
at sintering temperatures above 1200oC. At 
1250 and 1300oC, rod grains were formed. 
This is the same as in BT4 ceramics prepared 
by the reaction-sintering process. [16] 
 
 
Figure 15 Influence of sintering temperature 
and soak time on the density of BT4 ceramic 
doped with 0.1wt% MnO2 and 0.5wt% CuO. 
 
Influence of sintering temperature and soak 
time on the density of BT4M and BT4C 
ceramics is shown in Fig. 15. Density saturated 
at temperatures above 1200oC and 1050oC in 
BT4M and BT4C, respectively. High sintered 
density >98% of theoretical value 4.55g/cm3 
could be obtained. This proves highly dense 
BT4M and BT4C ceramics can be prepared by 
reaction-sintering process easily even without 
the calcining stage. In our previous study, a 
maximum density 4.45g/cm3 was found in BT4 
ceramics sintered at 1200oC. [16] Also from 
Fig. 15, CuO addition is more effective in 
lowering the sintering temperature of BT4 
ceramics. Lu and co-workers obtained a 
maximum density about 97% of theoretical 
value in BT4 ceramics with ZnO-B2O3 glass 
 6
above 1250oC and the morphology of grains is 
similar to B2T9 ceramics prepared by the 
reaction-sintering process.  
 
 
Figure 18  SEM photos of B2T9 ceramics 
doped with 0.2wt% ZrO2 and sintered at (A) 
1200oC, (B) 1250oC, (C) 1300oC and (D) 
1350oC for 4 h. 
 
The influence of sintering temperature and 
soak time on the density of B2T9Z and B2T9C 
ceramics is shown in Fig. 19. Density saturated 
at temperatures above 1300oC and 1150oC in 
B2T9Z and B2T9C, respectively. High sintered 
density >98% of theoretical value 4.577g/cm3 
could be obtained in B2T9Z and a maximum 
4.56 g/cm3 appeared at 1300oC. Lower density 
is observed in B2T9C. Also from Fig. 19, CuO 
addition is more effective in lowering the 
sintering temperature of B2T9 ceramics. 
Huang et al. obtained a maximum density 4.42 
g/cm3 after 1200oC/3 h calcined and 1380oC/3 
h sintered. [6] Yang and co-workers obtained a 
highest density 4.495g/cm3 after 1200oC/10 h 
calcining and 1380oC/4 h sintering. [7] Wang 
et al. obtained a density 4.55g/cm3 in B2T9 
ceramics with 4 wt% ZrO2 added after 
1300oC/4 h sintered. [12] Therefore, 
reaction-sintering process is a simple and 
effective method to produce highly dense 
B2T9 ceramics.
