Abstract 
  To minimize the probability of bacteria caused infections and to enhance osteointergration 
between bone and implants, vancomycin-CaP composite coating on post bioceramics coated 
titanium was carried out in this study. The vancomycin-CaP composite coated specimens were 
characterized by XRD for the crystal structures, FESEM analysis for the morphology and the 
composition, FTIR for the qualitative analysis, UV/Vis analysis for the loading and releasing of 
vancomycin, and cell culture test for the bioactivity. The cell proliferation, differentiation, and 
mineralization were evaluated by methyl thiazole tetrazolium (MTT) and alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), respectively. The average content of vancomycin on the composite coating is 46.4 μg/cm2, 
and the release of vancomycin will reach over 90%, higher than the minimum bactericidal 
concentration (MBC) but less than the minimum toxicity concentration (MTC), in the in vitro 
release test with 3 ml PBS solution for 24 hours. The results of cell culture tests also indicated 
that this coating, containing antibiotic vancomycin, is not harmful to the bioactivity of 
osteoblast-like cell, such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization.

Materials and methods 
1. Electrolytic deposition of Vancomycin/CaP composite 
  Post HA/TiO2 coated titanium specimens were further deposited in Van-CaP solution, a mixed 
solution composed of 0.042 M Ca(NO3)2．4H2O, 0.025 M NH4H2PO4, and vancomycin 10 mg/ml, 
at a cathodic current density of 1 mA/cm2 for 1000 s using an EG&G M273A Potentiostat and 
Power Suit software. The titanium disc was the cathode, platinum the anode, and saturated 
AgCl/Ag the reference electrode. The coated specimens were then naturally dried and stored in 
the refrigerator at 4℃. To study the mechanism of vancomycin-CaP composite deposition, the 
dynamic polarization tests in DI (deionized) water, vancomycin 10 mg/ml solution, and Van-CaP 
solution were also carried out. However, characterization of the coating was analyzed by X-ray 
diffraction, measurement of the coating weight and Fourier Transformation Infrared analysis 
(FTIR) and Field emission SEM (JSM-6700F, JEOL) 
2. In vitro release of vancomycin 
The release of vancomycin was carried out by placing one vancomycin/CaP coated disc in a 
plastic container containing 3 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, SIGMA). After 30 min, 1, 3, 
5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 24 h, the PBS solution was collected and refreshed. The vancomycin 
concentration in PBS was measured by UV/VIS spectrometer (U-3010, HITACHI) at 280 nm【9】. 
3. Cell culture 
Human osteoblast-like cell line G-292 (ATCC CRL-1423) 【18】 was originally isolated from 
a human osteosarcoma. Cells were initially cultured in McCoy’s 5a medium containing 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 μg/ml of strepotmycin. The cells were 
then thawed and cultured in T75 flasks and incubated at 37 ℃ in a humidified atmosphere with 
5% CO2. Media were changed every 3 days. At confluence, cells were detached by trypsin 
treatment. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in McCoy’s 5a medium containing 10% 
FBS. Finally, cells were seeded onto the PS (polystyrene), HA/TiO2 coated and vancomycin/CaP 
coated specimens in a 24-well plate at a density of 5×104 cells/well. After 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 
days of incubation, the cells adhesion morphology was examined by scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM). The cell proliferation, differentiation, and mineralization were evaluated by 
methyl thiazole tetrazolium (MTT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay, respectively. 
Results and discussion 
1. Deposition mechanism 
The cathodic polarization curves of titanium substrate at room temperature in the DI water, 
vancomycin 10 mg/ml in DI water, and vancomycin 10 mg/ml in CaP solutions are shown in Fig. 
1 The polarization curve in vancomycin solution can be divided into three regions. Reaction (1) 
in region Ⅰ (0.1 V ~ -0.35 V) revealed higher limiting current density due to higher O2 
concentration. In region Ⅱ (-0.35 V ~ -0.75 V), pH (3.52) in vancomycin solution was less than 
that in Van-CaP solution (3.87) resulting in reaction (2) easily observed.

3. Morphology 
The FESEM observation of Van-CaP and HA/TiO2 coated titanium specimens are shown in 
Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Because of vancomycin with HCl, the pH value changed from 4.26 to 
3.87 by adding 10 mg/ml vancomycin into the electrolytic solution. Caused by the difference of 
deposition temperature and pH value, the morphology of the Van-CaP coating was coral like 
shapes. The morphology of HA/TiO2 coating was full of narrow plates, revealing loose structure.

4. In vitro drug release 
This composite coating totally contained 71.5±8.1 μg on 1.54 cm2 specimen. As a result, the 
average content of vancomycin on the Van-CaP composite coating was 46.43±5.26 μg/cm2. The 
in vitro release during 24 hours in 3 ml PBS is shown in Fig. 8. Van-CaP coatings had initial burst 
in 30 minutes about 23% of the total content. That is equivalent to 5.5 ppm in the PBS solution 
which was higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1 ppm 【8】. In 60 minutes, 
the concentration of vancomycin reached 11.5 ppm in the PBS solution which was higher than 
the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) 8 ppm 【8】. The average concentration after 1 
day releasing reached 23.8 ppm which was still less than the minimum toxicity concentration 
(MTC) 50 ppm 【19】. All specimens released more than 90% of the total content of vancomycin 
in 24 hours.

5. Cell culture 
The MTT activity of the osteoblast-like cell (G-292) after 1, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 19 days incubation 
on PS, HA, and Van-CaP specimens are shown in Fig. 9. The MTT activity increased with the 
incubation time for all specimens, which indicated that the proliferation proceeded on all 
specimens. The proliferation on the tree samples can be decided by deducting the previous value 
of the MTT activity. According to the proliferation, no side effect was observed on the composite 
coating. Therefore, the dropping of the PS on proliferation was caused by filling of the culture 
well, but on HA and Van-CaP was caused by differentiation. 
  The ALP activity of the osteoblast-like cell (G-292) after 5, 7, 10, and 14 days incubation on 
PS, HA, and Van-CaP specimens are shown in Fig. 28. The values dropping at 14 days showed 
the completion of differentiation cycle on the HA and Van-CaP coated specimens【20, 21】. On the
