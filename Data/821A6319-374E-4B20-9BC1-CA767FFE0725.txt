Abstract 
This project adopted Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN) to recognize Mandarin digit 
speech. The nonspecific speaker speech 
recognition was the target of this project. 
Genetic algorithm (GA) was first used to 
replace Steepest Descent Method (SDM) and 
make a global search of optimal weight in 
neural network. The improved GA is then used 
to train the ANN.  We can find that the 
performance of speech recognition was 
improved by the later method. The experiment 
in this project will show that if BPNN is 
trained by GAs, higher recognition rate will be 
attained. 
 
Key words: neural network, improved genetic 
algorithm, non-specific speaker speech 
recognition 
 
1 . Introduction 
 
The development for speech recognition 
system has been for a while. The recognition 
platform can be divided into three types. 
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [9], the 
earliest platform, uses the variation in frame's 
time for adjustment and further recognition. 
Later, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 
replaced DTW. Finally, Hidden Markov 
Model was developed to adopt statistics for 
improved recognition performance. 
Besides the recognition platform, speech 
recognition also includes: recording of voice 
signal, point detect, pre-emphasis, speech 
feature capture, etc. The final step inputs 
sample feature to recognition platform for 
matching. 
In recent years, study on Genetic Algorithm 
can be found in many research papers [2], [3], 
[7]. They demonstrated different 
characteristics in Genetic Algorithm than 
others. For example, parallel search based on 
random multi-points, instead of a single point, 
was adopted to avoid being limited to local 
optimum. In the operation of Genetic 
Algorithm, it only needs to establish the 
objective function without auxiliary operations, 
such as differential operation. Therefore, it can 
be used for the objective functions for all types 
of problems.  
Because artificial neural network has better 
speech recognition speed and less calculation 
load than others, it is suitable for chips with 
lower computing capability. Therefore, 
artificial neural network was adopted in this 
study as speech recognition platform. Most 
artificial neural networks for speech 
recognition are back-propagation neural 
networks. The local optimum problem [6] with 
Steepest Descent Method makes it fail to reach 
the highest recognition rate. In this study, 
Genetic Algorithm was used to improve the 
drawback first.  Then, a modified 
evolutionary step of GA, called improved GA 
[8], is used to train the ANN.  We can see 
that the learning performance of the ANN 
trained by improved GA is better than that 
trained by a traditional GA.  
The rest of this project is organized as 
follows. In section 2, the speech 
3 Speech recognition platform 
 
BPNN is the most common way in ANN. 
Although ANN has fast recognition and fault 
tolerance, it is not perfect because its SDM has 
a problem with Local Optimum. To prevent 
this from happening, GA is adopted to assist in 
SDM for obtaining optimal weight and 
improved recognition effect.  
 
3.1 Back-propagation neural network 
 
In principle, back-propagation neural 
network uses Multiple-Layer Perception as 
system framework and Back-Propagation 
Algorithm as training rule. Such a system is 
called back-propagation neural network. 
Multiple-layer in Multiple-Layer Perception 
model indicates it is composed of many layers 
of neurons. Besides, the signal transmittance 
mode between neurons in two layers is the 
same as that for a single layer. The study 
adopted three-layer structure (input layer, 
hidden layer, output layer) as the basic 
framework for speech recognition. 
 
3.2 Improved Genetic algorithm 
 
The key point of the improved GA is that the 
chromosomes after crossover will then be 
averagely arranged in the central region and 
boundary region of the search domain.  This 
will make the next generation more potential 
to find the global optimal solution. The 
improved crossover is stated as follows.

The parameter ]1  ,0[∈w  is arbitrarily chosen. It 
can be seen that the equation (3.1) and (3.4) 
will produce two new chromosomes which is 
distributed in the central region of the search 
domain while equations (3.2) and (3.3) will 
produce two new chromosomes distributed in 
the boundary region.   
 
4 Experiment Results 
 
In the initial speech, voice files for ten 
people were collected. One file has Chinese 
numeral 1 ~ 9. Each people recorded four sets, 
three of which were used for training and one 
of which was for test.  Recording format had 
sampling frequency 8 kHz, mono channel 16 
bit sampling point. After recording, point 
detection was to remove silence segment, 
followed by pre-emphasis. Then, speech 
segment was divided to 20 fixed frames. 
Feature parameter was extracted from each 
frame. One frame had 10 features. Thus, each 
number would have 200 features. 
In the aspect of speech frame, because ANN 
recognition platform was adopted, speech 
segment needs the same number of frames 
regardless of its length of time. The adopted 
dynamic-size frame was different from the 
DTW fixed frame. The study also adopted 
dynamic sampling point (fixed overlap rate). 
The frame sampling point can be expressed by 
the following equation (4.1) [5]: 
weight.

4.2 Experiment Results with Genetic 
Algorithm to assist in Training   
Because SDM used to seek the weights of. 
back-propagation neural network tended to 
have problems with local optimum, so genetic 
algorithm was used to seek the weight for the 
entire domain [2]. 
If we use the GA with the two-point 
crossover to train ANN, the MSE for the 
output of ANN after trained is shown in Fig. 2.  
Moreover, the MSE for the output of ANN is 
depicted in Fig. 3, if it is trained by improved 
GA.

Fig. 3 MSE of output of ANN trained by improved GA. 
 
Comparing the two results observed from 
Fig.2 and Fig. 3, we can see that the learning 
performance of ANN trained by improved GA 
is better than that trained by GA (with 
two-point crossover). Moreover, from Table 1, 
it can be seen that the recognition rate up to 
95% which is better than that obtained from 
SDM training.

5 Conclusions 
Through out SDM in BPNN speech 
recognition system, attempting to recognize 
Chinese speech we have the recognition rate 
up to 91%.  While if the GA is adopted for 
the training of ANN, the recognition rate can 
be improved to 95%.  On the other hand, in 
this project, we have also shown that the 
improved GA reveals a more excellent 
learning performance that GA by the 
experiments.  However, the drawback of GA 
used to train the ANN is that it will waste 
many training time.  Consequently, other 
improved methods must be investigated in the 
future research.
