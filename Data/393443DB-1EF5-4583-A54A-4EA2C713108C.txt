Abstract 
In this study, we report the physical properties of H2PtCl6/Nafion, Pt/Nafion. Pt-C(Pt content 
40 wt%) /Nafion paste solutions and morphology of H2PtCl6/Nafion, Pt/Nafion, and 
Pt-C/Nafion thin films prepared by casting from these solutions with reduction of Pt
4+
 ions to 
Pt. The solvents are NMF (N-methyl formmamide), DMF (N,N’-dimethyl formamide), 
DMAc (N,N’-dimethyl acetamide), MeOH/water (methanol/water, 4/1 g/g), EtOH/water 
(ethanol/water, 4/1 g/g), IPA/water (2-propanol/water, 4/1 g/g). The influences of solubility 
parameters and dielectric constants of solvents on the conformations of Nafion in the catalyst 
solutions and morphology of H2PtCl6/Nafion, Pt/Nafion, Pt-C/Nafion thin films were 
investigated and discussed. The experimental results revealed that H2PtCl6/Nafion and 
Pt-C/Nafion/DMAc had better dispersion in DMAc and DMF solvents, and Pt/Nafio had a 
better dispersion in the NMF solvent. MEAs were prepared using Nafion-212 (Du Pont) PEM 
with catalyst layers prepared using H2PtCl6/Nafion-DMF, Pt/Nafion/NMF, and Pt-C/Nafion/ 
DMAc solutions. The PEMFC unit cell tests results showed that all of these MEAs had a 
current density i> 2000 mA/cm

C. Especially, the MEA with double 
catalyst layers prepared from H2PtCl6/Nafion-DMF and Pt-C/Nafion/DMFsolutions had i=

particles with PEM and gas diffusion layer (GDL; a 
carbon paper or a carbon cloth) and also conducts of 
protons generated on the surfaces of Pt catalysts, 
where the electrochemical reaction occurs. How to 
obtain a CL with small aggregation and well 
dispersion of Pt particles in CL with high 
electrochemical surface areas (ECSAs) is one of the 
important issues for CL fabrication of MEAs 
preparations. In order to obtain small aggregated and 
well dispersed Pt particles in CLs, several 
researchers [8,9] prepared Pt CLs by fabricating a 
ultra-thin H2PtCl6/Nafion solution layer either on the 
PEM or on the GDL. After evaporating solvents, the 
Pt
4+
 ion in the ultra-thin Nafion layer was reduced to 
Pt particles. It is obvious that the solvent of a 
H2PtCl6/Nafion solution is an important factor 
controlling sizes and dispersion of the reduced Pt 
particles in an ultra-thin CL layer. The main objective 
of this work is to study the influence of solvents on: 
(1) the conformations of Pt
4+
/Nafion complexes in 
dilute H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions; (2) the morphology 
of the reduced Pt/Nafion films prepared by casting 
from H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions; (3) the sizes of Pt 
particles of the reduced Pt/Nafion thin films prepared 
by casting from H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions. We 
showed the distribution and sizes of Pt catalyst 
particles in a reduced Pt/Nafion thin film prepared by 
casting from H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions could be 
controlled by varying the solvent of the solution.  
The second subject of present study is to 
investigate the solution properties of Pt/Nafion 
solutions with various solvents and Pt ECSAs of the 
films prepared by solutions casting from the 
solutions. And, the third subject is to the solution 
properties of Pt-C/Nafion solutions with various 
solvents and Pt ECSAs of the films prepared by 
solutions casting from the solutions. 
Finally two types of membrane electrode 
assemblies (MEAs), i.e. conventional 5-layer MEA 
and 7-layer MEA, were prepared with CLs fabricated 
using the optimum H2PtCl6/Nafion, Pt/Nafion, and 
Pt-C/Nafion solutions. The PEMFC unit fuel cell 
tests of these MEAs were carried out to evaluate the 
influence of solvents of the catalyst ink solutions for 
CLs fabrication on the the fuel cells performance.  
The solvents used in this study for preparing 
H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions are: N,N’-dimethyl 
acetamide (DMAc), N,N’-dimethyl formamid (DMF), 
N-methyl formamide (NMF), methanol-water 
(MeOH-H2O, 4/1 g/g) mixture solvent, ethanol-water 
(EtOH-H2O, 4/1 g/g) mixture solvent, and 
isopropanol-water (IPA- H2O, 4/1 g/g) mixture 
solvent. The  and  values of these solvents [10,11] 
and the dual s of Nafion [3] are summarized in 
Table 1. In Table 1, the  and  of MeOH-H2O, 
EtOH- H2O, and IPA- H2O mixture solvents were 
calculated from the  and  data of pure alcohols and 
water using theoretical equations described refs 11 
and 12.

 The solid Nafion resin prepared as described in 
sec. 2.1 was dissolved separately in DMAc, DMF,

carbon film (CF400-Cu, Electron Microscopy 
Sciences, Inc., PA) was floated on the top of the 
surface of a drop of 0.6 mg/ml Nafion solution for 12 
hr. Thus a thin film of Nafion solution was covered 
on the surface of the copper grid. The copper grid 
with a thin film of a Nafion solution was frozen 
immediately in a liquid nitrogen container at a 
temperature of ~ -190
o

frozen Nafion thin film on the copper grid surface 
was dried under vacuum at -130

copper grid with a dried Nafion film on its surface 
was then immersed in 0.5 M Pb(NO3)2 (Aldrich

dilute solutions 
Several studies have been devoted to the 
properties of Nafion solutions [14-22]. Because the 
solvents of the commercial Nafion solutions (i.e. Du 
Pont Nafion solutions) are usually mixtures of water, 
methanol, isopropanol, and unspecified mixed ether, 
most of studies concentrated on structures of Nafion 
molecules in dilute water and aliphatic alcohols 
solutions. The experimental results revealed that 
Nafion perfluorocarbon backbones aggregated and 
formed compact cylinders in water and aliphatic 
alcohols solutions with sulfonated vinyl ether side 
chains surrounding on the surfaces of the aggregate 
cylinders and the sulfonated vinyl ether side chains 
were in contact with solvents [17,18,22]. The 
conformations of Nafion molecules in dilute solutions 
with various solvents (i.e. DMAc, DMF, NMF, and 
alcohol-H2O mixture solvents) were first freeze dried 
on copper grids at 190
o
C and investigated using TEM 
in a previous work [12]. In order to compare 
conformations of Nafion molecules with those of 
H2PtCl4/Nafion complexes in dilute solutions (Fig. 2, 
TEM micrographs), in this section we show TEM 
micrographs of freeze dried dilute Nafion solutions 
with a same magnified scale as those will be shown 
in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 1 illustrates the TEM micrographs (x10
5
) 
of Nafion molecular conformations of 0.6 mg/ml 
Nafion in DMAc, DMF, NMF, MeOH-H2O, 
EtOH-H2O, and IPA-H2O solutions freeze dried on 
copper grids. The TEM micrographs showed that 
Nafion molecules have sphere-like structures in DMF 
and DMAc solvents (Fig. 1-a), mixture of thin 
rod-like and rectangle-like structures in NMF(Fig. 
1-b), mixture of rectangle-like (or thick rod-like) and 
cube-like structures in MeOH-H2O, EtOH-H2O, and 
IPA-H2O solvents (Fig. 1-c). 
 The various conformations of Nafion molecules 
in different solvents were attributed to different  and 
 of solvents. The dual s of Nafion are  
(cal/cm
3
)
1/2
 (relating to perfluorocarbon backbone) 
and 17.3 (cal/cm
3
)
1/2
 (relating to vinyl ether 
sulfonic acid side chains). From Table 1, we know 
that  (cal/cm3)1/2 of DMAc and  
(cal/cm
3
)
1/2
 of DMF are close to the  of Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones and far from the  of 
Nafion vinylether sulfonic acid side chains. The 
solvents DMAC and DMF are more compatible with 
perfluorocarbon backbones and less compatible with 
vinyl ether side chains of Nafion. Thus few 
perfluorocarbon backbones of Nafion molecules 
aggregate in DMAc and DMF solvents. Nafion 
molecules form single chain coiled structures in 
dilute DMAc and DMF solutions (Fig. 1-a). The 
vinyl ether sulfonic acid side chains are buried inside 
the coils and the perfluorocarbon backbones are on 
the surfaces of coils and in contact with solvents of 
Nafion. Table 1 shows NMF has  (cal/cm3)1/2 
and = 182.4. The  of NMF is close to the  of 
vinylether side chains and far from the  of Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones. NMF is compatible with 
vinylether side chains and less compatible with 
perfluorocarbon backbones. Thus Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones may aggregate in NMF 
with the vinylether side chains surrounding on the 
surfaces of aggregation particles and in contact with 
NMF solvent. Also the high of NMF causes high 
dissociations of sulfonic acid groups and formation of 
highly negative charges on side chain sulfonic acid 
groups. The electrostatic charge repulsions among the 
highly negative charged side chains cause Nafion 
molecules to form rod-structures (Fig. 1-b).  
The  of MeOH-H2O is close to the  of vinyl 
ether sulfonic acid side chains and far from the  of 
perfluorocarbon backbones of Nafion. Thus 
MeOH-H2O solvent is more compatible with 
vinylether sulfonic acid side chains and less 
compatible with perfluorocarbon backbones. Nafion 
backbones aggregate in MeOH-H2O with vinyl ether 
side chains surrounding on the surfaces of particles 
and in contact with solvent. The high= 40.3 of 
MeOH-H2O results in the formation of negative 
charges on Nafion molecules. The electrostatic 
charge repulsions among the negative charged side 
chains caused formation of anisomeric rod-shape 
conformations. The TEM micrographs showed 
Nafion forming rectangle-like (or thick rod-like) and 
cube-like structures in dilute MeOH-H2O solutions 
(Fig. 1-c). These results were simialr to the ESR 
study reported by Szadzinska-Pietek [17,18]. The  of 
MeOH-H2O is lower than that of NMF. The 
inter-polymer electrostatic charge repulsions among 
the Nafion molecules in MeOH-H2O solvent are 
lower than in NMF. Comparing with Nafion/NMF 
solutions, in which Nafion molecules form rod-like 
structures, more Nafion backbones aggregate in 
MeOH-water than in NMF and form rectangle-like 
and cube-like structures. EtOH-H2O and IPA-H2O 
solvents have similar properties to MeOH-H2O 
solvent. But comparing with MeOH-H2O, the s of 
EtOH-H2O and IPA-H2O are lower and closer to  of 
Nafion perfluorocarbon backbones. Thus Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones are more compatible with 
EtOH-H2O and IPA-H2O than with MeOH-H2O. 
Thus the degrees of Nafion perfluorocarbon 
backbones aggregations in EtOH-H2O and IPA-H2O 
are lower than in MeOH- H2O. We also found the 
shapes of Nafion aggregated particles were thin and 
behaved as rod-like and rectangle-like structures in 
EtOH-H2O and were thick and behaved as 
rectangle-like and cube-like structures in IPA-H2O 
[12].

caused further aggregations of Nafion molecules in 
solutions.  
As described in sec. 3.1, Nafion backbones 
aggregate in alcohol-H2O solutions, with vinyl ether 
side chains surrounding on the surfaces of particles 
and in contact with solvents (Figs. 1-d ~ 1-f). The 
mixing of H2PtCl4 into the Nafion/ alcohol-water 
solutions causes electro-static charge shielding of the 
side chain –SO3- groups by Pt4+ ions. Since Nafion 
backbones aggregate in alcohol-H2O solutions with 
vinyl ether side chains surrounding on the surfaces of 
the aggregate particles and contacting with solvents, 
most of positive Pt
4+
 ions might locate near the 
negative side chain –SO3- groups and were on the 
surfaces of Nafion aggregated particles. The 
electro-static shielding of the negatively 
charged –SO3- groups of Nafion results in the 
reduction of inter-polymer charge repulsion, leading 
the H2PtCl4/Nafion complexes particles to be less 
rigid than the pure Nafion molecules in alcohol/water 
solutions without mixing H2PtCl4. Thus the 
H2PtCl4/Nafion complexes particles had oblate or 
sphere-like structures rather than rod-like structures 
as Nafion molecules in alcohol-H2O solutions. The 
electro-static shielding of negative charges –SO3
-
 
groups by Pt
4+
 ions also caused the reduction of 
inter-polymer electro-static charge repulsion and led 
H2PtCl4/Nafion complex have to larger aggregations 
than pure Nafion molecules in alcohol-H2O solutions. 
Thus the sizes of Nafion/H2PtCl4 complexes in 
alcohol-H2O solutions are larger than those of pure 
Nafion molecules in alcohol-H2O solutions.  
 In sec 3.1, we also show that Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones are not compatible with 
NMF solvent and aggregate in NMF solvent to form 
rod-like structures. Owing to the much higher  of 
NMF than alcohol-H2O mixture solvents, the 
electrostatic charge repulsion among Nafion 
molecules in NMF is much larger than in 
alcohol-H2O mixture solvents. Thus the degree of 
perfluorocarbon backbone aggregations in NMF is 
lower than in alcohol-H2O mixture solvents (Fig. 1-c 
and Figs. 1-d ~ 1-f). However, when H2PtCl4 was 
mixed into the solution, the presence of Pt
4+
 ions 
caused an electro-static shielding of the negatively 
charged Nafion side chain –SO3- groups. The 
electro-static shielding of the side chain –SO3- groups 
reduced both intra- and inter- polymer electro-static 
charge repulsions, leading to the shrikage of polymer 
chains and the aggregation of polymer chains. Thus 
the sizes of H2PtCl4/Nafion complexes are oblate and 
larger than pure Nafion particles in NMF solutions 
(Fig. 1-c and Fig. 2-c).  
 The changes of Nafion molecular 
conformations by the introducing of Pt
4+
 ions in the 
dilute solutions are summarized in Fig. 3. Fig. 3-a 
shows the coiled structures of Nafion molecules 
without aggregations in DMAc and DMF solvents, 
which have  closing to 1 of Nafion perfluorocarbon 
backbone. The side chain -SO3
-
 groups are buried 
inside the coils with perfluorocarbon backbones 
locating on the surfaces of the coils and in contact 
with solvents. The Fig. 3-b carton shows the 
conformations of H2PtCl4/Nafion complexes in dilute 
DMAc and DMF solutions. The Pt
4+
 ions are in 
contact with the Nafion side chain -SO3
-
 groups and 
buried inside the coiled structures. These two cartons 
show no significant change of Nafion molecular 
conformation before and after mixing H2PtCl4 into 
Nafion/DMAc and Nafion/DMF dilute solutions. Fig. 
3-c shows the aggregated rod-like structures of 
Nafion molecules in dilute NMF and alcohol-H2O 
solutions, which have  closing to 2 of Nafion vinyl 
ether sulfonic acid side chains. The Nafion 
perfluorocarbon backbones are not compatible with 
solvents and form aggregate particles with side chain 
-SO3
-
 groups, which are compatible with solvents, 
locating surrounding the surfaces of the aggregate 
particles and in contact with solvents and easy to 
dissociate to form negatively charged -SO3
-
 groups. 
The intra-particle electrostatic charge repulsions 
among the negatively charged -SO3
-
 groups results in 
the formation of rod-like aggregate structures. Fig. 
3-d shows the conformation of H2PtCl4/Nafion 
complexes in dilute NMF and alcohol-H2O solutions. 
The presence of Pt
4+
 ions in the solutions caused an 
electro-static shielding of the negatively 
charged –SO3- groups, leading to the reduction of 
both intra- and inter- polymer electro-static charge 
repulsions, and thus the shrinkage of polymer chains 
and further aggregation of polymer aggregate 
particles. The sizes of H2PtCl4/Nafion complexes are 
oblate and larger than pure Nafion particles in 
alcohol-H2O and NMF solutions.

○ Cl- ion (green color). The shape of particles in 
dilute solutions (Fig. 5-a) after freeze dried at -190
o
C 
was similar to the TEM micrographs shown in Figs. 
2-c ~ 2-f. The shapes of Pt particles agglomerations 
in Nafion thin films after evaporating solvents (Fig. 
4-b) are similar to the TEM micrographs shown in 
Figs. 6-c ~ 6-f. 
 
 
Figs. 6-a ~ 6-f are the TEM micrographs of 
reduced Pt/Nafion films prepared by casting from 
dilute H2PtCl6/Nafion in DMAc, DMF, NMF, 
MeOH-H2O, EtOH-H2O, and IPA-H2O solutions, 
respectively. Two magnified scales TEM micrographs 
were shown in Figs. 6-a ~ 6-f. The figure numbers 
designated as “1” in last digit such as Fig. 6-a-1, 
6-b-1… etc had a TEM magnified scale of 2x105, and 
those designated as “2” in last digit such as Fig. 6-a-2, 
6-b-2… etc had a TEM magnified scale of 2x104. The 
micrographs with a larger magnified scale (i.e. 2x10
5
) 
were easy to observe the sizes of Pt aggregate 
particles, while the micrographs with a smaller 
magnified scale (i.e. 2x10
4
) were easy to investigate 
the distribution of Pt aggregate particles. As 
described in sec. 2.3, the solvents were evaporated at 
50
o
C for 30 h and then under vacuum at 80
o
C for 1 h. 
After that, the Pt
4+
 ions were reduced using H2/Ar 
gas at 110
o
C for 2 h. Thus the morphologies of 
H2PtCl6/Nafion membranes after reducing Pt
4+
 to Pt 
were similar to those before Pt
4+
 was reduced. It is 
should be mentioned here, that the TEM micrographs 
of Fig. 2 demonstrate the “Pt4+-Nafion complex 
particles” in the dilute solutions. The black particles 
shown in Fig. 2 include Nafion molecules and the 
reduced Pt particles associating with –SO3- groups of 
Nafion (the cartons shown in Fig. 4-a and Fig. 5-a). 
The gray-bright region in Fig. 2 is the carbon film of 
the copper grid. However, the black particles shown 
in the TEM micrographs of Fig. 6 demonstrate “Pt 
agglomerated particles”, which are dispersed in 
Nafion membranes. In Fig. 6, the gray-bright region 
is Nafion and the dark region is Pt agglomerated 
particles. Since the TEM samples of Fig. 2 were 
prepared by freeze drying directly from films of 
dilute H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions, thus the 
H2PtCl6/Nafion complex particles on the carbon thin 
films of the TEM copper grids after reducing Pt
4+
 to 
Pt had conformations similar to the conformations of 
H2PtCl6/Nafion complexes swollen with solvents. 
When comparing the particles sizes of TEM 
micrographs of Fig. 6 with Fig. 2, one will find the 
sizes of the Pt aggregated particles in Nafion 
membranes (Fig. 6) were smaller than the those of 
H2PtCl6/Nafion complex particles swollen with 
solvents (Fig. 2).

3.5. Viscosities studies of Nafion, Pt/Nafion and 
Pt-C/Nafion solutions 
Fig. 8 is the dynamic shear viscosities data of 
dilute Nafion solutions. These data show the zero 
shear viscosities ((→ 0)) of the solutions are 
solvent dependent and decreases according to the 
solvents in the sequence of: IPA-H2O> EtOH-H2O> 
NMF> DMAc ~ DMF ~ MeOH-H2O. These 
solutions reveal a Newtonian flow liquid as shear 
frequency < 5 rad/sec. As > 5 rad/sec, the 
viscosities of Nafion/EtOH-H2O, Nafion/DMAc, 
Nafion/DMF, and Nafion/MeOH-H2O solutions 
increase and then decreases with increasing shear 
frequency, indicating shear thickening solutions. 
However, the Nafion/IPA-H2O and Nafion/NMF 
solutions reveal shear thinning solutions, i.e. 
solutions viscosities decrease with increasing .  
 Since some of the Pt
4+
 ions were reduced to Pt 
particles when H2PtCl6 was mixed into Nafion 
solutions, especially in Nafion/MeOH-H2O and 
Nafion/EtOH-H2O solutions. The dynamic shear 
viscosity data of H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions 
measurements were not performed in the present 
work. 
 Figs. 9-a and 9-b show dynamic shear viscosity 
data of Pt/Nafion solutions with [Pt]/[Nafion] wt 
ratios of 1/1 and 2/1 g/g, respectively. Because of 
precipitation of Pt/Nafion aggregates, the dynamic 
shear viscosities data of Pt-Nafion/MeOH-H2O and 
Pt-Nafion/IPA solutions were not obtained. 
Comparing the data of Fig. 9 with those of Fig. 8, we 
found mixing Pt-black particles into Nafion solutions 
resulted in a reduction of (→0). The presence of 
Pt particles in Nafion dilute solutions caused 
intra-polymer –SO3-···Pt-···3-OS– interatcions, 
leading to shrinkage of polymer chains and reduction 
of polymer solutions viscosities. 
 Figs 8 and 9 also show unusual behavior of 
Nafion/NMF and Pt-Nafion/NMF solutions. The 
Nafion/NMF solution revealed shear thinning 
behavior. However, the Pt-Nafion/NMF solution 
revealed Newtonian behavior at < 5 rad/sec, shear 
thinning at 5 rad/sec << 30 rad/sec, shear 
thickening at 30 rad/sec << 200 rad/sec, and shear

3.6. Dispersion and stabilities of Pt and Pt-C 
particles in Nafion solutions 
 
 Usually the membrane electrode assemblies 
(MEAs) are prepared by coating a thin film of a 
catalyst/Nafion solution either on gas diffusion layers 
(CCG method) or polyeletrolyte membranes (CCM 
method) and then the solvents are evaporated from 
the thin films. Thus the dispersion and stability of 
catalysts in Nafion solutions are important factors for 
MEA catalyst layer (CL) fabrication. Fig. 11 shows 
the stability test of Pt/Nafion solutions in tubes, in 
which the wt ration of Pt/Nafion was 1/1 g/g and 
Nafion concentration was 1.0 mg/ml. It is obvious 
that precipitates of Pt/Nafion/alcohol solutions were 
observed after the solutions were mixed fro 30 min 
and the Pt particles in Nafion/DMAc, Nafion/DMF, 
and Nafion/NMF solutions were more stable than in 
Nafion/alcohol solutions. However, the Pt-C particles 
were well dispersed and stable in all the Nafion 
solutions as shown in Fig. 12. One of the main 
differences between Pt-black and Pt-C particles is the 
sizes of the particles. The size of Pt-black particles is 
around 5-10 nm (Table 2, XRD data) which is smaller 
than that of a Nafion molecule in dilute solutions 
(Table 3, static light scattering RG (radius of gyration) 
data). However, the size of Pt-C particles is around 
50-100 nm which is slightly larger than or equal to 
those of Nafion molecules in dilute solutions. In 
Pt-Nafion solutions, the each Nafion molecule may 
interact with many small Pt-black particles and forms 
large aggregate particles and precipitate when the 
solvents (i.e. alcohol-H2O solvents) are not well 
compatible with Nafion.

3.7. SEM morphology studies of Pt/Nafion and 
Pt-C/Nafion thin films sprayed coating on carbon 
papers 
 The Pt/Nafion and Pt-C/Nafion ink solutions 
consisting of various solvents were prepared and 
sprayed coating on SGL 35BC carbon papers. The 
morphology of the surfaces of Pt/Nafion and 
Pt-C/Nafion thin films on carbon paper was observed 
using SEM. Figs. 13-15 are the SEM micrographs of 
Pt/Nafion thin films sprayed coating using DMAc,

3.8. CV studies of Pt ECSA of thin films prepared 
from H2PtCl6/Nafion, Pt/Nafion, and Pt-C/Nafion 
solutions 
3.8.1. Pt ECSA of thin films prepared from 
H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions 
The Pt/Nafion electrodes prepared by spray 
coating H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions containing various 
solvents on carbon papers and then reducing Pt
4+
 to 
Pt were used for CV measurements. The CV 
voltammograms of H2 adsorption/desorption on Pt 
catalysts of Pt/Nafion electrodes in 0.5 M sulfuric 
acid aqueous solution measured at room temperature 
are shown in Fig. 22. The H2 adsorption peak area 
was used for Pt ECSA evaluation. The estimated Pt 
ECSA data of electrodes prepared from various 
H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions with a Pt loading of 0.1 
mg/cm
2
 are summarized in Table 4. These results 
suggested the ECSAs of Pt/Nafion electrodes 
prepared from H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions decreased 
accoding to the solvents of H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions 
in sequence of: DMAc> DMF> NMF> IPA-H2O> 
MeOH-H2O ~ EtOH-H2O. These results were not 
quite consistent with the XRD Pt particles sizes 
shown in Table 2, which  increased according to the 
solvents for preparing Pt/Nafion films as: NMF< 
IPA-H2O < EtOH-H2O< MeOH-H2O< DMF< DMAc. 
The Pt ECSA of Pt particles in the electrodes is the 
combination results of sizes and dispersion of Pt 
particles. The electrodes with smaller Pt particles 
sizes and better Pt particles dispersion should have 
higher Pt ECSA. Our experimental results showed 
though the Pt particles sizes of Pt/Nafion electrodes 
prepared from H2PtCl6/Nafion/ DMAc and 
H2PtCl6/Nafion/ DMF solutions were larger than 
those prepared from H2PtCl6/Nafion/alcohol-H2O 
solutions (Table 2), the well disperson and less 
aggregation of Pt particles (Fig. 6 TEM micrographs) 
in the electrodes caused the electrodes prepared from 
H2PtCl6/Nafion/ DMAc and H2PtCl6/Nafion/ DMF to 
have larger Pt ECSA than thosed prepared from 
H2PtCl6/Nafion/alcohol-H2O solutions. 
 
 
3.8.2. Pt ECSA of thin films prepared from Pt/Nafion 
solutions 
Table 5 shows the Pt ECSA of Pt/Nafion films 
prepared from Pt/Nafion solutions. Since the Pt 
particles precipitate in Nafion/alcohol-H2O solutions 
(Fig. 11), the Pt/Nafion electrodes were not prepared 
using Pt/Nafion/alcohol-H2O solutions. Table 5 
shows the Pt/Nafion electrodes prepared from 
Pt/Nafion/DMAc and Pt/Nafion/DMF solutions had 
similar Pt ECSA but smaller Pt ECSA than that 
prepared from Pt/Nafion/NMF solution. It might be 
the shear thinning behavior of Pt/Nafion/NMF 
solution

3.9.2. 7-layer MEAs with a Pt-C/Nafion layer near 
PEM and a Pt/Nafion layer prepared from 
H2PtCl6/Nafion solutions near GDL 
 
 Two 7-layer MEAs consisting of double 
catalyst layers (Fig. 23-b) were prepared. The double 
catalyst layers were fabricated using two sets of 
catalyst solutions, i.e. (1) Pt-C/Nafion/DMF and 
H2PtCl6/Nafion/IPA-H2O solutions (It’s i-V curves 
are shown in Fig. 27); and (2) Pt-C/Nafion/DMF and 
H2PtCl6/Nafion/DMF solutions (It’s i-V curves are 
shown in Fig. 28). The Pt
4+
 ion in the catalyst layer 
was then reduced to Pt particles, which formed the 
Pt-layer as shown in Fig. 23-b. The total Pt loadings 
were 0.5 mg/cm
2
 and 1.0 mg/cm
2
 at anode and 
cathode, respectively, which were same as those of 
5-layer MEAs shown in sec 3.9.1. In the anode 
catalyst layer of these MEAs, 0.4 g/cm
2
 of Pt loading 
was contributed from Pt-C (40 wt % Pt) layer and 0.1 
g/cm
2
 of Pt loading was contributed from Pt-layer; 
while in the cathode catalyst layer, 0.9 g/cm
2
 of Pt 
loading was contributed from Pt-C (40 wt % Pt)  
and 0.1 g/cm
2
 of Pt loading was contributed from 
Pt-layer. The particles sizes of the carbon powder 
support were around 80-100 nm, while the sizes of Pt 
particles were less than 10 nm. For MEAs with same 
total Pt loadings, the thickness of catalyst layers of 
the 7-layer MEA (Fig. 23-b) should be thinner than 
those of the 5-layer MEA, because the 7-layer MEA 
consists of lower content of large sizes carbon 
powders than 5-layer MEA. The lower thickness of 
catalyst layer caused lower proton transfer resistance 
in catalyst layer [ref Yu TL: J Power Sources 2010]. 
The MEA with a thin Pt layer rather than a Pt-C (40 
wt% Pt) layer locating near GDLs has more Pt 
particles locating GDLs, i.e. the inlets of H2 and O2 
gases, and more feasible for H2 and O2 gases to reach 
Pt particles. Thus the 7-layer MEA could have higher 
fuel cell performance the 5-layer MEA. Figs. 27 and 
28 are the i-V curves of the PEMFC unit cell tests of 
the 7-layer MEAs with catalyst layers fabricated 
using (1) Pt-C/Nafion/DMF and H2PtCl6/Nafion/ 
IPA-H2O solutions and (2) Pt-C/Nafion/DMF and 
H2PtCl6/Nafion/DMF solutions, respectively. 
Comparing the result of Fig. 27 with that of Fig. 24, 
and the result of Fig. 28 with that of Fig. 26, in which 
the catalyst layers were fabricated using the same 
solvents, we the 7-layer MEA had a higher fuel cell 
performance than the 5-layer MEA. Comparing the 
result of Fig. 27 with that of Fig. 28, in which both 
MEA are 7-layers, we found the MEA with catalyst 
layers fabricating using DMF solvent had a better 
fuel cell performance that that fabricated using 
IPA-H2O solvent. These results were consistent with 
the CV data of Table 4, which showed the Pt particles 
prepared from H2PtCl6/DMF solution had higher Pt 
ECSA than those prepared from H2PtCl6/IPA-H2O 
solution.

二、 與會心得 
本次研討會數篇論文發表重點在:“燃料電池模擬與電池最佳化設計”及“燃料電池技
術測試與失誤診斷(failure diagnosis)分析”.“燃料電池元件材料--質子交換膜及觸媒”之論文也
是今年之研討會的重點. 今年“燃料電池模擬與電池最佳化設計”之論文發表數量極多,包
括 Penn State Univ. Prof. C.Y. Wang (王朝陽), Sandia National Lab Dr Ken Chen (陳庚), 加拿大 
Univ of Victoria Prof Jay Sui (隋邦傑)等華裔學者十多位. 顯示華裔學者在此領域佔有極重要
的地位. Dr隋與元智大學燃料電池中心有良好之合作關係,目前與元智正進行 PEMFC MEA觸
媒塗布與結構分析模擬合作計畫.“燃料電池測試技術”以通用汽車公司Dr Lai (Dr賴業宏)針
對PEMFC-MEA材料測試分析與電池長時間操作之功率衰減失誤診斷分析有深入探討. Dr賴
長期在通用汽車公司燃料電池研發部門工作,對PEMFC-MEA材料品管測試極分析有極豐富的
經驗.每年定期回台作學術演講,對元智的燃料電池發展有很大的助益.  
PEMFC燃料電池材料科技- 主要是以質子交換膜及觸媒兩大項目為主. 其中質子交換膜
論文以法國High National School of Ingeneers Arts et Materials的Prof. F. Thominette 發表的 
“Hygrothermal Aging of Nafion”論文 ,針對Nafion質子交換膜長時間處於低濕高溫(Temp= 
60-100
o
C)的環境下的老化行為作探討. Prof. Thominette的報告Nafion在此環境下的老化行為
是可逆的. 只要給Nafion是量的溼度,則Nafion的機械及導電性質是可恢復的. 目前本研究室
正進行Nafion質子交換膜及MEA的長時間老化行為,進行診斷分析研究.元智大學也在會議中
發表兩篇質子交換膜相關論文. Prof Thominette的論文對我們後續研究具極大啟示作用.
