Abstract-We present the formulas for searching for the 
thresholds of regular and irregular low-density parity-
check (LDPC) codes under message-passing (MP) 
algorithm. A Gaussian approximation is applied to 
studying the evolution of the means of the messages of 
the variable nodes and the check nodes. Accurate 
numerical integration methods by using transformations 
are shown for evaluating the expected values of the 
message of the check nodes. Tables are built first and 
interpolations are used for further evaluations. Two 
curves are used to locate the threshold. We utilize an 
iterative decoding tunnel between these two curves and 
study the decoding performance by evaluating conditions 
of the derivatives of these two curves. Using this method 
the performance of both regular and irregular LDPC 
codes can be studied in a unified manner without using 
simulation.

I. INTRODUCTION 
n 1962 Gallager first discovered low-density parity-
check (LDPC) codes [1]. In 1993 turbo codes were 
discovered [2] and LDPC codes were rediscovered in 
1997 [3]. Both turbo codes and LDPC codes can 
approach the Shannon capacity limit for long code length. The 
advantages of LDPC codes over turbo codes are that decoding 
is parallelizable and the design and optimization methods can 
utilize the bipartite graph [4]. Due to the parallel decoding 
structure, high speed decoding is possible without using large 
amount of memory size and complexity of algorithm. The 
parallel structure has been shown to achieve over 100 Mb/s 
throughput compared with the 10 Mb/s throughputs of turbo 
codes [12]. Irregular LDPC codes can yield even lower 
thresholds than regular LDPC codes for large code length by 
optimizing the degree profile of the variable and the check 
nodes through density evolution [5]. 
In this paper we present a method for finding the thresholds 
of regular and irregular LDPC codes. Accurate evaluation of 
the threshold of a LDPC code with a certain degree 
distributions is important for designing a coding system 
approaching the Shannon limit. But it is difficult to direct 
optimize degree distributions using density evolution because 
it is a computation intensive work. Instead it is easier to use 
Gaussian approximation of the message densities for both 
regular and irregular LDPC codes. Not only the simplification 
makes the calculation faster, but also better understanding the 
behavior of the decoder. In this paper we will show the search 
method for the threshold by considering two curves that 
formed by a straight line and a curve formed by a sum of the 
weighted functions. 
It has been shown that Gaussian approximation works well 
for turbo codes. One can use it to trace the evolution of the 
messages. Due to iterative decoding the means may evolve to 
positive or negative infinity with high probability when 
certain conditions are satisfied. In our derivation no cycles are 
considered, but it has been reported that the results still 
worked well. 
In this paper, we first consider a regular binary LDPC code 
and then an irregular LDPC code is considered. Under the 
message passing algorithm, messages exchange between 
variable and check nodes. The analysis is based on the two 
curves formed by the expected values of the LLR messages 
sent from the variable nodes and check nodes. Derivatives of 
these curves are used to find the solutions. Based on the 
iterative MP decoding algorithm, the success of the decoding 
depends on the decoding tunnel’s shape. 
In this paper we will show how to accurately calculate the 
expected value of the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) message of a 
check node. Accurate evaluation of the expected value is 
important to ensure the success of the search of the threshold. 
Because the evaluation will be intensively used a table will be 
built for interpolation and inversion purposes. The analytic 
method derived by using Gaussian approximation will make 
the search for good node degree distributions much easier.  
II. THE DENSITY EVOLUTION METHOD  
In the message passing algorithm (MPA), messages 
transmit LLR back and forth at the edges of bipartite graph. 
There are two classes of nodes: variable nodes and check 
nodes. The edges pass messages to their connected nodes, 
where messages get updated iteratively.  
LDPC code may be defined by its parity check matrix 
H = },{ nmH , where =nmH , 0 or 1 [11]. Let )(lv  be the 
LLR message from variable nodes to check nodes in the lth 
iteration, and )(lu  be the LLR message from check nodes in 
the lth iteration. Define }1,:{)(M == nmHmn  as the set of 
edges that are connected to the nth variable node, and

As illustrated in Figure 1 the two curves can intercept at 
two, one, or no point. For the first case, decoding failures may 
occur. For the second case, thresholds can be located. For the 
last one, an iterative tunnel exists [10]. As shown in [12] when 
an iterative decoding tunnel is formed between these two 
curves, messages can evolve to infinity when an iterative 
decoding is adopted. Figure 3 shows the curves of )(1 xf  and 
)(2 xf  of a regular rate 1/2 LDPC code.

As before for the first curve )(1 xf , it is not related to the 
SNR and is determined by the degree profiles. So the shape of 
)(1 xf  can be modified by choosing various degree 
distributions. For another one )(2 xf , it is a straight line of 
slope η  and its location at the horizontal axis is at chmx = , 
which is decided by the SNR. Given the degree profiles we

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
Due to this rapid fall off to the error probability floors of 
LDPC codes, optimal code design will be compared by using 
thresholds instead of their bit error rates. As shown in the 
former sections, the degree distribution will change the slopes 
of the two curves and the threshold is decided by the slopes of 
them. Then it is nature to draw the curves of slopes and 
compare the points at which the slopes of )(1
1 xf−η  and 
)(2 xf   equal 1. The smaller the point is the lower thresholds 
may attain. 
For irregular LDPC codes there exits at least two roots of 
0)(''1
1 =− xfη . So one needs to restrict the search region 
over *),0( x  as shown in Figure 4. Because there may be 
many roots, it may generate many fixed points. So care should 
be taken when irregular code design is used although the 
threshold can be lower than the one for the same rate of 
regular code. 
Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the curves of )(1 xf  and 
)('1
1 xf−η  for various pairs of ( vd , cd ), respectively. The 
root of 1)('1
1 =− xfη  moves from 14.10 =x  to 1.20 =x  
when the components of the degree pair ( vd , cd ) get smaller. 
The curve )('1
1 xf−η  is more curly for the one of higher 
degrees of ( 20=vd , 9=cd ) than the one with ( 6=vd , 
5=cd ). 
One needs to be cautious that the values of )('1
1 xf−η  may 
be smaller than 1, and then the solution will not exist. In 
Figure 5 the curve )('1
1 xf−η  <1 for the degree pair ( 6=vd , 
5=cd ). This can be checked with the table of 
1)('1
1 =− xfη  before one starts the search for the solution. If 
no solution exists, then there may be some fix point and 
decoding failure may occur. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
We have shown the method for locating the thresholds for 
both regular and irregular LDPC codes without using 
simulations to find these values. The analysis is based on the 
two curves formed by the expected values of the LLR 
messages sent from the variable nodes and check nodes. 
Derivatives of these curves are used to find the solutions. 
Based on the iterative MP decoding algorithm, the success of
