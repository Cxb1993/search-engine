Governing Equations of Fluid in Well 
It is quite reasonable that homogeneous water in the well is 
assumed to be incompressible, inviscid and irrotational; and the fluid 
domains of the present study are shown in Figure 1. 
For regions (1) - (3), we let

Regular Perturbation Expansions 
Since the present study focuses on the problem of periodic linear 
water wave, we may introduce a time factor tie ω−  into the 
time-dependent variables. We shall use the same notation as 
time-dependent variables discussed earlier to represent the following 
time-independent variables for simplicity, where ω  is the angular 
frequency of weak incident pressure wave. 
Eqs. (4) and (9), together with boundary conditions (11) and 
(14)-(25), form a complete boundary-value-problem. However, 
because K  in (19) is much less than one, we may encounter a highly 
ill-conditioned system when solving undetermined coefficients by 
matrix. Hence, we have to further simplify the problem in order to 
solve it. 
Notice that by referring to reasonable order of magnitude of each 
variable such as 21010~ mk p − , 
28
10~ mNλ , ω 〜  100 s-1 , 
smkg ⋅−410~µ , and mR 110~ − , we find 
       (26)            
where κ  = volume bulk modulus of water, G  = Lame constant,

the amplitude of wave height is going to be infinite and resonance

Notice that the order of magnitude of H  is about 10  m , hence 
( ) 1tanh →Hkmn ; i.e. H  has no effect on the occurrence of resonance 
practically. 
 
RESULTS 
 
In the following discussion, we only apply the porosity 3.00 =n  
and the radius of well 2.0=R  m  for demonstration. More detailed 
data are given in Table 2. 
Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) show a comparison example of vertical contour 
distributions of perturbed velocity potential in the direction of 0=′θ  
in response to same incoming pressure wave with and without 
resonance (Fig. 3(a) for 1=m , 2=n ). From top to bottom are 
figures near free surface, Region 1, Region 2, and Region 3, 
respectively. It is observed that when a weak incident pressure wave 
transmitting into the well through the screen, the contours of velocity 
potentials vary significantly and violently in the top figure of  Fig. 
3(a) as resonance occurs, while it is quiescent in the top figure of  
Fig. 3(b) as resonance does not occur. It is also observed that since 
both the contours of velocity potentials in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) are 
discontinuous near the place of 20≅z  m , the incident pressure 
wave cannot cause resonance on free surface directly. We thus 
conclude that the weak pre-earthquake longitudinal pressure wave 
only plays the role as a trigger to disturb the initial equilibrium state 
of water in the well, while the main driving mechanism for resonance 
of transverse free  surface water wave is still the gravitational force. 
Notice that since the radius of observing well is so small, huge energy 
to disturb the equilibrium of well water is not necessary. In summary 
of Fig. 3, a weak pre-earthquake longitudinal pressure wave is only a 
triggering mechanism for the resonance of transverse gravitational
