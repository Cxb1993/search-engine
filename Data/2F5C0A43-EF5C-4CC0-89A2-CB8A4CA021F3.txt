reflectors, PPLN 
 We report the study and development results of the research works proposed in the NSC 
project “Development of tunable, narrow-line optical parametric oscillators in near- and mid-IR 
regions using 1D, 2D, and 3D Bragg mirrors” (NSC 98-2221-E-008-013-MY3). We aimed in this 
3-year project at developing a series of tunable, narrow-line optical parametric oscillation (OPO) 
systems potential for spectroscopy and remote-sensing applications. We have successfully 
accomplished the primary project goals and developed several novel and interesting OPO systems 
based on some unique photonic-crystal techniques. 
 In the first project year (2009-2010), we have developed a tunable intracavity OPO (IOPO) 
achieved using a two-dimensional (2D) periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) as 
simultaneously an electro-optic (EO) Bragg Q-switch and an optical frequency mixer in a 
diode-pumped Nd:YVO4 laser. We observed multi-wavelength generation from the system 
originating in the single-pass parametric conversions in the 2D nonlinear photonic crystal 
structure. Temperature tuning of the IOPO signal in the near- and mid-IR was also demonstrated. 
In the second project year (2010-2011), we have successfully constructed a narrow-line 
PPLN OPO system using dual 1D volume Bragg grating (VBG) mirrors. In this system, we have 
obtained an OPO output signal whose linewidth can be of as narrow as 65 pm, which has been a 
factor of >16 narrower than that obtained in a typical OPO system using dielectric mirrors. A 
wavelength tuning range of almost 300 nm in 1.5-m band can be achieved in 50o angle tuning. 
In the final project year (2011-2012), we further developed a unique spectral narrowing and 
manipulation technique in an OPO realized by an integrated PPLN comprising an optical 
parametric gain medium sandwiched by two EO polarization-mode converters (EO PMCs). We 
achieved a manipulation of the gain spectrum of the OPO via EO and/or temperature control of 
the EO PMCs, in which we obtained single to multiple signal spectral peaks from the OPO with a 
spectral width reduced by up to 10 times and peak intensity increased by up to 6 times in 
comparison with the original signal. Fast EO tuning of the narrowed signal spectral peak has also 
been demonstrated. We also implemented a 1D distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) in a Si-overlaid 
Er:Ti:LiNbO3 waveguide, from which a >94% reflection efficiency was obtained at 1530 nm with 
a 0.68 nm spectral width, which has been, to the best of our knowledge, the highest efficiency 
ever reported. 
Besides, during the technical support from other component projects in the first project year, 
we have developed the stacking technique of 3D microsphere PCs for the creation of band gaps 
centered at ~1064 and ~1550-nm wavelengths in a face centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure. We 
have also successfully implemented a 2D photonic-crystal structure in an Er:Ti:LiNbO3 
waveguide patterned by microspheres with the electric-field poling technique. 
We have published 8 SCI papers, 8 international conference papers, and 6 local conference 
papers at reporting the research results of the research works fully or partially supported by this 
NSC project. Six master-degree theses based on these research achievements have been 
accomplished. We acknowledge NSC the support to this project.

II. Motivation and Objective 
Coherent IR radiations are of interest for various applications including spectroscopy, optical 
communication, remote sensing, and range finder, etc. Tunable and narrow-line operation of these 
sources is of particular demand for spectroscopy and remote sensing applications. However, only 
few practical laser sources are nowadays available for working in especially the mid-IR spectral 
region. For example, some rare-earth lasers radiate at certain discrete lines in this region (e.g., 2.9 
m with Er:YAG and ~2.1 m with Ho, Tm:YAG). Thus taking advantage of nonlinear frequency 
conversion of readily available and powerful laser sources to the desired IR spectrum has been 
the popular means. OPO technology has been the most popular way of practice to down-convert 
the frequency of an existing laser source to this spectral region. To achieve narrow-line or even 
SLM operation in an OPO system, a cw SRO with a ring-resonator configuration is generally 
adopted [23, 24]. In this project, we proposed a series of novel OPO systems using advanced 
QPM wavelength conversion and multi-dimensional photonic crystal techniques to achieve the 
generation of tunable, narrow-line near and mid-IR radiations. The objective of the first project 
year is to develop 1.5-m/3.5-m bulk PPLN OPOs using the 1D VBGs as simultaneous the 
narrow-line oscillator mirrors and wavelength tuning elements; the objective of the second 
project year is to design and construct a narrow-line monolithic Nd:YVO4 laser using a 3D 
photonic-crystal reflection layer as its cavity mirror and a 1.5-m/3.5-m bulk PPLN OPO using 
such a 3D Bragg mirror as simultaneous the narrow-line oscillator mirror and wavelength tuning 
element will then be implemented and studied; and the objective of the third project year is to 
challenge the goal of constructing 1.5-m/3.5-m PPLN waveguide OPOs using a 1D distributed 
Bragg reflection structure inscribed in a Si layer over PPLN or a 2D electro-optically active 
(EOA) photonic-crystal structure built in the PPLN as the narrow-line reflection mirror. 
We believe the successful development of the technologies proposed in this project will 
certainly not only contribute to the spectroscopy and remote sensing applications but also be 
beneficial to various applications such as optical communication, range finder, countermeasures, 
biomedicine, displays, holography, military systems, etc. 
 
III. Background introduction (literature review) 
Optical parametric oscillation (OPO) has been one of the most promising techniques in 
producing wavelength tunable coherent radiations. Generally an OPO can be resonated on either 
or both of the two down-converted waves, called singly-resonant optical parametric oscillator 
(SRO) and doubly-resonant optical parametric oscillator (DRO), respectively. Depending on the 
cavity parameters, a cw DRO can have a pump threshold of a few hundred times lower than that 
of a cw SRO. However, the inherent spectral resonance instability in a DRO makes it a difficult 
system for achieving continuous tuning. The wavelength tuning and spectral narrowing 
mechanisms for an OPO can be built and functioned in a same element such as an intra-cavity 
etalon [25] or grazing incidence grating [26, 27]. To have a broader tuning range, several tuning 
mechanisms such as pump tuning, crystal temperature or angular tuning, and QPM crystal

where m is an integer representing the diffraction order,  is the wavelength, n is the wave 
refractive index, and  is the PPLN grating period. To integrate a PPLN EO Bragg deflector and 
a PPLN OFM in a common substrate, a 2D periodic domain inversion structure is thus required to 
provide two orthogonal reciprocal vectors to simultaneously compensate the wave-vector 
mismatches in the two nonlinear wave coupling processes. In this work, a 2D PPLN was 
constructed to work simultaneously as an active laser Q-switch and an OPGM to realize a pulsed 
IOPO in a simple linear laser cavity. The 2D PPLN, fabricated using the standard electric-field 
poling technique, has a dimension of 40 mm in length (along crystallographic x axis), 8 mm in 
width (along crystallographic y axis), and 0.78 mm in thickness. Figure 1 shows the schematic 
arrangement of the pulsed IOPO constructed in a 1064-nm Nd:YVO4 laser using the fabricated 
2D PPLN. The laser gain medium is an a-cut 0.3-at. % Nd:YVO4 crystal, having a 3 mm×3 mm 
clear aperture and 9 mm length. The pump laser is a fiber coupled diode laser at 809 nm. The 
1064-nm laser oscillates in a cavity formed by two high-reflection mirrors, designated M1 and 
M2. M1 is a 15-cm radius-of-curvature meniscus dielectric mirror having ~93% transmittance at 
809 nm and ~99.8% and >99.3% reflectance at 1064 and 1530-1580 nm, respectively. M2 is a 
plane-plane dielectric mirror having ~99.6% reflectance at 1064 nm and ~99.4% transmittance at 
1550 nm (>96% transmittance at 1500-1800 nm). A singly resonant oscillator (SRO), pumped by 
the 1064-nm laser intracavity power, resonates at the optical parametric signal generated from the 
2D PPLN in a resonator formed by mirror M1 and an output coupling mirror (designated M3). 
M3 is a plane-plane dielectric (BK7) mirror having ~60% reflectance at 1550 nm. The use of a 
relatively high output coupling ratio (40%) in mirror M3 is to suppress the emergence of 
unwanted satellite signal pulses usually observed in a high-gain IOPO [49]. The inset of Fig. 1 
shows a microscopic image of an HF-etched z surface of the 2D PPLN, revealing a tetragonal 
domain structure whose periodicities along the crystallographic x and y axes form a QPM grating 
of 30-m period to phase-match the 1064 nm pumped 1550 and 3393 nm optical parametric 
generation process at 40oC and an EO Bragg grating of 20-m period to phase-match the 
1064-nm Bragg diffraction process at B~0.7o, respectively. A 20-m-period Bragg grating was 
used due to the limit of our current electric-field poling technique for 2D domain engineering in 
LiNbO3, though a Bragg deflector with a shorter Bragg grating period and therefore a larger 
Bragg angle (refer to Eq. (1)) might be advantageous to its operation as a laser Q-switch since the 
laser diffraction loss (and therefore the hold-off capacity) introduced at the low-Q state increases 
with the diffraction angle. The two z surfaces of the 2D PPLN crystal were sputtered with NiCr 
alloy (in an area of 406 mm2) as the electrodes to apply the Ez in the crystal. Both of the end (x) 
faces of the crystal were optically polished and had an anti-reflection (AR) coating for 
wavelengths at 1064 and 1500-1600 nm.

Fig. 3. (a) Measured output peak power and pulse width of the 1550-nm IOPO signal as a function of the 
diode pump power. (b) Measured signal pulse (red line) and the corresponding 1064-nm pump pulse 
(depleted, green line) at the diode power of 9.1 W. A ~31% pump pulse-energy depletion was estimated 
from the fitted Gaussian pulse (dashed gray line). 
 
In operation, we drove the 2D PPLN with a 140-V, 300-ns voltage-pulse train at 1 kHz to 
activate its functionality as an EO Bragg Q switch. The 300-ns pulse duration corresponds to the 
Q-switch open time or the high cavity Q state, during which the 2D PPLN is pumped for 
parametric oscillation. Figure 3(a) shows the measured output pulse energy and pulse width of 
the IOPO signal at 1550 nm as a function of the diode pump power when the 2D PPLN was 
temperature controlled at 41.5oC. At the diode pump power of 9.1 W, we obtained the signal pulse 
energy of ~9.7 J, corresponding to a peak power of ~2.4 kW from the system. Figure 3(b) shows 
the measured 1550-nm signal pulse (~4-ns pulse width) and the corresponding 1064-nm pump 
pulse (depleted, green line) at the diode power of 9.1 W. A ~31% 1064-nm pump pulse-energy 
depletion was estimated from its reconstructed pulse with Gaussian fitting (dashed gray line). 
Since the 2D PPLN used in the present system is equivalently a 2D nonlinear photonic crystal 
(NPC) [13], multiple wavelength conversions via the optical parametric generation processes 
phase-matched in such a 2D reciprocal lattice are possible according to the QPM condition, given 
by

th and nth-order reciprocal 
vectors along the crystallographic x and y directions of the 2D PPLN, respectively, with x= 30 
m and y= 20 m in this work. Figure 4(a) shows the calculated signal (solid lines; refer to the 
left vertical axis) and the corresponding idler (dashed lines; refer to the right vertical axis) 
wavelength tuning curves versus their phase-matching angles with respect to the crystallographic 
x axis (symbolized by s and i for the signals and idlers, respectively) for the 1064-nm pump 
wave incident at near the Bragg angle (p~0.77o) in the 2D PPLN at 41.5oC. In this pump 
configuration and crystal temperature, the generated signal wavelength will be at 1550 nm when

[51]. The wave-vector matching diagrams of some representative QPM schemes (A-E and G) 
were plotted in Fig. 4(b) for reference. The increase of optical parametric gain is expected in Case 
I due to the least beam walk-off problem between the signal and idler couplings, while it is due to 
the enhancement of the effective nonlinear coefficient in Case II [51]. It deserves to note that 
point D in Fig. 4(a) presents a special scheme in which the parametric signal is commonly 
generated from two QPM processes involving both Cases I and II of gain enhancement. Figure 
4(c) shows the measured output signal spectrum of the IOPO at 9.1-W diode power with a grating 
spectrometer. In this measurement a cylindrical lens was used to facilitate the collection of those 
off-angle signals as well as the 1550-nm resonant signal. We indeed observed the emergence of 
multiple signal wavelengths over the spectral range of our measurement (1525-1800 nm), as 
shown in Fig. 4(c). The letters (A to J) labeled aside each measured spectral peak denote the 
QPM schemes (refer to Fig. 4(a)) that contribute to that wavelength generation. The letters in 
parentheses denote the QPM schemes that contribute to signal generations whose wavelengths are 
located within the spectral band of an observed peak and might jointly contribute to the formation 
of that spectral peak. The inset shows the enlargement of a lower portion of the obtained 
spectrum to present a more detailed spectral content. The 1550-nm signal oscillates with the 
QPM scheme A using K1,0 (see Figs. 4(a) and 4(b)). Compared to the 1550-nm resonant wave, 
other simultaneously measured signals were with much less intensity due to their non-resonant 
(off-angle), single-pass generation process. Nevertheless, the gain enhancement effect with the 
QPM scheme D is indeed obvious. Besides, the relatively long intersection of the K1,1 and K1,2 
idler curves along the vertical (wavelength) axis at scheme J (see Fig. 4(a)) has resulted in the 
formation of a relatively broad signal band around 1790 nm (see Fig. 4(c)).

Continuous signal wavelength tuning in the present IOPO system was also demonstrated in 
the NIR/MIR region via the temperature control of the 2D PPLN, as shown in Fig. 5 (the

higher than 99% at its central diffraction wavelength ~1064.4 nm at room temperature. One of the 
1064-nm VBG surfaces (S1) was polished to have a 10-deg angle with respect to the Bragg 
grating surface planes and applied with a coating which is highly reflective at 1.5-m band and 
anti-reflective at 1064 nm. This is to form a Z-shape cavity for the OPO. The OPO signal 
oscillates in the Z-shape cavity formed by the mirror M1, the S1 surface of the 1064-nm VBG, 
and another VBG reflector (M3) whose central diffraction wavelength is at ~1560.1 nm 
(diffraction efficiency >99%) at room temperature. The reflection spectral bandwidths (FWHM) 
of the 1064-nm and 1560-nm VBGs are 0.3 and 0.54 nm, respectively. In this work, a 2D PPLN 
was constructed to work simultaneously as an active laser Q-switch and an OPGM to realize a 
pulsed intracavity OPO (IOPO) system in such a simple linear laser cavity, as constructed and 
characterized in the prior work (see section IV-I). Since the PPLN Q switch is electro-optically 
active, cw operation of this IOPO can be readily available if no external field is applied to the Q 
switch.  
In operation, we drove the 2D PPLN with a 140V, 300-ns voltage-pulse train at 1 kHz to 
activate its functionality as an EO Bragg Q switch. The 300-ns pulse duration corresponds to the 
Q-switch open time or the high cavity Q state. To study the spectral narrowing effect of the 
1064-nm laser using VBG on the output spectrum of the pumped IOPO, we measured and 
compared the output spectra of the IOPO signals from the system when a typical dielectric-coated 
high-reflectivity (HR) mirror (>99.6% at 1064 nm) and the 1064-nm VBG were used as the M2 
mirror of the 1064-nm laser (refer to Fig. 6), respectively. Figure 7 shows the measured output 
spectra of the 1064-nm laser with the VBG output coupler (red line) and the dielectric mirror 
(blue line) when pumped at 10.4-W diode power. A high-resolution optical spectrum analyzer 
(OSA) was used for the spectral measurement in this work. It clearly shows a remarkable 
reduction of laser linewidth of ~3.5 times has been achieved with the system using VBG. Figure 8 
shows the corresponding output spectra of the intracavity optical parametric generation (IOPG) 
from the 1064-nm laser with the VBG output coupler (red line) and the dielectric mirror (blue 
line). It shows the two OPG spectra have comparable linewidths (though a narrower linewidth is 
still obtained with a VBG system), which can be understood as the OPG spectrum is usually 
much broader than its pump laser line. This observation further suggests that the output linewidth 
of the IOPO system shown in Fig. 6 might depend less on the spectral width of the 1064-nm 
pump laser. To investigate the best IOPO configuration in using the VBG mirrors for the 
narrow-line signal generation, in this work we have constructed another 3 experimental schemes 
based on the scheme shown in Fig. 6 (referred as scheme I) via the replacement of the 1064-nm 
VBG mirror (M2) with a 1064-nm HR dielectric mirror (referred as scheme II and shown in Fig. 
9), the replacement of the 1560-nm VBG mirror (M3) with a 1550-nm band HR dielectric mirror 
(referred as scheme III and shown in Fig. 10), and the replacement of the 1064 and 1560-nm 
VBG mirrors (M2 and M3) with a 1064-nm and a 1550-nm-band HR dielectric mirrors (referred 
as scheme IV and shown in Fig. 11), respectively.

via the rotation of the VBG surface normal with respect to the wave incident direction. As we 
have calculated in the proposal, a wavelength tuning range of almost 300 nm in 1.5-m band can 
be achieved in 50o angle tuning (from 10o-60o). 
 
IV-III. Spectral narrowing and manipulation in an optical parametric oscillator using PPLN 
electro-optic polarization-mode converters 
 Besides the tunability, many applications such as spectroscopy, communication, light 
detection and ranging (LIDAR), and remote sensing demand light sources working at a narrow 
linewidth. Thus, a spectral narrowing mechanism needs to be introduced to the OPO (especially 
for a pulsed OPO usually characterized by a broader bandwidth) to meet the requirements of 
these applications. Several methods have been studied to achieve that purpose, among which the 
insertion of wavelength selective elements such as etalons, birefringence filters, or 
grazing-incident (GI) gratings in the cavity has been the most common practice [53]. 
Nevertheless, the addition of intracavity elements inevitably increases the systems loss as well as 
the systems complexity. The recent development of glass based volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) 
as resonator reflectors has facilitated the construction of a narrow-line OPO without the aid of 
extra elements. However, linewidth control and spectral tuning of those OPOs have been based 
on the use of passive elements operated in slow mechanical tuning schemes. 
 In this work, we have integrated two PPLN EO PMCs with a PPLN optical parametric gain 
medium (OPGM) in a monolithic LiNbO3 to achieve unique spectral manipulations in an OPO 
system. In particular, we have demonstrated a spectrally narrowed OPO signal with enhanced 
spectral intensity in this configuration. This demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, is the 
first result of a pulsed narrow-line OPO whose spectral narrowing (and tuning) mechanism is 
electro-optically active and directly built in the same substrate along with the OPGM. The 
monolithic design provides lower insertion loss and allows for better system integration 
compared to conventional schemes using a separate linewidth-control element. 
 Figure 15 shows the schematic arrangement of the integrated PPLN device comprising a 
3-cm-long PPLN OPGM and two 1.25-cm-long PPLN EO PMCs (referred to the figure labels as 
the first and second PPLN EO PMCs, respectively). The PPLN EO PMCs have a grating period 
of 21 m phase-matched to the codirectionally coupled Šolc-type Bragg condition at 1532 nm at 
40oC [54]. The PPLN OPGM is sandwiched between the two PPLN EO PMCs and has a grating 
period of 29.8 m phase-matched to the 1064-nm pumped 1532-nm signal and 3483-nm idler 
parametric generation process at 40oC. In this device, the PPLN OPGM generates and amplifies 
only the extraordinary (e)-polarized waves satisfying the eee QPM condition, while the PPLN EO 
PMCs perform narrow-band eordinary (o) polarization-mode conversion at the signal wave. 
The PPLN EO PMCs thus act like a pair of active notch filters in this system. Since the 
conversion spectrum of a PPLN EO PMC depends on the driving field and the temperature (see 
below), it is possible to tailor a specific gain spectrum for the signal oscillation depending on the 
overlap of the conversion spectra of the EO PMCs and the OPGM. A unique spectral narrowing 
or manipulation mechanism can then be obtained in an OPO system based on the presented 
integrated PPLN device. 
 19 
Since the OPO spectrum is a result of the overlap of the lineshape functions of the OPGM and the 
intracavity linewidth-control element(s) after multiple transits in the resonator [53], we have 
developed an algorithm based on the coupled-mode theory of the involved nonlinear 
wave-coupling processes implemented in an iterative round-trip model to simulate the output 
spectrum of the presented OPO system.

93 and 1168 V/mm, provided a flat-spectrum signal wave is generated from the OPGM. Both PMCs are 
operated with identical driving fields. The solid gray line represents the actual single-pass signal spectrum 
with the PPLN OPGM pumped by a 61-MW/cm2 1064-nm wave. 
 
We fabricated the integrated PPLN crystal (Fig. 15) in a 55-mm long, 1-mm wide, and 
0.5-mm thick z-cut LiNbO3 crystal by using the standard electric-field poling technique. Both of 
the end (x) faces of this crystal received an optical grade polish and an anti-reflection (AR) 
coating for both 1064 nm and 1532 nm. The two y faces of the PPLN EO PMCs were sputtered 
with NiCr alloy to form the side electrodes. The fabricated PPLN crystal was mounted in a 
3-zone temperature controlled oven and positioned in a linear resonator formed by two identical, 
100-mm radius-of-curvature BK7 mirrors having coating layers of ~95% reflectance at 
1520-1560 nm and >99.9% transmittance at 1064 nm. The operating temperatures of the two EO 
PMCs can be separately controlled and detuned by 3oC from that of the PPLN OPGM. The pump 
source is a linearly-polarized, actively Q-switched Nd:YAG laser generating 10-Hz repetition-rate 
1064-nm pulses of duration ~7 ns. The peak pump power input to the OPO system is ~23 kW, 
which is around 6 times above the threshold power. The pump beam size in the crystal is ~220 
m. An optical spectrum analyzer with a spectral resolution of 0.01 nm was used to measure the 
signal output spectra. Figures 17 and 18 show the measured (solid black line) and calculated 
(dashed gray line) output signal spectra from the OPO system using the unique spectral 
manipulation technique introduced above. The vertical scales in the two figures are directly 
comparable. The operational parameters used to obtain the presented spectra are summarized in 
the figure legends, where TOPGM, TPMC1, and TPMC2 denote the operating temperatures of the PPLN 
OPGM and the first and second PPLN EO PMCs, while EPMC1 and EPMC2 represent the EO 
driving fields of the two PMCs. The corresponding OPO signal spectrum from the system with

Figures 17(b) and 17(c) show the resultant signal spectra when the EO driving fields of the 
system are switched to EPMC1=1060 V/mm and EPMC2=700 V/mm and to EPMC1=900 V/mm and 
EPMC2=800 V/mm, respectively. Figure 18 shows the results when the system is operated to 
produce 2 and 3 signal spectral peaks in the OPO gain bandwidth with the presented technique. 
Notably again, the output spectra shown in Figs. 18(a) and 18(b) can be switched instantaneously 
by changing the applied electric fields using the EO effect. The discrepancy between measured 
and calculated spectra in Figs. 17 and 18 can be attributed to the plane-wave approximation used 
in the algorithm and in particular to the temperature gradient at the interfaces of the PPLN OPGM 
and EO PMCs sections of the monolithic device configuration. 
 
IV-IV. Development of multi-dimensional Bragg (photonic-crystal) elements/devices 
 We first implemented a 1D distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) in an Er:Ti:LiNbO3 waveguide 
to demonstrate its functionality as simultaneously a laser mirror and a spectral narrowing element. 
The DBR structure is realized in a Si layer overlaid the LiNbO3 waveguides due to the difficulty 
of engineering an efficient grating/corrugation structure directly in the crystal itself. A 2-cm long, 
5-mm wide, and 0.5-mm thick z-cut LiNbO3 sample was over-coated with Er2O3 layer of 
thickness 10 nm on the –z surface. Since the high-temperature ion diffusion process will form a 
domain-inverted layer on the +z surface of a LiNbO3 crystal [57], in this manner we avoid 
subsequent difficulty in relation to electric field poling when fabricating the PPLN gratings. We 
further coated the +z surface of the lithium niobate substrate with a thin layer of SiO2 to prevent 
the crystal domain from inversion during high-temperature diffusion. The sample was then loaded 
in a loosely covered sapphire boat and heated in a 3-zone furnace at 1100oC for 60 hours under a 
constant oxygen flow. There was some LiNbO3 powder surrounding the sample in the sapphire 
boat for reducing the Li2O out-diffusion problem [58]. An array of 90-nm thick, 8-m wide Ti 
strips with a 100-m period was then fabricated on the –z surface of the LiNbO3 crystal using the 
standard lithographic and lift-off processes. The sample was again heated in the furnace at 
1035oC for 12 hours for performing the Ti in-diffusion to form the channel waveguides in it. With 
these fabrication parameters, a low-loss and single-mode Ti:LiNbO3 waveguide at 1550-nm band 
can be obtained [54]. A Si overlay of area 5mm5mm and thickness ~0.4m was sputtered onto 
one end section of the Er:Ti:LiNbO3 waveguide device. The layer thickness of ~0.4m was 
experimentally deduced for achieving the best Bragg reflection efficiency at 1550-nm wave. After 
the Si overlay sputtering, a thin photoresist was coated over the Si layer for the follow-up 
holographic writing of the Bragg grating structure with a system shown in Fig. 19. This laser 
two-beam interferometer has been employed to expose the 1st order Bragg grating on the 
Si-overlaiod Er:Ti:LiNbO3 waveguide device. The Bragg grating period is around 0.36 m for 
~1.55-m wavelength guided wave according to the Bragg condition. To expose a sub-micron 
period grating on the layer, we used a stable and long coherence length gas laser He-Cd laser as 
the illumination source. The laser is linearly polarized and radiates at 442 nm. The laser beam 
was first expanded through a spatial filter to enhance the grating contrast and the uniformity of 
the interference pattern on the sample. The beam was then divided into two coherent beams by a 
non-polarizing cube beamsplitter (NPBS). The two split beams were then deflected by two

In contrast to a 1D photonic crystal (PC) like the VBG, a 3D PC whose crystal structure can 
be designed and engineered to achieve the manipulation of its linear and nonlinear optical 
properties and has been found interesting for many applications including waveguide optics, fiber 
optics, wave engineering, laser resonators, interferometers, etc. In this work, we developed an 
interesting technology of implementing 3D photonic-crystal structures via the stack of silica 
microspheres. The sizes of the microspheres used in this experiment are 450 and 680 nm in 
diameter for the creation of band gaps centered at ~1064 and ~1500-nm wavelengths, 
respectively, if a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice structure is stacked by these silica microspheres 
(refractive index~1.48) according to the Bragg’s law [59-61]. The stacking process of the 
implementation of the 3D microsphere PCs is illustrated in Fig. 22, where a quartz cuvette of 0.1 
mL in volume was used to confine and stack up the silica microspheres originally prepared in 
water or alcohol solution. Natural or thermal (~50oC) drying of the microsphere solution has been 
used to form the solid bulk 3D microsphere PCs. Figure 23 shows the SEM images of the 
fabricated 3D microsphere PCs, where stacking layers can be observed through some openings in 
the surface layer due to the peelings during the SEM photographic process. Figures 24 shows the 
calculated band gap structures in the first Brillouin zone from a high index-difference (n=0.48; 
silica-air) microsphere photonic crystals using the plane wave expansion method. Circled 
portions show where the band gaps can be possibly used for narrow-band reflection. Figure 25 
shows the characterized transmittance of the fabricated 3D microsphere (~680 nm in diameter) 
PCs, where a relatively broad transmission bandwidth was obtained due to the large n=0.48. To 
obtain a high Q-value of the structure (corresponding to a narrow Bragg refraction bandwidth), it 
actually requires a low refractive-index difference photonic-crystal structure.

nanophotonics applications and deserves to be further developed. When the poled 2D structure is 
either etched or applied with an electric field Ez along the z-axis of a LiNbO3 device, a passive or 
active 2D PC is formed. We have calculated the Bragg reflection spectrum of the 2D PC in a 
60-m long (the computer capacity limits the simulation of a longer device) Er:Ti:LiNbO3 
waveguide when applied with an Ez~19 kV/mm (corresponding to a n=0.003), as shown in Fig. 
28. It indeed shows a Bragg reflection peak at ~1080 nm can be obtained from such a 2D PC. To 
shift the reflection spectrum to the 1.5 m telecom band, we estimated the size of the 
microspheres for used in the electric-field poling should be around 700 nm in diameter. 
 
IV. Discussion and Conclusions 
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a series of tunable, narrow-line optical 
parametric oscillation (OPO) systems potential for spectroscopy and remote-sensing applications. 
In the first project year, we have devoted to the development of a tunable intracavity optical 
parametric oscillator (IOPO) achieved using a two-dimensional (2D) PPLN nonlinear photonic 
crystal (NPC). The 2D PPLN, building in a z-cut, 40-mm long (along crystallographic x axis), 
8-mm wide (along crystallographic y axis), and 0.78-mm thick LiNbO3, has a tetragonal domain 
structure whose periodicities along the crystallographic x and y axes form QPM gratings of 30- 
and 20-m periods, respectively, phase-matched to the nonlinear optical conversion processes in 
the PPLN OPGM and the PPLN EO Bragg deflector. When driving the 2D PPLN with 140-V 
pulses at 1 kHz, we obtained a signal at 1550 nm from the IOPO system with a pulse energy of 
~9.7 μJ, corresponding to a peak power of ~2.4 kW, at 9.1-W diode pump power. We also 
observed multi-wavelength parametric generation from the system, as predicted from the 
characteristic phase-matching schemes in the 2D NPC structure. Continuous wavelength tuning 
of the IOPO signal in the eye-safe region via the temperature control of the 2D PPLN was also 
achieved.  
In the second project year, we have successfully developed 1.5-m/3.5-m bulk PPLN 
OPOs using 1D VBGs as simultaneously the narrow-line oscillator mirrors and wavelength 
tuning elements. In the constructed system, a 2D PPLN was used to be simultaneously an optical 
parametric gain medium (OPGM) and an EO Bragg Q-switch and two VBGs were employed to 
work as a 1064-nm laser mirror and a 1560-nm-band OPO mirror, respectively. To investigate the 
best IOPO configuration in using the VBG mirrors for the narrow-line signal generation, in this 
work we have constructed another 3 experimental schemes based on the scheme using dual VBGs 
(refer to Figs. 6, 9-11) and concluded that it is the VBG used in the IOPO (i.e., the 1560-nm VBG) 
playing the crucial role on the spectral-narrowing mechanism of the system. In the IOPO system 
using dual VBGs, we produced the narrowest OPO signal linewidth (~65 pm), which has been a 
factor of >16 in linewidth reduction compared to the system with dual dielectric couplers 
(linewidth ~1.06 nm). A 1560-nm signal peak power of >700 W was obtained with this 
narrow-line dual-VBG IOPO system at 10.4-W diode power. Continuous laser wavelength tuning 
is possible via the rotation of the VBG surface normal with respect to the wave incident direction. 
A wavelength tuning range of almost 300 nm in 1.5-m band can be achieved in 50o angle tuning 
(from 10o-60o).
