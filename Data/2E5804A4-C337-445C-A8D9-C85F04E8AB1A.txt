mobility, it is hard to determine when to 
perform and how many mobile stations 
should be relocated. Moreover, the CSN 
anchored mobility causes users to change 
the serving gateway. Other protocols and 
procedures would be affected. We propose 
gateway relocation algorithms to determine 
when to perform CSN anchored mobility. 
With our proposed gateway relocation 
algorithms, the overhead of performing 
relocation procedures can be reduced.

二、研究背景與目的 
The major objective of this project 
is to design and improve the resource 
manage mechanisms in IEEE 
802.16/802.11 heterogeneous all-IP core 
networks. This project considers two 
topics as following: 
 
1. Efficient Energy Saving 
Mechanism for IEEE 802.16e 
Wireless MANs 
The IEEE 802.16 standard [1] is a 
promising standard for next generation 
broadband wireless access networks. It 
provides last mile solution and supports 
high-speed multimedia services. The 
IEEE 802.16e amendment [2] enhances 
IEEE 802.16 with mobility support for 
users moving at vehicular speeds. Like 
other wireless mobile systems, how to 
conserve energy is critical for Mobile 
Stations (MSs) in 802.16e. Therefore, 
how to support sleep mode is one of the 
major extensions from 802.16 to 
802.16e.  
 In 802.16e, Base Station (BS) 
keeps one or several contexts for the MS 
the BS is currently serving. Each context 
is related to a certain Power Saving 
Class which is a set of connections with 
common properties. There are three 
types of Power Saving Classes: Type I, 
Type II, and Type III. Power Saving 
Class of Type I is recommended for Best 
Effort (BE) and Non-Real-Time 
Variable Rate (NRT-VR) traffic. 
Type II is for Unsolicited Grant Service 
(UGS) and Real-Time Variable Rate 
(RT-VR). Type III is for multicast 
connections as well as management 
operations. Although each type of 
Power Saving Class is recommended for 
some traffic types, the recommendations 
are not mandatory. 
When a Power Saving Class is 
activated, the MS will enter sleep mode 
to conserve energy. Different class has 
different parameters, activation/ 
deactivation procedures, and data 
transmission methods. For Power Saving 
Class of Type I, after the first sleep 
window, the MS wakes up for a fixed 
listening window to check whether the 
BS has downlink data for this MS. If 
there are data buffered in the BS for the 
MS, the MS deactivates the Power 
Saving Class of Type I and returns to 
normal operation. Otherwise, the MS 
starts another sleep window which 
doubles the length of the previous sleep 
window. The process repeats whenever 
there is no data buffered in the BS for 
the MS. There is a maximum length for 
sleep window defined in the standard. 
The length of sleep window will not 
double again when the maximum is 
reached. The idea in Power Saving Class 
of Type II is similar except that the sleep 
window has a fixed length. That is, all 
sleep windows are with the same length 
of the initial sleep window. Sleep 
windows are interleaved with listening 
windows of fixed duration. Power 
Saving Class of Type III works in a 
similar manner, except that it is active 
for only one sleep window. After one 
sleep window, the Power Saving Class 
of Type III is then deactivated. It goes 
back to normal operation. 
 In 802.16e, the unavailability 
 4
IETF RFC 3344) is adopted by WiMAX 
Forum. The Home Agent (HA) of a 
Mobile Station (MS) is located in the 
CSN of the MS’s Home Network 
Service Provider (H-NSP). ASN GW 
supports the Foreign Agent (FA) 
functionality.  
 
Fig. 2 WiMAX End-to-End Network Systems 
Architecture 
In the WiMAX End-to-End 
Network Systems Architecture, ASN 
anchored mobility and CSN anchored 
mobility are defined. ASN anchored 
mobility management refers to the 
procedures associated with the MS’s 
movement between BSs and ASNs 
without changing the reference point R3. 
However, CSN anchored mobility 
management is based on MIP for 
constructing new R3 between CSN and 
the new ASN GW. Fig. 2 shows the 
ASN anchored mobility and CSN 
anchored mobility. When an MS is 
admitted into the network and connected 
to ASN A, a connection is established 
between MS, BS A, ASN GW A, and 
HA. Please refer to Flow (1) in Fig. 2. 
We call the MS as a serving MS of ASN 
GW A. After that, the MS may move 
from ASN A to ASN B as indicated by 
Flow (2). As defined in the standards, 
the MS can perform ASN anchored 
mobility without performing CSN 
anchored mobility. Therefore, a new 
connection, Flow (3), is established 
between the MS, BS B, ASN GW B, 
ASN GW A and HA. Thus, the original 
tunnel in R3 between ASN GW A and 
HA is still maintained. Now, ASN GW 
A and ASN GW B are referred to as the 
anchored ASN GW and serving ASN GW, 
respectively, of the MS. We call the MS 
as an anchored MS of ASN GW A and a 
handover MS of ASN GWB. Traffic is 
always relayed between ASN GW A and 
ASN GW B. If MS performs inter-ASN 
handover without performing CSN 
anchored mobility again, the serving 
ASN GW is replaced by the new ASN 
GW and the anchored ASN GW is still 
ASN GW A. Each MS at most can be 
served by two ASN GWs 
simultaneously. By this way, packet loss 
and handover latency could be reduced 
because an MS does not need to perform 
CSN anchored mobility for each 
inter-ASN handover. However, 
end-to-end delay might be longer. In 
addition, the load of ASN GW A, the 
anchored ASN GW, may become very 
heavy if there are many anchored MSs. 
Therefore, at some point, the system 
needs to perform ASN GW relocation. 
That is, some anchored MSs need to 
perform CSN anchored mobility. After 
that, a new connection, Flow (4), is 
established between MS, BS B, ASN 
GW B, and HA. A new tunnel in the 
new R3 is established between ASN 
GW B and HA. ASN GW A then no 
longer serves the MS. The old tunnel in 
the old R3 between ASN GW A and HA 
is also released. 
In this project, we consider the 
ASN GW relocation problem in the 
WiMAX End-to-End Network Systems 
Architecture. As one can see from above 
example, when to perform the ASN GW 
relocation will have great impact on the 
system performance. If ASN and CSN 
anchored mobility handovers are 
performed simultaneously, it would 
incur large handover latency. However, 
as the number of MSs anchored with the 
old ASN GW increases, the load of the 
old ASN GW increases too. It will 
degrade the performance. Moreover, as 
specified in the standards, the MS needs 
to get a new CoA from the new serving 
 6
this observation, we propose an 
algorithm to dynamically adjust the start 
frame number of each Power Saving 
Class so the unavailability interval is 
maximized. Therefore, energy 
consumption can be significantly 
reduced. Because the proposed 
algorithm does not change the lengths of 
sleep and listening windows, the QoS 
requirements are not changed. 
Because the Chinese Remainder 
Theorem is used in the proposed MUI, 
Section 1.1 brie y describes the Chinese 
Remainder Theorem. The proposed MUI 
is then presented in Section 1.2. Section 
1.3 discusses how to further reduce the 
computational complexity. 
1.1  Chinese Remainder Theorem 
The Chinese Remainder Theorem 
[6], [7] is widely used to solve the 
mathematical problem which appears in 
the following form: 
Let m1, m2,…, mt denote t positive 
integers that are relatively prime in pairs, 
that is, gcd(mi;mj ) = 1; for all i ≠ j, 1 ≤ i, 
j ≤ t. Let r1, r2,…, rt denote any t integers. 
There are many solutions of x which can 
satisfy the following system of 
simultaneous congruences: 
 
x ≡ r1 (mod m1) 
x ≡ r2 (mod m2) 
… 
         x ≡ rt (mod mt)        (1) 
If a special solution x0 is one of the 
solutions and it satisfies the above 
congruences, the following equation 
holds: 
  
x = x0 + km, for some integer k    (2) 
where, m = m1 × m2 ×…× mt. 
If these mj, j in {1, 2,…, t} are not 
pairwise relatively prime, the solutions 
can be found if and only if the following 
condition is satisfied: 
 
rp≡rq (mod gcd(mp,mq)), for all p ≠q (3) 
where p,q in {1,2,…t}. 
In this case, m in Equation (2) is 
the least common multiple of the mj . 
The Euclidean algorithm [7] can be used 
to find the solutions of x. 
1.2 Proposed Maximum Unavailability 
Interval (MUI) 
As shown in Fig. 1, we define Sleep 
Cycle as a time interval which comprises 
one sleep window and one listening 
window. It is clear that the Sleep Cycle 
of each Power Saving Class of Type II 
has a fixed length. Also, the unit of 
sleep/listening window is a frame. 
Assuming that the first frame is 
numbered as 1 as shown in Fig. 1. If the 
start frame number for first sleep 
window of a Power Saving Class is f, 
the xth frame which is within a sleep 
window can be defined as: 
 
x ≡ r  (mod m),  r= f, f+1,…,f+s-1 (4) 
where s is the length of the sleep 
window, and m is the length of the sleep 
cycle. 
 Now, we consider that an MS with 
t active Power Saving Classes of Type II. 
We denote the start frame numbers for 
the first sleep windows as fi. Also, we 
denote the length of sleep window as si 
and the length of a sleep cycle as mi for 
Class i. To determine whether a frame is 
within the unavailability interval, we 
need to determine whether the frame is 
within the sleep windows of all classes. 
Thus, we want to find the xth frame 
given by: 
 
x ≡ r1 (mod m1),  r1 =f1, f1+1,…,f1+s1-1 
x ≡ r2 (mod m2),  r2 =f2, f2+1,…,f2+s2-1 
          … , … 
x ≡ rt (mod mt),  rt =ft, ft+1,…,f1+st -1 
The problem is similar to the 
Chinese Remainder Theorem problem 
discussed in Section 1.1 except that 
there are now si remainders for the ith 
congruence. We can find all of the 
solutions of x by solving n (n=s1 × s2 
×…×st) such problems. Each one takes 
one of the ri for congruence i. Thus, 
there are s1×s2×…×st permutations for 
 8
table for the intersections of row 1,2 and 
column 1,2,3,4. We get four solutions 
1,9,2,10 for x0 and four blanks. We can 
get c1,1 = 1 as one solution of x0 for the 
congruences with ra = 1, rb = 1, and c1,3 
= 9 for ra = 1, rb = 3, c2,2 = 2 for ra = 2, 
rb = 2, c2;4 = 10 for ra = 2, rb = 4. The 
four blanks of (ra; rb) = (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), 
(2,3) represent that there is no solution 
for the congruences with these (ra,rb), 
which can be examined easily by 
Equation (3). By looking at the table, we 
can simultaneously get all solutions of x0 
for a set of Power Saving Classes with 
certain start frames. For other sets of 
start frames, we use different ranges of 
ra and rb, and still look at the same table 
for the intersections of rows and 
columns to get the solutions of x0 by 
using the same technique. 
 After we get all solutions of x0, the 
two Power Saving Classes can be 
regarded as one Power Saving Class, 
which is referred to as a pseudo Power 
Saving Class, with sleep cycle length 
m1,2 = lcm(4,6) = 12. The new pseudo 
Power Saving Class sleeps at 1st,2nd,9th, 
and 10th frames in a sleep cycle. When 
there are more than two Power Saving 
Classes, we can use the same technique 
described above to derive the solutions 
of x0 of the pseudo Power Saving Class 
with the third Power Saving Class. By 
repeating the same process, the 
maximum unavailability interval of all 
Power Saving Classes can be derived. 
The computational complexity of the 
proposed Table based Algorithm is 
presented in Section 1.4, which shows 
the new technique can reduce the 
computational complexity significantly. 
1.4 Performance evaluation 
z Analysis of Energy Consumption 
We have conducted extensive 
simulation to analyze the performance. 
Due to space limitation, we only show 
two figures. Showing other figures with 
different parameters will not change the 
conclusion drawn from the two figures. 
In the simulation, there are three 
Power Saving Classes of Type II with 
sleep cycles of 15, 35 and 21 frames. 
The sleep window length of one class is 
7. One is 15. The third one varies from 1 
to 20 as shown in the x-axis of Fig. 3. 
The start frame numbers of the first two 
classes are fixed too. The start frame 
number of the third class varies from 1 
to 5 as illustrated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 
demonstrates the number of frames 
within unavailability interval in every 
105 frames. As expected, when the sleep 
window length increases, the number of 
frames within unavailability interval 
increases too. However, the result of 
changing the start frame number is 
unpredictable. This demonstrates that 
how to choose a proper start frame 
number is nontrivial. 
 
Fig. 3 Number of frames in unavailability 
interval: parameters in two classes are fixed; 
varying the parameters in the third class. 
Next, we consider all combinations 
of different start frame numbers for all 
three classes. By using the proposed 
MUI, we can always derive the 
maximum number of frames in the 
unavailability interval. By using the 
proposed MUI, the minimum can be 
known too. Fig. 4 shows the maximum 
and minimum numbers of frames in 
unavailability interval. As discussed in 
Fig. 3, without using the proposed MUI, 
one may result in any number of frames 
in unavailability interval ranging 
between the minimum and maximum. 
However, when using the proposed MUI, 
 10
dropped packets also are taken into 
account. As a result, we define a metric, 
Drop Ratio (DR) which is defined as the 
ratio of the number of marked and 
dropped packets to the number of the 
received packets in one time interval. 
DR is continuously measured at each 
time interval. Only the packets of 
anchored MSs are considered. DR, thus, 
indicates the load of anchored MSs in 
the ASN GW. However, the overload 
problem in ASN GW is still not solved 
totally yet without relocation.  
For UDP traffic, the DR is always 
increased if the arrival rate of the UDP 
packets is largely increasing in ASN 
GW. For TCP traffic, TCP inherently 
decreases its transmission rate while 
many TCP packets are marked or 
dropped. Although DR is not increased 
significantly, the TCP throughput will 
be decreased. Therefore, the 
performance of ASN GW is also 
affected. As a result, we propose two 
algorithms to solve the overload 
problem by determining an appropriate 
time for ASN GW relocation. By using 
our algorithms, ASN GW has small 
chance to be overloaded. The ASN GW 
relocation will not be performed 
frequently. Moreover, the predictive 
ASN GW relocation algorithm can 
accurately estimate the load of an ASN 
GW so the ASN GW relocation 
procedure can be carried out early.  
3.1 Non-predictive ASN GW Relocation 
Algorithms 
There are two periods in 
non-predictive ASN GW relocation 
algorithm: detection period and 
relocation period. In detection period, 
the Dynamic Detection Interval (DDI) is 
used to dynamically adjust the time 
interval for detecting the load condition. 
There are two types of Detection 
Interval (DI), large DI (L−DI) and small 
DI (S−DI). The threshold, low DR 
(L−DR), is also defined. The criterion of 
DDI is defined as: If the latest DR < 
L−DR and WMADR < L−DR, DDI = 
L−DI; Otherwise, DDI = S−DI. In order 
to prevent the problem caused by 
instantaneous bursty traffic, we use the 
new DR records and Weighted Moving 
Average (WMA) [11] to calculate 
WMADR to present the load condition. 
The WMADR is defined as follows:  
)6(

1 KK
∑
∑
=
=
∗
∗∗
= n
i
ii
n
i
iii
DR
WDDI
DRWDDI
WMA  
where DDIi means the ith DDI, for 
all i = 1, 2, ...n. Wi represents the weight 
for DRi, for all i = 1, 2, ...n. The newest 
DR record has the highest weight. We 
also define two constraints, MAX−DRs 
and MIN−DRs. MAX−DRs represents 
the maximum of new DR records to be 
collected. Because the older DR records 
cannot represent the current load 
condition, the DR records which are too 
old can be discarded. MIN−DRs means 
the minimum of DR records. When ASN 
GW begins its detection period, the DR 
records need to be refreshed because the 
ASN GW relocation might be performed 
in relocation period, in which the traffic 
condition is different. The instantaneous 
bursty traffic has a great impact on the 
WMADR when there are only few DR 
records.  
 
Fig. 5  Non-predictive ASN GW Relocation 
Algorithm 
Thus, WMADR is calculated if n ≥ 
MIN−DRs and n ≤ MAX−DRs. 
Moreover, the threshold, high DR 
(H−DR), is defined. If WMADR is higher 
than H−DR, the ASN GW begins its 
relocation period. In the relocation 
period, the proposed MS relocation 
algorithm with binary exponential 
backoff is used to determine the number 
 12
2 . There are three traffic models, 
Constant Bit Rate (CBR), Exponential 
On/Off, and FTP, used in the simulation. 
Each ASN GW connects to a BS by a 10 
Mbps link. The MS first arrives at ASN 
GW A and initiates a connection with a 
Correspondent Node (CN). The MS will 
handoff to ASN GW B when its 
residence time expires. The routing path 
is then indicated by Flow (3) in Fig. 2. 
By deploying the proposed ASN GW 
relocation algorithms, the anchored MSs 
might be relocated and the routing path 
is indicated by Flow (4). Table I lists the 
parameters used in the simulation. 
Exponential distribution with mean 
20s~200s is used to model the 
inter-arrival time of MSs. The network 
residence time is exponentially 
distributed with mean 30s.  
z Experiment 1: Average Packet 
Drop Ratio 
 
Fig. 7 Average TCP packet delay vs. Mean 
inter-arrival time of MSs 
Fig. 7 demonstrates the average 
packet drop ratio versus the mean 
inter-arrival time of MSs for exponential 
On/Off traffic. As the mean inter-arrival 
time of MSs decreases, the load of ASN 
GW could be increased quickly. Thus, if 
ASN GW only uses the RED without 
MS relocation mechanism, the packet 
drop ratio would be always high as 
shown in Fig. 7. Besides, by deploying 
the predictive ASN GW relocation 
algorithm, the average packet drop ratio 
is lower than that of the non-predictive. 
Moreover, because the Wiener 
prediction is inherently sensitive to the 
variation of the successive DRs in 
Equation (7), the Wiener prediction has 
the lowest packet drop ratio. Although 
not shown here, CBR traffic is also used 
in our simulation. The results are similar 
to that in Fig. 7.  
z Experiment 2: Average TCP 
Throughput 
 
Fig. 8 Average TCP throughput vs. Mean 
inter-arrival time of MSs 
Fig. 8 illustrates the average TCP 
throughput versus the mean inter-arrival 
time of MSs. In simulation, one MS is 
designated to be always served by ASN 
GW A. This is because that the serving 
MS’s TCP throughput presents the 
serving rate of ASN GW A. While the 
mean inter-arrival time of MSs increases, 
the load of ASN GW increases slower. 
The serving MSs could get more 
bandwidth for the TCP transmissions as 
shown in RED without relocation in Fig. 
8. Furthermore, Fig. 8 shows that more 
bandwidth is provided to the serving MS 
when applying the proposed ASN GW 
relocation algorithms. This is because 
that the proposed algorithms can 
perform the MS relocation for the 
anchored MSs as the packet drop ratio is 
higher than the thresholds. Fig. 8 shows 
that Wiener prediction has the highest 
TCP throughput. This is because that the 
MS relocation technique is performed 
frequently due to the larger variation of 
the FTP traffic.
