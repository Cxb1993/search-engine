often can have adverse effects on the 
operational performance and accuracy.  The 
method of input shaping control has been 
successfully applied to minimize the residual 
vibration in flexible structures while 
accomplishing the desired task ( Singer & 
Seering, 1990; Singh & Heppler, 1993; Tzes 
& Yurkovich, 1993).  Input shaping is 
implemented by a sequence of impulses, 
called the input shaper, together with a 
desired system command, and yields the 
system input that results in the desired 
motion without vibration.  However, one 
drawback of this method is that the exact 
cancellation of the residual structural 
vibration depends on the amplitudes and 
instants of applied impulses which are related 
to system parameters.  If models have 
parametric uncertainties, system performance 
will not result in zero residual vibration.  
Furthermore, methods in the existing 
literature do not deal with vibration caused 
by state delays and external disturbances. 
Several design approaches have been 
proposed to improve the robustness of input 
shaping to uncertainties in the damping 
factors and natural frequencies of a flexible 
structure (Singhose, Derezinski, & Singer, 
1996; Pai & Sinha, 1996; Pao & Lau, 1999; 
Mao, Liu, & Li, 2002).  However, the price 
for increasing robustness is to lengthen the 
duration of the impulse sequence which 
results in a slower system response.  Also, 
the vibration caused by state delays and 
external disturbance has not been considered.  
Recently, in order to improve the robustness, 
a feedback controller combined with input 
shaping has received more attention.  A 
method of concurrently designing the input 
shaping and feedback control for 
insensitivity to parameter variations is 
developed by Kenison & Singhose (2000).  
An adaptive input shaper providing 
robustness to parameter uncertainties by 
tuning the shaper to the flexible mode 
frequencies is explored by Cutforth & Pao 
(2002).  However, they did not consider 
effects caused by inaccurate amplitudes or 
instants of impulses, state delays and external 
disturbances.  A scheme of increasing the 
robustness of shaper without adding more 
impulses to the shaper is presented by 
Dharne & Jayasuriya (2003).  The adaptive 
closed-loop controller is designed such that 
the step response of the designed model to 
the shaped input is tracked quite accurately.  
However, in this method, the input shaper is 
designed for the nominal system, instead of 
the design model which includes the nominal 
system and the controller.  Hence, in the 
preshaped impulse response of the designed 
model, the residual vibration after the 
application of the last impulse is not 
eliminated.  Furthermore, they did not 
consider the vibration caused by state delays 
and external disturbances.  Kapila et al. 
(2000) have developed a closed-loop input 
shaping control method for the robustness to 
inaccuracies in the instants of applied 
impulses.  However, they did not consider 
the ranges of parametric uncertainties, state 
delays and exogenous disturbances. 
The sliding mode control (SMC) theory 
(Utkin; 1977, 1978, 1983; Slotine & Li, 
1991) can produce the perfect trajectory 
tracking in the presence of parametric 
uncertainties and external disturbances 
whereas ∞H  method (Zhou et al., 1996) 
provides a direct algorithm for designing 
robust control systems.  Therefore, SMC 
and ∞H /µ  techniques have been combined 
in this paper to increase the robustness of the 
input shaping method.  Time-delay 
∞H control method (Kim & Park, 1999; Zribi 
& Mahmoud, 1999) has been used for 
uncertain systems with time-delays.

3.1 Problem formulation 
The proposed scheme is shown in Figure 
1.  An input shaper is implemented outside 
of the feedback loop, which is designed for 
the reference model and achieves the exact 
elimination of residual vibration.

error will approach to zero, i.e., 0)( →te  
⇒  0)( →tey  or )()( tyty m→ , then the 
closed-loop system will exactly eliminate the 
residual vibration like the reference model.  
Since SMC provides good ability to reject 
disturbances and remain robust to parameter 
perturbations while tracking a desired 
trajectory, it can be more useful for this 
purpose than other strategies in the literature. 
 
3.2 Sliding surface design  
The sliding surface is defined as

[ ]Tm BHB 20=  and the matrix 2B  is 
non-singular. 
Using (3) and (11), the system (8)-(9)

Neglecting the last two terms, Equation 
(13) can be considered as a new state 
equation, and the new inputs in the sliding

Therefore, the design of sliding 
hyperplanes involves finding an output 
feedback gain matrix sK  to stabilize the 
system (13) by LMI-based ∞H  method..  
El-khazali and Decarlo (1995) have shown 
that one may choose a desired sliding surface 
by letting sKG = . 
 
3.3 Stability in sliding mode  
In this section, the small gain theorem 
are used to evaluate the robustness of the 
system in the sliding mode surface in the 
presence of mismatched uncertain matrices 
−∆ 11A  and −∆ 12A .  In order to utilize the 
small gain theorem, neglecting the last terms, 
the subsystem with parametric uncertainties 
in (13) is transformed into the ss KN −∆−  
diagram (Fig. 2(a)) through the linear 
fractional transformation method (LFT) 
(Zhou et al., 1996), where { }ps diag δδ ,,1 ⋅⋅⋅=∆ .
