Preparation and characterization of SOFC cathodes made of 
SSC nanofibers 
Abstract 
Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-δ (SSC) nanowires with 50-150 nm diameters were successfully prepared by 
an electrospinning method. Subsequent calcination and ultrasonic vibration rendered short 
nanofibers with 20-100 nm diameters. Slurry containing SSC nanofibers were prepared and 
screen-printed on half cells to obtain NiO-SSC/CGO(Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95)/SSC single cells. AC 
impedance and polarization measurements were carried out with humidified H2 as fuel (100 
cm3 min−1 with 3% H2O) and dry O2 (50 cm
3 min−1) as oxidant. The results indicated that 
lowest area specific resistances were 0.204, 0.124, 0.078, 0.043 and 0.025 Ωcm2 at 500, 550, 
600, 650 and 700°C, respectively. The corresponding peak power values of the single cell 
were 0.18, 0.29, 0.47, 0.64 and 1.09 Wcm-2.

2. Experimental 
2.1 Electrospinning of SSC nanowires 
 The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.001 mole Sm(NO3)3•6H2O (Strem, 
99.9%), 0.001 mole Sr(NO3)2 (Showa, 98%), 0.002 mole Co(NO3)2•6H2O (Aldrich, 98%) , 
1.5 g PVP (Polyvinyl pyrrolidone, molecular weight: 1,300,000, Alfa Aesar) and 0.5 g P123 
(Pluronic, O-BASF) in a mixture solvent of 8 ml de-ionized water and 12 ml ethanol. P123 
served as surfactant, PVP as thickening agent and the total concentration of metal ions was 
0.2 M.  
 As shown in the schematic diagram of Fig. 1, the precursor solution was pumped by a 
syringe pump (KDS, KD-100) in a flow rate of 1 ml/h to the tip of a stainless needle (Trumo, 
No.17) where it was drawn into nanowires by an electrostatic field imposed between the 
needle and a copper plate on which a stainless steel gauze collector (80 mm × 80 mm) sat. 
 The electrostatic field was established by applying a high voltage of 12 kV (Acopian, 
PH030HA1) across the 7 cm gap between the needle and the copper plate. The needle was 
scanned over the collector via an x-y table with a speed of 3 mm/sec, and the collector was 
heated by a heater beneath the copper plate and kept at 100°C by the thermal couple and 
temperature controller connected to the copper plate during the electrospinning process.  
 After the electrospinning, the blanket of nanowires was removed from the stainless steel 
gauze collector and heated in a furnace at 500°C for 2 h to remove the organic content. The 
obtained nanowires were then calcined at 800°C for 2 h to promote crystallization. The 
calcined nanowires were fragmented in an ultrasonic vibrator for 15 min to form shorter 
nanofibers for cathode preparation.  
 
2.2 Fabrication of SSC/CGO/SSC symmetrical cells 
 Slurry of SSC nanofibers was screen-printed on both sides of CGO disks to prepare 
symmetrical cells for electrochemical measurement. The CGO disks of 15 mm diameter and 
5

Nanofiber SSC cathode was screen-printed on the half cell by the same processes used in 
symmetrical cell preparation. 
 
2.4 Characterization 
 Phase identification was carried out for the current nanowires, nanofibers, powder and 
cathodes using an x-ray powder diffractometer (Siemens D5000) with a Cu tube and a quartz 
monochromator on the diffracted beam side. A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Joel, 
JSM-6330) was used for observation of their morphologies. A transmission electron 
microscope (Joel AEM 3010) was also used to examine the morphology and phase of the 
prepared nanofibers. AC impedances of symmetrical and single cells were measured using a 
potentiostat/galvanostat (Autolab PGSTAT30) with an excitation voltage of 50 mV. The 
impedance spectra were recorded over the frequency range of 0.01-100 kHz in the 
temperature of 500-700C under ambient air and open circuit condition. Voltage vs. current 
curves of the single cell were also measured in the temperature of 500-700C with humidified 
H2 as fuel (100 cm
3 min−1 with 3% H2O) and dry O2 (50 cm
3 min−1) as oxidant.

 Fig. 10 shows the cross section view of the Ni-CGO/CGO/nanofiber SSC single cell 
prepared in this work. The voltage vs. current and power curves of the single cell under 
500-700°C are shown in Fig. 11(a) and the corresponding impedance spectra are shown in Fig. 
11(b). Peak power values under the operation temperatures of 500, 550, 600, 650 and 700°C 
were 0.18, 0.29, 0.47, 0.64 and 1.09 Wcm-2, respectively.
