2.1 交錯式三階PWM轉換器 
2.1.1 系統架構 
為了改善全橋電路在高壓應用時，造成開
關電壓應力過高的缺點，所以提出新型交錯
式三階零電壓直流轉換器電路。如圖1所示，
本電路由模組一與模組二所構成，電路中每
一個開關的最大導通時間(ton)為二分之一週
期，也就是最大180度，此時將交錯式技術加
入到電路中，模組一與模組二的電路操作週
期間差180度，如此恰可使兩模組的電路操作
狀態完全相反，所以模組一與模組二的變壓
器二次側輸出端電感電流漣波一個上升，另
一個下降，所以輸出電感電流漣波會互相抵
消，使電路的輸出電流更平穩，並縮小輸出
濾波器的體積。本電路架構的最大優點是開
關S1、S2、S5與S6的耐壓僅需輸入電壓的一
半，且當開關的耐壓越低，則其導通電阻也
越低，且高壓的開關元件價格偏高又不易獲
得，所以可減少開關的價格成本與提升電路
效率。電路架構預計輸入電壓為400伏，輸出
電壓12伏，輸出電流84安培，輸出功率1000
瓦，為了提供輸出端的大電流，變壓器二次
側採用倍流整流的方式，其優點在於變壓器
二次側線圈、輸出濾波電感與二次側二極體
的電流額定只需要四分之一的總輸出電流，
因此可大幅降低輸出濾波器的體積與成本。
由於三階電路的操作，變壓器一次側電壓具
有三個電壓準位，分別為Vin-vCc、Vin/2-vCc
與-vCc。為了達到高效率節省能源的目標，功
率開關S1~S6均操作於零電壓導通，效率約可
達92%，並且使用商用IC來設計控制電路操

Abstract - This research project presents the theoretical 
analysis, design consideration and implementation of 
new interleaved ZVS converters. The proposed 
converters can be used in high power applications. Based 
on the interleaved PWM scheme, the input and output 
current ripples can be partially cancelled so that the input 
and output chokes and capacitors are reduced. The power 
switches are turned on at zero voltage switching (ZVS). 
Thus, the voltage stresses and limited and switching 
losses are reduced. In this project, the circuit analysis of 
the proposed converter operating in CCM will be 
presented, and the mathematical models of the 
interleaved ZVS converters are established. Finally, the 
experimental results based on the laboratory prototype 
are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed 
interleaved ZVS converters.

Abstract: This study presents a reduced switch dual-converter to implement the features of zero-voltage
switching (ZVS), load current sharing, high output current and low output ripple current. There are two
converter modules in the proposed converter. These two modules share the same power switches and provide
the balance load current. The active-clamping circuit is used to realise the ZVS turn-on such that the switching
losses on power switches are reduced. The current output rectiﬁer is adopted in the output side to realise the
higher output current with reduced ripple current such that the sizes of the output chokes and capacitor are
reduced. Compared with the conventional ZVS parallel-connected converter with four power switches, only
two switches are used in the proposed converter to accomplish parallel operation. Thus, the proposed
converter has less circuit components. Finally, the experimental results based on a laboratory prototype
(12 V/50 A) are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed converter.
1 Introduction
Forward converters with pulse-width modulation (PWM)
scheme have been widely used in low-power applications
for its relatively simplicity. The magnetic ﬂux of power
transformer must be reset before the next switching cycle in
forward converters. The third demagnetising winding
approach or passive snubber is generally used to reset the
transformer magnetic ﬂux. However, the converters are
operated with hard switching PWM such that the power
switch has high switching losses. Resonant forward
converters [1] have been presented to reduce switching
losses and increase the system efﬁciency. Although the
switch can be turned on at zero-voltage switching (ZVS) or
turned off at zero-current switching (ZCS), the drawback
of the resonant forward converter is the high voltage or
current stresses on power semiconductors especially for
high input voltage or current applications. The active clamp
forward converters [2–6] have been proposed to achieve
transformer ﬂux reset and reduce voltage stress on power
switch when power switch is turned off. The ZVS feature
of power switch can be achieved by the resonant behaviour
during the transition interval. The interleaved forward
converters [7–10] have been proposed to reduce the size of
the magnetising components and lower power losses and
thermal stresses on power converters. The interleaved
PWM technique is a paralleling technique with a phase
shift over a switching period to reduce the ripple current on
the output side. The current doubler rectiﬁer techniques [9,
10] have the advantages of low current rating of the
secondary winding of transformer and ripple current
cancellation at the output side. Two main switches are
required to separately control the output currents in the
interleaved converter. The other two auxiliary switches are
required additional to realise the ZVS turn-on. Therefore
four power switches are required in the interleaved ZVS
converters [10].
A soft-switching dual converter is presented to achieve the
features of ZVS turn-on, low-voltage stress of clamp
capacitor and less ripple current on the output side. Two
converter modules are operated to realise parallel operation
and share the load current. Two converter modules share
the same power switches such that the proposed converter
has less switch count compared with the conventional
interleaved forward converter with four switches. Each
converter module includes one main switch, one isolated
transformer, one active clamp circuit and one current
doubler rectiﬁer. Active clamp circuit is used to achieve
ZVS turn-on for both switches during the transition

achieve ripple current cancellation. Thus, the output chokes
and output capacitor can be reduced.
2.2 Principle of operation
The key waveforms in steady-state are shown in Fig. 3. In
Fig. 3, the waveform of ism includes the currents through
resonant capacitor Cr and anti-parallel diode of Sm. The
operation principle of the proposed converter can be
described by eight operating modes during one switching
cycle as shown in Fig. 4. For the description of circuit
operation, the following assumptions are made:
† circuit components are considered ideal;
† output capacitor Co is large enough to consider as a
constant voltage;
† clamp capacitances C1 and Cc are identical, C1 ¼ Cc≫ Cr;
† clamp voltages vC1 and vCc are constant during one
switching cycle;
† the capacitor voltage vC1 ¼ Vin in steady-state;
† turns ratio of two transformers between the primary
winding and secondary winding are identical, n1 ¼ n2 ; n;
† transformers T1 and T2 are identical,
Lm,T1 ¼ Lm,T2 ; Lm;
† resonant inductances are identical, Lr1 ¼ Lr2 ; Lr and
Lm≫ Lr;
† output inductances L11–L22 are identical,
L11 ¼ L12 ¼ L21 ¼ L22 ; Lo;
† energy stored in the resonant inductances Lr1 and Lr2 is
greater than energy stored in the resonant capacitance Cr to
achieve ZVS of Sm and Sa.
In the following, the circuit analysis and operational
principle of the proposed converter for each mode are
described. Before time t0, switch Sm and diodes D11–D22
are conducting.
Mode 1 (t0 ≤ t , t1): During this mode, switches Sm and Sa
are in the on-state and off-state, respectively. For module 1,
the power is transferred to output load through Vin, Lr1, T1,
Sm, D12, L11 and Co. The voltage across the inductor Lr1 and
primary winding of T1 is Vin. Thus, the inductor current iLr1
and the output inductor current iL11 increase. The output
inductor current iL12 decreases. Diode D11 is in the off-
state. For circuit module 2, the voltage across inductor Lr2
and primary winding of T2 equals vC1. The inductor
current iLr2 increases. The energy stored in C1 is
transferred to output load through Lr2, T2, Sm, D21, L22
and Co. The rectiﬁer diode D22 is in the off-state. The
output inductor currents iL21 and iL22 are decreasing and
increasing, respectively. The inductor currents iLr1 and iLr2
are expressed as

Mode 2 (t1 ≤ t , t2): This mode starts at time t1 when main
switch Sm is turned off. At time t1, the switch current iSm is
positive. Thus, the switch current iSm charges capacitor Cr
from zero voltage to Vin. The components Cr, Lr1, Lr2
and the magnetising inductors of T1 and T2 are resonant

capacitor voltage vCr are approximately expressed as

where Z1 ¼ p(Lm+ Lr)/(2Cr), v1 ¼ p2/[Cr(Lm+ Lr)],

ends at time t2 when capacitor voltage vCr(t2) ¼
Vin ¼ vC1. At this instant, the primary voltages of
transformers T1 and T2 are equal to zero. Thus, the
diodes D11–D22 are all conducting after time t2. The time

Mode 3 (t2 ≤ t , t3): At time t2, capacitor voltage
vCr ¼ Vin ¼ vC1 such that the primary voltages of T1 and
T2 are equal to zero. Thus, the diodes D11–D22 at the
secondary sides are all in the on-state. The diode currents
iD12 and iD21 decrease, whereas the diode currents iD11
and iD22 increase. Capacitor Cr is continuously charged
from vC1 to vCc+ vC1. The components Lr1, Lr2 and Cr
are resonant in this mode. The inductor currents, iLr1 and
iLr2, and capacitor voltage vCr are expressed as
vCr = vC1 + (iLr1(t2)+ iLr2(t2))Z2 sin v2(t − t2) (8)

Mode 4 (t3 ≤ t , t4): This mode starts at time t3 when
capacitor voltage vCr(t3) ¼ vCc+ vC1 and the anti-parallel
diode of auxiliary switch Sa is conducting. The diodes
D11–D22 are still in the commutation mode. The
inductor voltages vLr1 ¼ vLr2 ¼ 2vCc such that the
inductor currents iLr1 and iLr2 decrease with the slope of
2vCc/Lr. Before switch current iSa is positive, auxiliary
switch Sa must be turned on to achieve ZVS operation.
Mode 5 (t4 ≤ t , t5): This mode starts at time t4 when the
diode currents iD12 and iD21 decrease to zero. In the circuit
module 1, the voltage across the inductor Lr1 and the
magnetising inductor of T1 approximates Vin2 vCc2 vC1.
Since Vin2 vCc2 vC1 , 0, the inductor current iLr1
decreases. The secondary winding voltage of T1 is negative
such that the rectiﬁer diodes D11 and D12 are in the
on-state and off-state, respectively. The output inductor
current iL11 decreases and iL12 increases. In circuit module
2, the voltage across the inductor Lr2 and the magnetising
inductor of T2 approximates 2vCc. Thus, the rectiﬁer
diodes D21 and D22 are in the off-state and on-state,
respectively. Power is transferred from the clamp capacitor
Cc to output load through Lr2, T2, Sa, D22, L21 and Co.
The output inductor current iL21 increases and iL22 decreases.
Mode 6 (t5 ≤ t , t6): This mode starts at time t5 when
auxiliary switch Sa is turned off. Since iLr1+ iLr2 is negative
at time t5, the capacitor Cr is discharged from vCc+ vC1 to
vC1. The components Lr1, Lr2, Cr and the magnetising
inductors of T1 and T2 are resonant in this mode. The
inductor currents iLr1 and iLr2 and capacitor voltage vCr are
approximately expressed as
vCr = vC1(1− cos v1(t − t5))+ (vCc + vC1) cos v1(t − t5)

At time t6, the capacitor voltage vCr ¼ vC1 ¼ Vin. At this
instant, the primary and secondary voltages of transformers
T1 and T2 are all zero. Thus, the diodes D11–D22 are all
conducting after time t6. The time interval of this mode is

From (23) and (24), we can obtain the capacitor voltages vC1
and vCc.
vC1=Vin, vCc= dVin/(1−d ) (25)
From (25), we can see that the average capacitor voltage vC1
equals input source voltage, and the capacitor voltage vCc
depends on the duty-cycle d and the input voltage Vin. The
capacitor voltage vCc is greater than input voltage Vin when
the duty-cycle d . 0.5. On the other hand, vCc , Vin if
d , 0.5. Based on the voltage-second balance on output
inductors L11–L22, the following equations can be obtained.

(vC1/n−Vo)(d−dloss)T −Vo(1−d+dloss)T =0 (29)
From (26)–(29), the voltage conversion ratio M of the
proposed converter is expressed as
M= Vo

(30)
where deff is the effective duty-cycle of main switch Sm. If
the maximum duty loss dloss,max≪ dmin, then the voltage
conversion ratio M ≃ d/n.
3 Design considerations
3.1 Selection of turns ratio
If deff,max is the maximum effective duty-cycle of Sm, the
turns ratio of transformers T1 and T2 is given as
n = deff , maxVin,min
Vo + VF
(31)
where Vin,min is the minimum input voltage and VF is the
forward voltage drop on the rectiﬁer diode. The primary
winding turn Np of T1 and T2 can be expressed as
Np = vin,mindeff , max/(AeDBf ) (32)
where DB is working ﬂux density, Ae is the effective cross-
section area of the selected transformer cores and f is the
switching frequency. Then, the secondary winding turn
Ns ¼ Np/n of transformers T1 and T2 can be obtained from
(31) and (32).
3.2 Voltage and current stresses of
main and auxiliary switches
Based on the circuit conﬁguration, the voltage stresses of Sm
and Sa are expressed as
vSm,stress=vSa,stress=vCc+vC1=
d
1−dVin+Vin=
Vin
1−d (33)
From (33), the voltage stresses of main switch Sm and
auxiliary switch Sa are related to the input voltage Vin and
the duty-cycle d. In steady-state, the average current at the
secondary side of T1 is zero and the sum of the average
output inductor currents iL11 and iL12 equal io/2. Thus, the
average output inductor currents in module 1 are given as
iL11= (1−d)io/2, iL12=dio/2 (34)
In the same way, the average output inductor currents in
module 2 are expressed as
iL21=dio/2, iL22= (1−d)io/2 (35)
The peak currents of switches Sm and Sa approximate the peak
value of (iLr1+ iLr2). When Sm is turned on in mode 1, the
switch current iSm≃ iL11/n+ iLm,T1+ iL22/n+ iLm,T2, where
iLm,T1 and iLm,T2 are the average magnetising inductor
currents of T1 and T2, respectively. When Sa is turned on in
mode 5, the average current iSa is zero due to the current-
second balance on the capacitor Cc. Thus, we can obtain (36).
iLm,T1− iL12/n+ iLm,T2− iL21/n=0 (36)
Based on the current-second on the capacitor C1, we can
obtain (37).
(iLm,T1− iL12/n)(1−d)−(iLm,T2+ iL22/n)d=0 (37)
From (34)–(37), we can derive the average magnetising
currents.
iLm,T1=
dio
n
, iLm,T2=0 (38)
From (38), the peak switch current of Sm can be further
expressed as iSm,peak ≃ io/n. If the ripple currents in the
magnetising inductors of T1 and T2 cannot be ignored, the
peak currents of Sm and Sa are expressed as
iSm,peak= iSa,peak≃

cycle d ¼ 0.5. If we select the inductor current ripple

and switch currents iSm and iSa at the light load (io ¼ 3 A)
and full load (io ¼ 50 A) are shown in Fig. 7. When main
switch Sm is turned on, the inductor currents iLr1 and iLr2
increase, and switch currents iSm ¼ iLr1+ iLr2 and iSa ¼ 0.
When Sm is turned off and Sa is turned on, the inductor
currents iLr1 and iLr2 decrease, and switch currents
iSa ¼ 2iLr12 iLr2 and iSm ¼ 0. Fig. 8 gives the measured
waveforms of the transformer secondary side currents of
converter module 1 for full load (io ¼ 50 A) condition. In
the same way, the measured waveforms of iD22, iL21, iL22
and iL21+ iL22 of converter module 2 for full load
(io ¼ 50 A) are given in Fig. 9. When Sm is turned on, the
diode current iD12 equals iL11+ iL12 and the diode current
iD11 equals 0 for converter module 1. For converter module
2, the diode current iD21 equals iL21+ iL22 and the diode

condition. Fig. 10 gives the measured output voltage and
load current under the load variation between io ¼ 30 A
and io ¼ 50 A. From the measured results, the output
voltage of the proposed converter is less sensitive to the
load variations. The maximum efﬁciency of the adopted
converter based on the power metre measurement is 91.2%.
5 Conclusion
This paper presents a soft-switching dual-converter with
reduced switch to achieve ZVS turn-on of all switches.
With the buck-boost type of active-clamping circuit, the
transformer ﬂux can be reset and the voltage stresses on the
switches are limited. Two converter modules are operated to
share the load current. The current doubler rectiﬁer is
adopted in the output side to reduce ripple current in the
output capacitor such that the sizes of the output chokes
and capacitor are reduced. The ZVS turn-on of switches is
achieved at the transition interval and the switching losses
on power semiconductors are reduced. In this paper, the
circuit conﬁguration, operation principle, steady-state analysis
and design example are discussed in detail. The future
studies of the proposed converter are the dynamic response,
small signal analysis for stability and current balance
problem. Finally, the experimental results based on a
laboratory prototype with 12 V/50 A output are provided to
verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed converter.

Abstract: The system analysis, circuit implementation and design consideration of interleaved bi-ﬂyback converter
with zero voltage switching (ZVS) are presented.To reduce the ripple current on the input and output capacitors and
decrease the current stress on the transformer secondary windings, two modules with interleaved pulse-width
modulation (PWM) are connected in parallel at the input and output sides. Thus, the transformer copper losses
and the conduction losses on the output diodes are reduced. Active snubber is connected in parallel with the
main switch to limit the voltage spike because of the transformer leakage inductance when main switch is
turned off. All power switches are turned on at ZVS during the commutation stage. Thus, the switching losses
and thermal stresses of the semiconductors are reduced. Finally, experiments based on a 720 W (24 V/30 A)
prototype are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed converter.
1 Introduction
Switching converters based on ﬂyback converters have been
used in low-power applications because of its less components
and simplicity. The transformer in ﬂyback converters can
achieve electric isolation and energy storage. However, the
drawback of ﬂyback converters is hard switching operation
resulted in low efﬁciency, high switching losses and high
voltage and current stresses on the power semiconductors.
The low-cost passive snubber can reduce the energy stored in
the leakage inductance and limit the voltage stress on power
switch. However, the converter efﬁciency is not greatly
improved. The soft switching ﬂyback converters with the
quasi-resonant techniques [1, 2] have been proposed to
reduce the switching losses on power switch. However, the
voltage stress on power switch is not improved. Active-
clamping ﬂyback converters have been proposed in [3–8] to
limit the voltage stress of the switch. Power switches are
turned on at the zero voltage switching (ZVS) during the
transition interval. Parallel converters have been proposed for
medium power applications such as computer servers and
telecommunication power supplies. The parallel operation can
smooth some of the constraints of the individual switching
converter module. By using interleaving techniques [9–13]
with phase shifting of the pulse-width modulation (PWM)
signals of several converter modules, the currents through the
switches are just fractions of the input current and the current
ripple on the output capacitor is reduced. Therefore the size
of the output capacitor is reduced.
This paper presents an interleaved ZVS bi-ﬂyback
converter. There are two converter modules in the adopted
circuit. Each converter module has two ﬂyback cells to share
the load current and reduce the current stresses output
diodes. Based on the active-clamping circuit, power switches
are all turned on at ZVS during the commutation stage. The
voltage stresses on switches are also limited by the clamp
capacitor voltage. Two converter modules are operated with
the interleaved PWM technique such that the current
ripples on input and output capacitors are reduced. Thus,
the size and weight of the output capacitor are reduced. The
circuit conﬁguration, mathematical analysis and design
consideration are presented in detail. Finally, experiments
based on a laboratory prototype with 720 W (24 V/30 A)
rated power are presented to verify the circuit performance.
2 Circuit conﬁguration

converter. Two converter modules are connected in parallel
to share the load current. In each converter module, two

Vin in steady state, (iii) capacitances of C1–C4 are much larger
than the capacitance of Cr1 and Cr2 (Cr1 ¼ Cr2 ¼ Cr), (iv) the
resonant inductances Lr1 ¼ Lr2 ¼ Lr3 ¼ Lr4 ; Lr are less
than the magnetising inductances Lm,T1 ¼ Lm,T2 ¼ Lm,T3 ¼
Lm,T4 ; Lm, (v) the turn ratio of transformers T1–T4,
n1 ¼ n2 ¼ n3 ¼ n4 ; n ¼ Np/Ns and (vi) the energy stored
in the resonant inductances Lr1–Lr4 is greater than energy
stored in the resonant capacitance Cr1 and Cr2 to achieve
ZVS turn-on for all switches. Referring to the equivalent
circuits shown in Fig. 3, the operation principles in one
switching cycle are described as follows. Prior to t0, switches
Sa1 and Sa2 are on and the rectiﬁer diodes D1–D4 are
conducting.
Mode 1 (t0 , t , t1): At time t0, the auxiliary switch Sa1 is
turned off in converter module 1. Since iLr1(t0)2 iLr2(t0) is
negative, the capacitor Cr1 is discharged by current
iSm1 ¼ iLr12 iLr2. The rectiﬁer diodes D1 and D2 are still
conducting. We can obtain the magnetising voltages
vLm,T1 ¼ 2nVo and vLm,T2 ¼ nVo. The magnetising
current iLm,T1 decreases and the magnetising current iLm,T2
increases in this mode. The capacitor voltage vCr1 in this
mode is given by
vCr(t) ’ vC1 þ
iLr1(t0) iLr2(t0)
Cr
(t  t0) (1)
The inductor currents iLr1 and iLr2 are almost constant in this
mode. In converter module 2, switch Sa2 is on and diodes D3
and D4 are conducting. The magnetising voltages
vLm,T3 ¼ 2nVo and vLm,T4 ¼ nVo. The magnetising
current iLm,T3 decreases and the magnetising current iLm,T4
increases in this mode. The inductor current iLr3 decreases
and the iLr4 increases

iL4(t) ’ iL4(t0)þ
vC3  nVo  vC4
Lr
(t  t0) (3)
The power stored in transformers T1–T4 is delivered to the
output load through D1–D4. This mode ends at time t1
when vCr1 ¼ 0. At this instant, the anti-parallel diode of
main switch Sm1 is conducting.
Mode 2 (t1  t , t2): After time t1, the voltage vCr1 ¼ 0 and
the anti-parallel diode of Sm1 is conducting. Before iSm1 is
positive, switch Sm1 must be turned on to realise the ZVS
feature. In this mode, the rectiﬁer diodes D1 and D2 are still
conducting. Thus, the magnetising voltages vLm,T1 ¼ 2nVo
and vLm,T2 ¼ nVo. The inductor voltages vLr1 ¼ Vinþ nVo
and vLr2 ¼ 2vC22 nVo. Thus the inductor current iLr1
increases and iLr2 decreases. In circuit module 2, the
operation principle in this mode is the same as the operation
principle in mode 1. The power stored in transformers
T1–T4 is delivered to the output load through D1–D4.
This mode ends at time t2 when diode currents iD1 and iD2
are decreasing to zero.
Mode 3 (t2  t , t3): In this mode, main switch Sm1 is on
and diodes D1 and D2 are off for converter module 1. The
voltage across the inductor Lr1 and primary winding of T1
equal Vin and the inductor current iLr1 increases linearly
with the slope of Vin/(Lrþ Lm). The voltage across
inductor Lr2 and primary winding of T2 equal 2vC2 and
the inductor current iLr2 decreases linearly with the slope of
2vC2/(Lrþ Lm). The input power is stored in the
magnetising inductances of T1 and T2. The power stored
in transformers T3 and T4 is delivered to the output load
through D3 and D4. This mode ends at time t3 when main
switch Sm1 is turned off.
Mode 4 (t3  t , t4): This mode starts at time t3 when main
switch Sm1 is turned off. Since the switch current iSm1 is
positive, capacitor Cr1 is charged from 0 V to VC1. Diodes
D1 and D2 are in the off-state. Since C1Cr1, the
capacitor voltage vCr1 is expressed as
vCr1(t) ’
iLr1(t3) iLr2(t3)
Cr
(t  t3) (4)
The inductor currents iLr1 and iLr2 are almost constant in this
mode. This mode ends at time t4 when capacitor voltage
vCr1 ¼ vC1.
Mode 5 (t4  t , t5): This mode starts at time t4 when
capacitor voltage vCr1 ¼ vC1. Then, the anti-parallel diode
of Sa1 is conducting. The rectiﬁer diodes D1 and D2 are
conducting. The magnetiszing voltages vLm,T1 ¼ 2nvo and
vLm,T2 ¼ nvo. To ensure ZVS turn-on, the auxiliary switch
Sa1 should be turned on before switch current iSa1 is
positive. The energy stored in the magnetising inductors
Lm,T1 and Lm,T2 is delivered to output load. The
magnetising current iLm,T1 decreases linearly with the slope
of 2nVo/Lm and the magnetising current iLm,T2 increases
linearly with the slope of nVo/Lm. The inductor current
iLr1 decreases and iLr2 increases. The rectiﬁer diode
currents iD1 and iD2 are given by
iD1(t) ¼ n(iLm,T1(t) iLr1(t)) (5)
iD2(t) ¼ n(iLr2(t) iLm,T2(t)) (6)
This mode ends at time t5 when the auxiliary switch Sa2 is
turned off.
Mode 6 (t5 , t , t6): At time t5, the auxiliary switch Sa2 is
turned off in converter module 2. Since iLr3(t5)2 iLr4(t5) is
negative, Cr2 is discharged by current iSm2 ¼ iLr32 iLr4. D3
and D4 are still conducting. The magnetising voltages
vLm,T3 ¼ 2nVo and vLm,T4 ¼ nVo such that the magnetising
current iLm,T3 decreases and iLm,T4 increases. The capacitor
voltage vCr2 approximately increases. In converter module 1,
Sa1, D1 and D2 are conducting. The transformer magnetising

inductor voltages vLm,T1 ¼ 2nVo and vLm,T2 ¼ nVo and the
inductor current iLr1 decreases and iLr2 increases. The power
stored in transformers T1–T4 is delivered to the output load
through D1–D4. This mode ends at time t6 when vCr2 ¼ 0.
At this instant, the anti-parallel diode of main switch Sm2 is
conducting.
Mode 7 (t6  t , t7): After time t6, the voltage vCr2 ¼ 0 and
the anti-parallel diode of Sm2 is conducting. Before iSm2 is
positive, Sm2 must be turned on to realise the ZVS. In this
mode, D3 and D4 are still conducting. Thus, the
magnetising voltages vLm,T3 ¼ 2nVo and vLm,T4 ¼ nVo.
The inductor voltages vLr3 ¼ Vinþ nVo and vLr4 ¼
2vC42 nVo. Therefore the inductor current iLr3 increases
and iLr4 decreases during this interval. This mode ends
at time t7 when diode currents iD3 and iD4 are decreasing
to zero.
Mode 8 (t7  t , t8): In this mode, Sm2 is on and diodes D3
and D4 are off. The voltage across the inductor Lr3 and
primary winding of T3 equal Vin and the inductor current
iLr3 increases linearly with the slope of Vin/(Lrþ Lm). The
voltage across inductor Lr4 and primary winding of T4
equal 2vC4 and the inductor current iLr4 decreases linearly
with the slope of 2vC4/(Lrþ Lm). The input power is
stored in the magnetising inductances of T3 and T4 in
converter module 2. The power stored in transformers T1
and T2 is delivered to the output load through D1 and D2.
This mode ends at time t8 when Sm2 is turned off.
Mode 9 (t8  t , Tþ t9): This mode starts at time t8 when
Sm2 is turned off. Since the switch current iSm2 is positive,
capacitor Cr2 is charged from 0 V to VC3. The diodes D3
and D4 are still in the off-state. Since C3Cr2, the
capacitor voltage vCr2 is expressed as
vCr2(t) ’
iLr3(t8) iLr4(t8)
Cr
(t  t8) (7)
This mode ends at time t9 when capacitor voltage
vCr2 ¼ vC3. Then the anti-parallel diode of Sa2 is conducting.
Mode 10 (t9  t , Tþ t0): This mode starts at time t9 when
capacitor voltage vCr2 ¼ vC3. Then, the anti-parallel diode of
Sa2 is conducting. The rectiﬁer diodes D3 and D4 are
conducting. The magnetising voltages vLm,T3 ¼ 2nvo and
vLm,T4 ¼ nvo. To ensure ZVS turn-on, Sa2 must be turned
on before iSa2 is positive. The magnetising current iLm,T3
decreases linearly with the slope of 2nVo/Lm and the
magnetising current iLm,T4 increases linearly with the slope
of nVo/Lm. The inductor current iLr3 decreases and iLr4
increases. This mode ends at time Tþ t0 when the
auxiliary switch Sa1 is turned off.
We assumed that the transition and delay times in modes
1, 4, 6 and 9 are very fast. Therefore these modes are
neglected to derive the voltage conversion ratio of the
adopted converter. Based on the voltage-second balance
across the inductor Lr1 and the magnetising inductor of T1,
the capacitor voltage vC1 can be obtained as
VC1 ¼
Vin
1 d (8)
where VC1 is the average value of capacitor C1 in a switching
cycle and Vin is the input voltage. Based on the voltage-
second balance across the inductor Lr2 and the magnetising
inductor of T2, the capacitor voltage vC2 can be obtained as
VC2 ¼ Vin (9)
where VC2 is the average value of capacitor C2 in a switching
cycle. In the same manner, the capacitor voltages VC3 and VC4
are given by
VC3 ¼

and the inductor current iLr2 increases. In the same manner,
the measured gate voltage, inductor currents and switch
currents in converter module 2 at the light (10%) and full
(100%) loads are given in Fig. 8. From the measured
results shown in Figs. 7 and 8, we can observe that the
input currents iLr1 and iLr3 from the input voltage source
are phase shifted one-half of switching period. Thus the
ripple current of the resultant input current iLr1þ iLr3 is
reduced.
Fig. 9a shows the measured waveforms of iD1, iD2, iD3 and
iD4 at full load. When Sm1 is turned on, the rectiﬁer diodes
D1 and D2 are turned off. Thus the diode currents iD1 and
iD2 are zero. When Sm1 is turned off, the rectiﬁer diodes
D1 and D2 are conducting. In the same manner, the diodes
D3 and D4 are conducting when Sm2 is tuned off. The
diodes currents iD1 and iD2 in converter module 1 are
phase shifted with the diode currents iD3 and iD4 in
converter module 2. Fig. 9b shows the measured gate
voltage vSm1,gs, output current iD1þ iD2 from module 1,
output current iD3þ iD4 from module 2 and the resultant
output current iD1þ iD2þ iD3þ iD4 before the output ﬁlter
capacitor Co at full load. We can observe that the output
currents from two converter modules are almost balanced.
The resultant current ripple on the output capacitor is
reduced. The type II voltage controller with TL431 is used
to achieve output voltage regulation. Fig. 10 shows the
measured output voltage Vo and load current io under the
load variation between the half (50%) and full (100%)

variations. Fig. 11 gives the measured circuit efﬁciencies

output power is 88.7%.

Abstract--An interleaved pulse-width modulation (PWM) 
zero voltage switching (ZVS) converter is presented in this 
paper. Two converter modules with interleaved PWM 
scheme are used in the proposed circuit to achieve load 
current sharing and reduce the ripple currents on the input 
and output capacitors such that the size of the output choke 
and capacitor are reduced. For each module, two buck-type 
dc-dc converters with only two switches are used to reduce 
the current rating of transformer winding and share the 
load current. Two buck-type converters in each module use 
the same switching devices to regulate the output voltage. 
The ZVS turn-on of the switches is achieved by utilizing the 
transformer leakage inductance and output capacitance of 
switches. Thus the switching losses of the proposed 
converter are reduced. Experiments based on a 660W 
prototype are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and 
the effectiveness of the proposed converter. 
Index Terms—Active clamp, ZVS, Buck-type converter, 
interleaved PWM. 
I.  INTRODUCTION
Forward converter has been used widely in many 
power supply systems with its well-regarded features 
such as smooth output current on the output side and 
simple circuit configuration. However, the part of 
transformer utilization and magnetic flux reset circuit are 
the main drawback of forward converter. Soft switching 
converters with high efficiency and high power density 
have been presented for distribution power system in 
telecommunication applications. Phase-shift pulse-width 
modulation (PWM) [1-2] has been presented for medium 
and high power applications with zero voltage switching 
(ZVS) turn-on. However, the cost of the phase-shift 
PWM converters is expensive and the ZVS turn-on of 
switches at light load is not easy to implement. The 
asymmetrical PWM half-bridge converters [3-4] have 
been proposed to achieve ZVS turn-on during the 
commutation stage of a pair of complementary switches. 
However, the voltage and current stresses of power 
switches in the transformer primary side and rectifier 
diodes at the transformer secondary side are related to the 
duty cycle. Active-clamping techniques [5-8] were 
proposed to achieve magnetic flux reset, absorb the surge 
energy stored in the leakage and magnetizing inductances, 
and limit the voltage stresses on power switches. Thus the 
voltage stresses on switches are reduced compared with 
                                                          
This project is partially supported by the National Science Council 
of Taiwan under Grant NSC 97-2221-E-224-064-MY2 and NSC 98-
2221-E-018-019. 
the voltage stresses in the conventional forward converter 
with RCD (resistor-capacitor-diode) snubber. For 
medium or high power applications, the parallel 
techniques with two or more converter modules can 
distribute the current stresses and power losses in each 
module. The parallel forward converters with ZVS 
technique have been presented in [9-13] for high output 
current applications. However, the control schemes of 
these converters are complex. The interleaved PWM 
technique is a paralleling technique with a phase shift 
over a switching period. The interleaved PWM technique 
not only can reduce the current stresses in each converter 
module but also decrease the ripple currents on input and 
output capacitors. Thus the size of the magnetizing 
components, power losses and thermal stresses on power 
converters can be reduced.  
An interleaved soft switching converter with ZVS 
turn-on is presented. The proposed converter includes 
two modules to achieve load current sharing and ripple 
current reduction using interleaved PWM scheme. Each 
module combines two buck-type converters. These two 
buck-type converters are connected in parallel at the input 
and output sides to further share load current and reduce 
the ripple current on the output capacitor. Two buck-type 
converters in each module share the same power switches 
such that the proposed converter has less switch-count 
compared with the conventional interleaved forward 
converter with four switches. One active-clamping circuit 
is used in each module to achieve magnetic flux reset and 
limit the voltage spike on power switches. During the 
commutation stage of two switches, the resonant 
inductance and the output capacitance of switches are 
resonant such that the power switches can be turned on at 
ZVS. Experimental results based on a 660W (12V/55A) 
prototype circuit are presented to verify the circuit 
performance. 
II.  CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION
Fig. 1(a) shows the circuit configuration of the 
proposed active-clamping converter. Two buck-type 
converters are connected in parallel in this circuit. The 
converter 1 includes the circuit components of Vin, Lr1, T1,
S1, Cr, D1 and Lo. The converter 2 includes C2, Lr2, T2, S1,
Cr, D2 and Lo. Vin and Vo are input and output voltages, 
respectively. Co is the output capacitor. C1 and S2 are 
clamp capacitor and auxiliary switch. Cr equals the 
parallel combination of the output capacitances of main 
switch S1 and auxiliary switch S2. Lr1, Lr2 and Cr are 
resonant during the transition interval such that power

Mode 8 [t7t<T/2+t0]: After time t7, the capacitor voltage 
vCr2=0 and the anti-parallel diode of S3 is conducting. 
Thus switch S3 can be turned on at ZVS before iS3 is 
positive. In this mode, diodes D3 and D4 are still in the 
commutation interval. The inductor voltages vLr3=Vin and 
vLr4=vC2. Thus the inductor currents iLr3 and iLr4 both 
increase and the output inductor current iLo2 decreases. 
This mode ends at time T/2+t0 when iD4 decreases to zero 
value. Then, the first half of circuit operation is 
completed. The second half of circuit operation in 
converter module 2 is symmetrical to the first half of 
circuit operation in converter module 1. 
IV.  CIRCUIT CHARACTERISTICS
The transition intervals in modes 2 and 3 for converter 
module 1 and modes 6 and 7 in converter module 2 are 
much shorter. Thus those modes can be neglected to 
derive the voltage conversion ratio of the proposed 
converter. Based on the voltage-second balance on the 
primary side of T1 and T2 in converter 1, the following 
equations can be obtained. 
δVin+(1-δ)(Vin-VC1-VC2)=0,  δVC2-(1-δ)VC1=0  (14) 
where VC1 and VC2 are the average voltages on capacitors 
C1 and C2 respectively in a switching cycle. From (14), 
the average capacitor voltages VC1 and VC2 can be 
rewritten as: 
VC1=δVin/(1-δ), VC2=Vin          (15) 
On the same manner, the average capacitor voltages VC3
and VC4 in converter 2 can be obtained as: 
VC3=δVin/(1-δ), VC4=Vin          (16) 
From (15) and (16), we can observe that the capacitor 
voltages VC1 and VC3 depend on the duty cycle δ and the 
input voltage Vin. Based on the voltage-second balance on 
the output inductors Lo1 and Lo2, the following equation 
can be obtained.

where δloss is the duty cycle loss in modes 4 and 8 and VF

conversion ratio M of the proposed converter is expressed 
as: 
M=Vo/Vin§2δ/n-VF/Vin          (18)

as:

Based on the circuit configuration, the voltage stresses of

S3 and S4 are clamped at vC3+vC4. Since vC3=vC4=Vin and 
vC1=vC3=δVin/(1-δ) in steady state, we can obtain the 
drain voltage of switches S1~S4 in (21).

The 2010 International Power Electronics Conference
Abstract-- A parallel LLC series resonant converter with 
output voltage doubler is presented in this paper. The 
interleaved pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique is 
adopted to reduce the ripple current on input and output 
capacitors. The capacitance of input and output capacitors 
can be reduced. The high current stress drawback of 
conventional LLC resonant converter is overcome by the 
proposed converter. Thus the adopted converter can be 
applied for high output current applications. Based on the 
series resonant behavior, all power switches are turned on 
at zero voltage switching (ZVS) and the rectifier diodes can 
be turned off at zero current switching (ZCS). Thus the 
switching losses on power semiconductors are reduced. In 
the output side, the voltage doubler topology is adopted for 
high output voltage applications. Compared with the 
conventional LLC converter, the advantages of the 
proposed circuit are low ripple currents on input and output 
terminals, small size and light weight of transformer, and 
low conduction losses on power semiconductors. In this 
paper, the principle of operation, steady state analysis and 
design consideration of the proposed converter are provided 
and discussed. In order to validate the proposed converter, 
the laboratory experiments with 24V/40A output for server 
power supply were provided.

I.  INTRODUCTION
High efficiency power converters with small package 
size and light weight are necessary for modern power 
supply unit. Power supplies with two-stage configuration 
are usually adopted in the medium power applications. 
High power factor ac-dc converter can be implemented 
with about 93~95% efficiency. To meet the efficiency 
requirements of EPA (Environment Protection Agency) 
and CSCI (Climate Saver Computing Initiative), the 
circuit efficiency of power supply unit should be greater 
than 90% for most of load conditions. Thus the dc-dc 
converter in the second-stage (with 95% PFC circuit) 
should be greater than 95% to meet the CSCI 
requirement. Soft switching techniques have been 
proposed in [1]-[7] to achieve high efficiency dc-dc 
converter. However, the high voltage or current stresses 
on power semiconductors limit the practical applications 
in power supply unit. For the series resonant converter, 
the output voltage cannot be controlled properly at no-
load condition. The drawback of parallel resonant 
converter is that the circulating energy reduces the high 
line or light load efficiency. The LLC resonant converter

under Grants NSC 99-2221-E-224-MY2 and NSC 98-2221-E-018-023. 
has been drawn attention due to its essential advantages 
of high conversion efficiency and high power density 
[8]-[13]. The half-bridge or full-bridge converter type is 
usually used at the primary side to realize the zero 
voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on for all power switches 
without any auxiliary circuit. If the switching frequency 
is lower than the series resonant frequency, the 
secondary side rectifier is operated under zero current 
switching (ZCS) condition. Then the reverse recovery 
losses for diode rectifier or the switching losses for 
synchronous rectifier are reduced. 
This paper presents an interleaved PWM LLC 
resonant converter for server or data storage system 
applications. In the proposed converter, two LLC 
resonant converters are connected in parallel with 
interleaved PWM scheme to reduce the current stresses 
on the transformer secondary winding and decrease the 
ripple currents on the output and output capacitors. Thus 
the load current can be distributed into two converter 
modules. The voltage doubler topology is used in the 
secondary side to achieve high output voltage 
application. The designed operating frequency is less 
than the series resonant frequency. Thus power switches 
are tuned on at ZVS and rectifier diodes are turned off at 
ZCS. Therefore, the switching losses of power switches 
and reverse recovery losses of rectifier diodes are 
reduced. The fundamental frequency approximation 
technique is adopted to derive the voltage conversion 
ratio and the circuit parameters. A design example of the 
proposed converter is presented. Experiments based on a 
laboratory prototype were provided to verify the 
effectiveness of the proposed converter.

laboratory prototype with 960W rated power was built to 
verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter. The 
output voltage and load current are 24V and 40A. The 
nominal voltage on the input side is 390V with an 
operating range from 350V to 430V. The selected series 
resonant frequency fr,1=fr,2=120kHz. First, we select that 
the minimum ac gain at the maximum input voltage is

VI.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Experimental results based on a laboratory prototype 
circuit with 960W rated power were presented to verify 
the effectiveness of the proposed converter. The 
specifications and circuit parameters of the prototype are 
given in Fig. 5. The front stage of the input terminal of 
the proposed converter is a boost converter with power 
factor correction to supply the stable 390V input voltage. 
Fig. 6 gives the measured waveforms of gate voltages, 
drain voltages and switch currents for switches S1 and S2
at full load condition (Po=960W). Before switches S1 and 
S2 are turned on, the drain voltages has been decreased to 
zero. Thus, the ZVS turn-on for both switches S1 and S2
is achieved. Fig. 7 illustrates the measured waveforms of 
gate voltages vS1,gs and vS3,gs and the resonant inductor 
currents vS1,gs and vS3,gs at full load condition (Po=960W). 
Since the gate voltages of S1 and S3 are phase-shifted 90

can be controlled at no-load condition with the properly 
voltage gain design. The interleaved PWM scheme can 
be generated using D-type flip flop and one inverter gate

DS1 and DS2 are anti-parallel diodes of S1 and S2,

connected between two transformers T1 and T2 to limit 
the voltage stress of power switches S1 and S2 and to 
realize flux reset of T1 and T2. During the transition 
interval of S1 and S2, capacitors CS1 and CS2 and inductors 
Lr1 and Lr2 are resonant to realize ZVS turn-on of

Power is transferred from input terminal Vin to output 
terminal Vo through S2, Cc, Lr2, T2, D3, Lo2 and Co. The 
output inductor current iLo1 decreases linearly and iLo2
increases linearly. The switch current iS2=iLr2-iLr1. This 
mode ends at time t5 as S2 is turned off. 
Mode 6 [t5t<t6]: At time t5, S2 is turned off. At this 
moment, iLr2-iLr1>0. As the switch current iS2 charges CS2
and discharges CS1, the voltage VS1,d across S1 decreases 
from Vin+VC1-VCc and the voltage VS2,d across S2 increases 
from zero. The time interval in this mode is negligible 
compared to switching period Ts. Thus the inductor 
currents iLr1 and iLr2 are considered to be constant. At time 
t6, the voltages VS1,d=Vin=VC1 and VS2,d=VC1-VCc. At this 
moment, the primary and secondary winding voltages of 
T1 and T2 are all zero. Therefore the diodes at the 
secondary side are all conducting to commutate the 
output inductor currents iLo1 and iLo2.
Mode 7 [t6≤t<t7]: At time t6, all diodes at the secondary 
side are in the commutation stage. Thus the primary and 
secondary winding voltages are zero. Diode currents iD1
and iD4 increase, and iD2 and iD3 decrease. Components Lr1,
Lr2, Cs1 and CS2 are resonant in this mode. However, the 
time interval in this mode is negligible compared to 
switching period Ts. The primary currents iLr1 and iLr2 can 
be considered as constant. Capacitor CS1 decreases from 
Vin to zero and capacitor CS2 increases from VC1-VCc to 
Vin+VC1-VCc. To ensure the ZVS turn-on of S1, voltage 
VS1,d should decrease to zero before the end of this mode. 
Therefore, the ZVS condition of S1 is given as:

is negative and the anti-parallel diode DS1 is conducting. 
Thus switch S1 can be turned on in this mode to realize 
ZVS. Diodes D1~D4 are still in the commutation stage. 
Diode currents iD1 and iD4 increase, and iD2 and iD3

where Vf is the voltage drop on diodes D1~D4, and Dloss is 
the duty cycle loss in mode 4 or mode 8. The duty cycle 
loss in mode 8 can be obtained by the diode current iD2

VI.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The experimental results with a laboratory prototype 
circuit were provided to verify the effectiveness of the 
proposed converter. Table 1 shows the main parameters 
and components in the prototype circuit. The control 
circuit was implemented by using the PWM controller 
UCC2893 from TI. Fig. 4 shows the measured gate 
voltage VS1,g, drain voltage VS1,d and switch current iS1 of 
switch S1 for half load (Po=240W) and full load 
(Po=480W). Before S1 is turned on, the switch current iS1
is negative to discharge capacitor CS1 across switch S1.
Thus the drain voltage VS1,d is decreased to zero and the 
anti-parallel diode of S1 is conducting. Therefore switch 
S1 is turned on at this instant to realize ZVS for half and 
full loads. Fig. 5 shows the measured gate voltage VS2,g,
drain voltage VS2,d and switch current iS2 of switch S2 for 
half load (Po=240W) and full load (Po=480W). Before S2
is turned on, switch current iS2 is negative to discharge 
CS2. As the drain voltage VS2,d has been decreased to zero, 
the anti-parallel diode DS2 is conducting. Thus, S2 is 
turned on at this instant to realize ZVS for both half and 
full loads.
