Abstract 
In order to bring this new field into focus and to assess the need for major research 
facilities, we propose to develop molecular sieve membrane techniques for refinery of 
nano noble metals in mesopores.  Speciation of copper and zinc in the surface 
modified MCM-41 (MCM-41-SH) (pore opening = 2.6 nm) has been studied by 
X-ray absorption near edge structural (XANES) and X-ray absorption fine structural 
(EXAFS) spectroscopies in the present work.  The least-square fitted XANES 
spectra show that Cu(II) and Zn(II) are the major copper and zinc species, respectively, 
in the channels of MCM-41-SH at 298-1173 K.  Interestingly, a small amount of 
Zn-Cu alloys is observed in the MCM-41-SH at 573 K.  At T>573 K, mainly 
nanosize CuO and Zn2SiO4 are found.  Due to aggregation of nanosize CuO at 1173 
K, the bond distance of Cu-O is increased to 1.97 Å with the coordination number 
(CN) = 3.3.  A decrease of the Zn-O bond distance (1.94 Å) at 1173 K is also 
observed.   
Chemical structure of copper active species during catalytic decomposition of 
methanol has also been studied. The least-square fitted XANES spectra show that the 
active species in the Cu-Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts are mainly low-oxidation state copper 
(such as Cu (48%) and Cu2O (40-42%)).  Of which 10-12% of the surface copper 
may involve in the catalytic decomposition of methanol.  On the contrary, zinc in the 
catalysts is little perturbed.  Nevertheless, in the presence of zinc, yields of H2 in the 
catalytic decomposition of methanol are highly increased. 
Speciation of copper (in MCM-41) extracted with a RTIL (room temperature ionic 
liquid) (e.g., [C4mim][PF6]) has been studied by extended EXAFS and XANES 
spectroscopies.  The least-square fitted XANES spectra indicate that nanosize CuO 
(93%) is the main copper species in the channels of MCM-41.  At 298 K, >60% of 
copper in MCM-41 can be extracted with the RTIL (for 30 min) which contains 
mainly Cu2+-MIm (29%) (MIm=1-methylimidazole) and nanosize CuO (31%).  
During extraction, 31% of nanosize CuO in MCM-41 may be extracted and 
migrate to the matrix of the RTIL.  In MCM-41, 29% of nanosize CuO have been 
dissolved to form Cu2+-MIm complexes in the presence of the RTIL.  Copper in the 
RTIL possessed Cu-N bond distances of 1.97-1.99 Å with coordination numbers (CNs) 
of 3.3-3.9.  Cu2+-MIm was suggested the existence of Cu(MIm)4
2+ in the RTIL.  At 
least two reaction pathes during extraction may be involved: (1) extraction of 
nanosize CuO in MCM-41 with the RTIL and (2) dissolution of nanosize CuO and

1. INTRODUCTION 
A family of mesoporous silicate and aluminosilicate molecular sieves, designated 
as M41S, was first synthesized by Mobil’s scientists in 1992 (Kresge et al., 1992; 
Beck et al., 1992).  M41S including MCM-41(mesoporous composite material) 
(hexagonal), MCM-48 (cubic) and MCM-50 (laminar) can be synthesized with liquid 
crystal templates possessing a well-order array of structure.  Mesophase 
architectures are formed by packing of surfactants (packing parameter was g = V/la0, 
where V is the volume of hydrophobic surfactant chains, l is the surfactant chain 
length, and a0 is the effective area of the interface).  The structure of aggregated 
surfactants may be cubic or lamellar phase or spherical micelles with g = 1/3-1/2, 
2/3-3/4, and <1/3, respectively (Huo et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1997).  The surfactant 
packing may influenced by charge-matching (related to pH value, cosurfactants, and 
counterions) and organic chain packing (related to temperatures and organic additives) 
(Lin and Mou, 2002).  MCM-41, tubules-within-tuble (TWT), or 
pillar-within-sphere (PWS) can be synthesized by controlling pH values of solutions 
and molecular ratios between surfactant, silicate, and water (Lin et al., 1996, 1998a, 
1998b).    
MCM-41 has attracted much attention due to its high thermal stability (up to 1300 
K), high surface areas (500-1500 m2/g), and an array of tubular channels of a uniform 
diameter (adjustable at 1.5-20 nm) (Corma et al., 1995).  The well-defined peaks at 
(100), (110), (200), and (210) of X-ray diffraction pattern at low angle (2θ) are 
suggested as a hexagonal mesopore system in MCM-41.  MCM-41 is also desirable 
as catalyst supports and potential adsorbents for large molecules.  Cu/MCM-41 and 
CuZn/MCM-41 can photocatalyze the generation of H2 for fuel cells, oxidization of 
CO and reduction of NO.   
Functional groups such as thiol (-SH) and amine (-NH2) or organic functionalities 
such as propylamine, propylthiol, and vinyl generally are grafted to modify surface 
characteristics of MCM-41 (Feng et al., 1997; Xu and Langford, 1997; Hirai et al., 
1999; Mukherjee et al., 2000).  By 29Si solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance 
(NMR), a monolayer of isolate, terminal, or cross-linked conformations of siloxane 
groups may be formed on the surface of MCM-41.  Conformations of thiols on the 
surface of MCM-41.  Fractions of surface thiols may be controlled by reactions of 
variety molecular ratio of thiol groups and mesoporous silica (Feng et al., 1997).  
Enhanced adsorption of Hg(II) onto thiol-functionalized mesoporous silica was 
observed (Mercier and Pinnavaia, 1998).  C8-C18 amines may be grafted on the 
surfaces of hexagonal mesoporous silica (Tanev and Pinnavaia, 1995).  Heavy 
metals can be adsorbed effectively onto amine-modified MCM-41 (Bois et al., 2003).   
H2 that can be generated from biomass, splitting of H2O, and gasification of organic 
wastes has been considered as a clean fuel (Nandi and Sengupta, 1998; Geoerke et al., 
2004; Lee et al., 2004; Fisher and Bell, 1999). Methanol can be produced via 
fermentation of biomass which is a renewable and neutral carbon energy resource 
(Revilla and Gonzalez-SanJose, 1998).  In 1970-80s, the methanol-to-gasoline 
process was used in some areas where fossil fuels were not available (Meisel and 
Philos, 1981).  Methanol can also be catalytic decomposed to yield H2. Catalytic 
decomposition of methanol on Cu/SiO2 led to yields of CO, CO2, H2, and methyl 
formate.4 The selectivity for methanol decomposition to yields of H2 and CO was

2. EXPERIMENTAL 
The mesoporous molecular sieves (MCM-41) were prepared in a mixture 
containing tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%, TEOS, Acrôs), 
cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (98%, C16TMAB, Acrôs) and hydrochloric acid 
(37%, HCl, Fullin).  The mixture was stirred well at 298 K for 6-12 min.  The 
solution was mixed with 300 mL of 0.125 M ammonium hydroxide solution (30%, 
NH4OH, Alorich) for one hr.  The pH value of the mixture solution was adjusted in 
the range of 8.0-9.0 with 0.1 M HCl/NH4OH.  The molar ratio of main compounds 
in the mixture was C16TMAB: TEOS: HCl: NH4OH: H2O = 1.0: 4.5: 24: 158: 11100.  
The as-synthesized MCM-41 was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 338 
K for 24 hrs and calcined at 833 K for 12 hrs.   
In the MCM-41 synthesis process, a mixture containing tetraethyl orthosilicate 
(98%, TEOS, Acrôs), cetyltrimethylammoniumbromide (98%, C16TMAB, Acrôs), 
MPTMS silane (HS(CH2)3-Si(OM)3) (for the purpose of surface modification during 
synthesis of MCM-41), and hydrochloric acid (37%, HCl, Merck) was stirred well at 
298 K for 6-12 min.  As mixed with 0.125 M of ammonia solution (25%, NH4OH, 
Merck), the pH values of the colloid solution were in the range of 8.0-9.0.  The 
molar ratio of main compounds in the mixture was C16TMAB: TEOS: MPTMS: HCl:  
NH4OH: H2O = 1.0: 4.5: 18: 24: 158: 11100.  The as-synthesized surface-modified 
MCM-41 (MCM-41-SH) was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 338 K 
for one day and calcined at 833 K for 12 hrs.   
The copper/MCM-41 was prepared by impregnation of an aqueous solution of 0.6 
M Cu(NO3)2 (99%, Hanawa Guaranted Reagent) onto the MCM-41.  
Copper/MCM-41 was calcined at 573 and 923 K for two hrs.   
The CuO-ZnO/MCM-41 or MCM-41SH was prepared by impregnation of an 
aqueous solution of 0.6 M Cu(NO3)2 (99%, Hanawa Guaranted Reagent) and 0.6 M of 
Zn(NO3)2 (99%, Hanawa Guaranted Reagent) onto the MCM-41 or MCM-41SH.  
CuO-ZnO/MCM-41 or MCM-41SH was calcined at 573, 923 and 1173 K for two hrs. 
Total 10% of copper (Cu(NO3)2 (Kanto chemical corporation)) and zinc (Zn(NO3)2 
(Kanto chemical corporation)) were wet impregnated onto ZSM-5 (10Cu/ZSM-5 
(10%Cu), 7Cu3Zn/ZSM-5 (7%Cu+3%Zn) and 5Cu5Zn/ZSM-5 (5%Cu+5%Zn)). The 
catalysts were dried at 298 K for 16 hrs, calcined at 673 K for 12 hrs, and reduced in 
10% H2/N2 (50 mL/min) at 673 K. About 1.0 g of the catalyst was packed in a 
fixed-bed flow reactor for experiments of catalytic decomposition of methanol (18% 
methanol/N2 (30 mL/min)) at 473-573 K. Concentrations of H2 was analyzed by 
GC/TCD. 
To synthesize RTIL ([C4mim][PF6]), 0.6 mole 1-chlorobutane (99.4%, TEDIA, 
USA) and 0.7 mole 1-methylimidozole (99%, Acros, USA) were refluxed at 353 K for 
72 hrs and then washed three times with 20 mL ethyl acetate (HPLC/ Spectro, Tedia, 
USA) at 298 K.  The solution was mixed with 110.4 g KPF6 (≥ 99.0%, SHOWA, 
Japan) and stirred with 400 mL of acetone (UST/NP grade, Pharmca) for 24 hrs.  
Precipitates in the solution were filtered with a 10 μm filter paper.  Solvents in the 
solution were removed by rotary evaporation.  About 40 mL of RTIL ([C4mim][PF6]) 
were prepared for characteristic and extraction experiments.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
3.1 X-ray adsorption studies of nanosize copper in MCM-41 
The XRD patterns of the calcined copper/MCM-41 at 573-923 K are shown in 
Figure 3.1.1.  After calcination at 573 and 923 K for two hrs, nanosize CuO has been 
observed in the channels of MCM-41.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  XANES can be utilized as a valence probe.  Therefore, the near-edge 3d-to-4p 
mixing features in the experimental absorption edges of copper/MCM-41 that was 
calcined at 573-923 K for two hrs have been component fitted.  The height and area 
of the near-edge band in a copper spectrum are quantitatively proportional to the 
amount of copper species.  Table 3.1.1 shows that fractions of the main copper 
species such as Cu(II)(ads) and nanosize CuO are 90 and 10%, respectively.  About 
93% of nanosize CuO was formed in MCM-41 at 573 K.  By TEM, the nanosize 
CuO is found in the channels of MCM-41 in Figure 3.1.2(a).  At a higher 
temperature (e.g., 923 K), nanosize CuO (51%) and CuO (49%) are also observed in 
MCM-41.  In Figure 3.1.2(b), CuO with a length of about 100-200 nm is found in 
the channel of MCM-41.  Figure 3.1.2(c) shows that the nanowire-type CuO has a 
length of about 100 nm with a width of about 6 nm as observed by dark-field image of 
copper/MCM-41.  The pore opening of MCM-41 is 7.2 nm that allows the nanosize 
CuO filled into the channels.  In Figure 3.1.2(d), the pattern of the nanowire-type 
CuO has d-spaces of 1.15, 1.96, and 2.32 Å corresponding to (400), (112), and (111) 
CuO phases, respectively.  Figure 3.1.2(d) reveals that the nanowire CuO has a

Although mainly ZnO and a small amount of Zn-Cu alloy are observed in 
MCM-41-SH at 573 K, as shown in Figure 3.3.3, the Zn/Cu ratio is decreased.  At 
the step I (see Figure 3.3.3), at T<573 K, about 23% of nanosize metallic zinc in 
MCM-41-SH may be formed and subsequently evaporated.  At 573-923 K (step II), 
mainly nanosize CuO is observed while 69% of zinc interact with the amorphous SiO2 
and form Zn2SiO4.  At the step III (923-1173 K), nanosize metallic copper may be 
formed via self-reduction processes.  Metallic copper may be evaporated or escaped 
from the channels and formed CuO on the external surfaces of MCM-41-SH.

3.5 Extraction of copper in MCM-41 with an ionic liquid 
The crystal plan calculated diffraction pattern shows in Figure 3.5.1(a) that the 
suspended CuO (extracted from CuO/MCM-41) in the RTIL possesses a monoclinic 
crystal line structure (see Figure 3.5.1(a)).  Nanosize CuO in the channels of 
MCM-41 was extracted and suspended in the RTIL (see Figure 3.5.1(b)).  Simulation 
using of the restricted primitive model shows the diameter of cavities in the RTIL is 
suggested between 0.1 and 1 nm (Bresme and Alejandre, 2003).  However, the 
average particle size of the suspended nanosize CuO was about 4.0 nm.  The flexible 
alkyl chains of the RTIL may be deformed to fill in nanosize CuO.  The particle size 
of suspended nanosize CuO in the RTIL was also greater than the pore opening (3 nm) 
of MCM-41.  It seems that the suspended nanosize CuO particles may be aggregated 
in the RTIL.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The time dependence for extraction of copper from CuO/MCM-41 into the RTIL at 
298-373 K is shown in Figure 3.5.2.  The extraction efficiency is highly increased 
from 63 to 81% at 298 to 373 K for at the first-hour extraction.  The maximum 
copper extraction is 98% at 373 K for 24 hrs.  In Figure 3.5.3, the rate of nanosize 
CuO suspended in the RTIL can be expressed in the first-order kinetic:  
d[x1]/dt = k1 [a0-x1] 
and 
[x2] = [a0] [k2 (1-exp(-k1t)) – k1(1-exp(-k2t))]/(k2 – k1) 
where 
  t = reacted time (hr) 
k1 = first-order reaction constant (hr
-1) 
k2 = reaction constant (hr
-1)

The RTIL ([C4min][PF6]) ionic liquid is a highly solvating and noncoordinating 
solvent.  Due to the strong electric conductivity nature of ionic liquids, chemical 
interactions between the RTIL and extracted species might be insignificant.  The 1H 
NMR spectra in Figure 3.5.4(a) shows that chemical structure of the RTIL is little 
perturbed during extraction.

also found in the RTIL (see Figure 3.5.5(b)).  Since the solubility of CuO and the 
stability constant of Cu2+-MIm (in H2O) are about 10
-7.6 and 104.23, respectively, 
nanosize CuO may be dissolved and therein Cu2+ chelated with MIm in the RTIL.  
The concentration of Cu2+-MIm in the RTIL was increased by 46% during 
extraction process for 12 hrs.  At least 94% of copper was formed Cu2+-MIm in 
the RTIL during extraction for 14 days (in Figure 3.5.2(f)).   
Generally, the EXAFS spectroscopy can provide the information on the atomic 
arrangement of samples in terms of bond distance, number and kind of near neighbors 
and static disorder.  An over 99% reliability of the EXAFS data fitting for copper 
species in the MCM-41 and RTIL is shown in Table 3.5.1.  Their Debye-Waller 
factors (Δσ2) were less than 0.01 (Δσ< 0.1 Å in general).  The CuO/MCM-41 has a 
Cu-O bond distance of 1.96 Å with a coordination number (CN) of 3.9.  The EXAFS 
data also show that copper in the RTIL phase is bonded to nitrogen with Cu-N bond 
distances of 1.97-1.99 Å.  It should be noted that the CNs of Cu-N in the RTIL were 
3-4.  The adsorption edge at 8986 eV also suggested that MIm may be chlated with 
Cu2+ in the square-planar of an octahedral structure Cu(MIm)4
2+ complex in the RTIL.

At least two reaction paths during extraction may be involved: (1) migration of 
nanosize CuO from channels of MCM-41 into the RTIL, (2) dissolution of nanosize 
CuO, and formation of Cu(MIm)4
2+ in RTIL.  31% of nanosize CuO in MCM-41 
directly migrates to the RTIL.  Formation of Cu(MIm)4
2+ in the RTIL via dissolution 
of nanosize CuO (29%) in MCM-41.
