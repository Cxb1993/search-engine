The Eighteenth International Symposium on Transport Phenomena,
27-30 August, 2007, Daejeon, KOREA
where c is the nutrient concentration in the culture
media, D the molecular diffusivity of the nutrient in the
media fluid, and V the fluid velocity vector. We
assumed glucose to be the representative nutrient in
the work. The cellular-construct layer was considered a
two-phase region made up of cell colonies and liquid
culture media. The nutrient transport was both diffusive
and convective in the fluid phase, and diffusive and
consumptive in the cell phase. Under these
circumstances, the macroscopic conservation equation
governing the nutrient concentration could be derived
by the method of volume averaging [15, 16]

In this equation, cell distribution is expressed in terms
of the cell volume fraction  , defined as the volume
occupied by cell colonies in the elementary volume
relative to the elementary volume. The volume fraction
of the culture medium phase is denoted as  . Both of
the volume fractions are part of the solution and need to
be solved with the cell balance equation. We assumed
that nutrients in the fluid and cell phases were in
equilibrium with respect to the interfacial transport
process, which yielded the nutrient concentration in the
two phases was related by eqc K c  , where c and
c are the intrinsic average concentration of the
nutrients in the cell and nutrient phases respectively,
and eqK is the equilibrium coefficient. An analytical
formula for the effective diffusivity effD comprising both
the macro and subcellular transport effects could be
obtained by assuming the cellular construct was made
up of Chang’s unit cels with a single spherical cel 
embedded in a spherical extracellular substance [17].
Also by considering the trans-membrane transport was
instantaneous relative to the extracellular diffusive
transport process, the effective diffusion coefficient of
nutrients was reduced to the Maxwel’s formula [16].
The last term on the right of Eq.(2) accounts for the
nutrient consumption that is defined through the
Michaelis-Menton kinetics, where mK is the saturation
coefficient, and mR the maximum glucose uptake rate.
The effect of perfusion was incorporated in the second
term on the left side of Eq. (2) in terms of the fluid
volume flux V though porous structures, which needs
to be solved with the fluid equations.
Cell Balance
The cell balance equation in the scaffold layer was
derived based on the consideration of cell mass
conservation [14]

Fig. 1. schematic of the perfusion system
The first term on the right side represents the
macroscopic cell diffusion resulted from the microscopic
cell random walks expressed in terms of the diffusive
coefficient cellD . Since autocrine matrix production may
be required for the cells to locomote in a highly porous
scaffold, the true diffusion coefficient of cell motion can
be a function of time and space. However, for simplicity,
we assumed the cell diffusion coefficient in the scaffold
to be a constant. The bracket on the right side of Eq. (3)
is the Modified Contois kinetics for cell growth. The
coefficient cK is the saturation coefficient, cell the
single cell mass density, dR the apoptosis rate and gR
the maximum cell growth rate. Cell growth in the
scaffold would reduce the effective pores through which
culture media can flow. The porosity and permeability of
the constructs should be affected by both the ECM and
cell volumes. Since ECM are synthesized by cells, we
assumed ECM volume directly proportion to the cell
number in the current model, and treated ECM as part
of the cellular phase without considering separately the
ECM production and distribution. Finally, since
porosities of a scaffold can be high, it is reasonable to
neglect the solid matrices, and therefore the fluid
volume fraction  was readily obtained by the
following equation once the cell volume fraction  was
solved

Culture media Flow
On considering culture media being incompressible and
Newtonian, the media fluid velocity V in the bulk fluid
layers was described by the continuity and Navier-
Stokes equations
0 V (5)
The Eighteenth International Symposium on Transport Phenomena,
27-30 August, 2007, Daejeon, KOREA
nutrient concentration in the fluid phase, c , was
solved from Eq.(1) for the bulk fluid layers and from
Eq.(2) for the scaffold layer. The cell distribution in
terms of the cell volume fraction  was solved from Eq.
(3). Eqs.(5) and (6) were solved for the flow velocities
and pressure in the two fluid layers, and Eqs. (7) and
(8) for the flow velocity and pressure in the scaffold
layer. Mesh refinement tests were performed to ensure
relative errors smaller than 310 .

RESULTS
Part of the parameter data used in simulation was quoted
from literature [14]. Other values used were as listed in
Table 1. Glucose concentration c after 30 culture days
normalized by the concentration in the media reservoir
0c is shown in Fig.2, in which the space dimensions
have been scaled by the scaffold thickness H . The
relative significance of glucose perfusion to diffusion is
presented by the dimensionless Peclet number,

(15)
The values of Pe are 100 and 600 in Fig. 2a and 1b
respectively. The right boundaries of the figures
correspond to the symmetric center line, and the left
sides are the chamber wall. The glucose concentration
increased with increasing Pe , indicating that perfusion
enhanced the nutrient transport throughout the scaffold.
Glucose concentration expressed a virtually uniform
distribution in the upper inlet fluid layer, stratifications
ahead of and inside the cellular construct, and then the
contours gradually became virtual vertical in the upper
part of the downstream outlet fluid layer. Nutrients were
richest in the inlet fluid layers, and most depleted at the
lower corner of the cellular construct where the flow
velocity was lowest due to the flow retardation by the
chamber wall. When glucose was carried along by the
fluid flow into the outlet fluid layer, glucose
concentration remained virtually constant along
streamlines.
The corresponding cell culture results expressed in
terms of the cell volume fraction  are illustrated in
Fig.3 for Pe =100 and 600 respectively. As shown, the
cell growth was intensified by perfusion because the
nutrient (glucose) was distributed more evenly as in
Fig.2b. Effects of perfusion on cell growth were
summarized by expressing the average cell growth
rate c, avgR over the whole cellular construct versus the
Peclet number Pe (Fig.4). Results show the overall cell
growth rate was increased by increasing Pe , and it
ultimately approached an asymptote as Pe became
large.
