2Task I
With the scaling of device dimensions,
the device mismatching that stems from
stochastic fluctuations is becoming a concern
for nanoscale MOSFETs [6]-[8]. Device
mismatch may limit the achievable accuracy in
analog applications such as multiplexed analog
systems, digital-to-analog converters,
reference source, and the SRAM. Since
strained silicon is widely used in state-of-the-
art CMOS technologies to enable the mobility
scaling [9]-[10], a comprehensive study
regarding the impact of strain on device
mismatch is needed.
In this work, we conduct a systematic
comparison of the mismatching properties of
nanoscale strained MOSFETs between
strained and unstrained devices.
Task II
Uniaxial strained-Si technology is
crucial to transistor performance in state-of-
the-art CMOS development [11]-[12]. The
temperature effect on strain-enhanced mobility
is of special importance because it may
provide insights for the underlying
mechanisms responsible for the performance
enhancement. Although several studies have
investigated the temperature effect on strain-
enhanced mobility in the past [13]-[16], the
temperature effect of process-induced uniaxial
strain for nanoscale pMOSFETs is still not
clear and merits investigation.
In addition, low frequency noise in
nanoscale CMOS devices is becoming
increasingly important because it may limit the
functionality of analog and digital circuits [17].
Our pervious study showed that the carrier-
number-fluctuations origin input-referred
voltage noise of the uniaxial compressive
strained pMOSFETs can be improved
intrinsically by reducing the tunneling
attenuation length through the strain-increased
out-of-plane effective mass and tunneling
barrier height [18]. Nevertheless, the carrier-
number-fluctuations origin low frequency
noise only dominates in the low gate voltage
overdrive (Vgst) regime. Whether there exists
an intrinsic strain effect on the low frequency
noise characteristics in the high Vgst regime is
still not clear and merits investigation.
In this work, we conduct an
experimental assessment for the impact of the
process-induced uniaxial strain on the
temperature dependence of carrier mobility
and the carrier-mobility-fluctuations origin
low frequency noise in nanoscale pMOSFETs.
Task III
Because the carrier mobility of
MOSFET depends on surface orientation, it
has been proposed that the circuit performance
of FinFET can be enhanced with the optimized
surface orientation [19]-[21]. However, the
immunity of FinFET structure with various
surface orientations to process variations has
rarely been examined. As the channel
thickness (i.e., fin width) of FinFET scales
down, the quantum confinement effect may
become significant. This 1-D confinement
effect may result in the threshold voltage (Vth)
shift and impact the Vth variability. Moreover,
the impact of quantum confinement may show
surface-orientation dependence.
In this work, we investigate the Vth
variability of Si- and Ge-channel FinFET with
various surface orientations using analytical
solution of Schrödinger equation. The
theoretical model provides us a physical and
efficient method to explore the impact of
quantum-confinement effect. In addition, to
validate the results predicted by the theoretical
model, we also perform the 3-D atomistic
simulation to assess the Vth dispersion due to
fin line-edge-roughness (fin-LER) for FinFET
with various surface orientations.
4for the strained and control devices are nearly
the same, as demonstrated in Fig. 4, the
reduced Vth mismatch can be explained by the
strain-reduced gm/Id in the high |Vgst| saturation
region (e.g. |Vd|=1V) as shown in Fig. 7. The
reduced gm/Id in the high |Vgst| saturation
region for the strained device can be attributed
to the strain-reduced Esat. The strain- reduced
Esat results from the enhanced mobility in the
strained device. The enhancement in mobility
corresponds to an increase in slope of the
carrier velocity versus lateral field
characteristic and a reduction in the critical
field (Esat) for velocity saturation.
In conclusion, we have investigated and
analyzed the mismatching properties of
nanoscale strained PMOSFETs under various
bias conditions. In the low |Vgst| regime, the
σ(ΔId)/Id for the strained device is enhanced
while the threshold voltage mismatch of the
strained device is nearly identical to that of the
control one. The increased σ(ΔId)/Id for the
strained device can be attributed to the
enhanced gm/Id. In other words, theσ(ΔId)/Id of
the strained device is almost the same as the
unstrained one at a given gm/Id. In the high
|Vgst| linear region, the smallerσ(ΔId)/Id for the
strained device results from its smallerσ(Δβ)/β,
albeit the σ(Δβ) for the strained device is
larger than that of the unstrained one. In the
high |Vgst| saturation regime, the improvement
in σ(ΔId)/Id for the strained device is further
enhanced because of the strain-reduced Esat.
2. Impact of uniaxial strain on the
temperature dependence of carrier mobility
[3] and the carrier-mobility-fluctuation low-
frequency noise [4] in nanoscale
pMOSFETs
Fig. 8 shows the drain current (ID)
versus gate voltage characteristics at various
temperatures for the PMOS devices under test.
The drain current shows strong correlation
with stressor types and can be explained by the
extracted carrier mobility, as shown in Fig. 9.
It can be seen from Fig. 9 that the short
channel mobility in PMOS (LEFF = 95 nm)
shows significant dependence on the uniaxial
strain. The PMOS mobility prefers
compressive stress because of the strain-
reduced conductivity effective mass [9]. In
addition, Fig. 9 shows that the mobility is
degraded when temperature increases in the
high vertical-field region, where phonon
scattering is important [25]-[26]. Moreover,
the temperature dependence of mobility shows
strong sensitivity to strain. In other words, as
the mobility is enhanced by compressive strain,
its temperature dependence also increases. Fig.
10 shows the temperature sensitivity (log μ/ 
log T) of the hole mobility versus the vertical
effective electric field (EEFF). For a given
stressor, it can be seen that the temperature
sensitivity increases (i.e., more negative) and
then saturates as EEFF increases. More
importantly, the logμ/ logT for the PFET under
compressive strain is the highest in absolute
value among the three stressors. In other
words, the scattering mechanism of the PMOS
device becomes more phonon limited [25]-[26]
under compressive strain. This also explains
why the temperature sensitivity of drain
current for the compressively strained PFET is
the largest among the three stressors, as shown
in Fig. 8. Fig. 11 shows the hole-mobility
enhancement (Δμ/μ) versus temperature at
EEFF = 1.5MV/cm. It shows that for both
compressive and tensile stressors, the
magnitude of Δμ/μ decreases as temperature
increases. Our result from the process-induced
uniaxial stressors is consistent with the study
in [16], in which an external compressive
uniaxial mechanical stress was applied. Based
on the model proposed in [16], it is plausible
that as temperature increases, the
compressively strained PFET has less holes to
populate states near the band edge where the
conductivity effective mass along the channel
direction is smaller. Therefore, the observed
mobility enhancement decreases with
increasing temperature.
6potential energy EC(x) =x2 +. and are
length-dependent coefficients and can be
obtained from the channel potential solution of
Poisson’s equation under subthreshold region 
[32]. Using the parabolic-well approximation,
an analytical solution of (1) can be obtained.
Note that as =0 (i.e., EC is spatially
constant), Ψj(x) will return to the form of
sinusoidal functions, which is the solution for
the flat-well approximation [30]. The jth
eigen-energy Ej can be determined by the
boundary condition Ψj (x = tch/2) = 0. Thus, the
eigen-energy and eigenfunction of short-
channel FinFET under subthreshold region can
be derived.
Fig. 18 shows that for a short-channel
lightly-doped FinFET, the conduction band
edge EC is bended from a flat well to a
parabolic-like well due to source/drain
coupling, and the Ej calculated by our model
considering the parabolic-well approximation
agrees well with the TCAD simulation that
numerically solves the self-consistent solution
of Poisson and Schrödinger equations [33]. Fig.
19 shows the channel length (Leff) dependence
of the energy difference of E0 and the bottom
of well EC(x = 0). In contrast to the constant E0
calculated from the flat-well approximation,
both the TCAD simulation and our model
show that the E0 increases with decreasing Leff.
To assess the impact of quantum
confinement on Vth, the Vth is defined as the
VGS at which the average electron density of
the cross-section at y = Leff /2 (highest
potential barrier for low VDS) exceeds the
channel doping concentration. Fig. 20 verifies
the electron density distribution calculated
from the classical (CL) model and the
quantum-confinement (QC) model with the
TCAD simulations.
Besides theoretical model, we also
perform atomistic simulation to assess the
problem. We employ the Fourier synthesis
approach that generates the line edge patterns
using the Gaussian autocorrelation function as
the power spectrum [34], and then the Monte
Carlo simulations. The parameters used for the
fin-LER simulations in this study are the rms
amplitude (Δ) = 1.5nm and the correlation
length (Λ) = 20nm [35]. Fig. 21 shows the
nominal 3-D FinFET structure and some of the
150 samples used in our atomistic simulation.
For FinFET structure, different surface
orientations such as (100), (110), and (111)
can be achieved by rotating the device layout
in the wafer plane [20]. Fig. 22 shows that for
Si-FinFET with a small tch, the Vth and its
sensitivity to channel thickness (tch) variation
considering the quantum-confinement effect is
larger than that predicted by the CL model.
Moreover, the Vth of (111)- and (110)-surface
increases more rapidly than that of (100)-
surface with decreasing tch. This is because the
quantum-confinement effect depends on
surface orientation, as indicated by the inset of
Fig. 22. For high-mobility channel such as Ge-
FinFET, the Vth dispersion due to quantum-
confinement becomes more significant. Fig. 23
shows that the Vth of (100)-surface increases
more rapidly than (110)- and (111)- surface
with reducing tch. This is because the quantum-
confinement effect of (100)-surface is larger
than that of (110)- and (111)-surface, as
indicated by the inset of Fig. 23.
Fig. 24 shows the Vth variability of (100)-
and (110)- surface Si-FinFET derived from the
atomistic simulation. It can be seen that the
mean value as well as its spread of Vth for
(110)-surface are larger than those of (100)-
surface due to quantum confinement. The
result is consistent with the Vth sensitivity to
tch calculated by our theoretical model (Fig.
22). More results from atomistic simulation
will be presented.
Besides the Vth sensitivity to tch, the
quantum-confinement effect also affects the
Vth sensitivity to the Leff variation. Fig. 25
shows that for Ge-FinFET, the degree of Vth
roll-off predicted by our QC model is (100) <
(110) < (111) < CL, which is opposite to the
Vth sensitivity to the tch variation (Fig. 23). In
other words, while the quantum-confinement

他們的演講可以廣泛而快速地瀏覽他們在自己領域的研究內容，是啟發自己研究想
法的一個好機會。另外他們的投影片也已印成書面資料，帶回來後將來有需要時可 
以參考裡面的內容或是引用的 paper等。 
許多關注，因此許多研究主題不是矽元件的 paper也都會投到這個會議來。而且這個
會議之後接下來就是 VLSI Symposium的舉行，因此與會者許多皆是來自大公司或學
術界的知名人物。如果 paper能在這個會議上被接受，在這個領域中曝光率比較高，
也能讓較多人知道自己的研究內容。因此應該多加宣傳，讓在台灣做 III-V族或是鍺
元件的研究也能到這個會議上來發表，也可以增加台灣在半導體研究上的知名度。

Fig. 6. Comparison of the tch dependence of Vth for Si-FinFET with 
various surface orientations and the classical model (CL). The Vth shift 
due to quantum confinement is mainly determined by the ground-state 
energy as indicated by the inset. 
Fig. 7. Comparison of the tch dependence of Vth for Ge-FinFET with various 
surface orientations and the classical model (CL). The inset shows the 
comparison of the ground-state energy for various surface orientations. 
Fig. 8. The Vth of (110)-surface for Si-FinFET shows larger mean value 
and spread than those of (100)-surface. Fig. 9. Comparison of the Leff dependence of Vth (Vth roll-off) for 
Ge-FinFET with various surface orientations and the classical model (CL).
