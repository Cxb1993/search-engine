Robust Synchronization for OFDM 
 
Abstract 
   In recent years, many blind estimators utilizing cyclic prefix (CP) have been proposed to achieve 
synchronization for OFDM systems. These CP estimators usually suffer from great degradation when the 
noise level is high or the channel distortion is severe, therefore, their use is mostly limited to high SNR 
applications. In this project, we present a robust symbol timing estimation for OFDM signals utilizing 
reversed cyclic prefix (RCP). The simulation results show that the proposed RCP estimator performs well in 
both (low SNR) AWGN and ITU-R M.1225 multipath channels. Almost no error is observed for the RCP 
estimator, in the 115200 trials, even at an extremely small SNR.

I. Introduction 
 Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has gained considerable attention in the last few 
years. Important features of OFDM systems include immunity to frequency selective fading in multipath 
environments. OFDM has been employed for digital audio broadcasting (DAB), digital video broadcasting 
(DVB), integrated services digital broadcasting (ISDB), digital subscriber line (xDSL), and the fixed wireless 
access system in IEEE 802.16.3 standard. OFDM is also one of the most promising techniques in application 
to the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication. However, OFDM systems are very sensitive to 
erroneous synchronization. Therefore, reliable synchronization schemes must be designed for these systems. 
    Various schemes for OFDM applications have been proposed to achieve better synchronization [1]-[17]. 
These OFDM synchronization algorithms can be classified into two categories: data-aided estimation and 
nondata-aided (also known as blind) estimation. For data-aided estimators [9]-[17], synchronization is 
achieved by the periodic transmission of pilot symbols or training sequences. On the other hand, 
nondata-aided or blind estimators, which do not require extra data blocks to transmit synchronization 
information, have better bandwidth efficiency than data-aided schemes. In [1]-[8], many blind estimators were 
proposed by exploiting the correlation between the cyclic prefix (CP) for different channel models. These CP 
estimators usually suffer from great degradation when the noise level is high or the channel distortion is 
severe, therefore, their use is mostly limited to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) applications [1]. In this 
project, we present a robust symbol timing estimation for OFDM signals utilizing reversed cyclic prefix 
(RCP). The mean square errors (MSE) of OFDM symbol timing estimation are provided for AWGN and 
ITU-R M.1225 multipath channels. 
 This project is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the OFDM signal model and present a 
modified maximum-likelihood (ML) blind estimator in AWGN channel. Section III investigates the estimation 
of symbol timing for OFDM signals utilizing reversed cyclic prefix (RCP) guard interval (GI). In Section IV, 
we illustrate the estimation performance with simulation results and we discuss these in Section V. 
II. Symbol Timing Estimation utilizing Cyclic Prefix  
    In OFDM systems, an OFDM symbol is generated by performing the inverse discrete Fourier transform 
(IDFT) on N data symbols, that is,

where Xi,n is the ith complex data symbol of the nth subcarrier. 
In OFDM system, intersymbol interference (ISI) can be avoided by inserting guard interval (GI) with 
length greater than the channel impulse response. The cyclic prefix (CP) is the most common guard interval 
(GI). A cyclic prefix s_cp, which is a copy of the last NGI samples of the OFDM symbol, is prefixed to the

From (11) and (12), it is obvious that the calculation of λ2(θ) and β2(θ) is conditional on ]1,0[ −∈ Nθ  
or ]1,[ −+∈ GINNNθ . The symbol timing error is uniformly distributed over ]1,0[ −+ GINN . We have no 
information on symbol timing offset in advance.  
C. Modified Beeks method-II 
To obtain a simplified blind estimation, we present a modified Beeks method-II which is performed over 
the entire range of the estimation with the assumption that a receiver observes 2N+2NGI consecutive samples 
in r given the timing offset ]1,0[ −+∈ GINNθ . The symbol timing offset estimate

    This modified method provides a simple estimate for the symbol timing. However, the estimation 
performance is still unsatisfactory since the lowly sharp log-likelihood function (see Figures 2-3) results in 
large estimation error.     
III. Timing Estimation utilizing Reversed Cyclic Prefix  
In this section, we investigate the estimation of symbol timing of OFDM signals utilizing reversed cyclic 
prefix (RCP) guard interval (GI) to improve the estimation performance. 
In order to eliminate the intersymbol interference (ISI) in OFDM systems, guard interval (GI) with a 
length longer than the channel length is used. There are several options for guard interval. One choice of 
guard interval is zero padding (ZP). In the ZP scheme, the zero-padded waveform would destroy the 
orthogonality of subcarriers and results in intercarrier interference (ICI). The cyclic prefix (CP) is a good 
substitute of the zero-padding guard interval. In the CP (as well as RCP) scheme, the orthogonality of 
subcarriers can be preserved consequently.  
A reversed cyclic prefix s_rcp, which is a time reversed version of cyclic prefix s_cp, is prefixed to the 
transmitted symbol in the guard interval. The transmitted OFDM symbol is given by
