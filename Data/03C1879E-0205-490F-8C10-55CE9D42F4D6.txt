Abstract 
A novel magnetic MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposite was prepared by blend the 
carboxyl-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTCOOH) and the emeralidine 
base of polyaniline (PAn) in dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature.  The existence of 
hydrogen bond between PAn and MWNTCOOH was evidenced by Fourier-transform 
infrared spectrometer (FT-IR).  The main characteristic peaks of PAn shifted to lower 
frequency, which was attributed to the proton doping with MWNTCOOH.  The doping level 
was about 0.35 measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the conductivity of 
MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposite was 4.2×10-5 S/cm measured by four-point probe. From 
superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer (SQUID), the saturated 
magnetization (Ms) and coercive force (Hs) of MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposite were 
1.4×10-4 emu/g and 154.1 Oe, respectively.  The value of Ms is one order higher than that of 
HCl-doped PAn, implying the magnetism of MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposite was 
attributed from MWNTCOOH.  To determine the biocompatibility of the nanocomposite, 
MWNTCOOH/PAn (0.3 mg/mL) was added to cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) 
cells in a culture dish with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air at 37 ℃ for 72 hr.  
No significant effect of MWNTCOOH/PAn on the morphology of HEK 293 cell or cell 
number was observed.  It was concluded that MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposite showed a 
good biocompatibility with HEK 293 cells and had a potential for biological applications.

2. Experimental 
2.1 Materials 
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (S type, 10-20 nm, ＞95%) were purchased from 
the Desunnano Co. Ltd.  Aniline monomer, sodium hydride (NaH, 60% dispered in mineral 
oil), ammonium persulfate, hydrochloric acid (37 wt%), sodium hydroxide and ammonium 
hydroxide (28 wt%) were obtained from Merck.  Dimethl-sulfoxide (DMSO) was from 
Tokyo Kasei Kogyo.  Aniline and DMSO were purified before use.  The cell culture was 
used the cell line of HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney cells).  It was obtained from Prof. 
Hung-Li Wang for the graduate institute of basic medical science of the Ghang Gung 
University.   
 
2.2 Instrumentation 
Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images were obtained 
from Hitachi S-5000 Field-emission SEM system.  Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
spectra were obtained using a Bruker-Tensor 27 FT-IR spectroscopy.  The samples were 
obtained using KBr pellets.  Chemical analysis of the samples was performed using VG 
Scientific ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).  The four-probe method 
was measured the conductivity at room temperature. The magnetic properties of 
nanocomposites have been measured by using a Quantum Design MPMS7 SQUID 
magnetometer. 
 
2.3 Preparation of MWNTCOOH 
The crude MWNTs (20 mg) were treated with a 3/1 mixture of concentrated 
H2SO4/HNO3 (60 mL) solution. The mixture was stirred for 15 min and then placed in an 
ultrasonic bath (43 KHz) at 50  for 3hr. Then, the mixture was collected by filtration ℃
through a 0.22µm Millipore polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and washed with 
deionized water until its pH is about 7.  The filtered solid was dried under vacuum for 12 hr 
and carboxylic acid-functionalized MWNTs (MWNTCOOH) was obtained. 
 
2.4 Preparation of MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites 
The emeraldine base form of polyaniline was synthesized by a chemical oxidation 
method similar to that of MacDiarmid and co-workers [19].  The dried emeraldine base 
form of PAn was (10 mg) blended with MWNTCOOH (PAn/MWNTCOOH=1/1 by weight) 
in dried dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at about 25 .℃   The blended solution was slowly added

between the PAn and MWNTCOOH, because of the strong hydrogen binding interaction 
between the amine group of PAn and the carboxylic acid group of MWNTCOOH.   
 
3.2 FT-IR analysis 
　 Infrared spectra of crude MWNT, MWNTCOOH, PAn and MWNTCOOH/(PAn) 
nanocomposites are shown in Fig. 2 (curves (a)-(d), respectively).  For crude MWNT (Fig. 
2(a)), the presence of the absorption peak at 1547 and 1165 cm-1, which indicate the C=C and 
C-O-C stretching vibrations of the carbon nanotubes [20].  For MWNTCOOH (Fig. 2(b)), 
the characteristic absorption peak at 3418 cm-1, which indicates the O-H stretching vibration 
of carboxylic acid group [20].  The presence of the absorption peak at 1714 cm-1, which 
could be assigned to the C＝O stretching vibration of carboxyl-functional group [20].  The 
presence of the absorption peak at 1575 cm-1 could be assigned to the C=C stretching mode 
of the carbon nanotubes [20].  The absorption peak at 1167 cm-1 is attributed to the C-O 
stretching vibration of the carboxylic-functionalized group [20].  In comparison Fig. 2(a) 
with 2(b), it shows that the presence of carboxylic acid group on the nanotubes surface.  The 
characteristic absorption peaks of PAn (Fig. 2(c)) such as that of amino groups (-NH2), the 
bands of the quinoid ring and the benzeneoid ring, Caromatic-N stretching and C-H out-of-plane 
bending vibrations of the 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring clearly appeared at 3233, 1581, 1502, 
1308 and 831 cm-1, respectively [21].   
For MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites, the characteristic peak of N-H 
stretching of PAn shifted from 3233 to 3128 cm-1.  The red shift of N-H stretching of PAn is 
due to the hydrogen binding interaction between N atom of the amine group of PAn and H 
atom of the carboxylic acid group of the nanotubes.  The C=O absorption peak was at 1710 
cm-1, which indicated the existence of carboxylic-functional groups in the 
MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites.  The peak was shifted to the lower frequency by about 
4 cm-1 (from 1714 to 1710 cm-1), which implied that the hydrogen bond interaction between 
C=O structure of the carboxyl-functional of the MWNTCOOH and N-H structure of the PAn 
molecular.  Meanwhile, all of the characteristic absorption peaks of PAn were observed, 
which also shifted to lower frequencies.  The C=C stretching vibrations of the quinoid ring 
and the benzeneoid ring were shifted from 1581 to 1566 cm-1 and 1502 to 1491 cm-1, 
respectively, and the Caromatic-N stretching was shifted from 1308 to 1296 cm-1.  These 
results imply that the doping of PAn with carboxyl-acid and the formation of hydrogen bond 
between them [20].

reported that the Ms of PAn after p-doping with HCl was 10-5 emu/g [25].  Therefore it was 
reasonably to conclude that the magnetic properties of nanocomposites were mainly 
contributed from MWNTCOOH.  Figure 4 showed that Ms and Hs of MWNTCOOH were 
lower than those of MWNTCOOH.  The main reason was attributed to the encapsulation of 
MWNTCOOH with PAn, which blocked the magnetic interaction between carbon tube and 
carbon tube and lead to the decrease of magnetic properties.  However, the Hs of 
MWNTCOOH (195.8 Oe) was higher than that of MWNTCOOH/PAn (154.1 Oe).  This is 
because the emeraldine base of PAn without any Hs [26]. The decrease of Hs of 
MWNTCOOH/PAn was affected by the wrapping of PAn. 
 
3.6 Biocompatibility 
Figure 5 was the optical micrographs of HEK 293 cells cultured with (b,d) and 
without (a,c) MWNTCOOH/PAn after 24 (a,b) and 72 (c,d) hours (400 X).  It was observed 
that cultured HEK 293 cells were adhere to MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites and started 
to grow their neuritis after 24 hr.  For 72 hr, the neuritis of HEK 293 cells became longer 
and their branches were also formed.  In comparison Fig. 2(c) with (2d), it showed that most 
of HEK 293 cells were still survive for the cell cultured with nanocomposites for 72 hr.  No 
significant effects of MWNTCOOH/PAn on the growth morphology and cell number of HEK 
293 cells were observed.  It was concluded that MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites 
showed a good biocompatibility with HEK 293 cells and had a potential for biological 
applications. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have successfully prepared the MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites with the 
modified surfaces of carboxylic acid-functionalizied multi-walled carbon nanotubes 
(MWNTCOOH) and the emeraldine base form of PAn. The structure, magnetic property and 
biocompatibility of the MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposites were investigated using the 
various measurement methods.  The results were concluded as follow： 
1. From FTIR spectra, the peaks due to O-H, C=O and C-O stretching vibrations of 
carboxylic acid group at 3418, 1714 and 1167 cm-1, respectively1, of MWNTCOOH were 
observed.  It indicated the presence of the -COOH group of MWNTCOOH.  For 
MWNTCOOH/PAn nanocomposite, the characteristic peaks of N-H stretching vibration 
of PAn and C=O stretching vibration of MWNTCOOH shifted to lower frequencies at 
3128 and 1710 cm-1, respectively, which implyed the formation of hydrogen bond
