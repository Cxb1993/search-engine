Abstract 
 
Traditional antenna array will have 
grating lobes if the antenna element 
spacing is not special arrangement. The 
problems of grating lobes will occur in 
antenna array if operating frequency is 
higher. In this paper, a uniformly spaced 
linear antenna array which composes of 
UWB CPW-Fed Bow-tie slot antennas, 
UWB cable line and UWB BFN (beam 
forming network) is studied. Test results 
in frequency domain, grating lobes for 
the radiation pattern are occurred. By 
using the Fourier transformation from 
frequency domain to time domain, the 
grating lobes are significantly reduced. 
The wider the frequency bandwidth, the 
lower the grating lobes in radiation 
pattern will be happened. The test 
results are agreed with that of 
simulation.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
For the traditional antenna array, 
radiation pattern for main bean and 
grating lobes will follow the following 
equation,   
 
                            
)(sin 1
d
n
GL
λθ ±= −                         
(1) 
 
Where d is the element spacing in 
wavelength, λ  is the wavelength, and 
n is an integer. The main beam is with 
n=0. Grating lobes occur with n is not 
equal to zero.  For example, λ5.1=d , 
the first grating lobe occurs at 
08.41=θ .  
 4
db and -10 db for frequency between 
3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. The fractional 
bandwidth is 107 % with return loss 
with -9 db. The phase linearity for S21, 
S31, S41, S51 is shown in Fig.6. The 
maximum phase deviation from the 
linear phase is about 10 degrees for the 
whole band. 
 
c. UWB RF Coaxial Cables 
In order to develop an UWB 
antenna array, except for the UWB 
antenna elements, and UWB BFN, the 
RF coaxial cables are also important. 
The four identical 60 mm coaxial cables 
are with ULA-316 as shown in Fig. 7. 
The measured maximum insertion loss 
for the four coaxial for the designed 
band is less than 3 dB as shown in Fig.8.  
 
3. UWB Array and Test Results 
 
The final assembly of the UWB 
antenna array is shown in Fig. 9. Four 
bowtie antenna elements are linear array 
in H-plane with element spacing 13 cm. 
Four identical coaxial cables are 
connected to the antenna elements. 
Other ports of the cables are connected 
to the UWB BFN.  The phase response 
of the UWB antenna array and UWB 
antenna element is measured by impulse 
time domain network analyzer as shown 
in Fig. 10. From Fig.10, the phase 
deviation is small between the UWB 
antenna array and UWB antenna 
element.  
For the impulse time response 
measurement, an Gaussian time domain 
signal with pulse width 30 ps is 
transmitted. The distance between 
transmit antenna and UWB array is 4 
meters. Two nanosecond gate window is 
applied to the impulse time response.  
The impulse time response for the UWB 
array at both broadside (0 degree) and 
endfire directions is shown in Fig.11. 
The gated impulse time response of 
the UWB array is transformed to the 
frequency domain by Fourier 
transformation for different aspect angle. 
Sixteen with frequency interval 500 
MHz  and seventy-six frequencies with 
frequency interval 100 MHz are used for 
the frequency band between 3.1 GHz 
and 10.6 GHz. Fig.12 is the power 
pattern at single frequency 3.1 GHz. The 
grating lobe is about 4 dB at 3.1 GHz.  
Figs.13 & 14 show the time domain 
pattern response with 16 & 76 
frequencies respectively. The grating 
lobe power level for Fig.13 and Fig.14 is 
about 7.5 dB and 11 dB below the main 
lobe. Comparing Fig.13 and Fig.14, it is 
seen that RMS sidelobe level is smaller 
with 76 frequencies. From the test 
results of Figs.12&13&14, we can have 
conclusion that the UWB array will have 
the capability of radiation pattern 
without grating lobe. It is agreed with 
that of simulation. 
 
4. Conclusion

of these antennas are implemented. Except for the UWB 
TEM horn antenna, the material is with FR4. The 
dielectric constant is 4.4. The thickness of substrate is 
1.6 mm. The dimension of ground plane is less than 50 
mm by50 mm. The impedance bandwidth can be tuned 
with return loss 10 dB with 3.1 to 10.6 GHz for these 
antennas. These implemented antennas are described in 
the followings: 
2.1 Folk-shape UWB antenna with tuning stub 
The geometry of this antenna is shown in 
Fig.1. Four inner corners and metal plate are used 
for impedance tuning. By different sizes of metal 
tuning plate with fixed size of four inner corners, 
the impedance variation is shown in Fig. 2. The size 
of corners and metal plate will affect the impedance. 
The antenna gain is varied from 2 to 7 dBi for the 
desired band. 
2.2 Ring slot UWB antenna with microstrip feed line 
The size of this antenna is with 48 mm by 47 
mm is shown in Fig.3. The simulated and measured 
return loss is shown in Fig.4.    
2.3 Horn-shape UWB antenna 
The geometry and impedance are shown in 
Figs.5 &6.  
2.4 Horn-shape with band notch UWB antenna 
The geometry and return loss by both 
simulation and measurement are shown in Figs.7&8. 
By adjusting the size and position of slits, the band 
notch capability can be achieved. 
2.5 CPW fed UWB monopole antenna 
The geometry and return loss of this antenna are 
shown in Figs. 9&10.  
2.6 CPW U-type UWB antenna 
The geometry and return loss are shown in 
Figs.11&12. 
2.7 UWB TEM horn antenna 
The geometry and return loss are shown in 
Figs.13&14. The bandwidth of return loss with 9 dB 
is from 3 GHz to 40 GHz. This UWB antenna will 
be used as the transmit antenna feed in antenna near 
field test range. 
 
Application in Near Field Antenna Test 
Range 
 
By using the characteristics of wideband and higher 
directivity of the TEM horn antenna, the TEM horn 
antenna will be used as the transmit feed as shown in 
Fig.15 instead of various kinds of narrowband feeds as 
shown in Fig.16 for the antenna near field rang. The 
AUT (antenna under test) is the wideband double ridge 
horn antenna. Wideband of double ridge horn antenna 
are measured.  Figs. 17&18 are the H-plane and 
E-plane patterns of AUT at 12 GHz. The dot red line is 
using the narrowband WR90 as the transmit antenna 
feed. The black solid line is using the TEM horn antenna 
as the transmit antenna feed. The test results of far field 
patterns are quite similar by using either various kinds 
of narrowband feeds or single UWB TEM horn as the 
feed. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Different kinds of UWB antennas are simulated. Seven 
of these simulated UWB antennas are implemented. Test 
results of these implemented antennas are similar to that 
of simulation. The size of these UWB antennas with 
ground plane is less than 5 cm by 5 cm. The desired 
impedance bandwidth can be adjusted by the HFSS 
simulation tool. The shape of radiator and ground plane 
are the major parameters of the impedance bandwidth. 
The UWB TEM horn antenna is used for transmit feed 
antenna in antenna near field test range. The test results 
of far field patterns by either the single UWB TEM horn 
antenna or multiple narrowband feeds are quite similar.
