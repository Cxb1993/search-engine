The electric and magnetic fields, E and H, can be 
found from the above equations, Eqs.(2-7), in space 
domain.  However, the derivation of electric and 
magnetic fields in space domain will be more 
complicated by ways of Green’s function 
representations and differential-integral expression for 
anisotropic substrates [19-20].  It should be noted that 
the relationship between the tangential components of 
the electric fields and the unknown current sources 
could be expressed in terms of a simple impedance 
matrix expression in spectral domain, and the 
impedance matrix in spectral domain is more helpful 
to compute the propagation characteristics.

2.2 Solution Technique of Microstrip Antenna 
The immittance functions in spectral domain can 
be derived from Hertzian potentials and boundary 
conditions at the interfaces.  The unknown spectral 
current components, zJ

terms of linear combinations of known basis functions

Equations (33-38) and (46-54) define the 
electromagnetic properties and boundary conditions of 
each lamina in spectral domain, and the electromagnetic 
fields radiating in free space can be solved lamina by 
lamina from the ground plane to the top layer of the 
composite laminate.  The coefficients of Eqs.(39-40) 
and (44-45) can then be solved by substituting the 
electromagnetic fields into the suitable boundary 
conditions at different interfaces, and all the coefficients 
will be functions of the current densities, zJ
~  and xJ
~ , 
in spectral domain.  The components of the electric 
field in spectral domain on the top of composite laminate 
will then be represented as corresponding coefficients, 
 and , according to Eqs.(33-35).  After solving 
coefficients  and , the tangential electric fields 
on the top surface can be represented as

,       (55) 
where the immittance matrix in spectral domain is 
composed of immittance functions, Z plyNij − ,
~ .  
Although the form of Eq.(55) is similar to Eq.(12), the 
immittance functions of these two equation are 
significantly different because Eq.(55) is for laminae 
of distinct ply angles stacking in sequence while 
Eq.(12) only has the effect of one ply angle.  The 
stacking complexity of composite laminates will lead 
to significantly different antenna performance. 
As the immittance functions being derived from 
Hertzian potentials in spectral domain, the unknown 
spectral current components, zJ
~  and xJ
~ , can be 
expanded in terms of the linear combinations of 
known basis functions as Eqs.(13-14) to solve the 
problem that microstrip antennas embedded in 
composite laminates.  By substituting Eqs.(13-14) 
 4
anisotropy of composite laminates due to different ply 
angles stacking play an important role in antenna 
performance. 
It is obvious that microstrip antennas embedded 
in composite laminates have different and various 
performance compared with those on isotropic 
substrates.  The difference between the mechanical 
properties in symmetric and asymmetric laminates 
will not be “transferable” to their electromagnetic 
properties.  The results show that the substrate 
properties, both anisotropy ratio and stacking 
sequence, are critical to performance.  Without the 
electromagnetic model developed in this research, 
such analyses would have been impossible up to the 
present.  Furthermore, Eqs.(55) and (56) give the 
similar matrix forms as those of composite mechanics 
[21].  The similarities are listed in Table 2 and it is 
interesting that electromagnetic wave propagation in 
spectral domain give the similar matrix forms as 
mechanical wave in space domain.
