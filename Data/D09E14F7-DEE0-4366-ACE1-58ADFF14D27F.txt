1. Abstract
Gas absorption by a moving liquid
aerosol is frequently encountered in both the
environment and industries. For instance,
when one is concerned with the formations of
acid fog and acid rain as well as air pollutants
scrubbed by spray towers, the basic transport
mechanisms are mass transfer between an
aerosol droplet and its environment. For
aerosols moving in the atmosphere or mists
generated from sprays, the particles motion is
likely to pertain to varying-velocity. To
recognize the uptake characteristics of air
pollutants or greenhouse gases by aerosols
with varying velocity, the absorption
dynamics in moving droplets under the
influence of drag force are investigated
numerically. A single water droplet will be
taken into account, while the gas of HCl is
considered. An examination of the mass
transfer inside the droplet, a maximum
distribution in concentration difference
between the droplet surface and the internal
minimum concentration is exhibited.
Meanwhile, gaseous scavenging behavior is
apparently characterized by the droplet.
Regarding the effect of the decelerating
motion, the predictions reveal that the
variation of the droplet velocity due to drag
force is faster than that of the uptake process.
Therefore, the absorption rates of the
decelerating droplet are substantially
decreased when compared with that of a
droplet without drag force. As a whole,
increasing initial Reynolds number causes
faster decay in the droplet velocity which
further reduces the mass transfer rate in the
aqueous phase. This suggests that the larger
the initial Reynolds number, the more
significant the absorption rate of the droplet
affected by the drag force.
Keywords: moving aerosol; absorption; air
pollutants; spray tower.

運動氣膠於運動狀態下吸收氣體是
自然界及工程界常遭遇到的物理現象，例
如大氣中酸雨的形成過程及環境工程中常

膠內質量輸送現象，本計畫乃以數值方法
模擬單一對流氣膠的吸收過程，其中單一
氣膠係由一球形水滴所組成，而氣相溶質
則考慮HCl氣體的質量傳輸過程。研究結果
顯示，溶質於氣膠表面及內部之濃度差呈
現一最大值之分佈，此外，氣相之掃氣現
象十分明顯。至於減速運動對於吸收之效

明顯較無減速運動氣膠為慢。整體而言，
3phase. To establish baseline conditions for
study, gaseous hydrogen chloride absorbed
by liquid droplets with drag force will be
simulated first, in which three moderate
initial Reynolds numbers are considered. The
mass transfer in the gas phase will be
observed as well to account for the gaseous
scavenging characteristics. Later, the mass
transfer and uptake characteristics of the
particles associated with deceleration are
compared with that in the absence of drag
force. Eventually, the practical design of wet
scrubber is suggested in accordance with the
presently obtained results.
3. Results and discussion
Conventionally, when the motion of a
droplet is considered, the Lagrangian
framework is applied to track the path or
trajectory of the moving particle. However,
seeing that the mass transfer phenomena in
the vicinity of the droplet are closely related
to the two-phase fluid motion, the Eulerian
framework rather than the Lagrangian one is
used in the present study. That is, the
reference frame is fixed to the droplet and the
origin of the coordinate system is located at
the droplet center. On the other hand, to
facilitate solving the physical problem, the
assumptions of the study include: (1) the
two-phase flow fields are laminar and
axisymmetric; (2) the droplet is spherical; (3)
mass diffusion in the two phases obeysFick’s
law; (4) phase equilibrium (Henry’s law)
prevails at the interface; and (5) the body
force of the droplet as well as the influence of
droplet-droplet interaction on the single
droplet absorption are ignored.
The relevant governing equations
consist of the gas-phase and liquid-phase
conservation equations of continuity,
momentum, and species. It should be
mentioned that in the present study the solute
concentration and pressure at the upstream
far field are assumed to be uniform and
invariant with time. In the current study, two
sets of governing equations are encountered.
The two-phase simulation method (TPSM)
developed previously [9] is applied to
simulate the mass transfer dynamics in which
numerical validation and stability have been
performed rigorously. However, in addition
to the original method, on account of
considering the impact of the drag force, the
present numerical technique further takes the
deceleration effect into account. Because the
droplet is postulated to be stationary and a
convective flow passes over the droplet, a
reversed D’Alembert force due to the drag
force on the droplet is applied to the
gas-phase flow field [10]. That is, the droplet
deceleration is calculated in terms of drag
force and then the deceleration is used to
adjust the far-field velocity at each time step.
When the droplet Reynolds number is in the
range of 2 to 500, the droplet drag coefficient
can be represented by

5period. With increasing time, in view of the
deceleration of the droplet motion, the
vortices progressively wither and eventually
disappear. Contrary to the distributions of the
relative Reynolds number, the drag
coefficients tend to rise with increasing time,
as a consequence of decreased relative
velocity. In addition, a lower initial Reynolds
number, say, Re0=50, will lead to a higher
profile of drag coefficient. Regarding the
streamline distributions in the droplets, the
double-vortex structures (viz., the primary
vortex and the secondary vortex) develop
initially for the cases of Re0=100 and 200.
The double-vortex elicited is due to the
excitation of the recirculation vortex at the
rear region of the droplet [15]. A recirculation
vortex is also induced initially for Re0=50.
However, the strength of the vortex is too
small to counteract the inertial force of the
primary vortex, the single vortex rather than
the double-vortex is thus exhibited. With
regard to the case of Re0=100, the vortex
bifurcation phenomenon persists from 0.0193
to 0.4183 ms, whereas it exists when the
exposure time is from 0.0064 and 3.5076 ms
for Re0=200. This suggests that the sustaining
period of the secondary vortex at Re0=200 is
much longer than that at Re0=100.

and droplet transport number dTr at the
three initial Reynolds numbers are presented
in Fig. 2. Physically, the Sherwood number
stands for the concentration gradient or mass
flux at the interface. The vortex velocity is
used to account for vortex strength in the
droplet. On the other hand, under the
situation of high strength internal circulation,
the characteristic time ratio between mass
diffusion and internal circulation can be
denoted by Tr/36 [7]. It is noted in Fig. 2a
that the mean Sherwood number declines
significantly soon after the droplet is injected
into the flow. This is because that the droplet
surface concentration rises rapidly in the
initial period, thereby retarding the interfacial
mass flux. On the other hand, in examining
the distributions of 'vu (Fig. 2b) and Tr/36
(Fig. 2c), it is noteworthy that the curves are
characterized by the maximum distributions.
Basically, there are two forces in determining
the vortex velocity. The first factor is the
7time (see Fig. 1b), the droplet absorption rate
impeded by the deceleration is more and
more significant with time. For example,
when the absorption time is 16 ms,
corresponding to Re0=50, 100 and 200 the
ratios are approximately 0.84, 0.80, and 0.79,
respectively.

Fig. 3. Temporal variations of (a) droplet
absorption amount with and without drag
force as well as (b) their ratio at Re0=50, 100,
and 200.
Eventually, two characteristic times of
half-velocity period (t1/2,u) and
half-absorption period (t1/2,m) as well as their
ratio for the initial Reynolds number ranging
from 30 to 200 are presented in Fig. 4. Time
required for the relative velocity or Re/Re0
reaching 0.5 is defined as the half-velocity
period; similarly, the half-absorption period
is identified as the solute accumulation
amount in the droplet is equivalent to 0.5. It
has been illustrated that a higher initial
Reynolds number is conducive to
transporting the solute in the droplet while
the droplet velocity decreases faster. Thus it
is not surprising that both the t1/2,u and t1/2,m
decay monotonically with increasing Re0.
However, from Fig. 4 we also observe that
the time ratio varies from 0.53 to 0.46. In
other words, the droplet velocity decay
process is faster than the droplet absorption
one. It follows that the characteristic time of
droplet motion is comparable to that of mass
transfer. It is thus concluded that the mass
transfer phenomenon of a moving droplet is
deeply affected by the drag force in the
course of deceleration.
As far as wet scrubbers are concerned,
it is known that the design of the scrubbers
depends strongly on the characteristic time of
mass transfer between the gas phase and the
liquid phase. Specifically, the residence time
of droplets in spray chamber should be larger
than the absorption time of the droplets such
that the mass transfer (or air pollutants uptake)
can be sufficiently achieved. In this aspect,
the present study has provided a fundamental
and practical insight into the design of the
wet scrubbers. For example, for a
100μm-diameter droplet without drag force,
when the droplet Reynolds number is 100,
the relative velocity of the droplet is 15.54
m/s. Our predictions indicate that the time
required for the droplet reaching the saturated

Energy utilization plays an important role in the progresses of industry. According to a
recent study concerning energy resources and global development, it was reported that crude
oil, natural gas, and uranium are likely to be exhausted in the future 30 to 60 years, based on
annual 2000 energy consumption. In contrast, coal can still be utilized for two hundred years.
Therefore, it is anticipated that the role played by coal in future energy supply will become
more and more compelling. Conventionally, coal was pulverized and consumed via direct
combustion in large-scale utility furnaces for generating electric power, but its efficiency is
relatively low. Besides, on account of growing concerns upon emissions of air pollutants and
greenhouse gas (viz., CO2) from pulverized-coal power plants, it has greatly stimulated the
study of clean coal technology. Reviewing recently developed methods of the clean coal
technology, because the efficiencies integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) are much
higher than those from coal-fired power plants, the IGCC has received a great deal of
attention. Moreover, the environmental impact from the pollutant emissions of the IGCC can
also be reduced to a great extent, as a consequence of treating produced syngas prior to
burning it.
To recognize the syngas formation and combustion characteristics, an integrated
experiment is conducted in the present study. In the coal gasification and syngas combustion
system, it can roughly be divided into a fixed-bed gasifier, a burner, a gas treatment unit, gas
measurement equipments, and a reaction recorder. The gasifier (or reactor) is constructed
from a tube of stainless steel. The reaction temperature is controlled by a control box. A hot
spark is provided by the burner so as to check the ignitability of the product gas. The burner
enables us to observe syngas formation and combustion processes. Previous to measuring the
product gas, the syngas will undergo a series of unit operations, including cooling, water bath,
filtration, and drying, to remove tars, particular matters, and moisture contained in the syngas
and avoid damaging equipments. Subsequently, a gas chromatography (GC) and a gas

Abstract
An integrated experiment is conducted in the present study to recognize the syngas
formation and combustion characteristics. In the coal gasification and syngas combustion
system, it can roughly be divided into a fixed-bed gasifier, a burner, a gas treatment unit, gas
measurement equipments, and a reaction recorder. In the experiment, 50g coal particles are
selected as a sample in each run. When the reaction temperature was 1000℃, it was observed
that, following the feeding of the coal into the reactor, just a bit of gas was emitted from the
burner. According to the syngas combustion, the entire gasification process can be partitioned
into five periods; they are initiated, growing, rapidly decaying, progressively decaying, and
frozen periods, sequentially. Moreover, seeing that the flame length at t=4 min was about 30
times of that at t=26 min, it suggests the gasification strength in the initial period was much
higher that that near extinction.
