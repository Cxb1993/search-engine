Abstract 
This study aims at modeling isothermal profiles of an aquifer thermal extraction (ATE) system 
which contains a single pumping well.  The aquifer is confined and its overlying and underlying 
rocks have different geophysical properties and thicknesses.  A mathematical model based on the 
advection-conduction equation is developed to simulate the ATE system.  The model consists of the 
horizontal advection, thermal conduction along a water flow direction within the aquifer, and vertical 
thermal conduction within the rocks.  The semi-analytical solution in dimensionless form is derived 
using Laplace-transform technique and its corresponding time-domain result is evaluated by the 
modified Crump method.  The simulation results show that the change of geothermal in an ATE 
system depends on the aquifer thickness, the geophysical properties of the aquifer and rocks, and the 
outer boundary conditions of the rocks and operating time.  The present solution can be used as a 
preliminary tool for designing the heat extraction facility in an ATE system.

temperature, Tm, is defined as approximate 
extracted temperature which is located 0.1 m 
from the center of pumping well.  
The predicted temperature profiles of 
aquifer temperature versus radial distance r are 
shown in Fig. 2 for various operating time 
(namely, t = 102, 103, 104, 105 days, or 
steady-state).  This figure shows that the 
aquifer temperature generally decreases with 
operating time near the pumping well.  The Tm 
decreases from initial temperature of 70 oC to 70, 
69.6, 55.9 and 49 oC when operating time is 102, 
103, 104 and 105 days, respectively.  The aquifer 
temperatures differs 0.4 oC between at 102 days 
and at 103 days before r ≤ 20 m and matches 
after r > 20 m.  Under the same operating time, 
the aquifer temperature increases with radial 
distance.  The result shows that the aquifer 
temperature maintenances constant after r = 300 
m and the Tm is 70 to 70 oC, 69.6 to 69.8oC, 55.9 
to 63 oC and 49 to 59.5 oC at t = 102, 103, 104 and 
105 days, respectively when the radial distances 
range from 0.1 m to 103 m.  This figure also 
shows that the aquifer temperature of the 
transient solution is almost identical to that of 
the steady-state solution at t = 105 days.  The 
relative difference in aquifer temperature 
between the steady-state solution and the 
transient solution at t = 105 days is about 0.056 
%. 
4. Concluding Remarks 
A conceptual model is developed in an ATE 
system to simulate thermal distribution when hot 
water is extracted from the confined aquifer.  
Semi-analytical solutions of dimensionless 
temperature distribution within the aquifer and 
its underlying and overlying rocks have been 
presented.  The time-domain results are 
evaluated numerically using the modified Crump 
method with accuracy to the fourth decimal.  In 
addition, the steady-state solution is also 
provided in this paper.  The analyzed results 
have revealed several important points.  A 
larger aquifer thickness, geothermal gradients, 
and/or outer temperature of the rocks yield a 
larger extraction temperature in an ATE system.    
The steady-state solution matches with the 
transient solution when the operating period is 
about after 105 days.  In addition, the rock 
temperature distribution is affected by heat 
transfer coefficient appreciably only near the 
lower and upper boundaries of the rocks. 
The present solutions can be applied to 
assess the effects of thermal properties, aquifer 
thickness, outer temperature of the rocks and 
heat transfer coefficient, and operating time on 
the spatial and temporal temperature 
distributions of the aquifer and adjacent rocks in 
an ATE system.  These solutions have practical 
use in designing an efficient ATE system for a 
great quantity hot water extracted from a 
confined aquifer as electric power and spring 
development.

INTRODUCTION 
Heat extraction from geothermal energy resources such as an aquifer thermal 
extraction (ATE) system becomes an attractive way to obtain heat energy recently.  Thus, 
it is necessary to understand the heat transfer mechanics and extraction effectiveness in an 
ATE system.  The ATE system provides an economic way to obtain heat energy for 
demand.  Hot water can be extracted through pumping well and attained heat energy from 
geological formation.  The heat extraction effectiveness and storage efficiency of an ATE 
system depend on heat losses through interface, extraction wellbore, and thermal 
conduction. 
Sauty et al. (1982a) presented a theoretical study on the thermal behavior of aquifer 
storage for hot water.  A finite difference model was used to calculate well temperature 
distribution during production periods.  Furthermore, Sauty et al. (1982b) performed some 
field experiments of hot water storage and compared the experiment data with theoretical 
results of Sauty et al. (1982a).  Tenma et al. (2003) presented a model to examine the 
design of thermal storage systems in exploring low-temperature geothermal resources and 
evaluated the sensitive parameters including the well distance, well depth, and flow rate.  
The FEHM (Finite Element Heat and Mass transfer) code developed by Zyvoloski et al. 
(1997) was also used to simulate heat and mass transfers in a porous medium.  Tenma et 
al. (2008) conducted the field tests at Hijiori hot dry rock (HDR) system, Japan, to asses 
  18
The objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual model and related analytical 
solution for predicting thermal behavior in an ATE system after extracting hot water from a 
geothermal confined aquifer.  The model considers that the pumping well fully penetrates 
the aquifer which is underlain and overlain by the rocks of finite thickness with different 
physical properties and geothermal gradients in the vertical direction.  Outer boundaries of 
the overlying and underlying rocks are represented by the Robin boundary condition.  
Heat energy is partially captured from the aquifer and partially transferred by means of 
adjacent rocks to water flow.  The solution in dimensionless form is derived using Laplace 
transforms and its corresponding results in time domain are computed by the modified 
Crump method (Crump, 1976; de Hoog et al., 1982).  The present solution can be applied 
to simulate transient temperature distributions in an ATE system and to assess the 
influences of geological parameters as well as thermal properties on temperature 
distribution.

Steady-state Solution 
The steady-state solution of dimensionless aquifer temperature can be obtained from 
Eq. (13) by applying the Tauberian theorem (Yeh and Wang, 2007).  The derivation for 
the steady-state solution of dimensionless aquifer temperature is shown in Appendix B and

where 24w=λ .  The evaluation of Eq. (25) is tedious and laborious.  The Shanks 
method is adopted to accelerate the evaluation of infinite sum in this equation.  This 
method had been successfully applied to efficiently compute the solutions arisen in 
  26
at t = 103, 6×103, 104 and 6×104 day as well as under steady-state condition.  This figure 
shows that the Tm changes with operating time.  Under the same operating time, the Tm 
increases slightly near the well, significantly at a radial distance ranging from 10 m to 200 
m, and then approaches a constant at r ≥ 200 m.  The result shows that the extracted 
temperature (Tw) is 69.9 oC, 61.4 oC, 55.8 oC and 49.1 oC at t = 103, 6×103, 104 and 6×104 
day, respectively.  In addition, the Tm has constant values after r = 10, 20, 100, and 200 m, 
respectively, at t = 103, 6×103, 104 and 6×104 day.  This figure also shows that the 
transient solution approaches the steady-state solution when t = 6×104 day. 
Figure 4 shows the extracted temperature (Tw) versus operating time for aquifer 
thicknesses bm = 10 m and 100 m and different geothermal gradients, a1 and a2, of the 
underlying and overlying rocks, respectively.  When a1 = a2 = 0 oC/m (no geothermal 
gradient), a larger aquifer thickness yields a higher Tw for time ranging from 103 to 6×104 
day.  It shows that the Tw is significantly affected by bm due to dominant ρc (thermal 
capacity) per unit thickness during operating time (say 103 < t < 6×104 days).  In addition, 
the Tw approaches identical for two bm cases (t < 103 days or t > 6×104 days).  For the a1 = 
0.03 oC/m and a2 = 0.06 oC/m case, it produces different temperature curves of Tw which 
separates two sections for two bm.  In the first section, a smaller aquifer thickness yields a 
higher Tw.  It indicates that the thermal transfer at interface of aquifer and rocks is changes 
quickly in a small bm.  A larger aquifer thickness yields a higher Tw in the second section.  
  28
30 oC.  Then a larger aquifer thickness yields a higher Tw in the second section.  It also 
presents that the Tw approaches constant as 49.1 oC and 60.6 oC at t ≥ 6×104 days, 
respectively of the T20 is 30 oC or 50 oC.  The impact of outer surface temperature on 
aquifer temperature is significant after operating time from 103 to 6×104 day. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
A conceptual model is developed in an ATE system to simulate thermal distribution 
when hot water is extracted from a confined aquifer.  Semi-analytical solutions of 
dimensionless temperature distribution within the aquifer and the underlying and overlying 
rocks have been presented.  The time-domain results are evaluated numerically by the 
modified Crump method with accuracy to the fourth decimal.  In addition, the steady-state 
solution is also provided in this paper.  The analyzed results have revealed several 
important points.  The effects of the aquifer thickness, geothermal gradient, and outer 
temperature of the rocks on the extracted temperature are significant in ATE systems.  The 
transient solution matches with the steady-state solution when the operating period is after 
about 6×104 day.  In addition, the rock temperature distribution is affected by heat transfer 
coefficient appreciably only near the lower and upper boundaries of the rocks. 
The present solution can be applied to assess the effects of thermal properties, aquifer 
thickness, geothermal gradient, outer surfaces temperature of the rocks, and heat transfer
