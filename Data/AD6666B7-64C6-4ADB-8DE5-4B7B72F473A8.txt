Abstract 
 
The effects of pore size and surface coating on the humidity sensing behaviors of 
nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) are studied.  The size of the nanopores 
can be manipulated (widened) through etching procedures.  The chosen coating 
material for the AAO surface is zinc oxide (ZnO), which is deposited using atomic 
layer deposition (ALD) method.  The sensing responses of the AAO humidity 
sensors are strongly affected by their surface properties and the measuring frequency.  
At the measuring frequencies of 1 to 5 kHz, the un-coated AAO sensors with average 
pore diameters of 38 to 64 nm exhibit better sensitivities than at other measuring 
frequencies.  The fully-ZnO-coated AAO sensors also show good sensitivities under 
identical operating conditions.  However, the impedance behaviors of the two 
sensing systems are slightly different.  The effect of piezoelectric vibration on the 
adsorbed water layer at the AAO surface is also investigated by electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  This is achieved by building a composite structure 
consisting of an AAO layer and a piezoelectric ceramic layer.  It is found that the 
piezoelectric vibration changes the conduction mechanism at high relative humilities 
with low EIS measuring frequencies.  In contrast, at low relative humilities, the 
impedance increases with the piezoelectric vibration regardless of the EIS measuring 
frequency.  It is believed that at a low relative humility, the piezoelectric vibration 
mainly repels part of the adsorbed water layer at the AAO surface, producing an 
impedance Cole-Cole curve similar to that of a lower relative humility under no 
piezoelectric vibration.

1. Introduction 
 
One of the important oxide-based nanostructure materials for humidity sensing is 
the nanoporous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO).  The existence of the adsorbed water 
layers on the surface of AAO reduces the surface impedance due to the increase in 
ionic conductivity.  AAO has a self-ordered structure with the pore diameter ranging 
from dozen to hundred nanometers.  Because of its large specific surface area, AAO 
is particularly suitable for humidity sensing applications [1-5].  The electrical 
properties of the ceramic surface undergo changes due to the water adsorption process 
can be divided into four stages [6-8]: (a) gaseous water molecules are adsorbed on the 
metal oxide surface, (b) a water molecule is chemisorbed on an available site to form 
 3
surfaces to facilitate the impedance characterization.  All impedance measurements 
were carried out inside an environmental chamber (Model FK5461, World Test 
Technology, Taiwan) at room temperature and relative humidities (RH) ranging from 
40% to 95%.  Specific inductance-capacitance-resistance (LCR) equivalent circuits 
were developed to model the impedance-vs.-frequency behaviors of various AAO 
surfaces.  The simulated results, including the values of resistance, reactance and 
phase angle etc., were checked against the experimental data. 
A stacking composite structure consisting of an AAO layer and a piezoelectric 
layer was constructed to study the controllability of hydrophilicity of the AAO surface.  
A poled piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramic thin disc (30 mm in 
diameter, 0.5 mm in thickness, d33 ≈ 400 pC/N) and was then glued onto the side of 
the AAO specimen which was not anodized (i.e., still an aluminium surface) to form 
the composite structure.  The optical images of the AAO-PZT composite structure 
are shown in Fig. 3.  The impedance behaviors of the AAO surface of the composite 
structure at different RH values and with or without the influence of piezoelectric 
vibration were investigated by identical methods described in the previous paragraph.  
When the piezoelectric vibration was applied, the PZT thin disc was excited at the 
resonant frequency of the AAO-PZT composite structure with an exciting voltage of 
0.5-2 V.  The resonant frequency of the composite structure was determined by the 
impedance analyzer. 
 
3. Measurements and discussion 
 
Fig. 4 compares the microstructures of the un-widened, pore-widened (with 50 
min etching) and ZnO-coated AAO surfaces.  It is evident that the morphologies of 
the three surfaces are very different.  From the impedance characterization, the 
measured Cole-Cole plots of the un-widened AAO specimen are shown in Fig. 5 (for 
RH at 40% to 65%) and Fig. 6 (for RH at 70% to 95%).  It is evident that all the 
Cole-Cole curves exhibit a similar pattern.  The area under the curve decreases with 
increasing RH.  Each curve consists of a semicircle and a straight tail rising away 
from the origin.  Such behavior can be modeled by two RC parallel circuits which 
would generate two semicircles in the Cole-Cole plot.  Notice that the observed 
rising tail at low measuring frequencies could be modeled as a distorted semicircle 
with a large radius of curvature.  When the RH value increases, the radii of both 
semicircles reduce.  From the impedance characterization, the measured Bode plots 
of the un-widened AAO specimen are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 (for RH at 70% to 95%).  
The Bode curves confirm the impedance evolution observed in the Cole-Cole plots.  
At high measuring frequencies (about 104–105 Hz), the observed arcing (semicircle) 
 5
decreasing RH.  When the piezoelectric vibration is applied at the resonant 
frequency of the composite structure, the impedance at high RH values and high 
measuring frequencies is not altered (i.e., semicircle with a similar radius); however, 
at low measuring frequencies, the impedance is sharply increased and the Cole-Cole 
curve is now dominated by the uprising tail.  This indicates that the piezoelectric 
vibration changes the conduction mechanism at high RH values with low measuring 
frequencies.  It is believed that the transportation of light-weight charge carrier H+ 
within the upper water layers at high RH between the electrodes is disturbed by the 
mechanical vibration.  Such disturbance is particularly evident when the frequency 
of the driving electric field for the charge carrier (i.e., the measuring frequency) is low.  
Figs. 15 and 16 show that when the amplitude of the mechanical vibration is increased, 
the uprising tail at low measuring frequencies is further elongated, indicating the 
increasing difficulty in charge transportation. 
In contrast, at low RH values, the impedance increases with the piezoelectric 
vibration regardless of the range of the measuring frequency (see Figs. 17 and 18).  
It is believed that at a low RH, the piezoelectric vibration mainly repels part of the 
adsorbed water layer at the AAO surface, producing an impedance curve similar to 
that of a lower RH under no piezoelectric vibration.  The repulsion of adsorbed 
water is proved by the capacitance measurement of the AAO surface at low RH (see 
Fig. 19 and 20).  The capacitance of the AAO surface is decreased with increasing 
voltage amplitude of the piezoelectric vibration, indicating the repulsion of water.  It 
is interesting to see that at RH of 60% and with 1 V piezoelectric vibration, the 
impedance at low measuring frequencies is specifically low, rendering the Cole-Cole 
plot becoming a D-shape curve (see blue curve in Fig. 18).  This behavior indicates 
that the transportation of heavy charge carrier H3O+ at low RH between the electrodes 
is promoted by the mechanical vibration.  Such promotion is particularly evident 
when the frequency of the driving electric field for the charge carrier (i.e., the 
measuring frequency) is low. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
Research data obtained in study shows that the humidity sensing behaviors of the 
AAO surfaces depend on the on the (1) pore diameter, (2) surface properties, (3) type 
of material and (4) measuring frequency.  The AAO surface exhibits over 2-3 orders 
of magnitude in impedance difference from RH 40% to RH 95%.  The ZnO-coated 
AAO surface exhibits different impedance responses when varying humidity.  
However, they could still be simulated using the developed equivalent circuit model.  
Another key factor in AAO humidity sensing is the measuring frequency.  It is found

The meeting at Oxnard, USA was a success.  International scholars and researchers in the field of 
ceramic smart materials were very interested in the intricate electro-straining behaviors of Mn-doped 
BNBK lead-free ferroelectric ceramics.  There were lots of discussions on the strain hysteresis 
characterization and possible actuating applications of the lead-free ceramics.  People were surprised to 
see that to each increasing step in Mn doping level, there was a marked similarity in the evolutions of the 
induced electrostrain and rhombohedral phase content.  Discussions on the possible staining 
mechanisms were carried out.  Overall, this was a highly productive and worthwhile conference trip.  
The conference proceeding is attached below.

ABSTRACT 
The strain hystereses of lead-free a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-
bBaTiO3-c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (abbrev. as BNBK 100a/100b/100c) 
ferroelectric compositions inside and outside the morphotropic 
phase boundary (MPB) are investigated.  It is found that 
BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, a composition well within the MPB, 
possesses notable actuating properties such as an induced 
electrostrain of about 0.14% and an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1.  
BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 is further doped with various amounts of 
manganese (Mn) to improve its sinterability and ferroelectric 
characteristics.  Intricate hysteresis behaviors are observed 
upon Mn doping.  The total induced electrostrain of BNBK 
85.4/2.6/12 in the 33-directon decreases dramatically from 0.14 
to 0.05% when 0.2 mol% of Mn is introduced into the 
composition.  It then recovers sharply as the Mn doping 
amount is increased progressively to 0.5 and then to 1.0 mol%.  
However, when the doping amount is further increased above 
1.0 mol%, a significant decrease in electrostrain is observed 
again.  The hysteresis data indicate that an electrostrain above 
0.1% can be maintained when the Mn doping amount is in 
between 0.5-1.5 mol%.  Once outside this doping range, the 
induced electrostrain is considerably smaller.  By examining 
the evolution of crystalline phase composition with Mn doping, 
the mole content of rhombohedral phase is shown to be a 
critical factor in deciding the straining behaviors of the Mn-
doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 ceramics.  To each increasing step 
in Mn doping level, there is a marked similarity in the 
evolutions of the induced electrostrain and rhombohedral phase 
content. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
There has been a determined effort to develop lead-free 
ferroelectric ceramics of high piezoelectric properties by 
various doping and alloying routes, and several lead-free 
ceramic systems have shown great potentials.  Saito et al. 
have developed a highly <001> textured alkaline niobate-based 
perovskite polycrystal with a piezoelectric charge coefficient 
d33 of 416 pCN-1, which is widely regarded as the closest lead-
free system to the actuator-grade hard and semi-hard lead 
zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics to date [1].  Utilizing a 
reversible domain switching mechanism caused by the 
symmetry-conforming property of point defects, Ren and co-
workers demonstrated up to 0.17% of nonlinear recoverable 
electrostrains on hybrid-doped barium titanate (BaTiO3) and 
acceptor-doped potassium niobate (KNbO3)-based ceramics 
[2,3].  A considerable literature also exists concerning the 
dielectric, piezoelectric and doping characteristics of two 
bismuth sodium titanate (BNT)-based ceramic solid solutions: 
(1-x)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-xBaTiO3 (BNT-BT; abbrev. as BNBT-
100x) and (1-y)(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-y(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (BNT-BKT; 
abbrev. as BNKT-100y) [4-8].  These two BNT-based solid 
solutions have rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase 
boundary (MPB) compositions existed on x = 0.06-0.07 for 
BNBT-100x and y = 0.16-0.20 for BNKT-100y [7-9].  
Furthermore, based on these two solid solutions, a ternary 
system, a(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-bBaTiO3-c(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 (BNT-BT-
BKT; abbrev. as BNBK 100a/100b/100c), can be developed [9-
11].  Within the MPB region, compositions of the BNBK 
ternary system typically exhibit more balance between their 
ferroelectric and temperature properties in comparison with the 
compositions of the BNBT and BNKT systems [5,9-11].  It is 
agreed by the majority of the lead-free research community that 
to replace PZT-based systems, it is necessary that the required 
dielectric, piezoelectric and/or ferroelectric properties for 
various applications are identified, and suitable lead-free 
systems are developed for each application [12,13]. 
The aim of the present study is to investigate the straining 
characteristics of the BNBK family of lead-free ferroelectric

relatively unchanged, ε33,total decreases progressively as the 
composition shifts away from the MPB BNBK 6.5-20 into the 
rhombohedral phase, which is achieved by increasing the 
amount of BNT in the BNBK system.  Figure 2 shows that 
MPB compositions BNBK 6.5-18 and BNBK 6-20, which 
contain more BNT than BNBK 6.5-20, exhibit smaller 
electrostrains.  A similar trend to ε33,total is also observed for 
the apparent d33, obtained from the slope gradient of the 
butterfly curve at zero electric field. 
With a composition well within the MPB, BNBK 6.5-20 
exhibits an ε33,total of about 0.14%, more than double than that 
of BNBK 7-20 which situates at the tetragonal boundary of the 
MPB.  The apparent d33 of BNBK 6.5-20 is 295 pCN-1, an 
impressive number for a lead-free ferroelectric ceramic.  
Figure 2 shows that the heavily BNT-based rhombohedral 
BNBK 90/5/5 displays a much higher ε33,total than the tetragonal 
BNBK 75/5/20.  However, the magnitude of strain produced 
by BNBK 90/5/5 is still no match for those produced by the 
compositions well within the MPB.  BNBK 6.5-20, which can 
also be denoted as BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, has been identified to 
possess notable actuating properties.  It is therefore chosen as 
the base composition for the study of Mn doping effect on the 
straining characteristics.

Straining of Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 
Five different Mn doping amounts, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 
2.0 mol%, are chosen for the present study.  The stable strain 
ε-E hysteresis curves for the Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 
ceramics, measured at a cyclic electric field of amplitude ±5.0 
MVm-1, a frequency of 0.2 Hz and sinusoidal waveform, are 
shown in Fig. 3.  The measured strain hystereses suggest an 
intricate straining behavior – ε33,total first decreases dramatically 
from 0.14 to 0.05% when 0.2 mol% of Mn is introduced into 
the composition.  It then recovers quickly as the Mn doping 
amount is increased progressively to 0.5 and then to 1.0 mol%.  
In comparison with pure BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, the 1.0 mol% Mn-
doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 ceramic exhibits a similar ε33,total and 
a noticeably higher εr.  As the Mn doping amount is further 
increased to 1.5 and then to 2.0 mol%, ε33,total does not keep on 
increasing but rather decreases sharply again.  For the 2.0 
mol% Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 ceramic, a low ε33,total of 
0.055% is observed.  A similar trend to ε33,total is also observed 
for the apparent d33.  From the strain hysteresis data, the 
values of ε33,total of various Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 
ceramics are listed in Table 1.  It is evident from Table 1 that 
Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 could maintain a strain level 
above 0.1% when the Mn doping amount is in between 0.5-1.5 
mol%.  Once outside this doping range, the magnitude of 
induced electrostrain is considerably smaller.

In the previous section, it is shown that for a tetragonal 
BNBK composition, a significant rise in its ε33,total and apparent 
d33 could be achieved by moving the tetragonal composition 
into the MPB, but without it becoming fully rhombohedral.  In 
other words, possessing a “suitable” amount of rhombohedral 
phase in the crystalline structure seems to be the key to 
superior actuating properties for the BNBK family of ceramics.  
This particular notion is critical since the intricate straining

From the simulated peaks, the mole content of 
rhombohedral phase (MR) can be obtained using the following 
equation: 
 
MR = Area (202)R / (Area (202)R + Area (200)T + Area (002)T), 
 
where “Area (…)” is the relative area under a specific 
simulated peak.  Table 1 lists the deconvolution results and 
the calculated MR values for the Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 
ceramics.  It is evident that with increasing Mn doping, the 
evolution of MR is analogous to that of ε33,total.  When 0.2 
mol% of Mn is introduced into pure BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, MR 
decreases considerably from 72% to 33%.  It then moves 
upward sharply as the Mn doping amount is further increased 
to 0.5 and then to 1.0 mol% (e.g., MR = 84% at 1.0 mol% Mn 
doping).  However, as the Mn doping amount is further 
increased above 1.0 mol%, MR starts to decrease again. 
Both the experimental and simulated results indicate that to 
each increasing step in Mn doping level, even though the 
magnitudes of increase or decrease in ε33,total and MR are not 
identical, the evolutions of ε33,total and MR are clearly alike.  
Due to the errors inherent in the peak-fitting procedure, a 
certain level of discrepancy between the magnitudes of changes 
in ε33,total and MR is expected.  Nevertheless, based on the 
peak-fitting results and the measured strain hystereses, it is 
evident that the mole content of rhombohedral phase is a 
critical factor in deciding the straining behaviors of the Mn-
doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 ceramics.  In comparison with the 
tetragonal phase, the rhombohedral phase possesses more 
equivalent crystallographic directions for non-180° polarization 
switching.  It is therefore no surprise that the Mn-doped 
BNBK compositions with relatively higher MR exhibit larger 
electrostrains.  A fully rhombohedral BNBK composition 
though would exhibit a limited strain since it has deviated from 
the MPB and lost the contribution of the 90° switching from 
the tetragonal phase.  The present study demonstrates that the 
actuating properties of BNT-based lead-free ferroelectric 
ceramics can be effectively manipulated by tailoring their 
crystalline phase compositions. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
In summary, the straining characteristics of the MPB 
compositions of the (Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3-BaTiO3-(Bi0.5K0.5)TiO3 
lead-free system have been investigated.  It is found that 
BNBK 85.4/2.6/12, a composition well within the MPB, 
possesses notable actuating properties such as an induced 
electrostrain of about 0.14% and an apparent d33 of 295 pCN-1.  
BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 is further doped with various amounts of 
Mn to improve its sinterability and ferroelectric characteristics.  
Intricate hysteresis behaviors are observed upon Mn doping – 
an electrostrain above 0.1% can be maintained when the Mn 
doping amount is in between 0.5-1.5 mol%.  Once outside this 
doping range, the induced electrostrain is considerably smaller.  
By examining the evolution of crystalline phase composition 
with Mn doping, the mole content of rhombohedral phase is 
shown to be a critical factor in deciding the straining behaviors 
of the Mn-doped BNBK 85.4/2.6/12 ceramics.  To each 
increasing step in Mn doping level, there is a marked similarity 
in the evolutions of the induced electrostrain and rhombohedral 
phase content.

EFFECT OF MICROSTRUCTURE ON LIFETIME PERFORMANCE OF BARIUM 
TITANATE CERAMICS UNDER DC AND AC ELECTRIC FIELDS

ABSTRACT 
Bulk barium titanate (BaTiO3) ceramic specimens with 
bimodal microstructures are prepared and their dielectric and 
fatigue strengths are investigated under an alternating current 
(AC) electric field and a direct current (DC) electric field. It is 
found that under AC electrical loading, both the dielectric and 
fatigue strengths decrease with increasing amount of coarse 
abnormal grains. The scatter of the AC fatigue strength is 
characterized with the Weibull statistics. The extent of scatter 
of the AC fatigue strength data correlates strongly with the size 
distribution of the coarse grains. Such correlation is resulted 
from the presence of intrinsic defects within the microstructure. 
For DC electrical loading, the time to failure of the specimens 
with coarse abnormal grains is significantly shorter than the 
lifetimes of the specimens with only small normal grains. It is 
found that under a DC electric field of 6 MVm-1, the BaTiO3 
specimens would fail within 200 h when abnormal grains are 
present in the microstructure. However, the lifetimes of the 
specimens containing abnormal grains vary significantly from 
one to another. The Weibull statistical analysis indicates that 
the amount of abnormal grains has little influence on the 
lifetime performance of bulk BaTiO3 ceramics under large DC 
electric fields. In most of the failed BaTiO3 specimens under 
DC electrical loading, regardless of their lifetimes, large 
through-thickness round holes with recrystallization features 
are present. A mixed failure mode consisting of avalanche and 
thermal breakdowns is proposed for the failed specimens. 
INTRODUCTION 
 With relatively high dielectric constants, barium titanate 
(BaTiO3)-based oxides have been widely adopted as the 
dielectric materials for ceramic capacitors [1]. The application 
of BaTiO3 thin films as the tunnel barriers for ferroelectric 
random access memories (FERAMs) has also been proposed 
[2]. Due to the increasing demand on device miniaturization, 
the required thickness of the dielectric layers in electronic 
components is continuously decreasing. For example, the 
dielectric layer thickness in multilayer ceramic capacitors 
(MLCCs) has now been reduced down to 1 µm and the typical 
tunnel barrier thickness in FERAMs is as small as 2-3 nm [2,3]. 
One of the biggest effects from the ongoing trend of device 
miniaturization is the increase in electric field strength 
experienced by the dielectric layer, resulting in its premature 
failure. A considerable literature currently exists concerning the 
reliability and fatigue behaviors of ferroelectric ceramics under 
alternating current (AC) electric fields [4-12]. In contrast, the 
effect of material makeup, such as the microstructure, on the 
failure behaviors of ferroelectric ceramics under high direct 
current (DC) electric fields has received little attention. 
The microstructure of BaTiO3 is highly sensitive to its 
composition, especially to the Ba/Ti ratio and the amount of 
impurity [13]. A slightly lower than 1 Ba/Ti ratio will induce 
the formation of a liquid phase above the eutectic temperature 
(1312 °C) of BaTiO3-Ba6Ti17O40 [13,14]. The presence of the 
liquid phase could trigger the growth of abnormal grains during 
sintering. A bimodal grain size distribution is thus commonly 
observed in the Ti-rich BaTiO3 specimens. Internal stresses 
within the microstructure are commonly induced when cooling 
through the Curie temperature. Depending on the grain size, the 
resultant residual stresses could initiate spontaneous cracking 
[15]. Based on thermal expansion analyses, the presence of 
abnormal grains within the sintered bulk BaTiO3 ceramics has 
been related to the formation of microstructural defects and 
microcracks [16]. Considering the complexity of the grain 
growth behavior in BaTiO3 and its importance as a dielectric 
material within commercial electronic devices, an examination 
of the relationship between the microstructural features of 
BaTiO3 and its reliability under AC and DC electrical loading is 
indeed necessary. In the present study, bulk BaTiO3 specimens 
with various amounts of coarse abnormal grains are prepared 
and the effect of microstructure on the dielectric strength and 
time to failure of the specimens under AC and DC electric 
fields is investigated.

electrical loading. In terms of degradation in resistivity, the 
numbers of fatigue cycles required for the specimens to exhibit 
a resistivity less than 106 Ω-cm, an electrical condition in 
which the specimens are considered ‘failed’, are summarized in 
Table 1. For the BaTiO3 specimens sintered at 1330 °C for 0.1 
h and 1335 °C for 0.2 h, a resistivity less than 106 Ω-cm has 
not been observed even when the AC fatigue loading reaches 
one million cycles. In contrast, the specimens sintered at 1335 
°C for 2 h and 1350 °C for 2 h have failed within 105 cycles.

The number of cycles for failure under AC loading varies 
not only from one type of specimen to another, but also among 
the same type of specimens. The AC fatigue failure is believed 
to be resulted from the flaws within the specimens, and the 
variation in flaw size underlines the difference in fatigue 
lifetime. The Weibull approach is adopted in the present study 
to characterize the flaw size distribution [17]. The Weibull 
approach is based on the weakest link theory, which assumes 
that failure takes place at the most severe flaw in a given 
volume under a uniform stress. The AC fatigue lifetime data are 
presented in a format of probability of failure, F, versus applied 
stress. F can be expressed as: 
N
nF 5.0−=    (1) 
where n is the nth specimen (specimens are ranked) and N is the 
total number of specimens in the batch. In the present study, 
stresses experienced by the specimen come from the alternating 
electric field. The number of cycles at failure indicates the 
‘survivability’ of the specimen under stress. It is therefore, 
instead of stress, used as the parameter to quantify the fatigue 
failure as following:

representing the extent of scatter, and c is the intercept in the

1ln[ln(

Fig. 2 shows the Weibull distributions for the AC loading 
BaTiO3 specimens sintered at 1335 °C for 2 h and 1350 °C for 
2 h. These two types of specimens possess the Weibull moduli 
of 11 and 3, respectively. Notice that for each sintering 
condition, 20 fatigued specimens are utilized for the Weibull 
analysis. It is evident from Fig. 2 that the Weibull modulus is 
highly influenced by the sintering condition. The coefficient of 
variation (i.e., standard deviation divided by average value) for 
the Weibull modulus depends strongly on the number of 
specimens adopted. As 20 fatigued specimens are used for each 
sintering condition, the coefficient of variation as estimated by 
a Monte Carlo simulation is 0.21 [18]. Such a small relative 
variability indicates that the significant difference between the 
Weibull moduli of the two specimen types is genuine. Based on 
the cycle number at failure, the specimens sintered at 1335 °C 
for 2 h not only display substantially longer fatigue lifetimes 
than the specimens sintered at 15 °C higher, their fatigue 
lifetimes also vary within a much narrower range. This 
suggests that the BaTiO3 specimens with less amount of coarse 
grains have higher reliability, despite they might possess a 
bimodal grain size distribution.

When the AC fatigue test was completed, the ‘failed’ 
BaTiO3 specimen was subjected to a mechanical load until 
separation by fast fracture occurred, through the fatigue crack 
growth zone. This procedure allows the microstructural 
features at the fatigue-induced crack faces to be examined, and 
consequently, facilitates the identification of microstructural 
weak points which are commonly associated with the fatigue 
crack paths. In the present study, a common microstructural 
region that is susceptible to fatigue cracking is where the coarse 
abnormal grains are clustered together. This is clearly 
demonstrated in Fig. 3. The SEM micrographs shown in Fig. 3 
are the fracture surfaces of the BaTiO3 specimen containing 
45% abnormal grains (sintered at 1335 °C for 2 h) before and 
after fatiguing. The electric field-induced fatigue cracks, which 
appear black in the micrograph (see Fig. 3b), are predominantly 
intergranular and propagate through regions where the 
abnormal grains are interconnected to each other. The observed

specimens containing abnormal grains. 
 
The circular surfaces of the failed BaTiO3 specimens under 
DC loading are examined upon removing the silver electrodes. 
A typical top surface (where positive voltage applied) 
micrograph of the failed BaTiO3 specimens under DC loading 
is shown in Fig. 6a. A round hole with a diameter of about 50 
µm is observed. The round hole is believed to be caused by the 
dielectric breakdown and can be observed on the surfaces of 
more than 90% of the failed BaTiO3 specimens under DC 
loading. The cross-sectional micrograph of the hole is shown in 
Fig. 6b. The hole is through-thickness and runs in a direction 
approximately parallel to the direction of the applied DC 
electric field. Fig. 6c shows the interior microstructural features 
of the hole. It is evident that recrystallization occurs inside the 
round hole, indicating that the hole is generated by electrical 
arcing, accompanied by a rapid increase in temperature. Arcing 
would occur if a sufficiently high electric field leads to thermal 
runaway of electron emission sites. While a rapid increase in 
temperature would induce localized melting (and then 
recrystallization) in the microstructure. 
For the BaTiO3 specimens investigated in the present 
study, a mixed failure mode is observed. The DC lifetime data 
indicate that as the amount of abnormal grains is increased, the 
number of specimens with extremely short lifetimes (< 1 s) is 
increased. This suggests an avalanche-like arcing behavior. 
However, in most of the failed BaTiO3 specimens, regardless of 
their lifetimes, the presence of large through-thickness round 
holes with recrystallization features suggests a substantial 
increase in temperature at the breakdown site during DC 
loading, supporting the thermal runaway breakdown 
mechanism. Based on the experimental evidences, it is believed 
that avalanche arcing could occur if a sufficiently large DC 
electric field leads to thermal runaway of electron emission 
sites, such as the silver electrodes or microstructural defects 
which contain trapped electrons.

The experimental data show that the lifetime performance 
of bulk BaTiO3 ceramics under DC electric field loading is 
strongly influenced by the presence of coarse abnormal grains. 
The time to failure is significantly reduced with the formation 
of abnormal grains in the microstructure. Additionally, the large 
size variation of the abnormal grains leads a large scatter in the 
lifetime data. The connection between the DC lifetime and the 
grain features of the BaTiO3 ceramics signifies the importance 
of microstructural control through material processing. It is 
evident that the formation of coarse abnormal grains in the 
BaTiO3 ceramics should be avoided in order to have a quality 
lifetime under DC electrical loading. In the present study, the 
Weibull moduli of the BaTiO3 specimens containing coarse 
abnormal grains vary in a small range from 0.34 to 0.41. The 
difference between the moduli falls within the tolerance of a 
90% confidence level, indicating a similar reliability for the
