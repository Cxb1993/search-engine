一、前言 
隨著資訊科技與網際網路的高度應用，以及雲端運算的發展，服務提供者
(Service Provider, SP)開始結合異業或同業網站提供聯合服務(Federated Service)。
對於使用者而言，透過聯合服務平台，只需在該平台內某個SP平台中進行註冊，
並透過跨系統的身分認證即可成為其他SP的合法使用者並使用該SP的服務。然
而，因為SP有時並不能夠掌控到底原先會有哪些使用者可以使用其系統，因此，
目前多半是採用票證導向(Ticket-Based)的做法[5], [32]，類似於Kerberos的概念，
當使用者要使用某個服務時，由該服務所信賴的身分管理機制，去對使用者做認
證，如果該使用者可以使用服務，則由該身分管理機制發給票證，而為了要區別
使用者在該服務能夠進行的權限(例如能夠使用服務的期限，使用者是否已經成
年等)，身分管理機制可以在票證中加入屬性資訊，讓SP依照屬性內的資訊來決
定使用者的權限。此外，亦可將使用者的個人資料放在票證中以提供給 SP進行
個人化的服務。 
然而，在這樣的過程中，也引發許多的問題： 
1. 各服務可能使用不同的存取控制模型：雖然身分管理機制可能在票證中放置
使用者的屬性與其他認證資訊，但是不同的 SP，不一定能夠運用這樣的資
訊來進行存取控制。舉例來說，如果有一個SP所使用的是DAC的存取控制
模型，收到一個含有屬性資訊的票證時，可能就不知道該怎麼去處理。更進
一步來說，對於一個組織來說，其內部的資訊系統，在導入單一登入之後，
也同樣形成可視為是一個聯合服務，不同的是，一個企業或組織，往往會存
在有許多非Web界面的既有系統，這也形成在建立這樣聯合服務的困難。這
也是最近為何許多組織在導入單一登入系統之後，發現只解決帳號的問題並
不足夠，更需要解決權限的問題。 
2. 需要解決身分管理機制與SP的信賴關係：這個問題可以從兩個方面來看：
首先，當SP是以票證為判斷某個使用者是否可以進行存取時， SP要如何決
定身分管理機制是可以信賴的？這就需要有一個建立信賴關係的機制。在過
去，為了要散布CA的憑證，使用者在安裝電腦時，會一併將一些公認的Root 
CA之憑證灌入使用者的電腦。但是，目前對於身分管理機制並沒有一個這
樣的機制，因此，減少SP的管理成本是一個可能方式，舉例來說，像是美
國NIST SP800-63[7]，就將身分管理機制在驗證使用者身分的方式，建立一
個保證等級的標準，1是最低，4是最高，而身分管理機制可以在票證中加入
這樣的資訊，以方便SP決定身分管理機制是否可信[31]。然而，這樣的作法
又會引發另一個問題 ─ 誰可以決定身分管理機制是否為可信賴的？而從
另外一個角度來看，因為可能要將使用者的資料提供給SP，身分管理機制
也需要知道SP是否可信[43]。然而，這也面臨到和前述的情形同樣的狀況 - 
誰可以決定該SP是否可信或是真的滿足他所揭示的隱私權政策？ 
3. 使用者隱私的保護：在SP需要使用者的資料時，過去常使用的做法是使用
者導向的做法(User-Centric)，在使用者導向的做法當中，是由使用者依照SP
所提供的隱私權政策來決定是否要給他自己的資料。然而，過去的做法過於
僵化，變成所有的使用者就只能決定是否要接受SP的隱私權政策，而欠缺
一個在中間做協商的機制。而從另一個角度來看，使用者有時會有匿名使用

而針對前述之問題，本架構可提供以下之解決方案： 
 對各服務可能使用不同的存取控制模型之問題，本計畫的跨系統的認證及存
取控制模組，提供異質權限資訊的轉換與整合功能，以一方面使得權限資訊
可以交換，另一方面可以便於整合管理 
 對於需要解決身分管理機制與SP的信賴關係之問題，本架構之風險分析模
組，可了解身分管理機制與SP的風險，並且提供相關的稽核軌跡，以確保
風險管理程序的落實 
 對於使用者隱私保護而言，本機制提供隱私協商模組，可用 更有彈性的方式
保護使用者隱私。除此之外，並使用密碼學技術，去落實隱私資料之保護 
 
二、研究目的 
網際網路上提供的各項網路服務帶給人前所未有的便利性，在進行電子商務
交易時，使用者僅需提供個人資料，即可不用出門輕鬆完成商業交易。且隨著
Web Service等標準服務界面的出現，政府與企業紛紛採用並將其利用於資料交
換[15]應用上，而Web Service是經由Web通訊協定與開放式標準資料格式，SP
可以透過Web Service提供服務給予其他應用程式的軟體元件。但使用者對不同
服務業者進行線上購物時，無法免除在各服務系統註冊使用者個人帳號，使得產
生反覆登入不同 SP所造成的成本與不便。且越來越多的個人資料需要在網站與
組織之間交換，如何建立一個單一登入或身分管理的機制，對使用者進行認證與
存取控制成為一個重點。為滿足隱私與個人資料保護的要求，本聯合服務平台建
跨系統認證及存取

圖3為具隱私協商與風險管理之聯合服務架構流程。假設使用者已於 IDP註
冊使用者相關資訊，與評估Web Application相關風險等級情況下。步驟1至3為使
用者取得IDP。當使用者對應用程式提出服務請求時，應用程式將會要求使用者
輸入IDP帳號並記錄使用者選擇的IDP。步驟4至步驟9為隱私協商流程。在取得
IDP位置後，隱私協商模組應用端(以下稱之應用端)利用HTTP標頭(Header)傳送
隱私協商政策。隱私協商模組的User Agent(以下稱之User Agent)偵測到P3P標頭
資訊存在後，將解析隱私政策XML檔案內容，並記錄所有應用端程式所提出的
隱私協商選項。接著User Agent解析應用程式隱私政策的個人資料項目，並與使
用者個人資料偏好設定進行比對。若使用者願意提供的個人資料項目滿足應用端
程式預設隱私政策需求，則隱私協商成功，User Agent將透過HTTP協定傳回預設
隱私政策URL給應用端。若隱私偏好比對失敗，則進行使用者隱私協商建議步驟
(步驟7至8)。 
在隱私偏好比對失敗的情況下，應用端會提供隱私協商政策與風險評估模組
對Web Application做的風險評鑑資訊，並且User Agent會針對應用端所提供的隱
私協商政策進行隱私洩漏程度分析，進而讓使用者了解Web Application所存在的
風險等級與提供使用者選取建議的隱私政策。使用者不接受隱私協商模組所建議
的協商策略，亦可自行選擇隱私協商結果，或選擇不接受協商。若使用者在感受
到Web Application高風險的情況下，又或是沒有使用者願意接受的建議隱私政策，
User Agent將會回傳隱私協商失敗訊息給應用端。若使用者根據本身隱私需求選
擇適當的應用端提供的隱私政策(步驟8)，User Agent將會對協商結果所產生的隱
私政策之內容進行SHA-1運算[41]，並透過HTTP協定，告知應用端使用者所選擇
的隱私政策(步驟9)。

圖5是說明針對三個子系統共同運作流程，我們將以多組不同類型使用者相
關資訊進行系統測試，整體系統運作流程如下：一、使用者於IDP註冊：輸入使
用者基本資料，如姓名、生日、地址等；二、自訂隱私政策：基於P3P標準協定，
可以自訂不同使用者之隱私政策；三、選擇應用服務：從虛擬之應用服務，選擇
其中一項服務，進行測試；四、隱私協商：選定應用服務後，SP與使用者進行
隱私協商。若協商成功，則繼續執行身分鑑別；否則重新選擇進行隱私協商；五、
身分鑑別：SP向IDP取得使用者相關資訊，以判斷使用者是否存取權限。若鑑別
成功，則取得所需之服務；否則重新選擇應用服務。 
此外，將技術移轉至合作廠商，其中龍捲風科技主要產品或業務：龍捲風科

隱私協商等模組)導入其應用定位即播系統，以加強系統之存取控制的安全性；
惟新科技股份有限公司主要產品與業務為網路安全(Network Security)、內容安全

分析。

中心－IDP。在符合OpenID的規範下，任何網站都可以同時是OpenID的SP，透
過其他IDP鑑別使用者以使用服務；亦可同時為IDP，提供使用者註冊與資料管
理，並為其他SP提供身分鑑別的服務。 
如今OpenID的IDP包含Google、Yahoo、AOL等，SP包含WordPress、Blogger
等。可見許多著名的網站與服務皆已加入OpenID協定，可透過OpenID協定進行
身分鑑別或提供服務。於2007年已有4500家網站整合OpenID協定，Yahoo於2008
年宣布已有2.48億使用者註冊Yahoo ID[36]，足見OpenID使用推展之快。因此本
計畫採用OpenID作為鑑別機制的基礎進行延伸，在與各大網站可以溝通的基礎
下再進行機制補強。 
OpenID規範包含三個角色，分別為使用者、依賴方(Relying Party)與IDP，分
別簡述如下[35][36]： 
 使用者：想要透過IDP向依賴方表明身分，並使用依賴方服務的人 
 依賴方：提供服務的網站，會利用IDP鑑識使用者的身分。亦會被稱為
SP 
 身分提供者：提供OpenID鑑別服務的網站，可透過OpenID URL、XRI
等方式辨識使用者並進行鑑別。亦會被稱為OpenID提供者(OpenID 
Provider) 
OpenID 鑑 別 協 定 分 為 同 意 階 段 (associate) 、 立 即 檢 查 ID 階 段
(checkid_immediate)、檢查ID階段(checkid_setup)與鑑別階段(check_authentication)，
分別敘述如下 
 associate：SP與IDP建立管道以交換秘密參數，在OpenID規範中建議使
用的交換演算法是Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange，並利用雜湊函數確認
完整性。此階段採用POST的方式進行傳遞，請求訊息包含模式與會議
方式；回應內容包含會議識別值、期限、公鑰與秘密參數的雜湊值。 
 checkid_immedicate：辨識使用者宣稱的身分是否合法。此階段採用GET
的方式進行傳輸，請求訊息包含模式、使用者身分識別值、會議識別值、
回應位址與信任的根目錄；回應內容除請求內容外，亦包含簽章欄位與
簽章內容，以確認回傳內容的完整性與不可否認性。 
 checkid_setup：辨識使用者宣稱的身分是否合法，但會等待IDP進行鑑
別的動作。其傳遞內容與checkid_immedicate只有些微不同，主要在於
模式方面會包含回應或取消的值。 
 check_authentication：詢問 IDP訊息是否合法，通常是無法進行狀態控制
的SP收到一個無法辨識的會議辨識值時進行。此階段使用POST方式進
行傳輸，請求訊息包含所有傳輸內容與其簽章，回覆訊息會告知正確或
錯誤。 
對於使用者、SP與IDP的詳細流程，如Google的Federated Login for Google 
Account Users[18](如圖6所示)如下圖所示：

 繞道：若風險項目的風險等級太高，組織不願為其作控制、轉移或
其他的處理時，則迴避可能會導致發生此風險項目發生的風險因
子。 
 透過風險監控去確保風險處理措施的有效性，並定期或不定期重新評估
風險，以便確保風險識別與評估結果之有效性。 
在1990年代初期，已經約有超過五十種以上的風險管理方法或工具被提出
[2]。隨著資訊安全風險管理持續的演進，有些方法或工具被淘汰，有些則是更
加成熟。本研究檢視市面上諸多資訊安全風險管理方法與工具，包括：Callio[8]、
COBRA[10]、CounterMeasures[11]、CORAS[12]、CRAMM[13]、EAR/Pilar[16]、
GSTOOL[21]、MODULO[33]。發現這些系統正如本研究所訪談專家之意見，雖
然各自的功能都有提供，但是較少從決策者的角度，提供從評估、處理，到後續
監控的完整考量。 
3. Single Sign-On (SSO)、Federated Identity Management (FIM)、Federated Identity 
and Access Management (FIAM) 
為減少使用者因為無法記憶密碼而將密碼寫下來或是使用簡單密碼等安全
風險，像是RADIUS(Remote Authentication Dial in User Service) [40]與Kerberos[16]
等單一登入系統即被開發出來。讓使用者只要登入一次，就能使用組織內的多個
不同系統[17], [18]。基本上，傳統的單一登入系統比較針對讓企業的員工去存取
該企業內的不同資訊系統。今年來，聯合身分管理系統被提出，更進一步考慮到
跨組織存取的問題。簡單來說，聯合身分管理系統(Federated Identity Management, 
FIM)要讓不同的組織可以聯合起來，而使用者只要登入一次，就可以使用到不
統組織所提供的服務[6]。在目前，已有許多有關跨系統身分認證與存取機制的
標準被提出，像是 ID-FF[23]、SAML[39]、Akenti[45]、WS-Federation[21]、
OpenID[22]、CardSpace[23]。除此之外，Shibboleth、GridShib、MAMS、SWIFT
等系統被提出而應用在網格運算等環境當中。由於目前跨系統身分認證與存取機
制的標準很多且相容性不高，因此如何整合不同標準的界面亦是重要的研究課題，
因此，陸續有許多研究[27], [37], [24]在探討不同標準或系統。 
除單一登入與聯合身分管理系統的功能外，聯合身分及存取管理系統更進一
步考量到使用者跨系統進行存取的存取控制與授權問題。就目前來說，多半會採
用Ticket-Based或是斷言導向(Assertion-Based)的方法，由使用者取得存取服務用
的票證，票證是由一個由SP所信賴的對象所發給，當中有使用者的個人資料屬
性，而SP就可依此票證的內容來決定使用者得權限。因為牽涉到信賴關係，所
以如何讓IDP、SP與使用者之間互相知道彼此的可信賴程度或安全等級，就是一
個相當重要的事。舉例來說，IDP可以將其依照NIST SP 800-63的認證信賴等及
放在票證當中，SP就可以知道這個使用者是被用什麼強度的認證方式所認證，
而可以提供不同的服務[30]。 
4. P3P(Platform for Privacy Preferences)規範 
為保障使用者網際網路隱私權，W3C提出 P3P(Platform for Privacy 
15 
 
五、結果與討論 
OpenID雖然有提供網路服務傳遞隱私政策的方式，但因為 IDP無法辨別網
路服務傳送的隱私政策是否與使用者的隱私協商結果相同，造成 OpenID無法檢
驗應用程式存取個人身分或資料時，是否有違反隱私協商結果，並且無法了解判
斷個人資料存放在其中的安全風險。有鑑於應用程式在取得 IDP 提供的使用者
身分或個人資料時存在侵犯隱私的可能性，本整合型計畫提出一個適用於
OpenID 的隱私協商架構，以保障網路使用者的個人隱私。在本架構中，使用者
可以自訂隱私政策並了解合作 SP之風險等級，並讓使用者或聯合服務的身分管
理機制，能夠得知這方面的資訊，而藉由判斷個人資料存放在其中的安全風險，
而決定是否要提供個人資料。因此，本計畫達成之成果如下： 
1. 提供具隱私保護的跨系統身分鑑別機制：本計畫以 OpenID為基礎，並整合
隱私協商機制，除達到跨系統的身分鑑別功能，並加入隱私協商功能，讓使
用者進行跨系統的登入與身分認證時，還兼具客製化的隱私保護功能，以保
護使用者個人隱私資料。 
2. 提供跨系統個人資訊交換：以 OpenID為基礎，除可以供原本 OpenID之 SP
於鑑別時請求使用者資料外。在與隱私協商模組合作時，可透過與其套件溝
通確認使用者是否願意傳輸該內容以確保使用者的意願與隱私。 
3. 使用者可自訂個人隱私偏好與協商策略，而應用程式可對不同的使用者，提
供不同的隱私政策。此外，IDP可檢驗應用程式所宣告的隱私政策，是否與
使用者協商結果相同，達到保護使用者個人資料隱私之目的。 
4. 本計畫僅加入部分欄位與新增步驟即可達到隱私協商的功能，更可提昇使用
者的網頁瀏覽經驗。新增步驟部分可以參考圖 1，而新增加的欄位包含
openid.sreg.policyresult、openid.sreg.appid、openid.sreg.policy、openid.sreg. 
policysig、openid.sreg.policytoken與 openid. sreg.negid。 
5. 解決聯合服務的使用者無法了解所使用服務的安全風險的問題。 
6. 提供一套協助組織去建立風險管理制度貨評估自身資訊安全風險的工具，而
本工具可讓使用者依本身的需求，客制化風險評估項目。並可有從整體的角
度去監控風險評估的結果。此工具除可應用在其他子計畫外，也可以解決目
前企業界進行風險管理時所面對到工具太複雜的問題，而可有效提升整體資
訊安全。 
在實務應用方面，本合型計畫之成果將可應用於： 
1. 雲端運算 (Cloud Computing)：雲端運算主要是對使用者 Service on 
Demand[34]，即提供使用者服務所需的資源。然而雲端運算亦需要進行使用
者之鑑別才可以將資源提供給使用者，而雲端運算之架構又與聯合服務相近
[4]，因此本計畫也適用於雲端運算的環境之中。 
2. 在隱私協商部份僅對個人資料維度(Dimension)進行協商，未來將會擴充協商
維度，使協商機制更加彈性。 
3. 資料安全風險的檢測工具可以解決目前企業界進行風險管理時所面對到工
具太複雜的問題，而可有效提升整體資訊安全。

ϣ৒ᄔाǺSince the widespread use of radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices and the obscure 
nature of these tiny RFID tags, security threats and privacy issues become the major 
concerns for those users carrying these tags. Recently, Alomair et al. proposed an 
unconditionally secure mutual authentication protocol, called the UCS-RFID protocol, for 
RFID systems. In their proposed protocol, the tag performs only simple modular 
multiplication operation without any support of random number generation. These merits 
make it very attractive to practical applications especially for low-cost tags. However, 
Almomair et al.’s protocol does not achieve backward untraceability. This paper shows the 
weakness inherent in the USC-RFID protocol, and extends it to provide untraceability in 
the presence of key compromise.

ϣ৒ᄔाǺRegarding to the nature of low-cost RFID tags on security vulnerability, RFID research 
community has made significant progress on authentication design in recent years by 
introducing various lightweight RFID authentication protocols to provide robust system 
security and strong privacy protection. However, a dedicated formal security-provable 
model for RFID authentication design with resource-restricted tag is required to explore 
the security insight of lightweight authentication design in detail. In this paper we 
construct a security analysis model based on service availability evaluation for lightweight 
RFID authentication. The contribution of our study is summarized in three aspects. First of 
all, we introduce a formal definition of service availability for RFID authentication. 
Secondly, we demonstrate how to apply our proposed formal definition to evaluate service 
availability of an RFID authentication protocol through adversarial experiments. The third, 
we show that the proposed service availability experiment can identify security 
vulnerabilities of existing RFID authentication schemes. In other words, these proposed 
protocols cannot guarantee authentication availability from an RFID system point of view.

previously proposed protocols are designed to be computationally secure, i.e., the
security depends on the hardness of solving mathematical problem. Recently, Alomair
et al. [1] proposed an unconditionally secure lightweight RFID (UCS-RFID for short)
protocol, and claimed that their protocol achieved unconditional secrecy and
unconditionally integrity. The security of the UCS-RFID protocol depends on the
freshness of the keys. However, the UCS-RFID protocol does not achieve backward
untraceability, even though it does achieve forward untractability.
Forward and backward untraceability are important privacy properties for RFID
authentication protocol [4]. Forward untraceability requires that even if the adversary
reveals the internal state of a tag at time, the adversary still cannot know whether a
transaction after time  +  (for some  > 0) involves the same tag or not,
provided that the adversary does not eavesdrop on the tag continuously after time.
Backward untraceability requires that even if the adversary reveals the internal state
of a tag at time , the adversary is not able to tell whether a transaction before time
 involves the same tag or not [3]. These two properties are important for the RFID
systems that the equipped tags are low-cost and potentially prone to being captured
and compromised.
In this paper, we first examine the USC-RFID protocol, and show that the USC-
RFID protocol does not achieve backward untraceability. After that, we will extend
the USC-RFID protocol to an enforced one with untraceability.
2 The UCS-RFID Protocol
The UCS-RFID protocol [1] is a lightweight RFID authentication protocol and is the
first RFID protocol providing unconditional security for low-cost tags. The UCS-
RFID protocol has the merits that it does not require tags to support random number
generation and it requires only one simple multiplication on tags. The security of this
protocol mainly relies on the RFID readers capability to deliver random numbers to
RFID tags in an authenticated and secure way.
The UCS-RFID protocol consists of four phases: the tag identification phase, the
reader authentication phase, the tag authentication phase, and the key updating phase
(see Fig. 1 for more details). For the convenience of describing the UCS-RFID
protocol, we first introduce the notations or symbols shown in Table 1. Initially, each
tag Ti has a secret key set
)0(
iK shared with the back-end database. In the following, we
describe the m-th run of the protocol.
Table 1. Notations or Symbols.

iT i-th RFID tag

verifies its integrity via checking whether the equation
pCkkB m

the tag aborts the protocol.
Tag Authentication Phase
(i) Ti computes )()()( i

(ii) After receiving the value, R verifies whether the equation
)()(

mmm
dl
knD  holds. If so, the tag is authenticated; Otherwise, the
tag is rejected.
Key Updating Phase: After a successful mutual authentication between the tag and
the reader, the secret key and the tag identifier are updated at the back-end database
and the tag respectively as specified in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 depicts the protocol for the m-th
run.
The above protocol cannot deter possible denial-of-service attacks (DOS attacks),
and Alomair et al. had extended the above protocol to prevent DOS attacks and
possible key exposure problem. Since these extensions are not relevant to our
improvements, we will not discuss these parts for easy presentation, and interested
readers are referred to [1] for details.

3 Extending the USC-RFID to Untraceability
In Section 3.1, we examine the untraceability of the USC-RFID protocol, and then provide an
improved scheme to enhance its untraceability.
3.1 Untraceability of the UCS-RFID Protocol
Here we show that the UCS-RFID protocol does not provide backward untraceability as
follows.

revealed at time . Let (A, B, C, D) be one eavesdropped message. Then we can tell whether
the message (A, B, C, D) comes from the same tag or not as follows.

pknC

message (A, B, C, D) is the ),,,( )1()1()1()1(  mmmm DCBA from the compromised tag.
We can recursively apply the above steps to trace the messages from the same tag for i-
th run, where 1 mi . That is, the USC-RFID protocol cannot provide backward
untraceability.
Even though the USC-RFID protocol does not satisfy backward untraceability, it does
provide forward untraceability. This is because, in forward untraceability, if the adversary
reveals the internal state of a tag at time, it is required that the adversary does not eavesdrop
on the tag continuously after time . It is this break of eavesdropping that makes the USC-
RFID satisfy forward untraceability.

secure and efficient authentication scheme for RFID systems. Along with this trend, 
the study on the formal security and privacy analysis model for RFID authentication 
protocols has become essential and promptly focused by research community. How-
ever, most of existing relevant investigations [6-9, 12-13] consider the privacy analy-
sis in RFID authentication systems. Only few studies [5] focus on the aspect of securi-
ty analysis. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a formal definition of service avail-
ability for RFID authentication scheme as well as the corresponding adversarial expe-
riment and its utilization. We think that our efforts and results can deliver a significant 
interest on security analysis design of RFID authentication.  
 
In the following, we briefly introduce the related work. In 2006, Juels and Weis [9] 
proposed a formal definition for RFID privacy (denoted as ind-privacy), and revealed 
the vulnerabilities of some privacy-aware RFID protocols. Later, Ha et al. [8] pointed 
out that previously proposed adversarial models have limitations on analyzing RFID 
location privacy. A formal privacy analysis model (denoted as unp-privacy) based on 
random oracle and indistinguishability was then introduced. To pursue more practica-
bility, the proposed formal proof model considers passive/active attacks to the mes-
sage flows between the reader and the tags as well as the physical attacks for disclos-
ing tag’s internal state. Nevertheless, Deursen and Radomirovi [7] had demonstrated 
that the formal proof model for RFID location privacy in [8] does not coincide with 
the intuitive notion of location privacy. At the same year, Damgård et al. [5] proposed 
completeness and soundness requirements which are based on the model proposed in 
[9]. In 2009, Ma et al. [12] presented their efforts and findings as follows: (1) refining 
the unp-privacy model according to its own flaws pointed in the study [7]; (2) proving 
that unp-privacy implies ind-privacy; (3) determining the minimal condition for RFID 
tags to achieve unp-privacy in an RFID system; and (4) developing an RFID protocol 
which possesses strong entity privacy and performance efficiency. Next, Ng et al. [13] 
presented several findings regarding privacy on RFID authentication protocols which 
are symmetric in common. The authors divided existing RFID authentication proto-
cols into four classes and demonstrated the highest achievable privacy level for each 
class. A strong claim of that forward privacy without public key cryptography is still 
impossible in existing RFID authentication proposals is argued. Recently, Deng et al. 
[6] introduced a zero-knowledge based framework for RFID privacy and claimed that 
the proposed framework is stronger than ind-privacy [9]. In addition, an efficient and 
more robust RFID authentication scheme is introduced with a formal proof.  
2   RFID System 
An RFID system generally consists of many objects attached with RFID tags (i.e., 
transponders), an RFID reader (i.e., transceiver), and a backend application server. An 
RFID tag is composed of limited memory space, basic control and computation cir-
cuits and a radio frequency communication module. An RFID reader is used to ac-
quire data stored in tags without line of sight restriction. The backend application 
server is responsible for retrieving and utilizing the detail information of objects at-
tached by RFID tags from corresponding databases. In the normal operation process 
175  
Since the design of RFID authentication, the security of the communication chan-
nel between R and S is always assumed. However, without solid security design, such 
channel may pave a way for adversaries to invoke simple transmission task as parts of 
malicious attacks (or behaviors). For example, if only public key cryptosystem tech-
nology is adopted to secure all communication between S and R, it is possible for an 
adversary to send any given request (or response) to S for asking nothing. In this pa-
per, an adversary Ad may control the communications among parties and interact with 
them through the following oracle queries. 
 
 (O1) InitReader( ): It invokes a reader R to start a session k of the target protocol 
and generate a session identifier sid and a corresponding challenge message ck. 
 (O2) Send(Ti, k, m). This oracle models active attack by allowing Ad to send the 
message m to any given tag Ti, and get Ti 's response in session k.  
 (O3) Send(S, k, m). This oracle models active attack by allowing Ad to send the 
message m to S without getting any feedback in session k.  
 (O4) Eavesdrop(R, Ti, k, m) query. This oracle models passive attack by allowing 
Ad to eavesdrop and get read access to the message m exchanged between R and 
any given tag Ti in session k. 
 (O5) Block(R, Ti, k, m) query. This oracle models active attack by allowing Ad to 
interrupt the message m transmitted between R and any given tag Ti in session k. 
 (O6) SetTag(Ti) query. This oracle models active attack by allowing Ad to update 
key and state information to tag Ti and return Ti's current key and internal state in-
formation. 
 
The oracle O1 is reasonable as a reader (or interrogator) can easily be purchased or 
obtained anywhere. The validity of the oracles O2, O4 and O5 is from the insecurity of 
the channel between any given tag Ti and the reader R, where 1  i  n. The success of 
the oracle O3 depends on the design of the backend communication channel. As men-
tioned before, for instance, if only asymmetric key encryption technology is utilized 
to protect the transmission between R and S, the oracle O3 naturally holds. Hence, it is 
reasonable to assume this oracle. Finally, the vulnerability of tags makes the oracle O6 
feasible.  
 
Definition 1 (Authentication Availability): Assume that at the end of session k-1, 
the secret si shared between any given tag Ti and the backend application server S is 
synchronized. In that case, S and Ti will accept any request (or response) message [ck, 
rk, fk] with probability 1 during the next session k, where ck is a challenge message, rk 
is Ti’s response protected by the secret si shared between Ti and S, and fk is the final 
message based on ck, rk and si.

Every tag Ti is assigned with an l-bit identifier ti=h(ui) which will be stored in Ti’s

attack of ui. For each Ti, the server (with a database) stores an entry [(ui, ti)new, (ui, ti)old, 
Di] in which the currently involved identity (ui, ti)new, the last successfully verified 
identity (ui, ti)old and Ti’s information Di are maintained. At the system initialization, 
(ui, ti)new holds the initial values and (ui, ti)old is set to null. The authentication process 
of 2G09 is presented in Fig. 2.

Step 3: Once the second step is done, the adversary Ad performs the following pro-
cedures immediately. First, Ad selects the target tag Ti, and uses the oracle O1 to in-
voke R to start a new identification session of R2G09. The adversary Ad obtains the 
session identifier k+2 and a challenge message r1_k+2. Second, Ad uses the oracle O3 to 
transmit {M1_k, M2_k, r1_k} to the backend server S. Since {M1_k, M2_k, r1_k} are in-
volved with key (ti)kʿ the legitimacy of {M1_k, M2_k, r1_k} holds and this request will be 
accepted by S. Next, S performs the secrets update mechanism. Now, the secret values 
at S side are (ui, ti)k and (ui, ti)k+3; however, the secret value at the tag side is (ti)k+2. As 
the secrets update mechanism in [15] is involved with at least one fresh (and random) 
 
Finally, Ad finishes the experiment and outputs a bit b' as its conjecture of the value 
of b from ExpAdAvailability. With the above procedures, Ad does make a correct guess of 
b, where only 2, 1 and 1 execution times of O1, O2 and O3 are required, respectively. 
As the probability that Ad (, t, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)-break the availability of R2G09 is sig-
nificant, i.e. Adv(, t, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)=|Pr[Ad’s gu

Claim 2: For any
-availability.  
 
Proof: In the following, we demonstrate that the availability of YW09 scheme can-
not be guaranteed. Given YW09 and relevant security parameter sp, the adversary Ad 
performs the next learning steps. Note that in session k-1 the secret shared between Ti 
and S is synchronized; i.e., the secret at S side is (IDS, K1, K2)=(IDS, K1, K2)k, and th
se rets in Ti are (IDS, K1, K2)old=(IDS, K1, K2)k-1 and (IDS, K1, K2)new=(IDS, K1, K2)k. 
 
Step 1: The adversary Ad first exploits the oracle O6 to compromise an arbitrary tag 
Tj and obtains the shared secret RID, where iЋj. Ad is then suspended and monitors 
the channel involved with the target tag Ti until a normal operation process of YW09 
between the reader R' and Ti is held. During such authentication procedure, Ad records 
{(A||B||C)У(R1||R1||R1)}k with the oracle O4 and intercept the message {D}k via the 
oracle O5. Now the secret at S side is (IDS, K1, K2)=(IDS, K1, K2)k, and the
(IDS, K1, K2)old=(IDS, K1, K2)k and (IDS, K1, K2)new=(IDS, K1, K2)k+1. 
 
Step 2: The adversary Ad monitors Ti's communication channel until a whole au-
thentication session of YW09 between another reader R'' and Ti is complete. Note that 
in this step (i.e. session k+1), {(A||B||C)У(R1||R1||R1)}k+1 and {D}k+1 are produced and 
based on (IDS, K1, K2)k. As n1 and n2 are fresh at each session, {(A||B||C)У(R1||R1||R1), 
D}k+1 is different from {(A||B||C)У(R1||R1||R1), D}k. In addition, since (IDS)k+1 cannot 
be found in S side, the old tag pseudonym (IDS)k and corresponding record (K1, K2)k 
will be used to pass the legitimacy examination at R' side. Thus, the tag Ti will update 
its secrets (IDS, K1, K2)old=(IDS, K1, K2)k and (IDS, K1, K2)new=(IDS, K1
er S will update the shared secret (IDS, K1, K2)=(IDS, K1, K2)k+2. 
 
Step 3: Once the second step is done, the adversary Ad immediately selects the tar-
get tag Ti and invokes oracle O1 to obtain a session identifier k+2, a state information 
st and the challenge Hello message. The adversary Ad executes twice oracle O2 opera-
tions to send “Hello” to Ti, and Ti responds {(IDSk||IDSk)У(RID||R1_k+2), RID+R1_k+2}. 
In that case, Ad can derive the values R1_k+2 and {(A||
o the values RID and R1 obtained in step
 
 Ad then uses the oracle O2 to send {(A||B||C)kУ(R1_k+2||R1_k+2||R1_k+2)} to Ti. Since 
{(A||B||C)kУ(R1_k+2||R1_k+2||R1_k+2)} are involved with maintained record (IDS, K1, K2)k 
and fresh pseudo random number R1_k+2, {(A||B||C)kУ(R1_k+2||R1_k+2||R1_k+2)} will be 
verified successfully by Ti. Now the secrets at Ti side are (IDS, K1, K2)old=(IDS, K1, 
K2)k and (IDS, K1, K2)new=(IDS, K1, K2)k+3; however, the secret at S side is (IDS, K1, 
K2)old=(IDS, K1, K2)k+2. As the secrets update mechanism in [18] is involved with fresh 
(and random) sessio
183       
(DATA), and the fast search key (PRNGm(EPCnew) and PRNGm(EPCold)). The initial 
values of the old and new secret keys Ki_old and Ki_new are both set to Ki. The normal 
au entication process between the reader and the tag is as shown in Fig. 4.

After retrieving the values from the corresponding tuple, S computes the values 
H1=M1PRNG(Ki_newn1) and H2=M1PRNG(Ki_oldn1). Next, the binary

After S has the intermediate values Inew, Iold, TID and TID, the verification 
process is invoked to determine the secret key. If Inew=CRC(EPC||n1), then the 
secret key fro  tag reply is up-to-date; the server computes Ki=Ki_new, 
EPC=EPCnew and TID*=LSTnew+TID1. Otherwise, the equation 
Iold=CRC(EPC||n1) should be true, the equations Ki=Ki_old, EPC=EPCold and 
TID*=LSTold+TID2 are calculated by the server. Next, two logical relations, 
TID*ЋTID1 (or TID*ЋTID2) and TID*ЉTIDold, are examined. If o

The adversary Ad then uses the oracle O3 to transmit {M1_k', M2_k} to the backend 
server S. Since {M1_k', M2_k} are based on secret (EPC, Ki, TID, LST, PRNGm(EPC))kʿ 
the legitimacy of {M1_k', M2_k} holds and this request will be accepted by S. Note that 
the verification of TID and TID will be passed in a significant chance as these two 
numbers may be added by 2 with probability 50%. After that, S performs the secrets 
update: the secret values at S side are (EPC, Ki, TID, LST, PRNGm(EPC))k+3 and (EPC, 
Ki, TID, LST, PRNGm(EPC))k. On the other hand, the secret value at Ti side is still 
(EPC, Ki, TID, LST, PRNGm(EPC))k+2. Since the secrets (i.e. EPC) update mechanism 
in [10] is always involved with a 
 
Finally, Ad finishes the experiment and outputs a bit b' as its conjecture of the val-
ue of b from ExpAdAvailability. With the above procedures, Ad is able to make a correct 
guess of b with probability 50%, where only 2, 1 and 1 execution times of O1, O2 and 
O3 are required. As the probability that Ad (, t, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)-break the availability 
of LY07 is significant, i.e. Adv(, t, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)=|Pr[Ad’s g
In this paper, we have introduced a formal definition of authentication availability and 
its relevant adversarial experiment. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one 
to introduce the concept of authentication availability and the corresponding protocol 
analysis model. In addition, according to our proposed definition of service availabili-
ty for RFID authentication and corresponding adversarial experiments, we have dem-
onstrated that an adversary can easily break the availability of RFID authentication 
mechanisms [10, 15, 18] with a non-negligible probability and within a polynomial 
execution time frame. Our analyses indicate that the secret update mechanism and 
secret redundancy design (i.e., to store both new and old secret values in database) 
proposed in [10, 15, 18] make these protocols themselves difficult to support authen-
tication availability. Any future extension without modification on either secret up-
date mechanism or secret redundancy design will not remedy the identified authenti-
cation flaw. Moreover, based on the same analysis logics in claims 1, 2 and 3, the 
studies in [1-4, 11, 14, 16-17] have also failed to guarantee authentication availability. 
In the future, we plan to construct the formal definition for security robustness on 
RFID authentication and design

ABSTRACT 
To earn computational efforts and communication costs saving in verification of 
authenticity of public keys used in key distribution/conference key distribution 
protocols, the authors proposed two authenticated key distribution protocols and one 
conference key protocol using identity-based self-certified public keys. These 
protocols have the following properties: (i) Verification of authenticity of public keys 
do not require extra public key certificates and computational efforts. (ii) Key 
establishment and validation of the desired public keys are integrated in a logically 
single step. (iii) The registering user can use his/her derived private key to check the 
validity of his/her public key issued by SA. (iv) SA cannot access to users’ private 
keys, and hence all private keys cannot be compromised if SA is disrupted or 
corrupted. (v) The proposed protocols provide key authentication property whereby 
one user is assured that no other user aside from specifically identified user(s) may 
gain access to the derived shared key/conference key. The proposed protocols are 
secure against some possible but potential attacks in effect under the intractability of 
solving the discrete logarithms and reversing the adopted one-way hash function.

1. Introduction 
In 1976, Diffie and Hellman invented a concept of the public key cryptosystem [3], in 
which each user has a key pair consisting of a private key and a public key. The 
private key is kept secret while the public key is made public such that the knowledge 
of public key does not allow the computation of the private key. With usage of such 
key pair, any two users could establish a common secret shared key without sharing 
the same secret key beforehand as secret key cryptosystem. However, it is pointed out 
that most of the public key cryptosystems suffer from the so-called active attacks,

In 1991, Girault [5] proposed another variation of public key system, namely 
self-certified public key system, with implicitly self-certified public keys to resolve 
the verification of the authenticity of the public key and the private key of each user 
could be determined by himself/herself or together by him/her and SA such that only 
the user himself/herself knows the private key (as opposed to SA having access to 
each user’s private key in identity-based approach). The so-called self-certified public 
key of each user is issued by SA and its authenticity could be verified by the 
associated user only with his/her chosen corresponding private key. The verification 
of the authenticity of self-certified public keys can be further carried out with 
subsequent cryptographic application (e.g. key distribution or signature scheme) in a 
logically single step without any extra certificate as certificate-based approach. 
Therefore, it earns more efficiency in saving the communicational costs and the 
computational efforts to validate public keys as compared with the certificate-based 
approach.
Similar ideas to self-certified public keys system, Al-Riyami and Paterson [1] 
proposed a new approach in 2003, namely certificateless public key cryptography 
(CL-PKC). In this approach, SA generates partial private key, then each user 
generates his/ her private key and public key using user’s secret value and partial 
private key. The concept was to oppose to SA having access to each user’s private key 
in identity-based approach and was the absence of digital certificates and their 
important management overhead. However, CL-PKC approach can not resolve the 
verification of the authenticity of the public key. 
Elaborating on the merits inherent in both the identity-based and the self-certified 
approaches, Saeednia [12] recently proposed an identity-based self-certified public 
key system and applied it to realize key exchange protocols. Later, Wu et al. [18] 
pointed out that Saeednia’s public key system is vulnerable against the impersonate 
attack and then presented an improvement to eliminate the flaw inherent in the 
original system. Recently, based on the discrete logarithms, Wu [17] proposed a new 
identity-based self-certified public key system and applied it to realize digital 
signature/multisignature schemes. In this article, we intend to propose two 
authenticated key distribution protocols by using identity-based self-certified public 
keys and apply them to construct a conference key distribution protocol. The shared 
key established by two communicating users in the first key distribution protocol is 
fixed and the same for every session initiated by the same users, but it is variable in 
the shared key distribution protocol. In the conference key distribution protocol, the 
chairman could perform one of two key distribution protocols to establish the shared 
key with each participant respectively. And then, he/she can broadcast the conference 
information such that only the legitimate participants can derive the conference key

Fig. 1. User registration stage 
To establish a secret shared key between two communicating users in key distribution 
stage, two key distribution protocols will be proposed. In the first key distribution 
protocol (being abbreviated as KDP1), the shared key established by two 
communicating users is fixed and the same for every session initiated by the same 
users. That is, the shared key is computed from user’s private key and the other user’s 
self-certified public key. Illustration of KDP1 is depicted in Figure 2(a). In contrast to 
KDP1, the shared key established by two communicating users for every session is 
variable in the second key distribution protocol (being abbreviated as KDP2). In 
KDP2, each communicating user randomly chooses an integer (protected by discrete 
logarithm problem) and sends the corresponding commitment together with his/her 
identity information and self-certified public key to the other. Thereafter, they can use 
respective private keys to derive the shared key from the received messages. 
Illustration of KDP2 is showed in Figure 2(b). Notice that: (i) Verification of 
respective public keys and the shared keys established in KDP1/KDP2 are implicitly 
integrated. (ii) The identities of participants can be corroborated. (iii) KDP2 is secure 
against the known-key attack (i.e., if compromise of the past shared key, then the 
adversary can compromise the future shared key or plot impersonation [8]), but KDP1 
is not.

Key distribution protocols. Let iu  and ju  be two users who want to establish a 
secret shared key between them by applying either KDP1 or KDP2. Details of these 
two protocols are described respectively as follows.
The first key distribution protocol (KDP1): Each user transmits his/her identity 
information and public key to his/her correspondent, i.e., iu  transmits { iI , iy } to ju
and ju  send { iI , iy } to iu  as Figure 2. Thereafter, iu  and ju  can compute the 
shared key by himself/herself from the following equality respectively: 
pIhySK ijj xIhyjjij mod)))(((

iu  and ju  can check whether or not jiij SKSK   in a simple way as [5]. Notice 
that the equivalence of ijSK  and jiSK  also implies that the authenticity of iy  and 
jy  are verified, and identities of iu  and ju  are corroborated. The correctness of 
KDP1 is showed as follows. From eqn. (6), we can have

3. Self-certified conference key distribution protocol 
In this section, we apply KDP1/KDP2 stated in previous section to construct a 
conference key distribution protocol, called a self-certified conference key 
distribution protocol. The system model and the realization of the conference key 
distribution protocol are stated below. 
3.1 The system model of the self-certified conference key distribution protocol 
The conference key distribution protocol is divided into four stages: system setup, 
user registration, and conference key distribution, and conference key recovery. The 
system setup and user registration stages are the same as those described in previous 
section. In this system, each user should perform the user registration to obtain his/her 
valid self-certified private-key/public-key pair that will be used in the subsequent 
stages. When n participants want to hold a secret conference, any of them can act as a 
chairman to perform conference key distribution. In the conference key distribution 
stage, the chairman randomly chooses a conference key and then applies KDP1 or 
KDP2 to establish a shared key between the chairman and other participants. Further, 
he/she constructs an authentic message polynomial with the knowledge of the chosen 
conference key, the established shared keys, and participants’ identity information by 
Lagrange polynomial formula [8] so that only legal participants can recover the 
conference key. Finally, he/she broadcasts his/her identify information, self-certified 
public key, and the constructed authentic message polynomial to all participants of the 
conference. Thereafter, legal participants can perform conference key recovery stage 
to recover the conference key. Illustration of the self-certified conference key 
distribution protocol is depicted in Figure 3.

4. Security analyses 
The security of the self-certified key distribution and that of conference key 
distribution protocols are based on the following well-known cryptographic 
assumption: 
One-way hash function (OWHF): Let h be a one-way hash function. Given h(X), it is 
computationally infeasible to find M [3]. Moreover, it is computationally infeasible to 
find M and M   such that h(M)= )(Mh   [14].
Discrete logarithm problem (DLP): Given a prime p, a generator 
  of order q over

discuss some possible attacks on compromise of authenticity of 
private-keys/public-keys and show that these attacks would not succeed in effect. 
Consider the scenario of an active adversary advu  attempts to choose a 
non-registering identity information advI  and contrive a valid self-certified 
private-key/public-key pair ),( advadv yx  satisfying eqn. (5) without the assistant of SA. 
From eqn. (5), it is to see that advu  cannot plot such attack under the DLP and the 
OWHF assumptions. 
Consider the scenario that an active adversary may try to masquerade as some user 
iu  to deceive ju  into believing that he/she shares a secret key with iu  associated 
with iI  by plotting substitution or replaying attacks. This attack can be examined by 
a simple way such as [7], unless the adversary knows ix  or finds another valid 
private-key/public-key pair ),( ii yx   associated with iI . As discussed in Section 4.1 
and previous paragraph, the adversary cannot mount this attack under the 
intractability of solving the DLP or/and reversing the adopted OWHF. 
4.3 Deduction of the shared keys/conference keys 
In the proposed key distribution and conference key distribution protocols, we 
consider a case that a passive adversary attempts to deduce a shared key/conference 
key to threaten the confidentiality using the eavesdropped information. Some possible 
but essential attacks on deduction of the shared keys/conference keys are discussed as 
follows. 
Image a scenario where an adversary aside from specifically identified users attempts 
gain access to a shared key in KDP1/KDP2. From eqns. (6) or (7), one can see that the 
adversary can deduce the shared key from available intercepted information, unless 
he/she knows the private key protected by the intractability of the DLP as discussed in 
Section 4.1. 
Consider scenario of a known-key attack that if compromise of past shared keys 
allows either a passive adversary to compromise future shared keys. The KDP1 is 
vulnerable to the known-key attacks, since the established shared key between two 
specified identified users is always fix and the same. However, the KDP2 can 
withstand this attack due to the unknown time-variant variable ir  protected by the 
DLP. In the proposed conference key distribution protocol, the adversary can 
compromise the conference key only if he/she knows the shared key between the 
chairman and any participant. Thus, the security of the proposed conference key 
distribution against this attack depends on the security of the adopted key distribution 
protocol.
Consider the scenario that an adversary attempts to deduce the conference key 
established in the proposed conference key distribution protocol from available public

6. Conclusions 
Two authenticated key distribution protocols and one conference key protocol using 
identity-based self-certified public keys are proposed. These protocols have the 
following properties: (i) Verification of authenticity of public keys does not require 
extra public key certificates and computational efforts. (ii) Key establishment and 
validation of the desired public keys are integrated in a logically single step. (iii) The 
registering user can use his/her derived private key to check the validity of his/her 
public key issued by SA. (iv) SA cannot access to users’ private keys, and hence all 
private keys cannot be compromised if SA is disrupted or corrupted. (v) They provide 
key authentication property whereby one user is assured that no other user aside from 
specifically identified user(s) may gain access to the derived shared key/conference 
key. As discussion to our security analyses, the proposed protocols are secure against

Title: A Secure Communication Protocol for EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 RFID Systems 
Authors: N.W. Lo and Kuo-Hui Yeh 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure communication protocol for tag authentication 
and data access authorization in EPCglobal Class 1 Generation 2 (EPC GEN-2) RFID systems. 
The proposed protocol adopts a process-oriented design to exploit the memory space at tag 
and backend server ends more efficiently. Based on the formal logic proof and protocol 
analysis, our scheme not only provides data confidentiality and mutual authentication but 
prevents threats of tag tracing and secrecy disclosure. Moreover, the EPC GEN-2 standard 
compliance of our protocol greatly increases the possibility of its adoption by RFID systems 
vendors and industrial customers in practice. 
Title: The Performance Analysis Using Multiple Beams for RFID Warehouse Management 
System 
Authors: Zhang Tongliang, Wei Feng, Tang Hui, Cui Jianming, and Han Dan 
Abstract: In order to enhance the efficiency of supply chain, Radio frequency identification 
(RFID) technology is used to label every cargo. Logistics center (warehouse) is the important 
node in supply chain. The RFID application in warehouse is complicated. The environment 
influence and multi-tags collision would make the reader lost targets. It is desired to raise the 
detect accuracy and detect speed of RFID reader. In this study, we propose multiple antenna 
beam former algorithm based on SDMA (Space Division Multiple Access) theory to get rid of 
the multi-tags interference in warehouse with RFID technology. The simulation results show 
that proposed algorithm can enhance the detect accuracy of RFID reader. It will become an 
effective tool in warehouse management. Further more, the RFID reader using multiple an-
tenna beam former algorithm will save energy.

Title: Cross-Layer Subchannel Assignment with Multicast over WiMAX Networks 
Authors: Chien-Yu Wu, Hann-Jang Ho, and Sing-Ling Lee 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of video stream multicasting over worldwide in-
teroperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks. Since the MAC layer of a WiMAX 
network is connection-oriented, each subscriber must be allocated bandwidth from base sta-
tions before establishing a connection. However, bad connection quality may decrease the 
network efficiency. While a base station allocates subchannels to subscribers, variations in 
channel fading often affect the transmission rate. This paper proposes several transmission 
scheduling schemes to avoid the effects of channel diversity and improve transmission per-
formance. Our strategy is to divide subscribers into several groups depending on the sig-
nal-to-noise rate (SNR) of allocatable channel(s). The objective of this study is to find an op-
timal schedule to minimize the transmission latency of video streaming and maximize base 
station capacity. Simulations show that the proposed methods FF and RFF yield efficient 
multicast scheduling and outperform previous methods.

identification. The proposed protocol first divides target tags into two categories: staying tags 
and new arriving tags. Then two distinct identification processes are invoked in sequence to 
recognize tags in the two tag groups. Based on our theoretical analyses and simulation ex-
periments, AnR reduces at least 10% on communication overhead and 10% to 40% identifica-
tion delay in comparison with Pair-Resolution Blocking algorithm [1-2]. 
Title:On the Impact of Wi-Fi Multmedia Power Save Mode on the VoIP Capacity of WLANs  
Authors: Kwan-Wu Chin 
Abstract: VoIP capacity is an important metric as it determines the maximum number of calls 
that can be supported by a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) before call quality de-
grades. To this end, researchers have conducted extensive simulation and analytical studies to 
determine the VoIP capacity of different WLANs. These previous works, however, assume 
stations are always awake during a call. In 2005, the Wi-Fi Alliance proposed a power saving 
mode extension that allows stations to retrieve packets from the Access Point (AP) at any 
time. In light of this development, this paper derives the VoIP capacity of a IEEE 802.11a 
WLAN where stations sleep for different time intervals. Moreover, it proposes a novel op-
portunistic scheduler that addresses a critical problem that arises when the power save exten-
sion is used in conjunction with a solution that improves the VoIP capacity of a WLAN by 
aggregating packets.

Abstract: Applications using P2P as an Overlay network in MANet (P2M) are very unstable 
in terms of MANet interconnections and P2P churn. MANet-based P2P applications usually 
create a considerable overhead on the P2P consumer due to the control of the end-to-end 
communication with the peer that provides the shared content. Moreover, traditional P2P 
networks offer polluted contents wasting the device´s scarce resources. This paper proposes a 
service that minimizes the P2M environment instabilities for mobile devices and reduces the 
probability of downloading corrupt contents. A prototype was developed to show that SP2MS 
can be easily integrated into the traditional P2P infrastructure.

Title: Street Broadcast with Smart Relay for Emergency Messages in VANET 
Authors: Ching-Yi Yang and Shou-Chih Lo 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is an emerging new technology and a prom-
ising platform for the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The most important application 
of VANET is disseminating emergency messages to warn drivers in case of dangerous events. 
The core technique relies on the design of a broadcast scheme. In this paper, we propose a 
street-based broadcast scheme that is suitable for urban environments and has an efficient 
performance on delivery ratio and rebroadcast overhead. To make our scheme better suited in 
a sparse environment with low density of traffic, the smart relay mechanism was proposed. 
We show the superiority of our proposed scheme over other ones in a simulated environment 
that models real streets and vehicle movements.

Title: Trust Formalization in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks 
Authors: Raihana Ferdous, Vallipuram Muthukkumarasamy, and Abdul Sattar 
Abstract: Recent advances in networking technology have increased the potential for dy-

ad-hoc networks (MANETs) have created problem in resource sharing as they are constructed 
via mobile nodes without any prior knowledge of the existing nodes which may not be trust-
worthy. Trust management appears to be a promising approach to formalize trustworthiness 
among these anonymous nodes. The outcome of the study is to formalize a trust mechanism 
for MANETs. The aim of this paper is threefold: to formalize and evaluate trust, to use trust 
as a basis to establish keys between nodes in MANETs, and to utilize trust as a metric for es-
tablishing secure distributed control in MANETs. We define metrics for nodes to establish 
and manage trust, and use this mutual trust to make decisions on establishing group and/or 
pair-wise keys in the network. We also review the routing protocols of ad-hoc networks with 
trust considerations and select Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), a protocol that can be used in

I.  INTRODUCTION 
For an RFID tag identification operation, how to improve 
the identification throughput is the main concern when design-
ing the corresponding anti-collision algorithm [1-4]. Recently, 
Myung et al. [3-4] proposed two tree-based anti-collision algo-
rithms, called Adaptive Query Splitting (AQS) and Adaptive 
Binary Splitting (ABS), to improve tag identification efficiency 
of the Query Tree and Binary Tree protocols, respectively. By 
maintaining information of staying tags from the last identifica-
tion session, AQS and ABS can quickly identify the staying 
tags and achieve higher throughput when identifying the new 
arriving tags at the current identification session. Later, a per-
formance-enhanced version of ABS, named as Pair-Resolution 
Blocking algorithm (PRB), is introduced by Lai et al. [1-2] to 
increase tag identification throughput. In PRB, a blocking tech-
nique is used to divide the responding sequence (phase) by tag 
groups. In every session, each tag has to compare the received 
inquiry reader ID with its stored reader ID in the previous ses-
sion to divide tags into two groups. If both IDs are identical 
with each other, this tag belongs to the group of staying tags. 
Otherwise, it is one of the new arriving tags. This design pre-
vents RFID signals of staying tags from being collided with 
new arriving tags when executing a tag identification operation. 
In addition, to improve identification throughput, PRB adopts a 
pair resolution scheme to identify one pair of tags instead of 
one tag at each query timeslot. However, in PRB the required 
number of timeslots to identify all staying tags is proportional 
to the number of staying tags which are recognized in the pre-
vious identification session. In this study, we develop an Adap-
tive n-Resolution (AnR) anti-collision protocol to further in-
crease the identification performance by identifying any n stay-
ing tags in only three timeslots. Our performance analyses and 
simulation results show that, in general, AnR significantly out-
performs PRB by achieving about 10% to 40% reduction of the 
total time delay on total identification delay and about 10% 
decrease in the number of transmitted bits. 
II. THE PROPOSED TAG IDENTIFICATION PROTOCOL 
The proposed protocol is targeted for a single RFID reader 
system to efficiently recognize all passive RFID tags within its 
interrogation range in an identification session. We assume 
that the communication channel between the reader and all 
involved tags is synchronized during each query timeslot. The 
reader maintains a two dimensional array to store the timeslot 
numbers in sequence and corresponding identified tag IDs in 
the previous session. In addition, a unique reader ID, denoted 
as rRID, is associated with the reader. In AnR, tag identifica-
tion in a session is divided into two phases by adopting the 
blocking technique. Each tag tj has two counters: Progressed 
Slot Counter (PSCj) and Allocated Slot Counter (ASCj), where 
PSC denotes the current number of tags identified by the read-
er in the ongoing session and ASCj indicates the assigned time-
slot for tj to send its ID as the response. In addition, each tag 
has a variable tRIDj to store the corresponding reader ID in the 
current session. A bit indicator, p2, is used for a tag to imply 
the start of Phase 2 in an identification session when it is set 
as 1. The reader uses three counters: Progressed Slot Counter 
(PSC), Terminated Slot Counter (TSC), and New Tag Counter 
(NTC). The definition of PSCj is the same as the one in the tag.  
TSC is used to determine the number of timeslots required 
during an identification session; therefore, in the beginning of 
a new session Si, TSC stores the largest value of ASC sent by 
identified tags in the previous session Si-1. NTC indicates the 
number of new arriving tags in Si-1. Note that during system 
initialization all counters and variables of both tags and the 
reader are set to zero or null. 
Tag G selects the 4th timeslot and sets its ASCG to 4. Then, the 
reader will not detect any response at the current timeslot 2; 
therefore, it sets TSC=TSC-1=3 and sends an idle feedback to 
tags E, F and G. After receiving the idle feedback, tags E, F 
and G decrease their own ASC values by 1 as the ASCE=ASCF 
=3 and ASCG=4 are all larger than PSC=2. In the next timeslot, 
since ASCE=ASCF =2 are equal to PSC=2, tags E and F will 
send out their IDs at the same time and result in a signal colli-
sion. After detecting the occurrence of collision, the reader sets 
TSC=TSC+1=4 and sends a Collision feedback to tags E, F and 
G. Then, tags E and F, with ASCE=ASCF=2 and PSC=2, ran-
domly add a binary number to their ASC values. Tag G with 
ASCG=3>PSC=2 sets its timeslot counter ASCG=3+1=4. Sup-
pose that tag E selects a binary number 0 and sets ACSE= 
ASCE+0=2, and tag F selects a binary number 1 and sets ACSF= 
ASCF+1=3. Consequently, the tags E, F and G are identified in 
sequence at the next three timeslots. Finally, the reader sends a 
termination command as the PSC=5 is larger than TSC=4 at 
this moment. 
III. PERFORMANCE ANALYSES 
In this section, we analyze the average identification delay 
of AnR in terms of consumed timeslots [1-4]. Let Sr,i be the set 
of all the tags recognized by the reader r in the i-th identifica-
tion session Si. DAnR(Sr,i|Sr,i-1) indicates the consumed timeslots 
of AnR in Si with the identified tag information at the previous 
session Si-1. 
 
Theorem 1: The total timeslots required for identifying n 
tags under Binary Tree protocol is shown in [3-4]. Note that 
p(k)=1-2-k in which k means the currently involved depth of 
the target binary tree.

Proof: In Si, AnR utilizes two phases to identify staying tags 
and new arriving tags, respectively. Obviously, the number of 
timeslots consumed in Phase 1 is near optimal, i.e. only three 
timeslots are required to identify all staying tags. In Phase 2, 
new arriving tags are identified with the same procedure as 
Binary Tree protocol. Assume that the ASCj values chosen by 
new arriving tags are uniformly distributed over the interval 
[PSC+0, PSC+(-1)]. Then,  tags are uniformly divided into  
groups and each group (with -1 tags) is assigned to each 
tags-set l at the beginning of the second phase, where 0  l  
-1. Thus, the total number of consumed timeslots by AnR in Si 
is listed as follows.

Moreover, suppose that the ASCj values chosen by new ar-

IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, we evaluate the identification delay and 
communication overhead of AnR in terms of the number of 
timeslots and the total transmitted bits for tag identification in 
Si [1-4]. Our simulation was written with C# under Visual Stu-
dio .NET environment. Fig.1 and Fig.2 show the simulation 
results of AnR and PRB against various numbers of tags and 
different values of ratio w which is the number of staying tags 
in Si to the number of identified tags in Si-1. In Fig.1, AnR sig-
nificantly outperforms PRB by reducing 10% (w=0) to 40% 
(w=0.8) identification delay time. In terms of communication 
overhead, AnR reduces more than 10% amount of bit transmis-
sion compared to PRB when w>0.4 as depicted in Fig.2. As the 
ratio w increases, the rate of overhead reduction becomes larger. 
With w=1, AnR has the best performance for tag identification; 
only three timeslots are required to complete the identification 
session with the smallest amount of bit transmission.
