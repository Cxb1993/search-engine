Abstract 
 
The recycling of waste home appliances has been an eminent issue globally.  In European 
Communities, the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) requires that 
each member follow the rule from 2006.  In Asian Countries, Taiwan, Japan and Korea are the 
pioneers among them.  This report summarizes the state of art in the recycling of waste home 
appliances of Dutch, Denmark and Sweden among EC members, as well as Taiwan, Japan and 
Korea. 
 
Introduction 
 
The recycling of waste home appliances has been an eminent issue globally because of 
hazardous substances mostly contained.  Recent advanced technologies have been successfully 
applied on the recycling of these wastes.  Waste home appliances are mostly defined as 
television, refrigerator, washing machine, and air conditioner among Asia countries; whereas, as 
all electrical and electronic equipments in European Communities.  In European Communities, 
the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment requires that each member state follow 
the rule from year 2006.  In Asian Countries, Taiwan, Japan and Korea are the pioneers among 
them.  The principle of producer responsibility has been employed in the recycling systems all 
over the world; however, polluters always have to pay in most instances.  This report 
summarizes the state of art in the recycling of waste home appliances of Netherlands, Denmark 
and Sweden among EC members, as well as Taiwan, Japan and Korea. 
 
European Communities 
 
Because of the rapid growth of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in recent years, 
the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have proposed a Directive [1] 
in year 2000, and finalized as DIRECTIVE 2002/96/EC [2] on WEEE in year 2003.  It requires 
that for each Member State, collection systems for WEEE from private households shall be set 
up by August 13, 2005; a rate of separate collection of at least four kilograms on average per 
inhabitant per year of WEEE from private households be achieved by December 31, 2006.  Some 
more requirements could be found in the Directive [2]. 
 
In order to meet these requirements, each Member State has to propose her own solutions.  In the 
following, we report the state of art in the recycling of WEEE of three countries, namely, 
Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden.

supplied, free of charge; pass on of the disposal levy to the consumer.  Consequence for the 
consumers is paying of the disposal levy when a new product is bought and delivered.  The 
collection/recycling routes designed by NVMP are shown in Figure 1.  A consumer who wishes 
to dispose of a product free of charge has two possibilities: hand over to the retailer if a new 
product is brought; hand over to the local waste disposal authority.  A retailer who wishes to 
dispose of a product free of charge has four options: hand over to the local waste disposal 
authority; hand over to a regional storage station; hand over to a distribution center; hand over to 
the NVMP-transport service.  Regional storage station is situated within a radius of 20 km of a 
municipality.  There are about 600 local waste disposal authorities and 65 regional storage 
stations within the Netherlands.  NVMP-transport service is always on-call if there are more than 
8 big white goods, and delivery will be done within 2 working days to the recycling plant.  There 
are 4 recycling companies and 7 recycling plants (only 2 plants for waste refrigerators and 
freezers).

Since “Disposal of white and brown goods decree” has taken effect in January 1, 1999, annual 
collection results are shown in Table 2.  The average weight per inhabitant per year of WEEE 
was 3.6 Kg and 4.0 Kg in 2000 and 2001, respectively.  It is already achieve the requirement of 
113
90% of the total amount of discarded refrigeration equipment for treatment.  At least 95% of the 
content of the cooling agent CFC-12 must be extracted and collected.  The frothing agent CFC-
11 must be extracted at a rate of at least 80%.  Extracted CFC-12 must either be recycled or 
disposed of.  CFC-11 must be disposed of.

The Producer Responsibility for Electrical and Electronic Products Ordinance [6] came into 
effect July 1, 2001.  It grants consumers the right to, when buying a new product, return the same 
number of old products provided they fulfilled the same function as the product purchased.  
Correspondingly, the producers are obliged to, free of charge, take back and treat the products 
returned.  The electrical and electronic waste collected must be treated by a facility qualified for 
the task. The purpose of the legislation is to encourage market-based solutions to the growing 
volumes of waste generated. 
 
Producers are defined as all manufacturers, importers and retailers of electric and electronic 
equipment active on the Swedish market.  They all share the producer responsibility.  The 
ordinance lists ten categories of electric and electronic equipment from households and 
businesses.  Refrigerators and freezers are excluded because of CFC or HCFC related regulations. 
23 trade associations, on behalf of the producers subject to producer responsibility, initiated and 
own El-Kretsen AB. El-Kretsen AB is a service provider and established on March 1, 2001. The 
23 trade associations represent all products concerned i.e. IT products,  white goods, brown 
goods and other consumer electronics, lighting equipments, medical and laboratory equipments 
etc.  The system is financed through fees levied on the sale of new products and affiliated 
producers undertake to declare their sales to El-Kretsen.  Some selected waste disposal levies are 
shown in Table 5.  So far more than 400 international and domestic producers have joined the El-
Kretsen scheme. These producers are estimated to represent more than 90 % of the total sale of 
electronic and electrical products in Sweden.

In coordinate with the recycling policy of EPA, six recycling plants specialized in the treatment 
of waste home appliances have been constructed during 1998 to 2001 [7], which soon lead the 
recycling of waste home appliances in the world. Current recycling system of waste home 
appliances in Taiwan is shown in Figure 4.  Waste home appliances discarded by consumers were 
collected and transported to recycling plants via various collection/recycling routes.  Recycling 
plants are required to have permit* and special facilities especially in the waste refrigerators in 
order to receive recycling subsidy. Collectors will receive collection subsidy from RMF if they 
ship the collected waste home appliances to recycling plants.  Yearly varied recycling rates 
implemented from March 1998 to December 2003 are shown in Table 6.  Yearly audited 
collected results are shown in Table 7.

According to the Act for Nursing & Recycling Resources, waste TVs and washing machines 
were recycled at 1992; waste air conditioners at 1994; waste refrigerators at 1997.  Waste 
computers and some other small home appliances were planned to recycle at 2002 and 2003, 
respectively.  Deposit-Refund system was employed, that is, producers and imports pay deposit 
first; and receive refund later once the wastes had been collected back and recycled.   
Since the execution of deposit-refund system in 1992, there are some problems, such as the 
number of recycling plants is not enough; new recycling technology is improving; producer 
responsibility is the current trend in the recycling policy.  Korean Association of Electronics 
Environment (KAEE) was founded in 2000 as a non-profit organization, and oversees and runs 
the new system of waste TV, refrigerator, washing machine, and air conditioner.  Extended 
producer responsibility was employed in this pilot system.  Since January 2001, volunteer 
producers could join the pilot system as shown in Figure 7; however, producers who are not 
interested in the new system shall follow the regulation of Deposit-Refund system.  This new 
system will be evaluated by EPA in 2003.
