performing the search process, the efficiency 
of the KMSM scheme is enhanced by 
incorporating two fuzzy modules into the 
expansion and contraction operations, 
respectively, in order to adaptively tune the 
search parameters in accordance with the 
current state of the simplex. The 
experimental results based upon 100 
alignment trials of 10 different laser-fiber 
pairs reveal that irrespective of the first light 
position, the 2S-FSM scheme provides a

1. Introduction 
  
The manufacturing cost of a fiber-optic 
device is dominated by the costs incurred in 
the packaging process. Of the various 
fiber-optic packaging issues, automating the 
fiber-optic alignment operation is one of the 
most challenging and is regarded as a 
critical manufacturing technique [1], [2]. 
In recent decades, the emergence of 
multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) automated 
alignment stages has enabled more flexible 
alignment processes to be developed. 
However, the requirement for developing 
rapid, accurate, and robust alignment 
algorithms to exploit the capabilities of 
these dedicated alignment stages to the full 
still exist. The fiber-optic alignment 
operation involves a series of coarse and 
fine alignment steps. The purpose of the 
coarse alignment stage is to capture the 
“first light”. In practice, coarse alignment is 
generally achieved using spiral or square 
scanning techniques with the help of 
machine vision. Having captured the first 
light, a fine alignment process is conducted 
to identify the position at which the 
fiber-laser coupling efficiency is maximized. 
   The simplex optimization algorithm 
was originally proposed by Spendley et al. 
[3] who designated the approach as the basic 
simplex method (BSM). Nelder and Mead [4] 
modified the BSM by incorporating a 
procedure that enables the algorithm to 
adapt more readily to the functional or 
response surface. King [5] further improved 
the performance of the BSM algorithm by 
reintroducing reflection from the 
next-to-worst vertex when encountering a 
failed contraction. The resulting algorithm 
was designated as KMSM. Due to the rapid 
convergence and ease of implementation of 
this algorithm, Zhang et al. [6] applied 
KMSM to automate the fiber-optic 
alignment operation. Several numerical 
simulations of the alignment of a laser diode 
with a side-mode fiber were performed. The 
simulation results confirmed that King’s 
MSM was capable of treating multi-DOF 
misalignments simultaneously and therefore 
yielded a significant reduction in the 
alignment time. 
  Inspired by the results of these works, 
Tseng and Wang [7] employed the KMSM 
for the active alignment of a coaxial-type 
laser diode (LD) with a single mode fiber 
(SMF) on an actual fiber-laser alignment 
machine. The KMSM was successfully 
applied on the planar alignment process and 
the rate of the fine alignment was shown 
effectively improved. However, the work in 
[8] showed that applying the KMSM 
directly to the three-dimensional alignment 
will lead to local peak problem. An idea was 
then proposed in this study to remedy to the 
problem. However, this method has a 
drawback of time-consuming in the 
searching process. Such a problem can also 
be resolved by the method proposed by 
Zhang et al. [9] who measures the laser 
beam point size before the start of the 
alignment process. However, scanning the 
laser beam for each laser-fiber pair in the 
process is quite time consuming. Moreover, 
the assumption of linear power distribution 
on optic axis of the laser diode may lead to 
inaccurate result.  
  To deal with all the problems 
mentioned above, a robust algorithm called 
two-stage fuzzy simplex algorithm (2S-FSM) 
for the multiple DOF laser-fiber alignment 
operation is proposed in the present study.  
In the algorithm, the alignment process is 
divided into two stages, namely the planar 
alignment (two-dimensional alignment) and 
 4
as the angular misalignments and the 
inherent imperfection of the laser, which are 
very likely to occur in the field during the 
alignment process. In practice, this is 
equivalent to the situation where the 
objective function of the process has 
infinitely many local optima in the 3D space. 
As a result, the searching processes are 
always trapped into local optima.  
  To solve this problem, this paper 
proposes a new strategy to speed up the 
alignment process by preventing the 
searching process from being trapped into 
the local peaks.  The basic ideal can be 
intuitively depicted as the process of a ball 
sliding down a valley to its lowest position. 
Because of the characteristics of the laser 
diode power distribution in 3D space, the 
variation of power value along x- and y- 
directions are almost the same for the 
position away from the optic axis of the LD.   
  When it reaches the optic axis, it will 
continue to go along the optic axis toward 
the focal point of the LD lens (the global 
peak). In this motion, the variation of the 
power value with respect to z-direction is 
much smaller than that along the x- and 
y-directions.  Thus the profile for the 
rolling ball can be pictured as a valley with 
the pot-holed hillside and a gradual 
downward river on its bottom of the valley, 
which is a nonlinear curve in the 3D space.  
When the ball is released from any initial 
position, it first slides down the river and 
then floats down to the lowest position of 
the valley along the river. According to this 
idea, the simplex method based alignment 
process in this paper is divided into two 
stages, namely, the 2D planar alignment and 
the 3D optic axis alignment. As shown in 
Fig .1, the 2D planar alignment is started 
from point PA with a suitable initial simplex 
to let the simplex fall  
down to the bottom of the valley, i.e., the 
river (point PB) rapidly.  Note that the point 
A is the position of the first light obtained 
from the stage of coarse alignment. Then the 
3D optic axis alignment is initiated at the 
same point (point PB) based on a carefully 
selected initial 3D simplex.   
The following alignment process will go 
along the optic axis (i.e., the gradual 
downward river) until the simplex 
approaches the lowest position of the river 
(point PC). The steps of the proposed 
strategy are as follows: 
1) Perform the coarse alignment to find 
the first light, i.e., point PA in Fig.1.  
2) Select a suitable initial 2D simplex at 
point PA for a new type of laser diode. 
3) Apply the 2D-FSM so that the 2D 
simplex reaches a peak on the optic 
axis, i.e., point PB. This is the 
maximum of the x-y plane 
corresponding to a specific value of 
z-coordinate. 
4) Select a suitable initial 3D simplex at 
point PB for a new type of laser diode. 
5) Apply the 3D-FSM, as will be 
introduced later, to perform the 3D 
optic axis alignment to find the global 
peak, point PC. 
 
In Step 1, the coarse alignment uses square 
or spiral scan method to find the first light. 
In Step 2, the initial simplex is an equilateral 
triangle with a suitable value of lateral 
length (hereafter called l2D). Since a 
well-chosen value of l2D can effectively 
prevent the simplex from trapping into local 
peaks during the alignment and therefore 
speed up the search, the value of l2D is 
required to determine for packaging a new 
type of LD. The determined value of l2D can 
be applied to package the same type of 
fiber-laser pairs. It is needless to calculate 
l2D for individual fiber-laser pair because 
laser diodes of the same type would always 
possess the similar power distribution 
characteristics.     
 A guideline to determine the value of l2D 
is that its value must larger than half of the 
distance between the main peak and the 
secondary peak of the power distribution 
around the optic axis of the LD.  This is to 
compensate the effect of the diffraction, as 
shown in Fig.2, that is, 
    l2D =1/2 (PB-Lp) × (1+SF)      (2) 
where PB and Lp are the positions of the 
main peak and secondary peak around the 
optic axis, respectively. Here, because the  
characteristics of the optic power 
 6
linguistic statements of this type can be 
easily transferred to a set of fuzzy logic 
rules which can then be applied to determine 
appropriate values of the reflection ratio and 
direction for each expansion, positive 
contraction and negative contraction 
operation performed during the search for 
the global peak on the optical axis.   
Figure 3 presents a flow chart of the 
FSM scheme developed in this study. As 
shown, two fuzzy modules, namely the 
E-Fuzzy module and the C-Fuzzy module, 
respectively, are incorporated into the 
KMSM repeating search process. The 
purpose of these fuzzy modules is to 
determine appropriate values of the 
reflection ratio and direction for the next 
expansion (E-fuzzy module) or contraction 
(C-fuzzy module) step in the alignment 
process in order to dynamically tune the 
moving simplex in accordance with its 
present state. 
In the FSM scheme, the dynamic state of 
the simplex as it moves along the optical 
axis of the LD is defined in terms of three 
parameters, namely the spatial deviation 
between the simplex and the optical axis, the 
geometrical shape of the simplex, and the 
feasibility of the current reflection direction. 
Based upon the value of these three inputs, 
the fuzzy modules generate two outputs, 
namely the reflection ratio (α) and the 
required shifting amount of the reflection 
reference point (β), respectively. Note that 
the 2D- and 3D- alignment stages shown in 
Fig. 2 both adopt the same basic procedures 
illustrated in Fig. 3. However, as will be 
discussed later, the rules applied in the 
respective fuzzy modules are quite different

for the 3D-FSM to monitor how the simplex 
close to the global peak (PC).  
Since the value of PWdiff is within the 
range of 0< PWdiff <1, a value of PWdiff very 
close to 1 means that the simplex is far away 
from its goal position. Conversely, a value of 
PWdiff very close to zero indicates that the 
simplex is approaching its goal position.     
 
4.1.2 Fuzzy input, Shb
  A parameter Shb is proposed to indicate 
the geometry shape of a moving simplex. 
The definition of Shb for the 2D_FSM is 
given by: 
  
),max( BNWCW
BNWCW
hb dd
ddS −= ,            (7) 
where dCW is the distance between XC and XW, 
and dBNW between XB and XNW. The function, 
max(dCW, dBNW), gives the maximum value 
between dCW and dBNW which is used to 
normalize the value of Shb, i.e., such that 
-1<Shb<1 holds. The value of Shb provides the 
 10
information on the value of height-to-base of 
a moving simplex, and thus the shape of the 
simplex. Figure 5(a) shows the relationship 
between the value of Shb and the geometric 
shape of the simplex base in the 2D 
alignment stage. 
Both values of a height-to-base ratio too 
large and too small are not appropriate for a 
simplex because it can lead to a false 
contraction operation in the searching 
process. The most suitable shape of the 
simplex base is an equilateral triangle, i.e., 
the condition Shb ≈ 0 must be satisfied during 
the searching process. With this parameter as 
an input data, the fuzzy modules can keep the 
shape of the simplex base being an 
equilateral triangle as it could as possible. 
For example, if the shape of a simplex is flat, 
e.g., Shb ≈ -0.8, a larger value of the 
reflection ratio (α) should be selected  
to recovery it to an equilateral triangle one. 
On the other hand, if the simplex becomes a 
slender shape, e.g., Shb ≈ 0.8, then a small 
reflecting ratio should be chosen. 
 As mentioned in Section 3, the simplex 
in the optic axis alignment stage is designed 
to being a slender tetrahedron which has an 
equilateral triangle base with a small value of 
area measured on the x-y plane and a larger 
value of height measured along the z-axis. If 
the fuzzy input is applied to 3D-FSM, the 
value of Shb is determined by  
  
),max( BCW
BCW
hb hd
hdS −= ,             (8) 
where hB which is the height of the base of 
the 3D tetrahedron, as shown in Fig.5(b). 
Using Eq.(8), we still can employ the 
concept as in the 2D-FSM to monitor the 
shape of a 3D simplex. Because our strategy 
is to move the 3D simplex as fast as possible 
from its initial position (PB) to the global 
peak (PC) along with the optic axis, fuzzy 
rules are designed such that the simplex 
keeps slender (i.e., dCW >> hB) during the 
process by using the value S
B
hb.  When the 
simplex is close to the global peak, the fuzzy 
rule then change the shape of the simplex to 
an equilateral tetrahedron to accelerate the 
contraction operations.

4.3 The fuzzy modules 
  In the fuzzy modules, the membership 
functions μ(x) corresponding to the proposed 
fuzzy variable are of triangular type as 
shown in Fig.7. The non-fuzzy outputs, α 
and β  are derived by the center-average 
method performed in the defuzzification 
process. 
 
4.3.1 E-Fuzzy module. 
The purpose of the E-Fuzzy module is 
to accelerate the movement of the simplex 
especially when the simplex is located far 
from the global peak. If a small simplex is 
located far from the global peak, then a large 
value of α will benefit the moving speed. But, 
the value of α  should be restricted in such a 
way that the simplex does not overshoot the 
global peak in its next movement when a 
large simplex gets close to the global peak. 
Accordingly, the rules established for the 
E-Fuzzy module in the 3D- and 2D-FSM 
were determined as summarized in Tables 1 
and 3, respectively. It is noted that, in these 
tables, the output values of the fuzzy module 
have been defuzzfied to non-fuzzy variables. 
As shown in the tables, a small simplex with 
a small value of coupling power triggers a 
large value of α since these conditions 
represent the case where the simplex is 
located far from the global peak. For a large 
simplex with a larger value of coupling 
power, a small value of α is assigned to 
decelerate the simplex movement. Note that 
the value of β  in the 2D-FSM is assigned to 
be -1, implying that the reflection direction is 
not adjustable in the 2D alignment.  
 12
 
4.3.2 C-Fuzzy module.  
The C-fuzzy module is applied prior to 
both the positive and negative contraction 
operations. For a simplex initially positioned 
far from the global peak, it is quite often to 
happen that the expansion operation causes 
the simplex to become a shape with a high 
height-to-base ratio. A simplex with this 
particular geometry takes high risk of being 
stuck on a local peak and should be 
recovered to a form that approximates an 
equilateral triangle as closely as possible. 
The introduction of the C- fuzzy modules 
into the contraction operations can prevent 
such a situation from happening.  
    For contraction operations, a smaller 
value of α will lead to a more rapid 
contraction. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assign a smaller value of α to a simplex that 
has a larger size and lies closer to the global 
peak. Conversely, a larger value of α should 
be assigned to a smaller simplex located at a 
greater distance from the global peak. A 
value of β >-1 will produce a more accurate 
coupling position, because the original 
reference point for reflection will be moved 
from XC towards XB for a simplex very close 
to the global peak.  According to the above 
considerations, the fuzzy rules of C-Fuzzy 
module are constructed and listed in Table 2, 
4. The output range of the modules is 
restricted as 0.1≤α≤0.5 and -1≤β≤0, 
respectively.

5.Experiments 
  This section verified the capability of 
the proposed strategy for active alignment of 
an SMF (SM 10/125) with an LD 
(Mitsubishi 725B8F). The experiments were 
carried out on an active automated fiber-laser 
alignment machine (MORITEX FZ-82A, 
Japan). The alignment system was controlled 
by a personal computer on which the 
alignment algorithm was programmed using 
Visual C++ script functions developed by 
MORITEX.  
The system includes 5-DOF for the 
laser-fiber coupling, namely, three 
translations (x,y,z) for the fiber, and two roll 
angles for the fiber and LD.  The roll angle 
and the three translations of the fiber are 
controlled actively by using the stages driven 
by micro-step stepping motors with a 
maximum translational resolution of 0.05µm.  
The LD is unmovable but with its yaw and 
pitch angles controlled passively via an air 
swivel mechanism to compensate the angular 
misalignments.  Thus it is impossible to 
control these two angles during the 
alignment process. The roll angles of the LD 
and Laser diode were also controlled actively 
by their associated micro-step stepping 
motors.  The relative roll angle between the 
laser diode and the fiber affected the 
coupling efficiency notably for an 
angled-facet fiber with the existence of a tilt 
angle [6], a relative tilt angle around the 
z-axis between the LD and the fiber.  This 
value of the tilt angle was resulted from the 
combined effects of the relative pitch and 
yaw angles between the LD and the fiber. In 
this study, the fiber and the LD were fixed to 
yield a relative roll angle for compensating 
the roll angular mismatch. Thus, the 
alignment became a 3-DOF search problem. 
Due to the mechanical constrains, the 
working space of the alignment was defined 
by: -5000μm ≤ x ≤ 5000μm, -5000μm ≤ y≤ 
5000μm, and -1002μm ≤ z ≤ 25050μm.   
 14
Fig.8 Schematic diagram of the 
fiber-laser coupling alignment 
During the alignment process, the 
coupling power between the LD and the 
SMF was detected and recorded using an 
optical power meter system. The 
experimental LD had a nominal peak power 
of 3.17 mW and a wavelength of 1310nm. 
One end of the SMF was angle-faceted with 
a cleaved angle of 8o and another end had a 
face-contact (FC) type connector to an 
optical sensor. For the SMF-LD coupling 
pair, the coupling power reached its 
maximum value when the end face of the 
fiber was located near the focal point of the 
LD lens. Therefore, delaying the start of the 
fine alignment process until the end face of 
the fiber was near this point greatly reduced 
the time required to obtain the maximum 
coupling efficiency. In the current 
experimental set-up, the focal length of the 
LD lens was specified by the manufacturer as 
3510μm, as measured from the end face of 
the laser. Under the laboratory frame of 
reference as shown in Fig.8, this meant that 
the fiber should be moved downward 
-21378.0μm along the z-axis from its original 
position (0, 0, 0) to reach the focal point of 
the LD lens. Fig. 9 shows the measured 
coupling power distribution when the SMF 
end face was near the focal point of the LD 
lens (z = -21378.0μm). The data required to 
construct this figure was obtained by 
recording the coupling power along the spiral 
direction on the x-y plane with a step size of 
0.5μm. It can be seen that many false peaks 
existed around the global peak. The presence 
of these peaks significantly complicates the 
alignment process. Any automatic alignment 
algorithm must be capable of avoiding to be 
stuck on these false peaks. In what follows, 
the coupling efficiency (%) was defined by 
the ratio of the measured power to the 
nominal one.

  Figure 10 shows an example of the search 
using the proposed strategy described in 
Section 2. At first, the coarse alignment 
process was performed on the x-y plane on 
the plane when z =-21090.4μm.  This 
process used the traditional spiral scanning 
method, spinning outwards until the first 
light was captured where the measured 
power is greater than a pre-determined 
threshold value.  Both the positive and the 
negative directions were searched for higher 
power value. The time required depending on 
the power distribution characteristics of the 
LD, initial position of the fiber, and the 
threshold value.  The threshold value was 
traded off with an acceptable running time. 
In this example, the threshold value was 
selected to be 80nW.  Based on this 
threshold value, the first light was found at (x, 
y, z) = (-183.35μm, 25.90μm, -21090.4μm) 
with a coupling power of 145.03 nW 
(coupling efficiency = 5%).  The position of 
the first light was positioned as the centroid 
of the initial simplex for the following planar 
alignment to find the main peak (PB) of the 
plane when z = -21090.4μm by using the 
2D-FSM.  On this plane, the value of PB-Lp 
in Eq.(2) was obtained approximately as 
40μm, which was determined by scanning 
the optical power value along the x-direction 
with a step size of 0.5 μm. By choosing the 
value of the correction factor to be 0.5μm, 
the value of l2D in Eq.(2) was calculated as 
30μm; this indicates that the initial simplex 
was an equilateral triangle with a lateral 
length of 30μm.   
    The effectiveness of the present value of 
l2D had been verified by performing a series 
of 2D alignments using three different values 
of l2D for various initial positions having 
different distances from the main peak, 
namely dAB.  The results shown in Table 5 
indicate that the value of l2D = 30μm was 
actually the optimal value for the present LD 
in terms of the searching speed and the 
success rate. 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
By using the 2D-FSM with the initial 
simplex defined by l2D = 30μm, a position of 
PB on the optic axis was found at (-201.15μm, 
0.21μm, -21090.4μm) with a power value of 
457.75μW.  On this position of PB, an initial 
3D simplex with an equilateral triangle base, 
S3D, and a height of h was constructed:  the 
value for l3D to form the S3D was given as 
2.5μm, (see Eq.(3)),  the value of h given by 
Eq. (4) was 25μm. Using this initial 3D 
simplex, the 3D-FSM successfully put the 
simplex onto its global peak located at 
(-190.20, 1.05, -21377.82) μm, with a 
coupling efficiency of 93%. In this case, the 
time required for the fine alignment was 
26.09 sec.  Figure 10(a) shows the trace of 
the simplex during the alignment. It can be 
clearly seen that, after the 2D alignment, the 
slender 3D simplex successfully moved 
down along the optic axis and finally reached 
the global peak. Figure 10(b) clearly shows 
the moving trajectories of the centroid of the 
simplex along the x-, y- and z- axes. In the 
2D alignment stage, the coordinate of the 
z-axis was kept constant.  On the other hand, 
the z-coordinate varied significantly in the 
3D alignment with small changes of the x- 
and y- coordinates. The evolution of coupling

都與機電及機構之研究有關。在與會的過程中個人聽了數場有關機電及機構之之相關文
章，也參加有關 MEMS 之專題演講”A microassembly System for Manufacturing Hybrid 
MEMS”。由於個人研究機電整合，需要機構方面之研究資訊，因此本次大會個人著重餐與
有關機構創意設計之發表場次。事實上，國內有關此方面之研究，不會輸給國外，因此相
關之構想或是發展方向，均可作為個人後續研究之參考。在聽取不同場次之論文發表，更
