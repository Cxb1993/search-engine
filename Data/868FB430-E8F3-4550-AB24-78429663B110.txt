Characteristics of strain channel 
nNMOSFETs with SiN capping layer were 
investigated in this work. Although the 
incorporation of the SiN capping layer could 
dramatically enhance the carrier mobility and 
thus the drive current of the fabricated devices, 
the resistance to hot-carrier degradation is 
sacrificed as well, owing to the high hydrogen 
contents in the SiN layer which might diffuse to 
the channel region during the process. Even if 
the SiN layer is removed and the channel strain 
released later, the hot carrier degradation 
remains severer than devices without SiN 
capping. Finally, lateral distribution of generated 
interface states due to hot-carrier stressing was 
also investigated in this study.  
Keywords: SiN capping, tensile strain, hot 
carrier stress (HCS), lateral distribution of 
interface state. 
Introduction 
Channel strain engineering improves the 
drive current of MOSFETs by fundamentally 
altering the band structure of the device channel 
and can therefore enhance the performance of 
aggressively scaled devices [1-3]. With the 
performance improvement being demonstrated, 
attentions should now be paid to the associated 
reliability issues for practical applications. 
Currently, device degradation caused by hot 
electrons represents one of the most critical 
reliability issues in deep sub-micron 
NMOSFETs [4,5]. Although the physical 
mechanisms and characteristics of hot electron 
degradation have been extensively examined 
[6,7], there seems to be very few works that 
investigate the impact of SiN capping layer and 
the associated deposition process on the hot 
carrier reliability of the strained devices. In this 
work, we investigate hot carrier degradation 
characteristics of NMOS devices having local 
channel strain induced by a SiN-capping layer.

VDS as compared with the control and 
SiN-removal samples. Because of extra 
hydrogen species, the SiN-removal devices show 
worse lifetime than the control ones. 
The measurement presented in Fig. 1 was 
used to extract lateral diffusion of interface 
states after hot carrier stress. First, Fig. 6 shows 
the local Vth versus distance x of all splits. 
Basically, the lateral doping profile is nearly the 
same, except for the difference in local Vth. The 
variation of Vth is due to bandgap narrowing 
induced by the strained-channel. Moreover, the 
local Vth decreases sharply as x is smaller than 
0.07 µm. We can approximately speculate that 
the drain junction is near x = 0.07 µm. The 
derived profiles of the interface state lateral 
diffusion are shown in Fig. 7 after 100 sec hot 
carrier stress. One can see that the damage 
region is confined within 0.1µm from the drain 
in all splits. In addition, the aggravated hot 
carrier stress of the SiN-removal devices is 
presumably due to the extra hydrogen species 
that may pile up at the source/drain edge during 
the SiN deposition. This explains why the 
SiN-removal devices show larger generation rate 
of interface state than control devices. 
 
Conclusions 
Both the presence of the SiN capping layer 
and the deposition process itself exert significant 
impacts on the device operation and the 
associated reliability characteristics. The 
accompanying bandgap narrowing and the 
increased carrier mobility tend to worsen the 
hot-electron reliability. This work shows that 
hot-electron degradation is adversely affected 
when the SiN layer is deposited over the gate, 
even if the SiN layer is removed later and the 
channel strain is relieved. Owing to the use of 
hydrogen-containing precursors, abundant 
hydrogen species is incorporated in the oxide 
that may also contribute to the hot-electron 
degradation. The edge effect of hot carrier stress 
is also an important factor that causes degraded 
reliability in SiN-removal devices.
