1. Introduction 
 
It becomes a cliché nowadays that the attractions of a product are not solely based on its 
tangible aspects such as price, functionality, promotion, and aesthetic value, but also on its 
intangible aspects such as company reputation, brand loyalty, former shopping experiences, and 
customer service, etc. Therefore, physical features of a product are usually not the primary issues in 
differentiating among similar products, instead, after-sales services and maintenance play important 
roles in both safeguarding the rights and interests of consumers and promoting the sales and 
reputation of product providers. In particular, a good warranty policy of service and maintenance 
signifies the image of high-quality products and thus becomes a powerful weapon for marketing 
products in a competitive market. Warranty and preventive maintenance (PM) are both essential 
concerns in customer relationship management (CRM). Some manufacturers even provide 
competitive customer service programs by amalgamating preventive maintenance with their 
warranty policies. However, maintaining an attractive warranty policy would be typically costly, 
especially if a severely deteriorating product is sold. The trade-off between high warranty costs and 
a great market share is accordingly of special importance for managers in making effective 
marketing decisions. 
In dealing with the problem of product deterioration for reliability analysis, solely considering 
the effect of time or age may not be satisfactory. In fact, usage would be another essential factor that 
accounts for the deterioration. Therefore, a two-dimensional warranty with considerations for both 
time and usage for deteriorating products would be more practically accepted and merit both 
manufacturers and customers, since such a flexible policy creates a comprehensive environment for 
both sides in seeking a compromising resolution. Conventionally, the rectangle type of 
determination interval for repair-replace strategies was frequently employed in developing 
two-dimensional warranty models, and the optimal policy depended merely on the objective of cost 
minimization with a predetermined warranty term.  
In this paper, the concept of two-dimensional warranty was integrated with the deliberation of 
PM in order to determine the optimal warranty policy which maximizes the manufacturers’ profits. 
This proposed approach, differs from other methods in two aspects which are: (1) PM was included 
in the model development; (2) the warranty term was not predetermined and can provide 
manufacturers with guidelines with which to offer customers alternative warranty choices with 
either a limited time period or a limited usage degree. Therefore, the decision problem here is to 
investigate the profit changes under different warranty policies by considering the two-dimensional 
deteriorating representation along with a scheduled PM undertaken within the warranty period, and 
derive an optimal warranty policy with two warranty limits along the two dimensions, respectively, 
to maximize the manufacturer’s overall profits. 
Warranties and preventive maintenances for deteriorating products were intensively studied for 
decades. Huang and Zhuo (2004) developed a Bayesian decision process in determining the optimal 
warranty policy for repairable deteriorating products by assuming the deteriorating process follows 
a non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP). Menezes and Currim (1992) proposed a general 
 1
practical usage degree. These two time-dependent measures form a two-dimensional warranty 
problem. A Nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) is assumed to be reasonable in modeling the 
deteriorating process of the product which would be dependent of the aforementioned two measures, 
T(t) and X(t), and if we define r as the ratio of usage degree over actual operating time, i.e., 
)(
)(
tT
tXr = , then the intensity function of such an NHPP can therefore be represented by  
 
λ(t|r) ))(),(( tXtTϕ= . (2.1) 
 
The crucial decision is to derive an appropriate warranty policy with two warranty limits K and L 
along the two dimensions T(t) and X(t), respectively, in order to maximize the manufacturer’s 
overall profits. Let Ω be the set of such decisions, i.e., Ω={K,L}, which suggests that when the 
product has been consumed up to either time K or usage degree L, the warranty term terminates. 
Figure 2.1 shows the two-dimensional warranty policy (Iskandar and Murthy, 2003).

As can be seen in Figure 2.1, the warranty term terminates when either time K or usage L has been 
met. Moreover, there are two situations for the warranty termination: (1) when 0<r ≤ r , warranty 
terminates at time K; (2) when r <r<∞, warranty terminates at time S which is the time when the 
usage degree is up to L. Note that r  denotes the average ratio of actual operating time to practical 
usage degree, which can be obtained from past experiences and collected warranty records. 
Iskandar and Murthy (2003) proposed a functional form for the intensity function to signify the 
interdependences among these three factors T(t), X(t), and r, which is given by  
 
λ(t|r)= θ0+ θ1r+ θ2T(t)+ θ3X(t),      (2.2) 
 
where θ0, θ1, θ2, and θ3 are deterministic coefficients determined by the field experts. For simplicity 
without losing generality, we let T(t)=t which means that the product age is equivalent to its actual

In general, m would be unchanged during the product life once it has been determined. In such a 
case, Kim et al. (2004) simplified the virtual age at a specific time t as v(t)=vj-1+t-τj-1, where τj-1≤t<τj, 
j=1,2,…. Accordingly, the actual age of the product at time t can be inversely derived as 
   τ1( ) (1 ( )) jt v t m −= + − δ τ j-1≤t<τj, j=1,2,, and if our exponential decreasing time reducing function 
is applied, then the actual age at time t would be given by

Moreover, Menezes and Currim (1992) assumed that the amount of product sales q is affected 
by both the product price P and the warranty term K, i.e., q≡q(P,K), and introduced the ideas of 
price elasticity η and warranty elasticity µ which can both be obtained by the historical sales data of 
similar products. The price elasticity denotes the effect of product price on product sales, which can 
be represented as q P
P q
⎛ ⎞∂⎛ ⎞η = ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟∂⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ , and the warranty elasticity denotes the effect of warranty terms 
on product sales, which can be represented as q K
K q
⎛ ⎞∂⎛ ⎞µ = ⎜ ⎟⎜ ⎟∂⎝ ⎠⎝ ⎠ . Note that a higher price usually 
versely correlat e 
negative in general cases. On the other hand, a longer warranty term usually leads to more sales, 
or 
results in less sales. In other words, they are in ed, thus the price elasticity would b
and they are positively correlated, thus the warranty elasticity would be positive in general cases. 
Suppose that the fix and variable costs of the manufacturer are F and C, respectively, the profits f
the manufacturer can be derived as

Meanwhile, the optimal usage degree can be determined as * *L rK=  for each of the two cases. 
Note that the optimal warranty terms from Equations (3.6) and (3.8) are obtained without the

the o
consideration of PM. Since it is assumed that the customers are responsible for the PM expens
ptimal warranty term without PM can be transformed into a longer warranty term, which 
retains the same profits but with PM scheduled in the product life, by letting ( )PMv K K

implication behind the assumption is that when the actual age of the product is up to PMK

product maintains the same situation as at virtual time K  because of the scheduled PM a ities. 
Therefore, the optimal warranty term with PM performing can be derived from Equation (3.2),

Note that the origina ons for th mma cases are (4.31 years or 75,400 
miles) and (3.10 years or 543,000), respectively. However, in order to particularly conform to the 
l optimal soluti e uniform and ga
general situation in the real automobile industry, the units of the optimal warranty policy for the two 
dimensions are set to be a half a year and 5,000 miles, respectively. As shown in Table4.2, the 
optimal policies in maximizing the manufacturer’s profits are significantly different, yet the unit 
price and total profits are similar for the two cases. This can be explained by the fact that the 
gamma distribution is more skewed to the right than the uniform distribution. Figure 4.1 shows the 
density functions of both uniform (0.5,3) and gamma (1.75,1) for the varying ratio of r.

The change of production cost can have impacts on both sale prices and warranty terms, and 
therefore influence the manufacturer’s profits. Figure 4.3 shows the relationship between the profits 
and the production cost for the two cases when ratios r are distributed as uniform (0.5,3) and 
gamma (1.75,1), respectively. As can be seen in Figure 4.3, the case with the gamma type of 
customers seems to be a bit more advantageous than for the case with the uniform type of customers, 
however, they both have the similar decreasing trend as the creases, and it will 
eventually be unprofitable for the manufacturer when the production cost is up to about 160 
thousand dollars.

increases; on the other hand, with a larger warranty elasticity, expanding the warranty term may 
have greater impacts on sales enhancement instead of cost increases. Accordingly, the warranty 
term rapidly increases when the warranty elasticity increases. Figures 4.4(a) and 4.4(b) show that 
the reflection point is around the point which has a warranty elasticity of 1.5. Note that the uniform

the warranty term is when buying a product, and the results from extending the warranty term to 
increase the sales volume would be more significantly beneficial. Figures 4.4(a), 4.4(b) show the 
effects of warranty elasticity on warranty terms and profits, respectively. As can be seen in Figure 
4.4(a), in order to maximize the profits, the manufacturer may need to lengthen the warranty term to 
raise the product sales when the warranty elasticity increases. However, in the numerical cases, the 
reflection effects are observed. This can be explained by the fact that for cases with a smaller

This paper deals with the two-dimensional warranty problem which considers both the aspects 
of time and usage for deteriorating products, and the successive breakdown process of the 
deteriorating product is assumed to behave as an NHPP. The consideration of PM is also embraced 
to develop an approach in determining the optimal warranty policy which maximizes the 
manufacturers’ profits. This proposed approach provides manufacturers with guidelines with which 
to offer customers alternative warranty choices with either a limited time period or a limited usage 
degree. 
It would be practicable to extend this work by dealing with manufacturers with different risk 
attitudes. In such cases, the assumption of risk neutral is doubtful, and all the cost-associated factors 
ought to be reassessed in terms of the perspective of utility. Future work could also be performed on 
refining the proposed model by considering the repair cost as a random variable, since the repair 
cost is subject to different degrees of malfunction. A compound NHPP might be suitable for this 
analysis. It would be interesting to consider that the PM cost could be partially paid by the customer. 
For example, the customer might only pay 50% of the total PM expense. However,

1. Introduction 
 
In this constantly changing business environment, the top management is obliged to face the 
tion in 
which the market structure has properties of both monopoly and competition. In such a 
firms which act independently yet behave 
ompetitively and are free to enter or leave the market. Furthermore, as far as the incumbent firms 
are concerned, not only is the profitability affected by these potential competitors, but also the 
product life is probably changed as a result of the competition. Accordingly, the managers of the 
incumbent firms need to constantly notice their competitors’ behavior along with the corresponding 
information so as to translate the data into useful knowledge for making decisions efficiently. 
It is well known that a product experiences a PLC of introduction, growth, maturity, and finally, 
decline. A number of research papers have discussed the PLC. Chi and Liu (2001) developed a 
stochastic model that offered the optimality of a two-threshold policy on the basis of the product’s 
predictable profit in order to reach a decision about the PLC in uncertain situations. Kim and Hong 
(1999) proposed an EMQ model to determine an optimal production run length in a deteriorating 
production process, where the length and the minimum average cost relevant to the length are 
derived in constant, linearly increasing, and exponentially increasing deteriorating processes. Chang 
and Chang (2003) put great emphasis on the stage characteristic-preserving aspect and presented a 
PLC stage model by aggregating inter-influence behavior in the separate stages. Moreover, a 
dynamic brand sales model proposed by Shankar et al. (1999) weighed up the entrants in different 
stages of life cycle for pharmaceutical products by the speed of reaching the asymptotic sales level, 
the harmful extent by competitor diffusion, and the responsive degree to marketing spending. 
When a new product launches into the market, the fleshy product profits are diminished owing to 
the entrance of the unpopular competitors during the PLC, hence a systematic planning should be 
proposed by the market managers to ensure the success of the development process for the new 
product. Hultink and Langerak (2002) suggested that the competitors act in response to new 
products in accordance with three market signals: hostility, commitment, and consequences. The 
incumbent firms ought to take notice of these signals because the strength of the competitors’ 
reaction was positively related to hostility and commitment but negatively related to consequences. 
Krishnan et al. (2000) proposed the Brand-Level diffusion model, which described when company 
administrators take a challenge of various new competitors in the market, they could identify how 
stern challenges of varying consumer demand, asymmetrical supply and demand, and miscellaneous 
competitive behaviors when they market their goods. When the environmental conditions declare a 
dark future for an existing product, a firm ought to seek some means to adjust the marketing 
strategies before the end of the expected product life cycle (PLC). However, the success of a new 
product’s launching depends on the firm’s strategies. A sound marketing strategy ought to consider 
all aspects. In particular, a company cannot take a myopic view that the competitors will usually 
offer the same or similar products. 
Additionally, some industrial organizations can be attributed to the monopolistic competi
circumstance, the firms in the industry offer heterogeneous products that are close substitutes but 
not identical. Therefore, the industry has enough 
c
 21
analysis of the automobile data. 
Although numerous research papers took the competitors into consideration, the discussions of 
the competitors’ effect on product life were still insufficient. Consequently, in this paper, a Bayesian 
approach that was concerned with the determination of the new product life was provided to 
conduct appropriate strategies against the effects of unappreciated entrants by capitalizing on 
information about competitors’ entry in combination with the characteristics of the PLC. While a 
plan to examine if it is worthwhile collecting additional information was suggested, a Bayesian 
, reliability engineering and software 
reli
decision model was offered to estimate the optimal life that could result in profit maximization for 
the new product. Finally, a numerical example was employed to illustrate the proposed approach. 
 
2. The Entry Process of Competitors 
 
When a new product has been introduced to the public, the incumbent firms in the market are 
confronted with the difficulties of fast changes of the business environment, including the 
fluctuating consumer demand, economical environment, and the entry of competitors. Because of 
the factor of the competitors, the incumbents can’t take an optimistic view of the market potential 
for new products. On the other hand, owing to many reasons, e.g. the fleshy profits in the initial 
stage of the PLC, the obsolescence in the terminal stage, and the unexpected recession, the number 
of competitors that enter the market may gradually increase or decrease as time goes by. 
In this section, the entry of competitors regarding the monopolistically competitive market is 
discussed. Suppose that the interarrival times in which competitors enter the market are independent. 
Since the competitors enter the market vary according to time, we postulate that the arrival rate is 
allowed to be a function of time. Certainly, the counting of competitors’ appearance begins at time 
0=t . Therefore, the competitors’ entry behavior could be presumably modeled by a 
nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) in accordance with the previous description. 
While the NHPP model is employed in expressing the competitors’ entry behavior in this 
research, it is also generally applied to other fields, for instance
ability growth (Yamada and Osaki, 1985). The NHPP is especially useful in modeling arrival 
processes, and the corresponding arrival rate can be illustrated by an intensity function of the form 
);()( xwxu βλ= , where λ  is the scale factor, β  is the altering rate, x  is the elapsed time, and 
(.)w  is the altering function for the fluctuating manner of the arrival process. As regards the 
altering function, the following three intensity functions are often utilized in the NHPP models: (1) 
the linear intensity function, )1()( xxu βλ += , (2) the exponential intensity function, xexu βλ=)( , 
and (3) the power law intensity function, 1)( −= βλβxxu . However, among the above three intensity 
functions, so far as the linear model is concerned, it seems to be confined at all. Huang (2001) 
discovered that the altering speed of exponential function is too fast, and that the power law model 
is more flexible in comparison with the exponential model. There are some other intensity forms for 
NHPP models, e.g., Cox and Lewis (1966), Calvin (1973), Lee (1980), Hjorth (1980), Yamada and

inflection point time along with the delay factor, which is a value between zero and one, depending 
on how quickly the product is estimated to arrive at its half-life, to forecast the sales level at the 
specific time. In this study, we spread out Morrison’s research and postulate that the estimated life 
of a new product is T . Owing to the fleshy profit in the early stage of the PLC, the competitors

The three scale factors with respect to the first segment, the second segment, and the third

respectively, and the speed at which competitors enter the market in the first segment is gradually 
increasing, i.e., 11 >β ; the speed at which competitors enter the market in the second segment

Therefore, the optimal value of T  for the prior analysis could be derived by letting the partial 
derivative of the expected prior profit, namely, equation (8), with respect to T  be zero, and then 
solve for T . 
However, the market managers might not be so confident about the result of the prior analysis,

3.2. Preposterior Ana si
 
Although the market managers could determine the product life primarily by the prior analysis, 
it seems that they would feel less confident about such a decision without collecting any additional 
information. With regard to this problem, a preposterior analysis could be conducted before 
performing the posterior analysis. In this study, the additional information is the consecutive entry

3.3. Posterior Analysis 
 
After considering whether it is worthwhile performing the posterior analysis, the market 
managers have to devote themselves to the posterior analysis if it is worth conducting. The posterior 
analysis can reduce the uncertainty of the decision problem, and the decision criterion for the 
 analysis is the same as the prior analysis f  requirement of the maximum

Moreover, the result of the posterior analysis would be more convincing to the managers, since 
such a result was derived on the basis of the managers’ experience and the additional marketing 
information. 
 
3.4. Natural Conjugate Prior Distribution 
 
A Bayesian decision analysis is typically not easy to perform, since the derivation of 
distributions might involve the use of numerical integrations, especially in the case of multiple 
variables, i.e., 
posterior 
iλ  and iβ . In the state space, the analysis would be much more complicated to deal

appropriate sampling size for the three segments, namely, 1n , 2n , and 3n  by way of the results for 
the preposterior analysis. As regards the sampling scheme we proposed in this study, we would take 
advantage of the previous marketing experience for similar products and gather data about the 
successive entry times of the corresponding competitors with regard to the three segments. After 
collecting the required sample, we should conduct the posterior analysis. Owing to the properties of 
the natural conjugate prior distribution, the posterior distributions of iλ  and iβ  regarding the first 
and third segm e functional forms of the prior distributions butents could be expressed by the sam  
ith parameters updated by the sample information, which can be presented as follows.

ratio of the duration in the first segment to the duration in the whole product life, i.e., r , and the 
ratio of the duration in the first two segments to the duration in the whole product life, i.e., , are 
assumed to be 0.28 and 0.71, respectively. Moreover, the proportion of the reduced deficit due to

we can derive that the optimal T  occurred at 3.714 years and the maximum would be $4,228,008. 
However, the above prior analysis might not be appreciated by the m
experiments. Thus the preposterior analysis would be performed to examine the necessity for 
collecting additional information, and determine the appropriate sampling number with respect to 
each segment in the PLC. Suppose that the unit costs of collecting additional information in the fir t, 
second, and third segment are assumed to be $14,30, $25,10, and $19,60, respectively. In addition, 
the expected prior profits with regard to the first, second, and third segment are 8,059,
