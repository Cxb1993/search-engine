The GB wetting transition can be constructed as a novel GB wetting line in the conventional 
phase diagrams for bulk phases. The GB wetting line is plotted as the “tie-lines” in Fig. 2 and 
the temperature of the tie lines is the wetting transition temperature. Because different GBs have 
different GB energies in polycrystalline alloys, each GB has its own characteristic tie line. 
However, in a polycrystalline sample the tie lines can be represented by two extreme lines in a 
phase diagram (Fig. 2). Above the minimum temperature of GB wetting transition (Tw,min), the 
liquid starts penetrating into GBs. With increasing temperature the extent of completely wetted 
GBs increases gradually and finally all GBs are completely wetted by the liquid at and above the 
maximum temperature of GB wetting transition (T w,max).

The SnIn alloy is a low melting alloys. It has been applied to replace the PbSn solder 
commonly used in electronic components and devices. Recently 40 years, The SnIn alloy has 
been studied in phase transformation. In 1964, the basic SnIn phase diagram was presented by 
Heumann and Alpaut [10]. After that, some researchers had continued to study the phase 
structures and corresponding composition range to make phase diagram clear [11-13]. 
Byeong-Joo et al. critically assessed thermodynamic properties of the SnIn binary alloy by the 
CALPHAD method and presented the more accurate SnIn phase diagram [14]. Although these 
researches already provided information for the SnIn phase diagram, the behavior of the GB 
wetting transition in the liquid + γ two-phase region and the solidus line of the γ phase were still 
unclear. It is the purpose of this study  to investigate at which temperature the GB wetting 
transition does occur and at the meantime confirm the solidus line of γ phase in the SnIn Phase 
Diagram.

micrographs of Sn75In25 annealed specimens after the electrochemical etching. These two 
figures exhibited a much better resolution and less artificial structures. The grain structure, 
liquid phase region and wetted GBs can be distinguished from each other obviously. This 
method is conducive to investigate and analyze the GB wetting transition of SnIn alloys. 
The micrographs of the Sn75In25 specimens annealed at various temperatures for 24 hours are 
showed in Fig. 5. Fig. 5(a) shows that the microstructure of Sn75In25 specimen after annealing at 
141°C. The coarse granular structure is clear to observe. When the annealing temperature 
increases above the solidus temperature, liquid phase appears at the triple junction firstly 
because the condition for wetting the triple junction completely is fulfilled prior that for wetting 
GBs [17]. Afterwards, the liquid begins to penetrate along GBs and a part of all GBs is wetted 
completely which causes some grains separated each other. Fig. 6 shows the partially wetted 
GBs and the microstructure of the liquid phase after quenching. Non-zero dihedral angles (θ > 
0°) and  segmented liquid layers can be found at the partially wetted GBs. The appearance of 
these non-continuous wetting layers at GBs is also observed previously by Straumal et al. and 
they proposed several criteria of wetting transitions at triple junction and GBs [17]. Fig. 6 (c) 
shows that the dendritic microstructure of the region solidified from rapidly quenched liquid. 
The light and dark regions are β- and γ-phases respectively and their composition was showed in 
Table 1.

As annealing temperature increases, the quantity of liquid phase increases in the (liquid + γ) 
region according to the lever rule. Experimentally, more GBs are completely wetted and the 
thickness of liquid layer also increases gradually (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). It is believed that the 
energy of solid/liquid interface decreases more drastically than the GB energy with increasing 
annealing temperature and this makes the amount of GBs completely wetted by liquid increase. 
Over 160°C, a greater part of GBs already is covered with the liquid. When the annealing 
temperature approaches the liquidus temperature, the liquid phase invades the grains and 
occupies the most area of some specimens (Fig. 5 (e) and (f)). Simultaneously, over 300 GBs of 
Sn75In25 specimens were analyzed at 141,151, 161 and 164°C. The relationship between the 
percentage of GBs fully wetted and the amount of the liquid phase is showed in Fig. 7. The 
percentage of GBs wetted fully was proportion to the amount of the liquid phase below 70%. 
However, it must be mentioned that the evaluation of the GB wetting became difficult, when the 
amount of liquid phase exceeds over 50%. By fitting the points linearly, the amount of liquid 
phase above which all GBs were wetted completely is about 70%.

4. Conclusions 
 
The grain boundary (GB) wetting, the phase composition and percentage of GBs completely 
wetted by liquid phase in Sn75In25, Sn80In20 and Sn85In15 alloys annealed in different 
temperatures were investigated. The clear granular structure was obtained by using an 
electrochemical etching method and clearly observed by FESEM. The liquid phase appears at 
the triple junction firstly and penetrates into GBs. The percentage of GBs fully wetted is 
proportional to the amount of the liquid phase and annealing temperature. Many liquid spheres 
precipitating inside grains due to homogeneous nucleation occurred during annealing. The 
amount of the liquid phase above which all GBs were wetted completely is calculated as ca. 
70% in Sn75In25 alloy. Furthermore, according to the results obtained from the EDX analysis, the 
compositions of grains composed of the γ phase lies quite close to the solidus line suggested 
previously and this helps confirming the position of solidus line of the γ phase in the SnIn 
phase diagram.

The grain boundary segregation in an Cu– 5×10–3 at.% Bi alloy annealed at various temperatures 
and hydrostatic pressures in a hot isostatic pressing apparatus was investigated by means of 
Auger electron spectroscopy. It was found that the grain boundary segregation level in the alloy 
decreases from 2 to 1.5 monolayers (ML) as pressure increases from 0.01 to 1.2 GPa at 1173 K. 
At a lower temperature of 973 K the segregation level remained approximately constant at 2 ML 
for all pressures studied. It was also demonstrated that the segregation level in the alloy treated 
at 0.01 GPa depended on the sample cooling rate after annealing. The observed pressure 
dependence of Bi segregation to the grain boundaries was interpreted in terms of 
non-equilibrium segregation during specimen cooling.

The anneals for the investigation of GB “wetting by solid phase” transformations allowed to 
conclude the following:  
1. In-rich solid δ phase can wet the GBs in Cu-rich solid solution (Fig. 1).  
2. Below certain temperature Tws no GBs wetted by the δ–phase are present in the Cu–In 
polycrystals (Fig. 1a, Fig. 2). Mean contact angle at GBs decreases with increasing temperature.  
3. Above Tws = 420°C the GBs wetted by the δ-phase are present in the Cu–In polycrystals (Fig. 
1b, Fig. 2). There amount almost reaches 100%. 
4. At Tds = 500°C the dewetting of GBs by δ-phase proceeds. Above Tds no GBs wetted by the 
δ–phase are present in the Cu–In polycrystals. 
5. Above Tds the mean contact angle at GBs increases with increasing temperature. 
The sequence of GB wetting and dewetting with increasing temperature has been observed for 
the first time.

3. The Cu-rich solid phase wets some Co GBs below the eutectic temperature (Fig. 5). The 
amount of wetted Co-GBs decreases with decreasing temperature.  
4. The Co-rich solid phase does not wet Cu GBs below the eutectic temperature (Fig. 6). It is 
interesting to mention that Co-rich particles are faceted at 750, 900 and even at 970°C (Fig. 7). 
The data on the accelerated decomposition of supersaturated solid solution during the SPD 
deformation in Cu–Co systems have been obtained.

The temperature dependences of contact angle for tilt GBs 66° and 19° <1,0,–1,0> in Zn in the 
contact with In-rich melt has been measured. The GB wetting phase transition occurs at different 
temperatures (373+1°C and 362+1°C, respectively). It has been observed for the first time that 
temperature dependences of contact angle intersect (at about 350°C)

第二天下午，第六屆表面與界面偏析國際研討會正式開始。會議主持人為 Prof. Boris 
Straumal，其正是本計畫俄方主持人。大會安排第一場演講由來自捷克大學 Institute of 
Physics的 Prof. Pavel Lejček發表”Thermodynamic State Functions of Interfacial 
Segregation and Their Role in the Compensation Effect”。Prof. Lejček是國際知名研究偏析
現象的專家，發表眾多著作。在此次報告中，他將過去的研究成果做了整理並歸納出偏
析自由能的分項，即偏析焓與偏析熵之間具有一定關係，而此種關係會形成偏析自由能
的互補效應。第二場演講則由美國 Carnegie Mellon University的 Prof. Paul Wynblatt發表
一電腦模擬的結果：”Modeling the Effects of Surface Segregation on the Equilibrium 
Crystal Shape of FCC Alloy Crystals”。Prof. Wynblatt將表面能差異、規則溶液常數與溶
質應變能合併計算偏析自由能。模擬結果發現，當平衡時一些在純 FCC晶體不會出現
的表面，在偏析作用造成其表面能下降的效應下，會出先在合金晶體的表面出現。接下
來是來自法國 CINAM-CNRS的 Dr. Dominique Chatain的報告，主題是”Surface Diffusion 
and Interdiffusion of Bi and Pb on Cu(100) and Surface Phase Structures”。Chatain女士採用
相當新奇的作法：將 Pb與 Bi分別沉積在 Cu(100)單晶片的兩端，加熱並以 in situ STM
觀察分析這兩種元素在表面形成的表面層厚度與結構。研究發現，Bi會形成顯著階梯
狀結構，Pb則不會。不過，Pb具有較高的表面擴散速率。當 Pb與 Bi接觸，Pb甚至會
將 Bi往回推，使 Bi在擴散層前端形成波峰。之後的演講則是由本人主講，題目是”The

Ryohei Sumi報告”Impact of a Magnetic Field on Grain Boundary Energy in Pure Iron and 
Fe-Sn Alloy”。Mr. Sumi是 Prof. Tsurekawa的學生，其發現的奇特現象，即在無外加磁
場時 Fe-Sn合金之晶界能隨溫度上升而上升，而在加上 6T磁場時會改變的效應，可用
晶界偏析效應解釋。當然其中尚有許多現象合併發生，如鐵磁順磁性質轉變、表面偏析
效應與動力學等等的影響需要更多的訊息來架構出完整理論。會議結束後又討論了下次
會議舉辦的時間與地點，決定將於 2010年在法國舉辦。 
第三天的會議內容分為質傳與熱傳兩議程。在熱傳議程部分，首先由本次會議的主
辦人，馬來西亞科技大學的 Prof. Andreas Öchsner主講”Review of the Thermal 
Conductivity of Cellular Metals”。Prof. Öchsner先介紹多孔性金屬在工業應用上的特性與
其未來發展，再對其熱傳分析進行回顧，最後宣傳明年的 DSL2009會議舉辦時間與地

Interfacial Heat Transfer Characteristics of Cellular Materials”。在報告中，Prof. De Lemos
展現其對熱傳有限元素分析的專業，改變不同多孔結構與柱狀結構，獲得熱傳最佳化之
結構設計。這些分析對應用多孔狀材料於絕熱性構件上具有重要參考價值。第三天的下
