 can be presented in terms of elastic pile length, which depends on the 
modulus of subgrade, Young’s modulus and the moment of  inertia of 
pile [Hetenyi (1946), Titze (1970)]. A constant subgrade modulus is 
considered in the suggestion of Hetenyi (1946) and a linearly 
increasing subgrade modulus with depth is suggested by Titze (1970) to 
determine the elastic pile length. To consider the variation of soil 
stiffness with depth, Lc,const can be also determined by the formulation 
of Randolph (1981) in iterative calculation steps. Some suggestions 
regarding the required embedded pile length are also given in the 
Guidelines of Germanischer Lloyd (2005) to minimize the risk of 
accumulated deformation. The critical pile length ruled by the “zero-
toe-kick” criterion as well as rigid clamping criterion and “vertical-
tangent” criterion (Fig.2) are determined due to the deformation 
responses of pile tip, and mainly considered to limit the deflection of a 
pile under cyclic lateral load [Faber & Klose (2006)]. The pile length 
necessary to reach the zero-toe-kick criterion is defined here as Lc,ztk, 
and the pile length to reach the vertical-tangent criterion is defined here 
as Lc,vt. The zero-toe-kick criterion is presented by Germanischer Lloyd 
in the late 1990s for oil and gas platform foundations and is defined as 
the embedded pile length that ensures two zero deflection points below 
the soil surface. An embedded pile length conforms to the vertical-
tangent criterion should be vertical at least at one location in the 
deflection curve (see Fig.1(a) and Fig. (b)). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 Schematic sketch of a scour hole around a monopile. 
 
The suitability of different criteria regarding to the required embedded 
pile length of monopiles without scour are analysis by Kuo et al. (2010) 
with finite element model, and the critical length Lc,vt and Lc,ztk based 
on the deformations of pile tip are not suitable for determining the 
required pile length to limit the deformation response under monotonic 
loading and cyclic loading.  Under a given tolerance deformation to 
ensure the serviceability of offshore wind turbines, the pile length reach 
critical length Lc,const have a identical accumulation rate of lateral 
deformation at soil surface. 
In the practical design, when a design pile diameter and thickness is 
selected, the penetration depth of monopile is then determined under 
the extreme loading condition to provide a sufficient lateral resistance. 
The minimum required embedded pile lengths are suggested by the 
existing guidelines and regulations to limit the deformation response 
under monotonic loading and cyclic loading. However, the minimum 
required embedded pile length with respect to scour is not been 
investigated intensively until now. The purpose of this study is to 
investigate the effect of scour on the lateral deformation response of 
piles. The suitability of requirements regarding the different critical 
lengths Lc,const, Lc,vt and Lc,ztk for the minimum required pile length is 
discussed. In the following, the deformation responses and the pile 
deflection of monopiles with and without scour are quantified by the 
sate-of-art method (p-y curves method). In all cases, an embedment of 
the pile in homogeneous dense sand is considered.

STATE OF THE ART FOR THE COMPUTATION OF 
DEFLECTIONS OF LATERALLY LOADED PILES WITH 
RESPECT TO SCOUR 
 
The design procedures for pile foundation of offshore wind turbines are 
given in the existing guidelines and regulations (GL, 1999, DNV 2004). 
In these regulations, concerning the behaviour of piles under horizontal 
loading is made to the design code of the American Petroleum Institute 
(API, 2000), where the p-y method is recommended for the design of 
horizontally loaded piles.  
In principle, the p-y method is a subgrade modulus method with non-
linear and depth-dependent load-deformation (p-y) characteristics of 
the soil springs. API (2000) describes the construction of p-y-curves 
for different soil types. Due to API, p-y-curves for sandy soils can be 
derived as follows: 
The maximum mobilized soil reaction force per unit length of the pile 
pu depends on the regarded depth under sea bed z, the submerged unit 
weight of the soil γ’, the pile diameter D and on the angle of internal 
friction ϕ’ of the sand: 
( ) zDczcpus '21 γ+=  (1)
zDcpud '3 γ=  (2) 
The first mentioned equation applies to small depths (pus) and the 
second equation to larger depths (pud), the smaller of both values is to 
be considered. The influence of the internal friction angle is described 
by the factors c1, c2 and c3 (Fig. 3 left). 
The p-y-curve is described by the following equation:

Fig. 6 Load-deformation responses of monopile subjected to 
lateral loads with moment arm h=30m 
 
Under a selected lateral load H=15MN, the monopiles without a scour 
present different pile deflection responses with increasing embedded 
length (Fig. 7). This selected load level is high enough for the design of 
5MW offshore wind turbine based on the authors’ experience. The 
minimum required embedded pile length rules by different regulations 
and guidelines can be determined by the pile-deflection curves in Fig. 8. 
For the monopile subjected to the lateral load with different moment 
arm (h=0m, 15m and 30m), the critical pile length Lc,const is between the 
pile length reach the vertical-tangent criteria and zero-toe kick criteria.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 7 Pile deflection lines of monopile with diameter D=5m in dense 
sand. 
 
For the monopiles without a scour S=0m, the required pile length ruled 
by different guidelines and regulations can be determined in Fig. 8.The 
required embedded pile length Lc,const, Lc,vt and Lc,ztk with a scour 
presented in Fig. 9 are larger than the monopiles without a scour. When 
the embedded pile length exceeds the critical pile, the lateral 
deformations of monopiles at mudline ys are identical. The zero-toe-
kick criterion of embedded pile length Lc,ztk seems over conservative 
for the monopile with and without scour depth.

Fig. 9 Minimum required pile lengths for the monopiles under 
monotonic lateral load with scour depth S=7.5m 
 
The portions of moments applied on the monopiles affect the pile 
deformation responses significantly for the monopile with a large 
diameter. The minimum required embedded pile length for the 
monopiles subjected to a pure lateral load (h=0m) need a larger pile 
length to reach the critical length regulations as Lc,const (Fig. 10). The 
critical pile length due to scour of monopiles increases almost linearly 
with the scour depth in Fig.10. The critical pile length of monopile with 
scour subjected to a lateral load without a moment arm is smaller than 
the critical pile length of monopile subjected to a lateral load with a 
moment arm ruled by critical length criterion (Fig. 10).  
The critical lengths of monopiles without a scour can be also 
determined with the existing suggestions [Hetenyi (1946), Titze (1970), 
Randolph (1981)]. The critical pile length determined from the Hetenyi 
(1946) and Randolph (1981) are 23.1m and 29.7m. The critical pile 
length Lc,const determined from the suggestion of Titze (1970) is 28.3m 
for the monopile with D=5m under the pure H loading condition, where 
the coefficient of subgrade modulus nh=33900kN/m3 for dense 
submerged sand is used based on the suggestion of API (2000). For the 
pure-moment loading condition, the critical length Lc,const is 24.7m for 
the monopiles with D=5m. The critical lengths Lc,const determined from 
657
 length when the pile length exceeds Lc,const. The suggestions of Titze 
(1970) and Randolph (1981) may underestimate the critical length 
Lc,const of monopiles with a scour. Monopiles show a similar 
deformation responses at pile top under cyclic loading when the pile 
length exceeds Lc,const, which is determined by p-y curves analysis for 
monotonic loading conditions. Based on the calculation results, the pile 
length reach vertical tangent criterion may lead to a increase of lateral 
deformation under cyclic loading and imperil the serviceability of 
offshore wind turbines. The critical pile length reach zero-toe-kick 
criterion is over conservative for the monopile with a scour depth till 
1.5 times pile diameter.  For an offshore wind turbine, the tolerant 
deformation of wind energy converters and the applied loading level 
are the most important factors to determine the minimum required pile 
length. For a given pile diameter and scour depth, the critical pile 
length Lc,const can be obtained under a design load level under 
monotonic condition. The deformation responses under cyclic loading 
of this monopile with the critical length should stay within the tolerance 
of wind energy converters. In case that the calculated deformation 
exceeds tolerant deformation of wind turbine, an alternative diameter 
should be considered.

 Due to the location of landslide dams being in mountainous areas, field 
observations are prohibitively difficult to make. The lack of field 
observations results in insufficient data for understanding landslide dam 
geometry when it is formed. Due to mountainous location and weather 
conditions, the geometry of landslide dams is usually evaluated through 
laboratory experiments [Takahashi and Kuang (1988)] or numerical 
models [Hunger(1995), Hunger(2006) ]. Although numerical models 
can analyze the geometry of the dam in three dimensions, a number of 
parameters and field data are needed to perform the analysis [Sousa and 
Voight(1985), Savage and Hutter(1989)]. These parameters and data 
are not available when the landslide dam is newly formed. Therefore, 
numerical models are not suitable for fast analysis of dam geometry 
when the landslide dam is newly formed.  
Takahashi and Kuang (1988) proposed a 2D landslide dam geometry 
evaluation model. This model assumes that a landslide mass with width, 
W, and volume, V, of a uniform deposit at the cross section of the river 
channel. For the vertical section along the river channel, the shape of 
the landslide mass body changes from rectangular to parallelogram, 
then becomes trapezoidal or triangular at last. Based on the assumption 
of constant volume, the geometry of the landslide dam is influenced by 
the quantity of the sediment mass. According to the lab experiments, 
Takahashi and Kuang (1988) claimed that the shape of the landslide 
dam is a triangle if the sediment volume is greater than a critical 
volume Vsc and is a trapezoid if the volume is smaller than the critical 
volume. The critical volume Vsc is defined as.

Takahashi and Kuang’s (1988) model obtained good results in 
laboratory experiments. However, this model assumes that the landslide 
mass is entirely deposited in the river channel. This assumption is not 
applicable to most landslides that occur in Taiwan. In addition, the 
angle of repose is related to geographic conditions, particle size 
distribution, and water content in the sediment. Therefore, the method 
proposed by Takahashi and Kuang’s (1988) may not fit the geometry 
observed in the field. 
 
GEOMETRY OF LANDSLIDE DAMS IN TAIWAN 
 
The major sediment sources that form landslide dams are landslide 
masses from both sides of a river channel. The major causes of the 
landslides include earthquakes, precipitation, snow melt, and volcano 
eruption. Costa and Suhuster (1988) analyzed 128 landslide dams all over 
the world. According to Costa and Suhuster (1988), fifty percent of the 
landslides are induced by precipitation and snow melt and forty percent 
by earthquakes. In Taiwan, landslide dams are majorly induced by 
earthquakes or rainfalls. The height of the dams has significant difference 
between the rainfall-induced landslide dams and the earthquake-induced 
landslide dams [Chen (1999), Chen et al. (2008), Chen et al. (2010), Liu 
(2010)]. The geometry of these dams could be triangle (fig. 1) or 
trapezoidal (fig. 2).

 Therefore, only the angle of the dam in downstream direction of the 
trapezoidal dam φd' and the length of the dam top LT should be 
calculated for trapezoidal dams. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between 
the triangle dam and the trapezoidal dam.

The same evaluation method is used to estimate the height of the 
trapezoidal dam Hd and the angle of the dam in upstream direction φu 
for both triangle dam and the trapezoidal dam. However, the angle of 
the dam in downstream direction has different values between triangle 
dam φd and trapezoidal dam φd'. As shown in Fig. 6, the length of the 
dam top LT can be expressed as:

CASE STUDY OF LONG-CHUNG LANDSLIDE DAM 
 
Lung-Chung landslide dam, formed at Taitung, Taiwan on July 16th, 
2006, was induced by an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on Richter scale. 
The landslides occurred at the right side of the river (Fig. 7 & Fig. 8). 
The volume of the dam was about 600,000 cubic meters. Collapsed 
mass remained partially at the right hand side of the river channel. The 
lake volume at full water level was estimated 800,000 cubic meters. On 
July 25th, the landslide dam overflowed at the south-east side because 
of huge precipitation with Typhoon Kaemi. To lower water level, the 
construction was performed at the site of the spillway in November, 
2007. The height of the spillway was lower by 5 meters. The second 
construction was performed in April, 2008 and the height was lower by 
10 meters. After that, on-site measurement shown on Fig. 9 was 
performed in September, 2008. The height of the Lung-Chung landslide 
dam is approximately 35 meters, and the length is about 500 meters.
