二、Abstract 
 
In this project, we aim to support 
multimedia applications on the mobile ad hoc 
network (MANET). MANETs are autonomous 
distributed systems that comprise a number of 
mobile nodes connected by wireless links 
forming arbitrary time-varying wireless 
network topologies. Therefore the wireless 
topology that interconnects mobile hosts/routers 
can change rapidly in unpredictable ways or 
remain relatively static over long periods of 
time. 
The most evident feature of transmission 
in ad hoc networks is the multi-hop manner. We 
consider important issues in both the MAC 
 2
battlefield, deep in the sea, or floating with tides, 
are also hard to be recycled to recharge batteries 
and then to be placed back to continue 
functioning.  The cheap manufacture cost of 
micro-sensors helps solve this recharging and 
replacement problem to an extent, since most of 
the sensors are dispensed after depletion.  The 
sensors just work until they drain out of the 
equipped battery energy.   
 
3.2 Research issues  
 
 One thing to note is that wireless sensor 
networks are preferred to engage in a long-term 
operation like several months or even years of 
monitoring routines.  For example, a patient 
who has been injected with micro-sensors 
would not desire to take another injection again 
simply just after a few weeks or months.  
Therefore, the problem is then transformed to 
be: how can we extend the lifetime of the sensor 
network as long as possible, providing the 
constrained energy level?  Abundant 
researches have been made to achieve energy 
utilization targeting at all layers.  In physical 
layer, hardware like antenna design, optimized 
frequency usage and encoding/decoding 
modulation are studied.  In link-layer, all kinds 
of energy-efficient Media Access Control 
(MAC) protocols are proposed.  In network 
layer, routing strategies are addressed; others 
like data propagation scheme and topology 
formation are considered supportive for 
efficient energy-consumption.   
 
 IEEE 802.15.4 defines a specification in 
PHY and MAC layers for low-powered 
networks for such usages as wireless 
monitoring and control of lights, security alarms, 
motion sensors, thermostats and smoke 
detectors.  Enabling Wireless Sensors with 
IEEE 802.15.4 has been gaining more and more 
agreements that it fits exactly those 
requirements a wireless sensor networks have, 
and IEEE 802.15.4 starts to substitute the 
position of IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth 
specifications in wireless sensor networks.  
The standard IEEE 802.15.4 intends to reach a 
new audience, with new applications that need 
only moderate data throughput, but require very 
long battery life.   
 
 
3.3 Our contribution 
 
 In this paper, we aim at the routing scheme 
in network layer and propose an 
energy-efficient routing protocol, applying the 
Physical Layer (PHY) and Medium Access 
Control (MAC) specifications for Low-Rate 
Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN) 
standardized in IEEE 802.15.4 Standard.  In 
our proposed routing protocol, we obtain 
multiple paths after one route request when first 
time the traffic session was initiated.  During 
network operation, we deploy small packets as 
 4
extend coverage and to strive for quality-of 
-service, the increased complexity of Bluetooth 
makes itself too expensive and inappropriate for 
applications which demands low-cost and 
simplicity.  Also, the lack of flexibility in 
topologies leads to even fewer chances for 
prevailing implementations. 
 To address the applications where existing 
WPAN solutions are too expensive and some 
performance of a technology is not a necessity.  
In Dec 2000, Task Group 4 under 802 working 
group 5 was formed, concluded on Oct 2003 
with the ratification of IEEE standard 
association of the IEEE standard 802.15.4. 
Thereafter, we can say that IEEE 802.15.4 
enables the applications that were previously 
impractical and complements WPAN 
technology with characteristics of wireless 
connectivity with 
– Low data rate  
– Low power 
– Simplicity  
– Small coverage range (<10m) 
4.2 Propose of IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN  
 The defined objective of IEEE 802.15.4 
Standard is to provide a standard for ultra-low 
complexity, ultra-low cost, ultra-low power 
consumption, and low data rate wireless 
connectivity among inexpensive devices. The 
raw data rate will be high enough (maximum of 
250 kb/s) to satisfy a set of simple needs such 
as interactive toys, but scalable down to the 
needs of sensor and automation needs (20 kb/s 
or below) for wireless communications. 
Some of the characteristics of an IEEE 
802.15.4 LR-WPAN 
— Over-the-air data rates of 250 kb/s, 40 
kb/s, and 20 kb/s 
— Star or peer-to-peer operation 
— Allocated 16 bit short or 64 bit extended 
addresses 
— Allocation of guaranteed time slots 
(GTSs) 
—Carrier sense multiple access with 
collision avoidance (CSMA-CA) channel 
access 
— Fully acknowledged protocol for transfer 
reliability 
— Low power consumption 
— Energy detection (ED) 
— Link quality indication (LQI) 
— 16 channels in the 2.45 GHz band, 10 
channels in the 915 MHz band, and 1   
 channel in the 868 MHz band 
4.3 Specifications in IEEE 802.15.4 
LR-WPAN 
 A system conforming to IEEE 802.15.4 
consists of several components. The most basic 
is the device. Two or more devices within a 
personal operating space (POS) communicating 
on the same physical channel constitute a 
WPAN.   
 
Device type defined in IEEE 802.15.4 
LR-WAPN 
Two different device types can participate 
 6
topology in that any device can communicate 
with any other device as long as they are in 
range of one another. Peer-to-peer topology 
allows more complex network formations to be 
implemented, such as mesh networking 
topology. A peer-to-peer network can be ad-hoc, 
self-organizing and self-healing. It may also 
allow multiple hops to route messages from any 
device to any other device on the network. Such 
functions can be added at the network layer, but 
are not part of the standard. Mesh networks and 
cluster tree networks seen in the Figure are 
examples of a peer-to-peer topology. 
  
Superframe structure 
 
 The basic idea of superframe structure is to 
let devices only activate their transceiver when 
they need to transmit data in order to save the 
energy wasted in idle-listening. With tuning the 
value of beacon order (BO) and superframe 
order (SO), we can determine the duty cycle of 
a device, and this is defined by beacon interval 
(BI, how often it send and hear the beacon to) 
and superframe duration (SD, how long it stays 
active within each beacon interval) whereas:

The LR-WPAN standard allows the optional 
use of a superframe structure. The format of the 
superframe is defined by the coordinator. The 
superframe is bounded by network beacons, is 
sent by the coordinator, and is divided into 16 
equally sized slots. The beacon frame is 
transmitted in the first slot of each superframe. 
If a coordinator does not wish to use a 
superframe structure, it may turn off the beacon 
transmissions. The beacons are used to 
synchronize the attached devices, to identify the 
PAN, and to describe the structure of the 
superframes. Any device wishing to 
communicate during the contention access 
period (CAP) between two beacons shall 
compete with other devices using a slotted 
CSMA-CA mechanism.  All transactions shall 
be completed by the time of the next network 
beacon.  
 
 
  
 Figure 2-3: An illustration of superframe structure 
For low-latency applications or applications 
requiring specific data bandwidth, the PAN 
coordinator may dedicate portions of the active 
superframe to that application. These portions 
are called guaranteed time slots (GTSs). The 
 8
consumption of the entire network. Sometimes, 
routing a packet with more hops of relays 
although demands a larger total energy 
consumption amount benefits the network 
lifetime, like in Figure 3-2, S2 takes a longer 
detour path to D2 to avoid unbalanced load 
distribution on the critical node and therefore 
alleviates the quick death problem. This is the 
basic concept of our proposed algorithm: to 
possibly distribute unbalanced forwarding load 
of the critical nodes in a network to other nodes 
with richer energy in order to prolong its 
operation lifetime. The method we deploy is to 
basically make use of path diversity through 
multipath routing. 
 
 
 
5.2 MALE: Multipath Adaptive Low-powEr 
 
With the goal 
– Dynamically adapt to the network 
conditions  
– To prolong lifetime in advantage of path 
diversity 
 We propose MALE (Multipath Adaptive 
Low-powEr) framework features 
– Cross-Layer Approach 
 y  MAC (with superframe in 802.15.4 
beacon-enabled mode) 
    y  Network (routing) 
– Application (traffic pattern) 
– Path Diversity: multi-path routing 
– Dynamic adaptation to current network 
conditions: probing  
 
5.3 MALE: Basic idea 
 There are two possible ways to do 
load-balancing through routing 
1. Deploy a load-balancing routing spanning 
tree 
2. Perform multipath routing 
  
 To continue discussion, we first specify 
network traffic according to its destination 
device into two types:  
1. Many-to-one (sink): the destination is its 
PAN coordinator; in a wireless sensor  network, 
this type of traffic usually is for data collection 
purpose, of which each  device reports its 
sensing data back to a central controller (data 
sink). 
Figure 3-2: Improve unbalanced load distribution 
problem through path diversity 
2. Peer-to-peer: the destination can be any 
device in the PAN; this type of traffic 
occurs when two devices intend to exchange 
data for some reason, for example, a sensor 
observed the event and then triggered a 
more specified sensor device or an actuator 
to help or take over further tasks. 
 10
          
 
 
 
 
5.4 MALE: Architecture 
 In MALE, network time is divided into 
two stages 
– Initialization 
 y Initiation of a new PAN 
 y Formation of many-to-one balanced 
routing tree, root at PNC (sink) 
– Operation 
 y Data transmission (both sink and 
peer-to-peer traffic) 
 y Path adaptation based on probing info 
(for peer-to-peer only) 
 
 During operation, data transmission is 
handled according to the packet traffic type 
– Sink data: forward to parent node in routing 
tree. 
– Peer-to-peer data  
 y On-demand path setup: for a new p2p 
destination, Route-REQ to PNC for       
multiple paths information. 
 y Transmission uses one selected path. 
 y Source probes current network: obtain 
info for path adaptation after every probing 
interval. 
 
5.5 MALE: Algorithms  
 In a low-rate wireless personal area 
network (PAN), there are N devices, including 
one PAN Coordinator PNC. These N devices 
are all full function devices (FFDs), so that all 
devices are capable as a router to forward 
packets. Each FFD is set in beacon-enabled 
mode. After the PAN is successfully initialized, 
all devices in the PAN are synchronized with 
PNC, following the same beacon order (BO) 
and superframe order(SO).  
Figure 3-4:  
A well-balanced routing tree is still 
badly unbalanced vertically and 
with space to improve. 
 PNC is considered as a data sink and to 
gather network data. All devices reports data 
back to PNC from time to time, which is 
regarded as many-to-one traffic pattern. During 
the network operation, any two devices can also 
communicate with each other, which is 
specified peer-to-peer traffic pattern. 
Network initialization 
 
1. The PAN Coordinator PNC is to start up a 
new PAN and issues the beacons 
specifying the beacon order (BO) and 
superframe order (SO).  
2. All devices get associated and 
synchronized with PNC. The PAN is 
 12
2. Once the counter reaches zero, it triggers to 
issue forward probing agent along all the 
multiple paths to the destination device. A 
forward probing agent is a small control 
packet with only a variable data field 
MIN_ENERGY (initially set to a large 
number.) 
3. When a device receives a forwarding agent 
packet and is not the destined device, it 
compares its current residual energy with 
the MIN_ENERGY value. If less than 
MIN_ENERGY, the device updates 
MIN_ENERGY with its own residual 
energy amount. Otherwise, it does nothing 
but only passes to the next hop. 
4. If a device receives a forward probing agent 
destined to itself, it responses with a 
backward probing agent to source device 
along the reverse path.  The backward 
probing agent is also a small control packet 
which resembles forward probing agent.  
The MIN_ENERGY value in a backward 
probing agent is copied from the 
MIN_ENERGY of the received forward 
probing agent. 
5. Any intermediate device receives a 
backward probing agent straightly passes to 
next hop without attentions.  
6. When the source device gets all the 
backward probing agents from multiple 
paths, it compares gathered MIN_ENERGY 
values and selects the path with maximum 
MIN_ENREGY to route next 
PacketToSendBeforeProbing number of 
packets. The counter is reset to 
PacketToSendBeforeProbing and starts 
count-down again. 
 
 
 
Figure 3-5: An illustration of probing mechanism in MALE 
 
Construction a load-balanced many-to-one 
routing tree 
1. PNC floods the network with the request to 
establish a many-to-one routing tree rooted 
at itself.  
2. The rough routing tree is first linked 
through the parent-selection at each device 
starting from leaf devices in a bottom-up 
way. Each device selects its forwarding 
parent among its neighbors, and 
propagates information (neighbor list, 
descendent node list) upward to root PNC. 
3. In a parent-selection, a device chooses the 
one with least hop-count to PNC; if more 
than one candidate, it further chooses the 
one it first heard broadcast request from.  
4. PNC collects all the aggregated 
information from the network, derives the 
global network topology at initial stage, 
 14
path with least overlapped links in V’(k). 
5. If no such path exists, Multipath(k) is the 
path with least total responsible forward 
loads found in graph G = (V, E) but 
different from previously computed k-1 
paths. 
6. Otherwise, the Multipath(k) doesn’t exist. 
PNC simply replies with k-1 multipath 
information back to source device. 
 
 
 
 
 
六、Performance Evaluation 
 In this section, we provide some 
simulation results. To evaluate the performance 
of MALE, the simulation is run under NS-2 
(Network Simulator 2). 
  
6.1 Network scenario 
We compare two sets of number of devices: 
21 full function device (FFDs) and 37 full 
function devices, with PNC as data sink located 
in the center of the network. The network area 
is 80m x 80m with devices in grid-distribution. 
The transmission range is 12 meters. In the 
experiment of 21 FFDs, there are 20 
many-to-one traffic flows and 6 selected 
peer-to-peer traffic flows; in the experiment of 
37 FFDs, there are 36 many-to-one traffic flows 
and 12 peer-to-peer traffic flows. 
 
Data-rate  250Kbps Initial Energy
Frequency  2.4GHz  TX-Power 
Device number 21, 37 FFDs RX-Power 
Network area  80 m x 80 m Idle-Power 
 
 
 The many-to-one traffic is constant bit rate 
with packet generating at rate of 1 packet per 
second and packet size is 70 byte.  The 
peer-to-peer traffic is set in a poisson traffic 
with packet interarrival arrival rate at average 
distributed within range [0.3, 2.2] second. All 
traffic starts within in interval [20, 30] second, 
and terminated at 250 seconds.

paths

6.2 Models for comparison  
 In the simulation, we deploy the multiple 
paths with a number of two: one path is shortest 
path and the other path is the path with 
minimum total responsible forwarding load.  
Under networks of different <BO, SO> pair 
values, we compare MALE with other two 
models: Round-Robin (RR) which alternatively 
switches between two paths, and Shortest Path

Abstract— Recently, with the rapid development of wireless
technologies and the attractive infrastructure-free nature of
MANET, there is a growing demand for diverse multimedia
applications that require QoS provision in an ad hoc network.
In this paper, we propose a topology-control-based QoS routing
(TLQR) protocol, which is a distributed scheme to intelligently
establish routes with guaranteed end-to-end bandwidth. That is,
we provide a simple residual-hop-count procedure to determine
whether a node is capable to accept the new connection request
or not. In addition, to enhance the network utilization we
incorporate a efficient power adjustment into the route discovery
procedure. The simulation results show that the TLQR routing
scheme is able to (a) figure out a better route not going through
the congestion area in the network, and (b) significantly improve
the network performance by adaptively adjusting its transmission
power, i.e., achieving better spacial reuse of wireless channel.
Thus, we believe that it is a promising way to take the topology
control into account while designing a QoS routing protocol in
an ad hoc network.
I. INTRODUCTION
A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of
mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid
of any centralized administration or existing infrastructure.
Hence, mobile hosts in ad hoc networks communicate in
peer-to-peer mode using multi-hop routing, and all packets
are transmitted in a store-and-forward method from source
to destination via intermediate nodes. Each node acts as
a router, as well as a communication end-hosts. Recently,
with the rapid development of wireless technologies and
the attractive infrastructure-free nature of MANET, there is
a growing demand for diverse multimedia applications that
require QoS provision in ad hoc networks, such as VoIP, movie
on demand, video-conferencing and real-time collaborative
work and so on. We note that these multimedia applications
often have stringent and different QoS requirements in terms
of bandwidth or bounded delay or jitter. Due to MANET’s
dynamic topology, time-varying link capacity, unpredictable
channel condition and shared wireless medium, it is more
difficult to provide QoS support in MANET than in Internet. In
order to provide such QoS guarantee in mobile networks, the
routing protocol needs to be designed to account for bandwidth
and delay constraints while accounting for the radio channel
limitations and node mobility.
A lot of research works have been done for routing protocols
in MANET, such as Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector
(AODV)[1], Dynamic Source Routing (DSR)[2], Destination-
Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) and Temporally-Ordered
Routing Algorithm (TORA) etc. Nevertheless, their primary
design goal is to carry best-effort traffic and provide connec-
tivity between nodes without considering QoS. Other research
works on QoS provisions in ad hoc network deal with schedul-
ing or buffering or routing for QoS requests. Some of research
works such as [5], [6] on topology control for wireless ad hoc
networks has focus on the studies the relationship between
transmission range and throughput or the maintenance of a
network topology with good (or required) connectivity by
adjusting the transmission power. In this paper, we focus on
how each node can ”locally” construct an appropriate network
topology to help on finding out a better QoS routing path while
allowing user requests to successfully set up their connections
as many as possible.
The topology of a MANET is a “set of communication
links s between node pairs used explicitly or implicitly by
routing mechanisms”. A topology control scheme is a way
to determine a proper subset of one hop neighbors for some
purposes, such as less media contention with neighbors and
more efficient energy usage. Hence, in MANET the QoS
provisions, i.e., required end-to-end throughput and bounded
delay, are highly correlated to the network topology. It is likely
that a mobile node could not find a QoS route due to the
poor configuration of the network topology. This is because
if a node uses the maximum power to transmit a data, such
transmission may block the potential chances of other nearby
concurrent transmissions.
For example, Figure 1 illustrates the local network topology
of node A. If node A and node D could both shrink their
transmission range and they do not interfere with each other,
the number of nodes within the two hop communication area
of node A decreases from 8 (node A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H) down
to 5 (node A, B, C, E, F). In this case, due to the spacial reuse,
node A can have additional available bandwidth to admit more
new coming requests. In other words, the larger the power is,
the more poor the spacial reuse of the whole network becomes.
On the other hand, if each node uses small transmission power,
the number of feasible next-hop node become less, i.e., the
network connectivity is poor. Therefore, if the transmission
power of each node can be intelligently chosen, both the
utilization of energy usage in a node and the whole network
capacity can be improved dramatically.
We propose a on-demand QoS routing protocol with the aid
information of the previous hop. For example, in Fig. 2, if the
required bandwidth is bw, the available bandwidth on node B
is 3bw, and the available bandwidth on the rest of nodes are
large than 4bw, the RREQ packet must record the available
bandwidth on both node I (previous node)and B (the node
before the previous node) so that node C knows to discard
the RREQ packet received from node B. On the other hand,
if we include the residual hop count into the RREQ packet,
each node just needs to update the current value of the residual
hop count in the RREQ packet by setting the smallest value
between the residual hop count in RREQ packet (the previous
node’s residual hop count) and its residual hop count based on
its available bandwidth. From the above discussion, Algorithm
1 gives the details about how to compute the residual hop count
of node v from its available bandwidth.
Algorithm 1 Residual-Hop-Count(v,rbw)
1: v: the current node
2: s: the source node
3: d: the destination node
4: bw: the required bandwidth
5: rbw: the residual bandwidth of node v
6: rhc: the residual hop count
7: switch (rbw)
8: case ≥ 4bw: rhc = 3;
9: case ≥ 3bw:
10: if (v is s or next to s ) rhc = 3;
11: else rhc = 2;
12: case ≥ 2bw:
13: if (v is s or next to s ) rhc = 2;
14: else rhc = 1;
15: case ≥ bw:
16: if (v is s) rhc = 1;
17: else rhc = 0;
18: otherwise: rhc = 0;
B. Incorporating Power Adjustment in Route Discovery
Several recent research works on topology control scheme in
MANET have shown that transmitting data with the maximum
transmission power at each node might result in a poor
network utilization. Thus, the key idea of the TLQR scheme
is that if we properly adjust the power level of each node,
the whole network throughput can be improved dramatically.
To reduce the communication overhead of the TLQR scheme,
we divide the transmission area of each node into 6 different
power transmission levels as shown in 3. To incorporate power
adjustment in route discovery, the source host sends a RREQ
packet whose header is modified to include (requested band-
width, LRHC), where the vector LRHC is (lrhc(0),lrhc(1),
lrhc(2), lrhc(3), lrhc(4), lrhc(5)). Each lrhc(i) indicates the
number of residual hub count of the sending host when it uses
the i-th power level to transmit that data packet. When a node
receives a RREQ packet, it first computes its i-th level residual
bandwidth if it use the i-th power level to transmit data. Then,
the node is able to the information in RREQ packet and its

neighbor table to determine the residual hop count of the i-th.
Algorithm 2 presents the detailed steps how a wireless node
update its routing record and decide whether it should forward
it when it receives a route request message.
Algorithm 2 Routing Discovery Procedure
1: Upon receiving a RREQ packet from node u, node v for
power level i = 0 to 5 do {
2: lrhc(i) = residual-hop-count(i) in RREQ packet;
3: if lrhc(i) < 3
4: lrhc(i)−−;
5: if (the distance between node u and node v > the power
level i’s transmission range )
6: lrhc(i) = 0;
7: else
8: rbw(i) = the residual bandwidth of power level i on
node v;
9: Compute rbw(i) based on node v’s neighbor table;
10: rhc(i) = Residual-Hop-Count(v,rbw(i));
11: rhc(i) = min ( lrhc(i), rhc(i));
12: }
13: Check if rhc(i) > 0 for i = 0 to 5;
14: If yes, fill in the needed information and relay this RREQ
packet.
15: else discard this RREQ packet.
When the RREQ packet reaches the destination, the power
levels of the destination and its previous node have been
determined in the route discovery procedure. Of course, if the
destination node is likely to receive several RREQ packets of
different power level, it chooses one route and sends a route
reply (RREP) packet along the reverse path back to the source
host. In order not to shrink the transmission range too much,
the largest transmission power which is feasible to afford the
requested end-to-end bandwidth is used in our TLQR routing
protocol. When the reply packet reaches the source, the path
is constructed successfully. At the end of the connection, the
source node invokes to send a route release message to return
the reserved bandwidth of the route on each node.
III. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed
TLQR routing protocol by the simulation. In the following, we
first describe the simulation environment and metrics used in
the experiments, and then present the simulation results.
