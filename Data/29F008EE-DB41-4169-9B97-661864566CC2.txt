中文摘要 
有些放射性核種如3H、14C、32P、35S等，在攝入生物體內後，可取代生物體內有
機分子中之相同原子，而被限制在生物靶(biological target)(細胞核或DNA)附近。以
氚為例，它在環境中有三種形式存在，分別是元素形式(HT氣體)、氧化形式(HTO
氚水)、及有機分子結合形式(organically bound tritium, OBT有機結合氚)。不論是那
一種形式的氚，在攝入人體後，都容易被吸收、交換、而形成OBT有機結合氚，最
後被限制在生物靶內。氚每次衰變釋出之貝他粒子(最大能量為18 keV)在水中的最
大射程為8微米，約與細胞核的大小相當，故OBT有機結合氚在細胞核的微劑量很
大。又OBT有機結合氚在人體內的生物半衰期長達數年之久，且劑量係數(dose 
coefficient)與相對生物效應(relative biological effectiveness, RBE)均很大，以致造成很
高的體內劑量(internal dose)。由於氚可由宇宙射線產生，也可由核能設施產生，所
以可能大量存在於環境中，形成一般民眾輻射劑量與安全上的問題。國際間近年來，
相當重視氚的體內劑量學與微劑量學研究，譬如國際放射防護委員會(International 
Commission on Radiological Protection, ICRP)即在討論調整OBT的輻射加權因數
(radiation weighting factor, WR)。 
本計畫從細胞微劑量學(microdosimetry)及DNA奈米劑量學(nanodosimetry)兩個
方向， 研究有機結合氚在細胞及細胞核之生物靶中的相對生物效應。研究方法包括
蒙地卡羅(Monte Carlo)模擬程式及組織等效比例計數器(tissue equivalent proportional 
counter, TEPC)，以進行OBT有機結合氚的各種微劑量與奈米劑量計算與度量，包括
線能(lineal energy)分布與輻射加權因數等，並且進一步評估不同生物靶大小的RBE
值。最後，本計畫研究OBR有機結合氚的體內劑量。本計畫之研究成果，有關奈米
劑量學的部分，已發表於SCI國際學術期刊Nuclear Instruments and Methods B，而有
關微劑量學的部分，亦已投稿同一期刊審查中。

要以三種形式存在：氚氣(elemental tritium gas，HT)，氚水(tritiated water，HTO)，
有機結合氚(organically bound tritium，OBT)。 
     
    氚氣是以氣體的形式存在，可以經由呼吸的方式進入人體內，但在人體內大
部分轉換成氚水與有機結合氚，因此氚氣造成的體內劑量，比其他兩種形式的氚
都來得小很多，比較不受重視。氚水是氚與水分子中的氫原子互相交換後所形
成，在自然界中藉由水循環到處傳播，可以經由飲水或食物進入人體中，在人體
內的新陳代謝途徑與水類似，可以自由進出細胞膜，因此氚水在人體中是均勻分
佈的，其生物半衰期約為 10 天。有機結合氚則是氚與有機分子中的氫原子交換
後所形成的，但有機結合氚又分為可交換與不可交換兩種，差別在於氚是與有機
分子中的何種原子鍵結，當氚與氧、氮、硫、磷等原子鍵結時，便稱為可交換的
有機結合氚，因為此時氚容易與其他分子的氫發生交換作用，並不會被侷限在特
定區域內，其生物半衰期約為 40 天；但當氚與碳原子鍵結時，則會造成很強的
鍵結力，以致不會與其他分子的氫原子任意交換，只有經由酵素分解作用才可以
打斷氚與碳原子之間的鍵結，所以稱為不可交換的有機結合氚。這種有機結合氚
不能隨意通過細胞膜，因此在人體內之分佈是不均勻的，一旦有機結合氚被限制
在生物效應敏感區域內的話，因其生物半衰期可能高達 500 天，故對人體造成的
生物效應遠大於以其他型式存在的氚。 
     
  近年來的研究發現，細胞核中的 DNA 是造成生物效應的最主要因素，加上
氚所釋放的能量平均只有 5.7keV，射程約 0.5~0.7µm，因此如果要評估氚對人體
造成傷害大小的話，氚在人體內的分布便顯得很重要。細胞核是由約 70%的水、
20%的蛋白質、3%的脂質、3%的 DNA、4%的核蛋白質所組成，人類生活環境
若受到氚的污染時，氚便可以經由下列幾種途徑轉換成上述不同分子存在於細胞
核中：(1)氚水因為跟水的新陳代謝途徑類似，所以細胞核內的水分子便可以會
被氚水所取代；(2)研究報告指出，人類每天所攝取的蛋白質約有 55%會轉換成
組織蛋白質，因此一旦人類食用到受氚污染的食物時，氚就可能以有機結合的方
式存在於細胞核內；(3)胸腺嘧啶核酸(thymidine)是組成 DNA 的成分之ㄧ，而人
體每天約合成 20 克的 DNA，其中約包含 4 克的胸腺嘧啶核酸，因此當人類誤食
與氚鍵結的胸腺嘧啶核酸時，氚就可能直接鍵結在 DNA 上，NCRP 第 63 號報告
中便推測在食用受到氚污染的食物後，約有 5%到 10%含有氚的胸腺嘧啶核酸會
鍵結在 DNA 上。由上面的描述可以得知氚不論是以氚水或以有機結合的方式存
在於人體內時，皆會存在於對輻射敏感的細胞核內，因此本研究便是要探討氚在
細胞核內的情況下對生物體的影響。 
   
四．研究方法 
   
  本研究以微劑量學與奈米劑量學兩個不同觀點，來做探討有機結合氚造成生
 4
程式(5)來模擬微劑量的參數。PENELOPE 是 Francesc Salvat 等人在 2001 年時發
表的新模擬系統，係使用蒙地卡羅方法來模擬光子和電子在任意組成之均勻物質
中彈性與非彈性作用的一切行為，能量範圍由幾百電子伏特到十億電子伏特，可
以模擬任意的幾何形狀(geometry)。PENELOPE 採用混合型模擬計算法(mixed 
simulation algorithm)，將電子模擬分成兩大部分：強碰撞作用(hard interaction)和
弱碰撞作用(soft interaction)，前者使用詳細追蹤的方法來模擬，後者則使用複散
射理論(multiple scattering theory)和連續減能近似法(continuous slowing down 
approximation)，以求得角度的偏折和能量的損失。 
 
4.1.3 模擬狀態 
 
    本研究模擬氚在細胞核中對細胞核造成之能量沈積，此；模擬假設細胞核的
半徑為 1µm，細胞核內的材質為水，氚均勻分佈在細胞核中，射源是等向性的發
散，模擬的結果可以得到線性能量及對應的線性能量分佈，進而求得頻率平均線
性能量、劑量平均線性能量、與相對生物效應。 
 
4.2 奈米劑量學 
 
4.2.1 模擬程式 
 
  本實驗室所開發的奈米劑量專用之蒙地卡羅程式 NMC(Nano Monte Carlo) 
(6)，可模擬奈米劑量的參數。此程式是模擬低能量電子作用的經歷(history)，除
了考慮電子彈性碰撞引起的散射現象外，並且考慮非彈性碰撞作用造成的能量損
失。利用 NMC 來詳細追蹤每顆電子在物質中行進的軌跡和損失的能量，即可求
得本研究想要的參數。 
 
4.2.2 模擬狀態 
 
  本研究主要模擬氚分佈在細胞核內對 DNA 造成之雙股斷裂的機率，假設細
胞核半徑為 1µm，細胞核內都是水，模擬的模型是電子射源放在球心的位置，射
源發射的方向都是等向性的向外發散，而感興趣的生物靶區就是圍繞著射源的球
體內。由於 DNA 在細胞核內是隨機分佈的，無法得知 DNA 實際的位置，但因
氚在細胞核內是均勻分佈，所以能知道 DNA 是被氚所包圍著。在模擬過程中，
可逐漸增加球體的體積來得到符合本研究假設，所造成 DNA 雙股斷裂條件的次
數。隨著球體體積的增加，造成 DNA 雙股斷裂的次數也會增加，此結果可以畫
成一個曲線圖。接下來把這曲線作微分並畫圖，便可以得到當氚跟 DNA 之間距
離不同時，造成 DNA 雙股斷裂機率的影響，藉此可判斷當氚與 DNA 之間距離
為多少時，會最容易對 DNA 造成傷害。

  利用模擬之線性能量的分布，可求得不同靶區大小 RBE 值的變化，如下式： 
 
 
                                                            (5.1) 
 
 
其中 d(y)是線性能量的劑量分佈，r(y)是與線性能量有關的生物權重函數。要利
用(5.1)式求得 RBE 值，可使用圖 5.2 的結果，圖中右邊曲線是利用老鼠胸線作
實驗得到之線性能量與生物權重函數的關係圖，左邊曲線則是模擬求得之線性能

  圖 5.3 是求得之 RBE 值與靶區大小的關係圖。由圖結果可知，RBE 值隨著
靶區半徑增加而逐漸減少，當靶區半徑大小約為細胞核半徑 1 µm 時，RBE 值約
等於 1。

    若在模擬的過程中，加入了彈性碰撞的作用，圖 5.6 之結果顯示彈性碰撞造
成 DNA 雙股斷裂事件的變化。圖中彈性碰撞之所以增加了 DNA 雙股斷裂的機
會，是因為彈性碰撞會造成電子角度改變，以致電子軌跡有彎曲的現象(若無彈
性碰撞，電子的軌跡便是直線的)，此軌跡差異會造成：(i)彎曲的軌跡使得電子
在靶區中發生較多次的非彈性作用，(ii)彎曲的軌跡也使得能量沈積事件間的距
離變得比較近，較易造成 DNA 雙股斷裂。圖 5.7 可以看出，考慮了彈性碰撞後， 
DNA 雙股斷裂的機率會隨著氚與 DNA 之間的距離增加而減少。

Methods B (附件二)(9)。 
 
七．結論與建議 
   
  從微劑量學的觀點得知，當氚均勻分佈在生物效應之靶區時，其頻率平均線
性能量、劑量平均能量、RBE 值，皆隨靶區半徑的增加而減少，此因靶區體積
增加雖然使得能量沈積增加，但靶體積的平均弦長也增加，而線性能量等於能量
沈積除以平均弦長，故導致靶區半徑增加而線性能量卻逐漸減少，當然頻率平均
線性能量、劑量平均能量、RBE 值都會相對減少。 
   
  以奈米劑量學觀點得知，氚造成 DNA 雙股斷裂的機率主要與氚至 DNA 的
距離有關。隨著兩者之間距離的增加，氚造成 DNA 雙股斷裂的機率就會逐漸減
少，如此可推論當氚鍵結在 DNA 分子上時，最容易對 DNA 造成傷害。本研究
還探討彈性碰撞與二次電子對 DNA 雙股斷裂的影響，發現兩者皆會增加氚對
DNA 雙股斷裂的機率，尤其是二次電子的影響最大。 
 
  本研究使用兩種 DNA 模型，評估 DNA 雙股斷裂的影響。本報告所用的 DNA
模型比較粗糙，並且沒有考慮間接作用(indirect action)對於 DNA 雙股斷裂的影
響。而附件一中使用的模型，則對 DNA 的幾何結構加以改善，並且加入了間接
作用的影響。

th.DNA damage by calculations using basic physical and
chemical data [5]. Such calculations, based on the biophys-
ical models, have advanced signiﬁcantly through the
availability of computer codes in simulating electron inter-
actions [6]. These simulations have progressed from the
consideration of direct action [7] to the inclusion of indirect
action [8], both contributing to the DNA damage in the
forms of ssb and dsb. Models of DNA in varying degrees
of sophistication were built. The simpler and widely used
model, representing a segment of DNA in the form of
cylindrical volumes [9], was constructed from a central core
(representing the paired nucleobases) and two arches (each
representing the backbone of the strand). This model was
generally used to obtain frequencies of the energy deposi-
tions in a DNA nanometric volume without a priori infor-
mation on the atomic structure. Complicated DNA models
have also been available [10,11] for the study of DNA
damage.
The purpose of the present work was not aimed to con-
duct a full simulation using a complex model in the study
of DNA biological damage. Instead, a nanodosimetric cal-
culation of the energy deposition in a nanometric volume
of a simple DNA model was made to analyze the eﬀective-
ness of low-energy electrons in deriving strand breaks at
various geometrical and irradiation conditions. An event-
by-event Monte Carlo (MC) program was developed to
simulate the transport of low-energy electrons in liquid
water which contained the DNA model. The DNA duplex
was modeled by a representation of the sugar phosphates
with two parallel cylinders, of diameters 0.5 nm, height
16 nm, and separation 1 nm. An energy deposition in the
cylinder with a magnitude greater than 17.6 eV [9] was
assumed to cause a ssb by direct action. An energy deposi-
tion of 12.6 eV [12] or greater in liquid water within 0.5 nm
from the cylinder surface was assumed to induce an OH
radical which had a probability of 0.13 [13] to produce a
ssb by indirect action. When two ssbs occurred on opposite
strands separated by 10 or fewer base pairs, a dsb was
assumed. This program was applied to calculate the yields
of energy deposition events, ssbs and dsbs, all including
direct and indirect actions. These calculations provided a
basis for the quantiﬁcation of initial DNA damage and
for an insight into factors aﬀecting the eﬀectiveness of
low-energy electrons. Although such calculations provided
only approximate data regarding, for instance, water
radiolysis, the simpliﬁed approach yielded the essential
information on all physical processes and, therefore, con-
tributed to the understanding of DNA damage.
Because MC simulations involved the manipulation of a
large number of cross sections, various models were devel-
oped in the present work for the calculations of the diﬀer-
ential and integrated cross sections for elastic (with atomic
nuclei) and inelastic (with valence and inner-shell electrons)
interactions. Basically, the electron inelastic diﬀerential
inverse mean free path (DIMFP) was calculated using the
232 C.J. Tung et al. / Nucl. Instr. and Medielectric response function for valence-band excitations
and the generalized oscillator strength for inner-shell ion-izations. For valence-band excitations, an extended Drude
dielectric function [14] was ﬁtted to optical data and
checked by sum rules. For inner-shell ionizations, the gen-
eralized oscillator strength was calculated from a sum-rule-
constrained binary-encounter model [15]. The inelastic
DIMFPs were then calculated using the quantum-mechan-
ical Born approximation by including the exchange eﬀect.
Electron elastic diﬀerential cross sections were calculated
using the phase-shift analysis method [16].
This paper presents data on modeling the DNA damage
by low-energy electrons to study an insight into factors
which determine the biological eﬀectiveness. Data are pre-
sented for the yields of deposition events on the DNA
model and of ssbs and dsbs in diﬀerent complexities. The
classiﬁcation of ssbs by complexity was made according
to one deposition event on a single strand (ssb) and more
than one deposition events on a single strand (ssb+). Sim-
ilarly, the classiﬁcation of dsbs by complexity was made in
terms of one deposition event on each paired strands
(dsb), a dsb and one or more deposition events on a
single strand (dsb+), and two or more dsb (dsb++).
These clustered classes in varying complexity could deter-
mine the repair processes of DNA and lead to diﬀerent bio-
logical outcomes [13]. Data are also presented for the
variation of the yields in ssbs and dsbs with electron ener-
gies and source positions.
2. Methods
As an energetic electron travels in a medium, it interacts
with the medium through elastic and inelastic interactions.
In the case of elastic interaction, the atomic form factor
[17] is used to calculate the elastic diﬀerential cross section.
For inelastic interaction with a condensed medium, elec-
trons in the medium may be divided into two groups; that
is, the valence-band and inner shells groups. Inelastic inter-
action with the valence band leads to a single-electron
excitation or collective plasmon excitation. A dielectric
response theory is often adopted to compute the inelastic
diﬀerential inverse mean free path (DIMFP). Inelastic
interaction with the inner shell results in core electron ion-
ization or excitation. An atomic model for the generalized
oscillator strength (GOS) [15] may be applied to calculate
the inelastic diﬀerential cross section. In all model calcula-
tions, it is generally assumed that inelastic interaction alters
only electron energy but not electron direction. On the
other hand, elastic interaction changes only electron direc-
tion but not electron energy.
A water molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms
and an oxygen atom. In the gaseous phase, orbital elec-
trons of hydrogen and oxygen have the binding energies
of 20.7, 1.25, 0.62 and 0.5 au for O-1s, O-2s, O-2p and
H-1s sub-shells, respectively [18]. Note that atomic units
(au) are used throughout unless otherwise speciﬁed. In
the condensed (liquid or solid) phase, tightly bound O-1s
in Phys. Res. B 262 (2007) 231–239electrons form the inner shell, while other electrons form
the valence band owing to their strong correlations and
th.scheme based on the Møller formula of the DIMFP. The
exchange-corrected DIMFP is given by [27]
lexðE;xÞ ¼ liðE;xÞ þ liðE;E  xþ x0Þ
 ½liðE;xÞliðE;E  xþ x0Þ1=2; ð5Þ
where x0 = 10.06 eV is the ionization energy of liquid
water [28]. In this case, the minimum and maximum allow-
able energy transfers are x0 and (E + x0)/2.
The energy loss function of the O-1s inner shell may be
given in terms of the atomic GOS. In general, the GOS of
the ith inner shell is related to the energy loss function of
the nearly isolating system through [29]

where ni is the electron density of the ith inner shell and Z is
the atomic number. In the present work, a sum-rule-con-
strained binary-encounter model [15] developed previously
is applied to calculate the GOS for the O-1s shell. This
model involves the use of three sum rules to constrain the
parameters in the GOS of the classical binary-encounter
theory in order to extend the theory to any momentum
transfers. The results of applying this model to low Z mate-
rials are very good when compared with the quantum-
mechanical data of the Hartree–Fock model. Eqs. (4) and
(6) may then be used to calculate the ionization cross sec-
tion of the O-1s inner shell.
As a result of energy transfers to the medium electrons,
delta-rays (secondary electrons capable of additional
inelastic interactions) may be ejected. These delta-rays also
contribute to the energy deposition. It is assumed that
delta-rays are emitted with initial kinetic energies equal
to the energy transfers subtracting the binding energy.
The directions of motion of delta-rays are assumed uni-
formly distributed or randomized [30]. Electron transport
in the medium follows, interaction by interaction, the his-
tory of all fast and secondary electrons until their energies
are below a cutoﬀ energy of 12.6 eV.
An additivity rule is applied to determine the elastic
cross section of the water molecule; that is, rH2O ¼
2rH þ rO. This rule is valid because atomic nuclei are fairly
independent of each other. Previously [16], electron elastic
cross sections were calculated using phase-shift analysis
and the ﬁnite-diﬀerence technique for solid atoms with
the Hartree–Fock–Wigner–Seitz potential in the Dirac
equation. Such calculations provided very accurate data
for low-energy electrons. In the present work, the same
approach was followed to calculate electron elastic diﬀeren-
tial cross sections but with scattering potentials for
hydrogen and oxygen atoms derived from the Hartree–
Fock–Slater electron densities [31].
The present study of low-energy electrons interacting
with DNA in liquid water is made using a simple DNA
model for diﬀerent irradiating geometries. The naked
234 C.J. Tung et al. / Nucl. Instr. and MeDNA model consists of two parallel cylinders, of diameter
0.5 nm, height 16 nm; 0.32 nm for each base pair and sep-aration 1 nm, to simulate a segment of sugar-phosphate
backbones. The DNA model is placed in a large water vol-
ume to allow simulations of the entire electron tracks and
to preserve conditions of the electron equilibrium. The
water between cylinders represents the volume of the com-
plementary paired nucleobases. This model does not take
into account the detailed atomic structure of DNA. Elec-
trons are assumed to be emitted from a point on the plane,
at half height of cylinders, perpendicular to the cylinders
and along a line joining the two cylindrical axes. Calcula-
tions are made for electron emitters located at various posi-
tions along the line (see Fig. 9). A similar model has been
used [13] to obtain frequencies of the energy deposition
without a priori assumptions of the atomic structure in
determining the biological responses. An energy deposition
greater than 17.6 eV [9] in the cylinders is assumed to cause
a ssb by direct action. This value is obtained from modeling
the fragment length distributions for decays of 125I in plas-
mid DNA [32]. For indirect action, only OH radicals are
considered since hydrogen atoms and hydrated electrons
do not cause any appreciable strand breaks [13,33]. When
an OH radical reaches the vicinity of a DNA target atom,
within the sum of the reaction radii of the two, it is
assumed that they react. The reaction radii of DNA com-
ponents, i.e. adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine, are
0.12, 0.29, 0.30, 0.29 and 0.43 nm, respectively [33,35].
Considering these reaction radii and the diﬀusion of OH
radicals, it is assumed that an energy deposition greater
than 12.6 eV [12] in the cylindrical shells of 0.5 nm thick-
ness [34] around the sugar-phosphate cylinders is required
for a such reaction. The probability of this reaction causing
a strand break is set to 0.13 [13]. This value is derived from
the experimental interpretation of damage distribution
between the sugar phosphate and the nucleobases [32].
Other experiments give the probability for the formation
of the strand break per OH radical as 0.12 [36]. When
two ssbs occur on opposite strands separated by 10 or
fewer base pairs, a dsb is assumed to occur. An event-by-
event MC code is developed for the simulation of electron
tracks and energy depositions in liquid water. This code
follows, interaction by interaction, the history of all pri-
mary and secondary electrons until their energies are below
the cutoﬀ energy, i.e. 12.6 eV, for any possible direct or
indirect action. This code enables one to register the spatial
coordinates of each interaction and the energy depositions.
After simulating a signiﬁcant number of emitted electrons,
the probability distribution of the energy deposition in the
target volume is obtained.
3. Results and discussion
The dielectric responses of liquid water and DNA are
quite similar, as shown in Fig. 1, for a comparison of the
energy loss function in the optical limit. The dashed and
dotted curves are the optical data for liquid water [21]
in Phys. Res. B 262 (2007) 231–239and solid DNA [37], respectively. Note that there are diﬀer-
ent optical data sets available [21,38,39] for liquid water.
th.236 C.J. Tung et al. / Nucl. Instr. and Mebackscattered electrons irradiate the target volume more
than once [44].
There are diﬀerent ways to depict the results from MC
simulations of electron energy depositions in the DNA
model, for instance [13,33], the number of deposition
events, the number of ssbs or dsbs, and the complexity of
ssbs or dsbs. An illustration of these depictions is made
in Fig. 5. Here it shows the electron source (black dot on
the far-end of the right-strand surface) and the DNA model
(dark and light cylinders for direct and indirect actions).
Electrons emitted from the source may induce energy depo-
sition events in diﬀerent regions of the DNA model. A
deposition event is assumed from either an energy deposi-
tion of greater than 17.6 eV in the sugar phosphate or an
OH radical in the region of indirect actions with a proba-
bility of 0.13 of causing the strand break. As classiﬁed in

dsb). This classiﬁcation of strand breaks has been applied
in biophysical modeling that as the complexity of strand
breaks increases, the DNA damage becomes less repairable
and hence more likely to lead to biological consequences
[13]. Although it is not shown explicitly in Fig. 5, elastic
interactions and secondary electrons contribute to the
energy deposition events.
Fig. 6 shows the simulation results for the average num-
ber of deposition events per electron emission for an isotro-
pic electron source indicated in Fig. 5. Here R(1), R(2),
R(3+) and R(all) are the contributions from, respectively,
one, two, three and more, and all deposition events on
the R-strand. Similarly, L(1), L(2), L(3+) and L(all) are
the contributions from corresponding deposition events
on the L-strand. Since the source is closer to the R-strand,
it is seen that the average number of deposition events on
the R-strand is greater than that on the L-strand. As the
number of deposition events increases, the probability of
their occurrence becomes small. The average number of
deposition events reaches a maximum value for electrons
at 125 eV on the R-strand, where the inverse mean free
path reaches a peak (see Fig. 3), and 250 eV on the
L-strand.

An event-by-event MC simulation program was devel-
oped to simulate electron transport in liquid water and
the energy depositions in nanometric volumes. This pro-
gram was applied to a DNA model using elastic and inelas-
tic cross sections obtained from model calculations. Both
direct and indirect actions on the sugar phosphate of the
DNA model were included. Simulated results were pre-
sented by the number of deposition events, ssbs and dsbs
per electron emission for diﬀerent source positions around
the DNA model. Registrations and analyses of simulated
results were made in terms of the complexity of ssbs and
dsbs. It showed that electrons emitted from the strand cen-
ter were most eﬀective in deriving the dsb, with a maximum
yield of 3% per electron emission at 200 eV energy. At
ulation results. The present simulations may be extended to

pared to the same value obtained elsewhere. It also showed
that in this case 49% of dsb were of complex forms (dsb+
and dsb++), compared to 28% obtained elsewhere. Note
that values of other work were calculated from the diﬀerent
DNA model using diﬀerent interaction cross sections.
In the present work, base damage resulted from direct

The inclusion of base damage should add an additional
complexity to the forms of ssb and dsb. To obtain a more
realistic assessment of the complex DNA damage, an
attempt to include base damage will be made in the future
simulations. More recently [45,46], it was indicated that
DNA strand breaks could be induced by electrons at ener-
gies below the ionization energy. Reactions of sub-ioniza-
tion electrons could cause rapid decays of transient
molecular resonances in the DNA basic components to
induce ssb and dsb. Models for such reactions will also
be considered in the future simulations. In addition, a
reﬁned DNA model is being incorporated into the simula-
tions to account for the realistic DNA structure although it
is not anticipated a signiﬁcant change to occur in the sim-
in Phys. Res. B 262 (2007) 231–239202.

1. Introduction
     In internal radiation dosimetry, the radiation dose from internal radionuclide is 
usually expressed in terms of the mean absorbed dose to an organ or tissue. The mean 
absorbed dose to a target organ per nuclear transformation of the radionuclide in a source 
organ was determined both by the International Commission on Radiological Protection 
(ICRP) [1] and the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee of the Nuclear 
Medicine Society [2]. Internal radionuclide, however, may not be uniformly distributed
in the cell of the organ or tissue. In this case, the mean absorbed dose to a subcellular 
target per nuclear transformation of the radionuclide in a subcellular source, i.e. the 
specific cellular dose, is of interest particularly for short-ranged particles.  For instance, 
the specific cellular dose or the cellular S-value has been calculated by MIRD [3] for 
electrons and alpha particles assuming source regions: whole cell (C), cytoplasm (Cy), cell 
surface (CS), and cell nucleus (N) and target regions: C and N.  Since a deterministic 
method was used, uncertainties of the calculated results were not predicted.  These
uncertainties are due to the statistical fluctuation of the energy deposition, referred to as 
the energy loss straggling [4], for a given pathlength of particles traversing in the target 
region.  Also, elastic interactions contribute to such uncertainties due to the increase in 
particle pathlengths [5]. These uncertainties could be significant for electrons 
particularly of low energies.  Furthermore, the specific cellular dose represents the mean 
absorbed dose from a large number of deposition events.  The understanding of the 
radiobiological effectiveness requires information on the energy deposition from a single
event, i.e. the lineal energy, which characterizes the radiation quality [6,7].
     Specific cellular doses may be computed using different approaches, ranging from 
simple deterministic methods [3,8] to complex probabilistic or Monte Carlo (MC) 
simulations [9].  A combination of deterministic and probabilistic approaches may also 
be employed.  All these approaches make use of the differential cross sections for elastic

This code, however, cannot be applied accurately to electrons of energies less than a few 
hundred eV because of its generic inelastic cross sections employed.  In the present work, 
specific cellular doses calculated for electrons of different energies and source-target 
geometry using probabilistic and mixed methods were compared with one another and 
analyzed.  In addition, the lineal energy distribution and its associated mean 
(frequency-mean and dose-mean) values were also calculated and analyzed for the 
dependence on target dimension from nano- to micro-meters.  The dose-mean lineal 
energy, a microdosimetric analogue of the dose-mean linear energy transfer (LET), gives
an indication of radiation quality in the assessments of biological effectiveness.
     Most applications of specific cellular doses and lineal energies involved weakly 
penetrating particles emitted from the non-uniform source distribution in a cell.  For 
example, absorbed dose to the cell nucleus due to the protein-bound tritium was
previously calculated for newborn mice whose mother was ingested 
3
H-thymidine during 
the pregnancy [15,16].  A compound biological effectiveness (CBE) was estimated from 
the lineal energy distribution of D-particles and 7Li-ions, produced in the boron neutron 
capture therapy (BNCT), in the subcellular target [17].
2. Methods
In internal dosimetry, radiation dose and radiation quality are mostly expressed in 
terms of the absorbed dose and the LET.  The absorbed dose is generally specified in 
radiation protection as the specific effective energy (SEE) [1] and in nuclear medicine as 
the organ S-value [2]. The LET is a measure of the single-event energy deposition
excluding the energy loss to bremsstrahlung or delta-ray [18,19]. In cellular dosimetry, 
radiation dose and radiation quality may be expressed in terms of the cellular S-value, or 
the specific cellular dose, and the lineal energy.  The lineal energy is defined as the

In the mixed method, the deterministic range-energy relation and the MC sampling 
of electron tracks were employed.  The range-energy relation calculated in the current 
work is valid for electrons of energy down to ~ 10 eV in liquid water.  Its validity for 
low-energy electrons is because experimental dielectric function data were used, sum rules
were applied, and exchange and correlation effects were included.  A detailed discussion 
on theoretical calculations of the inelastic mean free path and the range-energy relation 
has been given elsewhere [13].  Other calculations using dielectric functions are also 
available [19,22,23]. The dielectric model calculations provide more accurate data than 
the single-pole results of the Penelope code.  To compare inelastic cross sections between 
dielectric model calculations and single-pole results, a brief summary of the dielectric 
model is described below.  The differential inverse mean free path (DIMFP) for an 
electron of energy E to lose the energy Z, i.e.  ZP ,E , may be calculated from the 
dielectric function  ZH ,k under the Born approximation, where k and Z are the 
momentum and energy transfers.  The dielectric function may be constructed by 
considering the valence band as composed of several groups of valence electrons with 
different oscillator strengths, binding energies, and damping coefficients.  This dielectric 
function is fitted to the optical data of liquid water in the optical limit, i.e. 0ok , to 
determine fitting parameters.  The fitted dielectric function is then extended to the 0zk
region by applying an asymptotic dispersion relation in the Bethe ridge.  The exchange 
effect is included with reference to the Møller DIMFP [21,24].  With DIMFP, electron
CSDA range may be calculated [25].
The specific cellular dose to a target region, RT, from radionuclide in the source 
region, RS, in a cell may be calculated from

Here Dy , an important parameter describing radiation quality for assessing the biological 
effectiveness, is a microdosimetric analogue of the dose-mean LET. For instance, the 
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements has recommended a 
mean quality factor, Q , based on a linear relationship with Dy [26].  Further, the 
relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of electrons with different energies was estimated 
using the ratio of Dy for these electrons to Dy for 36 keV electrons [27].  In the 
present work, the lineal energy distribution and the frequency- and dose-mean lineal 
energies were calculated for a spherical cell of various source-target geometry.  Similar
calculations were made for a sub-cellular target of nanometer dimension applicable to the 
DNA.  In this case, DNA was assumed randomly located in the cell nucleus where 
electron source was uniformly distributed in it.  Under this assumption, the distance 
between source and target could be any value up to the diameter of cell nucleus.  It was 
therefore interesting to study the dependence of lineal energy on the separation between 
source and target and on the dimension of the target.
3. Results and Discussion
Dielectric functions of the extended Drude model were fitted to optical data of 
liquid water [28] to determine the fitting parameters in the dielectric functions.  Fitted 
results were then verified by checking the sum rules [29].  Values of fitting parameters 
were previously published [13].  Using these dielectric functions, the DIMFP of electrons 
in liquid water was calculated.  Figure 1 shows a plot of the DIMFP from present
calculations (solid curve) for 1 keV electrons in liquid water as a function of energy loss.

using range-energy relation and electron track sampling.  Column D provides the results 
of current calculations for the probabilistic method using Penelope code, however, without
elastic interactions.  Column E lists the results of current calculations for the probabilistic 
method using Penelope code with elastic interactions.  In columns D and E, uncertainties 
of the specific cellular doses are expressed in terms of the standard deviation (in 
parentheses).  Note that the lowest electron energies available in MIRD and Penelope are 
1 and 0.5 keV, respectively.  These energies are, however, extended to 0.1 keV in the 
mixed method.  A comparison of the results between columns B and C indicates trivial 
differences, which validate the mixed method.  The deviation between results in columns 
C and D is due to the different cross sections, secondary electrons, and the CSDA.  This
deviation, expressed in percentage difference, is given under the column: (D-C)/D.  The 
deviation between results in columns D and E is due to elastic interactions.  Again, this
deviation, in terms of the percentage difference, is given under the column: (E-D)/D.  To 
analyze these deviations, Table 2 gives data on the fractional contribution from each type 
of energy depositions, i.e. insider, starter, stopper and crosser, to the specific cellular dose
using the Penelope code.  Here insider refers to the energy deposition of a charged 
particle emitted and ended inside the target region.  Starter, stopper and crosser refer to 
that, respectively, from inside to outside, outside to inside, and outside to outside the target 
region.  In this table, the backscatter contribution, i.e. for electrons traveling from inside 
to outside and then back to inside the target region, is also listed.  It is seen that for 
NN m the fractional contribution from insiders decreases from 99 % at 1 keV to 64 % 
at 10 keV.  This reveals that at 1 keV nearly all electron energy is deposited in N as 
insiders; but at 10 keV a sizable electron energy is deposited in N as starters and 
backscatters.  Since insiders correspond to the total energy deposition, no uncertainty on 
the energy deposition is resulted.  Therefore, it is conceivable that the more fractional 
contribution from starters and backscatters, the larger is the uncertainty of the specific

similar plot of the results for CyN m is shown in Fig. 6.  Here the distributions for 5, 
10, and 50 keV are mainly contributed from, stoppers, stoppers plus crossers, and crossers,
respectively.  Although the frequency- and dose-mean lineal energies, Fy and Dy , are 
frequently adopted to characterize the lineal energy distribution, the most probable value 
of this distribution, mpy , is also of significance.  This is especially true when the
distribution is skew or composed of delta peaks such as those shown in Figs. 5 and 6.  
Table 3 is the results of calculated Fy and mpy for different source-target geometry with 
RC = 5 Pm and RN = 2 Pm.  It is visible that in all cases electrons of 10 keV have the 
maximum values in their mean and most probable lineal energies than other electron 
energies.  This is because 10 keV electrons have a range close to the target mean chord 
length (see Fig. 2).
Since most radiobiological effects are initiated by the energy deposition in 
nanometer sized subcellular structures like DNA, the frequency- and dose-mean lineal 
energies in a sensitive volume of nanometer dimension were also calculated.  These 
mean lineal energies are plotted in Fig. 7 (Panel A) for different electron energies as a 
function of target radius from nano- to micro-meter scales.  Here electrons are assumed 
to be emitted from the center of a spherical target of different radii.  It is seen that the 
maximum values of mean lineal energies for 1, 5 and 10 keV electrons correspond to
target radii of several tens, hundreds and thousands nanometers, respectively.  Therefore, 
electrons of energy in the order of 10 keV have the maximum radiation quality for a 
cellular target of micrometer dimension.  Whereas, electrons of energy in the order of 1 
keV have the optimal radiation quality for a subcellular target of nanometer dimension.  
Panel B of Fig. 7 plots the ratio of Dy for a given electron energy to Dy for 36 keV in a 
spherical target with different radii.  This ratio serves as an indicator of the low-dose 
RBE for electrons of different energies [27].  It reveals that the maximum value of this

specific cellular dose.  In the current work, the specific cellular dose and its uncertainty
were estimated using MC simulations including the contributions from elastic interactions 
and secondary electrons.  It was found that for CyN m the relative uncertainty might be
quite large.
In addition to the specific cellular dose, the single event size or lineal energy is also 
of interest for the description of radiation quality.  The specific cellular dose relates to the 
mean energy deposition from all emitted electrons including those of zero energy 
deposition.  The lineal energy, however, describes the energy deposition from a single 
event excluding the zero energy deposition.  It was found that the lineal energy 
distribution varied substantially with electron energy, source-target geometry, and target 
size.  In the current work, the lineal energy distribution and the frequency- and 
dose-mean lineal energies in a subcellular target were calculated and analyzed.
The specific cellular dose and the lineal energy may be applied to the OBT internal 
dosimetry of low energy electrons.  They may also be applied to the BNCT cellular 
dosimetry of alpha particles and lithium ions.  These applications require data on the 
subcellular distributions of radiation sources, which are difficult to obtain.  More
applications of specific cellular dose and lineal energy need to be explored.
