Abstract 
    We observed ultrafast free exciton thermalization time of 700-900 fs and obtained the magnitude of 
maximal differential absorption to be 1.8×104 cm-1 with the pumping density of 10 µJ/cm2 by measuring 
transient differential transmission in a thin ZnO epitaxial layer at room temperature.  The largest induced 
transparency occurs near exciton resonance associated with absorption saturation by comparing the excitation 
from the above band-gap to band-tail states.  The pump dependent dynamics reveals transition of the excitonic 
relaxation from the exciton-phonon scattering into the exciton-exciton scattering.

二、緣由與目的 	  
    There has been great interest in optical properties of ZnO with the wide band-gap energy of 3.37 eV for the 
development of ultraviolet (UV) photonic devices.1  Due to its large exciton binding energy of 60 meV as 
compared with other wide band-gap semiconductors,2 such as ZnSe and GaN, free excitons exist in ZnO even at 
room temperature (RT).  Besides, its large nonlinear absorption has been investigated by the Z-scan method 
near two-photon exciton resonance in near IR and near exciton resonance in UV range.3,4  RT optical pumped 
UV spontaneous emission (SPE), stimulated emission and lasing have been reported in ZnO thin films grown on 
sapphire substrates.5,6  The SPE is attributed to both the free exciton and near-band-edge emissions, whereas, 
the stimulated emission and lasing are related to exciton-exciton scattering and electron-hole-plasma (EHP) 
depending on the optical pumping intensity. 
Transient absorption measurements have been commonly performed in GaN and related III-V materials on 
time scales of femtosecond (fs) to nanosecond (ns).7-9  For example, from the non-degenerate nanosecond 
pump-probe technique, GaN thin films reveal large optical nonlinearities associated with exciton saturation 
under high inter-band excitation.7  There are few studies on carrier dynamics in ZnO thin films and 
nanostructures by using transient absorption10,11 and time-resolved PL12-16 (TRPL) spectroscopy.  Yamamoto et 
al. measured the carrier dynamics in ZnO thin films,10 and observed the saturation of exciton absorption as well 
as the optical gain on the lower energy side of free exciton by using the non-degenerate pump-probe method 
with high band-to-band excitation density of 90 µJ/cm2.  On the other hand, by using the optical Kerr gate 
(OKG) method to study the TRPL in ZnO thin films with exciton resonance pumping density of 70 µJ/cm2, 
Takeda et al. reported that the formation of EHP takes less than 1 ps to build up.12   
For the best performance of ZnO-based UV photonic devices, such as high-speed photonic devices and 
optical switches, quantitatively investigating the dynamical behavior and optical nonlinear absorption near free 
exciton resonance is necessary.  In this work, besides the dynamics of the above band-gap states, the 
femtosecond degenerate pump-probe technique under resonant excitation was used to investigate free exciton 
thermalization by measuring the time-resolved differential transmission in a thin ZnO epitaxial layer at RT.  An 
ultrafast relaxation time of 700-900 fs and maximal absorption saturation can be observed at exciton resonance.  
The investigation of pumping dependent dynamics suggests transition of excitonic relaxation from 
exciton-phonon scattering into exciton-exciton scattering under increase in pump density. 
 
三、研究方法與步驟 	  
Our c-axis oriented ZnO thin film with thickness of 70-nm was grown on a c-plane sapphire substrate by 
high-vacuum pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with KrF excimer laser.  The detail growth apparatus and condition 
can be found in Ref. 17.  The absorption spectrum was measured at RT (~295 K) by using the spectral 
photometer (Jasco V-670) with resolution of 0.5 nm.  The time integrated PL excited by a frequency doubled 
 4 
excitation at 372 and 373 nm in Fig. 3 were achieved in use of three decay times as: 
A1exp(-t/τ1)+A2exp(-t/τ2)+A3exp(-t/τ3).  An ultrafast time constant τ1 of 0.82-0.85 ps can be obtained due to 
excitonic thermalization.  According to previous TRPL studies of EHP dynamics in ZnO thin films by using 
the optical Kerr gate method,12 the red shift of PL emission was observed with a time constant less than 1 ps 
during the build-up stage of EHP state.  Because the formation of EHP state is concerned about photo-excited 
enough carriers to achieve the Mott transition, the screening of Coulomb interaction and the band-gap 
renormalization effects need to be considered during the relaxation process.  However, we pumped the sample 
here with lower excitation density and monitored the intrinsic non-equilibrium excitonic state.  Thus, the 
reported ultrafast relaxation time of 0.82-0.85 ps is mainly due to the thermalization process through 
exciton-phonon or exciton-exciton scattering.  Furthermore, the time constant τ2 of 8.46-8.95 ps should be 
predominately caused by the non-radiative channels, such as trapping by defects, multi-phonon emission, or 
Auger recombination.  And the time constant τ3 of 47.8-53.2 ps is attributed to the longer radiative lifetime, 
which is comparable to the previous TRPL studies that the spontaneous recombination time is on the order of 46 
to 110 ps in ZnO films grown by MBE and 30 to 74 ps in rf-sputtered films.15,16 
The maximal normalized differential transmission as a function of excitation energy from the above 
band-gap to the band-tail states was plotted in Fig. 4.  The largest induced transparency due to absorption 
saturation occurs at 372.5 nm (3.329 eV), corresponding to the free exciton transition, is consistent with the 
absorption spectrum in Fig. 1.  It can be obviously observed that the maximum of △T/T near the free exciton 
transition (372.5 nm) is five-times larger than the value near the band-gap state (365 nm) in Fig. 4, although 
their linear absorption coefficient is almost the same.  It is similar to the investigation of transient absorption 
in GaAs and ZnTe quantum wells at RT,24,25 that the bleached exciton absorption by excited resonant excitons 
is stronger than the same density of free electron-hole pairs.  It implies that the absorption saturation of free 
exciton via resonant excitation is more efficient than that of band-edge absorption due to not only inter-band 
transition but also free-carrier absorption.  Because the measured differential reflectivity (△R/R) is on the 
order of 10-3, whereas the measured differential transmission (△T/T) is on the order of 10-1, we neglected the 
change of reflectance and deduced the differential absorption from the differential transmission based on the 
equation of: Δα = − 1d ln(1+
ΔT
T )  
with  being the thickness of sample.  The value of △α is estimated to 
be -1.8×104 cm-1 near exciton resonance under 10 µJ/cm2 pumping that is comparable to the results measured in 
GaN at 10K and in GaAs at 15K measured with the differential transmission spectrum (DTS) by using the 
pump-probe technique.7,26 
In order to realize the mechanism of free exciton thermalization, we performed the pumping dependent 
dynamics and nonlinear absorption near exciton resonance.  Figure 5 shows the free exciton dynamics for 
three different pumping densities.  We found the ultrafast relaxation time on the order of 800-900 fs is almost 
independent of the pumping density under 1-20 µJ/cm2.  This ultrafast relaxation time is responsible for free 
exciton thermalization via exciton and phonon scattering.  However, the relaxation time slightly decreases to 
700-800 fs as increasing the pumping density to 30-50 µJ/cm2.  By using the optical Kerr gate measurements, 
previous TRPL studies reported the build-up of P-band emission with a time constant of 800 fs through 
exciton-exciton scattering in ZnO thin films.13  Consequently, the decrease of relaxation time with increasing 
pumping density supports the transition of excitonic thermalization from exciton-phonon scattering at low 
pumping into exciton-exciton scattering at high pumping. 
The negative differential absorption maximum as a function of pumping density is shown in Fig. 6.  The 
temporal regime of the measured differential absorption on the order of pulse duration is shorter than the 
relaxation process.  We can mainly attribute the negative differential absorption to the band-filling of 
resonantly excited excitons, while the screening effect from the free carriers via exciton-LO-phonon interaction 
may play a minor role.24,25  To estimate the saturation intensity, we fit the experimental results by using the 
absorption saturation model,27  
,           (1) 
where is the differential absorption maximum within the pulse duration,
 
 is the absorption coefficient 
without pumping, is the non-saturated portion of absorption and  is the saturation intensity.  We 
obtained = 0.65 and
 
= 25 µJ/cm2.  It means that about 35% of resonantly excited excitons contribute to 
the band-filling.  The value of negative differential absorption maximum shows a linear dependence of
