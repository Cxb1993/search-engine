ABSTRACT: Ecological engineering is a new multi-discipline engineering and design 
practice that emphasizes the stream restoration, slope stabilization, road construction, and 
soil and water conservation in an ecological perspective. The ecological engineering 
development has progressed rapidly in the recent years in Taiwan. Among the public-works 
projects undertaken in Taiwan, most were related to stream restorations, which include the 
stabilization of river banks, the construction of retaining structures (gabions), the use of 
vegetation to increase riparian habitats, and the application of soil bio-engineering to control 
erosion and surface runoff. Although the projects were viewed as successes, very little 
monitoring was conducted after the projects were completed for follow-up evaluation and 
assessment. To improve this situation, this study developed a stream eco-engineering monitoring 
and assessment system. Based on a geographic information system, this system uses Java-
enabled phones and digital cameras to conduct field investigations, and transmit the collected 
data back to the office via the Internet, 3G networks, or short message services (SMS) in real 
time. The results could then be accessed by manual browsing or a querying mechanism using 
JavaServer Pages (JSP) technology to generate simple and fast dynamic web contents. The 
potential use of the system is to provide system-based planning and decision support to officials 
in charge of public engineering projects based on continuous monitoring and an accumulated 
database. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Ecological engineering is a new multi-discipline engineering and design practice that 
emphasizes the stream restoration, slope stabilization, road construction, and soil and water 
conservation in an ecological perspective. The ecological engineering development has 
progressed rapidly in the recent years in Taiwan. In the past, Taiwan’s river-management 
efforts were usually coordinated with flood control/disaster prevention projects (Chen and 
Lin, 2004; Chen and Lin, 2005). Therefore, most engineering structures in the streams and 
rivers were designed using reinforced concrete to be durable and capable of withstanding the 
force exerted by floods. It was not until 1998, under the gradual influence of Europe, Japan, 
and the US, that the engineering community and the government began to embrace the 
practice of natural river restoration (Chen and Lin, 2004). This practice later extended to 
become ecological engineering practices, and the same practice was applied to almost all 
civil engineering disciplines such as slope stabilization, road construction, and soil and 
water conservation. Today, ecological engineering is used to solve a wide range of problems 
3.1 The Database Subsystem 
 
The SEEMAS uses a 3-tier architecture, which includes the front layer (presentation tier), the 
middle layer (application tier), and the back layer (data tier). The data tier was designed with an 
entity-relationship model and implemented using a relational database management system 
(RDBMS). The entities used in the RDBMS included the investigators, engineering projects, 
engineering structures, streams, ISCs, plants and animals, each with specified data properties 
and data relationships. Primary keys and foreign keys were also specified to connect related 
records held in different tables. Although the SEEMAS has different presentation tiers for 
different clients, they all connect and share the same database for data consistency.

(SEEMAS) 
 
3.2 The Data Collection Subsystem 
 
The data collection subsystem is a part of the presentation tier that also includes the data 
presentation subsystem (see below). The SEEMAS provides three different methods for field 
data collection—PDAs/laptops, Java phones, and short message services (SMS). When an 
investigator uses a PDA or laptop in the field, he can interact with the dynamic web pages 
generated by HTML and JSP. The historic data are brought to the PDAs/laptops and the 
collected data are sent back to the server and database in real time. When carrying a laptop to 
the field is not practical, the investigator can then use a Java phone uploaded with the custom 
SEEMAS Java program instead. The custom Java program provides the interactivity similar to 
JSP in the PDA/laptop example. However, the data do not flow between the user and the server 
until the data are ready to be submitted. Then, the data will be sent back to the server and posted 
to the database in a batch. The last method to collect field data is to use an ordinary cell phone 
with the SMS function. The user needs to text the data message in a special format and sends it 
 
3.4 The Data Transmission Subsystem 
 
Together with the application logic, the data transmission subsystem forms the middle layer. It 
provides connectivity between the data collection subsystem and the central server, and allows 
the information to be sent back and forth between the users and the database. Using the Java 
phone interface as an example, Figure 4 shows a sequence of screen shots that demonstrate the 
integrated process of data collection and transmission: (a) starting the Java program, (b) 
displaying the menu items, (c) displaying the login screen, (d) adding a new engineering 
structure, (e) inputting detailed information, (f) transmitting the data back to the server via SMS, 
(g) transmitting the data back to the server via JSP, (h) storing the data in the Java phone, and (i) 
completing the task.
