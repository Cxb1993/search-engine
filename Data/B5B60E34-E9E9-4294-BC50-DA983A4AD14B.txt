1. Introduction 
With the rapid evolution of an aging society in the developed countries and an increase in the 
demand of people with disabilities for full recognition of their civil rights, the concept of 
universal design is currently being applied to a variety of fields including architecture, landscape, 
and product design. Many facility managers have recognized the advantages of applying 
universal design in their workplaces and practice it at any level of application (Saito, 2006). 
Universal design is an approach to creating everyday environments and products that are usable 
by all people to the greatest extent possible, regardless of age or ability (Mace, 1985; Ostroff, 
2001; Story, 1997), or without the need for adaptation or specialized design (Center for Universal 
Design, 1997). It emerged from slightly earlier “barrier-free” concepts, the broader accessibility 
movement, and adaptive and assistive technology and also seeks to blend aesthetics into these 
core considerations. In practice, it is neither an assistant technology nor a euphemism for 
accessible design. Rather, universal design involves a fundamental shift in thinking about 
accessibility away from the practice of removing or overcoming environmental barriers for an 
individual or a particular group of people to a way of meeting the environmental needs of all 
users (Bednar, 1977). Universal design is regarded as a goal that puts a high value on both 
diversity and inclusiveness, maximizing the usability of products and environments (Story, 1998). 
Recently, researchers have worked on developing ways to incorporate the actual concept of universal 
design into the design process (Mueller, 2001; Preiser, 2001; Story et al., 2000; 2001). A group of 
experts in the area of universal design have developed a set of simple principles that allows a 
systematic assessment of new or existing designs and assists in educating both designers and 
consumers about the characteristics of more usable products and environments (Beecher & Paquet, 
2005; Center for Universal Design, 1997; Story, 1997; 1998). Since then, designers have become 
familiar with the unifying principles of universal design and have developed many products based 
on this paradigm (Demirbilek & Demirkann, 2004; Mamee & Sahachaisaeree, 2010). However, 
the principles of universal design are qualitative in nature. It is difficult to quantitatively assess 
whether a product is indeed a good example of universal design or not (Kato et al., 2009). 
Assessment is a systematic determination of merit, worth, and significance of something using 
criteria against a set of rules. It involves the human perceptual interpretation with certain 
uncertainty and imprecision. As such perceptual interpretation usually refers to the 
non-quantifiable, subjective, and affect-based process, it is difficult to be objectively explored by 
a conventional research approach, particularly using such qualitative criteria as universal design 
principles. Recent development on artificial intelligence methods offers a powerful tool to deal 
with concepts and rules with uncertainty and subjective vagueness, especially in real life 
situations where absolute precision has little relevance while a robust representation of relative 
trend is more valuable. Fuzzy set theory was advanced by Zadeh (1965). It launches a scientific 
revolution based on the premise that the key points in human thinking are not numbers, but linguistic 
terms (Bellman & Zadeh, 1970). During the past decades, numerous decision-making methods based 
on fuzzy set theory have been proposed and used (Baas & Kwakernaak, 1997; Kuo et al., 2006; Yang

Step 3. Conduct a universal usability testing. 
Universal usability refers to the design of products and services that are usable for every 
citizen, recognizing the diversity of user population and user needs. Usability testing focuses on 
measuring a human-made product’s capacity to meet its intended purpose. The purpose of the 
universal usability testing is to measure how well test subjects respond in the criteria of the seven 
universal design principles. The test subjects are divided into expert and user groups. Both groups 
of subjects are required to evaluate the selected product alternatives according to the universal 
usability testing results. A post-test questionnaire is then used to gather feedback on the products 
being tested. The evaluation grades are 7-point Likert scales, ranging from “strongly disagree” to 
“strongly agree”. Each Likert scale corresponds to a linguistic variable with a crisp number as 
given in Table 1.

Step 4. Determine a set of linguistic weight vectors for the criteria. 
The importance (weights) of the criteria is a critical factor in a decision-making process. It 
must be more objectively and equitably determined. Expert review is a general method of 
usability testing that relies on bringing experts in with their knowledge and experience in the 
professional field to evaluate the usability of a product. According to the testing results, experts 
evaluate the product alternatives through the Likert-type questionnaire. Substituting these scoring 
data into SPSS software to perform the Pearson distance correlation analysis in pairs, we can 
derive a proximity matrix that is regarded as a covariance matrix. Taking advantage of the 
eigenvalue algorithms, a set of values corresponding to the criteria is derived. These values are 
used as the weightings determined through the expert group’s judgments. They are latent 
numbers and must be converted into linguistic variables for the following aggregation operation.

3. Case study 
This section conducts an empirical study to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach. 
The aim of this experiment is to assess the most desirable alternatives from a set of selected products 
in terms of the universal design perspective. The experiment consisted of two parts: (1) a pilot test 
to determine the importance (weights) of the criteria, and (2) the universal design assessment for the 
selected product alternatives. 
3.1. Participants 
The empirical study involved 3 experts in the pilot test and 20 users in the universal design 
assessment. The experts were qualified with at least 5 years of personal work experience and are 
familiar with the unifying principles of universal design. A total of 20 subjects including 18 
able-bodied and 2 physically disabled (1 hearing-impaired and 1 right-forearm-impaired) users 
participated in the universal design assessment. These subjects consisted of 11 females and 9 males, 
ranging in age between 12 and 68 years (Mean=26.7, S.D.=12.53). 
3.2. Product alternatives 
Six handy staplers were selected as product alternatives to conduct the universal design assessment. 
The specifications of the product alternatives are listed in Table 2.

By calculating the absolute values of the eigenvectors corresponding to the maximum 
eigenvalue, we determined a set of the priorities of the principal diagonal elements. The obtained 
values were then converted into linguistic weight variables as listed in Table 4.

According to the usability testing results, the user group’s quantitative judgments with respect 
to the product alternatives were categorized and converted into linguistic preference variables as 
listed in Table 5.

Abstract 
As life expectancy rises and modern medicine increases the survival rate of those 
with significant injuries, illnesses, and birth defects, there is a growing interest in 
universal design. Universal design is an approach of developing products and 
environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible. Although a set 
of acknowledged principles has been developed and commonly used by industry and 
academic community, it is difficult to quantitativelyassess whether a product is indeed 
a good example of universal design. This study presents a fuzzy linguistic approach 
for universal design assessment. The proposed approach is based on fuzzy linguistic 
variables associated with the fuzzy weighted average techniques for aggregating 
preference information. To illustrate the practicability of the proposed approach, a 
case study using a simple hierarchy structure to assess product alternatives was 
conducted. It has shown a credible result.The fuzzy linguistic approach has proven to 
be useful in dealing with complex assessment problems involved in qualitative 
attributes.

particularly using such qualitative criteria as universal design principles.Recent 
development on artificial intelligence methods offers a powerful tool to deal with 
concepts and rules with uncertainty and subjective vagueness, especially in real life 
situations where absolute precision has little relevance while a robust representation 
of relative trend is more valuable.Fuzzy set theory was advanced by Zadeh(1965). It
launchesa scientific revolution based on the premise that the key points in human 
thinking are not numbers, but linguistic terms(Bellman &Zadeh, 1970). During the 
past decades, numerous decision-making methods based on fuzzy set theory have 
been proposed and used(Baas &Kwakernaak, 1997; Kuo et al., 2006; Yang et al., 
2008; Zimmermann, 1987).Van Laarhovenand Pedrycz(1983)first evolved Saaty’s
AHP into the fuzzy AHP to solve vague problems that occur during the analysis of 
criteria and judgment process. Many systematic approachesintegrated the concepts of 
fuzzy set theoryinto the AHP technique to solve imprecise hierarchical problems in 
the real-worlddecision making(Dağdeviren&Yüksel, 2008; Sun, 2010; Torfi et al., 
2010).Although the fuzzy AHP can deal with the uncertain comparisons using fuzzy 
scales and has largely been used in related research fields(Dağdeviren&Yüksel, 2008; 
Erensal et al., 2006; Lin, 2010), it is difficult to preservea consistent pairwise 
comparison to ensure the order of the preference intensities in the resultant 
priorities(䘔akır, 2008; Wang & Chen, 2008).
In modeling decision processes, preference relations are the most common 
representation of information used for solving decision-making problems.Generally, 
these preference relations can be categorized into multiplicative preference 
relations(Fan et al. 2006; Herrera et al., 2001), fuzzy preference relations(Berredo et 
al., 2005; Wang & Fan, 2007), and linguistic preference relations(Herrera & 
Herrera-Viedma, 2000; Xu, 2005).As mentioned above, the principles of universal 
design are characterizedasqualitativeparadigm.The decision situation in which the 
alternatives cannot be assessed precisely in a quantitative manner but may be in a 
qualitative one, thus the use of linguistic assessments is very appropriate(Delgado et 
al., 1992; Herrera et al., 1998). The fuzzy linguistic approach is an approximate 
technique which represents qualitative aspects as linguistic values by means of 
linguistic variables(Zadeh, 1975; 1976).In thispaper,a novel linguistic assessment
approach is presented, which can be used to assist decision makers in assessing
product design in terms of the universal design perspective. The remainder of this 
paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed linguistic assessment
approach. Section 3 presents a case study to illustrate the practicability of the 
proposed approach. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn in Section 4.

Step 4. Determine a set of linguistic weight vectors for the criteria. 
The importance (weights) of the criteria is a critical factor in a decision-making 
process. It must be more objectively and equitably determined. Expert review is a 
general method of usability testing that relies on bringing experts in with their 
knowledge and experience in the professional field to evaluate the usability of a 
product. According to the testing results, experts evaluate the product alternatives 
through the Likert-type questionnaire. Substituting these scoring data into SPSS 
software to perform the Pearson distance correlation analysis in pairs, we can derive a 
proximity matrix thatis regarded as a covariance matrix. Taking advantage of the 
eigenvalue algorithms, a set of values corresponding to the criteria is derived. These 
values are used as the weightings determined through the expert group’s judgments. 
They are latent numbers and must be converted into linguistic variables for the 
following aggregation operation. According to the interval of converting scales given 
in Table 1, we can determine a set of linguistic weight vectors . 
Step 5. Derive a set of linguistic preference vectors for the product alternatives. 
The concept of universal design focuses on how a product is usable by all people 
to the greatest extent possible. It is very important to take account of users’ 
participation in the assessment when conducting a universal design study (Sanford et 
al, 1998). In this step the priorities for the product alternatives with respect to each 
criterion are evaluatedby users through the usability testing and the post-test 
questionnaire. They judge the alternatives according to their actual experience and

Through the arithmetic operations, the family of α-cuts defined as a resultant 
membership function of the evaluated alternative can be presented in a membership 
function curve, and it also can be classified as a fuzzy number. In order to obtain a 
quantitative value of the resultant membership function, the center-of-gravity method 
known as “defuzzification” is used in this study. The formula of the center-of-gravity 
method can be expressed as below:

3. Case study 
This section conducts an empirical study to illustrate the implementation of the 
proposed approach. The aim of this experiment is to assess the most desirable 
alternatives from a set of selected products in terms of the universal design 
perspective. The experiment consisted of two parts: (1) a pilot test to determine the 
importance (weights) of the criteria, and (2) the universal design assessment for the 
selected product alternatives. 
3.1. Participants 
The empirical study involved 3 experts in the pilot test and 20 users in the universal 
design assessment. The experts were qualified with at least 5 years of personal work 
experience and are familiar with the unifying principles of universal design. A total of 
20 subjects including 18 able-bodied and 2 physically disabled (1 hearing-impaired 
and 1 right-forearm-impaired)users participated in the universal design assessment. 
These subjects consisted of 11 females and 9 males, ranging in age between 12 and 68 
years (Mean=26.7, S.D.=12.53). 
3.2. Product alternatives 
Six handy staplers were selected as product alternatives to conduct the universal 
design assessment. The specifications of the product alternatives are listed in Table 2.

According to the assessment results, we found that the best example is Alternative 
4 while the worst is Alternative 3. Alternative 3 has a cute hippo-like appearance but 
lacks for something about the universal usability. Alternative 4 is a flat-clinch stapler
that the staples are clinched flat on the back, reducing the risk of staple scratches. In 
addition, its twin-lever mechanism can cut stapling effort and reduce hand pain from 
repetitive stapling. Although Alternative 2 (Rank 2) also provides the same 
functionality, it is bigger and heavier than Alternative 4 so that it is less equitable and 
flexible for users to grip and use. As a whole, the universal design assessment has 
shown a credible result. 
4. Concluding remarks 
This study considers the aggregation operator as linguistic variables, and uses the 
fuzzy weighted average method to perform preference aggregation. In practice, the 
proposed approach not only considers both the relative important of the criteria and its 
achieved performance, but also conveys the influence of the evaluator’s evaluation 
attitudes. It can flexibly reflect any evaluator’s evaluation attitudes such as open, 
neutral or rigorous. In conclusion, the proposed approach can make an objective 
assessment that approaches a real decision making situation. It has the potential to be 
a useful decision-aiding tool for dealing with complex assessment problems. In 
addition to universal design, this fuzzy linguistic approach can be used to 
systematically assess alternatives from criteria relevant to a set of qualitative 
attributes.
