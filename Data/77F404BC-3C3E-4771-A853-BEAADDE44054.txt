Organic-inorganic hybrid materials can be applied as thin films with a wide different 
refractive index range. High refractive index poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-titania hybrid 
thin films have been prepared by the sol-gel method and showed excellent optical properties. 
However, their applications are limited because of the poor thermal stability of PMMA moiety. 
Therefore, a high-temperature polymer in preparing hybrids as optical or optoelectronic materials 
is essential. Polyimides have high thermal stability, chemical resistance, and excellent mechanical 
properties. Application of polyimides to waveguides has developed recently. However, poor 
adhesion of polyimides on the substrates restricts their applications. Polyimide-silica and 
polyimide-titania hybrid materials may solve this problem. 
Different polyimide-silica hybrid materials prepared from poly(amic acid)s (PAA), 
poly(amic ester)s (PAE), and organic soluble polyimides have been extensively studied. The 
aggregation of titania and the growth of particle size would cause more light scatting and make 
the film opaque. Thus control of morphology and phase separation is important in the preparation 
of transparent hybrid films. For this purpose, coupling agents should be used to form the 
hydrogen bonding and covalent bonding between the polymer and the inorganic moiety. 
However, studies of polyimide-titania hybrid materials are limited. Expectedly, without 
adding coupling agents opaque films were often obtained as the titania content was increased to 
more than 10 wt% because of the growth of titania particles. However, the content of titania is 
limited for another reason. The gel reaction from multifunctional acids of PAA with titanium 
alkoxides is very fast and results in the failure of preparing thin films by spin coating. To avoid 
the gel reaction by PAA, we used PAE and organic soluble polyimides to replace PAA for 
preparing polyimide-titania hybrid thin films.

Preparation of Polyimide-Titania Hybrid Thin Film from Soluble Polyimide 
 
The organic soluble polyimide based on 3,3',4,4'-benzophenone-tetracarboxylicdianhydride 
(BTDA) and 4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dimethyl-diphenylmethane (DMMDA) was prepared by a 
conventional two-step process. The condensation reaction between BTDA and DMMDA in DMF 
at room temperature for 4 hours gave a viscous poly(amic acid) solution, which was then 
converted to the required PI by imidization with excessive amounts of acetic anhydride and 
triethylamine at room temperature for 16 hours. A coupling agent aminopropyltrimethoxysilane 
(APrTMOS) and the titania precursor titanium isopropoxide (TPOT) were added to prepare 
BTDA-DMMDA/TiO2 hybrid thin films by a sol-gel reaction combined with a spin coating and 
multi-step curing process. Transparent hybrid thin films were obtained at a titania content as high 
as 40 wt%. The compositions of precursor solution and hybrid thin films are listed in Table 1, and 
the preparation scheme of BTDA-DMMDA/TiO2 hybrid thin films is showed in Figure 1

precursor titanium isopropoxide (TPOT) were used to preparing PMDA-ODA/TiO2 hybrid thin

titania content of the prepared hybrid thin films can approach to 40 wt%. The compositions of
