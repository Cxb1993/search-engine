Amphiphilic triblock copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA)?trifluoroethyl 
methacrylate (TFMA) and pentafluorostyrene (PFS) were synthesized by atom transfer 
radical polymerization (ATRP) in organic solvents using a Cu(I)X/2,2’-bipyridine 
catalyst system (X = Cl or Br) with poly(ethylene glycol) (Y-PEG 600-Y and Y-PEG 
400-Y), poly(tetramethylene ether glycol) (Y-PTMEG 2000-Y)(Y = Cl or Br), 
poly(propylene oxide) (Br-D2000-Br), poly(propylene oxide- ethylene oxide) 
(Br-ED2003-Br) and polycaprolactone (Br-PCL2000-Br) macroinitiator. Most of the 
amphiphilic triblock copolymers exhibited excellent solubility in various solvents such 
as chloroform, methylene chloride, benzene, toluene, xylene, N,N-dimethylacetamide 
(DMAc), pyridine, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The crystalline phase-transition 
temperatures of the amphiphilic triblock copolymers were determined by differential 
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and they were in the range of 18.2?23.2 . Amphiphilic ?
triblock copolymers with molecular weight up to    Mn  = 61,500, Mw = 90,700 and 
low polydispersities ( Mw/ Mn  = 1.16?1.51) were prepared. The temperatures of 10 % 
weight loss of these triblock copolymers were in the range of 255?355  and 254? ?
313 ? in nitrogen and air, respectively. GPC analysis of the triblock copolymers 
indicated no signal of residual macroinitiator and the monomer in the elution traces. 
Novel macroinitiators for ATRP, poly(NBMECl) and poly(HNBMECl), were 
derived from a difunctional monomer NBMECl, which was synthesized from the 
reaction of 5-(hydroxymethyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBCH2OH) and 
2-chloropropionyl chloride.  The highly stable macroinitiator, poly(HNBMECl), 
indicated better thermalstability than poly(NBMECl). The Td10 value of 
poly(HNBMECl) (Td10=331oC) is higher than poly(NBMECl) (Td10=286oC).  Novel 
comb-shaped copolymers such as poly(NBMECl-g-MMA)(Mn=1.41× 105) and 
poly(HNBMECl-g-MMA) (Mn=1.15×  105) were successfully obtained by combination 
of ROMP and ATRP. Novel macroinitiators and their comb-shaped copolymers showed 
excellent solubility in THF, pyridine, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, methylene chloride, 
chloroform, toluene, xylene, benzene, DMAc, NMP, and DMF.

Synthesis and Characterization of Macroinitiator Br-PEG 600-Br and Cl-PEG 600-Cl 
In Scheme 1, the synthesis of Br-PEG 600-Br and Cl-PEG 600-Cl is outlined. 
These macroinitiators were synthesized by coupling poly(ethylene glycol) to 
2-chloropropionyl chloride or 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide. The detail of experiments 
was presented in Experimental Section. Also, the structure of the macroinitiators was 
confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. The IR spectrum of Br-PEG 600-Br showed 
absorption bands at 1723 cm-1 (ester C?O stretching) and 1103 cm-1 (C?O?C 
stretching vibration), confirmed the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) and ester groups 
in the structure. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra and assignment of the signals for the 
macroinitiator Br-PEG 600-Br is depicted in Figure 1 and 2. In 1H NMR the hydroxyl 
group (?OH) disappears, and the new signals at 4.33 and 1.93 ppm appear for the 
Br-PEG 600-Br macroinitiators in CDCl3 after the esterification. To enable the 
hydroxyl groups to be completely substituted, the feed molar ratio of 2-chloropropionyl 
chloride or 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide to PEG was five times. Also, completely 
quantitative ester substitution was identified by integral values of signals at 4.33, 3.65, 
and 1.93 ppm of the macroinitiator Br-PEG 600-Br in 1H NMR. From the 1H NMR 
spectra of PEG 600 and Br-PEG 600-Br, the integral values at 3.65 ppm (peak 4) were 
around 9.90 and it is nearly the same. The integral value was around 3 at 1.93 ppm 
(peak 1) and 1 at 4.33 ppm (peak 2) for the macroinitiator Br-PEG 600-Br. So, these 
evidences can decide that the hydroxyl group is completely substituted and the 
macroinitiator is a difunctional initiator. The spectra agree satisfactorily with the 
proposed structure. 
 
Synthesis and Characterization of triblock Copolymers 
ATRP allowed the preparation of well-defined amphiphilic triblock copolymers 
via PEG-base and PTMEG-base initiator. The CuBr or CuCl/bipy catalyst system was 
used in the polymerization of MMA. The choice of the appropriate initiator/CuX (X =Br 
or Cl) system is a key parameter, when polymerizing monomer such as MMA with high 
observed propagation rate constants (kpobs = kqKeq according to the terminology defined 
by Matyjaszewski 60)) to avoid slow initiation (low observed initiation rate kiobs = kiKeq 
compared to kpobs) and/or possible side reactions.

macroinitiator (Br-PEG 600-Br) and triblock copolymers, Br-PMMA-b-PEG 
600-b-PMMA-Br, were presented in Figure 8.  The macroinitiator (Br-PEG 600-Br) 
and triblock copolymers showed a unimodal type of GPC curve (A) and (B) in Figure 8, 
respectively.  
 
Thermal Property 
The second DSC heating curves of amphiphilic triblock copolymers were shown 
in Figure 9. The crystalline phase-transition temperatures of the Br-PMMA-b-PEG 
600-b-PMMA-Br, Br-PMMA-b-PEG 400-b-PMMA-Br and Br-PMMA-b-PTMEG 
2000-b-PMMA-Br were 20.2, 18.2 and 23.2 ?, respectively. The crystalline 
phase-transition temperatures of amphiphilic triblock copolymers increase with 
increasing repeating unit of ethylene glycol.

Synthesis and Characterization of Macroinitiator Br-D2000-Br?Br-ED2003-Br and 
Br-PCL2000-Br 
In Scheme 3 and  4, the synthesis of Br-D2000-Br?Br-ED2003-Br and  
Br-PCL2000-Br is outlined. These macroinitiators were synthesized by coupling 
poly(propylene oxide) diamine, poly(propylene oxide- ethylene oxide) diamine and 
polycaprolactone diol to 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide. The detail of experiments was 
presented in Experimental Section. Also, the structure of the macroinitiators was 
confirmed by IR and NMR spectroscopies. The IR spectrum of Br-D2000-Br showed 
absorption bands at 1717 cm-1 (C=O) , 3318 cm-1 (N?H) and 1157 cm-1 (C?O?C), 
confirmed the presence of poly(propylene oxide) and amide groups in the structure. The 
1H NMR spectrum and assignment of the signals for the macroinitiator Br-D2000-Br,  
Br-ED2003-Br and Br-PCL2000-Br is depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In 1H NMR 
the amine group (?NH2) disappears, and the new signals at 6.99 and 1.95 ppm appear 
for the Br-D2000-Br macroinitiators in CDCl3 after the esterification. To enable the 
amine groups to be completely substituted, the feed molar ratio of 2-bromoisobutyryl 
bromide to D2000, ED2003 and PCL2000 was five to six times. So, these evidences can 
decide that the amine group is completely substituted and the macroinitiator is a 
difunctional initiator. The spectra agree satisfactorily with the proposed structure.

incorporation of the PFS and D2000 groups into the polymer backbone enhanced the 
thermal stability. Most of triblock copolymers were shown higher Td10 in nitrogen than 
in air atmosphere.

Synthesis and characterization of a new macroinitiator, poly(NBMECl) 
Ring-opening metathesis polymerization(ROMP) of NBMECl could be carried 
out under catalyst (I) and catalyst (II) system.  Influences of [M]/[I] ratio on 
polymerization time, molecular weight and polydispersity(PDI) of poly(NBMECl) were 
investigated.  The results of this investigation were summarized in Table 3. However, 
gelation was observed after ROMP of NBMECl with same monomer concentration by 
using Ru(II) catalyst.  By decreasing monomer concentration to 2×10-2 mole.l-1, an 
organo-soluble polyNBMECl with high molecular weight 8.46×104 could be obtained 
after 15 mins(entry 4, Table 3). However, the resulting polymer with broad molecular 
weight distribution was observed.  Hence, Ru catalyst (II) is not suitable to prepare 
macroinitiators because of broad polydispersity.  For catalyst I, the higher ratio of 
[M]/[I], the higher and other, the molecular weight and polydispersity would depends on 
ratio of [M]/[I].  The macroinitiator with narrow molecular weight distribution was 
obtained when the polymerization was carried out for 3 hours by using Ru catalyst(I) 
with low [M]/[I] ratio of 40.62)  1H and 13C NMR spectra analyses were carried out to 
confirm the chemical structure of poly(NBMECl).  In the 1H NMR spectrum of 
poly(NBMECl), the olefinic signals around ?5.90-6.20 ppm present in the monomer 
were disappeared and new signals due to olefinic hydrogen appeared around ?
5.19-5.33 ppm, corresponding to the hydrogen of double bond of the ring-opened 
polymer(cis/trans=86/14)[Figure 12(A)].  This confirmed the formation of 
macroinitiator [poly(NBMECl)]. 
 
 
Synthesis and Characterization of a new highly stable macroinitiator, 
poly(HNBMECl)  
Hydrogenation agent, p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide (TSH) was used as a

afforded gel- like insoluble products.  GPC curves of macroinitiator [poly(HNBMECl)] 
and grafted copolymers of poly(HNBMECl) with MMA were presented in Figure 7.  
The macroinitiator [poly(HNBMECl)] showed a unimodal type of GPC curve [Figure 
7(A)] whereas grafted copolymers exhibited bimodal type of GPC curve.  Similar 
bimodal nature in GPC curve of ethylene/vinyl acetate(EVA) copolymers grafted with 
acids has been observed earlier 66).  
The 1H NMR spectra of macroinitiators and grafted copolymers are presented in 
Figure 12.  The 1H NMR spectrum of comb-shaped copolymer obtained from grafting 
copolymerization of macroinitiator [poly(NBMECl)] and MMA exhibited signals at ?
3.58 ppm due to proton of OCH3 group , ?0.83-1.00 ppm due to proton of  PMMA 
segment, and the 13C NMR spectra also exhibited signals at ? 51.76 ppm due to 
carbon of  OCH3 group and ? 16.45-18.69 ppm due to carbon of PMMA segments.  
This observation confirmed the grafting copolymerization of macroinitiator with MMA.  
The 1H NMR spectrum of comb-shaped copolymer obtained from ATRP reaction of 
highly stable macroinitiator [poly(HNBMECl)] and MMA exhibited signals at ? 3.57 
ppm due to proton of OCH3 group , ? 0.81?0.99 ppm due to proton of PMMA 
segment, and the 13C NMR spectrum also exhibited signals at ? 51.72 ppm due to 
carbon of OCH3 and ? 16.43?18.64 ppm due to carbon of PMMA segments.  This 
observation confirmed the grafting copolymerization of highly stable macroinitiator 
[poly(HNBMECl)] with MMA and formation of new comb-shaped 
copolymer[poly(HNBMECl-g-MMA)]. Comb-shaped copolymer 
[poly(HNBMECl-g-MMA)] started decomposition at 190 ? due to PMMA segment 67) 
and subsequently poly(HNBMECl) segment underwent decomposition at high 
temperature. The comb-shaped copolymer showed low char yield. There is no 
observation of Tg in DSC curve of comb-shaped copolymer 
[poly(HNBMECl-g-MMA)]. 
Solubility of macroinitiators [poly(NBMECl) and poly(HNBMECl)] and 
comb-shaped coplymers [poly(NBMECl-g-MMA) and poly(HNBMECl-g-MMA)] was 
listed in Table 5.  All the macroinitiators and comb-shaped copolymers showed 
excellent solubility in organic solvents such as THF,  pyridine, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 
methylene chloride, chloroform, toluene,  xylene,  benzene, DMAc, NMP, and DMF.  
Particularly comb-shaped copolymers showed better solubility than the corresponding 
macroinitiators.

Received April 10, 2006; E-mail: cheket@nus.edu.sg
Polyimides (PIs) have been widely used in microelectronics,
owing to their excellent mechanical, dielectric, thermal, and
chemical properties.1 In recent years, PIs have also been explored
for applications in organic electronics, such as light-emitting diodes,2
photovoltaics,3 and xerography.4 Polymer memories exhibit simplic-
ity in structure, good scalability, low-cost potential, 3D stacking
capability, and large capacity for data storage.5 In the pioneering
works on polymer memories, polymers were used as polyelectro-
lytes, matrixes of dyes or nanoparticles, or components of charge
transfer (CT) complexes in doped or mixed systems.6-10 The design
and synthesis of polymers that can provide the required memory
properties within a single molecule is an alternative approach.11
Taking into account the demand for thermal stability in polymeric
materials,12 the present work explores a thermally stable PI for
memory applications. The present memory device is based on a
functional PI containing both electron-donor (D) and electron-
acceptor (A) moieties within a single macromolecule (TP6F-PI,
Figure 1). Differing from that of the widely reported nonvolatile
flash and write-once read-many-times polymer memories, the device
based on TP6F-PI exhibits dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) behavior.
The functional PI was synthesized by the reaction of 4,4′-
diaminotriphenylamine with hexafluoroisopropyl bis(phthalic di-
anhydride), to form the corresponding poly(amic acid).13 Imidization
gave rise to TP6F-PI with a number-average molecular weight of
4.16  104 and a polydispersity index of 3.70 (see Supporting
Information). TP6F-PI exhibited excellent thermal stability, with
a 10% weight-loss temperature of 524 °C and a glass transition
temperature of 316 °C. The memory device consisted of a NMP
solution spin-coated TP6F-PI film (50 nm in thickness) sand-
wiched between an indium-tin oxide (ITO) bottom electrode and
a 0.3 ím-thick Al top electrode (Figure 1).
The memory effect of TP6F-PI is shown in the current density-
voltage (J-V) characteristics of Figure 2. In the 1st sweep from 0
to 4 V, an abrupt increase in J was observed at a switching threshold
voltage of about 3.2 V, indicating the device transition from a low-
conductivity (OFF) state to a high-conductivity (ON) state (the
“writing” process). The device remained in this high-conductivity
state during the subsequent positive scan (the second sweep). The
distinct bielectrical states in the voltage range of 0 to 3.2 V allowed
a voltage (e.g., 1.0 V) to read the “0” or “OFF” signal (before
writing) and “1” or “ON” signal (after writing) of the memory. In
the third sweep from 0 to -4 V, an abrupt decrease in J was
observed at a threshold voltage of about -2.1 V, indicating the
device transition from the ON state back to the OFF state. This
electrical transition served as the “erasing” process for the memory
device. The device remained in the OFF state after this erasing
process, as indicated by the subsequent negative sweep (the fourth
sweep). The erased (“0”) state could be further written to the stored
(“1”) state when the switching threshold voltage was reapplied,
indicating that the memory device was rewritable (the fifth and
sixth sweeps). The seventh sweep was conducted after turning off
the power for about 1 min. It was found that the ON state had
relaxed to the steady OFF state without an erasing process. The
short retention time of the ON state indicated that the memory
device was volatile. However, the device could be reprogrammed
to the ON state (the seventh and eighth sweeps). The unstable ON
state could be electrically sustained by a refreshing voltage pulse
of 1 V in every 5 s (the ninth trace).
The J-V characteristics were repeatable with good accuracy,
and device degradation was not observed. The current magnitude
