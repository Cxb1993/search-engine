Statistical Evaluation of the amount of Re-
cordings 
 
In [1, 2], the authors detected target sources by 
comparing the discrimination between the target and 
non-target source activities based on statistical 
thresholding.  In this work, we expanded this con-
cept and evaluated the level of discrimination be-
tween the pre-defined active and control states in 
MEG recordings online.  The method is described 
as follows. 
For each MEG channel i, the mean ciμ is the 
average of the recordings im during the selected 
control period, cecs ttt L= . The mean aiμ is the 
average of the recordings during the selected active 
period, aeas ttt L= . 
 
For each channel, the data points during a 
specified time window (active state) are compared to 
those during the other time window (control state).  
By applying the statistical hypothesis to the selected 
control and active states from the recordings, we 
adopted paired t-test to examine the level of dis-
crimination between two states varied while the 
amount of acquired trials increased. From this varia-
tion, we can generate some reference indicators to 
help the experimentalist understand the amount of 
recordings. 
 
Head Motion Correction 
 
The head motion during MEG experiments will af-
fect the accuracy of source localization. A 
newly-proposed novel method, Stabilized Linear 
Model (SLIM) [3], can improve the localization ac-
curacy to solve the problem induced from head mo-
tion, instead of using motion correction [4, 5] which 
will cause information loss. By combining re-
cordings of different head poses, SLIM can not only 
reduce the error induced from head motion but si-
multaneously improve the accuracy of source local-
ization by conceptually increasing sensor numbers. 
The concept of SLIM is shown in Figure 1. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The details of SLIM algorithm is stated in the 
followings.  Assume that there are E epochs meas-
ured in an MEG study and there are N data samples 
collected for each epoch. Let jm be the SxN matrix 
that denotes the epoch j of recordings and S is the 
MEG sensor number, then 
Ejs jjj ,,1, L=+= nqLm   (3) 
where jL is the lead field matrix and s represents the 
dipole moment at each dipole location.  Thus the 
solution to the MEG inverse problem can be im-
proved by increasing the number of MEG sensors. 
In this work, we combined the stabilized linear 
model with our previous proposed source localiza-
tion method, Maximum Contrast Beamformer (MCB) 
[6], to achieve higher accuracy.  We modified Eq.(3) 
by qLl r=  where L is lead field matrix and l is 
lead field, we can get

With this linear model, we can virtually increase the 
sensor number of MCB model to get higher source 
localization accuracy and simultaneously to solve 
the problem caused by head motion.

basic modelling steps for MEG/EEG source estimation is a prerequisite, but possibly with 
limited technical understanding of the methodology involved.  
• Summarize the cutting-edge research questions and advances in MEG/EEG imaging, 
ranging from innovations in measurement technology to new models of neural sources 
and imaging approaches; 
• Clarify the similarities and differences between the main approaches to MEG/EEG 
source estimation (dipole fitting, beamforming and imaging approaches); 
• Identify a systematic workflow to group data analysis in MEG/EEG: from brain 
normalization to statistical inference at the group level; 
• Discuss emerging models and tools for the exploration of brain functional networks 
(coherent oscillatory activity, causal modeling within brain systems)

Introduction: Bipolar disorder is a severe mental disorder associated 
with impairments in the regulation of motivation and reward 
behaviors. Given that cortical delta oscillations depend on activity of 
neural structures involved in the motivation and reward systems, we 
hypothesized that delta oscillations will be increased in patients with 
bipolar disorders. The aim of this study was to verify the proposed 
hypothesis using magnetoencephalographic rhythmic signals during 
a resting state. 
 
Materials: Eight bipolar I patients and eight normal controls were 
recruited in this study. The patients were selected from outpatients of 
the Psychiatry Department of Taipei Veterans General Hospital. The 
clinical diagnosis was made by two independent psychiatrists using 
DSM IV criteria. The normal controls were age and sex matched 
with the patient group and underwent MINI interview before the 
experiments in order to exclude possible morbidity of major 
psychiatric illness. For each subject, 2-minutes eye-closed resting 
MEG data of 1 kHz sampling rate were recorded with a whole-head
