摘 要
本計畫旨在藉由嚴謹的數學推導，以及數值分析程式的建立，延伸與精進連續式極限
分析之泛用功能。我們先建立一般靜態或擬靜態塑性問題的陳述，亦即滿足平衡方程式、
邊界條件及遵循蒙密西斯降伏準則的材料組成律，自然地將其表示成極限分析的下限陳
述。為了便於利用基於位移(或速度)之有限元素方法，我們利用對偶定理，將以應力為變
數的問題下限陳述，轉換成以速度為變數的問題上限陳述。
在求解上限陳述之非線性問題時，我們採用一兼具平滑化及連續逼近的演算法，進行
非線性問題之線性化，並以有效率及精確地完成迭代計算。當然，我們也深具獨創性地引
用著名厚德不等式，嚴謹地驗證了此演算法的收斂性。
在計算案例方面，我們考慮一平面應變的厚壁中空圓柱結構，其材料具有應變硬化及
與應變率相依的性質，探討其承受內壓的塑性極限問題。如所周知，針對內壓作用之模擬
策略，我們有應力控制及位移(或速度)控制二種。經由本計畫研究結果，我們獲得對應於
此二種模擬策略的解析結果與數值分析結果。
不同於一般之完美塑性材料的極限問題，我們經由連續式極限分析之探討，呈現此一
非線性問題有趣之結構硬化及軟化之交互作用的現象，其中硬化現象來自於材料的應變硬
化性質，包括降伏強度飽和值與初始值的比值、應變硬化指數，而軟化現象則肇因於應變
率敏感指數。而隨著圓柱內徑之位移，其極限內壓之變化取決於此硬化及軟化因子之相對
大小。所得之分析結果並與本計畫推導的理論解作比較，嚴謹地驗證數值分析之準確性。
綜整本計畫執行結果，大致上已如預期地完成計畫之執行，不僅完成數理上之推導，

11. Introduction
Limit analysis is an efficient method to evaluate directly the load bearing capacity based
on simple material data (e.g. Huh and Yang, 1991). As it is well known, limit analysis is
applied effectively to bound rigorously the asymptotic behavior of an elastic-plastic material
by the lower bound or the upper bound theorem. However, if we consider structures made of
strain hardening viscoplastic materials, it may be more appropriate to evaluate the load
bearing capacity by limit analysis sequentially to reveal the interesting interaction between
strengthening and weakening behavior during the deformation process.
Theoretically, the equality relation between the greatest lower bound and the least upper
bound by duality theorems as demonstrated by Yang (1981, 1987, 1991a, 1993), Huh and
Yang (1991) mainly based on the generalized Hölder inequality (Yang, 1991b). Numerically,
it is possible to enhance the accuracy of limit analysis and extend its applicability to more
complex problems in engineering applications as presented by Anderheggen and Knöpfel
(1972), Bottero et al.(1980), Capsoni and Corradi (1997), Christiansen (1981), Corradi et al.
(2006), Dang Hung (1976), Hodge and Belytschko (1968), Li and Yu (2005), Jiang (1995),
Pastor et al. (200), Sloan (1989), Yang (1991a), Yu and Sloan (1994) and Zhang et al. (1994)
by the use of finite element methods (Reddy, 1993) together with mathematical programming
techniques (Luenberger, 1984).
Furthermore, efforts have illustrated extensively that sequential limit analysis is an
accurate and efficient tool for the large deformation analysis by Corradi et al. (2001), Corradi
and Panzeri (2004), Huh and Lee (1993), Huh et al. (1999) , Hwan (1997), Kim and Huh
(2006), Leu (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b), Leu and Chen (2006) and Yang (1993). By
sequential limit analysis, a sequence of limit analysis problems is conducted sequentially with
updating local yield strength in addition to the configuration of the deforming structures. In
each step and therefore the whole deforming process, rigorous upper bound or lower bound
solutions are acquired sequentially to bound the real limit solutions.
It is noted that a combined smoothing and successive approximation (CSSA) algorithm
presented by Yang (1982) has been utilized successfully with satisfactory results at a modest
cost in certain problems of limit analysis by Huh and Yang (1991) and sequential limit
analysis by Huh and Lee (1993), Huh et al. (1999), Hwan (1997), Kim and Huh (2006), Leu
(2003, 2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b), Leu and Chen (2006) and Yang (1993). Particularly, some
quantitative comparisons with elasto-plastic analysis have been made recently by Huh and his
coworker (Kim and Huh, 2006) showing that only a fraction of the cost of elasto-plastic
analysis was spent by sequential limit analysis based on the CSSA algorithm.
Recently, the author and his co-worker have extended the CSSA algorithm to sequential
limit analysis of viscoplasticity problems by Leu (2003), or/and involving materials with
nonlinear isotropic hardening by Leu (2005, 2007, 2008a, 2008b), Leu and Chen (2006).
3sequential limit analysis, the quasi-static problem is to seek the maximum allowable driving
load sequentially under constraints of static and constitutive admissibility such that
maximize q
subject to 0 in D (1)
tqn
 on Ds
Y  in D
where nindicates the unit outward normal vector of the boundary and the traction vector t

is scalable distribution of the driving load on Ds with the load factor q ;  means the
von Mises primal norm on stress tensor  and Y is a material constant denoting the yield
strength. Therefore, this constrained problem is to sequentially maximize the load factor q
representing the magnitude of the driving load for each step.
The primal problem (1) is the lower bound formulation seeking the maximum solution
under constraints of static and constitutive admissibility. The statically admissible solutions
satisfy the equilibrium equation and the static boundary condition. And the constitutive
admissibility is stated by the yield criterion in an inequality form. We can interpret the
solutions as sets as shown in the work of Huh and Yang (1991), Yang (1993). First, the
equilibrium equation is linear and the constitutive inequality is convex and bounded.
Accordingly, the intersection of statically-admissible set and constitutively-admissible set is
convex and bounded. Moreover, the existence of a unique maximum to the convex
programming problem is confirmed.
2.2 Upper Bound Formulation
Now we intend to transform the lower bound formulation to the upper bound formulation
as similar to the previous work of Huh and Yang (1991). Equilibrium equations can be
restated weakly in the form as
  0 dAuD  (2)
where u is a kinematically admissible velocity field. Integrating by parts, using the
divergence theorem and imposing static boundary conditions, we may rewrite Eq. (2) to give
an expression for q as
 sD dStqu
 =  sD dStuq

= D dA : (3)
where is the strain rate tensor.
5Therefore, the upper bound formulation seeks sequentially the least upper bound for each
step on kinematically admissible solutions. Accordingly, the primal–dual problems (1) and (8)
are convex programming problems following the work of Huh and Yang (1991) and Yang
(1993) and as shown by Yang (1981, 1987, 1991a). Thus, there exist a unique maximum and
minimum to problems (1) and (8), respectively.
Thus, the extreme values of the lower bound functional q and its corresponding
upper bound functional uq  are equal to the unique, exact solution q for each step in a
process. Namely
maximize q q =minimize uq  (9)
3. Computations
Traditionally, the assumption of a suitable failure mechanism (Chen, 1975) is critical to
reduce the duality gap between the lower bound and the upper bound. However,
finite-element limit analysis can be applied effectively to more complex problems by the use
of finite element methods (Reddy, 1993) together with mathematical programming techniques
(Luenberger, 1984).
3.1 Discretized functional
The upper bound formulation turns out to a constrained quadratic programming problem.
The constrained minimization problem (8) is then stated approximately in the finite-element
discretized form such that
minimize  Uq~ 

element stiffness matrix; U is the nodal-point velocity vector and superscript t denotes
transposition; C and T are coefficient matrices
3.2 Numerical algorithm
The CSSA algorithm presented by Yang (1982) is now utilized to deal with the nonlinear
Problem (10) sequentially. Accordingly, the functional at the current step n is reorganized in
the following form

where 1K is the inverse of K .
As expressed in Eqs. (17)~(18), the current value of 1j is based on the value of
jU }{
 acquired at the preceding iteration j . With the obtained 1j , the other unknown
1}{ jU is then calculated as described in Eq. (19). Initially, an arbitrary 0}{U is assumed as
the first estimate. A convergent sequence of )}({ jU
 is then generated iteratively and
converges to the plastic limit load. Computationally, an inner and outer iterative sequence is
conducted to solve the minimization problem. From one outer iteration to the next, the
smoothing parameter  used in the inner iteration is allowed to decrease and then
convergence to zero finally. Stopping criterion based on the ratio of Euclidean norms

work by Leu and Chen (2006).
4. Analytical solutions
For rigorous comparisons, we derive the analytical solutions corresponding to
thick-walled hollow cylinders of strain-hardening viscoplastic materials subjected to internal
pressure in plane-strain conditions. In addition to the plastic limit load, it is also interesting to
reveal the interaction between strengthening and weakening behavior during the deformation
process. Therefore, the onset of instability and the stability condition are also derived

Finally, we come to consider the condition of stability, namely the existence of a
hardening phenomenon before the weakening behavior. Mathematically, it is to consider the
increase of the plastic limit load during the widening process expressed in the form

Certainly, the condition expressed by Inequality (44) is equivalent to see if there exists the

Certainly, the larger the value of 0/ the more obvious the strengthening range.
Therefore, the critical case of 0aa and 0bb is corresponding to the minimum value of
0/ . Thus, corresponding to the viscoplastic strain-hardening behavior with the hardening
exponent 3h , we can substitute the values of 0aa and 0bb into Inequality (46)
and get the existence of the stability condition as

5. Comparisons and validations
We consider thick-walled cylinders made of strain-hardening viscoplastic materials
subjected to internal pressure in plane-strain conditions. Comparisons between numerical
results and analytical solutions are made to demonstrate the reliable applications of the
computational optimization procedure presented in the paper.
The initial inner and outer radii of the hollow cylinder are denoted as 0a and 0b
respectively. The innermost edge is subjected to the action of uniform pressure simulated by
using the stress control. The pressure needed to keep the expanding cylinder fully plastic is
then computed sequentially by using the CSSA algorithm. In the following case studies, we
adopt the dimensional consistently parameters: 0.50 a , 0.100 b , 3h , 0.10  , and a
constant step size 01.0t .
As shown in Fig. 1, only one quarter of the axisymmetric structure is simulated the
13
limit load maximum while dealing with thick-walled cylinders (Rimrott, 1960; Chakrabarty,
1987). Namely, the strengthening due to material hardening is exceeded by the weakening
resulting from viscoplasticity and the widening deformation.
6. Conclusions
Based on the concept of sequential limit analysis, the paper has analytically and
numerically investigated thick-walled hollow cylinders under internal pressure made of
strain-hardening viscoplastic materials simulated by the von Mises model.
By sequential limit analysis, the pressurized problem was formulated as a sequence of
limit analysis problems and solved iteratively by a combined smoothing and successively
approximation (CSSA) algorithm (Yang, 1982). The CSSA algorithm adopted is comparable
for its simple implementation and unconditional convergence. Upper-bound plastic limit loads
were then acquired iteratively through a computational optimization procedure.
The interesting interaction between strengthening and weakening behavior during the
deformation was revealed numerically and analytically. The strengthening behavior is due to
the strain hardening property and weakening behavior is corresponding to the strain-rate
sensitivity and widening deformation. Numerical and analytical efforts were also made to
capture the onset of instability and to determine the stability condition.
The related stability condition was obtained explicitly while the implicit form of the
onset of instability was solved by the fixed point iteration (Ciarlet, 1989). Considering the
viscoplastic strain-hardening behavior with the hardening exponent 3h and assuming
the stress control approach, the stability condition for the pressurized thick-walled hollow
cylinders is obtained analytically as 2/ 0  m . Namely, it is found that the
strengthening phenomena exist only for the cases that the relationship 2/ 0  m is
held between the strain-rate sensitivity m and the yield strength ratio 0/ .
With the numerical and analytical investigation of the plastic limit load, the onset of
instability and the stability condition, the computational optimization procedure presented in
the paper has been illustrated as a reliable tool for structural design and safety assessment.

where ais the velocity of the innermost edge. In addition, it is interesting to reveal the interaction
between strengthening and weakening behavior during the deformation process. Therefore, we come
to consider the condition of stability, namely the existence of a hardening phenomenon before the
weakening behavior. Mathematically, it is expressed as 0/)/( 0  aPi  . If we apply the velocity
control to simulate the action of internal pressure, we get the stability condition as

二、與會心得
首先，必須感謝國科會專題研究計畫的經費補助，得以參與此一國際固體力學研討
會，雖然路途遙遠，花在搭機及轉機的時間相當久，補助款亦不敷各項支出，但仍深感
不虛此行。
整體上，這是一個辦得相當出色的國際研討會，由於地緣關係，以歐洲各國研究者
出席最具踴躍，亞洲國家則以日本約 5 位代表出席最多。另值得一提，會場各分組議程
主席，主要以波蘭當地研究者為主，不過日本代表中卻有二位受邀擔任分組議程主席，
可見兩國交流之密切。
本次會議地點在格旦斯克之古鎮(old town)旁的 Dom Muzyka旅館舉行，該旅館旁有
一音樂學校，會議住宿有一部份是原提供給音樂學校學生的宿舍。四個會議廳僅主會場
Room A較具規模，其它均為簡單的鋼琴教學演奏室之類的陽春會議廳，但因四個會議廳
均在同一建築物內，相距甚近，方便與會者換場挑選論文聆聽，同時 coffee break時方便
與會者聚集交談。
本文作者參加 elastic-plastic continuum & other field theories議題，安排於會議第一天
第一個議程的時段，並於主會議廳 Room A發表論文(15分鐘發表、5分鐘討論)，而主持
人之一為鼎鼎大名的 Prof. P. Perzyna，雖已高齡 76，但仍全程參與整個研討會的論文發
表與活動；筆者論文發表時，有二位提出問題討論，其中一位即為 MIT 的 L. Anand 教
授。筆者特地於週四下午參加大會安排的古鎮巡禮時，向二位研究先進寒暄致意，並感
受到他們提攜後進的溫馨關懷。
另外，來自立陶宛(Lithuania)材料強度系(department of strength of materials)的系主任
R. Kacianauskas教授，受邀在 general lecture時段發表「The Discrete Element Method with
Applications to Simulations of Granular Flow and Dynamic Fracture of Solids」.筆者特地於
coffee break時，向其請教該研究成果應用於土石流模擬的可能性，獲得 R. Kacianauskas
教授的熱絡回應，並希望筆者能代為轉達其對雙邊合作的高度意願，筆者亦已將其研究
訊息轉達給國內相關學者，期待有進一步雙贏的發展。
總之，這次能親自參加此一國際盛會，藉由各類議題的觀摩與討論，能與各國與會
者廣泛交流，分享研究成果，對個人研究視野提升有極大的幫助。而會中，不乏已白髮
蒼蒼的可敬研究先進，仍積極全程參與整個研討會的論文發表與討論，尤其令人由衷敬
佩。
4ON THE LIMIT INTERNAL PRESSURE OF HOLLOW CYLINDERS OF STRAIN
HARDENING VISCOPLASTIC MATERIALS
S.-Y. Leu
Department of Aviation Mechanical Engineering, China Institute of Technology, Taiwan
1. Introduction
The paper presents the analytical and finite-element efforts of limit loads of thick-walled
hollow circular cylinders. The internally pressurized structures are of strain hardening viscoplastic
materials. It is appropriate to evaluate the limit loads by limit analysis sequentially to illustrate the
interesting interaction between strengthening and weakening behavior reflecting the properties of
strain hardening and strain-rate sensitivity during the deformation process. Particularly, the related
analytical solutions are also derived for rigorous validation of the numerical results.
2. Problem statement and numerical investigation
We consider a plane-strain viscoplastic problem of the von Mises-type material with nonlinear
isotropic hardening. The problem domain D consists of the kinematic boundary Dk . The problem
statement leads naturally to the lower bound formulation. By duality theorems [1], the corresponding
upper bound formulation can be stated in the form of a constrained minimization problem as

where  is the dual norm of the primal norm  based on the flow rule associated with the von
Mises yield criterion. Y is a material constant denoting the yield strength. G is a constant relating to
the velocity control in each step but may be of various values in a process. 0 u is the
incompressibility constraint inherent in the von Mises model. On the other hand, the behavior of
viscoplastic, nonlinear isotropic hardening is described in the form as

where 0 is the initial yield strength,  is the saturation value of 0 and h is the hardening
exponent. is the equivalent strain and is the equivalent strain rate. 0and m are the reference
strain rate and strain-rate sensitivity, respectively. We conduct a sequence of limit analysis problems
with updating the configuration of the deforming structures and the current yield strength. In each
step and therefore the whole deforming process, rigorous upper bound solutions are solved iteratively
by a combined smoothing and successively approximation (CSSA) algorithm [2].
3. Analytical investigation
For rigorous comparisons, we also derive the corresponding analytical solutions with the
hardening exponent 3h . The initial interior and exterior radii of the cylinder are denoted by 0a
and 0b . Also, its current interior and exterior radii are denoted by a and b .With the boundary
conditions ir Par  )( , 0)( brr , we have the limit load expressed as [3]
