二、緣由與目的： 
對於一作為開關的金氧半元件而言，最重要
的特性指標在於電性上給定其開關之分界，也就
是臨界電壓之概念；由於互補式金氧半(CMOS)
電子電路操作上一般由閘極電壓控制其電流大
小，傳統上臨界電壓之定義便是以閘極電壓之大
小來決定電流之開關標記。臨界電壓，一直是金
氧半電晶體最具指標性的元件參數，同樣的也有
許多物理上與量測上對於此參數之分析。從物理
角度來看，傳統上最經典的 2ψB 模型所呈現出之
意義，在於反轉電荷的數量成長至與通道摻雜相
當時，此時閘極的偏壓所帶來的反轉電荷量大到
使足夠電流產生，因此定義此時的閘極偏壓為臨
界電壓[1, 2]。不過在實際量測上，由於我們並不
能知道反轉電荷的真實數量，而通道摻雜一般來
說也不會如此均勻，因此較為常用的方法多半是
透過電流與電壓量測關係圖的結果決定臨界電壓
其值。 
然而，實際上不論是最單純概念之均勻通道
摻雜單閘極金氧半電晶體或者是非均勻通道摻雜
之單閘極金氧半電晶體，甚至各種非平面架構之
金氧半電晶體，如 SOI、雙閘極、三閘極、環繞
式閘極之金氧半電晶體，乃至到使用高介電係數
絕緣層或高移動率鍺通道的金氧半電晶體，傳統
2ψB 模型並不適用。圖一為以上所述之各種金氧
半電晶體元件之示意圖。 
首先考慮單閘極電晶體，臨界電壓隨著製程
演進而不斷縮小，但為了控制短通道效應，反向
摻雜造成的低表面摻雜卻使得 2ψB 模型無法應
用，只能選擇較濃摻雜處作為 2ψB之指標[1]；而
對於 SOI、雙閘極或多閘極金氧半電晶體而言，
為了降低摻雜漂移所造成臨界電壓變動的問題，
低摻雜或無摻雜通道的使用[3] ，亦使得 2ψB模型
的使用有極大困難。圖二則為比較量測上與 2ψB
模型之臨界電壓，圖(a)為單閘極金氧半電晶體之
電流電壓關係圖，圖(b)則為對稱型雙閘極金氧半
電晶體之電流電壓關係圖，可明顯看出隨著摻雜
愈低，傳統模型與實際的電流行為漸行漸遠，無
法忠實的呈現電流轉變的特性。因此，無論是任
何型態之元件，隨著摻雜濃度的降低，此模型與
量測上之誤差愈大。也代表著 2ψB 定義下之電荷
量愈不足實際上所需。而這樣的差距其實可看出
並非存在一種定量之解析修正即可，而必須找出
傳統 2ψB 理論其無法使用於各種金氧半電晶體元
件之原因。 
探討誤差之來源，必須先由電晶體元件開關
之定義著手。開與關的定義，應來自於電流的大
小，然而決定開或關時的電流大小，並不容易界
定，因此臨界電壓在電流電壓量測的呈現方式，
目前以最大轉導法(Max transconductance method)
及定電流法(constant current method)最為常見：最
大轉導法是找出電流電壓量測中於最大轉導處外
插求取臨界電壓 [1]；而定電流量測則是選取一適
當電流並定義此時閘極電壓為臨界電壓 [4]。比較
在物理上最常見的 2ψB 定義來說，量測上的結果
一般皆略大於此物理定義。也因此，許多改良式
臨界電壓模型因此而生 [5-12]。但隨著元件尺寸
不斷微縮，為了維持閘極控制能力及調整臨界電
壓，不斷提升的通道摻雜量卻受制於摻雜漂移
(dopant fluctuation [13])的因素而必須改以低摻雜
且改藉由調整閘極功函數的方式控制臨界電壓
值。在這樣設計的情況下，低摻雜之通道，由 2ψB
的定義會導致反轉電荷量的不足而導致與量測上
出現極大的不一致 [4]。此外，為了控制短通道效
應(short channel effect)所必須提昇的閘極控制
力，使得 2ψB 定義中摻雜對臨界電壓值造成的影
響被高估，也是導致傳統物理定義與實際量測產
生誤差的原因。 
三、研究方法： 
本計畫之執行目的乃發展一種以漂移電流為
指標之新臨界電壓理論，並以漂移電流之概念，
推導各型態元件之臨界電壓模型並比較模擬分
析，驗證此臨界電壓之適用性，亦提供量測上更
具有物理意義的根據。比較以往臨界電壓之定
義，我們可發現多半是以反轉電荷之多寡決定，
雖然一般較具物理意義，在應用上卻欠缺適應
性；而由電流電壓關係所求得之臨界電壓模型，
在物理意義上卻往往較為薄弱。因此，衡量臨界
電壓在觀察上所代表的意義，分析電流之行為，

Threshold Voltage of Ultrathin
Gate-Insulator MOSFETs
Chun-Hsing Shih and Jhong-Sheng Wang
Abstract—This letter elucidates the difficulties in applying the
conventional 2ψB threshold voltage model for current MOSFETs
with ultrathin gate insulator and presents a new comprehensive
alternative for general MOSFETs. After high-k gate dielectric
is successfully developed to acquire a strong gate control, the
on–off switching of MOSFETs is no longer dependent on substrate
doping concentration as before. A physical drift-current threshold
voltage model is proposed directly from the drain current itself,
where the threshold voltage is defined as the onset of the drift
current playing the main contribution in the total drain current.
It can properly predict threshold voltage for general MOSFET
devices and appropriately provide a physical current criterion for
extracting the threshold voltage.
Index Terms—Diffusion current, drift current, MOSFET,
threshold voltage, ultrathin gate insulator.
I. INTRODUCTION
THRESHOLD voltage is the key parameter to describethe on–off switching characteristics of MOSFET devices.
Conventionally, threshold voltage is defined as the gate voltage
when the band bending of silicon surface reaches 2ψB , where
ψB is the difference between the Fermi and the intrinsic levels
[1], [2]. It has been pointed out that the significant deviations
of threshold voltages are observed by comparing them with
extracted, measured, or simulated results [3]–[6]. A fitting
correction term is required to modify the classical 2ψB models.
The use of retrograde profile beyond the submicrometer regime
makes the 2ψB model ambiguous as to whether 2ψB is defined
by a low or high doped region [1]. The difficulties in applying
the 2ψB models are aggravated [3] when the intrinsic or lightly
doped channel is requested to enhance channel mobility [7] and
minimize dopant fluctuation [8] for nanoscale MOSFETs. Fur-
thermore, as the high-k gate dielectric is successfully adopted
to have a sufficient gate control in 45-nm technology [9], [10],
the on–off transition of MOSFETs will no longer depend on the
substrate doping concentration as before. The threshold voltage
of undoped MOSFETs is thus arbitrarily defined as the gate
voltage when the band bending of silicon surface reaches a half-

bandgap [11], [12]. A plausible concept of threshold voltage is
alternatively proposed to define the threshold voltage at which
the minimum density of inversion carriers reaches an adequate
value while the quantity of inversion charges are not physically
determined [13], [14].
The charge-based threshold voltage models [1]–[6],
[11]–[14] offer a useful approach to identify the turn-on
behavior of MOSFET devices; however, these cannot precisely
represent the sufficient ON-state drain currents that really
matter in real device and circuit operations. In this letter,
the difficulties in applying the conventional 2ψB model are
first presented for current MOSFETs. Instead of the indirect
threshold voltage definition by the relative inversion charges,
a physical drift-current threshold voltage model is proposed
to describe the switching characteristics of MOSFETs directly
from the drain current itself. Results of the threshold voltage
and the associated onset current are examined using analytical
derivations and 2-D simulations [15]. The onset threshold
current can serve as an indicator to provide a physical criterion
for extracting the threshold voltage [16].
II. DIFFICULTIES IN ULTRATHIN
GATE-INSULATOR MOSFETS
For MOSFET devices, the gate-voltage equation is given
by [1]
Vg = Vfb + ψs + Vox (1)
where Vg is the applied gate bias, Vfb is the flatband voltage,
Vox is the voltage drop across the gate insulator, and ψs is the
surface potential. In the conventional 2ψB model, the threshold
voltage (Vth) is described as [1]
Vth = Vfb + 2ψB +
√
4εsiqNaψB
Cox
(2)
where ψB = kT/q · ln(Na/ni), Cox is the gate-insulator ca-
pacitance, and Na is the substrate doping concentration. Here,
the threshold voltage indicates the required gate voltage when
the inversion charges are equal to the bulk depletion charges.
For heavily doped MOSFETs, the inversion charges can be
sufficiently large to give a suitable current level at the defined
threshold voltage. However, for lightly doped devices, the
inversion charges will easily reach the substrate background
at a considerably small gate voltage. Insufficient current levels
are expected for MOSFETs by this 2ψB model. As a high-k

the surface potentials at the source and drain, respectively. In
subthreshold and inversion regimes, ψs(L) and ψs(0) can be
obtained by solving the 1-D Poisson’s equation and the gate-

warrant the approximation of the threshold voltage expression

capacitance is not explicitly included in the aforementioned
derivations. For a thin gate-oxide device, the inversion layer
capacitance becomes pronounced to determine the drain (drift
and diffusion) current level. The drift-current threshold voltage
model can be conceptually extended to include the depen-
dence of the inversion layer thickness, where the gate-oxide
capacitance Cox can be regarded as an equivalent gate-oxide
capacitance. The threshold voltage is thus determined at a
relatively low current caused by the in-series inversion layer.

Abstract
This paper presents a new, physical threshold voltage model to solve the ambiguity in
determining the threshold voltage of double-gate (DG) MOSFETs. To avoid the difficulties of
the conventional 2ψB model in nearly undoped DG MOSFETs, this study proposes to define
the on–off switching based on the actual roles of the drift and diffusion components in the total
drain current. The drift current strongly enhances beyond the threshold voltage, while the
diffusion current plays a major role in the subthreshold. The threshold voltage is defined as the
drift component that exceeds the diffusion counterpart. From the solutions of Poisson’s
equation, the drift and diffusion currents of DG MOSFETs are separately formulated to derive
the analytical expressions of the threshold voltage and associated threshold current. This
model provides a comprehensive description of the switching behavior of DG MOSFET
devices, and offers a physical onset threshold current to determine the threshold voltage in
practical extraction.

1. Introduction
As the channel length of MOSFETs extends into the deep
sub-50 nanometer regime, the gate of bulk devices gradually
loses the channel control of CMOS devices. The undoped
double-gate (DG) MOSFET becomes one of the most
promising candidates to scale CMOS devices into the next
generations. This is because DG MOSFETs exhibit better
on–off switching, smaller short-channel effect, less mobility
degradation and free of dopant fluctuation compared to the
traditional bulk MOSFETs [1, 2]. However, the physical
modeling of DG MOSFETs suffers from severe challenges
never seen before due to the use of a fully depleted DG
structure and nearly undoped silicon body. Determining
the physical threshold voltage remains problematic even
though the potential distributions can be solved by the one-
dimensional (1D) Poisson’s equation [3, 4]. The appropriate
3 Author to whom any correspondence should be addressed.
onset currents required to assure the current criteria of the
threshold voltage in practical parameter extraction are also
unclear [5–7].
The threshold voltage is the most important parameter
to describe the on–off switching characteristics of MOSFET
devices. The threshold voltage is conventionally defined as
the gate voltage when the band bending of the silicon surface
reaches 2ψB , where ψB is the difference between Fermi
and intrinsic levels [8, 9]. Unfortunately, the fully depleted
structure of DG MOSFETs makes the 2ψB model ambiguous
in choosing the required bending of surface potential. Since the
fully depleted DG structure has different potential distributions
and associated inversion charges than the traditional bulk
MOSFETs, the recalculations of carriers in the silicon body
are performed to modify the 2ψB model in DG MOSFETs
[10–12]. However, the modified 2ψB models for DG
MOSFETs still fail to attain a meaningful determination of the
threshold voltage due to the nearly undoped silicon body. The

model, threshold voltage must be defined directly from the
drain current itself that really matter in real device and
circuit operations. Taking physical current mechanisms into
considerations, this study proposes that the threshold voltage
is defined as the gate voltage when the drift component of the
total drain current exceeds the diffusion counterpart. That is,
Vg = Vth as Idrift = Idiff, (1)
where Vth is the threshold voltage of MOSFET devices. The
primary difference between the traditional 2ψB model and this
drift-current model is the use of ‘charge’ or ‘current’ to define
the threshold voltage. Under the ‘drift-current’ threshold
voltage model, the threshold voltage represents the onset of
the drift current, which plays a main contribution in the total
drain current. The subthreshold condition of MOSFET devices
indicates that the drain current comes mostly from diffusion
behavior.
Figure 2 illustrates the determinations of the threshold
voltage from the diffusion-to-drift current ratio for DG
MOSFETs. The analytical results of this study demonstrate
the positions to determine the threshold voltage from the
drain current. Since the diffusion and drift currents exhibit
the different roles in the subthreshold and beyond the
threshold voltage, the diffusion-to-drift current ratio is an
excellent indicator to define the threshold voltage with physical
fundamentals. The appropriate drain currents and threshold
voltage levels can be acquired using various device parameters.
To construct analytical expressions of the new model for DG
MOSFETs, a complete set of drain-current equations must
first be derived. Section 3 analytically formulates the drift
and diffusion current components from the potential solutions
of the 1D Poisson’s equation, and examines their roles in the
subthreshold and beyond the threshold voltage.

4. Threshold voltage and threshold current
4.1. Threshold voltage
For the symmetric, undoped DG MOSFET shown in
figure 3(a), the threshold voltage can be described by the drift
and diffusion currents in (12) and (13) as
Vth = Vfb + ψs(L) + ψs(0)2 +
kT
q
. (15)
Instead of depending on the potential drop across the gate
oxide, the drift-current threshold voltage of the undoped DG
MOSFETs is directly attributed to the average of the surface
potentials near the source and the drain. Since the drain current
becomes saturated when the device operates in the saturation
region, DG MOSFETs only require a linear region expression
of the threshold voltage. The gate voltage equation at threshold
voltage is given as
Vg = Vth = Vfb + ψs(0) + 12Vds +
kT
q
. (16)
Together with (16), the surface potential ψs(0) in (A.10) can
be rewritten as

The threshold voltage depends mostly on the flat band and
drain voltages because of the presence of the thermal voltage
and the logarithm function in the last three terms.

with those extracted from other approaches [3, 4, 15, 20].
This figure shows that [15] offers a low threshold voltage
with a smaller current level, while [3, 4, 20] give relatively
high values of threshold voltage. Notably, no previous studies
can properly predict the dependence of threshold voltage and
associated drain current on the drain voltages. The same
threshold voltage is extracted with various drain voltages.
However, the ‘drift-current’ threshold voltage model properly
reflects the dependence of device parameters and applied drain
voltage on the current conduction for DG MOSFETs. An
appropriate threshold voltage value can be obtained as the
drain voltage increases. The following subsection discusses
the dependences of the corresponding threshold current on
device parameters.
4.2. Threshold current
The analytical expression of threshold current at threshold
voltage can be derived from the drift current in (A.2). From
(16), the drift current can be written as
Idrift = 2μkT
q
W
L
· Cox · Vds . (19)
Since the threshold voltage is defined as the drift current being
equal to the diffusion component, the associated threshold
current of undoped DG MOSFETs can be given as
Ith = 4μkT
q
W
L
· Cox · Vds . (20)
From (18) and (20), the threshold voltage and threshold
current linearly depend on the drain voltage for undoped DG
MOSFETs operating in the linear region. Similar to the drain
current, the threshold current is proportional to the relevant
device parameters, such as the gate-oxide capacitance and the
channel width. Since the threshold current represents the onset
of the current enlargement from the enhanced drift current
component, it is independent of the variations of the silicon-
body thickness. Figure 7 illustrates the determinations of
threshold currents for DG MOSFETs in simulated current–
voltage curves. Both the threshold current and threshold

· [Vg − Vfb − ψs(0)]2 + 1
}
. (A.10)
Since the variations of ψs(0) are rather weakly dependent
on the value in the natural logarithm function, the surface
potential near the source can be analytically expressed as (A.5)
by mathematically approximating ψs(0) in the last natural
logarithm term using (A.8).
A.2. In subthreshold region
In the subthreshold region, there are only a few mobile charges
within the silicon body. The potential distributions of the
silicon body mainly depend on the vertical gates. Under this
condition, the potential difference between the surface and the
center of the silicon body is considerably smaller. Further, the
potential ψ0 is almost equal to the difference between the gate
voltage and the flat-band voltage. That is,
Vg − Vfb ∼= ψ0. (A.11)
By applying Taylor’s expansion on the right-hand side of the
boundary conditions in (5) and (6), the boundary conditions
can be rewritten as
ψs − ψ0 = qni2εSi
(
tSi
2
)2
· eq(ψ0−V )/kT , (A.12)
Cox · (Vg − Vfb − ψs) = qni
(
tSi
2
)
· eq(ψ0−V )/kT . (A.13)
By taking (A.11) in the above exponent, the potential solutions
can be analytically expressed as
ψs ∼= Vg − Vfb − qnitSi2Cox · e
q(Vg−Vfb−V )/kT , (A.14)
ψ0 ∼= Vg − Vfb − qni2εSi ·
(
tSi
2
)2
· eq(Vg−Vfb−V )/kT
− qnitSi
2Cox
· eq(Vg−Vfb−V )/kT . (A.15)
The surface potentials ψs at the drain and source sides are
obtained as follows:
ψs(L) = Vg − Vfb − qnitSi2Cox · e
q(Vg−Vfb−Vds)/kT , (A.16)
ψs(0) = Vg − Vfb − qnitSi2Cox · e
q(Vg−Vfb)/kT . (A.17)
Thus, the drift and diffusion currents in the subthreshold can
be explicitly expressed as,
Idrift = μW
L
· (qnitSi)
2
4Cox
· e2q(Vg−Vfb)/kT · (1 − e−2qVds/kT ),
(A.18)
Idiff = μW
L
· kT nitSi · eq(Vg−Vfb)/kT (1 − e−qVds/kT ). (A.19)
From (A.19), the drain current is not proportional to the
gate-oxide thickness or gate-oxide capacitance, but is closely
correlated to the silicon-body thickness. This implies that
the thin silicon body of DG MOSFETs will help suppress
the subthreshold current. Using (A.19) and approximating
Id ∼= Idiff , an ideal subthreshold swing (St ) can be expected at
room temperature for DG MOSFETs:

Abstract: The ambipolar conduction is 
numerically studied in recessed channel 
Schottky barrier MOSFET (RC-SBMOS). 
The results show that the recessed chan­
nel structure can alleviate the lateral field 
penetrations coming from drain electrode. 
Thus, it is rather insensitive to the varia­
tions of drain voltages. However, the 
parasitic recessed channel leads to a 
lower on-state driving current. The depth 
of the recessed channel must be well de­
signed to have good current characteris­
tics in RC-SBMOS. Importantly, the re­
cessed channel structure has only a mild 
effect on suppressing the off-state ambi­
polar hole current. 
1 Introduction: Eliminating the limits on 
the implanted dopant junctions [1] makes 
the metallic source/drain Schottky Barrier 
MOSFETs (SBMOS) as one of the most 
attracting candidates for use in future 
CMOS devices [2]. Nevertheless, the 
SBMOS suffers from potential constraints 
on the drain currents because of its 
unique Schottky source/drain barriers [3]. 
The distinguishing ambipolar conduction 
[4] limits the use of traditional SBMOS for 
further CMOS applications. This work ex­
plores the effects of recessed channel 
structure [5, 6] on the ambipolar conduc­
tion in SBMOS devices. To study the de­
pendences of Schottky barriers on the 
device characteristics, 20 simulations are 
performed with thermionic emission and 
WKB-based tunnelling models [7, 8]. 
2 Ambipolar Conduction in RC-SBMOS: 
Fig. 1 schematically depicts the structure 
of recessed channel Schottky barrier 
MOSFET (RC-SBMOS). The energy 
band diagrams shows there are two sin­
gularities along the surface channel both

at negative and positive gate voltages. 
Fig. 2 compares the am bipolar conduc­
tion characteristics of RC-SBMOS and 
SBMOS. Key device parameters used in 
studies are also shown. RC-SBMOS de­
vices have lower on-state electron cur­
rents, and exhibit similar off-state ambipo­
lar hole conduction to their SBMOS coun­
terparts. The degraded on-driving current 
of RC-SBMOS is attributed mainly to a 
parasitic recessed channel structure. Fig. 
3 displays the energy band diagram with 
various drain voltages. It is rather insensi­
tive of RC-SBMOS to the variations of 
drain voltages. It implies that the re­
cessed channel structure can alleviate 
the lateral field penetrations coming from 
drain electrode. 
Fig. 4 presents the energy band dia­
grams of RC-SBMOS and SBMOS at on-, 
off-, and near-threshold conditions. It can 
be found that the recessed channel has 
only a mild effect on the distributions of 
hole Schottky barriers at off-state. Thus, a 
similar am bipolar behaviour is observed 
in RC-SBMOS. Fig. 5 plots the simulated 
drain currents and associated energy 
band diagrams of RC-SBMOS with vari­
ous depths of recessed channel. It shows 
that the electron on-state current depends 
strongly on the recessed depth. The vari­
ations of recessed depths affect signifi­
cantly the distributions of Schottky barri­
ers and channel potentials in RC-SBMOS. 
3 Conclusions: The recessed depths 
must be well designed to have good am­
bipolar conduction behaviours in RC­
SBMOS. Also, it requires new innovative 
approaches to adopt recessed channel 
structure in SBMOS for future CMOS ap­
plications.
