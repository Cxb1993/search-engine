In this study, we have fabricated a label free DNA biosensor by modifying the platinum wire with 
electrochemically synthesized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene) and poly(p-aminobenzoic acid). A designed 
single-strand DNA oligo was immobilized with the carboxyl group of poly(p-aminobenzoic acid) and served 
as the probe, a target DNA was then hybridized with the probe under a proper condition. Differential pulse 
voltammetry was performed to characterize the hybridization efficiency in the presence of daunorubicin 
hydrochloride that was able to be intercalated into the hybridized double-strand DNA and possessed the redox 
activity. Our results revealed a satisfied linear correlation between the peak current of differential pulse 
voltammetry and the concentration of complementary target DNA. On the other hand, the mismatches 
between the target- and probe-DNA caused a significant reduction of electrochemical response, in which was 
correlated with the amount of mismatched base pairs, therefore the current DNA biosensor had potential 
applications not only in DNA quantification but also in mutation detection for clinical diagnostics and 
laboratory applications.

also achieve a higher conductivity that makes it suitable for a durable biosensor fabrication (Kim et al. 2005; 
Kros et al. 2005; Yamato et al. 1995). Meanwhile, PEDOT can be easily synthesized by either a chemical or 
an electrochemical polymerization approach, and its well-defined surface is adapted to immobilize 
biomolecules, such as proteins and oligonucleotides. The p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a kind of 
carboxylated aniline derivatives and can be electrochemically synthesized to form a poly(PABA) film that 
provides carboxyl groups for probe DNA immobilization. 
In this study, a platinum electrode was electrochemically modified by PEDOT and poly(PABA) in 
sequence. A DNA biosensor was constructed by crosslinking the single-stranded DNA probe with a 3′ amino 
terminal to the carboxyl group of poly(PABA) according to Sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide) and 
EDC (ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide) coupling protocol. The DNA biosensor was able to 
hybridize with a complementary single-stranded target DNA under an optimized condition and an 
electroactive chemical such as daunorubicin hydrochloride (DMN) was then intercalated into the duplex DNA. 
Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was performed to characterize the hybridization efficiency which was 
largely depended on the complementarities between the target- and probe-DNA. The linear correlation 
between the electrochemical response and the concentration of target DNA was finally established.  
 
2. Material and methods 
2.1 Chemicals 
Carboxylate-terminated p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), daunorubicin 
hydrochloride (DNM) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, USA). 
1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and Sulfo N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide 
(NHS) were obtained from Pierce (Boston, MA, USA). All other reagents that used for buffers and solutions 
were purchased from various commercial sources and were of analytical grade. 
 
2.2  Electrode modification and preparation 
Before electrochemical modification, a bared Pt wire (0.6 mm in diameter) was polished in a sequential 
order by soaking in 3 M NaOH for 15 minutes, rinsing with distilled water, being transferred into 3 M HCl for 
15 minutes, rinsing again with distilled water, followed by becoming dry under N2 flow. The polished Pt wire 
was modified in a miniature electrochemical cell with a platinum wire as the counter electrode and an Ag 
/AgCl (3M NaCl) electrode as the reference electrode (Ag /AgCl). The Pt wire was first immersed in 0.1 M 
LiClO4 solution containing 0.01 M of EDOT with 0.5 cm in depth. EDOT was electrochemically polymerized 
on the submerged section of Pt wire by cyclic voltammogram technique under 25oC, where the potential was 
swept between 0.0 to 1.0 V with a rate of 10 mV·s-1 for five cycles. The PEDOT/Pt electrode with a total 
working area approximately 0.097 cm2 was further modified with 3 mM of PABA in 0.1M LiClO4 solution by 
amperometric technique at 1.0 V for 4,000 seconds under 25oC. The surface morphologies of the electrodes 
were visualized by an ABT-150S SEM (TOPCON Corp., Tokyo, Japan). In order to evaluate the events of 
electrode preparation, we modified a thin Pt plate with the same procedure as that for the Pt wire, the surface 
morphologies of both Pt plate and Pt wire were confirmed to be similar by SEM, and the compositions and 
structures of modified Pt plates were subjected to PTIR analysis by a DA 8.3 FTIR spectrophotometer 
(Bomem Inc., Québec City, Canada). Meanwhile, its electrochemical property was evaluated by a 
PC-controlled CHI621B electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments, Austin, USA).

potential: 0.05 V, pulse width: 0.06 s, and pulse period: 0.2 s).  
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Characterizations of DNA biosensor 
SEM was employed to reveal the surface morphology of Pt wire during the stepwise electrode fabrication 
as described in the Section 2. Fig. 1A(a) displayed the smooth surface of a polished Pt wire, whereas Fig. 
1A(b) presented that the section of Pt wire was completely covered by the electrochemically synthesized 
PEDOT film with a typical compact and granular landscape. Fig. 1A(c) exhibited the crystal nature of 
poly(PABA), while the background of PEDOT was still able to be visualized. The structure of poly(PABA) 
might implicate the formation of short oligoes of PABA on the PEDOT film due to the low reactivity of PABA 
(Thiemann and Brett 2001). Accordingly, the Pt wire was successfully modified as the working electrode.  
Fig. 1B demonstrated the FTIR spectra of PEDOT (line (a)) and poly(PABA)/PEDOT (line (b)), where 
both lines showed the characteristic spectra of PEDOT, which including bands at 1514, 1415, 1356 cm-1 
(stretching of C=C and C–C in the thiophene ring), 1174 and 1052 cm-1 (stretching of ethylenedioxy group), 
977 and 838 cm-1 (stretching of C–S bond in the thiophene ring), and 920 cm-1 that was probably due to the 
deformation of ethylenedioxy ring (Kvarnstrom et al. 1999; Li and Imae 2004; Selvaganesh et al. 2007). The 
band at 890 cm-1 that was corresponding to the bending mode of C-H bond in EDOT monomer disappeared, 
indicating the formation of PEDOT molecular chains with α–α′ coupling (Selvaganesh et al. 2007; Zhan et al. 
2008). On the other hand, line (b) in Fig. 1B exhibited extra pronounced bands that were assigned to the 
characteristic spectra of poly(PABA), which were situated between 3300~3500 cm-1 (stretching of N-H), 1708 
cm-1 (stretching of C=O), 1637 cm-1 (stretching of C-N), and 1257 cm-1 (stretching of aromatic ester) (Alva et 
al. 1996; Thiemann and Brett 2001).  In comparison with line (a), the major spectra of PEDOT in line (b) 
became faint, however, the bands including 1174 cm-1 (stretching of C-H), 1365 cm-1 (deformation of 
aromatic ring) (Perry et al. 2009), were significantly enhanced after poly(PABA) modification.

In addition, the stepwise modifications were characterized by cyclic voltammetry in a 50 mM PBS 
solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 M potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). Fig. 2A exhibited the significant 
redox responses of PEDOT/Pt (line (a)) and poly(PABA)/PEDOT/Pt (line (b)) to Fe(CN)63-/4- ions in solution,

DNA and DPV current. The peak currents were obtained by subtracting the baseline value at the same 
potential. 
 
3.3 The specificity of DNA biosensor 
In order to evaluate the specificity of the constructed electrode, we performed experiments by comparing 
the signal response of matched and mismatched target DNA against probe DNA. As shown in Fig. 4A, the 
peak current of DPV profile for target DNA reduced successively when one, three, or five mismatched bases 
were introduced between probe and target DNA. The reduction of the peak current in the DPV profile 
indicated mismatched bases interfered with the DNA hybridization under a selected temperature. Although 
three or five continuous mismatched bases are not common in clinical sense, our results did suggest that the 
constructed DNA biosensor was able to distinguish the complementary target DNA from the target DNA with 
mismatches. Meanwhile, the discrepancy between mismatched target and complementary target was further 
emphasized by increasing the hybridization temperature. In practice, a threshold of the peak current with a 
proper hybridization temperature will be established in order to determine whether the target DNA is fully 
complementary with the probe DNA or any mismatches exist.  
In order to further investigate the specificity of the constructed DNA biosensor, we mixed 100 nM of 
complementary target DNA (cTarget) with one mismatch target DNA (mTarget-1) in varied concentrations. As 
shown in Fig. 4B, increasing the concentration of mTarget-1 caused the notable decrease of peak current. 
Therefore, the constructed DNA biosensor had the ability to identify mismatched DNA in a mixture with 
complementary DNA, and had the potential clinical application for mutation detection.

DNA contained (b) one mismatch (mTarget-1); (c) three mismatches (mTarget-3); (d) five mismatches 
(mTarget-5) against the Probe-1 DNA. (a) represented no mismatch between probe and target DNA. 
The sequences of 19-mer oligoes were listed in Table 1 and their concentrations were all 100 nM. (B) 
The influence of mismatched target DNA (mTarget -1) on DPV current in the presence of 100 nM 
complementary target DNA (cTarget), where the concentrations of mTarget-1 were (a) 0; (b) 6.67 nM; 
(c) 20 nM; (d) 22.67 nM. The hybridization temperature was 55oC. 
 
3.4 A proposed protocol for DNA analysis 
Nevertheless, a practical DNA biosensor should be able to quantify a double strand DNA following a 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Therefore, we have proposed a procedure shown in Fig. 5A, whereas the 
double stranded PCR product was denatured and renatured by the heating and cooling procedures, 
respectively. During the renaturation, a designed oligo as the competitor was annealed to one separated strand 
and the other strand was later hybridized with the DNA probe on the electrode. To evaluate the protocol, we 
9 
 
the typical sponge-like structure. Going through the similar fabrication protocol, we did not detect notable 
signal in responding to the applied target DNA for both poly(PABA)/PPy/Pt and poly(PABA)/PANI/Pt, 
suggesting the surface properties and structure of an electrode are critical for making the success of a DNA 
biosensor. 
Meanwhile, we found that the mismatches between the target- and probe-DNA caused a significant 
reduction of electrochemical response, and the reduction was also corresponding to the percentage of 
mismatched DNA (Fig. 4). In addition, we have compared the target DNA with different mismatches against 
the probe DNA and we scored the detected signal in the order of C/G > C/A ≧ C/T ≧ C/C, which is similar 
to the ranking order of the base-base binding affinities (Naiser et al. 2008). Therefore the current DNA 
biosensor can be used not only for DNA quantification but also for mutation analysis. Nevertheless, a 
practical DNA biosensor should be able to quantify a double strand DNA following a polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). Our results have suggested it can be accomplished by the procedure shown in Fig. 5A. During 
the heating and cooling procedure in the presence of a specific competitive oligo, one strand of PCR product 
forms a hybrid with the competitor and the other strand is later hybridized with the probe on the electrode. We 
are currently working on the further improvement of this PCR coupled biosensor for mutation analysis.
