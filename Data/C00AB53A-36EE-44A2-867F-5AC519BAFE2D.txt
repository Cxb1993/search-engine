Shewhart control chart in detecting small process shifts and is considered by some to be simpler to implement 
than the CUSUM (Montgomery, 2001). An economic model of MA control charts were proposed by Chen and 
Yu (2003), Yu and Chen (2005). Another extension of MA economic model using Taguchi loss function was 
provided by Yu (2005).  
The weakness of economic design does not consider statistical properties such as the probability of type I and 
type II errors when selecting the parameters for the control chart. Statistically designed control charts have 
desirable statistical properties, but the operating cost can be high. Saniga (1989) proposed a method to 
economically design control charts that have bounds of the probability on type I and type II errors and the 
average time to signal (ATS). This design can be viewed as the improvement of economic or statistical design, 
since they consider economic factors while achieving desirable statistical properties. This study will extend 
Duncan’s (1971) model from economic to economic- statistical model to provide more protection to both 
producers and consumers. A numerical example is also employed to illustrate the model’s working and to 
demonstrate its utility. 
2 Economic statistical design of control charts 
Statistical design of control charts are those in which the test power and control limit width are preselected. 
These then determine sample size and, if an ATS is specified, sampling frequency. An economic design of 
control charts is based on an economic criterion. An economic statistical design of a control chart can be defined 
as that the economic-loss cost function is minimized subject to a constrained maximum value of probability of 
type I and type II errors, also the maximum value of Average Time to Signal (ATS) when a process shifts. To 
select statistical constraints, control charts are then designed to have small ATS values in signaling when the 
process is out of control (Saniga, 1989, Yang, 1998). Let Y be the set of design parameters and L be expected 
hourly loss cost of an x  control charts economic model. Then, the economic statistical model of the x  
control chart can be formulated as: 
 ( )Yimize Lmin

where uuu ATS  and  ,βα  are the desired bounds on the probability of type I error, type II error and ATS, 
respectively. The solution of this model is an improvement to the economic design because the properties of 
statistics and minimization of loss cost has been considered. A solution without the constraints is the optimum 
economic design of the control charts (Yang, 1998, Yu et al. 2006). 
3 Definition and assumptions 
The features to be studied in this article are as follows (Duncan, 1971): 
(1) The process is either in-control or out-of-control and in-control at the beginning. 
(2) The mth assignable cause will produce a shift in the process mean of σδm  where σ  is the standard 
deviation of X. 
(3) The standard deviation is assumed to remain invariant when process shifts. 
(4) The probability of positive or negative shift will be the same. 
(5) The failure rate of mth assignable cause is the exponential distribution with mλ . 
(6) The distribution of x  is normal.  
(7) Production is continuous during the search and repair. 
(8) The detected probability when assignable cause occurs is greater than 1- uβ . 
(9) The type I error of the control chart is less than a given value uα . 
(10) The ATS will be less then 4. 
At this time, there are an expected cycle time and an expected loss to be formulated in this model construction.

where mM  is a penalty cost due to poor quality when the mth assignable cause occurs, V is the average cost 
per false alarm, mW  is the repairing cost when assignable cause occurs, b and c is the fixed and variable cost 
per taking a sample, testing and plotting that is independent of sample size respectively.   
The goal of the economic-statistical design of x  control charts is to find the design parameters, n, h and k, to 
minimize the loss-cost function in equation (9) under the statistical constrain of the equation (1). Since equation 
(9) is a very complicated function of the decision variables, n, h and k. In this research, the Grid search 
(McWilliams, 1994) technique is used and modified for the calculation. 
6 Numerical example 
In this section, Duncan’s (1971) data were employed in this study to illustrate the use of the proposed model. 
Here the failure mode in the process was supposed to be twelve. The parameter mλ  is the average rate of 
occurrence per unit time of mth assignable cause which, when it occurs, produces a shift in the process mean of 
σδm . Hence, given the occurrence of the assignable cause, the ratio ∑= ) (with /  mm λλλλ  is the conditional 
occurrence probability of mth assignable cause. An mλ  is referred to as the negative exponential prior 
distribution mentioned by Duncan (1971). The sample testing and analyzing time g for each sample is 0.05. 
When an assignable cause occurred, substantial manpower might have been required, and the production rate 
was often decreased until the cause was found and repaired. When a false alarm signal appeared, its cost was 
estimated to be 25=t . The cost of maintaining the control chart and plotting was 1=b  per subgroup; and the 
cost per sampling unit for the analysis was 1.0=c . Another parameters are listed in table 1.

Suppose the statistical constraints in Type I error probability (?) and Type II error probability (?) and average 
Time to Signal (ATS) are 01.0=uα , 10.0=uβ  and 4=uATS .  
To run the optimization program, a comparison between the pure economic design (ED) and economic statistical 
design (ESD) are shown in table 2. Table 2 reveals that the sampling sizes are 3 and 15 for pure economic and 
economic statistical design, respectively, and the loss cost increases about 23.98% ((4.9284 – 3.9751)/ 3.9751) 
from pure economic design to economic statistical design. And the control limit has no significant difference 
because it has reached the requirement in pure economic design. In the economic-statistical design, the type I 
error probability (?) and ATS are all in the desired limits, and the test power (1-?) is improved from 0.6004 to 
0.9034 (50.47%).
