electrolyte, it is certain that properties of both these phases determine the composition 
of SEI. SEI is essentially formed on the surface of the carbonaceous negative active 
material, thus the type of carbon significantly affects the SEI. Winter et al. showed 
that irreversible capacity loss in the first cycle attributed to SEI formation is linearly 
proportional to the BET specific surface area of the carbon [1]. Zheng et al. found that 
the crystallographic structure and particle morphology are as influential as BET 
specific surface area because coke and graphite powders having same BET specific 
surface area exhibited different ICL [2]. In addition, edges and surface imperfections 
like defects, crevices, and active sites act as catalytic sites for solvent reduction. 
Hence, these regions play an important role in solvent reduction kinetics. Dangling 
bonds and high current density on these sites prefer electrolyte reduction. Thus 
concentration and nature of defects, and edge to basal plane ratio [3] are also critical 
factors affecting SEI properties. In general, the SEI on the cross section of the 
electrode and the edges of the graphite particles contain more inorganic components 
like LiF [46] while the SEI on the graphene sheets contain soft organic compounds as 
shown in a schematic sketch of SEI in Fig. 1. [4]  
 Even though the surface is very important for SEI formation, the importance of 
the crystallographic structure of the carbon should not be underestimated. Highly 
ordered carbons are more vulnerable to exfoliation and are thus more sensitive to 
electrolyte composition. Therefore, crystallographic order significantly affects the 
extent of exfoliation and co-intercalation of solvents [5-6].

SEI. The SEI components shown in darker shades of grey are mainly inorganic while 
those shown in lighter shades of grey are organic. [4] 
 
Once the importance of the surface properties of the material was understood, many 
efforts were made to modify the surface morphology and chemical properties of the 
carbons by various methods. Scott et al. [7] performed reduction of their electrodes in 
Experiments 
The electrode materials were obtained from the disassembled commercial batteries 
(EXA Co.) The cathode consisted of 91wt% of LiCoO2, 3wt% KS6 and 6wt% of 
PVDF as binder with an Al current collector. The anode consisted of 93wt% 
MCMB-2528, 3wt% KS4 and 4wt% PVDF as binder with a Cu current collector. The 
separator (Celgard 2320) was PP/PE/PP tri-layer with a thickness of 20μm (PP: 
polypropylene; PE: poly ethylene). The basic electrolyte, designated as the blank in 
this study, was 1.1M lithium hexafluorophoshate (LiPF6) in Propylene carbonate (PC, 
Novolyte tech. Ltd., 99.98%)/ ethylene carbonate (EC, Novolyte tech. Ltd., 99.98%)/ 
diethyl carbonate (DEC ,Novolyte tech. Ltd., 99.98%) in the ratio of 2:3:5 by volume, 
with 2 wt.% vinylene carbonate (VC Novolyte tech. Ltd., 99.98%), which was the 
commercial electrolyte composition adopted from EXA Co. in Taiwan.[15] The 
preparation of electrolyte was conducted in the glove box. The physical properties of 
these 3 solvent are shown in Table 1. Although the dielectric constant of DEC is fairly 
low, the relatively low viscosity can decrease the viscosity of the PC-EC mixed 
solvent and DEC can promote the wettability of the separator.

actual potentials were slightly higher than the above reported ones. The shift of the 
peak was probably caused by variations in activation polarization because the type of 
carbon and the system of electrolyte used in this study were different from the 
literature described above. Although those Mi-based additives are constitutional 
isomers, and consequently the difference in steric hindrance should cast an impact on 
reactivity, affecting the reaction voltage in the CV measurement, yet it turned out that 
there was no variation in the reduction voltage for all samples with different Mi-based 
additives, this implying that the reduction part of the additives occurred at the 
outermost structure, such as the oxygen of the C=O or the carbon double bond, both 
of which are in the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring, so steric hindrance had no 
influence in reactivity for those additives. Hence, the product of those Mi-based 
additives would retain the original configuration after reduction.

AC Impedance analysis 
Electrochemical impedance spectra of 3-electrode full cell (carbon/LiCoO2 with Li 
metal as the reference electrode) were taken at specific voltages during the first 
intercalation of Li+ into carbon at 0.2C current rate. The specific voltages for 
impedance spectra measurement were decided from the CV results (Fig. 3): the 
reduction peaks occurring at 2.3 and 1.85V (both versus Li+/Li) represent the reaction 
of additives and VC, so 2.1 and 1.75V vs. Li+/Li were regarded as the completion of 
additives and VC reaction. As for solvents, their reaction started at 1.35V vs. Li+/Li 
and kept reacting as the voltage decreased; hence, 1.25 and 0.8V vs. Li+/Li were 
chosen to measure EIS for three reasons: (1) part of solvents had already decomposed 
to form the SEI film; (2) due to the fact that the amount of product was different at

migration of solvated Li+ through the micro-pores of SEI. Hence, the ionic 
conductivity of SEI can be measured by impedance to evaluate compactness and 
stability of the SEI film. Generally, high resistance corresponds to a compact and 
stable SEI. In this study, the RSEI of Mi-4 additive was lowest and the one of Mi-2 was 
the highest, so Mi-2 could generate the most compact SEI film. 
 In the previous CV and AC analysis, it is concluded that the product of those 
Mi-based compounds would keep the original configuration after reduction, causing 
the product to have different degree of bulkiness and twist. The product generated 
from Mi-2 would be less bulky and less bending because of little steric hindrance. 
Besides, the structure of Mi-2 product would be more planar compared to those of 
Mi-3 and -4 products, as shown in Fig. 8(a), so the stacking of the Mi-2 product is 
more compact, causing difficulty for Li+ passage, which in turn resulted in the highest 
resistance in impedance spectra. On the contrary, owing to the largest steric hindrance, 
the product derived from Mi-4 tends to be bulky and winding (Fig. 8(b)), so there 
could be lots of space within molecular structure or the stacking structure between the 
Mi-4 products, leading Li+ to pass through the space readily and resulting in a lower 
resistance in impedance spectrum. As for the structure of Mi-3 product, its result 
settling between those of Mi-2 and Mi-4 products is reasonable.

the surface of the SEI film based on the above XPS spectra. The existence of LiCO3 
results from the reaction of metastable semicarbonate to form stable LiCO3 during 
rinsing solvent to get rid of influence of residual electrolyte (sample treatment before 
XPS observation). [26] The reaction is as follows: 
 
 
 
Therefore, the existence of LiCO3 implicitly represents the existence of organic 
species, i.e. semicarbonate. Although the exact chemical composition was not 
obtained from the above preliminary analysis, the tendency of all samples with 
different electrolyte was similar, suggesting that the chemical composition, or 
specifically speaking, the organic composition (not considering LiCO3) was not 
affected by the N-containing maleimide substituent.  
 
Fig. 10 C 1s and O 1s XPS spectra for the SEI film formed on the carbon electrode 
after the formation process. The carbon electrode is de-lithiated condition. 
 
After organic distribution was found similar for all samples, inorganic compound was 
investigated. Typically, the compound relating to F element in the SEI film always 
exists in an inorganic form, and F 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 11) is analyzed. All samples 
show two main peaks: one at 685.6, corresponding to LiF, and the other at 688 eV, 
related to LiPF6 and its derivatives. The detection of the LiPF6 and its derivatives on 
the outermost SEI film is probably attributed to the remaining salt LiPF6 that was not 
washed out completely by DEC before XPS analysis. [28] The existence of LiF is 
attributed to degradation product of LiPF6 (LiPF6 ↔ LiF + PF5). Moreover, PF5, 
Lewis acid and very reactive gas, can further have a reaction with the organic 
composition in the SEI film, forming another more LiF, as shown in Fig. 12. [21, 29] 
Hence, stabilizing PF5 is important to avoid the degradation of the SEI. Because

of the LiF peak without the Mi-1 additive exceeds that with the additive after the 
batteries were cycled.[14] The reason for amide to stabilize PF5 probably is the lone

Fig. 14 The chemical structure of Mi-1 additive used in the other literature.[14]   
 
Because every sample could differ from each other due to individual error, the ability 
to stabilize PF5 should be investigated by the relative intensity of LiF to LiPF6 instead 
of absolute value. From F 1s XPS results, the ratio of LiF to LiPF6 from high to low 
follows the order: Mi-4 > Mi-3 > Mi-2. The difference in the ratio was caused by the 
varied number of amide functional group reacting with PF5. The number of reacting 
amide functional group in Mi-4 was less than that in Mi-2, so Mi-2 can effectively 
inhibit PF5 from reacting and generating LiF. The difference in ability to reduce the 
formation of LiF resulted from the difference in steric hindrance. In the previous 
discussion, the structure of Mi-2 product was deduced to be less bulky and less 
bending due to its little steric hindrance, and the structure of Mi-4 product tended to 
be bulky and winding because of large steric hindrance. For Mi-4, the winding 
structure could block the contact between PF5 and lone-pair electron at N or O atom. 
Despite of much more space inside the structure of Mi-4 product, the size of space 
was not enough for PF5 to interact with lone-pair electron at N or O atom, as shown in 
Fig. 14 and 15.

Fig. 16 The statistics of discharge capacity in the first cycle. The battery was charged 
and discharged at 0.2C rate (0.002A) between 4.2V and 2.75.  
 
In the first cycle, despite the fact that most of SEI film was formed, the condition of 
SEI film did not reach a steady state, so the contribution of Mi-based additives was 
masked by other components (such as VC and PC). Therefore, the performance in the 
first cycle was barely improved and the variation among all batteries owing to the 
position of functional group was not significant. However, when the cycle number 
was extended longer and the SEI gradually achieved a more stable condition, the 
influence of additive became remarkable in 1C/1C cycle performance, as shown in 
Fig. 17 (discharge capacity versus cycle number). The discharge capacity of batteries 
with all Mi-based additives dropped abruptly at initial 10 cycles, and then faded away 
smoothly. The main cause of sudden capacity drop can be attributed to higher 
impedance in the battery with Mi-based additive because the capacity loss had the 
same tendency with the order in the impedance analysis (Mi-2~Mi-3>Mi-4>blank). 
Since SEI in as interphase between carbon and electrolyte, the SEI with more 
blocking property would stick the Li+ in the layer causing the loss of capacity, 
especially for high current rate. Therefore, the cycle performance was is in agreement 
of the impedance results, and the structure of Mi-based additive was predominant in 
the initial cycles. After several cycles, the battery condition reached a steady state. 
The curve with Mi-based additive became smooth but the one without additive (i.e. 
the blank) kept decaying in the following cycle. Two possible causes contributed to 
the phenomena: (1) although the higher impedance had negative influence in capacity 
loss in the initial cycles, it can protect the electrode from solvent co-intercalating [32] 
due to its compactness; (2) PF5 was stabilized by maleimide functional group so it did

Mi-2 product could be less bulky and winding so the stacking of Mi-2 product in the 
SEI film should be more compact; Mi-4 product was in opposite way, containing 
more space for Li+ to pass through the SEI film readily. The difficulty for Li+ 
travelling through SEI showed in the impedance spectra. In the analysis of impedance 
spectra, the resistance of SEI containing Mi-4 additive with large steric hindrance was 
smaller than the one containing Mi-2 additive with little steric hindrance. By 
simulation of equivalent circuit, the RSEI follows this order: Mi-2~Mi-3>Mi-4>blank. 
The above result presented additives with different structure cast an impact on the SEI 
film. As for chemical composition, the XPS demonstrated similar organic distribution 
whether the electrolyte contained maleimide-based additive or not. However, the 
content of a specific inorganic compound, LiF, was decreased due to the existence of 
maleimide-based additive in the electrolyte because the functional group with 
maleimide-based additive can stabilize highly reactive PF5. Finally, in the battery 
performance test, although the additive had no notable variation in the first discharge 
capacity, the structural effect of additive showed remarkable divergence in discharge 
capacity loss in the initial 1C/1C cycle test. As the cycle proceeded, the discharge 
capacity of batteries with maleimide additives reached a steady state and did not 
reduce anymore. On the contrary, the discharge capacity of the battery without 
additive kept declining as the cycle number increased because of lack of stability by 
maleimide-based additive. Besides, only the performance of Mi-4 additive with large 
steric hindrance can excel the one without any additive. This study suggests that the 
structural effect of maleimide-based additive plays an important role in the SEI layer 
and further influences the battery performance, even though the additives have the 
same functional group. Therefore, the choice of additive should not only consider 
specific chemical properties but also the structure.

Numerous researchers used various compounds and spectroscopic techniques have modified and
identified of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) are the chemically decompose products of electrolyte
solvents and salts.
Two years ago, we had published the maleimide (MI) based are examined as new additives for
electrolytes in lithium ion batteries. We had attempted to increase capacity whereby irreversible
phenomena reduced during charge and discharge process and cyclic ability are also strengthen due to
a new SEI chemical structure. In this new publication, we go a step further to display the substituent
positions effects of novel SEI formation of maleimide based additives. In addition, we also found these
new candidate additives with suitable addition into electrolyte will reveal an interesting SEI of
morphology on the MCMB surface and enhance rate ability of battery.

expansion. In addition, the high water content proceeds side reaction to HF with lithium 
salt, suggesting dissolube transition metal from electrode material and current collector 
corrsion. 
This novel investigation and technique concludes that the manufactoring of lithium ion 
battery no longer untilizes highly dry surrounding and eliminates the cost and enhances 
battery performance. The results show that the battery with additive at typical water 
content increases the capacity of 5~10%.

技術/產品應用範圍 電化學元件，鋰電池，染料敏化太陽電池，電容器
技術移轉可行性及
預期效益
鋰電池必須在高乾燥低水含量環境下才能進行製程是目前所習知的技術，因此絕大部分
廠商皆建造乾燥是與乾燥廠房以因應製程，或是利用氣室(Air Chamber)方式進行二次封
裝加工程序，原因在於高含量水會在第一次電化學反應中電解生成氣體，因此電池會先
預留空間使氣體可以流至氣室，然後再將氣室移除進行二次封裝，然而此程序會多出一
段氣室過程，極不便利且製造額外成本。 
另外，在利用添加劑來移除水的部分則在目前所有文獻皆無類似想法與研究成果發表，
此證明本技術具有突破與創新性，急需立即申請成為本校指標性專利與技術移轉至國內
外，提升我國鋰電池研發能見度。 
註：本項研發成果若尚未申請專利，請勿揭露可申請專利之主要內容。
