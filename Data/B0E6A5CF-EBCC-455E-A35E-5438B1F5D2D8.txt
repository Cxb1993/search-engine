Abstract  
The low-energy electronic states and energy gaps of carbon nanocones in an electric field 
are studied using a single--band tight-binding model. The analysis considers five perfect carbon 
nanocones with disclination angles of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240° and 300°, respectively. The 
numerical results reveal that the low-energy electronic states and energy gaps of a carbon 
nanocones are highly sensitive to its geometric shape (i.e. the disclination angle and height), and 
to the direction and magnitude of an electric field.  The electric field causes a strong modulation 
of the state energies and energy gaps of the nanocones, changes their Fermi levels, and induces 
zero-gap transitions. The energy-gap modulation effect becomes particularly pronounced at 
higher strength of the applied electric field, and is strongly related to the geometric structure of 
the nanocone.

1. Introduction 
The properties and potential applications 
of carbon-related nanometer-size materials 
have attracted intensive interest in recent years.  
Of these various materials, carbon nanotubes 
play a particularly crucial role in the field of 
nano-material science and technology.  Since 
the observation of multiwall carbon nanotubes 
by Iijima [1], many carbon nanostructures 
have identified, such as carbon tori [2], carbon 
nanohorns [3], and carbon nanocones [4], etc..  
A graphite sheet can be notionally divided into 
six equivalent wedges by choosing one of its 
hexagon center through each of its corners.  
A nanocone can then be formed by removing 
one or more of these wedges from the graphite 
- 3 - 
 (2) 
However, when the electric field is applied, to 
the on-site energies of the carbon nanocone 
would be changed.  In present analysis, the 
electric field is assumed to be 
 
 
where E is the strength of the electric field and 
in the unit of 0/Å .  Meanwhile, E is the 
angle between the electric field direction and 
the -axis, and  ( ) is the unit vector in 
-axis ( -axis).  After applying the electric 
field, the diagonal elements of the 
Hamiltonian matrix vary from zero to 
 
 (3) 
The electronic state energies of carbon 
nanocones are obtained by diagonalizing the N 
by N Hamiltonian matrix [26-29], and are 
expressed as , where M, from 1 to 
N, represents the discrete state, and  ( ) 
correspond to the unoccupied (occupied) 
states.  Note that an energy gap, Eg, may 
exist between the highest occupied molecular 
orbital (HOMO) state and the lowest 
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) state. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
The present analysis commences 
considering the effects on the low-energy 
electronic states of the carbon nanocones due 
to an electric field whose direction is parallel 
to the symmetry axis of the cone, i.e. 
 and .  Figure 
2(a)2(e) present the -electronic states 
corresponding to the 2pz orbitals of the five 
nanocones.  Note that the value of Fermi 
energy is set to be zero (EF) in the 
computations.  At E , it is observed that 
the lowest electronic states, which are close to 
EF, are symmetric, while the other states are 
non-symmetric.  However, as E increases, 
the electronic states are drastically modulated 
and state crossings take place at EF 
indicating the occurrence of zero-gap 
transitions (ZGTs), i.e. a change in the energy 
gap from a finite value to zero, or vice versa.  
It is revealed that the ZGTs occur more 
frequently at larger E values.  The nanocone 
with the largest disclination angle, , 
has the greatest height between the apex and 
the base, and the magnitude of the on-site 
potential induced by  is also the highest.  
As a result, a more drastic modulation of the 
electronic states take place.  In other words, 
as the strength of the applied electric field or 
the disclination angle increases, the extent of 
the modulation effect also increases.  
Significantly, the HOMOs and LUMOs of the 
carbon nanocones are symmetric to one 
another about EF at larger E values.  Finally, 
Figure 2(f) shows that the Fermi energies of 
these five systems increase almost linearly 
with increasing E (larger E indicates the 
increment of the on-site potential ).  
Overall, the results presented in Figure 2 
demonstrate that the low-energy electronic 
states and Fermi energies of carbon nanocones 
are strongly dependent on the nanocone 
geometry. 
  Sequentially, we want to investigate 
the effect of the electric field on the energy 
gaps of the carbon nanocones.  Figure 3(a) 
shows the influence of  on the energy gaps 
of the five carbon nanocones. The electric 
field strength E is increased from zero to 0.1 
0/Å .  It is shown that, in the absence of the 
electric field, the carbon nanocones with 
60° and 240° are semiconducting, while 
these with °, 180° and 300° are 
metallic.  As E increases to 0.1 0/Å , the 
energy gaps are strongly modulated, and ZGTs 
take place.  It is observed that the ZGTs 
occur more frequently when a nanocone has a 
larger  angle and is emitted at higher strength 
of E; meanwhile, we know that both larger 
value of  and of E would increase the 
strength of the on-site potential.  Figure 3(a) 
confirms that the electric-field-dependent 
energy gap is highly sensitive to the geometric 
structure of a nanocone.  Figure 3(b) 
illustrates the influence of incidence angles E 
of a electric field on the energy gap of the 
carbon nanocone with a disclination angle of 
60°. At E °, two ZGTs occur at E  0.05 
0/Å . However, as the direction of the electric 
field moves away from the -axis, the

Electronic structures of nanotube–graphene hybrid carbon systems are calculated by the tight-binding
model. The Lennard-Jones potential is used to determine the optimal geometry between nanotubes and
a monolayer graphene. The periodic alignment of nanotubes on graphene results in quasi-one-
dimensional physical phenomena. The low-frequency energy dispersions are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by
the interlayer interactions, such as the removal of subband degeneracy, creation of extra band-edge
states, and modulation of energy gaps. The composite systems could be either metals or
semiconductors according to the alignment and geometry of nanotubes.

Carbon-based nanosystems have been the technologically
attractive materials in recent years ascribing to their various
kinds of dimensionality [1–4] and extraordinary physical proper-
ties. Single graphene sheet, a monolayer of carbon atoms packed
into a dense honeycomb crystal structure, could be regarded as an
ideal two-dimensional nanosystem which behaves as the zero-
gap semiconductor. Depending on how a monolayer graphene is
rolled into seamless cylinder, the one-dimensional nanotubes
could be metallic or semiconducting [5,6]. To measure their
electronic and transport properties, nanotubes are, in general,
supported by certain substrates [7,8], and some interfacial
interactions would inevitably occur. Nanotubes could exhibit
the acceptor- or donor-doped behavior due to the charge transfer
from substrate. However, the interlayer couplings are relatively
weak while the graphene sheet is regarded as substrate. In Falvo’s
recent experimental studies, the nanometer-scale motion of
nanotubes on graphene sheets was controllable by the atomic
force microscopy tips. The in-registry position between them can
be determined [9–11]. The conductance measurements were also
achieved to observe how the electrons go through the nanotube–
graphene interface [10]. The control over the tunable electronic
properties suggests the potential application of electronic nano-
devices. Thus, in this work, the electronic structures of the
nanotube–graphene composite systems are investigated.
From the theoretical aspect, many studies focused on how the
band structures of carbon nanotubes are inﬂuenced by the
substrate, such as silicon, indium arsenide, and other III–V
semiconductors [12–17]. The work function difference between
nanotubes and these substrates might make charge carriers
transfer across the interface. Free carriers might accumulate at
the interface to form the shorter and stronger chemical bonds. The
Fermi level (EF), energy dispersions, and charge distributions are
signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the substrates. In the case of nanotubes
deposited onto a graphene sheet, they possess the similar
chemical potential. The main interactions are the weak van der
Waals force [18,19]. Nevertheless, the atomic hoppings between
them would substantially induce the overlap of low energy bands
[20]. The changes in band-edge states, energy gap, and subband
degeneracy would systematically rely on the nanotube geometry
and the nanotubes alignment on graphene.
In this work, we mainly focus on the non-chiral nanotubes
periodically adsorbed on a monolayer graphene. The optimal
interfacial geometry are determined by the Lennard-Jones
potential. The tight-binding model, containing the intralayer and
interlayer atomic hoppings, is utilized for the band structure
calculations. The low energy dispersions, density of states, and
energy gaps are examined in detail for the different nanotube
sizes, interfacial geometry, and periodic alignments. The experi-
mental measurements of scanning tunneling spectroscopies could
be useful in determining the geometric conﬁgurations of these
hybrid systems [17,21–23].
The armchair ðm;mÞ (zigzag ðm;0Þ) nanotubes are periodically
aligned along the zigzag (armchair) direction of graphene sheet.
They possess the commensurate interfacial geometry. A partial
geometry of the armchair system is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The van
der Waals interactions between the two objects are characterized

interlayer couplings bring about four kFstates; free electrons and
holes might exist near the charge neutral point. The electron
effective mass is responsible for the density of states. The spectral
structures of interacting systems are probably the average result
of non-interacting nanotube and graphene. However, the overlap
of energy bands evidently gives rise to several minor asymmetric
divergences (black curves in Fig. 2(e)).
The main characteristics of energy bands are further modu-
lated by the nanotube–graphene interface. For instance, in the
case of (5,5) nanotubes rotated by 153 from the stable in-registry
position, several linear bands further split into parabolic ones, and
thus more divergent peaks appear in the density of states (green
curves in Figs. 2(c) and (e)). The energy spacings closest to EF do
not correspond to the energy gap. Moreover, Figs. 3(a)–(c)
represent the energy dispersions of composite systems with
larger armchair nanotubes. Intriguingly, mainly owing to the
growing interlayer distance, the increasing nanotube size leads to
the weakening subband coupling and the lessening band-edge
states. The two pairs of kF states become closer to each other due
to the diminishing curvature effects in the larger nanotubes. On
the contrary, composite systems with the smaller nanotubes
exhibit the stronger hopping intensity and more obvious
variations in the density of states, as sketched in Fig. 3(d).
As the graphene subbands are folded along the armchair
direction, one of the k-dependent subbands always goes through
the Dirac point which is recognized as the linear bands
intersecting at EF . As to alignment along the zigzag direction,
the existence of linear bands bases on the alignment interval
between nanotubes. To represent the subbands passing through
the Dirac point, the atom number in a graphene unit cell has to be
the multiplier of three (blue curves in Fig. 4(a)); otherwise, only
the parabolic ones exist near EF (green curves in Fig. 4(a)). In
particular, for 512 atoms in the graphene unit cell, energy spacing
between the lowest subbands is about 0.09 eV, which is
comparable to that of the (9,0) zigzag nanotubes (red curves in
Fig. 4(a)).
Figs. 4(b) and (c) illustrate the interacting zigzag hybrid
systems: the (9,0) nanotubes deposited onto graphene sheet with
480 and 512 atoms in a graphene unit cell. The low-energy
subbands of nanotubes effectively couple with those of graphene
since they possess the similar state energies. The interlayer
atomic hoppings lift the band degeneracy, create new band-edge
states, and modulate the energy gap. The new band-edge states
could locate away from the Brillouin zone boundary k¼ 0. The
composite zigzag systems might be either direct gap or indirect
gap semiconductors.
Energy gaps of composite zigzag systems ðm;0ÞNg are
depicted in Fig. 5 for different nanotube sizes. The red circles
represent the non-interacting ðm;0Þ nanotubes with m¼ 3I
(integer I), and these narrow energy gaps come from the
curvature effect. In the presence of interlayer interactions,
the low energy subbands of nanotubes and graphene sheet are
effectively coupled with each other. Their energy gaps (purple and
black curves) are evidently modulated, especially for those with
the smaller nanotubes. However, such modulation becomes
relatively weak while systems are with the larger nanotubes:

The mechanical behavior of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), being ﬁxed at both ends under
uniaxial tensile loading, is investigated via the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with the Tersoff
interatomic potential. It is found that Young’s modulus of the MWNTs is in the range between 0.85 and
1.16 TPa via the curvature method based on strain energy density calculations. Anharmonicity in the
energy curves is observed, and it may be responsible for the time-dependent properties of the
nanotubes. Moreover, the number of atomic layers that is ﬁxed at the boundaries of the MWNTs will
affect the critical strain for jumps in strain energy density vs. strain curves. In addition, the boundary
conditions may affect ‘‘yielding’’ strength in tension. The van der Waals interaction of the double-
walled carbon nanotube (DWNT) is studied to quantify its effects in terms of the chosen potential.

1. Introduction
The discovery of a carbon nanotube (CNT) has sprung
enormous fundamental and applied researches in nanomechanics
since 1991 [1]. A single-walled nanotube (SWNT) is a one-atom
thick sheet of graphite curved up into a round cylinder with
diameter in the order of a nanometer. The high hardness, modulus
and toughness of the CNT attract researchers worldwide to study
its mechanical properties. It is known that the intensity of CNTs is
100 times higher than steels with the same volume, and the
weight of CNTs is only 1/6 to 1/7 of steels [2]. Therefore, the CNTs
are also known as super ﬁbers.
In the literature, many MD simulation results about MWNT
have been reported. For example, Hwang et al. [3] report
the buckling behavior of SWNT, and Lu et al. [4] study the DWNT
with the MD simulation method. Sears and Batra study the
buckling of DWNT with continuum ﬁnite element truss
models and MD simulations with the MM3 interatomic potential
[5,6]. Liew et al. [7] investigate four-walled carbon nanotubes
with the Brenner potential [8]. Hsieh et al. [9] use the MD
simulation to investigate Young’s modulus of CNT under the
different temperatures and radii. Haskins et al. [10] calculate
Young’s modulus of SWNT via MD simulation with the tight-
binding potential. Verma et al. [11] use the same potential as
adopted in the present paper to calculate Young’s modulus of
SWNT.
In this paper, we perform MD simulation to study the behavior
of double- and triple-walled carbon nanotubes under uniaxial
tensile displacement loading, and study their strain energy
density with respect to strain. We use the curvature method,
through the second derivation of the energy curve, to determine
Young’s modulus of the nanotubes under uniaxial loading. Due to
the discrete nature of the nanotubes, Young’s moduli determined
from tension or bending tests may be different. Several nanotubes
are studied here, including the (5,5)@(10,10),and (10,10)@(15,15)
double-walled nanotubes (DWNTs) and (5,5)@(10,10)@(15,15)
triple-walled carbon nanotubes (TWNTs). After calculating the
strain energy density of the CNT with various lengths and
diameters, we perform a correlation study to identify the effects
of length and diameter on Young’s modulus. Further, we discuss
the changes in Young’s modulus in relation to the number of ﬁxed
boundary layers of the nanotubes, and investigate the effects of
the intermolecular force between shells compared with the van
der Waals interactions.
2. MD simulation

carbon nanotubes in our MD simulations are depicted in Fig. 1.

very thin in tube thickness, the method to calculate the volume
was to multiply its surface area and thickness directly,
V0 ¼ 2pR‘0d, where R is the radius of CNT and d the thickness of
CNT, d=3.4 A˚.
Fig. 2 shows the relationships between Young’s modulus and
length for various nanotubes. It can be seen that the range of
Young’s modulus is from 0.85 to 1.16 TPa (1 TPa=1000 GPa).
Furthermore, the results of the DWNT (10,10)@(15,15) and the
TWNT (5,5)@(10,10)@(15,15) are identical. In Lu et al. [19] it is
proposed that the buckling strain of MWNT is dominated by its
outermost shell, and it appears that Young’s modulus of MWNT is
also inﬂuenced by the chiral vector type of the outer-most shell.
Single-walled nanotubes were calculated for comparison
purposes. From previous studies, Young’s modulus of the
nanotubes can be compared as shown in Fig. 3. Peralta-Inga
et al. [20] investigate the CNT with small pipe diameter with
density functional tight binding (DFTB) method, and Young’s
modulus is found in the range 2.2–2.75 TPa. Krishnan et al. [21]
obtained Young’s modulus of CNT 1.25 TPa experimentally. Coze
et al. [22] have calculated CNT with different chiral vectors, and
found that the Young’s moduli are from 1.22 to 1.25 TPa. Cai et al.
[23] utilize tight-binding methods and ﬁnd CNT’s Young’s
modulus to be 0.95 TPa. van Lier et al. [24] adopted ab initio
assumptions, and found Young’s modulus to be 0.75–1.18 TPa for
(5,5) SWNT. Moreover, Robertson et al. [25] obtain CNT’s Young’s
modulus with the Tersoff potential to be 1.06 TPa, similar to the
present results. Our results show variations in Young’s modulus at
a given radius and length due to the anharmonicity of the
calculated energy curves. The consistency in Young’s modulus for
the DWNT and TWNT indicates that the outermost shell may
dominate the overall Young’s modulus of multi-walled nanotubes.
Further veriﬁcations may be required.
Fig. 4 shows the total potential energy required to pull out the
inner tube of the DWNT. The required energies at the two
temperatures are very close to each other. It is reasoned that these
energies can be considered as the weak interaction energy due to
van der Waals between shells of the nanotubes. The Lennard–
Jones (LJ) potential, U=4e [(s/r)12(s/r)6], is commonly used for
describing the van der Waals interactions. Here e=12 meV and
s=3.4 A˚ are the van der Waals parameters for carbon nanotubes
[26]. From the distance between the inner and outer shell for the
DWNT (assumed to be 2.36 A˚, considering the ﬁnite size of a
carbon atom), one can calculate the weak interaction energy due
to the LJ potential to be about 3.41 eV, which is in agreement with
our MD results (the minus sign in the MD results is due to the
choice of the zero potential surface). By this analysis, it is not
claimed that one does not need to directly include the LJ
potentials in the MD simulations, but it is suggested that by the
Tersoff potential alone, some of the weak interaction features can
be captured.
Fig. 5 shows the effects of the number of boundary layers in
the MD calculations. As can be seen, by ﬁxing 1, 2, 3, and 4 layers,
the energy curves and related energy jumps are different. The
energy jumps can be interpreted as atomic buckling due to some
atoms or a cluster of atoms snap through to a different
equilibrium conﬁguration. The detailed differences in the energy
curves can be found in the inset of Fig. 5. The physical rationale of
the effects of boundary layers lies at the connection between

TWNT(5,5)@(10,10)@(15,15) is located at the same point, due to the
same outermost SWNT(15,15). These results indicate that Young’s modulus of
the multi-walled nanotubes is length independent in the studied length
region.

Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), a mesoscopic simulation approach, has been used to investigate the
effect of volume fraction, the different degree of functionalization, and the effect of PE length on the structural
property of the immiscible polyethylene (PE)/carbon nanotube (CNT) in a system. In this work, the interaction
parameter in DPD simulation, related to the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, , is estimated by the
calculation of mixing energy for each pair of components in molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The
immiscibility property of CNT and PE polymer induces the phase separation and exhibits different architectures
at different volume fractions. In order to observe the effects of different degrees of functionalization, we
change the repulsive interaction parameter to simulate the different degrees of functionalization. In order to
observe the effect of volume fraction and different degrees of functionalization, the radius of gyration and
order parameter are used to observe the arrangement of the polymer chains and CNT, respectively. We find
that different degrees of functionalization will affect the final equilibrium structure significantly when the
volume fraction of CNT is lower than 50%. We also find that the microstructure arrangement of PE is dependent
on the equilibrium phase. Finally, for a shorter PE chain system, we only need to decrease the repulsive
interaction parameter slightly in order to distribute the CNT and the PE in the system. In addition, it should
be noted that different interaction parameters do not relate to any real functional group, but only present
different interaction degree in the simulation, which can reflect the different chemical functionalizations.
1. Introduction
Theoretical calculations and experimental measurements on
carbon nanotubes have shown lots of exceptional properties in
recent years. Because of these properties, CNTs have been
proposed for several applications, such as sensors,1,2 their ability
to store gas,3 polymer-nanotube composites,4,5 and as surfac-
tants.6 The polymer-nanotube composites have especially at-
tracted broad attention in the industrial and research communi-
ties.7-10 In order to use CNTs efficiently and satisfy the demand
requirements, the functionalization of CNTs is an essential area
of study. There are two methods to reach functionlization. The
first method is noncovalent functionalization. This method
utilizes different polymers adsorbed on the surface, and it can
ensure that the surface structure of the CNT cannot be destroyed
and can act as a solute in an organic solvent.11,12 The second
method is chemical functionalization. This uses the covalent
bond to link the functional group with the surface atom,
improving the solubility and enhancing the interfacial adhe-
sion.13-15 Therefore, the functionalization of CNTs in order to
control the CNT-polymer composite characteristics is a grow-
ing area of research.16-19 Polyethylene (PE) is a widely used
polymer material in several areas, and it comprises 20% of the
plastic production in the world.20 PE has several good properties,
such as excellent chemical resistance, good impact and drop
resistance properties, and high durability. The structural behavior
of CNT-polymer composites has attracted broad interest in
research communities,21 because they have useful mechanical
properties. Consequently, PE-functionalized CNT composites
should have a more complex structural behavior and display
different structures.
Computer simulations have been used to study polymer
blend,22-26 diblock copolymer,27-29 and triblock copolymer
properties.30 On a different scale, there are series of well
developed simulation techniques such as the molecular dynamics
(MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) methods on an atomistic level,
as well as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), lattice Boltz-
mann methods (LBM), and dynamic mean field theory (MF)
on the mesoscopic scale. Using atomistic simulation tools, we
can analyze the molecular structure and dynamic behavior of
molecules. Because they are limited in the time- and length-
scale in simulation and cannot effectively prevent a configuration
becoming trapped at a local minimum energy, it is difficult to
observe the phase transformation process of a polymer blend
and diblock copolymer system. Therefore, atom-based simula-
tions cannot predict more realistic structures on a mesoscopic
scale. For structural predictions on this scale, mesoscopic
simulations such as DPD, LBM, and MF are effective methods
to reflect the mixture process between two or more polymers.
Because the simulation methods mentioned above are all focused
on a specific scale, it is necessary to use a method to bridge the
gap between atomistic and mesoscopic simulation to compensate
for the insufficiency of the time- and length-scale and gather
sufficient data.

Groot and Warren’s study shows that they can insert the
mixing effect as ∆a into the repulsive interaction parameter aij
for different kind of beads by the Flory-Huggins parameter,
. For the case in which the reduced density F is 3, this
relationship is as follows:
From ref 42, they use the repulsive interaction parameter in
the DPD simulation and obtain the surface tension. However,
this is not accurate because the surface tension of experimental
data is a constant. Therefore, they assume that a range of ∆a
has a linear variation between 15 to 115, with a  value of 0.3
at ∆a ) 15 and a value of 0.2 at ∆a ) 115. After modifying
the ∆a, the surface tension is a constant and is close to the
experimental data.
2.3. Dissipative Particle Dynamics Simulation Method. In
the present research, the DPD simulation method was adopted
to investigate the effect of volume fraction of a PE-CNT
composite on the structural property; moreover, it also compare
the difference between symmetrical arrangement and asym-
metrical arrangement of the triblock copolymer on the micro-
structure. Equations 6 and 7 only describe the condition that
the DPD simulation follows Newton’s equation of motion.
However, in a DPD simulation, all of the beads in the system
are of the same volume regardless of the number of and kinds
of different molecules comprising the bead. This assumption is
required, because the system must conform to the Flory-Huggins
-parameter theory.42 For simplicity, the masses of all particles
in the system are normalized to 1. Equation 8 represents the
fact that the total force consists of four forces. The interaction
force on bead i is given by the sum of a conservative force, FijC,
a dissipative force,, FijD, a random force, FijR, and a spring force,
FijS.41
where conservative force represents a purely repulsive force,
dissipative force represents the friction between DPD beads that
reduces velocity differences between the particles, random force
works to conserve the system temperature, and the spring force
is used to binding the intrapolymer beads. The second and third
forces are responsible for the conservation of total momentum
in the system. All of the forces act within a sphere of cut off
radius rC, which also defines the system’s length scale. The
conservative force with a linear approximation is given by
where rij is the distance between bead i and bead j and aij is the
repulsive interaction parameter, where aij is the repulsive
parameter describing the interaction strength between beads.
When the i material is the same as the j material, the repulsive
interaction parameter is obtained from the compressibility
parameter. In our DPD simulation, the cell volume is 10 × 10
× 10, and the number density of system is 3 (F ) 3). The system
contains 3000 beads. It consists of 250 chains and every chain
consists of 12 beads. The chain length is fixed at 12 beads at
every volume fraction (including 1/1, 1/4, 1/6, 1/14, and 1/20).
We can adjust the bead ratio to reach the different volume
fractions. In order to describe currently the structure of CNT,
the potential of bond extension and angle was performed for
CNT and shown as follows:
where Cb and ka are force constants representing the bond stretch
and bond bending, respectively, and θa, rb, θa0, and rb0 are the
bending angle, the length, the equilibrium angle of the bending
angle and the equilibrium length of the bond. It should be note
that every PE bead is composed of 3 ethylene monomers and
every CNT bead is composed of 2 unit.
3. Result and Discussion
Since there are currently many methods to functionalize CNT
with different functional groups,18,19 the interaction strength
between CNT and polymer materials can effectively be adjusted.
In order to investigate the effect of different interaction strengths
between PE and functionalized CNT on the microstructure by
DPD, different repulsive interaction parameters are adopted to
reflect different interaction strengths between PE and the CNT
which has been functionalized by different functional groups.
Figure 1 shows different repulsive interaction parameters in DPD
simulations and the corresponding mixing energies between PE
and the functionalized CNT for fraction 1/1. The mixing energy
is defined as eq 1. It can be seen that there is a linear relationship

plays a central role in interpreting light scattering and viscosity
measurements. If all beads have the same mass
where ri denotes the coordinate of the particle, rc denotes the
coordinate of center of mass of the polymer chain, and n is the
bead number in a chain. Additionally, it can be represented as
the tensor in different directions as follows:
where rix and riy denote the position vector of the particle i and
rcx and rcy denote the position vector of the center of mass of
polymer chain. The three eigenvalues of G are denoted by Rg12,
(major-axial, which is the largest eigenvalue) Rg22, and Rg32.
The summation of Rg12, Rg22, and Rg32 is 〈Rg2〉, which can be
used to roughly determine the structural arrangement of a chain
in the system.
Figure 3 presents the CNT order parameter profiles against
different repulsive parameters at five different volume fractions.
At a specific volume fraction, different DPD repulsive param-
eters indicate that the CNTs have been modified by different
functional groups and the interaction strength between the
pristine CNTs and PE polymer has therefore been adjusted. In
Figure 3, the largest repulsive parameter for each profile
represents the mixture of pristine CNTs and PE polymer, with
the CNTs ordered by lamellae or cylindrical phase arrangement,
as listed in Table 2. For the case of CNT/PE volume fraction
of 1/1, different functional groups seem to have no effect on
the arrangements of CNTs, because the order parameters are
higher than 0.8 for all repulsive parameters and all equilibrium
structures are in lamellae phases. For the other four volume
fractions, three characteristic repulsive parameter ranges are seen
to correspond to different CNT arrangements when CNT is
functionalized by different groups. The region where the CNT
order parameter is smaller than 0.3 is designated as region I,
and that larger than 0.8 is regarded as region III. The region
with an order parameter value between 0.3 and 0.8 is designated
as region II. For convenience in comparing the results between
different volume fractions, two repulsive parameters, 20.36 and
23, are used to indicate the region boundaries between the three
repulsive parameter regions, designated by dashed lines. In
region I, CNTs are in a disordered arrangement at the 1/4, 1/6,
1/14, and 1/20 volume fractions. Moreover, the CNT order
parameters do not exhibit significant change with the increase
of repulsive parameter, which can be attributed to the repulsive
force between the CNT and PE at these volume fractions that
is too weak to form the cylindrical phase. However, at 1/1
volume fraction, because the most stable arrangement of CNTs
is aligned in parallel along the axial direction, it is easier to
form the lamellae phase.
In Region II, except for the 1/1 volume fraction, the order
parameters of CNT generally increase significantly when the
repulsive parameter increases. Further, from 1/4 to 1/20 (that
is, with a relative decrease of CNT to PE), the point at which
the order parameter shows significant increase (i.e., its slope
rapidly increases), follows an increasing trend. For example,
the point at which this occurs is 20.36, 20.56, 20.66, and 21.66
for the volume fractions of 1/4, 1/6, 1/14, and 1/20, respectively.
We name these values critical-repulsive interaction parameters,
signifying where the repulsive interaction strength is large
enough to allow both the PE chains and the CNTs to congregate
with like material. When the repulsive parameter reaches a value
of 23, the order parameter of CNT maintains a value of 0.95.
At a repulsive parameter value higher than 23, the equilibrium
phase remains in the cylinder phase. Figure 4 shows the
congregating process of the CNT at 1/4 volume fraction. It can
be clearly seen that the CNT remains distributed relatively
evenly throughout the DPD system when the repulsive parameter
is smaller than the critical-repulsive interaction parameter as
shown in Figure 4(a). The CNTs start to congregate when the
repulsive parameter becomes larger than the critical-repulsive
interaction parameter, as shown in Figure 4b-d. Note that the
proportion of CNTs affects the adjustment range of the repulsive
parameter necessary to reach a 0.95 order parameter that forms
the cylinder phase. For example, at a 1/20 volume fraction, the
system has the fewest CNTs, and the repulsive parameter must
be increased from 20.36 to 23 to reach the value of 0.95.
However, at the 1/4 volume fraction, only an increase from
20.36 to 21.56 is required. This suggests that it is difficult to
adjust the CNT order parameter by adjusting the repulsive
parameter when the proportion of CNT is larger than 5% (1/
20), and that the proportion of CNT added to reinforce
composite material should then be lower than 5%. Such an
addition has not only the benefits of improve the material
properties through reinforcement, but also ease in controlling
the structure during the process of reinforcement. This has been
confirmed in several studies.8,45 The reason for this is that the
distance between CNT and CNT is longer at a smaller volume
fraction, and therefore the required repulsive parameter neces-
sary for CNT to congregate is larger. In region III, all of the
CNT order parameters are about 0.95, even at a higher repulsive
parameter.
Figures 5 and 6 show the profiles of 〈Rg2〉and the correspond-
ing projected values of 〈Rg2〉in three major axial directions for
the different repulsive interaction parameters at different volume
fractions. Two dashed lines are again to indicate three different
characteristic repulsive parameter regions. The circle in Figure
5 denotes the 〈Rg2〉 of the pure PE system. The three major-
axials shown in Figure 6b-d has values close to 0.62, indicating
that the microstructure is spherical at Region I. Only the results
for four volume fractions (1/1, 1/4, 1/6, and 1/14) are shown in
Figure 6 because the results of the volume fraction of 1/20 are
very similar to those at 1/14. For repulsive parameters within
Region I, except for the case at 1/1 volume fraction, the values
of 〈Rg2〉 are about 1.86 to 1.88, and the CNTs are in disordered
arrangements, as can be seen the snapshots shown in Figure
3c. Figure 6b-d shosw that the projected values of the three
major-axes are almost the same at Region I, which indicates
that the microstructure of a PE chain tends to be spherical in
that region, the disorder phase. This is why CNTs can move
easily in the environment, as shown as Figure 7a, where the
long gray rectangles represent the CNTs, and the blue spheres
represent the PE chains forming spherical microstructures.
Further confirmation of this comes from the small CNT order
parameter. We also observe that 〈Rg2〉 of PE at 1/20 volume
fraction and 〈Rg2〉 in a pure PE system are almost the same.
At the 1/1 volume fraction, the equilibrium phase is the
lamellae. According to the three profiles in Figure 6a, the
microstructures of the PE chain are disk-like because there are
two longer major-axes and one shorter major-axis. The disk-
like microstructure of the PE chain is preferable in forming the
lamellae phase and contacting with other disk-like PE molecules.

At these volume fractions which have the cylindrical phase, 〈Rg2〉
decreases with the increasing repulsive interaction parameter,
with their respective order increasing from 1/4 to 1/20. The
largest 〈Rg2〉 is at the 1/20 volume fraction; as the volume
fraction becomes larger, the 〈Rg2〉 of PE molecule becomes
smaller. The reason for this is the number of CNTs in the
system. As the number of CNTs increases, the cylinder becomes
larger. The PE molecules which are affected by the repulsive
interaction parameter on the interface increase, and the number
of microstructures which transfer their structure from spherical
to ellipsoid increases as well. From Figure 6b-d, we can
observe that, for each volume fraction, the repulsive interaction
parameters for microstructures which start to transfer are the
same as the critical-repulsive interaction parameters. Moreover,
the near-constant values of the repulsive interaction parameter
of the three major-axials in region II are the same as repulsive
interaction parameter for an order parameter of CNT of 0.95 at
each volume fraction (from Figure 3). This indicates that the
change of microstructure will be affected by the CNT arrange-
ment. When the CNT change their arrangement, the micro-
structures of PE molecules also change. That is why the PE
molecules at 1/4 volume fraction changes microstructure during
