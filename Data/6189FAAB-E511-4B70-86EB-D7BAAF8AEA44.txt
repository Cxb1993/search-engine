the proposed method, the MOS transistor and its 
corresponding de-embedding standards were fabricated 
using a standard CMOS technology and characterized up 
to 40 GHz with a two-port S-parameter measurement 
system. 
2. Theory of Proposed Scalable Microwave 
De-Embedding Scheme 
2.1 On-Wafer Fixturing 
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the on-wafer test fixture is designed 
to mount the device with the probe pads, interconnects, 
and ground reference. Both DC and AC sources can be 
guided to the DUT through bias-T networks, cables, and 
probes. In general, the gate and drain of the MOS 
transistor are connected to input and output ports while the 
source and bulk are tied together to ground. Here we 
introduce the shielding technique to prevent the bulk 
leakage and port-to-port coupling [10]. It should be noted 
that the interconnects do not employ shielding layer for 
more general discussion. The shielded open and short 
standards can be used to accurately simulate the parasitics 
of the probe pads. After taking away the pad parasitics of 
the thru standard, the per-unit-length transmission-line 
parameters can be extracted to reproduce and de-embed 
the interconnect parasitics in gate, drain, and source 
terminals of a MOSFET. 
2.2 Fixture Modeling and Scaling 
To de-embed the unwanted parasitics of the DUT, the 
parasitic networks composed of pad and interconnect 
elements should be precisely reproduced from the open, 
short, and thru standards. Fig. 2(a) exhibits the semi-
distributed model for the fixtured MOSFET. Here the 
shielding technique is employed to improve the scalability 
of probe-pads [10]. The probe-pad parasitics, which 
include the shunt admittance and series impedance, can be 
evaluated from the open and short standards shown in Figs. 
2(b)-(c). The chain scattering matrices of the probe-pad 
parasitics in port 1 and port 2 are

And then, the chain scattering matrices [T1], [T2], and [T3] 
can be converted to their scattering matrices [S1], [S2], and 
[S3]. We can now apply microwave network theory to shift 
the reference planes to the terminal planes of the intrinsic 
device network. The detailed de-embedding procedure is 
summarized as follows:

3. Results and Discussion 
To validate the proposed de-embedding theory, the DUT 
and its corresponding de-embedding standards were 
fabricated using a standard five-metal-layer CMOS process. 
The NMOS transistor with the dimensions of channel 
length (Lg) = 0.24 µm and channel width (Wg) = 160 µm (5 
µm × 32 fingers) was connected in a two-port ground-
signal-ground (GSG) configuration. The lengths of the 10-
µm wide interconnects between the probe pads and the 
transistor are l1 = l2 = 50 µm and l3 = 42 µm. The DC 
measurements of the MOSFET test fixture were performed 
in the Kelvin connection with an Agilent 4142B Modular 
DC Source/Monitor, and the two-port S-parameter 
measurements were accomplished with an Agilent 8510C 
Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and Cascade Microtech 
Infinity microwave probes. Before S-parameter 
measurements, the measurement system was calibrated 
using the Short-Open-Load-Thru (SOLT) calibration 
procedure with a ceramic impedance standard substrate 
(ISS). 
3.1 Characteristics of On-Wafer De-Embedding 
Standards 
As referred to Fig. 1, the open and short standards are 
shielded with metal layer (M1) to mitigate the substrate 
coupling. Figure 4(a) shows the resistance and inductance 
of short standards, and Fig. 4(b) shows the conductance 
and capacitance of open standards extracted as

where ω is the angular frequency. Here we compare the 
small test fixtures to the large ones, which are respectively
