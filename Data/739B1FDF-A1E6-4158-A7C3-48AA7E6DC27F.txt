SUMMARY
In this paper, a non-linear recursive formulation is developed for kinematic and dynamic analysis of
open-loop mechanical systems. The non-linear equations of motion are developed for deformable links
that undergo large translational and rotational displacements. These equations are formulated in terms
of a set of time invariant scalars and matrices that depend on the spatial co-ordinates as well as the
assumed displacement field, and these time invariant quantities represent the dynamic coupling between
the rigid-body modes and elastic deformations. A new recursive formulation is presented for solving
equations of motion for open-loop chains consisting of interconnected rigid and deformable open-loop
mechanical systems. This formulation is expressed by the recursive relationships and the generalized non-
linear equations for deformable mechanical systems to obtain a large system of loosely coupled equations
of motion. The main processor program consists of three main modules: constraint module, mass module
and force module. The constraint module is used to numerically evaluate the relationship between the
absolute and joint accelerations. The mass module is used to numerically evaluate the system mass matrix
as well as the non-linear Coriolis and centrifugal forces associated with the absolute, joint and elastic
co-ordinates. Simultaneously, the force module is used to numerically evaluate the generalized external
and elastic forces associated with the absolute, joint and elastic co-ordinates. Computational efficiency
is achieved by taking advantage of the structure of the resulting system of loosely coupled equations.
The solution techniques used in this investigation yield a much smaller operations count and can more
efficiently implement in any computer. The algorithms and solutions presented in this paper are illustrated
by using an industrial robotic manipulator system. The numerical results using this formulation are also
presented and discussed in this paper. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2. BASIC KINEMATIC EQUATIONS
Figure 1 indicates a deformable link i in a 3-D space. Let Xi Yi Zi be the selected deformable
body co-ordinate system with origin Oi . The configuration of the rigid frame in the global XYZ
co-ordinate system is identified using a set of reference co-ordinates ti and hi . The vector ti is a
three-dimensional vector that defines the global position of the origin Oi of deformable link. The
vector hi is a set of generalized rotational co-ordinates that define the orientation of deformable
link. The angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors can be defined in the global co-ordinate
system and written in terms of the time derivatives of generalized rotational co-ordinates as
xi = Gi h˙i (1a)
ai = Gi h¨i + G˙i h˙i (1b)
The angular velocity and angular acceleration vectors can be defined in the local co-ordinate
system and written in terms of the time derivatives of generalized rotational co-ordinates as
xi = Gi h˙i (2a)
ai = Gi h¨i + G˙i h˙i (2b)
where the matrices Gi , Gi , G˙i and G˙i depend on the set of generalized rotational co-ordinates hi
and the time derivative of generalized rotational co-ordinates h˙i . If Euler parameters are used to
describe the orientation of deformable body reference, the matrices Gi and Gi are 3 × 4 matrices

is the elastic position vector of the point which can be expressed in terms of
uei = Si qei (10)
where Si is the space shape function matrix and qei is time dependent vector of generalized elastic
co-ordinates.
3. NON-LINEAR RECURSIVE KINEMATIC FORMULATION
Using the basic kinematic equations mentioned in previous section, the form of constrained
relationships defined by Shabana [9] and Hwang [10, 11] is useful in developing recursive kinematic
equations for open-loop mechanical systems consisting of interconnected rigid and deformable
links. These equations are called generalized Newton–Euler equations and can be written in a
matrix form as
mq¨ = f (11)
where mass matrix m, acceleration vector q¨ and force vector f are defined as
m =
⎡⎢⎢⎣
mt t mtr mte
mr t mrr mre
met mer mee
⎤⎥⎥⎦ (12)
where subscript t denotes the quantities associated with the translational co-ordinates, subscript r
denotes the quantities associated with the rotational co-ordinates, subscript e denotes the quantities
associated with the elastic co-ordinates, and subscript with different characters joined together
denotes the quantities associated with the related co-ordinates. For instance, subscript re and er
defines the couplings between the rotational co-ordinates and elastic co-ordinates.
q¨ =[t¨ T r¨T q¨e T]T (13)
and
f =[fTt fTr fTe ]T (14)
where superscript T denotes the transposition of the vectors or matrices, t¨ denotes the component
vector of translational acceleration, r¨ denotes the component vector of rotational acceleration, and
q¨e denotes the component vector of elastic acceleration of the mechanical system that consists of
interconnected deformable links.
Figure 2 shows two deformable links labelled i − 1 and i , and connected by a cylindrical
joint. Link reference co-ordinate systems Xi−1Yi−1Zi−1 and Xi Yi Zi with origins Oi−1 and
Oi are introduced to define translational and rotational displacement fields relative to a global
frame XYZ. Let global position vectors ti−1 and ti locate the origins of link i − 1 and link i .
In general, link-fixed joint co-ordinate systems X ji−1Y ji−1Z ji−1 and X ji Y ji Z ji are introduced at thejoint definition points ji−1 and ji as shown in Figure 3. Large relative displacements between
these link-fixed joint co-ordinate systems on different deformable links (due to joint translational

KINEMATIC AND DYNAMIC ANALYSIS 1135
In this paper, the kinematic and dynamic equations are derived in global co-ordinates.
Generally, bold lowercase and bold uppercase alphabets denote respective algebraic represen-
tation of vectors and matrices. The bold Greek alphabets x, a and b also denote algebraic vector
quantities. From Figure 2, the angular velocity of link i in global co-ordinate system can be
expressed in terms of link i − 1 in the recursive form
xi =xi−1 + x ji−1 − x ji + v ji−1˙i, i−1 (16)
where xi and xi−1 are the angular velocity vectors of link i and link i − 1 in global co-ordinate
systems, x ji−1 is the angular velocity of joint co-ordinate system X ji−1Y ji−1Z ji−1 with respect to
link i − 1 reference co-ordinate system Xi−1Yi−1Zi−1, x ji is the angular velocity of the joint
co-ordinate system X ji Y
j
i Z
j
i with respect to link i reference co-ordinate system Xi Yi Zi and the
vector v ji−1 is a unit vector lying along the joint axis of translation and rotation which can be
assumed to be attached on link i − 1 defined as
v
j
i−1 = Ai−1v ji−1 (17)
The angular velocities x ji−1 and x
j
i are small rotations of respective joint co-ordinate systems
with respect to their corresponding local co-ordinate systems due to elastic link deformations. It is
more efficient to work in local co-ordinate systems because of many vector and matrix quantities
due to elastic deformations are constant. The quantities in link i − 1 and link i local co-ordinate
systems can be related by matrix Ai, i−1 and basic identity
Ai, i−1 =
[
I3 + v˜ ji−1 sin i, i−1 + 2(˜v ji−1)2 sin2
(
i, i−1
2
)]
A0i, i−1 (18)
where A0i, i−1 is a constant transformation matrix corresponding to the condition i, i−1 equals to
zero. The skew-symmetric matrix v˜ ji−1 is equivalent to a vector cross product operator that is
associated with the vector v ji−1, and I3 is a 3 × 3 identity matrix. Thus, Equation (16) can be
expressed as
xi =xi−1 + Ai−1x ji−1 − Aix ji + v ji−1˙i, i−1 (19)
The angular velocity vectors in local frame can be written in terms of the elastic co-ordinates
of links i − 1 and i as
x ji−1 = Sr
j
i−1q˙ei−1 (20a)
x ji = Sr
j
i q˙
e
i (20b)
Constant matrices Sr ji−1 and Sr
j
i as defined by Shabana [9] and Hwang [11] depend only on the
link shape functions associated with small rotations due to elastic deformation and the relative
location of nodal points on the deformable links. Vectors q˙ei−1 and q˙
e
i are the respective elastic
co-ordinate derivatives with respect to time of links i − 1 and i .
The angular acceleration vector of link i can be written in terms of link i − 1 as
ai = ai−1 + v ji−1¨i, i−1 + Ai−1Sr

to yield the following recursive kinematic equations in a compact matrix form:
q¨i = Hqi, i−1q¨i−1 + Hpi p¨i + bi (30)
The vectors in Equation (30) are defined as
q¨i = [¨tTi aTi q¨e Ti ]T (31)
q¨i−1 = [¨tTi−1 aTi−1 q¨e Ti−1]T (32)
p¨i = [¨i, i−1 ¨i, i−1 q¨e Ti ]T (33)
bi = [(bti + u˜ ji bri )T br Ti 0T]T (34)
The constrained Jacobian matrix are defined as
Hqi, i−1 =

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎦ (36)
In Equations (29) and (36), the rank of identity matrix Iei depends on the number of elastic
co-ordinates of link i . In this investigation, the formulation is designed and illustrated by using
cylindrical joint. For the cases of revolute, prismatic and rigid joint kinematic equations, as well as
more sophisticated joint types can be obtained as special cases of the cylindrical joint kinematic
equations. The values of ¨i, j−1, ¨i, i−1 or both are constant for the revolute, prismatic or rigid
joints. Equation (30) can be expressed explicitly from the base to the end of open-loop mechanical
systems as a set of equations of motion. For the open-loop mechanical systems interconnected
with rigid and deformable links, Equation (30) can be expressed explicitly from the base to the
end as a set of equations of motion. Consequently, these equations of motion can be written in a
compact matrix form as
q¨ = Hpp¨ + b (37)

where
Mgi = CTi Mi Ci (48)
fgi = CTi fi (49)
Clearly, the system dynamic equations of Equation (47) (from link 1 to link i) can be combined
together in a system matrix form
Mgq¨ = fg (50)
where system acceleration vector q¨ is defined by Equation (38), system mass matrix Mg and
system force vector fg are defined as
Mg =
⎡⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

⎤⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
(51)
fg = [fg T1 fg T2 · · · fg Ti−1 fg Ti ] (52)
Substituting Equation (37) into Equation (50) and rewriting it, a system matrix equation based
on non-linear recursive formulation can be obtained. This system equation can be expressed as
Mpp¨ = fp (53)
where p¨ is defined by Equation (39), Mp and fp are defined as
Mp = Hp TMgHp (54)
fp = Hp Tfg − Hp TMgb (55)
where the matrices Hp and Mg are defined by Equations (41) and (51), and the vectors b and fg
are defined by Equations (40) and (52), respectively. Thus, the related joint acceleration vector
p¨ can be solved using appropriate numerical methods such as Runge–Kutta method if the mass
matrix Mp and the force vector fp are calculated and given.

5.2. Effect of deformation
Using Figure 3, the transformation matrix Ai of link i can be expressed in terms of the transfor-
mation matrix Ai−1 of link i − 1 as
Ai = Ai−1A ji−1A ji, i−1A j Ti (59)
where A ji−1 is the transformation matrix that defines the orientation of the joint co-ordinate system
X ji−1Y
j
i−1Z
j
i−1 with respect to the link co-ordinate system Xi−1Yi−1Zi−1, A
j
i is the transformation
matrix that defines the orientation of the joint co-ordinate system X ji Y ji Z ji with respect to the
link co-ordinate system Xi Yi Zi , and the transformation matrix A ji, i−1 is defined by Equation (56).
Substituting Equation (56) into Equation (59), one obtains
Ai = Ai−1Ai, i−1 (60)
where the transformation matrix Ai, i−1 that defines the orientation of link i with respect to link
i − 1 is given by
Ai, i−1 = A ji−1Ari, i−1A0i, i−1A j Ti (61)
Using Equation (60), one obtains the following recursive relationship:
An = A1
n∑
k=2
Ak,k−1 (62)
where A1 is the transformation matrix that defines the orientation of link 1 with respect to the
global co-ordinate system and Ak,k−1 is the transformation matrix that defines orientation of the
co-ordinate system of link k with respect to the co-ordinate system of link k − 1. In special case
of rigid body analysis, the matrices A ji−1 and A
j
i of Equation (61) reduce to the identity matrices.
Thus, Equations (60) and (61) reduce to
Ai = Ai−1Ari, i−1A0i, i−1 (63)
Ai, i−1 = Ari, i−1A0i, i−1 (64)
5.3. Angular velocity vector
The absolute angular velocity vector xi of the co-ordinate system of link i can be expressed in
terms of the absolute angular velocity vector xi−1 of the co-ordinate system of link i − 1 as
xi =xi−1 + x ji−1 + xri, i−1 − x ji (65)
where x ji and x
j
i−1 are, respectively, the angular velocity vectors of the intermediate joint
co-ordinate systems X ji Y
j
i Z
j
i and X
j
i−1Y
j
i−1Z
j
i−1 with respect to their link co-ordinate systems,
and xri, i−1 is the relative angular velocity of the intermediate joint co-ordinate system X ji Y ji Z ji
with respect to the intermediate joint co-ordinate system X ji−1Y ji−1Z ji−1. Equation (65) can be
written compactly as
xi =xi−1 + xi, i−1 (66)

(4) The absolute transformation matrix and angular velocity vector of deformable links
common to each joint in the system are evaluated. The arguments calculated include the
joint number, the numbering of the links common to this joint, the initial relative orienta-
tion of the two links as described by the matrix A0k,k−1 and the local position of the joint
definition points.
(5) The matrices A ji and A ji−1 are evaluated using the infinitesimal rotations at the joint
definition points as
A ji = I3 + h˜
j
i and A
j
i−1 = I3 + h˜
j
i−1 (70)
where h˜ ji and h˜
j
i−1 are, respectively, the skew symmetric matrices associated with the vectors
h ji and h
j
i−1. The angular velocity vectors x
j
i , x
j
i−1 and xri, i−1 can also be evaluated in
this subroutine and defined as
x ji = Ai Sr
j
i q˙
e
i and x
j
i−1 = Ai−1Sr
j
i−1q˙ei−1 (71)
xri, i−1 = v ji−1˙i, i−1 (72)
where Sr ji and Sr
j
i−1 are two constant matrices that depend on the assumed deformation
mode shapes of links i and i − 1, respectively, q˙ei and q˙ei−1 are the vectors of generalized
modal velocities of links i and i − 1, respectively, and v ji−1 is a unit vector along the joint
axis whose components are defined in global co-ordinate system.
(6) The transformation matrix Ari, i−1 and Ai can be evaluated from Equation (57) and
Equation (59). The position vectors u ji and u ji−1 can be evaluated and defined as
u
j
i = (u ji )0 + Ai St
j
i q
e
i and u
j
i−1 = (u ji−1)0 + Ai−1St

where (u ji )
0 and (u ji−1)0 are the position vectors of the joint definition points in the
undeformed state, St ji and St
j
i−1 are two constant matrices that depend on the assumed
deformation mode shapes of links i and i − 1, respectively.
(7) The global components of the vector v ji−1 can be obtained once the finite and infinitesimal
rotation matrices are determined. Using the components of this vector and the current value
of the joint rate ˙i, i−1, the angular velocity vector xn can be evaluated recursively as
described by Equation (68).
6.1. Constraint module
In this section, the computational procedures for evaluating the transformation matrices and the
angular velocities of deformable links in open-loop mechanical systems are discussed. Clearly,
the Jacobians Hqi, i−1 and H
p
i , and the quadratic velocity vector bi of Equation (30) depend on
the transformation matrices as well as the angular velocity vectors. Several terms which are used
in evaluating the transformation matrices and the angular velocity vectors are also required in
evaluating the matrices Hqi, i−1 and H
p
i , and the vector bi . Therefore, the results obtained in the
steps outlined in the preceding section can also be used for the computation of the Jacobian

subroutines. The elastic forces which are simply the product of the stiffness matrix and the vector
of elastic co-ordinates are evaluated. The effect of forces such as gravity is evaluated. Note that
in deformable structure dynamics, a force that acts at a point on a deformable link is equivalent
to a system, defined at the reference point that consists of the same force a moment that depends
on the deformation of the link, and a set of generalized elastic forces associated with the link
generalized elastic co-ordinates. The Coriolis and centrifugal forces depend on the finite rotations,
angular velocities as well as elastic co-ordinates and velocities. Knowing the transformation matrix
and angular velocity vector from the constraint module and knowing qei and q˙
e
i as the result of
numerical integrations, the Coriolis and centrifugal forces can be evaluated in a straightforward
manner. Observe that if the external force vector is a constant vector such as gravity force, some
vectors can be evaluated in advance in a preprocessor program and used as part of the input to
a main processor program. Similar comments apply to the case of moments, since a moment in
deformable structure dynamics is no longer a free vector. It is defined by its magnitude, direction
and its point of application.
