Abstract 
 
Deformation due to excavations in urban areas is one of the important problems geotechnical engineers 
have to cope with. Numerical methods are often employed to assess the deformation behavior of deep 
excavations. However, many uncertainties associated with the geotechnical system are significant. It 
seems logical to combine numerical modeling with mathematical concepts representing the uncertainties. 
The present paper shows the random finite element method (RFEM) provides a convenient tool to 
account for the scatter in material and model parameters and thus can significantly increase the value of 
numerical analysis. The RFEM combined random fields of soil properties with the finite element method 
through Monte-Carlo simulations. A well-documented excavation case history is employed to evaluate 
the influence of uncertainties. This study shows the RFEM can be used to provide reasonable estimates 
of the exceeding probability of deflection caused by excavation.

深開挖工程無可避免的會造成土體的解壓，而引致地盤的變位，在人口密集的都會地區，往
往造成鄰產及公共工程的損失。因此；如何在設計階段，即能準確地預測開挖工程所引致的地盤
變位，以事先預防過大的地盤變位，確保深開挖工程的安全，一直是大地工程師努力的目標。 
在深開挖工程的分析與設計上，有限元素法是一個十分實用的分析工具，已有許多文獻證實
有限元素法在深開挖工程分析上的適用性[1-11]。但是傳統的有限元素法是將土壤參數、荷載等設
計參數視為定值，屬於一種定值性的分析法，亦即分析時輸入定值的參數，從而得到定值的分析
結果。然而土壤是一種複雜的非線性力學介質，有諸多因素影響開挖區內外土壤的工程行為，且
土體力學參數存在不確定性與隨機性，同時分析的方法亦具備度的不確定性，傳統的有限元素法
並不考慮這些涵蓋隨機型(Aleatory Type)及知識型(Epistemic Type)的不確定性，因而常導致人為地
過高或過低考慮了安全儲備，造成開挖工程造價不必要的增高或引起工程事故。

ABSTRACT 
 
Deformation caused by excavations in urban areas is one of important 
problems geotechnical engineers have to cope with. The excavation-induced 
deformations deterministically estimated by conventional empirical/numerical 
methods can not consider the uncertainties of geotechnical engineering system. In this 
regard, the random finite element method (RFEM) is employed to investigate the 
influence of uncertainty on excavation-induced deformation. The RFEM combined 
random fields of soil properties with the finite element method through the Monte 
Carlo simulation. A well-documented excavation case history is employed in the 
RFEM analysis. Analysis results show that the RFEM is capable of providing 
reasonable estimations of the exceeding probability of wall deflection caused by 
excavation. The RFEM has a potential to be a convenient tool to account for the 
scatter in material and model parameters and thus can significantly upgrade the 
applicability and value of numerical analysis. 
  
INSTRODUCTION 
 
Prevention of damage to buildings adjacent to excavation is recognized as one 
of the most important tasks in the design of braced excavation in urban area. This task 
can be achieved through the prediction of excavation-induced wall and ground 
movements, with which the potential of damage to adjacent buildings can be 
estimated. In practice, the engineer often adopts the magnitude of retaining wall 
deflection as in indicator to evaluate the potential of damage to a building. Therefore, 
it is necessary to incorporate a suitable predictive method for estimating excavation-
induced ground movements in the excavation design. 
In the analysis of excavation, the finite element method (FEM) has been 
extensively applied to estimate the excavation-induced deformation. It should be 
noted that such deformation analysis using the FEM is deterministic, which means 
the model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty cannot be appropriately considered 
in the analysis. In other words, the computed wall and ground movements cannot 
reflect the degree of uncertainty of the random variables. This study combined the 
concept of random fields of soil properties and the Monte Carlo simulation into the 
FEM as random finite element method (RFEM). The RFEM can be used to conduct 
the probabilistic analysis to estimate the retaining wall deflection. In this study, a 
well-documented excavation case history is analyzed using the RFEM. The objective

 sandy layers. The MPP model, a simplified small-strain soil model validated by Kung 
et al. (2007), is used to represent the undrained behavior of clay. For simplicity, the 
MPP model is not introduced in detail here, and the reader can be referred to Kung et 
al. (2007) for details. 
 
EXCAVATION CASE HISTORY 
 
An excavation case history (called the Lurie Center) on the Chicago campus 
of the Northwestern University documented by Finno and Roboski (2005) is 
employed to conduct the probabilistic analysis of the deflection of retaining wall in 
the present study. A plan view of the area, approximately 80 m × 68 m in size, is 
shown in Figure 2. The four stage excavation is supported by a hot-rolled PZ-27 sheet 
pile wall on all sides, and the average maximum excavation depth is 12.8 m. The 
groundwater level was located at a depth of about 3 m. Figure 3 shows the 
stratigraphy and construction activities.

Two levels of tied-back ground anchors are installed on the east wall owing to 
the presence of the basement of the Prentice Pavilion. These levels of tied-back 
anchors provided lateral support on the other three walls. Design ground anchor loads 
were 623, 534, and 623 kN for the first, second, and third levels, respectively. The 
anchors were installed at a horizontal spacing of 2.74 m on the first level and 1.83 m 
on the second and third levels. Both the first- and second-level anchors are founded in 
beach sand. All anchors were locked off to a prestress of 100% of the design load. 
The angles of tied-back installation are 20°, 10°, and 30° for the first, second, and 
third levels, respectively.

 PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS ON WALL DEFLECTION  
 
The soil and structure parameters used in the RFEM analysis are determined 
based on Kung et al. (2007), as shown in Table 1. Note that the sheet-pile wall was 
simulated by the solid element with the same bending and axial stiffness, and the 
equivalent thickness and modulus of the wall were determined based on the 
suggestion by Day and Potts (1993). The equivalent stiffness of anchors calculated by 
the horizontal spacing and the nominal stiffness is used in the analysis. 
The stiffness modulus of soil is very sensitive to effects of sample disturbance 
and errors of testing equipment (Burland, 1989; Kung 2007). According to Tang and 
Kung (2010), the stiffness modulus and undrained shear strength of clay are two 
predominant factors in the FEM analysis of excavation. For simplicity, only the 
uncertainty of stiffness modulus of soil is considered in the analysis of this study. 
Specifically, the stiffness moduli, K for sandy layers and Ei /su for clayey layers, are 
selected to consider the uncertainty. The Lurie case history is analyzed in this study 
using the proposed RFEM. The soil parameters used in the RFEM are shown in Table 
1 as proposed by Kung et al. (2007). The K and Ei /su shown in Table 1 represent the 
mean values. As to the determination of the uncertainty of K and Ei /su, this study 
adopted five scenarios of coefficient of variation (COV= 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) to 
conduct the RFEM analysis, respectively.

Note that the Gaussian assumption would lead to an estimation of uncertainty 
regarding data, it suffers from the limitation that the normal distribution is not 
representative of real data for the stiffness modulus (which is always positive) and, 
for this reason, lognormal probability density function for the input random variables 
will be considered in the following analysis.  
For ensuring the accuracy of RFEM analysis and upgrade the efficiency of 
Monte Carlo simulations, various simulation numbers are selected to conduct the 
excavation deformation analysis to determine the adequate simulation number. Note 
that COV=0.3 is used in the analysis. Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation 
of maximum deflection of retaining wall at various stages with different simulation 
number. Use of the simulation number of 1000 for RFEM analysis on the excavation 
case history is considered appropriate. Then, other four scenarios of COV (0.1, 0.2, 
0.4, and 0.5) are performed using the proposed number of 1000.

where Φ  denotes standard normal probabilities; x  is random variable; λ  and ξ , are 
the parameters of the lognormal distribution, which represent the mean and standard 
deviation of xln , respectively. 
To facilitate probabilistic assessments of excavation-induced wall deflection, 
a simplified chart for estimating maximum deflection of retaining wall caused by 
excavation is established in Figure 6. In this figure, the probability of exceeding with 
respect to various maximum deflection of retaining wall in the Lurie case can be 
determined for stages 3 and 4. For example, when the maximum wall deflection is 
equal to 80mm at excavation stage 4, the probability of exceeding with respect to 
COV=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 are 0.2%, 9.2%, 24.9%, 37.5%, and 45.7%, 
respectively. The results show that even though the same wall deflection is obtained 
in the analysis, various levels of risk may be encountered in light of various degree of 
uncertainty of soil parameters. This chart may provide additional valuable 
information to engineers for assessing the probability of exceeding of the maximum

CONCLUSIONS 
 
This study applied the RFEM in terms of a probabilistic approach to analyze 
the excavation-induced wall deflection. The RFEM approach involves the Monte 
Carlo simulation and random variables with specified joint probability distributions to 
consider the geotechnical uncertainty. The probability of computed maximum 
deflection of retaining wall caused by excavation can be determined through RFEM 
analysis. The wall deflection observed by a well-documented excavation case history 
is re-analyzed by the proposed RFEM. The results show that even though the same 
wall deflection is obtained by the deformation analysis, various levels of risk may be

 conduct the probabilistic analysis. The analysis results are then used to discuss the 
applicability of probability analysis in the basal heave analysis of excavation and 
some conclusions are drawn.  
 
METHOD OF BASAL HEAVE ANALYSIS 
 
The method of basal heave analysis in the Taiwan building code is adopted to 
conduct the probabilistic analysis of an excavation case in the present study. 
Specifically, the formula of basal heave analysis in the Taiwan building code (TGS, 
2001), in which a circular failure surface centered at the lowest strut (see Figure 1) is 
assumed, is very similar to that proposed by Terzaghi (1943). The factor of safety (FS) 
against basal heave is defined by the ratio of the resisting moment (Mr) to the driving 
moment (Md) of the lowest strut as follows:

where su is the undrained shear strength of clay; R is the radius of the failure arc; W is 
the total weight of the soil; q is the surcharge above the excavation surface within a R 
wide area outside the retaining construction; θ is the angle between the failure surface 
and the horizontal direction; α is the angle of failure arc in excavation zone and can 
be obtained by )/(cos 1 Rh−=α  where h is the distance from the lowest strut to the 
excavation surface. 
 
EXCAVATION CASE HISTORY 
 
An excavation case history, in which the basal heave failure has been 
recorded and re-analyzed by Hsieh et al. (2008), is employed to conduct the 
probabilistic analysis of basal heave in the present study. The dimension of the 
excavation case is about 100 m long and 26 m wide. A diaphragm wall, 24 m in depth 
and 0.7 m in thickness, was used as a retaining wall. The final excavation depth was 
13.45 m. Figure 2 shows the stratigraphy and construction sequences. The excavation 
case is located at the backfill zone of a deserted watercourse. The level ranging from 
GL –10.7 to –44.7 m was the soft silty clay (CL). The groundwater level was 
approximately at GL –2.8 m. Hsieh et al. (2008) indicated that the basal heave failure 
occurred about 2.5 hours after the final stage of excavation had been completed (at 
GL –13.45 m). The entire internal bracing system collapsed in this event of basal 
heave failure.

 compression test. Their study concluded that the undrained shear strength determined 
by the triaxial unconsolidated undrained test is suitable for the isotropic basal heave 
analysis using the Taiwan building code, whereas the FS calculated from the triaxial 
K0-consolidated undrained axial compression test tends to be higher and therefore not 
suitable for basal heave analysis. The FS obtained from the field vane shear test tends 
to be irregular. Therefore, only the undrained shear strength determined by the UU 
test is adopted to conduct the probabilistic analysis in the present study.  
Figure 3 reveals the results of UU tests on the undisturbed samples taken from 
the layer at depths from -10.7m to -30m in this excavation site. The undrained shear 
strength of clay at various depths must be determined for the calculation of factor of 
safety against basal heave. Due to the limited results of UU tests, those data points 
are used to determine a simplified profile of undrained shear strength with depth for 
the intended probabilistic analysis of basal heave in the following section. In addition, 
the in-situ measurements show that the pore-water pressure obtained with electronic 
piezometers is nearly hydrostatic. For simplicity, other basic soil properties for this 
silty clay layer are not shown herein and can be referred to Hsieh et al. (2008).

PROBABILISTIC ANALYSIS FOR BASAL HEAVE 
 
As expressed in Equation 1, five parameters are required in the analysis of 
basal heave, that is, R, W, α, q and su. The former four parameters can be precisely 
determined (fixed values) provided the excavation design is completed.  Therefore, 
only the uncertainty of the latest parameter (su) must be provided for the probabilistic 
analysis of basal heave. According to past studies (e.g., Phoon 1999), the coefficient 
of variation (COV) for undrained shear strength of clay varies within a wide range. 
For instance, Phoon (1999) indicated that the COV values of medium clay would fall 
in the range from 0.11 to 0.49. The mean value of COV is 0.22. The UU test has been 
extensively conducted in Taipei silty clay over the past decades. It may be difficult to

 employed as a criterion to compute the probability of failure although it may not 
necessarily reflect the real failure situation.

Figure 5. Definitions of probability of basal heave failure 
 
Figure 6 reveals the results of probabilistic analysis for basal heave failure. 
For the definition of FS=1.0, the probability of failure would increase with the 
increase of COV. However, for the scenario of FS=1.2, the opposite trend, that 
probability of failure decreases with the increase of COV, can be obtained. Note that 
it is not appropriate to conclude that the excavation design is relatively safe when 
higher COV of undrained shear strength is given. As shown in Figure 6, the accuracy 
in estimating the probability of failure against basal heave with two scenarios 
(FS=1.0 and FS=1.2) would be significantly reduced with the increase of COV.  
As shown in Figure 6, when COV is equal to 0.2, the estimated probability of 
failure is approximately equal to 0.8 with FS=1.2 and 0.4 with FS=1.0, respectively. 
These results reflect that the probability that the original excavation design would not 
meet the requirement of the Taiwan building code based on the results of re-
investigation of soil properties in this case is as high as 80%, while the probability of 
basal heave failure is about 40%, which is considered really high. Compared with the 
original analysis of basal heave in this case, the undrained shear strength of clay 
adopted in the original analysis is relatively higher than that determined by the UU 
tests conducted by Hsieh et al. (2008).  
As shown in Figure 4, the factor of safety against basal heave calculated by 
the deterministic analysis (Equation 1) is 1.05 greater than 1.0. It may be concluded 
that the design of excavation is safe in theory although the factor of safety is lower 
than the requirement of the design code. However, the probability of failure is about 
40% in this case. Use of probabilistic analysis can provide more information to 
engineers to judge the rationality of engineering design. Also, this result reflects that 
it is very crucial to make every effort to conduct the high-quality test and determine 
the appropriate soil parameters, irrespective of use of deterministic analysis or 
probabilistic analysis.
