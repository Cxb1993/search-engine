relationships of traffic flow at different adjacent locations is appropriate and necessary.  
 In this paper, an approach for the space-time modeling of traffic flow for urban roads is 
proposed. The univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, which 
has been implemented successfully in the traffic flow forecasting problem [4], [5], is extended. 
A space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (space-time ARIMA, or STARIMA) 
model is introduced in this paper to develop a multivariate yet computational efficient 
approach taking into account the physical space-time relationships for detector locations. 
Some practical considerations and specifications for urban traffic network are discussed. 
II. METHODS FOR SHORT-TERM TRAFFIC FORECASTING 
Forecast implies prediction of future events and conditions [6], and forecasting of traffic 
conditions in the near future is essential in the applications of traffic management and control 
in Intelligent Transportation Systems. A wide variety of short-term traffic forecasting 
problems have been investigated during past decades, and the scopes of them were diverse [7]. 
For the purpose of traffic management in urban arterials, models to understand the traffic for a 
wide area of the network are particularly necessary. The exploitation of multivariate time 
series techniques may provide better insight and interpretation of the hidden relationships. 
The modelling of spatial-temporal domain of traffic data has been receiving attention recently. 
Yue and Yeh [2] investigated the spatio-temporal dependency of traffic flow, and identified 
that the cross-correlation and time lags between stations would be different for different time 
period (e.g. morning period, evening period and off-peak) and traffic conditions. Cheng et al. 
[3] also obtained similar conclusions with an empirical investigation using London's road 
network data, and they concluded that spatio-temporal network autocorrelation structure 
should be dynamic and heterogeneous in both space and time. 
III. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 
The space-time autoregressive integrated moving average (STARIMA) model is 
characterized with the autoregressive and moving average forms of multiple time series 
lagged in both space and time to incorporate the spatial correlations of the time series data [8]. 
It can be viewed as a special case of the vector ARMA (VARMA) model. VARMA is a 
multivariate version of ARMA, and supposes a general relationship of dependences between 
multiple time series [9]. It requires estimation of covariance matrix of the time series, and 
therefore the number of parameters to be estimated is a multiple of the square of the time 
series number. When the number of time series is large, it is generally difficult to calibrate a 
VARMA model in real applications.  
STARIMA assumes a restricted form of the covariance matrix by specifying a spatial 
dependence structure of the time series measured over a space, and the number of coefficients 
in the model can be reduced. This is an appropriate assumption for the traffic measurements in 
4 
 
term.

C. Modeling procedure 
The modeling procedure of STARIMA is iterative between model identification, model 
estimation and diagnostic checking. Model identification is to determine the suitable temporal 
orders ( )qp,  and the corresponding spatial orders ( )qp mmm ,...,,;,...,, 1111 λλλ . Examining 
the space-time sample autocorrelations and space-time sample partial autocorrelations of the 
time series is a procedure to identify the appropriate orders.  
As mentioned in [11], there are different definitions of autocorrelation and partial 
correlation functions for space-time modeling. For space-time autocorrelation with constant 
variances at all spatial lags, [8] suggested that the formulation of space-time autocorrelation 
between thl and thk order neighbors at time lag s can be given by

The space-time partial autocorrelation does not have a closed form formulation, and its 
determination is not straight forward. It can be derived from the general form of STAR model 
(i.e. a model with q = 0) with transformation  [8]. A STAR model with order k in time and 
λλ =k  in space can be expressed as 
6 
 
(http://tms.bote.taipei.gov.tw/). Traffic data, including traffic volume, speed and occupancy, 
were recorded every 5 minutes.  Since there are traffic signals in the urban area with cycle 
length of approximately three minutes, the variability of the traffic flow within a short time is 
strong. Therefore, the 5-min data are aggregated into 15-min intervals in the analysis, and 
there are 96 observations each day. 
Data sets were collected since 29th June 2009 for four weeks, and the data shows daily and 
weekly seasonal pattern. The data of the first nine days are used for estimation of the model 
parameters, and the data of the following day are used for validation and demonstration of the 
model forecasting performances. As the proposed models require that the data to be no 
missing, occasional missing values are interpolated with the immediate before and after 
values in the time series. 
B. Modeling with Seasonal ARIMA  
A prior study [14] by the authors using the same set of data determined that (2, 0, 1)×(0, 1, 
1)96 is a better model with smaller estimation and forecasting discrepancies, and the resultant 
model is a linear recursive estimator

where tyˆ  and ty  are the forecasted and observed flow values at time t.  
C. Modeling with STARIMA  
Traffic characteristics and network topology are incorporated into the spatial modeling by 
defining a hierarchical structure for the neighboring relationships of the locations of the 
detectors. The first order and second order neighbors for each detector are defined in Table I, 
and the corresponding weighting matrices are determined with (10). To identify the tentative 
model, we examine the pattern of the space-time sample autocorrelations and partial 
autocorrelations, which are calculated as in Table II. The sample autocorrelations indicate that 
there is a spike at spatial lag 0 and temporal lag 96 for the seasonal order. At the non-seasonal 
level, the magnitudes of values seem to be large at time lag 2 for spatial lags 0. The 
corresponding moving average terms are included in the model tentatively. The sample partial 
autocorrelations also indicate that there is a spike at spatial lag 0 and temporal lag 96 for the 
seasonal order and a cut off at time lag 2 for the non-seasonal order, and we include these 
terms in the autoregressive part.  
Various combinations of the parameters are experimented, and it is an iterative process to 
identify, estimate and reformulate the model. The final model is

Abstract: Reducing the private vehicle ownership and usage is one of the key challenges in 
the development of a sustainable transportation system. However, to evaluate the 
effectiveness of a policy, it is necessary to understand the factors that influence the 
preferences and behavior of travelers. In this paper, the characteristics of household vehicle 
ownership level for cars and motorcycles in Macao are investigated. A discrete choice 
approach is used to estimate the number of vehicles that a household would own using 
disaggregate household survey data. The result suggests that income has positive effect on 
both car and motorcycle ownership. Car ownership level is higher at lower population density 
at residential location, whereas motorcycle is more popular at high population density area.
