Abstract 
 
Broadcast encryption is a technique of sending encrypted messages to arbitrary groups of 
users in public channels. When applied to large systems like pay-TV, the existing 
symmetric-key-setting schemes usually suffer high transmission costs, and thus many efforts 
have been made to improve the transmission performance. However, tremendous additional 
computation cost or storage requirements are often the price. In this project, we have developed a 
symmetric-key-setting scheme called BDSD and its variant, BDSDλ. By enlarging the subset 
collection of the subset difference scheme (SD) with some special subsets, the proposed schemes 
keep the excellent computational performance of SD, while providing better transmission 
performance. Moreover, the BDSDλ scheme has the capability of tradeoff between the 
transmission costs and storage requirements. Considering the price of computation and storage, 
numerical analysis shows that our schemes have achieved the best results among all the efforts to 
reduce the transmission costs.

The notion of broadcast encryption was first introduced by Berkovits [17] in 1991 using 
polynomial interpolation and secret sharing. Then, in 1993, Fiat and Noar [18] presented a formal 
definition of broadcast encryption and proposed a scheme that can resist the collusion of users up 
to a predetermined threshold. Later, Naor et al. [19] suggested an important subset-cover 
framework and presented two well-known schemes: CS (Complete Subtree scheme) and SD 
(Subset Difference scheme). Both schemes are symmetric-key setting and adopt a tree hierarchy 
where each user is associated with a leaf node. Besides, the two schemes are secure in the sense 
that no coalition of excluded users can derive unauthorized keys to decrypt messages. In 
particular, SD has caught the most attention among all the broadcast encryption schemes in the 
literature. For a system of n users, its transmission overhead (TO) for the center is only O(r), 
where r is the number of revoked users. Furthermore, the storage size requirement (SS) and 
computational cost (CC) for users are merely 2(log )O n  and (log )O n , respectively. Due to its 
excellent performances, SD has been adopted by Blu-ray Disc in the AACS (Advanced Access 
Content System) [5] for digital right protection. Later, based on SD, Halevi and Shamir [20] 
exploited the concept of layer and suggested the LSD scheme (Layered SD) to improve the 
storage size requirement (SS) to 1(log )O n . The expense is additional transmission cost. 
Goodrich et al. [21] proposed the SSD (Stratified SD) scheme to reduce the storage requirement 
to (log )O n . Likewise, the price is larger transmission and computational cost. For more 
schemes in the literature, the readers may refer to, e.g., [22]-[26].  
 
Besides, there are also interests toward shortening the transmission overheads (TO), while 
keeping SS and CC practical. This is crucial in applying broadcast encryption to large systems 
such as pay-TV, where the number of revoked users may accumulate to, say, one million or even 
more. For example, according to [19], [30], the worst-case TO for SD is 2r-1 for small r, and the 
ratio TO(worst case)/r will decrease slightly as r grow, until TO(worst case)/r = 0.5 when 50% users are 
revoked. Obviously, the transmission overhead is too huge. For the public-setting schemes 
[26]-[28], despite the various tradeoffs among TO, SS, and CC, a common weakness is the high 
CC when applied to large systems like pay-TV. Furthermore, with so many users, the 
computational complexity of the center is awful.  
 
Recently, Cheon et al. proposed skipping, cascade, and combined chain schemes [29] in the 
symmetric-key setting. Unlike the tree-based schemes mentioned above, these schemes arrange 
the users into a line. Compared with SD scheme, the schemes can achieve better TO when the 
number of revoked users is very high. However, high CC is still the shortcoming of these 
schemes. In this paper, we propose a symmetric-key-setting broadcast encryption scheme called 
BDSD and its variant BDSDλ. BDSD and BDSDλ are extensions of SD. By enlarging the subset 
collection of SD with some special subsets, our schemes keep the excellent computational 
performance of SD, while providing better TO. Moreover, the BDSDλ scheme has the capability 
of tradeoff between TO and SS. Considering the price of computation and storage, numerical
