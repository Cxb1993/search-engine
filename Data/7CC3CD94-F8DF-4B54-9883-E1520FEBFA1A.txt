英文摘要 
In this project, we will investigate the 
influence of the self-aligned nano-MOSFET 
technology on the CMOS scaling, I/T 
DRAM,combined applications of tunneling 
mechanism and vertical Tri-Gate MOSFET’s 
SDRAM, and the room temperature single 
electron transistor. Moreover, the device 
fabrication and the electrical characteristics of 
proposed device structures are also carried out. 
    (1) Self-aligned nano-MOSFETs: In order 
to overcome the short-channel effects (SCEs), 
several non-classical MOSFETs are proposed. 
And, both the self-heating and floating body 
effects are also suppressed due to the presence of 
the body-tied or source/drain-tied scheme in our 
proposed device structures without using 
extremely ultra-thin silicon source/drain and 
channel. 
    (2) Research of Self-aligned I/T DRAM: 
For the consideration of bulk band-to-band 
tunneling leakage curent (Ib-btbt), we propose a 
block oxide and self-aligned based 1/T DRAM 
technology for achieving high density 
applications 
(3) Novel Self-aligned SONOS Memory 
Technology: For high density and high 
performance applications, we demonstrate a 
self-aligned block oxide SONOS technology to 
ameliorate the leakage current and reach a 
multi-bit level. Hence, the device scaling can be 
achieved. 
(4) Combined applications of Tunneling 
Mechanism and Vertical Tri-Gate MOSFET’s 
SDRAM: Two NDR characteristics and SDRAM 
behavior in a vertical Tri-Gate MOSFET are 
shown in our project. Additionally, owing to the 
vertical gate scheme, the memory capacity and 
the speed can be improved. 
(5) Room Temperature Single Electron 
Transistor: In this project, we utilize the 
self-aligned spacer technology to propose three 
types of SETs in order to achieve a low-power

function of HBO [15]. 
 
Fig. 2.4: The waveforms of the bPDSOI and 
PDSOI with raised S/D structures during the 
operations [15]. 
According to the experimental and 
simulation results, the impact of HBO on the 
electrical characteristics is one of the important 
parameters in the design of block oxide based 
I/T DRAM. The height of BO must be high 
enough to enlarge the kink phenomenon. Also 
due to this block oxide, our proposed device 
structure shows about 87% higher programming 
window than its counterpart. In order words, the 
disadvantage of low programming window in a 
conventional PDSOI MOSFET can be 
eliminated in our proposed novel I/T DRAM. 
 
3. Novel Self-aligned SONOS Memory 
Technology 
In this part, we investigate the misaligned 
process for fluctuations of threshold voltage, 
DIBL, GM, and thermal behavior. Therefore, 
we can prove that the novel SONOS memory 
technology must be based on self-alignment. 
Otherwise, the electrical properties of device 
cannot be accepted. In order words, the further 
scaled SONOS devices must fully be 
self-aligned in order to achieve specific 
applications. 
The simulation results are shown in Figs. 
3.1-3.4. 
 
Fig. 3.1: Vth as a function of gate shift [16]. 
 
Fig. 3.2: DIBL as a function of gate shift [16]. 
  
Fig. 4.5: Threshold voltage as a function of gate 
length [17]. 
Fig. 4.2: Lattice temperature profiles of four 
types of vertical transistors [17]. 
It is observed that our proposed vertical 
Tri-gate not only obtains the best short-channel 
control, but also shows excellent thermal 
stability. The first one is that the Tri-gate scheme 
helps to reduce the encroachment of drain 
electric field, resulting in reduced DIBL and 
better threshold voltage roll-off. The second one 
is that the S/D tie is one of the good solutions for 
suppressing the self-heating effects. Hence, both 
undesired effects are alleviated, which suggests 
that our proposed vertical Tri-gate can be a 
candidate for SDRAM applications. 
 
     
5. Single Electron Transistor 
In this project, we demonstrate three types 
of SETs based on different device fabrication 
processes (1. hard mask, 2. self-aligned 
source/drain, and 3. gate electrode) to investigate 
the electrical properties:

of vertical transistors [17].

Moreover, same important patents have been 
obtained based on our study and works.
