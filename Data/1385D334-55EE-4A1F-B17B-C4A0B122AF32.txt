響分析，本研究設計與製作了三種不同規格的繞射元件，分別可產生不同的贋無繞射光束 
[2-4]，並分析不同的傾斜角對於光學特性的影響。 
二、研究方法 
    本次繞射元件的設計參數如下：繞射光學元件的有效孔徑與入射的平面波直徑均為
12.0 mm，輸入平面的取樣點為 1200，繞射元件 1、繞射元件 2與繞射元件 3在光軸上分別
對應的贋無繞射光數區段為 [140 mm, 200 mm]、[280 mm, 340 mm]與[420 mm, 480 mm]。 
圖一所示為所設計八階量化繞射元件的徑向表面輪廓分布圖。 如圖二所示，黑色曲線所示
為傾斜角為 0的繞射元件，其所對應的軸向光強度分布。此軸向光強度分布曲線位於 [140 
mm, 200 mm] 區段幾乎呈現均勻分布。當繞射元件 1 向光軸傾斜一個角度，在相對應的贋
無繞射區域的光強度分布將會產生波動，且其強度值也小於無傾斜角時的相對應強度值。
圖二所示為繞射元件在傾斜角為 0˚~5˚時所對應的軸向光強度分布曲線圖，如圖所示，繞
射元件 1 所產生的贋無繞射區段之光強度值變化量，繞射元件在大角度傾斜時的變化量比
小角度傾斜時來得劇烈，而且在位於相同軸向座標位置，其光強度值也比較小。比較各光
軸位置的光強度變化情形，發現位於光軸 178.5 mm 的位置，其光強度隨著傾斜角改變具
有最小的波動，其變化量約 3.6%。圖三所示為所設計八階繞射元件 2的徑向表面輪廓深度
分布圖。與繞射元件 1 的比較，繞射元件 2 的焦距比繞射元件 1 長，繞射元件 2 在光軸上
所產生的光強度分布如圖四所示，比較各光軸位置的光強度變化情形，發現位於光軸 
330.7mm 的位置，其光強度隨著傾斜角改變具有最小的波動，其變化量約 17.8%。比較繞
射元件 1 與繞射元件 2 的計算結果，繞射元件 2 的軸向光強度的均勻性對於傾斜角的變化
具有較高的忍受度。圖五所示為所設計八階繞射元件 3 的徑向表面輪廓深度分布圖，圖六
所示為繞射元件 3 所產生的軸向光強度分布圖，比較各光軸位置的光強度變化情形，發現
位於光軸 463.6mm 的位置，其光強度隨著傾斜角改變具有最小的波動，其變化量約 14.3%。
比較前三種規格的繞射光學元件的特性發現，繞射元件 3具有最佳的傾斜角誤差容忍度。 
我們利用接觸式表面微影技術與反應離子蝕刻製程，在一塊石英基板上製作出所須繞射
元件的表面輪廓，其製作的最小線寬為 10 m，圖七所示為製作完成的八階繞射元件的照

三、結果與討論 
 本計劃中，我們設計與製作了三種不同的繞射光學元件，並分析其不同傾斜角所產生
的光學特性影響，較大的傾斜角將帶來較大的軸向強度值的波動，並降低軸向光強度的均
勻性。此外，具有較長焦距的繞射元件，其對應的軸向贋無繞射光束的均勻性將對傾斜角
誤差較不敏感。在此研究的過程中，我們也發現當傾斜角產生變化時，在光軸上某個特定
位置，其光強度變化幅度可達最小。

Abstract We design three types of diffractive optical ele-
ments (DOEs) which generate pseudo-nondiffracting beams
(PNDBs) in different regions by using the conjugate gra-
dient method. In order to analyze the influence of the tilt
angles of the DOEs, the coordinate-transformation method
is used to simplify the calculation. The uniformity of the
out-coupling illuminance along the optical axis is calcu-
lated. The analyzed results show that when the tilt angle in-
creases, the uniformity in the region [140 mm, 200 mm] has
more violent fluctuations than those in the regions [280 mm,
340 mm] and [380 mm, 520 mm]. The analyses also reveal
that the uniformity of DOEs with a longer focal length is less
sensitive to the tilt angle, and some points within the PNDB
region have small variations of axial illuminance while the
tilt angle increases.
1 Introduction
Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are optical elements
which can flexibly control the wavefront of incident light
to perform diverse functions. The advantages of multifunc-
tion, light weight, and thin thickness allow designers’ ideas
to be realized in many laser applications, including beam

shaper [1], intra-cavity mode-selector [2], optical intercon-
nection [3], wavelength separation [4, 5], and display [6].
So far, most DOEs have been applied to the construction of
various transverse images. However, axial intensity modu-
lation is also important and required in many applications:
multifocal optical elements in laser optical disk heads, uni-
form intensity axicons in precise alignment and profile mea-
surement, and so on. Recently, the design and fabrication of
the DOEs which achieve various axial-intensity modulations
along the optical axis have been proposed.
DOEs which produce nearly nondiffracting beams have
also been demonstrated in the previous literature. The non-
diffracting beam with amplitude described by a zero-order
Bessel function of the first kind was introduced in 1987 [7],
and it has attracted great interest because of its possible
applications in optical alignment, surveying, industrial in-
spection, and optical interconnection. Lately, the concept
of a pseudo-nondiffracting beam (PNDB) [8–10], charac-
terized by almost constant axial illuminance distribution
over a finite region and a beamlike shape in the transverse
dimension, has also been proposed. A PNDB must have
field amplitude near the transverse Bessel beam distribution.
A PNDB possesses unique properties, such as uniform axial
illuminance, narrow lateral distribution, and a long propa-
gation distance along the optical axis. Recently, the PNDB
has been applied to material ablation, which has the advan-
tages of larger depth and smaller taper in the material re-
moval processes [11, 12].
DOEs can realize many desired optical functions along
the optical axis by using the phase modulation of incident
beams. The phase modulation can be realized by sculptur-
ing the DOE surface profile and varying the optical path dif-
ferences. If the optical path difference deviates from the de-
sired design, the axial light field will be changed. Especially,
when the DOE encounters unwanted tilt during the packag-

(x, y, z) to a new coordinate system (x′, y′, z′) that makes
the tilted DOE parallel to the (x, y) plane. After transfer-
ring to a new coordinate system, the incident light tilts at
an angle θ with respect to the z axis and denoted as k′. The
transformation is given as follows:
⎧⎪⎨
⎪⎩
x2 = (z2 − z1) tan θ + x′2 cos θ,
y2 = y′2,
z2 = (z2 − z1) tan θ − x′2 sin θ.

To fully exploit the circular symmetry of the new coordinate
system, we make a transformation to polar coordinates in
the (x′, y′) plane. Applying the coordinate transformations
(6) to (1), the output field of the tilted DOE can be rewritten
as

2.2 Calculated results
The parameters used in this design are described as fol-
lows. The diameters of the DOEs and the incident plane-
wave beam are assumed as 12.0 mm. The number of sam-
pling points on the input plane is 1200. DOE1, DOE2, and
DOE3 have corresponding PNDB segments in the regions
[140 mm, 200 mm], [280 mm, 340 mm], and [420 mm,
480 mm] along the optical axis, respectively. The black solid
line in Fig. 2 represents the calculated results of the ideal
DOE1 with 0 = 0°. It shows that the axial illuminance in the
region [140 mm, 200 mm] is almost uniform. When DOE1
tilts, i.e., θ = 0°, the axial illuminance in the correspond-
ing region fluctuates with the peak values always less than
the ideal one. Figure 2 shows the comparison of DOE1 with
various tilt angles θ ranging from 0° ∼ 5°. As shown in this
figure, the fluctuation amplitude of the PNDB of DOE1 with

to those at other positions within the PNDB region

of the tilt angle of DOE3. The curve is a cubic polynomial of the tilt
angle
DOE2 with a tilt angle of 0, 3.0, and 5.0 degrees, respec-
tively. As shown in Fig. 7, the curve of VRMS is a cubic
polynomial of the tilt angle. This curve for DOE2 has the
same tendencies as that for DOE1, but the gradients are dif-
ferent. A comparison of the results from DOE1 and DOE2
shows that the VRMS of DOE1 increases more rapidly than
that of DOE2; i.e., the illuminance uniformity of DOE2 is
less influenced by the tilt angle. Figure 8 shows the axial
illuminance distributions of DOE3 with the longest focal
length. The axial illuminance has the minimum variation
(about 14.3%) at the axial coordinate of 463.6 mm, com-
pared to those at other positions within the PNDB region.
Figures 9(a), (b), and (c) show the illuminance distributions
of the (y′2, z′2) planes of DOE3 with a tilt angle of 0, 4.5, and
6.5 degrees, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10, the curve of
VRMS is a cubic polynomial of the tilt angle. This curve for
DOE3 has the same tendencies as that for DOE2, but the gra-
dients are different. A comparison of the results from DOE2
and DOE3 shows that the VRMS of DOE2 increases more
rapidly than that of DOE3; i.e., the illuminance uniformity
of DOE3 is less influenced by the tilt angle.
3 Conclusion
In conclusion, the coordinate-transformation method is used
to simplify the calculation of optical field on oblique in-
cidence. Three types of DOEs have been designed as il-
lustrations. The uniformity of the axial intensity of every
DOE is calculated and compared with the others. The larger
tilt angle of the DOE causes larger illuminance vibrations,
evaluated by the value of VRMS in this article and inferring
the lower uniformity of axial illuminance. A DOE with a
longer focal length is less sensitive to the tilt angle. More-
over, at a given coordinate, a larger tilt angle of a DOE
causes a smaller axial illuminance. From the analyzed re-
sults, the relationship between VRMS and the tilt angle is a
cubic polynomial function. Additionally, the minimum illu-
minance vibrations always occur at the same position within
the PNDB region when the tilt angle of an individual DOE
varies.
