mechanisms not only offer better fairness but also improves
transmission efficiency as compared to EDCA and EEDCF.
The organization of the remaining paper is arranged as
follows. Section II details the design of the proposed mech-
anisms. Then, numerical examples and discussions are given
in Section III. Finally, Section IV concludes the paper.
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED MECHANISMS
A. Design of EDDRR-BI
Similar to DDRR [13], the deficit count plays an important
role in scheduling for EDDRR-BI in which three types of
deficit counts rather than one type of the deficit count as in
DDRR are defined for three access categories, including audio,
video, and data (here, the access category of background is
not included). In the following, a dummy variable l is used
to denote the type of access categories (service classes), for
example, l = a denotes audio, l = v denotes video, and
l = d denotes data. For the ith flow of access category
l in station j at time t, DCjl,i(t) is defined to denote the
corresponding deficit count. When no data is transmitted,
DCjl,i(t) accumulates according to the following relationship:
DCjl,i(t) = DC
j
l,i(t
′) +Kjl,i × (t− t′), l = a, v, d, (1)
where t′ is a time instant ahead of t, i.e., t′ ≤ t, and Kjl,i
denotes the desired throughput for the ith flow of access
category l in station j. One may further note that the definition
of the deficit count in (1) differs from the deficit count in [13]
as follows: only the desired throughput Kjl,i is used in this
paper, while a fixed quantum Q and a variable time interval T
are required for DDRR. Hence, it is easier in parameter setting
using Kjl,i than Q and T . From (1), one can easily understand
that a deficit count accumulates linearly as time goes and is
proportional to the desired throughput. When a frame for the
ith flow of access category l in station j is transmitted at time
t, the frame size is then deducted from the deficit count, i.e.,
DCjl,i(t) = DC
j
l,i(t)− F ls(t), l = a, v, d, (2)
where F ls(t) denotes the corresponding frame size for access
category l transmitted at time t. In the following, we further
relate the deficit count to the backoff interval. The following
equation defines a temporary backoff interval TBID,jl,i (t) (l =
a, v, d) for the ith flow of access category l in station j at time
t, where D is used to explicitly denote EDDRR-BI.
TBID,jl,i (t) = CW
l
max − φDl DCjl,i(t), l = a, v, d, (3)
where CW lmax is the maximum window size for access
category l, φDl is used to let the resultant TBI
D,j
l,i (t) can fall
within the specification of inter frame space (IFS) by IEEE
802.11e. According to the QoS requirement defined in the
IEEE 802.11e standard, CW lmax for access category l has a
different value so that differentiated QoS can be provided, i.e.,
CW amax = 2
4−1, CW vmax = 25−1, CW dmax = 210−1. From
(3), one notes: i) Audio has a more chance to have a shorter
backoff interval than video which has a more chance to have
a shorter backoff interval than data under a fixed deficit count
because different values of the maximum window size are set
to different access categories; ii) For a access category with a
lower priority, its deficit count gets larger as time goes and then
may have a shorter corresponding backoff interval than access
categories with higher priorities. The first statement says that
the QoS requirement of IEEE 802.11e is preserved and the
second statement makes sure that no starvation occurs using
EDDRR-BI. Finally, taking the cross-layer design principle
into account enables us to use the temporary backoff interval
previously defined and the collision rate c to determine the
backoff interval BID,jl,i (t) for the ith flow of access category
l in station j at time t (again, D is used to explicitly denote
EDDRR-BI) via
BID,jl,i (t) = max(0.2, 1− c)TBID,jl,i (t), l = a, v, d. (4)
Because max(0.2, 1 − c) = 1 − c when 0 ≤ c ≤ 0.8
and max(0.2, 1 − c) = 0.2 when 0.8 < c ≤ 1, it makes
BID,jl,i (t) shorter (with a minimum value of 0.2TBID,jl,i (t))
than TBID,jl,i (t) when the collision rate gets higher. Hence, the
backoff interval determined by (4) is able to alleviate collision.
Of course, the adjustment of the backoff interval caused by a
collision is still rendered from the IEEE 802.11e standard [7].
Before the description of the EDERR-BI mechanism, let us
summarize the nature of EDDRR-BI as follows:
• The deficit count defined in (1) and (2) is responsible for
scheduling so that better fairness can be retained.
• The temporary backoff interval in (3) not only considers
the scheduling principle but also preserves the QoS
requirement for access categories defined in the IEEE
802.11e standard.
• Finally, the backoff interval in (4) further combines the
previous characteristics and the cross-layer design idea
to reach fair scheduling and performance improvement
in the QoS-oriented environment.
B. Design of EDERR-BI
Unlike EDDRR-BI, EDERR-BI adopts allowance which
is an elastic and adjustable amount of traffic data allowed
for transmission [6] to govern the kernel of scheduling.
Traffic data is allowed to be consecutively transmitted until
the amount of traffic data is a bit more than the specified
allowance. Again, three types of allowance are needed for the
three access categories and the definition of allowance for the
ith flow of access category l in station j at time t Aja,i(t) is
given by
Ajl,i(t) = K
j
l,i × (t− t′)− Ejl,i(t′), l = a, v, d, (5)
where Ejl,i(t′) stands for the excess amount for the ith flow
of access category l in station j at time t′, namely,
Ejl,i(t
′) = F jl,i(t
′)−Ajl,i(t′), l = a, v, d, (6)
where F t,jl,i (t′) is the total amount of traffic data transmitted
at time t′ by the ith flow of access category l in station j.
Obviously, i) allowance in (5) is defined in proportional to the
desired throughput (this fairly allots allowance according to

B. Performance Metrics
To gauge the performance of different mechanisms, in-
cluding EDDRR-BI, EDERR-BI, EDCA, and EEDCF, the
following metrics are used: 1) throughput, 2) delay, 3) col-
lision rate, 4) standard deviation for throughput-to-weight
ratios, which can reflect the degree of fairness using the
reciprocal of this standard deviation. Of course, fairness
can also be reflected by the closeness of fairness index,
namely, (
∑
f
Sf
wf
)2/
∑
f
∑
f (
Sf
wf
)2 to 1 (the fairness of the
ideal/perfect case), where Sf and wf represent throughput
and weight, respectively of flow (station) f [6]. Hence, the
reciprocal of difference of fairness indices with respect to the
ideal case, i.e., 1/(1 − fairness index), can also be used to
represent the degree of fairness in the following.
C. Simulation Results
Let us now show QoS-related performance, including
throughput, delay, and collision rate, and degree of fairness
for the above-mentioned four mechanisms.
1) Throughput comparison: From Fig. 2, the following obser-
vations are made: i) All mechanisms have the same throughput
for audio because of its highest priority. ii) Throughput of
video starts to decrease for EDCA and EEDCF as the number
of stations increases to 15, while it maintains at the same
level, i.e., 128 KB/s, for EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI. Fixing
the number of stations at 18, we have 8% and 1.5% of
improvement for both EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI compared
to EDCA and EEDCF, respectively. iii) As the number of
stations increases to 9, throughput of data starts to decrease
notably for all mechanisms. When the number of stations is
18, we have 14% and 41% (28% and 58%) of improvement
for EDDRR-BI (EDERR-BI) compared to EDCA and EEDCF,
respectively. Obviously, throughput of data for EEDCF is even
lower than that of EDCA. Based on the above observations,
we demonstrate that EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI can provide
better throughput for all access categories than EDCA, while
EEDCF may make throughput for data worse than EDCA. Of
course, EDERR-BI performs a bit better than EDDRR-BI.
2) Delay comparison: The result is shown in Fig. 3. Because
the highest priority is set to audio, all mean delays for audio
are zero. For mean delays of video, they increase approxi-
mately in a linear trend. When the number of stations is 18,

mean delay for EDCA (EEDCF) is 84% and 126% (17% and
44%) higher than EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI, respectively.
For data, mean delays increase sharply when the number of
stations is beyond 9. Observing results for 18 stations, mean
delay for EDCA (EEDCF) is 5% and 8% (9% and 12%) higher
than EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI, respectively. Hence, similar
concluding remarks like those in throughput can be made.
3) Collision rate comparison: Using results shown in Fig. 4
when the number of stations is 18, we have 22% of improve-
ment for EDDRR-BI and 31% of improvement for EDERR-BI
compared to EDCA. And results for EEDCF, EDDRR-BI, and
EDERR-BI are comparable.
4) Fairness comparison: Fig. 5 (Fig. 6) shows throughput-to-
weight ratios among different access categories (for stations).
From Fig. 5 (Fig. 6), we have 120% and 7% (97% and 19%) of
improvement for EDDRR-BI and 144% and 33% (230% and
98%) of improvement for EDERR-BI compared to EDCA and
EEDCF, respectively, when concerning the fairness for flows
(stations). In Fig. 7, flow-level and station-level differences
of fairness indices with respect to the ideal case are shown.
Fig. 7(a) (Fig. 7(b)) indicates that 50% and 6% (77% and
18%) of improvement for EDDRR-BI and 100% and 41%
(192% and 94%) of improvement for EDERR-BI compared to
EDCA and EEDCF, respectively, when concerning the fairness
for flows (stations) are obtained. Therefore, the two ways to
represent the degree of fairness consistently show that the
order of fairness from the best to the worst is EDERR-BI,
EDDRR-BI, EEDCF, EDCA.

Abstract— Two scheduling mechanisms called enhanced dis-
tributed deficit round robin with backoff interval (EDDRR-
BI) and enhanced distributed elastic round robin with backoff
interval (EDERR-BI) are proposed in this paper for the IEEE
802.11e wireless LAN. EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI take both
priority which is a mean to guarantee quality of service (QoS)
and fairness simultaneously into account so that QoS and
fairness can be well taken care. The idea behind the proposed
mechanisms mainly relies on dynamic adjustment of the backoff
interval according to priority, collision rate, and deficit count or
allowance. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that
the proposed mechanisms can reach station-level fairness as well
as flow-level fairness within the same (among different) access
category (categories). Of course, these mechanisms outperform
the related schemes in the literature.
I. INTRODUCTION
Affordable cost and convenience of mobile devices, e.g.,
personal digital assistant (PDA) and laptop etc., and related
wireless technologies have pushed rapid development of wire-
less local area networks (LANs). With maturity of the wire-
less LAN standards, e.g., IEEE 802.11 series, technologies,
and devices, some famous cities, for example, Philadelphia,
Cleveland, and Taipei, have deployed intensive wireless LANs
in metropolitan areas to reach high accessibility of wire-
less in the city. To further satisfy users’ needs, diverse and
multimedia applications should be supported. This leads to
that many papers in the literature have focused on the issue
of how to achieve QoS requirements in wireless multimedia
networks, e.g., [1], [5]. Since IEEE 802.11, 802.11b, and
802.11a standards do not define QoS and their medium access
control (MAC) layers composed of distributed coordination
function (DCF) and point coordination function (PCF) have
some drawbacks (see [2] for details), IEEE 802.11 task group
E modified DCF to support multimedia transmission in IEEE
802.11 wireless LANs. The enhanced DCF is then called
EDCF or EDCA [7], which strengthens some functions of
DCF, including defining multiple queues of different priorities
to take care of different QoS requirements. To further touch
the QoS-related issue in the IEEE 802.11e-based network,
Romdhani et al. [14] proposed a dynamic minimum contention
window adjustment according to needs of applications and
network status so that the collision rate can be reduced and
the medium utilization can be increased. In [16], Vinnakote
et al. adjusted the length of the arbitrary inter frame space
(AIFS) and the size of contention window to shorten delay.
And Mangold [12] proposed a priority-based mechanism to
assign bandwidth according to different traffic categories. In
this paper, we also focus on the QoS-oriented IEEE 802.11e-
based wireless LAN on which two fair scheduling mechanisms
are designed.
Let us now review the status of scheduling. In the literature,
many scheduling algorithms for both wired and wireless
networks have been studied, e.g., [4], [8], [9]. As for fair
scheduling for wireless LANs, related papers include dis-
tributed fair scheduling (DFS) [15], distributed weighted fair
queuing (DWFQ) [3], adaptive fair enhanced DCF (AFEDCF)
[11], distributed deficit round robin (DDRR) [13], distributed
elastic round robin (DERR) [6], and enhanced EDCF (EEDCF)
[10]. DFS [15] achieves fairness through adjusting the backoff
interval, while DWFQ [3] and AFEDCF [11] adjust the
contention window to provide fairness. Using a mapping
function of the inter frame space (IFS), DDRR [13] and
DERR [6] involve no backoff and achieve fairness by suitably
controlling deficit count and allowance, respectively. In [6],
Ferng et al. shows that DERR outperforms DDRR. Because
of hard implementation for DERR, EEDCF [10] incorporates
the allowance concept into the backoff interval adjustment and
uses different values of weights to set different priorities to
offer differentiated services. In this paper, we also propose two
new fair scheduling mechanisms with cross-layer considera-
tion (channel condition and QoS belonging to different layers
are simultaneously considered), which are designed based on
concepts of deficit count and allowance. Unlike DDRR and
DERR, the two proposed mechanisms allow backoff to ease
implementation. Moreover, multiple types of deficit count and
allowance are defined for EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI, while
only a single type of deficit count and allowance is used in
DDRR and DERR. This eases QoS handling for EDDRR-BI
and EDERR-BI to make them suit the IEEE 802.11e LAN.
Last but not least, reasonable definitions of weights are defined
for EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI and they are directly related to
parameter setting, i.e., the desired throughput. Except DDRR
and DERR, EEDCF is the most closest to our proposed
mechanisms in the literature. However, EEDCF must manually
sets larger values of weights following the order of voice
(audio), video, best effort (data) to keep the same order
for the priority setting. This provides an indirect way to
handle QoS requirements and may not be reasonable. Via
numerical experiments, we finally show that the two proposed
1550-2252/$25.00 ©2007 IEEE  840
demands); ii) allowance increases linearly as time goes (this
avoids starvation for low-priority access categories); iii) the
excess amount at the latest time instant should be deducted to
enforce fair scheduling. In [6], allowance is defined using a
fixed quantum Q and a variable time interval T like DDRR
[13] rather than Kjl,i, i.e., the desired throughput, therefore,
operation and parameter setting are somewhat indirect. To
comply with the QoS requirement and MAC operation in
the IEEE 802.11e LAN necessitates a relationship between
the allowance and the temporary backoff interval like that in
EDDRR-BI. The temporary backoff interval follows
TBIE,jl,i (t) = CW
l
max − φEl Ajl,i(t), l = a, v, d, (7)
where E is used to explicitly represent EDERR–BI and the
goal of φEl is to let TBI
E,j
l,i (t) fall within a suitable range
according to the IEEE 802.11e standard. Applying the same
design principle in (4) using TBIE,jl,i (t) and information of
collision rate c allows us to have the backoff interval BIE,jl,i (t)
shown below for the ith flow of access category l in station j
at time t.
BIE,jl,i (t) = max(0.2, 1− c)TBIE,jl,i (t), l = a, v, d. (8)
Hence, the determination of backoff interval in (8) simultane-
ously includes concepts of fair scheduling, QoS requirement,
and performance improvement.
C. Definitions of Weights
For both EDDRR-BI and EDERR-BI, weights should be
properly defined so that one can gauge fairness based on
weights. Here, we define weights for flows within the same
access category l (l = a, v, d) w[s],jl,i ([s] is used to denote
the same access category), weights for flows among different
access categories w[d],jl,i ([d] is used to stand for different access
categories), and weights for different stations wj so that flow-
level and station-level fairness can be defined. Now, the three
types of weights are defined as follows:
w
[s],j
l,i =
Kjl,i
∑

∑
i K
j
l,i
∑
l
∑
j
∑
i K

l,i
. (11)
The reason why values of the desired throughput are used
to define weights in (9) is explained as follows. Note that
one may use the reciprocal of the standard deviation for
throughput-to-weight ratios to stand for the degree of fairness
[6]. Hence, weights should be proportional to the (desired)
throughput. Note that no direct and reasonable definitions
of weights are given in [10] compared to definitions here.
Certainly, no station-level fairness was associated with EEDCF
[10]. Note that weights for all mechanisms in the following
simulation experiments follow the aforementioned definitions.

III. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND DISCUSSIONS
Let us now study performance and fairness for different
mechanisms using the simulation approach. First, simulation
arrangements are detailed. Then, performance metrics and
simulation results along with discussions are provided.
A. Simulation Arrangements
We use the well-know network simulator ns-2 [17] as
the simulation platform. The topology considered is a star
topology shown in Fig. 1 with a central station, denoted
by STA 0, and n surrounding stations, denoted by STA i,
i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Each station contains audio, video, and data
flows, respectively. For the three access categories, related
general parameters are given in Table I. For simulations to get
throughput, delay, and collision rate, the desired flow rates
(desired throughput) for audio, video, and data are fixed at
8 KB/s, 128 KB/s, and 120 KB/s, respectively. But for the
simulation to get the degree of fairness, three stations are put
into one group in which different flow rates are set to the three
videos (data), while the same rate (8 KB/s) is set to all audio.
To have more stations, we add more such identical groups. As
for the wireless LAN standards, IEEE 802.11a and 802.11e
are employed under transmission rate of 36 Mbps. In Table II,
some important parameters for the MAC are listed, including
the length of a slot time etc. In general, each simulation run
is observed for at least 100 seconds to collect performance
metrics. In the next subsection, the performance metrics used
are defined.
