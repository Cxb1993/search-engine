1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Meditation nowadays is widely acknowledged as one important technique in the 
category of mind-body medicine after having been proved to benefit human health and 
wellness in various aspects via the extensive, profound researches since 1960s and Meditation 
is described as a wakeful hypometabolic state of parasympathetic dominance that has been 
corroborated by such physiological indicators as the reduction of heart rate, blood pressure, 
and respiratory rate, significant increase in plasma melatonin levels and better regulation of 
cortisol level. As CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) becomes more popular in 
the West. Among a large variety of approaches in CAM, meditation has been one of the most 
widely acceptable practices due to its substantial effectiveness and safety. However, except 
for RSA phenomenon, very few researches are performed to study the synchronization and 
nonlinear coupling of cardiorespiratory systems during meditation. This study was aimed to 
investigate the phase synchronization and nonlinear coupling while cardiorespiratory 
interaction occurred during Chan meditation. Among various meditation techniques, Chan 
meditation originating from Dharma-Chan reveals an extraordinarily unique way of practicing 
meditation via “holy-heart unification” enlightenment. Our previous study on EEG 
(electroencephalograph) has revealed some exclusive characteristics of a Chan-enlightened 
brain.  
The interaction between human cardiac and respiratory systems has been widely studied 
for many decades. It has been found that these two systems do not act independently; instead, 
they are coupled by some mechanisms. In addition to RSA (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) [1], 
other cardiorespiratory interaction such as synchronization has been observed, and the nature 
of interaction like nonlinear coupling was proposed in recent years [2-5].   
In 1998, Schäfer et al. [2] applied the concept of phase synchronization of chaotic 
oscillators [6] to the development of a technique called ‘synchrogram’ to analyze irregular, 
non-stationary bivariate data. Afterward several researches followed the synchrogram method 
and presented the phenomenon of cardiorespiratory phase synchronization on different 
subjects. Duration and frequency ratio are parameters of phase synchronization that have ever 
been investigated in these researches. Cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CPRS) is a 
recently investigated phenomenon reflecting certain type of interaction between cardiac and

phase difference. Note that the values of 1φ  and 2φ  are not bounded in [0, 2π ]. 
Follow the basic work of Stratonovich [8], phase locking in noisy systems is understood 
as the appearance of a peak in the distribution of the cyclic relative phase n,mΨ , and can be 
interpreted as the existence of a dominated stable value of phase difference between the two 
oscillators. 
(2.2) 
 
where ‘mod’ is an operator converting the value of n,mϕ  into the range [0, π2 ] by subtracting 
πk2 (k is an integer) such that πn,m 2Ψ0 <≤ . 
 
2.1.2 Instantaneous Phase 
The instantaneous phase at any time t can be derived by the linear interpolation equation 
below, 
 
(2.3) 
 
where kt  is the time of the k
th marker event [9]. The instantaneous phase of kth marker event 
is πk2 . 
 
2.1.3 Synchrogram Method and Quantification 
 
The synchrogram method [4] was used to analyze the phase synchronization of two 
interacting self-oscillatory systems. As described in equation (2.4), )(
2km
tψ  is obtained by 
wrapped phase 1φ  modulo mπ2 , and is observed at time 2kt  when the marker events of 
oscillator 2 occur. Then the values of )(
2km
tψ  at time 2kt  are marked by dots along the 
vertical axis and the synchrogram is completed.

The experimental procedure of this study is illustrated in Fig. 3.1. Because the human 
cardiac function can be regulated by autonomic nervous system (ANS), the experiments were 
conducted during the same period (3:00pm to 5:00pm) to ensure the approximately same state 
of ANS of all subjects. The experiments comprised two sessions. During Session 1, subjects 
of both groups rested, in a ~70? head-up back-tilt position with eyes closed, for 10 minutes. 
During Session 2, subjects of control group continued resting for 20 minutes; on the other 
hand, experimental subjects began meditation for 20 minutes. Experimental subjects, 
following their routine meditation habit, meditated with either full-lotus or half-lotus posture, 
with eyes closed.  
 Fig. 3.1 Experimental procedure. 
 
ECG and respiratory signals were measured using PowerLab biosignal recording system (ADInstruments, 
Sydney, Australia) and then displayed and saved on a personal computer using the software Chart4 
(ADInstruments, Bella Vista, Australia). 
 
3.1.1 Measurement of ECG signal 
The ECG signal was recorded using Lead?of standard bipolar limb leads [12]. Electrode 
site on the left (right) arm was connected to the amplifier’s positive (negative) input, with the 
ground on the inside of left ankle. The disposable ECG electrodes (Medi-Trace 200 Foam 
Electrodes, Kendall, Chicopee, MA, USA) were applied in this study. The ECG was 
pre-filtered by a 0.3-200 Hz bandpass filter and digitized by a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. 
 
3.1.2 Measurement of Respiratory signal 
Respiratory signal was recorded using a piezo-electric transducer (Model 1132 
Pneumotrace II (R), UFI, Morro Bay, CA, USA), that was wrapped around the belly passing 
the navel. The respiratory signal was pre-filtered by a lowpass filter with cutoff frequency of 5 
Hz and digitized at the sampling rate of 1000 Hz.  
 
3.2 Strategies for Synchronization Analysis 
Step 1. Pre-processing 
Power spectrums of QRS complexes and respiratory signals are approximately 10-30 Hz 
and 0.2-0.3 Hz [13,14]. Accordingly, in pre-processing stage, we applied Matlab’s built-in 
polyphase filter implementation, including anti-aliasing (lowpass) FIR filter, to down-sample

Step 1. Pre-processing 
Fundamental frequencies of ECG and respiratory signals are approximately 1.2 Hz and 
0.3 Hz [13]. Accordingly, raw ECG and respiratory signals originally recorded with sampling 
rate of 1000 Hz were downsampled to 10 Hz using Matlab’s built-in polyphase filter 
implementation, including anti-aliasing, lowpass FIR filter with cutoff frequency 5 Hz. Then 
Chebyshev I IIR highpass filter with cutoff frequency 0.04 Hz was used to remove the 
baseline drift. 
Step 2. Estimate Cross-Bispectrum 
By equation (2.12), the cross-bispectrum ˆ ( , ,  )x y xB k l m  was estimated. Here, k  
represents the frequency of ECG signal, l  represents the frequency of respiratory signal, and 
m  represents the time. The length of time window was selected to be 10 times of the period 
of slower signal, i.e. respiratory signal, to get reliable FFT (fast Fourier Transform) result. The 
slowest frequency of respiratory signals in our study was about 0.2 Hz (period: 5 sec per 
breath). We thus selected the window length to be 1 minute. To observe the time-varying 
behavior in more details, the moving step was selected to be 1 second.  
Step 3. Calculate Biamplitude and Biphase at Bifrequency ( ef , rf ) 
Biamplitude and biphase were evaluated at bifrequency ( ef , rf ) for each window frame. 
The bifrequency ( ef , rf ) of each window was determined by the maximum-power 
frequencies of ECG and respiratory signals respectively.  
Step 4. Quantify the Coupling Degree 
The coupling degree is determined by 
   (3.1) 
 
where Anormalized (m) is the normalized biamplitude for a given window, that is derived by first 
dividing the biamplitude by total power of cross-bispectrum in 0≤ ef , rf ≤  fs/2 and then 
normalizing the results of all subjects to the range [0 1]. The )(mφγ , denoting the constant 
degree of biphase, can be calculated by equation (2.15) for a given window centered at time 
m. 
Step 5. Quantify the Coupling Length 
To quantify the coupling length, a threshold α  needs to be determined first. To 
determine an appropriate value of α , the following procedure was proposed: 
(1) A new sequence )(mean tλ  containing the results of moving average of )(mλ  was

4.1.1 Comparison of Lasting Length 
The definition of “lasting length” here is the duration of an epoch with synchronization 
degree higher than threshold. By statistical analysis for the mean values of lasting length of 
synchronization, both groups revealed no significant difference between two sessions, as 
shown in Table 4.1 and Fig. 4.1. This indicates that, in general, neither meditation nor rest 
could noticeably affect the lasting length of synchronization. 
 
4.1.2 Comparison of Number of Epochs 
The definition of “number of epochs” here is the amount of epochs with synchronization 
degree higher than threshold in a ten minutes time duration. As shown in Table 4.1, mean 
values of the number of synchronization epochs revealed insignificant difference between 
main session and pre-session in control group. As regards the experimental group, it increased 
considerably during meditation, in comparison with the mean number observed in the 
pre-session background recording. 
Further, we investigated the synchronization length for various (n/m) ratios. Fig. 4.2 
displays the average length of synchronization (in seconds) versus (n/m) ratio. According to 
Fig. 4.2 (a), significant increase in the length of synchronization was observed in 
experimental group at the ratio (n/m) = 4 (i.e., 4:1 synchronization) in the main-session 
recording, from which we may infer that one respiration accompanied four heart beats during 
the Chan-meditation course. On the other hand, the control group only revealed a slight 
increase at the ratio (n/m)=4.7 (i.e., 14:3 synchronization) in the (pre-session) background 
recording, without any particular event in the main-session recording (refer to Fig. 4.2 (b)).

4.2.1 Comparison of Lasting Length 
By statistical analysis for the mean values of lasting length of nonlinear coupling, both 
groups revealed no significant difference between two sessions in both groups, as shown in 
Table 4.2. This indicates that, in general, neither meditation nor rest could noticeably affect 
the lasting length of nonlinear coupling. 
 
4.2.2 Comparison of Number of Epochs 
As shown in Table 4.2, the mean values of the number of nonlinear coupling epochs 
revealed insignificant difference between main session and pre-session in control group. As 
regards the experimental group, it increased considerably during meditation, in comparison 
with the mean number observed in the pre-session background recording. 
 
4.2.3 Comparison of Total Length 
As shown in Table 4.2, the mean values of the total length of nonlinear coupling revealed 
insignificant difference between main session  and pre-session in both groups. 
 
4.3 Correlation between Phase Synchronization and Nonlinear Coupling 
To examine this hypothesis that the nonlinear coupling nature of cardiorespiratory system 
determined by time-phase cross-bispectral analysis could be correlated with cardiorespiratory 
phase synchronization in a sense, we conducted a quantitative analysis by calculating the 
correlation coefficients between them. We first interpolated the sequences (with 1 second 
resolution) for the instantaneous degree of both the phase synchronization and the nonlinear 
 16
5.2 Future Work 
In this study, we only investigated the coupling nature of characteristic frequencies of 
ECG and respiratory signals. The coupling caused by interaction of some other frequency 
components may play an important role in studying the physiological model under meditation. 
Besides, it has been reported in   the literatures that cardiorespiratory synchronization might 
be related to the central neural regulation [4] and brain activity [5]. Hence, for profound 
understanding of the Chan-meditation process and effects, EEG signals should be included to 
explore the mutual interaction between the brain and cardiorespiratory system.

Appendix A 
Formal Chan-meditation Practice 
 
    Formal Chan-meditation course normally begins with a brief, solemn ritual called ??
? signifying “the opening ceremony of the practice towards complete enlightenment.” In the 
next 5-10 minutes, the class supervisor (normally, the experienced practitioner) shares 
wisdom words preached by the enlightened Chan Master, Wu Chueh Miao Tien, the 85th 
patriarch of orthodox Dharma-Chan sect. Meanwhile, practitioners sit calmly with meditation 
posture and belly  
breathing, yet, eyes opening.  
    Then, formal Chan-meditation session begins. In the beginning meditation, practitioners 
focus on particular chakras to activate the intrinsic potency and wisdom of those chakras. 
Gradually, the entire body-mind-spirit enters into a field of harmony after transcending the 
physical, mental, emotional and conscious realm. The goal of Chan meditation is to realize the 
True Self with eternal wisdom.   
    After the meditation session, practitioners open eyes and listen to the sharing from the 
supervisor for about ten more minutes. Then, the class ends with a brief closing ritual and the  
chanting of The Song of True Self.
