2. Abstract—A novel low phase noise quadrature voltage-controlled oscillator (QVCO) with two 
coupled Hartley VCOs is proposed and implemented using the standard TSMC 0.18μm CMOS 
1P6M process. The QVCO employs pMOS as the core to reduce the up-conversion of 
low-frequency device noise to RF phase noise. It uses super-harmonic coupling technique to 
couple two differential Hartley VCOs and four small-size coupling transistors to set the 
directivity of quadrature output phases. At the 1.8V supply voltage, the output phase noise of the 
QVCO is -125.6 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset frequency from the carrier frequency of 5.05 GHz, and 
the figure of merit is -188.0 dB. At the supply voltage of 1.8 V, the total power consumption is 
17.4 mW. The die area is 0.982 x 0.992 mm2. 
 
Keywords—CMOS, quadrature voltage-controlled oscillators (QVCO), Hartley oscillator. 
 
3. Introduction 
Quadrature signal generators play a key role in many RF transceivers. Recently, 
considerable amount of the wireless industry’s effort has been focused on high level integration 
of the radio systems in CMOS technologies for cost reduction, especially in the Bluetooth and 
802.11 WLAN areas. Direct conversion transceiver is a promising solution for highest integration 
level, which mandates low phase noise and highly precise quadrature LO signals. In the past, 
many topologies of quadrature voltage controlled oscillator (QVCO) have been proposed, they 
include: 1) combination of VCO, polyphase-filter and output buffers [1], 2) VCO at double 
frequency followed by master slave flip flops [2], 3) two cross-coupled VCOs forced to run in 
quadrature by using two additional  pairs of parallel coupling transistors [3], 4) two 
cross-coupled VCOs with cascade structure forced to run in quadrature by using two pairs of 
series coupling transistors [4], 5) superharmonic coupling [5], 6) transformer coupling of two 
VCOs [6], etc.  
To obtain a low phase noise QVCO using two differential VCOs, using a VCO topology

Fig. 4. Measured tuning range of the proposed Hartley QVCO.  
5. Measurement Results 
  The die micrograph of the proposed QVCO is shown in Fig. 3. The chip area is 
0.982*0.992mm2 including pads. The transformer was realized with the metal 6. The metal 5 is  
employed as the underpass. The thicknesses of the top metal and the metal 5 are 2.34 μm and 
0.53 μm respectively. The thick metal improves the quality factor of transformer because of 
inherent low parasitic resistance. The inductor design was carried out using the Agilent ADS 
Momentum EM simulator.   
The standard FR4 material is used to build test board for the QVCO measurement. The die was 
glued directly onto the PC board with conductive materials, and aluminum wire-bonds were used 
to connect all input and output pads. The output spectrum was measured using the Agilent 
E4407B spectrum analyzer. The oscillating frequency can be tuned from 4.72 GHz to 5.1 GHz as 
shown in Fig. 4.  As the control voltage is increased, the varactor capacitance decreases, 
therefore the output frequency increases.  Power consumption is 17.4mW from the 1.8 V supply 
voltage.  
Fig. 5 shows the measured phase noise at the oscillation frequency of 5.05GHz, the QVCO was 
biased at Vdd=1.8V and Vtune=1.8V. The phase noise is -125.6dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset 
frequency from the 5.05GHz oscillating frequency. 
Fig. 6 shows the measured time-domain output waveforms of two quadrature VCO output 
buffers by using the Agilent 54855A Infiniium oscilloscope. The average output phase error is

6. Conclusion 
A 5GHz low-phase-noise Hartley QVCO based on CMOS technology is proposed and is 
implemented in the 0.18-μm triple-well 1P6M CMOS technology. In the proposed circuit, two 
differential Hartley VCOs are injection locked in quadrature by coupling their second-order 
harmonics in anti-phase, using a coupling network that exhibits high odd-mode and low 
even-mode impedance. The figure of merit for the proposed VCO is-188.0dBc/Hz, which is the 
highest FOM among published QVCOs. The QVCO shows phase noise of -125.6 dBc/Hz at 
1-MHz offset from the oscillation frequency of 5.05 GHz while dissipating only 17.4 mW for the 
whole QVCO from 1.8 V supply voltage.

a standard small-signal equivalent circuit of Colpitts oscillator, 
which has a tap between two capacitors. In Fig. 2(b), gm (=gmn + 
gmp), Cgs, and Cds represent the overall transconductance, the 
overall gate-source capacitance, and the drain-source 
capacitance of transistors Mn1, and Mp1 in Fig. 2 (a), 
respectively. The gmn and gmp are respectively the 
transconductance of Mn1 and Mp1. The two MOSFETs 
generate negative differential transconductance - gmp  and - gmn  
to compensate  for the tank loss.  
The detail of the proposed VCO is shown in Fig. 3(a). If we 
neglect the varactors, Figure 3(a) becomes a copy of Fig. 1(d), 
where the inverter is implemented as a complementary inverter. 
The maximum voltage amplitudes occur at the drain nodes of 
inverters. The drain voltages of inverters are controlled by the 
drain currents of voltage controlled transconductance 
amplifiers. When the gate voltage increases, the associated 
drain voltage decreases. So the drain and gate nodes can not be 
the virtual nodes.  The virtual grounds locate at the inductors L1, 
L2 between the drain and gate nodes of inverters.  The voltage 
amplitude exhibits monotonic variations with position with the 
maximum at the drain nodes. In the VCO shown in Fig. 3(a), 
energy injected from the drain outputs of the two cross-coupled 
inverters will split and will travel along the inductor ring in 
clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. The fundamental 
mode can travel along the lumped inductor, the fundamental 
mode is the dominant mode since higher modes are of relative 
insignificance due to the filtering circuit used.  
Since the VCO circuit is formed with lumped inductors, we 
can carry out the analysis using the circuit theory. Figure 3(b) 
shows the equivalent small-signal circuit used to calculate the

oscillation frequency, and the current sources are neglected for 
easy reading. The Cgs1 and Cds1 (Cgs2 and Cds2) are the net 
gate-source capacitance and drain-source capacitance of Mn1 
and Mp1 (Mn2 and Mp2). This differential VCO consists of 
two single-ended VCO’s shown in Fig. 2(a) and two inductors 
in between the VCOs. From Fig. 3(b) the derived oscillation 
frequency given by

the capacitances of varactors 1vC and 2vC  respectively. 
Equation (1) is also an oscillation frequency of Fig. 2, this 
indicates that the inductors between the two single-ended VCOs 
are to couple the single-ended VCOs to operate in the 
differential mode.  As VC  varies upon changing varactor bias, 
the virtual grounds also shift their positions along the inductors.  
In the implemented VCO, the phase velocity of wave varies 
along the conductive metal strip in each inductor due to 
different spatial capacitor loading. The oscillator frequency can 
be tuned using lumped varactors by placing lumped varactors 
across the inverters. Varying the degree of the varactor loading 
can change the capacitance and the frequency. The greater the 
capacitive loading, the greater the phase velocity shift 
introduced by the varactors, and the lower the frequency. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The proposed differential Colpitts VCO was fabricated by 
the TSMC 0.18um 1P6M CMOS technology and the micro- 
photograph of the fabricated chip is shown in Fig. 4 and the 
total chip area including pads is 1.142 x 0.514 mm2.  Four 
identical inductors are used. The circuit simulation was carried 
out by the simulation tool Spectre-RF. The simulated tool-ADS 
Momentum were used to simulate the parameters of inductors. 
On board measurements of output spectra were obtained using 
the Agilent E4407B spectrum analyzer. As the capacitance of 
the varactor Cv decreases, the oscillation frequency fosc  
increases. By varying bias across the varactors we can tune the 
oscillation frequency. Figure 5 shows the tuning ranges of the 
oscillation frequency versus varactor control voltage (Vtune) 
which is tuned from 0 to 1.5 V. The VCO operates between 5.76 
GHz and 6.76 GHz.
