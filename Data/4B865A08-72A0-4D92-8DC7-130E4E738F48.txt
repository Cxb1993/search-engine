Abstract 
在建構光學式符水印中，我們利用光學
式 的 邁 克 遜 干 涉 儀 (Mach-Zehnder 
interferometric)將輸入之標記影像經過符
立葉轉換後，利用干涉方式加以記錄在高
解析之 charge-coupled device (CCD)上。此
數位全像符水印即可以電子的方式嵌入任
何一張原始的封面影像中。經過嵌入數位
全像符水印之封面影像稱之為符水印影
像。符水印系統要求嵌入之資料須具備有
不易被人眼察覺的性質。在符水印之認證
過程中，我們將加上符水印之封面影像當
做一個光學式匹配濾波器之遮罩並且將其
置於一個光學式 VanderLugt 4-f 相關器之
符立葉轉換域中。以此來驗證在符水印影
像中是否存在授權之標記影像。 
在實驗中，我們發現由於加上封面影像
之符水印影像其分佈值很廣泛，因此 SLM
上非線性特性將無法避免。在此研究中我
們將探討，由於 SLM 之非線性對於光學符
水印系統中之相關信號的影響。首先，SLM
轉換函數之拉普拉斯(Laplace)轉換將被求
出。然後 SLM 之輸出將可由此轉換函數與
輸入函數之反拉普拉斯( Inverse Laplace)
轉換而得到。非線性 SLM 之輸出函數得到
之後，進一步再去計算在光學驗證系統之
相關信號輸出。最後根據理論分析的結果
來分析光學符水印系統之效能及非線性對
於此系統之影響。

1. Background. 
In our previous research [1], we propose 
an optical processing system for holographic 
watermarking scheme, in which the 
watermark is constructed with a Fourier 
hologram, and thus the watermarked 
hologram is embedded into a cover image. 
For detecting the authorized watermark, the 
watermarked image is displayed by an 
electrically addressed spatial light modulator 
(SLM) and used as a Fourier domain mask of 
a weighting matched filter. In order to 
acquire the correlation between the hidden 
mark in the watermarked image and the 
authorized mark, we construct an optically 
VanderLugt 4-f correlator for the detection. 
The first order correlation signal of this 
correlator can be used to identify whether the 
authorized mark is appeared in the 
watermarked image. The proposed scheme 
both construction and detection procedures 
of the holographic watermarks are performed 
optically to fully utilize the processing power 
of light. By the experiments, we find that the 
nonlinearity of the SLM in the Fourier 
domain of the VanderLugt correlator will 
seriously affect the correlation output, and 
thus it affect the judgment of the authorized 
watermark. In this project, we examine the 
nonlinear effect of the SLM device, and in 
advance to study the effects of nonlinearity 
on the correlation output. 
 
2. Optical watermarking system. 
Here, let us denote the mark pattern and 
the random-phase image as ),( yxhm  and 
[ ]),(exp yxjφ respectively. Hence, the 
randomly phase-modulated mark image can 
be written as 
[ ]),(exp),(),( yxjyxhyxh m φ= .     (1) 
Then, following Fourier transform by 
lens L1, the Fourier spectrum of the 
phase-modulated mark image in the Fourier 
domain can be expressed as

Fig. 2: The relationship between the input and 
output signals of the SLM. 
Based on this nonlinearity, we use the 
nonlinear power law transfer function to 
model the optically address SLM. For the 
theoretical analysis, we first introduce the 
Laplace transform of power-law transfer 
function, and then we apply it to the 
determination of the output signal of the 
nonlinear device. Here let us consider the 
watermarked image ),( βαx  as the input of 
the nonlinear SLM device. Due to the 
magnitude of the cover image is positive and 
the watermarked image is the addition of the 
cover image and a small amount of 
weighting of the holography watermark, we 
utilize the half-wave υ -th law transfer 
characteristic

When 1=υ , we have a linear device, while 
1>>υ  or 1<<υ  indicates severe 
nonlinearity. To find the output of the 
nonlinear device, we derive the Laplace 
transform of the half-wave Power Law 
function.

derived by the corresponding inverse

correlation. Since the phase field ),( βαφH

high-order phase terms ),( βαφHm  are 
completely uncorrelated with the original 
phase. Thus, only the first-order term in Eq. 
(13) matches the phase and achieve sharp 
correlation signal. Here, we consider only 
the 1=m  term, assuming that zV =ω , we

by the embedded watermark. The peak 
signal-to-noise is defined as ( )MSEPSNR n 12log20 −≡ , where MSE is the 
mean square error between the watermarked 
image and the cover image, and n  is the 
number of bit for representing images. Based 
on the result in Fig. 3(d), with PSNR = 33.9, 
we conclude that the quality of the 
watermarked image remains satisfactory for 
this weighting factor.

Correlation intensity of using correct mark, and 
(b) that of incorrect mark. 
 
We examine the correlation results by 
considering detection of the watermarked 
image in Fig. 3(d) as the input of the 
VanderLugt watermark correlator. As shown 
in Fig 4(a), when the detector has the correct 
mark pattern and the exact diffused random 
phase, it produces a sharp correlation at 
)0 ,( a− , where we shows a small area on the 
correlation plane around this point. Note that, 
the high-order terms will not generate any 
correlation signal on the output plane, and 
the first-order correlation is spatially 
separated from the zero-order term and 
convolution term in Eq. (17). In contrast, 
there is no correlation peak for the incorrect 
mark pattern, as shown in Fig 4(b). 
Experimental results indicate that the 
correlation is suitable for detecting and 
verifying the specified watermark embedded 
in a cover image. 
Comparing the experimental results 
(dashed line) and the analytic solutions (solid 
line) in the Fig. 5, we use the cover image 
and the watermark in Fig. 3 as the inputs of 
the watermarking system. In this Figure, we 
illustrate the correlation values under varying 
severities of the nonlinearity and three 
different weighting values. The experimental 
correlation results are obtained by using the 
computer to simulate the overall procedure 
of the nonlinear watermarking system with 
different weighting values and nonlinearity. 
In the same time, the analytic solution is 
evaluated by the Eq. (18), where we use only 
the first two terms (i.e., 2,1 == landl ) in 
Eq. (10) for the output correlation intensity. 
This figure shows the correctness of using 
the theoretical derivation to analyze the 
detection correlation in our system. Notes 
that, although the Eq. (15) is approximated 
by only the first two terms, this 
approximation can still be very accurate with 
the error less than the order of 310− .
