ABSTRACT 
In this study, an electroencephalogram (EEG) recog-
nition system is proposed on single-trial motor imagery 
(MI) data. Unsupervised penalized fuzzy neural network 
(PFNN) clustering is used for the unsupervised recogni-
tion of left and right MI data by combining with selected 
active segments and multiresolution fractal features. Ac-
tive segment selection is used to detect active segments 
situated at most discriminable area in the time-frequency 
domain. The multiresolution fractal features are then 
extracted by using modified fractal dimension from 
wavelet data. Finally, PFNN clustering is used as the 
discriminant of MI features. The PFNN clustering is an 
adaptive approach suitable for the clustering of 
non-stationary biomedical signals. Compared with sever-
al popular supervised classifiers, PFNN clustering pro-
vides a potential for BCI application.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The brain–computer interface (BCI) is a new commu-
nication system that provides an alternative channel for 
directly transmitting messages from the human brain to 
computers by analyzing the brain’s mental activities 
[1–3]. BCI systems based on the single-trial analysis of 
electroencephalographic (EEG) signals associated with 
imagined finger movements (motor imagery; MI) have 
grown rapidly in the last decade [2]. EEG analysis fo-
cuses on discriminating left MI from right MI using 
event-related brain potentials (ERP), revealing that there 
are special characteristics of event-related desynchroni-
zation (ERD) and synchronization (ERS) in mu and beta 
rhythms over the sensorimotor cortices during MI tasks 
[4, 5]. 
The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) gives a 
highly redundant representation of EEG signals in the 
time-scale domain, so it can be applied for the precise 
localization of ERP components in the time-scale domain 
[6]. However, it is time consuming in terms of computa-
tion time. Accordingly, we utilize the CWT and Stu-
dent’s two-sample t-statistics to obtain, off-line, the lo-
cation of active segments from the time-frequency do-
main in this study. In BCI work, feature extraction is a 
significant and important topic that greatly affects the 
success of classification. More specifically, the better the 
extracted features, the higher the classification accuracy 
we can expect. Consequently, we use the DWT and 
fractal dimension to extract multiresolution fractal fea-
ture vectors for classification. As the DWT is fairly po-
werful in selecting features in multiresolution, it is an 
efficient and structured approach to ERP representation 
[7, 8]. 
Fractal geometry [9] provides a proper mathematical 
model to describe complex and irregular shapes that exist 
in nature by using fractal features. Fractal dimension is 
one of the most commonly used fractal features and has 
been applied to various biomedical signal analyses, such 
as seizure onset detection in epilepsy [10] and EEG ana-
lyses of sleeping newborns [11]. In this study, we first 
use DWT to decompose native EEG signals into multis-
cales, and then obtain multiresolution fractal feature 
vectors (MFFVs) from multiscale EEG signals by calcu-
lating their fractal dimensions. In addition to multiscale 
characteristics, MFFVs also contain important fractal 
information in the time-scale space. As MFFVs have 
been shown to achieve promising results in MI applica-
tions [12], we have opted to use MFFVs as features in 
this study. 
Supervised classifiers are usually applied to recognize 
MI EEG data in most BCI systems. Some of these clas-
sifiers, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [13], 
multilayer perceptron (MLP) [14] and support vector 
machine (SVM) [15], are quite popular and are generally

plot that retains the scale separation of ERP components 
[6, 20]. 
However, the 2D time-scale plot ( )kjW ,  generated 
from the CWT is so noisy that it is difficult to accurately 
locate the active segment. The 2D anisotropic Gaussian 
filter is proposed to smooth the power spectrum and 
reduce the noise effects in the time-frequency domain,

addition, the best discriminant region is not situated at a 
single point but lies in a range of time and scale. We 
considered the time and scale range by convoluting the 
above-mentioned 2D anisotropic Gaussian filter, and 
found that by using a wider frequency range a higher 
classification accuracy can be achieved from the acquired 
EEG signals than with a narrower one [21]. It is because 
the wider range contains all the mu and beta rhythmic 
components that are important for mental task classifica-
tion. Therefore, we accumulate the power spectrum 
along the scale direction within the wide frequency range. 
The resulting profile represents the brain ERP responses 
for left and right MI. 
Student’s two-sample t-statistics between the left and 
right MI are evaluated from the training data set in both 
C3 and C4 channels,

The denominator in equation (3) indicates the pooled 
variance of left and right MI. ( )kt  with different time k 
can form a 1D profile with respect to time, but it con-
tains different characteristics. The peaks in the profile 
( )kt  imply that there are local maximal differences be-
tween left and right MI in the time-scale domain, mean-
ing the left and right MI are best discriminated at a par-
ticular time and scale range. The t-statistics are used to 
select the optimal active segment. The active segment of 
length 1s is then selected, with its center being the peak 
after the C3 and C4 channels are concatenated. 
C. Feature extraction 
Prior to classification, feature extraction is performed 
on the selected 1-s active segment rather than directly 
classifying the native EEG data without feature ex-
trac-tion. Feature extraction greatly affects the results of 
classification; accordingly, the better the extracted fea-
tures, the higher the classification accuracy we can ex-
pect. In this study, we first band-pass filtered the active 
segments to the wide frequency range that contains all 
mu and beta rhythmic components using a Butterworth 
band-pass filter. We then performed the discrete wavelet 
transformand fractal dimension on the filtered active 
segments. 
Multiresolution analysis decomposes a signal into nu-
merous details at various resolutions, where each resolu-
tion represents a class of distinct physical charac-teristics 
within the signal. In other words, a signal is characte-
rized with the formulation by decomposing it into 
sub-bands, and each sub-band can be treated in-
di-vidually based on its characteristics. Multiresolution 
representation of the filtered active segments is achieved 
by discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The active seg-
ment A for each trial is represented in terms of the DWT

model to describe a complex shape that exists in nature 
with fractal features. Fractal dimension (FD) is one of

The Hopfield neural network with simple architecture 
and parallel potential has been applied in many fields [27, 
32, 33]. In this paper, the authors applied the discrete 
Hopfield neural network with the penalized fuzzy 
c-means strategy [27] (called PFNN) to clustering tech-
niques. For n  training samples and c  classes, the 
PFNN consists of cn×  neurons, which can be con-
ceived as a two-dimensional array. Each sample is itera-
tively trained to update the neurons’ weights by using the 
nearest neighbor rule. 
Let jiu ,  be the fuzzy state of the ( )thji.  neuron and 
jkjiW ,;,  represents the interconnected weight between 
neuron ( )ji,  and neuron ( )jk, . A neuron ( )ji,  in the 
network receives weighted inputs jkjiW ,;,  from each 
neuron ( )jk,  and a bias jiI ,  from outside. The total 
input to neuron ( )ji,  is computed as

The first term in Eq. (13) is the within-class scatter 
energy that is the average distance between training 
samples to the cluster centroid over c  clusters. The 
second term guarantees that the n  training samples in 
X  can only be distributed among these c  classes. 
More specifically, the second term imposes constraints 
on the objective function and the first term minimizes the 
intra-class Euclidean distance from training vectors to 
the cluster centroid in any given cluster. The last term is 
the penalized term as given in Eq. (7) of the PFCM algo-
rithm. 
As mentioned in ref. [33], the quality of the classifica-
tion result is very sensitive to the weighting factors A 
and B. Searching for optimal values for these weighting 
factors is time-consuming and laborious. To alleviate this 
problem, a two-dimensional Hopfield neural network 
with penalized fuzzy c-means clustering strategy, called 
PFNN, is proposed so that the constraint terms can be 
handled more efficiently. In PFNN, all the neurons in the 
same row compete one another to determine which neu-
ron has the maximum membership value belonging to 
class j . The summation of the membership grade of 
states in the same row equals 1, and the total member-
ship states in all n  rows equal n . It is also ensured 
that all training vectors will be classified into these c  
classes. The modified Hopfield neural network PFNN 
enables the scatter energy function to converge rapidly to 
a minimum value. By using the PFCM strategy, the scat-
ter energy of the PFNN can be simplified as

The minimization of energy E  in Eq. (14) is greatly 
simplified since it contains only two terms and hence the 
need to determine the weighting factors A and B vanish-
es. Comparing Eq. (14) with the modified Lyapunov

proposed for left and right MI classification from sin-
gle-trial EEG data in this study. The PFNN algorithm is 
implemented to recognize left and right MI data without 
any training in advance. As PFNN clustering is an unsu-
pervised approach that partitions a collection of feature 
vectors into a number of subgroups based on minimizing 
the trace of a within-cluster scatter matrix, it is adopted 
to automatically classify MFFVs into two clusters, left 
and right MI. Moreover, EEG data are non-stationary 
and their inherent characteristics vary with time. The 
classification of MI EEG data using unsupervised PFNN 
clustering may result in a better generalization perfor-
mance than conventional supervised classifiers. Some 
attractive properties of PFNN clustering are summarized 
as follows: first, PFNN clustering is an unsupervised 
method, discriminating the data without labeling them 
before training; second, PFNN clustering is capable of 
making flexible partitions of a finite data set; and third, 
PFNN clustering is a robust approach suitable for the 
classification of non-stationary biomedical signals. 
Therefore, we use PFNN clustering for the classification 
of MI EEG data in this study. We compare the perfor-
mance of PFNN clustering with three supervised classifi-
ers that are widely-used and have been shown to provide 
good results in BCI studies. The first classifier is linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) [13], used to find the direc-
tion in the feature space along which the distance of the 
means relative to the within-class scatter reaches a max-
imum. The second classifier is a multilayer perceptron 
(MLP) with one hidden layer and sigmoid activation 
functions [14]. The third classifier is a nonlinear suppo rt 
vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function 
(RBF) kernel [15], which is used to classify the feature 
patterns based on minimum error risk criterion. The op-
timal values for the parameters, weights and biases of all 
supervised classifiers were estimated using the aforemen-
tioned ten-fold cross validation methodology. 
An experiment for evaluating the performance of the 
unsupervised PFNN clustering method was performed. 
Table 2 shows the comparisons of classification accuracy 
among the LDA, MLP, SVM and PFNN methods. All 
classifiers were used with the same selected active seg-
ments in this table; in other words, the listed values 
demonstrate only the deviations of performance among 
different classifiers. For subject 1, the best recognition 
rate was achieved using PFNN as the classifier, while the 
classification obtained using LDA had the worst recogni-
tion rate, the difference between the best and worst rec-
ognition rates being 5.2%. Moreover, using SVM as the 
classifier obtains the second highest recognition rate, 
which was only 1.4% less than the best one. For subject 
2, the best recognition rate was obtained using SVM as 
the classifier, while the classification obtained using LDA 
had the worst recognition rate. For subject 3, the best 
and worst recognition rates were found to be the same as 
those of subject 2. Overall, the best average recognition 
rate (83.6%) was obtained using SVM, while using LDA 
yielded the worst average recognition rate (79.6%), the 
difference being 4.0%. Moreover, PFNN obtained the 
second highest recognition rate (83.1%), which is only 
slightly less (0.5%) than that of SVM. 
Moreover, we observe that classification with SVM 
gives the best results for two subjects, and classification 
with PFNN leads to the best results for one subject. This 
can be explained by the fact that PFNN clustering is ap-
propriate for the classification of non-stationary MI EEG 
signals because it is a robust discriminator. Traditional 
supervised classification methods, such as MLP, have 
suffered from difficulties in generalization, often obtain-
ing models that over-fit the training data, which is why 
we chose to apply PFNN clustering in the classification 
of MI EEG data in this study. In addition, PFNN clus-
tering is considered a good classifier because it is an un-
supervised clustering-based method. For BCI work, 
PFNN clustering does not need to train the parameters of 
the classifier in advance, and it is suitable for dealing 
with non-stationary biomedical data sets. In summary, 
PFNN is suitable for mental task classification. The dif-
ference between the classification results of PFNN and 
SVM is small for all subjects; however, the computation
