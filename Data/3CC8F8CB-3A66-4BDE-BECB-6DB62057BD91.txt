Abstract 
Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is widely used as 
pesticide and wood preservative. After broadly 
applied in a great quantity for several decades, PCP 
can be found in most natural environments. Thus, 
PCP becomes one of most prevalent underground 
contaminants due to its slow rate of biodegradation. 
Electrochemical oxidation has been applied as a 
remedy scheme for many refractory compounds such 
as pesticides and chlorinated phenols. Besides, 
electrochemical technology can be applied as a tool 
for highly sensitive and rapid measurement. The 
original objective of this research is to develop an 
associated scheme of ultrasonic extraction and 
electrochemical oxidation for removing PCP from 
soil. First, the mechanism of ultrasonic extraction is 
utilized to partition PCP from soil matrix to the slurry 
solution. The extract is further filtered through 
ultra-filtration (UF) membrane and sequentially 
subjected to electrochemical oxidation for the 
purpose of de-chlorination and degradation of PCP. 
However, the presented study is focused on the 
application of electrochemical technology as a 
detection tool and/or as a dechlorination scheme for 
chlorophenols due to the limitation of budget and 
time. 
In the experiments of electrochemical 
measurement, a tri-electrode system used a platinum 
(Pt) electrode as working electrode, a Pt wire as 
counter electrode, and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode 
as reference electrode. Electrochemical analyzer is 
operated in a linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) mode: 
scan rate 0.3 V/s, 0.1M Na2SO4 as electrolyte, and 
96.5±0.7%[曾聖倫 , 2004]。HPLC亦被應用於
200mg/kg的酸性及鹼性土壤之五氯酚測定分析，其
回收率分別為 58.93%與 53.71%[邱瑞斌, 2002]。至

6.2五氯酚脫氯降解 
探討白金電極對於電解氧化水中五氯酚，在不同電
解電壓條件下對五氯酚進行電解破壞去除以及了解氯
離子釋放量之情形。配製 5mg/L 的五氯酚溶液，在電
解質 0.1 M Na2SO4、電壓範圍：1.80 V至-1.20V的
條件下，以電化學分析儀進行循環伏安法(Cyclic 
Voltammrtey,CV)測定，其結果如圖 6-6所示。由圖
6-6得知，極譜圖中出現氧化及還原反應的波峰，
由於白金電極屬於還原性電極，因此本研究實驗選
擇還原電位 0.3 V附近做為電解實驗之操作電壓。
在工作電極為白金電極的系統中，比較不同電解電
壓操作之五氯酚移除效果於圖 6-7。由圖 6-7得知，
以使用電解電壓 0.30 V(vs. Ag/AgCl)，電解質為 0.1 
M Na2SO4為最佳的操作條件，電解 60 min 後五氯
酚可達到 56 ％的移除效率；而使用電解電壓 0.2 V
及 0.4 V(vs. Ag/AgCl)之實驗組對五氯酚的移除效
率分別為 37 ％及 7％。由此可知，施予的電壓提
高並無法提升去除效率，反而使五氯酚的去除效率
受到限制。於實驗過程中同時採樣分析溶液中氯離
子的濃度變化，並計算五氯酚脫氯效率。由圖 6-8
得知，在電解電壓 0.30V (vs. Ag/AgCl) )，電解質為
0.1 M Na2SO4條件下，電解 60min 後五氯酚溶液中
氯離子的釋放率可達 56％；而使用電解電壓 0.2 V
及 0.4 V(vs. Ag/AgCl)之實驗組在電解 60min 後，
其氯離子的釋放率分別為 20％及 10％。對比五氯
酚之降解率與脫氯率的數據，於電解電壓 0.30V (vs. 
Ag/AgCl) )之操作條件，發現降解效率與脫氯率相
當，此結果暗示降解之五氯酚可以達到完全脫氯的
效果。

ABSTRACT 
In this study, electrochemical oxidation was proposed as a remediation method for 
aqueous methomyl. Lab data showed that electrolyte species instead of its 
concentration could significantly affect the extent and rate of oxidation. 
Comparing with NaCl and KCl, use of Na2SO4 as the electrolyte causes the 
low-efficiency oxidation for methomyl. Electrochemical experiments showed that 
the degradation of methomyl was less than 20 % at 1.2V of oxidizing potential, 
and it implied that 1.2V of oxidizing potential was not sufficient for continuous 
generation of radicals or strong oxidants in great amounts. Under the strong 
oxidizing potentials (above 2.4 V), the chain electrochemical reactions can be 
triggered to produce more radicals or strong oxidants and thus lead to a complete 
degradation of methomyl. During the process of electrochemical oxidation, 
methomyl can be successfully mineralized to carbon dioxide and water without 
the remaining of intermediates or by-products based upon the examination of 
HPLC-MS. In addition, the extent and rate of methomyl degradation appeared 
relatively slow at the presence of calcium. Different levels of calcium 
concentrations (150 mg/L and 300 mg/L) showed a similar degree of depression 
on methomyl degradation. Calcium ion can be reduced and adsorbed on the 
surface of electrode, and thus the formed electrode deposit could reduce the 
current efficiency and lead to the depression of methomyl degradation.

INTRODUCTION 
Methomyl, one of carbamate pesticides, is widely used in agricultural applications for 
crop protection. The annual usage of methomyl is estimated over a thousand ton in 
Taiwan, and its applications cover the bug control for vegetables, tobacco, or corn. 
Methomyl is able to induce pesticide poisoning or fatalities, and sometimes, it is 
involved in suicides or homicides. For example, methomyl has been intentionally 
misused in a seafood-poisoning incident to injure over one hundred people at 
Kaohsiung (Taiwan) in 2002. Besides, pesticide residual on the vegetables is another 
concern for methomyl uptake via the intake of vegetables. The uptake of methomyl 
can induce acute poisoning by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity 
reversibly with a subsequent accumulation of acetylcholine at peripheral and central 
nervous systems (WHO, 1996). Symptoms of poisoning include excessive salivation, 
accelerated excretion in the respiratory tract, seizures, and even death due to paralysis 
of the respiratory muscles (Ecobichon, 1996; Moriya and Hashimoto, 2005). 
 
Because of their toxic characteristics, pesticides are not easily biodegradable on a 
regular basis. There are various innovative methodologies proposed as an alternative 
for the decontamination of pesticides in water such as photocatalytic oxidation, 
ultrasonic radation, bioremediation, thermal desorption…etc. (Arapoglou et al., 2003). 
表 Y04 
composed of an electrochemical analyzer, an electrolytic cell, a magnetic stirrer and a 
thermostatic water bath. The volume of the electrolytic cell is only 14 ml, in which the 
cathode and the anode are placed in the same compartment. The electrolytic cell was 
equipped with a Pt electrode as working electrode (WE), a Pt wire as counter 
electrode (CE) and a saturated Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode (RE). The 
voltage source was supplied and precisely controlled by a BAS 100B Electrochemical 
Analyzer. During the experiment, the liquor of the reactor was completely mixed with 
a mini stirrer and the reaction temperature was controlled by the recycle of cooling 
water from the thermostatic water bath. 
 
Oxidation Experiments 
Lab works were focused on the technical feasibility and performance of 
electrochemical oxidation of methomyl at a bench-scale reactor. The initial 
concentration of 100 mg/l methomyl (about 0.617mM) was prepared in solute to 
simulate pesticide contamination of potable water each run. For the ease of 
electrochemical reaction, three electrolytes including KCl, NaCl and Na2SO4 were 
employed in batch experiments. The oxidation of methomyl was investigated under 
various electrolytes and also compared at different electrolyte concentrations. Only 
single electrolyte was used each run and its concentration was maintained at least 0.1 
mol/l in the electrolytic cell. Oxidation experiments were carried out at a constant 
operating voltage in the range of 1.2 V and 3.0 V. Before each oxidation experiment, 
working electrode was cleaned with tiny 0.05μm aluminum powder by remittently 
wet-polishing to rub out adsorbed deposits on the electrode surface. Reference 
electrode was immersed in 3 mol/l KCl solution to maintain its saturated status while 
not in use. Each run was lasted for 120 minutes and sampled with a syringe every 30 
minutes. The sampled liquor was instantly subjected to the analysis of high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the determination of methomyl 
concentration. Based on HPLC chromatogram, several selected samples were further 
analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography/ mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) 
to identify byproducts or intermediates of methomyl degradation. 
 
Sample Analysis 
Following Taiwan EPA standard analysis method NIEA W633.50A (Taiwan EPA, 
1994), the analysis of methomyl was implemented by reverse-phase high performance 
liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The HPLC-UV system was 
mainly composed of a Hitachi L-7100 LC pumping module, a Hitachi L-7420 UV 
diode array detector and a Mightysil 5μm-C18, 4.6mm × 250mm RP column. The 
detector wavelength was set at 254nm as reference. The mobile-phase composition 
was maintained at a 25 / 75 ratio of methanol and water, and the mobile-phase flow 
was controlled at 1 ml/min. Under these analytical operations, the retention time of 
methomyl occurred at 8.5 min on the HPLC chromatogram. Methomyl standard 
solutions were prepared in water in a concentration range of 0.5 mg/l and 120mg/l. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effect of Electrolyte Concentration 
Platinum electrodes were concurrently used as both cathode and anode in the 
proposed electrochemical reactor. As using a high oxygen overvoltage anode, 
表 Y04 
supplied potential reaching 1.8V or above. At the presence of chloride ion, the 
involved electrochemical reactions can produce strong oxidants (such as Cl2, HOCl, 
HClO2 and O3) to oxidize aqueous methomyl. Because these electrogenerated 
oxidants have stronger oxidizing potentials than oxygen, the observed degradation of 
methomyl was greatly improved as operating potential above1.8V. These involved 
electrochemical reactions may be giving by the following: 
 
 2 Cl－ → Cl2 + 2 e－        E0 = -1.36 V (4) 
 
 1/2 Cl2 + H2O → HOCl + H+ + e－     E0 = -1.63 V (5) 
 
 HOCl + H2O → HClO2 + 2 H+ + 2 e－     E0 = -1.645 V (6) 
 
 O2 + H2O → O3 + 2 H+ + 2 e－      E0 = -2.07 V (7) 
 
As using 0.1 mol/l KCl as electrolyte, a complete degradation of methomyl was 
observed after 2 hours of electrochemical oxidation under oxidizing potential of 2.4V. 
However, a continual increase of oxidizing potential to 3.0V did not result in a rapid 
degradation rate during electrochemical oxidation in Fig 3a. The possible deduction is 
that the oxidation of water may produce hydroxyl radical under oxidizing potential of 
3.0V as the mechanism of reaction (1) and simultaneously induce the generation of 
other oxidants as the mechanism of reaction (3) to reaction (7), however the 
self-scavenging reaction can be triggered around the electrode to consume the 
electrogenerated oxidants due to the strong oxidizing potential of hydroxyl radical. 
 
In Fig3b, the ascending trend of methomyl degradation is obvious with intensifying 
oxidizing potential of electrochemical oxidation. The optimum oxidizing potential 
was found around 2.4V for attaining satisfied removal efficiency through 
electrochemical oxidation. Under this optimum oxidizing potential (2.4V), complete 
degradation of methomyl can be achieved for both cases of concentrated electrolyte 
(1.0 mol/l KCl) and diluted electrolyte (0.1 mol/l KCl). As shown in Fig 4, an 
intensive specific degradation rate of methomyl is correspondent to the case using 
concentrated electrolyte and vice versa. This observation indicated that concentrated 
electrolyte can support the undergoing of electrochemical oxidation but oxidizing 
potential is the determining factor for the success of the proposed treatment system.

effect on methomyl oxidation was observed in both cases of 150 mg/l and 300 mg/l as 
CaCO3. Under the environment of hard water, the observed inhibition effect can 
induce 30% depression of methomyl removal in Fig 6. The inhibition effect may 
result from the competition of methomyl and calcium ion to react with 
electrogenerated oxidants or the complicated chemical chain reactions with calcium. 
Calcium ion can be reduced and adsorbed on the electrode surface, and the fact of 
surface deposit on the electrode was testified form experimental observations. Besides, 
the absorbed deposit on the electrode can block electron transfer and reduce current 
efficiency, for that reason the removal of methomyl from hard water becomes more 
difficult via electrochemical oxidation.

CONCLUSIONS 
This work studied the technical feasibility and performance of electrochemical 
oxidation on the Pt electrode for the treatment of aqueous methomyl. Based on the 
results of electrochemical experiments, several concluding remarks were summarized 
as follows: 
y The degradation of methomyl is favorable as using concentrated electrolyte (1.0 
mol/l) in the process of electrochemical treatment. The concentration of 
electrolyte is suggested to maintain at least 1,000 times larger than the pollutant 
level for attaining the efficient removal, especially operating under an 
insufficient oxidizing potential. 
y Oxidizing potential is the determining factor for the success of the 
electrochemical treatment system. Different levels of oxidizing potential not only 
offer graded intensity of electron transfer but also initiate diverse electrochemical 
reactions to generate radicals and strong oxidants. In this work, the full removal 
of methomyl can be accomplished with the optimum oxidizing potential of 2.4V 
through electrochemical oxidation. 
y KCl and NaCl are superior to Na2SO4 to serve as electrolyte for electrochemical 
oxidation of methomyl. Due to the participation of chloride ion in chained 
electrochemical reaction, electrogenerated strong oxidants (such as Cl2, HOCl,

Abstract 
In this study, electrochemical oxidation was proposed as a remediation method for aqueous 
methomyl. Lab data showed that electrolyte species instead of its concentration could significantly 
affect the extent and rate of oxidation. Comparing with NaCl and KCl, use of Na2SO4 as the 
electrolyte causes the low-efficiency oxidation for methomyl. Electrochemical experiments 
showed that the degradation of methomyl was less than 20 % at 1.2V of oxidizing potential, and it 
implied that 1.2V of oxidizing potential was not sufficient for continuous generation of radicals or 
strong oxidants in great amounts. Under the strong oxidizing potentials (above 2.4 V), the chain 
electrochemical reactions can be triggered to produce more radicals or strong oxidants and thus 
lead to a complete degradation of methomyl. During the process of electrochemical oxidation, 
methomyl can be successfully mineralized to carbon dioxide and water without the remaining of 
intermediates or by-products based upon the examination of HPLC-MS. In addition, the extent and 
rate of methomyl degradation appeared relatively slow at the presence of calcium. Different levels 
of calcium concentrations (150 mg/L and 300 mg/L) showed a similar degree of depression on 
methomyl degradation. Calcium ion can be reduced and adsorbed on the surface of electrode, and 
thus the formed electrode deposit could reduce the current efficiency and lead to the depression of 
methomyl degradation.

INTRODUCTION 
Methomyl, one of carbamate pesticides, is widely used in agricultural applications for crop 
protection. The annual usage of methomyl is estimated over a thousand ton in Taiwan, and its 
applications cover the bug control for vegetables, tobacco, or corn. Methomyl is able to induce 
pesticide poisoning or fatalities, and sometimes, it is involved in suicides or homicides. For 
example, methomyl has been intentionally misused in a seafood-poisoning incident to injure over 
one hundred people at Kaohsiung (Taiwan) in 2002. Besides, pesticide residual on the vegetables is 
another concern for methomyl uptake via the intake of vegetables. The uptake of methomyl can 
induce acute poisoning by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity reversibly with a 
subsequent accumulation of acetylcholine at peripheral and central nervous systems (WHO, 1996). 
Symptoms of poisoning include excessive salivation, accelerated excretion in the respiratory tract, 
seizures, and even death due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles (Ecobichon, 1996; Moriya and 
Hashimoto, 2005). 
 
Because of their toxic characteristics, pesticides are not easily biodegradable on a regular basis. 
There are various innovative methodologies proposed as an alternative for the decontamination of 
pesticides in water such as photocatalytic oxidation, ultrasonic radation, bioremediation, thermal 
desorption…etc. (Arapoglou et al., 2003). The employment of electrochemical treatment for 
recalcitrant toxics is especially drawing much attention recently (Vlyssides et al., 2005). 
Electrochemical oxidation has the advantage of high sensitivity, easy control and without secondary 
pollution, and also it has been successfully applied as a remedy scheme for many refractory 
pesticides (Brillas et al., 2000; Ventura et al., 2002) and chlorinated phenols (Brillas et al., 2003; 
Torres et al., 2003). Besides, electrochemical oxidation can selectively degrade contaminants to 
certain extent by the mechanism of electro-catalysis.

For the ease of electrochemical reaction, three electrolytes including KCl, NaCl and Na2SO4 were 
employed in batch experiments. The oxidation of methomyl was investigated under various 
electrolytes and also compared at different electrolyte concentrations. Only single electrolyte was 
used each run and its concentration was maintained at least 0.1 mol/l in the electrolytic cell. 
Oxidation experiments were carried out at a constant operating voltage in the range of 1.2 V and 3.0 
V. Before each oxidation experiment, working electrode was cleaned with tiny 0.05μm aluminum 
powder by remittently wet-polishing to rub out adsorbed deposits on the electrode surface. 
Reference electrode was immersed in 3 mol/l KCl solution to maintain its saturated status while not 
in use. Each run was lasted for 120 minutes and sampled with a syringe every 30 minutes. The 
sampled liquor was instantly subjected to the analysis of high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) for the determination of methomyl concentration. Based on HPLC chromatogram, several 
selected samples were further analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography/ mass 
spectrometry (HPLC/MS) to identify byproducts or intermediates of methomyl degradation. 
 
Sample Analysis 
Following Taiwan EPA standard analysis method NIEA W633.50A (Taiwan EPA, 1994), the 
analysis of methomyl was implemented by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography 
with UV detection (HPLC-UV). The HPLC-UV system was mainly composed of a Hitachi L-7100 
LC pumping module, a Hitachi L-7420 UV diode array detector and a Mightysil 5μm-C18, 4.6mm 
× 250mm RP column. The detector wavelength was set at 254nm as reference. The mobile-phase 
composition was maintained at a 25 / 75 ratio of methanol and water, and the mobile-phase flow 
was controlled at 1 ml/min. Under these analytical operations, the retention time of methomyl 
occurred at 8.5 min on the HPLC chromatogram. Methomyl standard solutions were prepared in 
water in a concentration range of 0.5 mg/l and 120mg/l. 
 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Effect of Electrolyte Concentration 
Platinum electrodes were concurrently used as both cathode and anode in the proposed 
electrochemical reactor. As using a high oxygen overvoltage anode, hydroxyl radical can be 
generated through the oxidation of water (Panizza et al., 2000). The electrogenerated hydroxyl 
radical was first absorbed on the active sites of the electrode surface, and the absorbed hydroxyl 
radical was subsequently released to oxidize aqueous pollutant in solute (Vlyssides et al., 2005). 
The occurring electrochemical reactions within the electrolytic cell are complicated and not entirely 
known. According to the result of HPLC/MS analysis, there was no aqueous intermediate identified 
during the electrolysis of methomyl. The complete mineralization of methomyl was logically 
assumed, in other word, the oxidation products of methomyl are carbon dioxide, nitrate and sulfate. 
Thus, the mechanism of direct oxidation of methomyl was proposed as follows: 
 
 H2O → OH*abs + H+ + e－       E0 = -2.85 V (1) 
 
 C5H10N2O2S + 18OH*abs→ 5CO2 + 2NO3－ + SO42－ + 28 H+ + 24e－  (2) 
 
Based on the analysis of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical experiments were performed at a 
constant oxidizing potential of 1.2 V in order to conduct the oxidation of water. As using three 
levels of electrolyte concentrations, the degradation of methomyl during electrochemical 
experiments was compared in Fig 2. It is clear that a slow degradation of methomyl can be achieved 
under all electrolyte concentrations, however the removal efficiency is more significant when using 
1.0 mol/l KCl as electrolyte. Therefore, the electrolyte concentration had better to maintain at least 
1,000 times larger than the pollutant level for supporting effective electron transfer in aqueous 
attaining satisfied removal efficiency through electrochemical oxidation. Under this optimum 
oxidizing potential (2.4V), complete degradation of methomyl can be achieved for both cases of 
concentrated electrolyte (1.0 mol/l KCl) and diluted electrolyte (0.1 mol/l KCl). As shown in Fig 4, 
an intensive specific degradation rate of methomyl is correspondent to the case using concentrated 
electrolyte and vice versa. This observation indicated that concentrated electrolyte can support the 
undergoing of electrochemical oxidation but oxidizing potential is the determining factor for the 
success of the proposed treatment system.

Effect of Electrolyte Species 
In this study, three common electrolytes including KCl, NaCl and Na2SO4 were tested under the 
optimum oxidizing potential. As it is observed from Fig 5, there was no remaining methomyl 
detected in the both cases of KCl and NaCl. In the case of Na2SO4, the performance of methomyl 
removal was very poor. As mentioned previously, KCl and NaCl can initiate the mediated reactions 
to produce strong oxidants Cl2, HOCl and HClO2 that play a crucial role in electrochemical 
oxidation of methomyl. Comparing with Na2SO4, use of KCl or NaCl as electrolyte was appropriate 
for the cleanup of aqueous methomyl via electrochemical oxidation.

CONCLUSIONS 
This work studied the technical feasibility and performance of electrochemical oxidation on the Pt 
electrode for the treatment of aqueous methomyl. Based on the results of electrochemical 
experiments, several concluding remarks were summarized as follows: 
y The degradation of methomyl is favorable as using concentrated electrolyte (1.0 
mol/l) in the process of electrochemical treatment. The concentration of 
electrolyte is suggested to maintain at least 1,000 times larger than the pollutant 
level for attaining the efficient removal, especially operating under an 
insufficient oxidizing potential. 
y Oxidizing potential is the determining factor for the success of the 
electrochemical treatment system. Different levels of oxidizing potential not 
only offer graded intensity of electron transfer but also initiate diverse 
electrochemical reactions to generate radicals and strong oxidants. In this work, 
the full removal of methomyl can be accomplished with the optimum oxidizing 
potential of 2.4V through electrochemical oxidation. 
y KCl and NaCl are superior to Na2SO4 to serve as electrolyte for electrochemical 
oxidation of methomyl. Due to the participation of chloride ion in chained 
electrochemical reaction, electrogenerated strong oxidants (such as Cl2, HOCl, 
and HClO2) can quickly oxidize aqueous methomyl and consequently improve 
removal efficiency. 
y Under the environment of hard water, the inhibition effect on the degradation of 
methomyl was found about 30% reduction of removal efficiency. At the 
presence of calcium carbonate, the absorbed deposit could take place on the 
working electrode. 
y Electrochemical oxidation with Pt electrodes can be successfully applied as a 
treatment process for the removal of aqueous methomyl. The degradation of 
methomyl was mainly relied on electrogenerated radicals or strong oxidants via 
the oxidation of water.
