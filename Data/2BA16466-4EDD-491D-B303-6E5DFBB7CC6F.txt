provides the means for creating 
zero-dimensional quantum structures 
without having to overcome the current 
limitations of lithography [5]. These 
self-assembled quantum dots could also 
be used to study novel device physics [6]. 
However, the reports on III-nitride devices 
with nanostructured materials are still 
very rare, photodiodes (PDs) especially 
[7-8]. In this work, we fabricated a novel 
device: nitride metal-semiconductor-metal 
(MSM) photodiodes with InGaN 
nanostructures, and characterized the 
fabricated MSM photodiodes. 
 
 
2. Experiments 
Samples used in this study were 
grown on (0001)-oriented 2-inch sapphire 
(Al2O3) substrates in a vertical 
low-pressure MOCVD reactor with a 
high-speed rotation disk. Briefly, the 
gallium, indium and nitrogen sources were 
trimethylgallium (TMGa), 
trimethylindium (TMIn), and ammonia 
(NH3), respectively. Biscyclopentadienyl 
magnesium (CP2Mg) and disilane (Si2H6) 
were used as the p-type and n-type doping 
sources, respectively. In this work, we 
have prepared three samples for the MSM 
photodiode fabrication. Sample A with 
InGaN quantum dot (QD) structures 
(2.4-nm-thick InGaN layer) was grown by 
an interrupted growth method [4]. In other 
words, we first deposited a 1.2-nm-thick 
InGaN layer, stopped the growth for 12 
seconds, and then deposited another 
1.2-nm-thick InGaN layer so as to achieve 
a 2.4-nm nominal thickness of InGaN 
layer. The 2.4-nm-thick and 100-nm-thick 
InGaN layers were directly grown on GaN 
as sample B and C, respectively. The 
schematic of the three samples are shown 
in Fig. 1. In brief, sample A, B and C are 
InGaN/GaN/sapphire (with QD structures, 
2.4-nm-thick InGaN), 
InGaN/GaN/sapphire (without QD 
structures, 2.4-nm-thick InGaN) and 
InGaN/GaN/sapphire (100-nm-thick 
InGaN), respectively.  
For comparison, MSM PDs I, II and 
III were fabricated on samples A, B and C, 
respectively. The fabrication process for 
these InGaN MSM PDs was as follows: 
Prior to the deposition of contact 
electrodes, wafers were dipped in a 
diluted hydrochloric acid water solution 
(HCl : H2O = 1 : 1) for 3 min to remove 
native oxides. A Ni layer was 
subsequently deposited onto the sample 
surface using an e-gun evaporator to serve 
as the metal contact. Standard lithography 
and etching were then performed to define 
the interdigitated contact pattern. Finally, 
Au layers were then deposited on top of 
the contact electrodes to serve as bonding 
pads. The fingers of the contact electrodes 
are 13 μm wide and 146 μm long with 
spacing of 8 μm. The active area of the 
whole device is defined by 146×146 μm2. 
A Solver scanning near-field optical 
microscope (SNOM) system based on 
inverted optical microscope was employed 
in this measurement. Note that the SNOM 
operation includes four measuring modes: 
reflection (probe induces the light on the 
surface, special objective reflection mode 
with the use of inverted microscope 
optical scheme), transmission, shear-force 
and luminescence. The near-field light 
source is gas Ar+ laser (total output power: 
150mW) with multi lines of : 
514nm/55mW, 488nm/55mW, 
476nm/7mW, 465nm/7mW, 457nm/5mW. 
The surface characterization 
measurements were performed in 
reflection and shear-force modes at room 
temperature. 
An HP-4155B semiconductor 
parameter analyzer was then used to 
measure the current-voltage (I-V) 
characteristics of these MSM PDs in the 
dark current could operate in the normal 
incidence mode; we could achieve a much 
larger photocurrent to dark current 
contrast ratio from MSM photodiodes 
with nanoscale InGaN SAQDs. It was also 
found that the measured responsivity of 
MSM PDs (PD I with QDs and PD III 
without QDs) approximated to the same in 
the range of 390 - 460 nm. Furthermore, 
the photodiodes with QDs showed the 
higher spectral response than that of the 
photodiodes without QDs at wavelength 
ranges of < 350 nm and > 480 nm.
