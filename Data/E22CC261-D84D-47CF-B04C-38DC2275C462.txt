Abstract 
The objective of the project entitled “Scenario Design and Power/Control Module Development for 
Urban Intelligent Electric Vehicles” aims to develop key technologies and industrial designs for the 
eventual realization of intelligent light-weight electrical vehicles and the associated transportation 
environment. Future urban transportation vehicles are likely to integrate electric-driven, green and clean, 
satellite navigation, communication, light-weight, and intelligent techniques. the project develops 
inductive coupling power transfer, efficient power management, intelligent control, coordinated guidance, 
scenario analysis, and vehicle design techniques. In the second year, the Contactless Power Transfer 
System and high efficiency power management technology are developed in this project. To combine 
with the latest couple structure and developed from the structure of the first year, the Contactless Power 
Transfer energy charging System is thus structured. The fuel cell based experimental platform and the 
                                                                       共 11 頁  第  4 頁 
境。為達此一目的，本計畫以「隨選供電」 (power on demand)，「智能在身」 (car with brain)，「彈
指即至」 (move as planned) 以及「綠能我行」 (eco, BUXI can) 為四大特點。隨選供電旨在提供
載具多樣的電源供應選擇 [1]。智能在身植入電腦軟硬體技術於載具並大幅度應用智慧型控制與推
論技術以增進載具之自動化程度。彈指即至強調使用此一載具之便利性以及行動之流暢性，主要
藉由感測裝置之融合、通訊機制之佈放、交通資訊與行動意圖之分享使行動不再是一個負擔。綠
能我行則由載具之潔能、旅次之精簡以及交通流量之優化合力建構出優質且潔能之運輸環境。 
三、 研究方法 
為達上述目地，本計畫「都會區智慧型電動載具之應用情境設計與電控模組發展」發展相關
之設計概念與關鍵技術。整個研究計畫分五項子計畫進行，目前在第二年執行往整合的方向進行，
由李嘉猷副教授主持的「都會區潔能輕型電動車用非接觸式感應饋電軌道系統之研究」與梁從主
教授主持的子計畫二「智慧型輕量化移動載具高效率電源管理系統」逐步進行整合，朝向潔能技
術的目標前往，而李祖聖教授主持的子計畫三「智慧型控制晶片之設計與研製」與莊智清教授主
持的子計畫四「異質移動載具協同導引之研究」則往智慧型技術整合，在於導航與車輛控制與通
訊與感測器資訊作結合。而馬敏元副教授主持的子計畫五「未來都會載具之設計」則繼續為載具
之介面與使用情境發展，並且結合其他單項技術作介面整合與使用者情境設計。以下針對各子計
畫之研究方法與部分結果進行說明。 
3.1 「都會區潔能輕型電動車用非接觸式感應饋電軌道系統之研究」 
由於感應線圈之型式與結構，影響饋電性能甚鉅，故須先就感應線圈之特性予以分析，設計
出最適用於本感應饋電系統者，並對其特性加以量測建立出必要之參數，然後用來完成其等效電
路模型，俾以研製非接觸式感應饋電系統。研究項目尚包含高功率非接觸式感應供電機構之特性
分析及設計、線性軌道型感應線圈之分析及設計、最大感應耦合發生結構設計、量測最大感應距
離與移動速度之限制、實現高效率感應電能傳輸品質、負載電壓回授控制與供電軌道間雙向訊號
傳遞電路設計等。如圖一為初級側整體系統實體電路圖，其中電路包含 Class E 驅動電路、變頻控
制電路、單晶片控制電路、初級側供電平台、降壓與整流電路。如圖二為次級側整體系統實體電
路圖，其包含切換電容、Tri-Port 變壓器、橋式整流器、單晶片控制電路、雙向充放電轉換器、雙
向全橋變流器、輸出端回授判斷電路、穩壓電路及鉛酸電池。

3.2 「智慧型輕量化移動載具高效率電源管理系統」 
電源管理系統為智慧型輕量化移動載具之一關鍵技術。本計畫之目標除了發展智慧型高效率
之電源管理系統[2]之外，在燃料電池供電與高性能 DC/DC 轉換器的部分，亦發展 DC/DC 轉換器
由燃料電驅動電動載具的馬達[3]。本子項關鍵技術提出一新型交錯式昇降壓轉換器(Interleaved 
buck-boost converter) 作為燃料電池(Fuel cell)後級穩壓及能量傳送用途，如圖九所示。本轉換器的
電壓增益是傳統昇降壓轉換器(Buck-boost converter)的兩倍，其電壓增益曲線圖如圖十所示。紅色
實線為本轉換器之增益曲線，藍色虛線為傳統昇降壓轉換器之增益曲線。此外，本轉換器所採用
的交錯式架構可有效降低輸出電流漣波。此架構之半導體元件 S1 與 D1 須承受較大的電流電壓應
力，但以目前的電子製程技術來說，此問題已經可以被克服。

證，目的在有效分析與協調移動載具之行為[4]，使交通狀況與潔能減碳達到最佳化，達到用路人
與環境雙贏之目的。本技術設計一類樹狀圖(Dendrogram)之方法來找尋最短之路徑。不同於 Dijkstra
的方法，本子項關鍵技術將地圖上之交通網絡建立，在每個交會點給予編號(ni)並且存成矩陣形
式。如圖十五，該模擬係以國立成功大學自強校區內之道路為模擬交通網路，將每個片段道路之
交會點設為一個節點，再由上述之程序計算最短路徑。設定節點 8 為貣始點，節點 2 為目的地，
經由 Matlab 軟體模擬，可得到圖十六之電腦模擬結果。表一則實際將有可能之最短路徑之路徑總
長列表比較。可清楚觀察得知，所推算出來之路徑為該區域之最短路徑。

3.5 「未來都會載具之設計」 
未來都會載具設計著重在使用者與未來都會區智慧型載具之間的互動方式，如圖十八人機介
面所示。在此分為第一介面與第二介面，第一介面：使用者與操作端方面的互動介面；第二介面：
操作端與載具的驅動系統間互動介面。 
由圖十七可以得知，操作端負責了重要的任務， 需要符合使用者使用操作上的習慣與認知，
並將使用者操作動作轉化成機器所能運作的指令，加以驅動載具。操作端以較具創作自由度的軟

四、 結果與討論 
本研究計畫「都會區智慧型電動載具之應用情境設計與電控模組發展」主要著眼於如何結合
工業設計概念與電機控制技術以發展出符合未來生活情境之都會區移動載具。本年度經整個團隊
之通力合作與充分討論目前勾勒四大執行重點為「隨選供電」，「智能在身」，「彈指即至」以及「綠
能我行」。於此一原則下，第二年之執行結果主要歸納如下： 
a. 完成移動載具實驗平台之修改。在燃料電池的實驗與自動駕駛的測試上有相當的便捷性。 
b. 建立非接觸感應電能傳輸系統。除提高感應式充電之效率與功率外，可透過非接觸式供電
技術後級 Tri-port 電路選擇對於負載供電或者對於電池充電。 
c. 發展燃料電池之 DC/DC 轉換器電路之設計與製作。設計新型交錯式 buck-boost converter
以穩定燃料電池之輸出，除了電壓有效地轉換成各子系統所需之電力規格，並可透過
DC/DC 轉換器使用燃料電池為動力在校園內行駛。 
d. 發展智慧型路徑跟隨控制器之發展。使用智慧型控制器控制實驗載具移動與轉向，並設計
一控制介面並連接感測器，除了可得知目前路況外亦可透過介面控制車輛動態。 
e. 分析單一載具動態與異質移動載具系統之動態分析與模擬。並實現路徑規畫模擬，透過計
算車流量與車流密度運算出最短路徑與最短時間之路線。 
f. 歸納以「仁」為思考中心。分析消費者使用型態，進而設計與規劃載具人機介面「以達彈
指」即至之目標。 
電動載具係一高度整合之系統就技術面而言牽涉驅動馬達與控制，儲能與電源管理，高功率
電力電子晶片，嵌入式電腦，行動通訊，衛星導航，輕量化材料，傳動電控空調煞車單元，外觀
內裝設計等。另一方面，整個電動載具產業之發展亦與環保政策、充電設施等息息相關。本計畫
之執行目前擇定四項重點，期望藉由整個團隊之努力持續精進以有效落實與移轉技術。

Abstract 
 
The FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC mission, launched in 2006, is a joint Taiwan–US mission for meteorological, 
climatological, ionospheric, and geodetic studies. The system consists of a constellation of six LEO 
satellites, each equipped with GPS receivers for radio occultation (RO) experiment. In the past three 
years, the system has successfully provided a significant amount of RO data in a uniformly distributed 
manner, in both location and time, for better modeling of climate model, forecasting of whether, and 
monitoring of ionosphere. Since the QZSS signals are fully compatible and interoperable with GPS 
signals, the launch of QZSS first satellite poses an opportunity for the existing FORMOSAT-3 satellites 
to obtain more the occultation profiles and more scientific return. In the presentation, the 
FORMOSAT-3 program will be briefly reviewed, the effects of QZSS on the RO mission will be assessed, 
and a campaign for observing QZSS signals will be discussed.

此些演講均將目前控制界所研討之部分重要議題進行闡述並引領出一些研究方
向。除專題演講外，大會並安排論文發表之議程與海報張貼之互動議程。同一時
段計有十八場論文發表議程以平行方式進行，共計有 162場論文發表議程。海報
張貼議程則計有 42 場。除此之外尚有一些展覽、工業界互動與訓練議程。整體
的會議安排相當緊湊，議程主題之涵蓋亦相當多元。 
 
本次會議本人與學生共同發表「An Evolutionary Space Search Algorithm (ESSA) 
for Global Numerical Optimization」論文，主要提出一種以量子計算為基礎之計算
方法用以進行數值問題之優化，此一方法適用於不可微分且具多個局部最佳解函
數之優化。論文同時利用數值分析驗證所提方法之優點。 
 
由於近年來兩岸控制界之交流漸漸頻繁，故本次會議亦與中國大陸之一些控
制領域學者進行交流，不論是整體控制發展之趨勢乃至於實際控制議題之討論或
後續合作機會之開創等均有所討論。一般而言，中國大陸之控制學者理論之訓練
均有相當紮實之基礎因此研究之質量相當不錯；再加上近年來大力吸引世界各國
之有名學者前往講學故對於研究方向之掌握與新穎題目之開啟均漸有成果。我國
之控制領域人才相對而言較重實務，對於解決實用問題或進行成果展示有不錯之
表現。但長遠而言，如何進一步深化應是值得探討之議題。 
 
本次會議感謝國科會計畫補助相關費用。本報告附所發表之論文補充說明。

manipulations reveal that the relationship between the thj  
subgroup in the thi  group and the thk  subspace satisfies 
 2mk i j= + −  (2) 
for 1 2 2 1n mk≤ ≤ − + . 
A salient feature of the overlapping strategy is that each 
subspace is referenced by a mixture of pointers: group and 
subgroup. Indeed, the thk  subspace is referred to by the 
( )2 1 thm j− +  subgroup in the ( )1 thk j+ −  group for 
j =1, 2, ..., 2m . Hence, in the feasible space, each 
subspace corresponds to 2m  pairs of groups and 
subgroups. The selection probability for each subspace is 
calculated by the product of the selection probabilities of 
the groups and the subgroups. 
B. Representation 
Quantum bits which differ from traditional bits, use the 
probability method to represent binary codes and can thus 
manipulate combinations of optimization problems [13, 15]. 
Group and subgroup selection is characterized by quantum 
bits. More precisely, the quantum bit individual gQ  that 
represents 2n  group probabilities is defined as 
 
1 2 n
⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦"g g g gQ α α α  (3) 
where n  is a positive integer that represents the number 
of quantum bits in gQ , 0 1h≤ ≤gα , h =1, 2, ..., n . 
Additionally, the quantum bit individual isQ  representing 
the probabilities of 2m  subgroup in the thi  group is 
defined as 
 
1 2 m
i i i i⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦"s s s sQ α α α  (4) 
where m  is a positive integer of the number of the 
quantum bits in sQ , 0 1g
i≤ ≤sα , g =1, 2, ..., m , i =1, 
2, ..., 2n . 
Figure 2 depicts the structure of quantum bit individuals. 
Each group is characterized by a quantum bit individual 
gQ , and each subgroup is characterized by a quantum bit 
sQ . A combination of gQ  and sQ  thus points to a 
subspace in the feasible solution space. 
Within each subspace specified in (1), a real number kµ , 
k =1, 2, ..., 2 2 1n m− +  is randomly tested for fitness. The 
real number in the thk  subspace thus satisfies 
 ( )
2 2 1 2 2 1k n m n m
u l u lk l l k l− −⎡ ⎤∈ × − + × +⎢ ⎥− + − +⎣ ⎦µ  (5) 
C. Selection 
This section explains how gQ  and sQ  are used to 
determine groups and subgroups, respectively. 
1) Group selection: For gQ  with n  quantum bits, 
generate a random vector 
1 2 n
⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦"g g g gr r r r  where 
0 1
h
≤ ≤gr . The corresponding bit hgb  takes “1” if 
2
h h
≤g gr α  or “0” otherwise for h =1, 2, ..., n . The binary 
string 
1 2 n
⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦"g g g gb b b b  is then converted to a decimal 
string. The chosen thi  group can be represented by 
 1i = +gd  (6) 
where gd  is the decimal positive integer associated with 
gb . 
2) Subgroup selection: When gQ  selects the 
thi  group, 
the subgroup in isQ  is then determined as follows. For 
i
sQ  
with m  quantum bits, generate a random vector 
ThC15.3
5769
binary string that represents the ( )12 thm k− +  group (i.e., 
gb ) is updated to BESTgb ; consequently, the selection 
probability of the ( )12 thm k− +  group increases in 
subsequent operations. 
2) Update of 
12m k− +
BESTsb : To enhance the opportunity to 
correspond to the thk  subspace when again selecting the 
( )12 thm k− +  group, the binary string that represents the 
( )12 thm−  subgroup in the ( )12 thm k− +  group (i.e., 12m k− +sb ) 
is updated to 
12m k− +
BESTsb . 
3) Update of i BESTsb : Similarly, the current binary string 
that the isQ  generates (i.e., 
i
sb ) is updated to 
i
BESTsb . 
4) Update of kµ : When a better solution in the thk  
subspace is found, the mean kµ  in the subspace is 
substituted for solution x  in future searches. 
E. Exchange Operation 
In ESSA, all populations of gQ  and sQ ={
1
sQ , 
2
sQ , ..., 
2n
sQ } are periodically exchanged. The period of exchange 
is a design parameter, and the exchange process can 
potentially induce a variation in the selection probabilities 
of the groups and subgroups. If an exchange period is 
satisfied, the exchange operation in ESSA is defined as a 
process of exchanging all gQ  and sQ  among different 
populations. In ESSA, the exchange operation is realized 
by a process of interchange among populations so that 
populations consider the selection probabilities that other 
populations evolve under their own BESTgb  and sBESTb . If 
no better solutions are found after completing an exchange 
operation, gQ  and sQ  gradually evolve toward BESTgb  
and sBESTb , respectively. Therefore, the whole process is 
similar to migrating and searching for optimal solutions 
among different populations. 
F. ESSA for Numerical Optimization 
Having discussed the representation and operation of the 
ESSA, the steps of the ESSA can be written as follows. 
Step 1) Initialize gQ , sQ ={
1
sQ , 
2
sQ , ..., 
2n
sQ }, 
BESTgb , BESTsb ={
1
BESTsb , 
2
BESTsb , ..., 
2n
BESTsb } 
and µ ={ 1µ , 2µ , ..., 2 2 1n m− +µ }. 
Step 2) Generate the binary strings gb  from gQ  
using the random number vector 
1 2 n
⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦"g g g gr r r r . 
Step 3) Convert gb  to decimal positive integer gd  
and obtain the thi  group. 
Step 4) Generate the binary strings isb  from 
i
sQ  
using the random number vector 
1 2 m
⎡ ⎤= ⎣ ⎦"s s s sr r r r . 
Step 5) Convert isb  to decimal positive integer sd  
and obtain the thj  subgroup. 
Step 6) Obtain the thk  subspace according to the thj  
subgroup in the thi  group.  
Step 7) In the selected subspace, generate a Gaussian 
random number x  with mean kµ  and 
variance 2σ . 
Step 8) Evaluate the fitness value. 
Step 9) If generation=1, then store the fitness value into 
BEST_FITNESS and return to Step 2). 
Otherwise, go to Step 10). 
Step 10) Evaluate the fitness value. 
  (a) If fitness value ≥ BEST_FITNESS: 
— update gQ  and 
i
sQ . 
  (b) If fitness value < BEST_FITNESS: 
— Store the fitness value into 
BEST_FITNESS. 
— Update BESTgb . 
— Update 
12m k− +
BESTsb . 
— Update iBESTsb . 
— Update kµ  and store x  into BESTx . 
Step 11) If the termination condition is satisfied, then go 
to Step 14). Otherwise, go to Step 12). 
Step 12) If the exchange condition is satisfied, then go to 
Step 13). Otherwise, return to Step 2). 
Step 13) Exchange gQ  and sQ  in all populations and 
return to Step 2). 
Step 14) Choose BESTx  as the best solution and 
BEST_FITNESS as the best fitness value. 
III. NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
To verify the feasibility of the ESSA and to demonstrate 
its applicability to other problems, the ESSA was used to 
solve ten different benchmark functions with varying 
complexity. The function definitions can be found in [10]. 
Except for sphF , the analyzed functions are multimodal, 
and they represent the most difficult class of problems for 
many optimization algorithms. In the experiments, the 
population size was set to 30, ∆θ  = 0.05π , ε =0.995, 
τ =0.995, and 2σ  is 0.0001 times the subspace width. 
The selection of the exchange period is determined mainly 
by functional complexity. In this study, exchange period 
was 50 for schF  ; 100 for sphF , ackF , rasF , salF , whtF , 
1pnF  and 2pnF ; and 300 for rosF  and grwF . 
Table I lists the parameters of the quantum bit numbers 
in gQ  (i.e., n ) and sQ  (i.e., m ) and the resulting 
performance metrics for optimizing the ten analyzed 
ThC15.3
5771
representation proves superior to other representations [13]. 
Therefore, a large population size is unnecessary when 
applying ESSA. This finding is confirmed by the data in 
Table IV, which tabulates the average performance metrics 
of ESSA in fifty optimization runs of the ten analyzed 
benchmark functions with dimension 50 when the 
population sizes are 15, 30, and 50. As the termination 
condition is set in terms of completing 500000 NFEs, the 
scheme with more populations evolves with a less number 
of generations. In the table, the lowest MFVs among the 
three population selections are highlighted in bold type. 
Clearly, a large population does not render a smaller MFV. 
Actually, as the quantum bit representation already offers 
some diversity, the population size selected by applying 
ESSA can be smaller than the dimension of the function to 
be optimized. As a result, the overall computational 
complexity is kept within an acceptable range. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
This work presents an ESSA for solving global 
numerical optimization problems. The primary difference 
between the proposed ESSA and other optimization 
algorithms is that ESSA searches the optimal solution by 
finding the correct subspace. This partitioning and 
multi-tier overlapping representation strategy finds the 
correct subspace with reduced risk of being trapped at a 
local optimum. The performance and effectiveness of the 
ESSA are further demonstrated in its optimization of ten 
benchmark functions of diverse complexities. In summary, 
the characteristics of the ESSA are as follows. 
1. The ESSA searches the optimal solution by finding 
the optimal subspace, which reduces overall 
computational complexity and the risk of being 
trapped at a local optimum is mitigated. 
2. The overlapping strategy in subspace reference also 
prevents the ESSA from premature convergence. 
3. Through quantum bit representations and operations, 
the ESSA determines the correct subspace with a 
sufficient diversity at the exploration stage. 
4. When the subspace is determined, the ESSA attempts 
to find the numerical solution via a random search in 
which the mean and variance are further adjusted in 
accordance with the search result. 
5. Some design flexibilities are offered by the ESSA in 
terms of parameter selection to better match the 
performance of the algorithm with the underlying 
problem. Generally, a small population can be used. 
The number of quantum bits depends on the 
complexity and nature of the objective function. 
This work demonstrates that the proposed method is 
superior to existing algorithms. In the future, further 
analyses of the ESSA are needed to further develop the 
adaptive ESSA to improve parameter selection by the 
proposed algorithm.

Abstract—In this paper, simulation and experimental studies are performed to analyze the design of a light electric 
vehicle (LEV) that is equipped with fuel cell. For future clean and green electric vehicles, the incorporation of fuel cell 
technologies is regarded as a promising design alternative. The fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen in the air to 
generate electricity and H2O. It, however, has two drawbacks, one is that the power output of fuel cell may be subject to 
instability and the other is that the power of instantaneous discharge of fuel cell is not sufficiently high. Moreover, the 
cost of hydrogen is still high nowadays. In this work, a hybrid structure of power system in which the electric power 
system is augmented with fuel cell is adopted. The fuel cell is considered as the dominative power and the lithium-Iron 
battery is used as the auxiliary power. The purpose is to design a power management system to coordinate the generation 
of power from the two different sources in anticipating various needs. 
Keywords—Fuel Cell ,  Lithium-Iron  Battery, simulink, LEV 
 
1. Introduction 
As the concern for global warming grew and the 
shortage of natural sources of energy continues, oil and air 
pollution worsens, the importance of subjects such as 
“Green” or “Eco-Friendly” is on the rise.  Therefore, with 
the advantage of economizing fuel uses, environmental-
friendly, no exhaust emission, electric vehicles have 
evolved as important solutions for the next generation 
transportation system. Fuel cells due to their benefits in 
high energy efficient and low pollutant emission are 
expected to fulfill the power needs for future vehicles.   In 
the paper, simulation and experimental studies are 
performed to analyze the design of a light electric vehicle 
(LEV) that is equipped with fuel cell. The study uses 
Simulink to simulate proton exchange membrane (PEM) 
fuel cell and Lithium-Iron battery hybrid vehicular power 
system. Due to the instability of output voltage by the fuel 
cell, a high efficiency DC/DC converter is used to stabilize 
the output voltage and assist Lithium-Iron battery to 
enhance the power generation capability. The design of the 
power management system under different circumstances 
is also investigated. For verification, a light electric 
vehicle (LEV) prototype is employed to compare the 
simulation and experimental results. 
 
Previously, simulation studies for fuel cell based vehicle 
power control have been studied in [1, 2, 3]. In [4, 5, 6], 
the stability of fuel cell output interleaved buck-boost 
converter have been analyzed. In the paper, a demo "Fuel 
Cell Vehicle (FCV) Power Train" model is adopted for the 
establishment of the simulation model of the combined 
fuel-cell, DC/DC converter, and vehicle dynamics. An 
LEV is employed to provide experimental data so that the 
simulation analysis can be correlated with the experiment. 
The goal of the study is to provide a comprehensive model 
for the design of hybrid power converter and power 
management system when both fuel cell and battery are 
utilized. In Section 2, the simulation of the LEV and fuel 
cell is described. Simulation results are also provided. In 
Section 3, experimental results are provided and compared 
with the simulation results. In Section 4, some concluding 
remarks are given.   
 
 2.Simulation of LEV and Fuel Cell  
2.1  Experimental platform and Fuel Cell 
In the study of the hybrid LEV, the 1.5KW fuel cell is 
used for the major power of LEV. A 24V60Ah Lithium-
Iron Battery is also used as the auxiliary power of LEV. 
Due to the voltage stablility of the fuel cell, a DC-DC 
converter is applied to stabilize the quality of output 
voltage from fuel cell. After passing through the converter, 
the 24V DC bus could supply the power to drive the 
1.5KW motor of LEV. Figure 1 shows the architecture of 
power system.

Figure 7: The actions of the elements inside the interleaved 
buck-boost converter 
In Figure 7, there are four modes in one period of 
triggering the circuit. Because the first two modes are 
equivalent to the last two, the first and second mode is 
analyzed and the overall actions could be comprehensibly.  
Mode 1(t0~t1): 
The equivalent circuit of mode 1 is shown in figure 8(a). 
Since the switch S1 and S2 are connected, S3 is cut-off. The 
input energy is stored by inductor L1 via the switch S1and 
S2 are connected and the input energy and inductor L2 
could output the energy to the load through the switch S1 
and diode D3, simultaneously. 
Mode 2 (t1~t2)： 
The equivalent circuit of mode 1 is shown in figure 8(b). 
In this mode, the switch S1, S2 and S3 are all cut-off and 
the load can obtain the energy from the inductor L1 via 
two flywheel diode D1 and D2. At the same time, the 
inductor L2 is continuous to output the energy to the load 
through the diode D1and D3.

2.2 Simulations 
In this paper, the Matlab/simulink is employed to 
analyze the performance of LEV. The simulation of the 
power management subsystem of the LEV is shown in 
Figure 9. In our simulations, three parts are required. The 
command is transmitted to the LEV electrical subsystem 
of fuel cell and DC-DC converter from the energy 
management subsystem to generate the torque of motor. 
According to the value of torque of motor, the speed of 
LEV Vehicle and the rotation rate of motor could be 
estimated.

the actually test value, we could use the method of 
simulation to enhance the understanding of the power 
generation mechanism, fuel cell control strategy, and the 
integration of hybrid power sources in a vehicle when the 
latter is subject to acceleration and brake. In the future, 
additional calibrations will be conducted to provide better 
correlation between the simulation and experimental 
results. Power control and management strategies will also 
be developed based on the simulation model to achieve 
better efficiency and operational safety.

Abstract—The paper presents an intelligent light electric vehicle (LEV) that is developed based on sensor fusion 
system to achieve the functions of self path planning and navigation, autonomous driving, and collision warning in the 
so-called “last mile” service scenario. The LEV is designed to have a function of auto driving by using fuzzy control 
strategy. Two modes of path planning method are proposed and the planning efficiency is illustrated via computer 
simulations. The collision warning system is also considered to help the driver or auto driving system to ensure the safety 
of driver and pedestrians. The performances of sensor fusion system are shown through the computer simulations. 
Keywords—Sensor Fusion, Path Planning, Collision Warning, Light Electric Vehicle. 
 
1. Introduction 
In twenty-first century, the automatic driving technique 
is important for developing the transportation. A 
convenient, comfortable and reliable transporter is the goal 
that many engineers want to accomplish. However, most 
of unmanned transporter nowadays is operated for a crowd 
of people, e.g. metro, trains, etc. Because the maneuver of 
small-scale vehicle is flexible than large-scale transporter 
and the urban traffic is complicated than the railway, the 
small-scale unmanned vehicle should be developed more 
intelligent to overcome the complex situation. Hence, a 
reliable unmanned small-scale transporter, which is 
designed for less than five person use is realized rarely 
today. The objective of this paper is to develop a light 
unmanned vehicle (LEV) based on sensor fusion system to 
have the functions of self path planning and navigation, 
autonomous driving, collision avoidance, and so on for 
“last mile” service scenario. 
For an intelligent unmanned vehicle design, two of the 
major researches about autonomous vehicles are the road-
following and collision avoidance problems [11], [14]. 
Some results about vehicle control using a guiding 
mechanism such as radar have also been proposed [1]. 
Additionally, predictive techniques are being developed in 
order to allow advanced modeling and comparison with 
historical baseline data. To accomplish the missions such 
as car autonomous driving, the position and orientation of 
the vehicle is measured utilizing INS, and collision 
prevention is performed utilizing laser rangefinder. In 
order to obtain the position data more accurately, a sensor 
fusion system with fuzzy logic based Kalman filter is 
employed [12]. And a fuzzy logic controller is designed to 
control the velocity and the steering of the vehicle. 
However, an unmanned LEV maneuvers in the urban 
traffic network is relied upon an effective path that is 
scheduled by efficient path planning algorithm. A class of 
single-source path planning has been studied for more than 
half century, the Dijkstra algorithm [5], is the most 
popular method and is applied generally for shortest path 
planning. The Dijkstra algorithm employed the concept of 
tree of minimum total length. Each branches will be 
impose on given weightings to compose of weighted graph. 
The minimum path is computed according to minimize an 
objective function, so called target weighting function. 
However, eight steps of iterative procedure of Dijkstra 
algorithm that is designed to calculate the target weighting 
function is computing consumption since the number of 
branches is increased. It is not efficient enough to plan the 
path for urban LEV. Accordingly, a relaxed technique is 
proposed to reduce the iterative procedure of Dijkstra 
algorithm [2]. But the relaxed method might misjudge the 
shortest path if the path consists of a large number of 
segments. Other single-source shortest path planning 
method had been proposed to improve the efficiency of 
Dijkstra algorithm, e.g. Bellman-Ford algorithm [7], 
Floyd-Warshall [9], etc. In this paper, a Dendrogram-like 
path planning method is proposed. Unlike the Dijkstra 
algorithm, our proposed path planning method is 
represented in a matrix, which records the relationship 
among several nodes. After comparing the length of 
planned paths, the minimum path could be determined.  
Because the LEV is developed based on “last mile” 
service scenario, it is high probability to be operated in 
metropolitan. Therefore, a reliable collision warning 
system plays an important role to ensure the safety of 
driver and pedestrians. Unlike the Volvo city safety 
system [6], [10], the collision risk indicator (CRI) [15] is 
employed to develop the collision warning system in this 
paper. This collision warning system provides an alarm for 
driver to decrease the probability of bumping into vehicles 
or pedestrians. By integrating the information from lane 
keeping controller, navigation system, and collision 
warning signals simultaneously, the sensor fusion system 
can make a control strategy to operate the LEV traveling 
on the desired path. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a 
kinematic model of LEV is described in the mathematical 
formulation. In section 3, an automatic driving system, 
navigation control, two modes of path planning strategies, 
and collision warning system are integrated via sensor 
fusion system. In the following section, applying the 
sensor fusion system in section 3, the LEV had been 
operated and traveled on the trajectories that are given 
through path planning strategies. Computer simulation

In our study, the property of differential flatness [4], [8], 
[13] that is inherent in the kinematical models of 
unmanned vehicle is employed in the trajectories tracking 
control. Consider the mathematical model in (1), the flat 
outputs is able to be defined as:

Note that the relationship between flat outputs and inputs 
are singular that means the control input ω cannot be

where nij represents that the total number of vehicles in 
section lij (kilometer). If the density of traffic is increased, 
the density-weighting is increasing also. For the second 
situation, a turning-weighting tjω is imposed on the 
trajectory due to the vehicle encounters a corner and tjω is a 
given constant. If the angle of the corner is greater, the 
turning-weighting is increasing. The illustration of 
minimum-time path planning is shown in figure 5. Every 
sections and cusps are given the weightings. Since the 
weightings are counted, the minimum-time path can be 
scheduled and the algorithm is summarized as follows:  
Step 1. Construct the network. The first step is similar to 
the method of shortest-path planning. Mark the nodes and 
construct the network in advance. 
Step 2. Compute the weightings. According to the traffic 
flow and the connective angle between two trajectories, 
the density-weighting dijω can be estimated by (16) and 
turning-weighting tjω is given. 
Step 3. Determine the initial position and destination. The 
desired initial position and destination are specified. 
Step 4. Figure out the path. In Step 1, the possible path 
from initial position to the terminal can be scheduled. In 
this step, the trajectories are multiplied by the weightings, 
such that

where m is the number of planning path,Ω is the set of 
trajectories and since the vehicle moves from node i to j, 
the suffix i is replaces by j and the suffix j will be changed 
to the next neighbor node until j f= .  
Step 5. Choose the minimum-time path. After calculating 
mη , the minimum value of mη represents the least time 
consuming. Thus, the set of path of { }min mη is chosen to 
be the minimum-time path.

3.3 Collision Warning System 
 
Figure 6: Illustration of CRI 
 
Collision warning system is developed to ensure the 
safety of driver and pedestrians and is also considered for 
the safety driving of unmanned vehicle in our study. Two 
cases are considered in this paper. The first case is 
assumed that the vehicles and pedestrians all have the 
dedicated short range communication device to share the 
position, velocity, acceleration, and so on. After receiving 
the information, the related distance, velocity, and angle 
could be estimated between our vehicle and other vehicles 
or pedestrians. Hence, the warning system can give an 
alarm to the driver to avoid the dangers or provide a 
warning message for auto control unit to maintain the 
safety of vehicle. In our study, the collision risk indicator 
(CRI) method is employed for collision warning. By 
modifying the formulation of CRI in [15] slightly, the 
collision warning index could be represented as: 
21010 logw
b c
C
r t
⎛ ⎞= × ⎜ ⎟×⎝ ⎠
                       (18) 
where (meter)br is the boundary radius of circle which 
touches extension line of relative speed and (second)ct  
represents the estimated collision time until the vehicular 
collisions. Obviously, the smaller br  and ct are the higher 
the risk becomes and the illustration of CRI warning is 
shown in figure 6. 
The second case is assumed that the vehicles or 
pedestrians do not have any dedicated short range 
communication device to share any information to each 
other. In such situation, a short range and wide area 
detective instrument is relied only for our collision 
avoidance system. A laser measurement system is 
efficiently to tackle over this situation. 
3.4 Sensor Fusion Control System 
The objective is to design an intelligent control strategy 
that can guide the vehicle travels on the trajectory of user’s 
decision. The first consideration of the control procedure 
is to ensure the safety of driver and pedestrians. The 
second is the automatic control law that can keep the 
vehicle maneuver in the lane exactly and the last 
consideration is about the path that is chosen by user. By 
integrating the aforementioned messages, the control 
strategy could be summarized and shown into the control

and assess the traveling time during the path. For testing 
the collision warning system, the value of CRI is utilized 
to judge the danger around the vehicle. Figure 13 
illustrates that the circle represents the initial position of 
LEV, rectangular is the destination of LEV, and asters are 
the node that can broadcast the position to LEV. The LEV 
moving abides by the direction of arrows. Figure 14 shows 
the simulation results collision warning system by using of 
CRI. The value is greater, the situation is more dangerous. 
The node 4 is located near by the lane, the simulation 
results in Figure 14 shows the CRI is higher than others. 
The computer simulations show the efficiency of the 
proposed methodologies for navigation and safety driving 
of unmanned LEVs.

5. Conclusions 
In this paper, a sensor fusion system for the achievement 
of the functions of auto-driving, navigation, collision 
warning, and path-planning is developed for an LEV. The 
fuzzy controller is used to construct the auto-driving 
system that can keep the LEV move on the lane. For path 
planning, shortest-path planning and minimum-time path
