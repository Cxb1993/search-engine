1. Introduction 
 
Given an optimization criterion and a set of customers (demand centers) with known 
demands, the location-allocation (LA) problem is to select the locations of a number of supply 
centers to serve customers, and to decide the corresponding allocation of the customers to supply 
centers.  The recent rapid growth of demand for supply chain management, which can decrease 
the total cost, while improve the quality of goods and services of various organizations, has 
drawn significant research attention.  As an important part of supply chain management, the 
LA problem is related to the facility management service, logistics and distribution, order entry 
and customer service operations.  Therefore, it should be indicated much more than before for 
organizations to improve their competitive advantage [1].  
In solving the LA problem, the costs of transportation between customers and supply 
centers are proportional to an appropriately determined distance (e.g. the Euclidean or rectilinear 
distance).  The location of supply centers and the allocation of customers to supply centers 
must be considered simultaneously.  The capacities of supply centers in LA problems can either 
be fixed or treated without any limitation if the capacity of each supply center can be adjusted 
according to the amount of allocated service demands of customers, which are referred to as 
capacitated and uncapacitated problems, respectively.  In this research, in order to tackle the 
problem arising in the context of a large number of urban location problems and facilities 
location problems within a factory [2,3], the rectilinear distance is adopted for distance 
measurement and the criterion is to minimize the total weighted distances between supply 
centers and customers.  The following formulation is used to illustrate this kind of problem:

  planar coordinate  system; 
 wj=(aj,bj), j=1,…,M, are M unknown points, representing locations of supply  
  centers, and can be located anywhere on the planar coordinate system; 
 Di, i=1,..,N, are the frequency of service demands per unit time for N  
  customers;

ALA is a simple iteration procedure.  Start with an initial set of suppliers (W), allocate 
each customer to the closest supply center (yielding C), and then recalculate the locations of 
supply centers (W).  By using new locations of suppliers, customers are re-allocated (C).  This 
( ) cycle is repeated until the allocation or cost in two successive iterations 
remains unchanged.  Comparing to popular overall methods (e.g. genetic algorithms and 
simulated annealing methods), ALA method have great advantage of fast convergency.  By 
integrating the merge-split scheme into a modified ALA based method proposed by Hsieh and 
Tien[15], a new merge-split ALA (MSALA) algorithm can be constructed with both fast 
convergency and efficient escaping from local minima. 
...WCW →→
The main ideas of the modified ALA method proposed by Hsieh and Tien[15] can be briefly 
illustrated by a plan of three levels of efficient adjustments of allocations of customers as well as 
locations of supply centers. These three levels of adjustments are listed below. 
Level 1―adjustment of a customer: given a cluster, the nearest outside customer, who is 
determined by the distance between the supply center of given cluster and the outside 
customer, is included into the given cluster. 
Level 2―djustment of the location of a supply center: given a cluster, the supply center is 
move to the next candidate location along one of the four directions, right, left, upper or 
lower. 
Level 3―brutal updating new obtained solution for the subsequent iterations regardless of 
the improvement. 
Normally, the search process utilizes level 1 adjustment only.  Level 2 adjustment is 
triggered for reinforcement if a local/global optimal solution cannot be improved within M 
iterations (in the work of Hsieh and Tien[15]).  It should be noted that the process of M 
iterations of level 1 adjustment is a testing procedure for including M nearest outside customers 
into M corresponding given clusters.  If current solution cannot be improved within M2 
iterations (specified by Hsieh and Tien[15]), the level 3 adjustment is launched and the solution 
is forced to updated and used as an input for the next iteration. 
In the proposed MSALA algorithm, the merge-split scheme is used to replace the level 3 
adjustment shown in Hsieh and Tien[15] to provide more efficient escapology from local optima.  
In addition, the lunching schedule of merge-split scheme is also modified as a variable, L, instead 
of the fixed M2 to suit different size of supply centers.  The proposed MSALA can be illustrated 
in the following flow chart.

on a Pentium-4 3.1 GHz based PC with 520MB RAM. 
To show the performance of proposed MSALA method, a modified ALA based method 
proposed by Hsieh and Tien[15], denoted as HTALA, is also tested for comparison purpose.  
The HTALA method is one of the most powerful methods existing.  In HTALA, everything 
remains unchanged except self-organizing feature maps method, which is used as an initial 
solution generating function in original work of Hsieh and Tien[15], is replace by K-means 
method.  The data in Table 1 compare the results from the proposed MSALA method and 
HTALA for problems 1-5. 
As shown in Table 3, MSALA outperforms HTALA in almost every aspect.  Within very 
short time limits (10 second), the proposed MSALA method demonstrates an impressive 
capability by achieving 100% of getting known best solution for every problem shown in Table 3.  
Especially, regarding the cases that HTALA fails to achieve 100% of getting know best solution, 
MSALA is much faster than HTALA by referring to the mean run time for getting best solution.
