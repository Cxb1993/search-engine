Abstract 
Design award represents an invaluable asset 
which enables a firm to secure and sustain its 
competitive advantages. Yet design award remains 
locked in a ‘technical’ straitjacket, and the business 
implication of winning a design award is largely 
unexplored. In order to uncover this emergent field, 
the main purpose of this study is to empirically 
examine the effects of the type of design award on 
design capability and business performance. Based on 
the data collected from 64 of Taiwan’s world-class 
design-award-winning projects (i.e., G-mark, iF and 
reddot) during the years 2005 to 2007, four key 
dimensions of design capability (product-reliability, 
technology-application, material-aesthetics, and 
function-usability) and two key dimensions of 
business performance (direct economic benefit and 
indirect economic benefit) are identified. The results 
showed that for the prerequisite of winning a world-
class design award, reddot received significantly 
higher scores on the product-reliability of design 
capability than iF. However, the findings indicated 
that there was no significant relationship between the 
type of design award and business performance. 
Interestingly, the results also revealed that product-
reliability of design capability had positive effects on 
direct economic benefit and indirect economic benefit 
of design performance, while material-aesthetics of 
design capability had a positive effect on indirect 
economic benefit of design performance. It is hoped 
that the outcome of this study could be a useful 
reference for a firm to set its design-investment 
strategies or develop its design capabilities. 
1. Introduction 
In recent years, Taiwan's design capability has 
been recognized world-wide through the fact of 
obtaining many renowned international design awards. 
For instance, in 2007, Taiwanese firms received 38 iF 
design awards, 35 reddot design awards, and 37 G-
Mark design awards. Undoubtedly, Taiwan’s design 
competitiveness has been attributed in part to its great 
achievements in many world-class design 
competitions. However, what design capability of a 
firm can contribute to win a design award? 
Furthermore, could the type of design award have any 
effects on a firm’s business performance? The answers 
to these two fundamental questions are still unknown. 
Rocks (2005, p. 66) noted that Samsung has become 
one of the most valuable brands around the world after 
making a lot of efforts on the investment of design for 
several years to receive a number of world-class 
design awards [14]. This case shows that design 
awards represent a vital factor which enables a firm to 
promote its company reputation and obtain 
competitive advantages promptly. Some researchers 
further posited that design awards are not only 
considered as an effective measurement tool of 
creativity management, but they also have an impact 
on a firm’s business performance [2, 6]. In addition to 
enhancing company reputation and free publicity, 
receiving design awards also stands for obtaining 
social recognition [13]. Therefore, design awards play 
a significant role in a firm’s design competitiveness. 
Yet, design awards remain locked in a technical 
straitjacket, and the business implication of winning a 
design award is largely unexplored. Therefore, the 
main objective of this study is to expand our 
understanding on the potential contributions of design 
awards in a firm by examining the effects of the type 
of design award on design capability and business 
performance. It is important to note that design awards 
in this study refer to product design awards rather than 
other design awards.

4. Data Analyses and Results
4.1 Means and standard deviations of design 
capability and business performance 
Means and standard deviations of the two 
measure dimensions of design capability and business 
performance can be found in Table 5. With regard to 
design capability, the participants expressed higher 
degree of the agreement that “attractive appearance” 
(Mean=6.30) and “semantics delivery” (Mean=6.23) 
are the prerequisites of winning a world-class design 
award. With regard to business performance, 
comparing to a project without a design award, the 
participants expressed higher degree of the agreement 
that a world-class design-award-winning project has 
better performance on “company reputation” 
(Mean=6.08), “free publicity” (Mean=6.14), and 
“innovation ability” (Mean=6.08). Overall, a world-
class design-award-winning project received higher 
scores on indirect economic gains of business 
performance than direct economic gains. According to 
the findings of this study, the participants did not 
agree that a world-class design-award-winning project 
has better “market share” (Mean=3.95 < 4 as the 
median value) of business performance. 
4.2 Reliability and validity analyses 
Table 6 shows the results of factor analysis of the 
eleven design capability variables. Four extracted 
factors, i.e., product-reliability, technology-
application, material-aesthetics, and function-
usability, accounted for 69.478% of the total variance. 
The factorability of the correlation matrix was 
comfortably high, as measured by the Kaiser-Meyer-
Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy (0.707). 
The result of Bartlett's test of sphericity was 
significant at p<0.001. Therefore, factor analysis for 
the variables of construct seemed to be appropriate. 
The Cronbach's α values of four extracted factors 
exceeded the recommended 0.6 criterion suggested by  
6 
 
Guieford and Fruchter [8]. As for design performance, 
Table 7 reports that the results of seven design 
performance variables. Two extracted factors, direct 
economic benefit and indirect economic benefit, 
accounted for 65.419% of the total variance. In the 
construct of design performance, all the values of 
Cronbach's α also exceeded 0.6. In general, high 
values of Cronbach’s α indicate high internal 
consistency of multiple items measuring each 
construct and high reliability of the individual 
construct. As for the content validity, the measurement 
items of the questionnaire test in this study were first 
indentified based on previous related theories, such as 
strategic management and performance theories. Then, 
experienced individual selected from among the 
participants examined these items and confirmed that 
they were useful. As a consequence, the test’s content 
validity was found to be satisfactory. 
 
4.3 The Effects of the type of design award on 
design capability 
Table 8 shows that the variables of design 
capability varied across different design awards. The 
results revealed that reddot received significantly 
higher scores on the product-reliability of design 
capability than iF (F=3.979, p<0.05). However, other 
design capability variables, technology-application, 
material- aesthetics, and function-usability, did not 
vary with the different design awards.  
4.4 The Effects of the type of design award on 
business performance 
Furthermore, the results presented in Table 9 
clearly showed that two design performance variables, 
direct economic benefit and indirect economic benefit, 
were not associated with the type of the design award.

4.5 The Effects of design capability on business 
performance 
In this study, multiple regression analysis was 
performed to test whether design capability would 
have a significant direct effect on business 
performance. First, there is a significant relationship 
between the overall set consisting of design capability 
and the direct economic benefit of design performance 
(F=3.845, p<0.01), as shown in Table 10. In the 
equation of Model 1, the four predictors of design 
capability explained a significant amount of the 
incremental variance (△R² =0.153) for direct 
economic benefit. Among them, product-reliability 
was a positive predicator (t-value =3.776, p <0.001). 
Furthermore, there is also a significant relationship 
between the overall set consisting of design capability 
and the indirect economic benefit of design 
performance (F=3.712, p<0.01). In the equation of 
Model 2, the four predictors of design capability 
8 
 
causation. Secondly, the current findings pertain to 
firms in Taiwan, and results may differ in other 
settings; therefore, there is a need for future work to 
validate the findings in other countries. Despite these 
limitations, preliminary implications are useful for 
managing the relationships between the type of design 
award, design capability, and business performance, 
especially when a firm would like to set its design-
investment strategies or develop its design capabilities.
