Abstract—An effective frequency offset 
acquisition technique based on differential 
detection for wireless orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM) communication is 
investigated in this project report. By taking 
advantage of differentially coherent detection, 
data-aided frequency acquisition assisted by 
frequency domain pseudo-noise (PN) matched 
filters (MF’s) can achieve lower probabilities of 
false alarm and miss over a propagation channel 
with a wide enough coherence bandwidth than 
its noncoherent counterpart can. Furthermore, 
the proposed technique can also function very 
well over a severely frequency-selective fading 
channel while the subcarrier-level differential 
detection is exploited. Extensive computer 
simulations verified the superiority of the 
proposed technique. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In practice, carrier frequency offset caused by 
the Doppler effects and/or by ill-stability and 
mismatch of the local oscillator inevitably 
occurs in any wireless communication system. 
This effect undoubtedly leads to severe perfor-
mance degradation in an OFDM system 
because of inter-subcarrier/subchannel 
interference (ICI). Several frequency offset 
correction techniques for OFDM systems have 
been proposed previously [1]-[8]. Many of 
them only dealt with a frequency offset less 
than the inter-subcarrier frequency separation. 
The techniques described in [1]-[4] are 
modifications or variants of a maximum

A. ML Detection of Testing Two Worst 
-Case Simple Hypotheses 
1) Noncoherent Detection: In accordance 
with the previous derivations, it is obvious that 
the major difficulty of the ordinary likelihood 
functions mainly results from the very 
complicated pdf’s of the derived random 
variables 0 0 ( )A g ε= and 1 1( )A g ε= . Therefore, 
the two derived random variables 0 ( )A ε and 
1( )A ε are first set to be constant by taking the 
only care of the worst cases; and the (fixed) 
noncentrality parameters are, thus, exploited in 
the likelihood functions for the sake of 
simplifying the detection procedure. As a result, 
the decision variable 20S Y=  can be simplified 
to have a noncentral  distribution with two 
degrees of freedom and noncentrality 
parameter

probabilities of a false-alarm occurrence and a 
miss occurrence can be written as

density function (cdf) of a noncentral 
random variable with 2X μ degrees of freedom 
and noncentrality parameter and  is2a nct
 a 
design parameter representing the decision 
threshold of the derived noncoherent detection. 
2) Differentially Coherent Detection: The 
above noncoherent detector can further be 
improved by means of a differentially coherent 
detection technique. Let us consider the random 
variable 0 2 0Z Y= which can be expressed as

where *( )⋅  denotes the complex conjugate 
operation, and {}Re ⋅  represents taking the real 
part. Now, the decision variable can be 
represented as a bD γ γ= − . As a result, the 
probability of false alarm of the differentially 
coherent subcarrier acquisition technique 
proposed here, is given by

A. Rayleigh Flat Fading 
Since the complexity of further derivations 
presents a challenge for theoretical calculation 
of the error probability, we consider a 
simplified condition where a Rayleigh flat 
fading channel and a limited fractional carrier 
frequency offset exist. Under such a condition, 
the output of the matched filter can be rewritten 
as

attributed to the ability of the subcarrierlevel 
differential detection technique to effectively 
deal with the frequency-selective fading effects 
and to the ability of the proposed technique to 
effectively exploit the inherent frequency 
diversity by means of the PN MF. 
 
V. CONCLUSION 
A frequency acquisition technique with 
differentially coherent detection has been 
thoroughly investigated. The proposed 
technique can achieve lower probabilities of 
false alarm and miss on a channel with a 
sufficiently wide coherence bandwidth by 
taking advantage of the frequency-domain 
MF’s. Furthermore, it can also operate very 
well over a severely frequency-selective fading 
channel because the subcarrier-level differential 
detection technique is applied. The superiority 
of the proposed technique has been confirmed 
by extensive computer simulations as well as 
some statistical analysis.

technique is based on a strong assumption that the multipath
delays are slowly time-varying and can easily be estimated
separately from the channel gain estimation.
Meanwhile, several previous works have taken chirp or
linearly frequency modulated (LFM) signals as training se-
quences for time-domain (TD) synchronization [17] in OFDM
systems assisted from Frank codes and other similar sequences
[18]–[20]. Newman phases were also employed in an OFDM
system and proven suboptimal for the purpose of reducing
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) [21], [22]. In addition, a
search strategy of optimum training sequences for general CE
problems has been investigated previously [23].
The CTPA is also employed as the framework of the
technique studied in this paper because of its popularity,
suitability and effectiveness in mobile OFDM communications
on rapidly time-varying, frequency-selective fading channels.
A least-squares estimation (LSE) approach will be performed
serially on a block-by-block basis in the TD in order to not
only accurately estimate CIR, but also effectively track rapid
CIR variations. In fact, a generic estimator is, thus, performed
on each OFDM block without assistance from a priori channel
information (e.g., correlation functions in the frequency and/or
in the time directions) and without increasing computational
complexity. Furthermore, a successful application of chirp or
LFM signals involved in CE for CTPA OFDM communication
systems is ﬁrst addressed in this paper. By taking advantage of
either LFM or sliding partial-period pseudo-random (SPPPR)
pilot symbols that are transceived for the purpose of sounding
pilot subchannels, the proposed LS CE can inherently perform
PN MF to effectively suppress multipath interference (MPI)
caused by frequency-selective fading and ICI resulting from
data subchannels.
Many previous works [11]–[13], [15], [16] based on CTPA
were derived under the assumption of perfect timing syn-
chronization. In practice, some residual timing error within
several sampling durations may inevitably occur with the
DFT demodulation process, and this timing error actually
leads to extra phase rotations corrupting demodulated symbols.
Although a method has been studied for solving this problem
occurring in the conventional CTPA OFDM CEs [10], [14],
the method studied previously can work only under some
special conditions [10]. By taking the previous works [10]–
[16] into comparison, the proposed technique can be shown
to achieve better resistance against residual timing errors
because it does not employ a priori channel information, thus
avoiding model mismatch and extra phase rotation problems
and because it performs ideal data-subchannel interpolation by
means of a domain-transformation approach, thus effectively
tracking extra phase rotations with no phase lag. Eventually,
the superiority of the proposed technique will be proven by
extensive computer simulation and statistical analysis.

where the 0s denote the symbols transmitted via the virtual
subchannels. Therefore, if the orthogonality can be completely
preserved, data symbols can then be appropriately recovered
by means of a DFT operation at the receiving end.
In a CTPA OFDM system, the transmitted symbols on the
subchannels can be expressed in the vector representation for
simplicity as follows:
X = {Xk} ∈ CN×1 (3)
where

case; Dk′ represents the k′th information-bearing data symbol;
Ivsc stands for the index set of the virtual subchannels; and
Ipsc stands for the index set of the pilot subchannels. The block
modulation of OFDM can be reformulated in the following
matrix operation:

SVD [10]–[16]. After the estimation of the pilot-subchannel
gains is accomplished by FDLS, LMMSE or SVD, some
smoothing or interpolation/extrapolation methods should be
performed in order to ﬁlter the estimates of the channel gains
on the data subchannels out from MPI, ICI and noise. The
previously-mentioned pilot-subchannel estimation and data-
subchannel interpolation/extrapolation can often be considered
an upsampling process conducted in the FD, and can thus be
performed fully on the subchannel space in conventional CTPA
OFDM communication.
As a matter of fact, the proposed technique exploits a TDLS
method to estimate leading channel tap-weighting coefﬁcients
in the CIR, then subsequently conducting zero-padding to
form an N -element vector, and ﬁnally conducting the DFT
operation on the resultant vector to effectively perform the
smoothing in the FD. This thus accomplishes ideal interpola-
tion by means of the domain-transformation method as used
previously [24]. Therefore, the whole channel transfer func-
tion, including all of the channel gains on the pilot, data and
virtual subchannels over the entire occupied frequency band
can be obtained simultaneously. Typically, the multipath delay
spread of the transmission channel may be highly dynamic,
and cannot be pre-determined a priori at the receiving end.
Therefore, the number of channel tap-weighting coefﬁcients is
often assumed to be less than L for the purpose of taking the
worst, ISI-free case into consideration. The training sequence
x in the time direction, which is actually IDFT-transformed
from the Nsp in-band pilot symbols, roughly has a period
of NNsp because the pilot subchannels are equally spaced by
Nsp subchannels. Therefore, the proposed technique based on
CTPA can effectively estimate, at most, the leading NNsp chan-
nel tap-weighting coefﬁcients. Meanwhile, in accordance with
Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion theorem [25], the training
sequence x can be considered a random sequence composed
of Np degrees of freedom. Therefore, the order of the TDLS
technique proposed in this paper can be conservatively de-
termined, at most, to be Np. Based on the above reasons,
the number of channel tap-weighting coefﬁcients is assumed
less than or equal to Np; and thus, the longest path delay is
assumed to be less than NpTs. Therefore, the received signals
rd can be reformulated as
rd = cd · g + nd = cd · g + n˜d, (14)
where cd = cd + c˜d; n˜d = c˜d · g +nd, which can be easily
shown to have i.i.d. Gaussian elements;
cd =
{
cdp,q
} ∈ CN×Np , cdp,q = x|p−d−q|N + x˜|p−d−q|N ,
cd =
{
cdp,q
} ∈ CN×Np , cdp,q = x|p−d−q|N ,
c˜d =
{
c˜dp,q
} ∈ CN×Np , c˜dp,q = x˜|p−d−q|N ,
0 ≤ p ≤ N − 1, 0 ≤ q ≤ Np − 1;
cd is an N × Np circulant matrix with its left-most column
being
column0 (cd) =
[
x|−d|N x|1−d|N · · · x|N−1−d|N
]T ;
nd = {nk−d} ∈ CN×1,
k = L,L + 1, · · · , L + N − 1,
is an AWGN vector with N i.i.d. entries; and
g = {gm} ∈ CNp×1,
m = 0, 1, · · · , Np − 1,
contains the effective components representing the channel
tap-weighting coefﬁcients. If no residual timing error exists,
i.e., d = 0, then gm = hm, m = 0, 1, · · · , Lc − 1 and
gm = 0, Lc ≤ m < Np. Here, Lc ≤ Np, and (Np − Lc)
components in g must be left as zeros due to the lack of
precise information on Lc at the receiving end. As a result, the
channel tap-weighting coefﬁcients can be estimated by means
of a standard over-determined LS method based on the pilot
symbols, i.e.,
ĝTDLS = {ĝTDLSm } =
(
cH0 c0
)−1
cH0 · rd ∈ CNp×1,
m = 0, 1, · · · , Np − 1,
(15)
where
c0 =
{
c0p,q
} ∈ CN×Np ,
c0p,q = x|p−q|N ,
0 ≤ p ≤ N − 1, 0 ≤ q ≤ Np − 1.
In accordance with the central limit theorem (CLT), the ICI
terms, x˜n, n = 0, 1, · · · , N − 1, in (5) are i.i.d. zero-mean
Gaussian random variables with the variance N−Np−NvN σ
2
Xk
,
where σ2Xk is the transmitted signal power. In addition, all
the elements obtained in (c˜d · g) are linear combinations of
i.i.d. Gaussian random variables; and all noise elements are
i.i.d. Gaussian random variables. Based on the above practical
assumptions in conjunction with the linear model expressed in
(14), the TDLS estimates of CIR derived in (15) are, in fact,
minimum-variance, unbiased (MVU) estimates; and therefore,
their estimation errors undoubtedly achieve the Cramer-Rao
low bounds (CRLB) [26].
In practice, a residual timing error occurring with the DFT
demodulation process inherently leads to phase errors rotating
the demodulated symbols. The phase errors caused by a timing
error d on each subchannel are linearly dependent on both
of the timing error d and the subchannel index k. Any little
residual timing error can severely degrade the performances
of all the previous works exploiting the two-stage CTPA CEs
[10]–[16]. On the other hand, the proposed technique has some
higher level of tolerance to a timing error. Because the timing
error d occurring with the received training sequence (i.e.,
delayed replica of x) is naturally the same as that occurring
with the received data sequence (i.e., delayed replica of x˜),
the extra phase errors inserted onto the demodulated symbols
on individual subchannels are inherently the same as those
occurring with the estimates of subchannel gains. Therefore,
the extra phase rotations can be completely removed in the
succeeding single-tap equalization process conducted on indi-
vidual subchannels. As a result, the proposed technique can
effectively deal with the problem caused by a residual timing
error.

(TFDI) method [24] on a single-path Rayleigh fading channel
where the maximum mobile speed is 300 km/h. In this ﬁgure,
“TDLS” stands for the technique proposed in this paper;
“SPPPR” stands for the compared techniques with the SPPPR
pilot symbols; “LFM” stands for the compared techniques
with the LFM pilot symbols; and “FDLS”, “LMMSE” and
“SVD”, respectively, represent the conventional CTPA OFDM
with either the FDLS, LMMSE or SVD technique being
used in the pilot-subchannel estimation. The TFDI [24] was
employed for the data-subchannel interpolation in the pre-
vious works compared here for fair comparisons with the
proposed technique, though linear interpolation (LI) or second-
order polynomial interpolation (SOPI) may work effectively
for frequency-nonselective Rayleigh fading. It can be seen
from Fig. 2 that all of the compared techniques suffer from
irreducible error ﬂoors resulting from estimation errors and
ICI because all of them operate in the rapidly time-varying
environment where a wide Doppler spread inevitably leads
to inconstant frequency offset (roughly, up to 2.5% of the
subcarrier spacing in the studied case) and thus, results in
non-negligible ICI; that the simulation results obtained using
perfect CE are close to those obtained using the theoretical
analysis derived in (18); and that the proposed technique
can achieve lower error probabilities than the previous works
compared here [10]–[15] exploiting either FDLS, LMMSE or
SVD followed by the TFDI [24] can. In addition, it can be
seen from Fig. 2 that the performances of FDLS, LMMSE and
SVD in terms of bit-error probabilities are not signiﬁcantly
changed with the two kinds of pilot symbols, either LFM
or SPPPR, being employed here; that the FDLS technique
followed by the TFDI [24] has higher bit-error probabilities
than the previous works based on LMMSE or SVD [10]–
[15] followed by TFDI [24] have; and that the SVD/TFDI
has the same bit-error probabilities as those of LMMSE/TFDI.
It deﬁnitely makes sense that SVD/TFDI and LMMSE/TFDI
should have very close bit-error probability because SVD is
often applied for achieving LMMSE with rank reduction. The
main reason why FDLS/TFDI has higher bit-error probabilities
than SVD/TFDI and LMMSE/TFDI has been explained in
the previous works [10]–[15]. Meanwhile, the previous works
[10]–[15] seem likely to show the superiority of SVD and
LMMSE over FDLS.
Shown in Fig. 3 are the bit-error probabilities obtained using
the TDLS with either LFM or SPPPR pilot symbols, and
the previous works [10]–[15] consisting of pilot-subchannel
estimation based on either FDLS or SVD technique followed
by either the LI or TFDI [24] method on a time-varying
multipath channel which was modeled as a tapped-delay line
with 10 active tap-weighting coefﬁcients with rural-area (RA)
power delay proﬁle drawn from Table II. The channel tap-
weighting coefﬁcients were simulated by independent Jakes’
Rayleigh faders while the highest relative velocity is 300 km/h.
Since the LMMSE technique achieves the same performance
as that of the SVD technique, the simulation results obtained
using LMMSE were not shown in this ﬁgure. It is obviously
shown in Fig. 3 that the simulation results obtained using the
