效能、減少工作電壓及功率、增加記憶容量等。一般快閃記憶體的穿隧介電層(tunnel 
dielectric) 通常都是使用二氧化矽(SiO2)；但由於元件微小化，閘極氧化層的厚度隨著技術
的演進愈來愈薄，當厚度降到 60Å，其漏電流會因直接穿透(direct tunneling)而大幅提升，
使可靠度降低；甚至，在氧化層厚度降到 80Å 時，隨著寫入/擦拭過程中產生的 SILC (Stress 
Induced Leakage Current)影響下，其氧化層的漏電流就已大到使可靠度降低而無法使用
[1]。為了使穿隧氧化層的厚度可以繼續縮小，Jong Jin Lee[2]等人提出使用高介電係數材料
(High Dielectric Constant Material, High-k  Material)來取代傳統的穿隧閘極介電層。根據研
究發現，由於高介電係數材料的介電常數遠大於二氧化矽，因此在相同的等效厚度之下
(Equivalent Oxide Thickness, EOT)，其漏電流明顯低於 SiO2，故可利用較厚的 High-k 取代
傳統的 SiO2 薄膜，來達成元件所需要的電性條件。此外由於 High-k 材料的能障高度較低，
所以當快閃記憶體在執行寫入/擦拭操作時，其寫入/擦拭速度可以提高許多。 
高介電係數的材料已有不少學者在嚐試，如Ta2O5，Al2O3，ZrO2[3]，HfO2[4]等，雖
然有不錯的效果，但是由於材料含氧及金屬，經後續製程之熱循環(Thermal cycle)，製成元
件後仍保有優越電特性就很不容易。在許多高介電係數材料中HfOxNy、HfSiON、及HfO2
等HfO-based metal oxide，因為具high dielectric constant, good thermal stability, wide bandgaps, 
large band offsets等優點[4]，非常受到重視。近來將氮元素置入金屬氧化物形成HfON合金，
結果閘介電層具有higher breakdown field, crystalline retardation, reduced leakage current等優
點。因此，本研究計畫係以含氮氣體進行矽表面之氮化，然後再成長高介電係數之金屬氧
化物使其EOT在15 A 以下。再由適當之high-K成份元素比例及成長後之退火處理，預期可
以得到特性相當不錯的介電層。因此，應用我們已能掌握5 A 以下的SiOxNy，再成長high-K 
metal-oxide，是本研究已有的經驗基礎。本計已完成HfOxNy，結果顯示MOS元件特性已不
錯，可以再進行製程參數試驗以進一步改善，我們探討Hf、O、N各種元素間混合比例效
應。 
為了滿足元件微小化同時有快速的寫入特性，必需設法消除元件寫入時遇到額外的穿
隧能障，高介電材料有較小的能隙及較高的 Bulk trap density 等作為電荷儲存層的特點，故
高介電材料被視為電荷儲存層的熱門材料之一。但高介電材料普遍的問題:熱穩定性不佳，
無法忍受 CMOS 製程的熱預算。已有文獻報告[5,6]，當 HfO2 添加 Al2O3 後會使得薄膜的
熱穩定性獲得改善且能保有不錯的能隙及高的電荷缺陷密度，這使得高介電材料被實際應
用在 charge-trapping type flash 記憶體上的可能性大為提昇。 
本研究藉由 low-K/high-K 堆疊結構當穿隧氧化層，及以多層不同 Hf/Al 比例電荷儲存
層堆疊，以探討對 flash 記憶體操作特性的影響，並探討最佳製程條件及製程整合結果。本
研究藉由 ALD 系統沉積不同 Hf/Al 組成比的 HfxAlyO 來作為電荷儲存層，以尋找具熱穩

以 low-K/high-K 堆疊結構當穿隧氧化層對 MOS 無隔離結構記憶體操作特性的影響除
了由 High-K 材料取代 Si3N4 可提供較小的能隙差(band offset)來改善寫入/抹除特性外，本
研究探討另一種可提高穿隧電流的方法，即穿隧層由 low-K/high-K 方式堆疊而成，因 K 值
的不同可使得加在穿隧氧化層上的偏壓大部分落在 K 值較低的材料上，較大的電場將三角

Then, Al2O3 films (∼15 nm) as the blocking oxides were also
deposited by the ALD system, followed by the deposition of
a 200-nm TaN metal gate using a sputter system. After gate
patterning, source and drain were formed by implantation with
arsenic atoms, which are activated at 900 ◦C for 30 s. Finally,
a sintering was conducted in a N2/H2 ambient at 420 ◦C for
30 min. The gate-width-to-gate-length ratio of devices, i.e.,
W/L, measured in this letter is 20/1 µm.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For NAND Flash applications, the cell devices are operated
under channel Fowler–Nordheim (FN) programming/
erasing. The programming characteristics at VProgram(VP ) =
VGate(VG)− VThreshold(VTh) = 8 V for Flash devices with
HfAlO trapping layers formed by various HfO2/Al2O3 (Hf/Al)
ratios are illustrated in Fig. 1(a). The memory window appears
after a programming time of ∼0.1 ms for all samples. For
a distinct comparison, the programming time at a memory
window of 1 V for all samples is shown in Fig. 1(b). Relatively
speaking, high-speed programming performance can be
achieved in S4 (Hf/Al = 1/1) and S5 (Hf/Al = 1/2) devices.
By adding Al atoms into HfO2, the conduction band offset
of the resulting HfAlO with respect to Si is approximately
equal to that of pure HfO2 and comparable programming
characteristic is consequently achieved [6]. Moreover, the band
gap of HfAlO can be adjusted by tuning the content percentage
of Al or Hf [8]. In addition, the trap density of the HfAlO
trapping layer can be increased by increasing the doping of
Al atoms into HfO2, which further results in a larger memory
window [6]. In short, the improvements on the programming
performance made in this letter may be attributed to the proper
band offset and the high trap density generated by doping
suitable Al content into the HfAlO charge-trapping layer.
Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the erasing characteristics with
VErase(VE) = VGate(VG)− VThreshold(VTh) = −12 V and the
erasing time at a memory window of 1 V for Flash devices
with various HfAlO trapping layers, respectively. Comparable
268 IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS, VOL. 29, NO. 3, MARCH 2008
are Vg/Vd = 12/7 V and Vs = Vsub = 0 V. The programming
times at a memory window of 1 V for both devices are
∼2.4 µs. The erasing characteristics of S4 and S5 samples are
shown in Fig. 4(b). An obviously high erasing speed (∼30 µs)
can be obtained by the method of BTB hot hole erasing as
compared to the channel FN erasing. Therefore, high-speed
operation of Flash device can be achieved by suitably tuning
the compositions in the HfAlO trapping layer.
IV. CONCLUSION
Electrical characteristics of the SONOS-type nonvolatile
memory device with HfAlO charge-trapping layer have been
studied in this letter. Results indicate that the operation perfor-
mance can be improved by suitably tuning the Al contents in
the HfAlO charge-trapping layer. The physical mechanism for
the improvement can be explained by the modification in band
offset, crystallization temperature of the materials, and/or trap
density of the charge-trapping layer.

However, the application of stacked tunneling oxide and charge
trapping layer on SONOS device is rarely reported.
In this work, the effects of stacked tunneling oxide on operating
characteristics of SONOS devices were investigated. Then, the elec-
trical characteristics of SONOS memory devices with stacked
charge trapping layers were also studied. Finally, the combination
of both stacked tunneling oxide and charge trapping layer on de-
vice operation were demonstrated and compared.
2. Experiment
MOS capacitors with SONOS structures were fabricated on 6-
inch (100) oriented p-type Czochralski silicon wafers, with resis-
tivity of 15–25X-cm and bow/warp 640 mm. The cross-section
of device structure is shown in Fig. 1. Prior to the deposition of tun-
neling oxide, all wafers were cleaned through a wet cleaning pro-
cess (APM/HPM/DHF). Wet cleaning processes using a NH4OH,
H2O2, and H2O mixture (APM) in the ratio of 1:4:20 (volume) at
75 C and a HCl, H2O2, and H2O mixture (HPM) in the ratio of
1:1:6 (volume) at 75 C were used to remove residue and contam-
ination. The dipping time for all processes was 10 min. Diluted HF
(DHF) with HF and H2O in the ratio of 1:100 (volume) was used to
remove the native oxide. After the wet processes, all wafers were
rinsed with D. I. water for 10 min. Next, the SiO2 ﬁlms with thick-
nesses of 3 nm (S1, S3 and S5) and 4 nm (S2 and S4) were formed
by a clustered vertical furnace, respectively. Then, Al2O3 ﬁlms with
2 nm were deposited by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) system
with Al(CH3)3 precursors and HfO2 ﬁlms with 2 nm were also
deposited by an ALD system using HfCl4 precursors. All high-k
ﬁlms were deposited at 300 C. Next, 7 nm of Si3N4 ﬁlms were
deposited as the charge trapping layers for all samples by a low-
pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Then a top SiO2
(7 nm) blocking layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chem-
ical vapor deposition (PECVD). The detailed process conditions of
various stacked tunneling oxides and trapping layers are summa-
rized in Table 1. Subsequently, a 50 nm TaN ﬁlm was deposited
by a sputtering to serve as metal gate. Then high temperature
annealing was performed to all samples in a N2 ambient for 30 s
at 950 C by a metal rapid thermal anneal (RTA), which were in-
tended to simulate the inﬂuences of source/drain activating in gen-
eral NVM cell processes. Afterwards, an Al ﬁlm with 300 nm was
deposited by sputtering and Al/TaN (300 nm/50 nm) stack ﬁlm
was patterned by helicon wave plasma (HWP) etching. The back-
sides of all samples were deposited with a 500 nm thick Al ﬁlm
by thermal evaporation after the back surface oxide stripping. Fi-
nally, a sintering was conducted in a N2/H2 ambient at 420 C for
30 min. The values of EOT for all samples are about 15 nm. Be-
sides, the VFB for all samples are about 0.5 to 1 V.
3. Results and discussion
The programming characteristics at VProgram (VP) = VGate (VG)–
VFlatband (VFB) = 12 V for SONOS-type nonvolatile semiconductor
memory (NVM) devices with various tunneling oxide structures
(S1–S3) are illustrated in Fig. 2a. The programming speed of S1
sample is enhanced one order of magnitude as compared with that
of S2 one. This indicates that programming operation of NVM de-
vice is obviously inﬂuenced by varying the thickness of tunneling
oxide. With a thinner thickness of tunneling oxide, a faster pro-
gramming speed can be obtained. However, the issue on retention
property of NVM device with the thinner tunneling oxide should
be seriously considered. Next, programming time for S3 (STK_ALO)
device is the smallest. This indicates that programming speed can
be obviously enhanced by adopting multilayer tunneling oxide.
The enhancement on programming operation can be explained
by examining the band diagram of the energy band diagram [9]
illustrated in Fig. 2b. Under the applied bias, the stacked tunneling
oxide acts as a capacitive voltage divider, which redistributes the
bias over these two layers of the stack such that the electric ﬁeld
in each layer is inversely proportional to its dielectric constant.
Since the Al2O3 layer has a lower barrier height, the barrier of
the multilayer tunneling oxide is more transparent for injected
electrons than that of SiO2 layer with identical effective thickness
(EOT) during the programming operation. Therefore, programming
speed can be obviously enhanced by adopting multilayer tunneling
oxide [10].
Fig. 3a shows the erasing characteristics at VErase (VE) = VGate
(VG)–VFlatband (VFB) = 12 V for SONOS-type NVM devices with var-
ious tunneling oxide structures (S1–S3). The erasing speed of S2
sample is the slowest. Erasing speeds for S1 and S3 samples are fas-
ter and approximately equal. Based on the comparison between S1
and S2 samples, sample with a thinner thickness of tunneling oxide
possesses a faster erasing speed. Besides, since S3 sample has
thicker EOT and its valance band offset with respect to Si for
Al2O3 is also larger than as for Si3N4, its hole injecting into Si3N4
trapping layer is less during erasing operation. On the other hand,
a small conduction band offset with respect to Si can be obtained
for sample with stacked tunneling oxide as shown in Fig. 3b. This
situation may make the charged electrons in trapping layer easier
to detrap into Si substrate during erasing. Therefore, the erasing
speeds for S1 and S3 samples are similar even though S3 sample
has an additional Al2O3 layer in tunneling oxide.
The remained memory windows after data retention tests for
NVM devices with various tunneling oxide structures (S1–S3) are
illustrated in Fig. 4. Memory window loss after ten years for S3
sample is about 20% but that for S1 one is 35%. The results
can be attributed to the different physical thicknesses of various
structures in tunneling oxides. In the retention test mode, there
are two possible charge-loss mechanisms. The ﬁrst one is the direct
back tunneling with a barrier height determined by both the con-
duction band offset from the charge trapping layer to tunneling
oxide and the trap energy level in trapping layer. The second one
is the thermally assisted electron detrapping and subsequent tun-
neling back to the substrate. Overall, the detrapping charges from
trapping layer all need to tunnel through the barrier layer formed
by tunneling layer. Therefore, the suppression of detrapping elec-
trons can be obtained by a stacked tunneling oxide with thicker
physical thickness. Thus enhancement on the retention perfor-
mance is achieved by using multilayer tunneling oxide as observed
in Fig. 4. Besides, the samples were set to the programmed states at
ﬁrst for the data retention tests and then some injected electrons
may be located at the interface traps between SiO2 and Al2O3 ﬁlm
for sample S3. Therefore, the initial window loss for sample S3 may
be attributed to these electrons released from the interface traps
during data retention tests at the beginning.Fig. 1. Schematic cross-section of the SONOS devices in this work.

Charge-trapping type flash memory devices with various integrations of metal gates having different
work functions and blocking oxides were investigated in this work. Improved erasing speed together
with acceptable reliability characteristics can be achieved by the integration of high work-function
metal gate and high-k blocking oxide due to an efficient suppression of electron back tunneling
through the blocking oxide during erasing operation for the MoN sample. Specifically, the high
work-function value of MoN metal gate can be kept only by integrating with the Al2O3 blocking
oxide because it can suppress the formation of molybdenum-silicide. Moreover, high-speed erasing
can also be demonstrated by combining the MoN metal gate with an HfAlO charge trapping layer
when band-to-band hot hole erasing method is adopted. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

Polysilicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon SONOS non-
volatile memory NVM device is one of the most attractive
candidates in realizing the continuity of vertical scaling on
flash memory.1–3 However, the phenomenon of electron back
tunneling EBT is known as a serious concern due to the
limitation caused by the low erase states threshold voltage
Vth during higher erasing voltage.4,5 Besides, characteristics
such as erasing speed and the phenomenon of overerase are
still main bottlenecks for SONOS devices to replace the
floating-gate ones. In order to overcome these limitations,
some approaches about adopting high work-function WF
metal gate and high-k charge trapping layer for the NVM
device have been proposed.6,7 However, the integration of
high-WF metal gate, high-k blocking oxide, and high-k trap-

various metal gates and different blocking oxides on the
erasing characteristics for traditional SONOS devices are in-
vestigated first. Afterward, the integration of MoN metal
gate, HfAlO charge trapping layer, and Al2O3 blocking oxide
was further studied in detail based on the above result.8

structures were respectively fabricated. A tunneling SiO2 was
formed by an advanced clustered vertical furnace on the
cleaned p-type wafers; its thickness is 4.0–5.0 nm for ca-
pacitor devices and 3.0 nm for flash cell devices.
For capacitor devices, the 6 nm Si3N4 trapping layer
was deposited after the formation of tunneling oxide. Next, a
blocking oxide with 7.5–8 nm SiO2 samples S1 and S29
and with 15 nm Al2O3 S39 was formed by low-pressure
chemical vapor deposition CVD and metal-organic CVD
systems, individually. Afterward, TaN S19 and MoN S2
and S39 metal gates on ONO stack were deposited by a
sputter system. Finally, high temperature annealing was per-
formed to all samples, which were intended to simulate the
influences of source/drain activation in general NVM cell
processes.
For AHO flash cell devices, 6 nm HfAlO films as
charge-trapping layer and 15 nm Al2O3 films as blocking
oxide were subsequently deposited by atomic layer deposi-
tion system after the formation of tunneling oxide, followed
by a deposition of TaN S49 or MoN S59 metal gate using
a sputter system. After gate patterning, source/drain regions
were formed by implantation with arsenic, activated at
900 °C for 30 s. Finally, sintering was conducted in a N2 /H2
ambient at 420 °C for 30 min.
The erasing characteristics for SONOS devices with
various blocking oxides and metal gates are illustrated in
Fig. 1a. The erasing speed of S2 MoN sample is obvi-
ously enhanced as compared with that of S1 TaN one. This
illustrates that the erasing properties can be improved by
adopting high-WF metal gate. Figure 1b shows a schematic
energy band diagram of SONOS devices with the two differ-
ent metal gates during erasing operations. For a TaN gate
with WF value of 4.5 eV, a relatively low electron barrier
height is observed; it results in an additional electron current
Je,TaN injecting from the metal gate. Therefore, the sum of
Je and hole current Jh causes a small erasing window and a
low erasing speed. However, with an increased WF value
5.15 eV by adopting MoN gate, erasing characteristics
are obviously improved due to the rise in electron barrier
height and the suppression of the additional electron current
Je,MoN injecting under erasing mode.
Next, the erasing performances of devices with MoN
gate combined with different blocking oxides were investi-
gated. The erasing speed for a device with Al2O3 blocking

oxide S39 is clearly higher than that with the traditional
SiO2 S2.9 The enhancement in erasing properties can be
explained by examining the band diagram illustrated in Fig.
2a. The additional electron current Je,Al2O3 during opera-
tion is suppressed by the Al2O3 blocking oxide, which pos-
sesses larger physical thickness as compared with the SiO2
one having identical effective thickness.8
The influence caused by the formation of molybdenum-
silicide is another issue that needs to be studied. Figure 2b
displays the x-ray diffraction XRD spectra for samples with
MoN deposited on SiO2 oxide under different annealing tem-
peratures. The crystalline peak of Mo5Si3 is clearly observed
after high temperature annealing, which indicates the forma-
tion of molybdenum silicide. The presence of molybdenum
silicide in MoN film may lower down the WF value.10 There-
fore, the integration of MoN gate with Al2O3 blocking oxide
can suppress the formation of metal silicide, thus enhance
the erasing characteristics of the flash device.
To further improve the operating speed, the metal gates
of TaN S49 and MoN S59 were adopted for NVM devices
with MAHOS structures.7 Once more, the enhancement in
erasing speed by the Fowler–Nordheim FN operation for
NVM device with MoN metal gate is achieved as shown in
Fig. 3a, which can also be attributed to the suppression of
EBT through the blocking oxide during erasing operation. In
addition, adopting MoN gate leads to a higher magnitude in
hole current, which exceeds the electron current under eras-
ing mode. As a result, the erasing Vth can be lower than that
of the TaN one.
Regarding NOR device applications, erasing with band-
to-band BTB hot hole was adopted and the relative erasing
characteristics are also shown in Fig. 3a. Results indicate
that the improvement in erasing speed is obvious for the
MoN sample. Since adopting BTB hot hole erasing leads to a
higher electric field across the gate and the drain sides, the
additional electron tunneling current from metal gate can be
suppressed more efficiently with the MoN gate. Besides, due
to the higher WF value of MoN gate, its substrate and tun-
neling oxide bands bend downward much larger than those
of the TaN one at thermal equilibrium. Therefore, when the
fixed erasing voltage of BTB-FN operation is applied, a
more band bending for the substrate of MoN device can be
expected Fig. 3b, which leads to more hot-hole accumu-
lation during BTB-FN operation and then causes more hot
holes to be injected into the trapping layer.
Finally, some reliability characteristics for MAHOS flash
devices with different metal gates were investigated. The
program/erase P/E endurance characteristics of the S4 and
S59 samples are plotted in Fig. 4a. The results show that
both memory windows remain large enough 2.2 and 2.5
V and only a negligible Vt-shift is seen. The remained
threshold voltage Vth windows after data retention test for
MAHOS flash devices with different metal gates are illus-
trated in Fig. 4b. Anticipated memory window loss after 10
years is about 17.3% for the S49 sample and 23.5% for
the S5,9 indicating that the retention performance for all
samples is acceptable.
Electrical characteristics of charge-trapping type flash
memory devices with various metal gates and blocking ox-
ides are studied in this work. Results indicate that the erasing
performance of flash devices can be improved by adopting
high-WF metal gate. Notably, the MoN metal gate should be
integrated with high-k blocking oxide to keep its high work
function. Besides, by integrating the MoN gate, Al2O3 block-
ing oxide, and HfAlO charge trapping layer of MAHOS flash
devices and adopting BTB hot hole erasing method, high
erasing speed and satisfactory reliability characteristics are
also demonstrated.

thermal anneal, which was intended to simulate the influence
of source/drain activating in general NVM cell processes. Af-
terward, an Al film with 300 nm was deposited by sputtering,
and Al/TaN (300 nm/50 nm) stack film was patterned by helicon
wave plasma etching. Finally, a sintering was conducted in a
N2/H2 ambient at 420 ◦C for 30 min. The band offset, bandgap,
and dielectric constant can be estimated by referring to the
study in [7].
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The operation characteristics at VProgram(VP )[=
VGate(VG)− VFlatband(VFB)] = 10 V and VErase(VE)[=
(VGate(VG)− VFlatband(VFB)] = −10 V for Flash devices
with various single and stacked trapping layers are shown
in Fig. 1(a). Comparing the two samples with single high-k
trapping layer, the operating speed of S1 (HfO2) sample is
slightly higher than that of S2 (HfAlO14) sample; the reason
can be attributed to the different band offsets for those two
films [3]. However, the S1 (HfO2) Flash device has a serious
problem in retention characteristics. On the other hand, the
Flash device with HfAlO layer containing higher Al ratio
(S2) possesses better thermal stability and good retention
properties but shows lower operating speed for memory
application [4]. Thus, by combining the advantages of S1 and
S2 samples, various stacked structures based on those two films
(HfO2/HfAlO14) were adopted in this letter to form better
trapping layers. Experimental results show that high-speed P/E
performance can be achieved by stacked trapping layer (i.e., S3
∼ S4), particularly the Stk_14Hf (S4) device. This illustrates
that the operating characteristics can be improved by adopting
suitable stacked HfO2/HfAlO14 structure for trapping layers
despite their individual disadvantages.
The remaining memory windows after data retention tests for
various Flash devices are shown in Fig. 1(b), and the VFB values
@ t = 0 s for all samples in the initial stage of data retention test
are ∼3–4 V. The retention properties for devices with HfAlO
trapping layer, single or stacked, are enhanced as compared to
that with single HfO2 (i.e., S1). The reasons can be attributed
to the additional energy barrier for stacked trapping layer and
the reduction of crystallization for HfAlO, which suppresses
electrons in the trapping layer from leaking out to Si substrate.
Fig. 2. (a) Ideal schematic energy band diagram of charge-trapping-type
devices for sample S1 (solid line) and sample S4 (dotted line) with single and
stacked structures on trapping layer. (b) Ideal schematic energy band diagram of
charge-trapping-type devices for sample S2 (solid line), sample S5 (dash line),
and sample S4 (dotted line) with various stacked structures on trapping layer.
The band diagrams of Flash devices with single trapping
layer (S1) and the stacked one (S4) are shown in Fig. 2(a). As
compared to the HfO2 film, a better thermal stability with less
charge loss paths [8], a higher trap density [4], and a broader
range of energy level for traps and larger trap cross section [9]
can be possessed by doping Al atoms into HfO2 film. Although
the injected current for S4 sample during the programming op-
eration may be slightly reduced due to a larger conduction band
offset of the HfAlO14 film, substrate-injected electrons are
more efficiently caught by some of shallow-energy-level traps
for the HfAlO14 layer compared to the HfO2 one. Moreover,
with a lower initial substrate-injected current and fewer residual
injected electrons after tunneling through the HfAlO14 film for
S4 sample, charges accumulated at the second-layer/blocking
oxide interface are decreased, which leads to a lower leakage
current near the blocking oxide [6]. Furthermore, as compared
to the single HfAlO (S2) one, a higher injected current for
the HfAlO14/HfO2 stack (S4) is obtained due to the lower
bandgap of second film in the trapping layer [4]. Thus, the
enhancement on programming property can be obtained by the
stacked structure of S4 device.
For the erasing operation, the partial trapped electrons in
shallow energy level of HfAlO14 film are easy to detrap as
compared to those in the HfO2 one according to the energy band
diagram shown in Fig. 2(a). Moreover, the substrate-injected
