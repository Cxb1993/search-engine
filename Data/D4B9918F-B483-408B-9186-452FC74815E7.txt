Therefore, methods are required to enhance the wear-resistance of the CaF2 -like 
deposits in order to improve the long-term effectiveness of the treatment process. 
    Laser was first applied in dentistry in 1964 by Stern and Sognnaes, who showed 
that irradiation by a ruby laser results in a significant improvement in the resistance of 
enamel to acid. Since that time, many other forms of laser irradiation have been 
shown not only to improve the acid resistance of enamel, but also to increase fluoride 
uptake on the enamel surface [10-14]. Of the various forms of laser system available, 
the pulsed CO2 laser is the most appropriate for dental healthcare applications [15]. 
The wavelengths of visible and near-infrared laser systems (e.g. Ar and Nd-YAG 
lasers) are only weakly absorbed by enamel [16]. As a result, very high irradiation 
intensity is required to achieve the desired effect, and thus the risk of damaging the 
underlying pulp increases. By contrast, CO2 lasers have an infrared wavelength, 
which is readily absorbed by the enamel surface. Consequently, the scattered energy is 
very low and the laser irradiation energy is confined to the enamel surface. 
Furthermore, the use of a pulsed irradiation technique minimizes the accumulated 
energy within the enamel surface, and therefore further reduces the risk of thermal 
pulp damage. Although laser irradiation improves the acid resistance of enamel, it can 
also result in certain undesirable effects such as carbonization, or the formation of 
craters, cracks and pores. Accordingly, various researchers have suggested that in 
preventing dental caries, the ideal approach is to apply a topical fluoride treatment to 
the enamel surface initially and then using an appropriate laser irradiation process for 
the surface thermal treatment [10, 17-19].  
    The mechanical properties of engineering materials are commonly evaluated by 
indentation tests. However, the large indentation size and depth in conventional 
microhardness systems limits the precision detection at smaller scales such as enamel 
rods and the thin film coating of the CaF2-like deposits [20-21].  
  5
[29-31] were limited at the global measurement level that applied a normal force of 
1–40 N and a wear stroke at 500 μm–3 mm, which would cover at least 100 enamel 
rods. Thus, precision measurement at single rod or sub-rod scale is impossible using 
these approaches. As a result, nanoscale tribological studies have been conducted 
recently. Guidoni et al. (2008) [32] studied the nanoscale tribological behavior of the 
enamel under different loads. The wear mechanism was comparable with glass at low 
loads (50 μN) and with metal crystals at high load (100 μN). Moreover, nanoscratch 
tests have been widely applied to characterize thin film coatings with a thickness of 
no more than a few nanometers [33].  
This study of human enamel structure utilizes nanoindentation and nanoscratch 
tests to characterize the nanomechanical and nanotribological properties of individual 
enamel rods in various positions along the vertical and longitudinal planes. Moreover, 
the investigation of topical fluoride treatment conducts a systematic investigation into 
the morphology, nanohardness, elastic modulus, nanowear resistance and fluoride 
uptake of native enamel surfaces and fluoride-treated enamel surfaces following CO2 
laser irradiation at various times, respectively.

2.2 Sample preparation 
2.2.1 Collection of human tooth 
The samples were collected with the patients’ informed consent (as approved by 
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan). 
The extracted teeth were sterilized by ultraviolet rays irradiating and stored in a saline 
solution at 4°C until prepared.   
 
2.2.2 Enamel preparation  
The crowns were sectioned longitudinally along the mid labial surface after 
removal of the root. Half of the specimens were embedded in resin (Lang Dental, Erie, 
PA, USA), ground and then polished to reveal a coronal cross-section enamel surface 
of about 3 x 3 mm, while the remainder were ground and polished to expose an 
axial-section enamel surface. In both cases, the enamel surfaces were polished 
initially in a cooling and debris-purging water spay using an Ecomet 3 grinder / 
polisher (Buehler Ltd., Lake Bluff, IL, USA) with 240~4000-grit silicon carbide discs 
rotating at a speed of 50 rpm. The samples were then polished for 3 min using a 0.05 
μm alumina oxide suspension contained on a felt cloth rotating at a speed of 250 rpm. 
Finally, the samples were polished for 30 min in a cooling water spray using a felt 
cloth rotating at a speed of 250 rpm. The polished samples were then cleaned 
ultrasonically in ddH2O for 3 min.  
 
2.2.3 Topical fluoride treatment 
   The specimens were air dried and treated for 4 min with a 2 % NaF gel attached to 
a Mylar strip carefully positioned to ensure only half of the specimen was treated (Fig. 
2-1(d)). The specimen was then rinsed in ddH2O with the non-treated surface region 
held upward to prevent from contamination by the fluoride in the treated region.

2.3.2 Nanoindentation measurement 
    The Hysitron TriboScope is an attached DSI system to a scanning probe 
microscope (SPM), consisting of a force-displacement transducer, a transducer 
controller, and a computer (see Fig. 2-2). The combination of a DSI system with a 
SPM has a symbiotic effect: it extends the SPM in the capability of making DSI 
experiments with a high load and depth resolution (100 nN and 0.2 nm, respectively), 
and it enables the DSI system to take scanning force images of the sample surface by 
using the same diamond tip for imaging and for indentation. The heart of the 
TriboScope is a three plate capacitive force-displacement transducer (Fig. 2-3). It 
consists of two fixed drive plates and a pick-up electrode, which is spring mounted to 
the housing. The diamond tip is mounted to the pick-up electrode, which can move up 
and down. To perform an indentation, an electrostatic force is generated between the 
pick-up electrode and a drive plate. The amount of this force, F, is proportional to the 
square of the voltage applied to the drive plate as follows:

    A Berkovich tip with a radius of curvature of about 100 nm was as indenter. In 
the nanoindentation tests, the force (F) and displacement (d) data were acquired 
continuously over the course of the loading-unloading indentation cycles, and were 
then used to calculate the nanohardness and reduced elastic modulus of the treated and 
non-treated enamel surfaces in accordance with the Oliver and Pharr equation (Oliver 
and Pharr, 1992) [34].

area were scanned. 
2.3.5 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Probe 
     Micro Analysis (EPMA)  
    Prior to the SEM and EPMA observations, the specimens were dehydrated in a 
vacuum chamber for 100 h and then coated with a uniform layer of carbon with a 
thickness of around 20 nm to prevent electrostatic charging. The SEM and EPMA 
observations were performed using a JXA-8500F microanalyzer (Jeol Inc., Japan) 
with an accelerating voltage of 12 kV and a probe current of 15 nA). In the analysis of 
EPMA, they randomly selected regions in each corresponding enamel surface were 
detected.  
     
2.3.6 Statistical analysis 
   The differences observed in the nanomechanical and nanotribological properties 
of the various regions of the enamel rods were evaluated using the Bonferroni’s test 
for multiple comparisons. The significance level was designated as with a significance 
level of p<0.05. The SPSS 12.0 statistical software was used to statistical analysis in 
this study.

analysis, as shown Fig. 3-1(d). 
In summary, it revealed that mechanical property of enamel is a function of 
position relative to tooth surface at micro scale, and an anisotropic material within 
each individual rod at nano scale. 
 
3.1.3 Nanotribological properties 
Fig. 3-2(a)~(d) indicates the positions and directions of the various scratch tests 
performed in this study. Figure 3-2(e) shows the mean friction coefficients of the head, 
tail, and axial-section regions (scratch mark parallel to the long-axis of the rod) of the 
enamel rod at load 500 μN. The obtained values were 0.087±0.002, 0.094±0.001 and 
0.108±0.006, respectively. The friction coefficient of the head was significantly lower 
than that of the tail and the axial-section plan (p<0.05). Figure 3-2(f) illustrates the 
gradual increase in the friction coefficient of both scratch directions from enamel 
surface toward DEJ. The friction coefficient in the direction parallel to the rod axis 
increases from 0.108±0.006 to 0.123±0.006 (enamel surface to the DEJ), while they 
were 0.111±0.002 to 0.134±0.003 in the perpendicular direction. The Student’s t-test 
revealed that the friction coefficients in the direction parallel to the longitudinal-axis 
of the rods are significantly lower than performed in the perpendicular direction.  
The mean scratch residual depths in the head, tail and axial-section regions 
(scratch in the direction parallel to the longitudinal-axis of the enamel rod) of the rod 
were 6.65±0.62 nm, 7.63±0.42 nm and 7.16±0.64 nm, respectively (Fig. 3-3(a)). The 
mean scratch depth of the head region of the rod is significantly lower than that of the 
tail region and the axial-section plan (p<0.05). No significant difference exists 
between the tail and axial-section plan. Figure 3-2(b) shows the scratch residual depth 
increases with increase in the distance from the outer enamel in both scratch 
directions. The mean scratch depth in the direction parallel to the long-axis of the rods 
  15
107.83 nm. Hence, the mean height of the fluoride-treated enamel surface relative to 
the non-treated surface was 523.90 ± 43.00 nm. The mean diameter of the aggregates 
protruding from the surface of the deposited layer was found to be 1.14 ± 0.84 μm. 
The surface roughness was characterized by root-mean-square of the roughness height 
(Rq), the average roughness height (Ra), and the maximum peak-to-valley height 
(Rmax). The surface roughness after fluoride treatment (Rq=69.30 ± 5.22nm, Ra=51.28 
± 3.92 nm, Rmax=523.90 ± 43.00 nm) was significantly higher (p<0.001  ) than that 
of the adjacent control surface (Rq=3.27 ± 0.20 nm, Ra=2.49 ± 0.15 nm, Rmax=35.59 ± 
3.63 nm). However, following removal of the loosely bound deposits, the surface 
roughness was restored to a value close to that of the original native surface (Rq=3.94 
± 0.90 nm, Ra=3.03 ± 0.69 nm, Rmax=38.99 ± 8.56nm).  
 
3.2.2 Nanohardness and nano-reduced elastic modulus  
    Nanoindentation measurements were performed on single enamel rod and 
CaF2-like deposit (Fig. 3-5b, Fig. 3-6b). Based on the experimental load-unload cycle 
data, the mean nanohardness of the deposits was calculated to be 0.77 ± 0.10 GPa, 
while the reduced elastic modulus was 53.35 ± 4.63 GPa. The equivalent values of the 
original (i.e. untreated) enamel surface were 5.29 ± 0.13 GPa and 86.12 ± 1.01 GPa, 
respectively. Hence, it is apparent that the NaF treatment results in a significant 
reduction in both the nanohardness (p<0.001) and the nano-reduced elastic modulus 
(p<0.001). Following KOH extraction of the surface deposits, the underlying 
fluoride-treated enamel surface was found to have a slightly lower surface hardness 
(p<0.05) than the original native enamel.

nanoscratch tests. It is observed that the critical load for the 2% NaF+KOH surface is 
around 730 μN, while that for the native enamel and KOH alone surfaces is around 
850 μN. It is noted that these values are very similar to the critical values obtained for 
the corresponding surfaces in the static-load scratch tests. However, it can be seen that 
the friction coefficient profile of the 2% NaF surface is very different from those of 
the other three surfaces. Specifically, the coefficient of friction remains stable until a 
low critical load of just 380 μN, and then increases rapidly with increasing load. 
Through this strategy and the following measurement, we discovered that plough 
effect could significantly affect the test results in scratch model when greater than 
force 380 μN was applied. From this study, the friction coefficient remains stable 
(0.1617±0.0035) when less than a critical load of 380 μN was applied without 
significantly biased by the plough effect. In addition, it was observed that the 
coefficient of friction of the 2% NaF surface falls rapidly once the applied load 
exceeds 2190 μN, whereas that of the remaining three surfaces remains approximately 
constant. The Student’s paired t-test revealed that the coefficient of friction of the 2% 
NaF treated surface is significantly higher than that from the other three types of 
treatments (p<0.001).  
Utilizing a constant normal load of 700 μN, nanoscratch tests were performed to 
evaluate the coefficients of friction of the native enamel surface, the 2%NaF+KOH 
surface, and the KOH alone surface at scratch velocities ranging from 0.1-1 μm/s. As 
shown in Fig. 3-10, the frictional coefficient of each surface increased slightly with an 
increasing scratch velocity. Furthermore, it is apparent that the frictional coefficient of 
the 2%NaF+KOH surface is significantly higher than that of the other two groups 
(p<0.001). Note that the low surface hardness and high surface roughness properties 
of the CaF2-like deposits prevented a reliable testing of the 2% NaF surface, and thus 
the corresponding measurement results are deliberately omitted here.

typical sample. Meanwhile, Figs 3-14(a) and (b) show the 3-D AFM morphologies of 
the interfacial regions between the native enamel surface and the laser treated enamel 
surface, and the native enamel surface and the 2% NaF-treated enamel surface, 
respectively. Finally, Fig. 3-15 presents the 3-D AFM morphologies of the six 
treatment areas on a typical sample.  
The surface roughness of the laser treated enamel surface was found to be 
significantly higher (p<0.001) than that of the native enamel surface. However, an 
insignificant difference (p>0.05) was observed in the surface roughness of treatment 
regions En+L5s and En+L10s. The height of the CaF2-like deposits relative to the 
non-treated surface was found to be 550.27±84.55 nm. The surface roughness of the 
NaF surface was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that of the adjacent surface of 
native enamel.  
The results showed that there was no significant difference in the surface 
roughness of the NaF+L5s, NaF+L10s and NaF treatment regions. However, the mean 
Rq values of the NaF+L5s and NaF+L10s treatment regions were lower than that of 
the NaF region. . Furthermore, the mean Rq value of the NaF+L10s treatment region 
was lower than that of the NaF+L5s region; implying that a longer irradiation time 
results in a more extensive melting of the CaF2-like deposits.  
 
 
3.3.2 Nanohardness and elastic modulus 
Figures 3-16 (a) and (b) show the nanohardness and elastic modulus, respectively, 
of the three treatment regions on the native enamel surface. An insignificant 
difference (p>0.05) exists in the nanohardness of the En and En+L5s regions. 
However, the nanohardness of the En+L10s treatment region is significantly higher 
(p<0.05) than that of the En region. In other words, the nanohardness of the untreated 
  21
than that of the NaF region under an applied load of 400 μN, while the wear depth of 
the NaF+L10s region is 40% lower than that of the NaF region under the same 
applied load. In other words, the wear resistance of the NaF-treated enamel surface 
increases with an increasing irradiation time.  
  
 
3.3.4 EPMA analysis 
Table 4 and Figure 3-19 show the EPMA results for the fluoride (F) content test, 
namely (1) native enamel surface (En); (2) native enamel surface treated with 2% NaF 
(NaF); (3) native enamel surface treated with 2% NaF and then immersed in KOH 
(NaF+KOH); (4) NaF-treated surface irradiated for 5 s and then immersed in KOH 
(NaF+L5s+KOH); and (5) NaF-treated surface irradiated for 10 s and then immersed 
in KOH (NaF+L10s+KOH). From inspection, the F content of the NaF region 
(0.99±0.26 wt %) is approximately 2.25 times higher than that of the En region 
(0.44±0.18 wt %). The F content of the NaF+KOH surface (0.60±0.17 wt %) is 
significantly higher (p<0.05) than that of the EN surface. Similarly, the F content of 
the NaF+L5s+KOH region (0.74±0.14 wt %) is significantly higher (p<0.05) than that 
of the NaF+KOH region. However, no significant difference (p>0.05) exists in the F 
content of the NaF+L10s+KOH and NaF+L5s+KOH regions.

gradually decreasing is simulated by Nix et al. [38] to prove its advantage. Their study 
of functionally grades material exhibits higher critical loads and slower crack growth 
than non-functionally graded material. Moreover, this study correlated the decreasing 
trend of the nanohardness to the calcium content of the enamel. As shown in Fig. 3-4, 
a correlation coefficient up to 0.92 (p<0.05) was observed between the local calcium 
concentration and the in situ nanohardness. This phenomenon indicates that mineral 
content has a strong influence on nanohardness. Although the organic matrix 
comprises only about overall 1 wt % of the enamel [2], it can be postulated that the 
distribution of the organic matrix form a gradient in its concentration may attribute to 
this viscoelastic property.  
    A significant difference was observed in the friction coefficient and the mean 
scratch residual depth of the head, tail and axial-section of the rods near the outer 
enamel surface. Both tribological properties also gradually increase with an increasing 
distance from the outer enamel surface. The regression analysis results showed that 
the scratch residual depth was positively related to the topological position along the 
longitudinal axis and varied as an exponential function (coefficient of determination 
R2=0.94) of the distance from the outer enamel layer. We postulate that variation in 
the mineral concentration and the anisotropic arrangement of the hydroxyapatite 
nanocrystals in the enamel rods may play critical roles in the biomechanical 
integration of the enamel to resist mastication force and traumatic impact [39]. The 
mean scratch depth and friction coefficient values obtained when performing in a 
direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the rod are higher than those 
obtained in a parallel direction. This suggests that the direction-dependent tribological 
properties may also come from the orientation of the hydroxyapatite crystalline and 
the relative mineral concentrations and organic [23, 39-40].  
    The hydroxyapatite fiber like crystals arrangement of enamel rod is in such a 
  25
amorphous calcium fluoride-rich precipitation, i.e. 
    ( ) −−− ++→+ OHPOCaFFOHPOCa 342345 3510  
    The effects of topical fluoride application using 2 % NaF at neutral pH in 
modifying the chemical and topographical properties of enamel are thoroughly 
documented in the literature [46-50]. In general, the results of these studies indicate 
that the main products of the fluoride treatment are calcium fluoride-like deposits. The 
contributions of these deposits to anti-caries activity are well documented. Chemical 
analysis suggests that these deposits are phosphate containing calcium fluoride [51]. 
However, earlier studies found that these deposits are lost from the enamel surface 
after certain periods of time ranging from days to weeks [9]. Therefore, some 
researchers have argued that these deposits provide no more than a limited protective 
capability.  
    To the best of the current authors’ knowledge, the 3-D topographies and 
nano-mechanical properties presented in this study are not reported elsewhere in the 
literature. The surface deposits formed on the enamel surface following 4 min of a 
common topical fluoride treatment have a mountain-like morphology with a mean 
diameter of 1.14 ± 0.84μm and a mean height of 207.67 ± 0.84nm. This observation is 
consistent with the findings of previous SEM studies [49], which reported a mean 
diameter of approximately 1 μm.  
    Furthermore, using a nanoindentation technique, this study has overcome the 
problem of the substrate effect [52-57] and has successfully isolated the nano-scale 
mechanical properties of individual CaF2 surface deposits. The topographical 
mapping of the surface fluoride deposits revealed that a near flat surface was probed. 
The calculated results showed that the discrepancy in the measured nanohardness 
between the deposit surfaces and an idea flat surface is only about 2%. In this study, 
  27
to previous study by Ben Daia et al in 2000 [52], to avoid significant effect of surface 
roughness on the mechanical property measurements, the average surface roughness 
must be less than 20 % of the indentation depth. The indentation depth in this study is 
about 76.67 ± 2.96 nm and the Rq is 3.12 ± 1.30 nm. The calculated ratio is 4.1 %, 
which is way less than 20%. For layered structure, the study of Gamonpilas and Busso 
(2004) [57] indicates the importance of indentation depth. For soft coating material on 
a hard substrate (i.e. σyc /σys < 1), the relative indentation depth could be 30 % of the 
film thickness without being significantly biased by the presence of the underlying 
substrate as plastic deformation is generally confined within the coating material [57]. 
In this study, the film thickness is 523.90 ± 43.00 nm and the indentation depth is 
71.23 ± 2.11 nm. The calculated ratio is 14 % and is less than 30%. Therefore, the 
experiment should not be significantly affected by the substrate effect. 
    Since the thickness of the surface clusters is in the nanometer scale, previous 
studies using microhardness techniques could be significantly influenced by the 
underlying substrate [58]. For example, the current results reveal that the CaF2-like 
deposits have a nanohardness of 0.77 ± 0.10 GPa while the non-treated enamel 
surface has a nanohardness of 5.29 ± 0.13 GPa. The value of 0.77 ± 0.10 GPa for the 
nanohardness of the deposits is significantly lower than the value of 2.63 ± 0.23 GPa 
obtained using a microindentation technique in a previous study [58]. Furthermore, 
the hardness of the CaF2-like deposits obtained via microindentation was found to be 
similar to that of the native enamel surface, i.e. 2.73 ± 0.28 GPa. However, in the 
present study, the hardness of the deposits is significantly lower than that of the 
non-treated enamel surface. Hence, it appears that the microhardness results presented 
in the literature are indeed influenced by the substrate effect. Additionally, the lower 
hardness of the non-treated enamel surface obtained via microindentation may 
indicate that the measurement result includes both the mantle and the underlying layer 
  29
surface modified Au(111)/Si(100) surfaces increases as the velocity of the applied 
force increases [60-62].  
    In the tribological wear tests performed in this study, the nanowear 
measurements were obtained at the centers of the worn enamel rods. It is known that 
the hydroxyapatite nanocrystals which constitute the enamel rods are oriented in a 
direction perpendicular to the enamel surface in this particular region of the rod. The 
3-D AFM topography mappings presented in Fig. 3-11(a) have revealed a significant 
difference in the morphologies of the wear scar surfaces of the 2% NaF specimens 
compared to those of the other three surface types. Specifically, the passage of the 
AFM tip over the CaF2-like surface deposits prompts a significant plastic deformation 
of the treated surface and results in a “ploughing effect”. Thus, as shown in Fig. 
3-11(b), the 2% NaF surface has a significantly higher mean wear depth than the 
native enamel surface, the 2% NaF+KOH surface or the KOH alone surface, 
respectively. It is known that the CaF2-like deposits on the enamel surface have an 
amorphous and loosely-packed structure [62], and thus the relatively poor nanowear 
resistance observed in the present study for this particular surface is not unexpected. 
Overall, the present results have shown that the CaF2-like deposits have a 
non-uniform surface nanostructure, a high wear depth, and a high coefficient of 
friction. Moreover, the wear depth increases approximately linearly with an increasing 
applied load and is found to have a value of around six times that of the native enamel 
surface under an applied load of 300 μN (Fig. 3-11(b)). In addition, the results have 
shown that a negative correlation exists between the nanohardness of the four treated 
surfaces and their corresponding mean wear depth values (Fig.3-12). 
    The microstructures and chemical compositions of the enamel rods and CaF2-like 
deposits are significantly different, and therefore result in major differences in their 
respective nanohardness and nanowear properties. As discussed above, enamel rods 
  31
since the CaF2-like deposits on the enamel surface were rapidly eroded. In the 1970s, 
laser was also suggested for caries remedy. Since that time, the feasibility of 
integrating topical fluoride treatment with a laser irradiation process to create an 
effective caries prevention protocol has attracted significant attention in the dental 
healthcare field [15].              
    The SEM images presented in Fig. 3-13 show that the sheaths in the enamel 
surface morphology shrink following irradiation and have a lower height than that of 
the enamel rods. This result is to be expected since the sheaths have a relatively 
higher protein content than the rods, and this protein decomposes rapidly under the 
effects of the intense heat generated in the irradiation process. In addition, the SEM 
images show that the surfaces of the irradiated specimens contain a small number of 
fissure-like features caused by water evaporation and organic decomposition under 
irradiation. As shown in the 3-D AFM images in Fig. 3-15, the laser treatment also 
results in a slight melting of the enamel rod surfaces.  
Although the irradiated surfaces contain a small number of fissures, they are 
generally free of severe morphological alterations such as craters, crack and pores. In 
other words, the present results are consistent with the findings in [64] that a pulsed, 
low-energy-density laser source causes minimal damage to the enamel surface. As for 
the energy density of 732 mJ/㎝ 2 would enough make CaF2-like deposits melting. 
From AFM roughness analysis, it revealed the CaF2-like deposits melted. Meanwhile, 
the SEM images in Fig. 3-13 show that the laser irradiation process prompts the 
formation of rod-like structures in the treated fluoride surface. 
   The results presented in Fig 3-16(a) show that the nanohardness of the native 
enamel surface increases significantly following laser irradiation for 10 s. The 
phenomenon was obviously the inverse Hall-Petch effect that average crystal size and 
dimensions was proportional to the hardness and elastic modulus. In practice, human 
  33
and 3-15 suggest that the greater nanohardness of the CaF2-like deposits following 
irradiation is a result of a greater densification (i.e. a lower porosity). The elastic 
modulus follows the same tendency of the model encountered with hardness. The 
porosity still plays important role than crystal size in affecting the elastic modulus 
[67].  
The results presented in Fig. 3-17(a) show that the nanohardness of the CaF2-like 
deposits increases by a factor of more than two following laser irradiation. Meanwhile, 
Fig. 3-18(b) shows that the laser irradiation process improves the wear resistance of 
the CaF2-like deposits by at least 34% increasing. In other words, the present results 
are consistent with those presented in [68], in which it was shown that the wear 
resistance and hardness of tooth enamel are directly related to one another.   
The EPMA results obtained in this study show that following the KOH extraction 
process, the F content on the NaF-treated surface is around 37% higher than that on 
the native enamel surface (see Fig. 3-19). In [32], it was argued that the uptake of 
fluoride on the extracted enamel surface is due to a migration of the fluoride elements 
into the collagen component of the enamel crystals and the possible formation of 
fluorapatites. The results presented in Fig. 3-18 show that laser irradiation improve 
the fluoride uptake on the extracted enamel surface by around 23%. As reported in 
[33], it can be inferred that the laser irradiation process seals the collagen in the 
enamel crystals, thereby preventing the F elements from migrating into the liquid 
phase, and therefore prompts the formation of firmly-bound fluoride.  
 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
  35
  3. Laser irradiation results in a significant improvement in the fluoride uptake 
    on the enamel surface.
