mask at a sublimation pressure of 6  10−6 Torr. The channel
length L and width W of the PEM devices were 100 and
2000 m, respectively. The current–voltage I-V and capacitance–
voltage were measured using a semiconductor parameter analyzer
Keithley 4200-SCS in a dark glove box under a nitrogen atmo-
sphere.
Results and Discussion
Figure 2 illustrates the transfer characteristics of the pentacene-
based PEM devices with the PVA PVA-device and PMMA
PMMA-device layers, respectively. PEM devices are based on
p-type OTFTs, and thus their electrical parameters, such as threshold
voltage Vth, and on/off ratio, can be acquired from the conven-
tional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor MOSFET
equation.14 When the source–drain voltage VDS was fixed at −8 V
and the VGS varied from 0–8 V, the electrical curves of the PVA-
devices Fig. 2a exhibited a smaller drain current IDS, lower on/
off ratio, and more negative Vth than the PMMA-devices Fig. 2b.

devices with PVA and PMMA layers, respectively, after continuous
multiple writing/erasing W/E cycles operating at an applied pulse
time of 1 s. The memory windows of the PVA-devices exhibited a
considerable degradation only after several cycles of operation. This
means that part of the charges stored in the traps could not be totally
erased due to long-lifetime traps or unreleased traps. More impor-
tantly, the memory windows of the PMMA-devices could still be
maintained while conducting endurance testing. This suggests that
the charge carriers could be easily trapped and detrapped in the
PMMA-devices under our testing conditions, thus indicating excel-
lent endurance properties.
Finally, we discuss the correlation between the memory effects
of PEM devices and the structure of the polymer’s electret layers
and pentacene layer. The surface morphologies of the PVA and
PMMA layers are shown in Figs. 7a and 7b, respectively. For refer-
ence, the corresponding surface morphologies of the pentacene films
are shown in Figs. 7c and 7d, respectively. The surface roughness of
the PVA layer was considerably larger than that of the PMMA layer
see Table I, thus providing a reasonable explanation for the large
Vth shift at the initial state. Steudel et al.16 suggested that the rough-
ness minima of the gate dielectric behave like charge traps because
crossing the valleys is slow and difficult, thus causing a mobility
degradation and the shift of the Vth in pentacene OTFTs with a
silicon dioxide SiO2 dielectric. Suemori et al.17 observed the en-
larged Vth shift in pentacene OTFTs with rough SiO2 dielectrics and
attributed it to the lattice distortion in the pentacene layers deposited
on the rough surfaces. We believe that these proposed ideas will
hold true for the polymer electret layers. However, for polymer in-
sulators, the chemical structure and/or functional group is another
concern. The surface free energy s, including dispersion d
s and
polar p
s force components, of the PVA and PMMA layers was
determined from the contact angle measurements18 using water and
diiodomethane. The results are listed in Table I. The large p
s value
of the PVA surface reflects the contribution from the polar –OH
groups Fig. 1. The distribution of trap states has been suggested to
be influenced by polar functional groups.19 Lee et al.20 observed that
a large hysteresis problem occurs with the increase in hydroxyl
bindings in the polymeric dielectric. The abovementioned observa-
tions provide a support for the larger amounts of shallow traps lo-
cated in the pentacene/PVA interface and/or within pentacene films
than those in the PMMA cases. Based on the retention and endur-
ance testing results, clearly such traps in the PVA devices cannot
sustain stable memory windows.
The electrical memory characteristics of the PMMA-devices in-
dicate that most of the traps are localized in the PMMA layer.
PMMA is an amorphous polymer, whereas PVA is a semicrystalline
polymer. The free volume i.e., volume associated with vacancies in
PMMA is larger than that in PVA.21 Previously, we observed that the
vacancy in polymer films could act as charge traps, thus causing a
significant Vth shift i.e., electrical hysteresis in polymer thin film
transistor TFT.22 Therefore, the free volume vacancy-related
charge trap is a possible source for deep traps in the PMMA layer.
Conclusions
In summary, after combining high-k HfO2 and polymer electret
layers, we have successfully fabricated a low-voltage-operated
pentacene-based organic nonvolatile memory using a low-
temperature fabrication process   200°C. The memory charac-
teristics of PEM devices with two kinds of polymer electret layers
i.e., a strong polar PVA and an amorphous PMMA were studied.
By applying writing voltage with varying pulse times, we found that
the memory windows of the PVA-devices and the PMMA-devices
were dominated by the shallow-type and deep-type traps, respec-
tively. According to the long-time retention and multiple W/E cycle
endurance testing, the memory windows of the PMMA-devices are
much more stable and reliable than those of the PVA-devices, al-
though the PVA-devices have relatively larger memory windows
before testing. We propose that the large amount of shallow-type
traps in the PVA devices was created due to the rough pentacene/
PVA interface, strong polar –OH groups in the PVA layer. The more
free volume vacancies within the PMMA layer provide a possible
origin for the long lifetime deep-type traps in the PMMA-devices.
Consequently, choosing the appropriate polymer insulators for the
electret layer and optimizing its structural properties and interface
with organic semiconductors are crucial to improving the memory
properties of high-performance PEM devices, thus expanding their
potential in various applications.

This study reports on polymorphic transformations in
pentacene thin films driven by solvent drop evaporation. By
means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy,
absorption spectroscopy, and quantum mechanical calcula-
tions, the structural, optical, and electronic properties of
solvent-treated and untreated pentacene films, as well as a
detailed route of polymorphic transformations, are provided.
The experiments provide an excellent foundation for further
understanding of this system. The study can help predict the
potential ability for charge transport and electronic properties
of organic molecules in different crystal polymorphs. Inter-
esting results can be derived through a joint experimental and
theoretical approach. After treatment with some organic
solvents, pentacene films may provide superior molecular,
structural, and electronic properties. This is contrary to the
results for untreated films. Excellent agreements are found
between the experimental data and the theoretical predica-
tions described above.
Experimental Section
Preparation of Pentacene Films. Pentacene films of thickness ca.
40-50 nm (Aldrich Chemical Co., used as received) were thermally
evaporated on the O2 plasma (Diener Femto, 50 W, 2 min)-treated
indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass substrate. The deposition rate was
approximately 0.05 nm s-1; a pressure of 2 10-5 Torr was applied,
and the substrate was maintained at room temperature. The thick-
nesses of pentacene films were calibrated using an atomic force
microscope (Digital Instrument Multimode SPM AS-12VMF) and
were monitored via the frequency shift of a quartz oscillator. The
surface energy (γs) of ITO was determined by contact angle mea-
surements (OCA-15 Plus, DataPhysics). Solvent treatment: Four
kinds of aromatic solvents were used, including chlorobenzene
(CB), toluene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), andp-xylene.Thedielectric
constant (εs), dipole moment (μD), and solubility parameters
19 of
these solvents are listed in Table 1. All the solvents (HPLC grade)
were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as received.
The pure solvent of ca. 0.3 mL was dropped at the center of the
pentacene film substrate (1 cm  1 cm). Then, the solvent was
immediately removed by spin-coating with the rate 3000 rpm for
30 s. After the spin-coating process, the sample was baked at 120 C
for 10 min to remove the residual solvent.
Characterization.TheXRD spectra were recorded with a Rigaku
D/Max-2500 diffractometer in the symmetric reflection coupled
θ-2θ arrangement by using a 18 kW rotating-anode X-ray gen-
erator (Cu KR radiation, λKR1 = 1.5406 A˚) and a wide-angle
graphite monochromator. The data were collected with a step size
of 0.01 with a scanning rate of 1/min. A Si single-crystal (111)
wafer was used to estimate the effect of the instrumental broadening
in XRD experiments. The observed full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) of the (111) peak at ca. 28 2θ is 0.061 under the same
instrumental conditions. The Raman spectra were measured via a
Jobin Yvon/Labram HRU1000 micro-Raman spectrometer. A 633
nm He-Ne laser and a 532 nm solid state laser served as the
excitation light source and were kept below 0.5 mW to prevent
thermal damage to the pentacene films. The spectrometer resolu-
tions are 0.2 cm-1 and 0.4 cm-1 for using 633 and 532 nm excitation
lines, respectively. Every Raman spectrum was an average of five
spectra, and at least three spectra were measured for each sample.
The fwhmof the individual Raman bands were determined by curve
fitting usingmixedGaussian and Lorentzian line shapes (in PeakFit
v. 4.11, SYSTAT Software Inc.). The absorption spectra were
recorded using a GBC, Cintra 202 UV/vis spectrophotometer. At
least three spectra were measured for each sample.
Quantum Chemical Calculations. The geometry of the pentacene
monomerwas first optimized using density functional theory (DFT)
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. This frozen monomer
geometry was then used for single point energy (SPE) and solvent
effect calculations of the dimers. The total SPEs of these dimerswere
studied using the second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation (MP2)
theory at the same basis set. Themolecules are fixed at the respective
positions based on the input separation distance (d) of the dimers to
represent the actual arrangements of the real crystal polymorph
without further optimization. The calculated binding energy (ΔEb)
at theMP2 level was corrected for a basis set superposition error by
using the Counter-Poise method.20 For the embedded-cluster
calculations, we fixed the positions of the surrounding molecules
and embedded molecule by freezing their coordinates according to
lattice parameters of various polymorphic structures, including the
virtual transition states. The approach allows us to simulate the
actual local embedding environment of the real polymorph. Next,
we relaxed the geometry of the embedded molecules in order to
obtain the stabilized (optimized) structures in the presence of
surroundingmolecules by using theCoulomb-attenuatingmethod21
(CAM-B3LYP) with the 6-31G(d) level of theory. The CAM-
B3LYP method is an improved long-range corrected version of
B3LYP.21 Then, the SPEs of the embedded and nonembedded
molecules were calculated using CAM-B3LYP with triple-ζ plus
polarization quality basis sets. The electronic transition energies
were calculated using time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The elec-
tronic coupling between adjacent pentacene molecules in various
dimer configurations was calculated using Zerner’s intermediate
neglect of differential overlap (ZINDO/S) Hamiltonian. Møller-
Plesset perturbation calculations employing the 6-31G(d) basis set
in conjunction with the integral equation formalism polarizable
continuum model (IEFPCM) at the self-consistent reaction field
(SCRF)were used to account for solvent effects. All the calculations
were performed using the Gaussian suite of programs.22
Results and Discussion
Solvent Effects and Polymorphic Transformations. Figure 1a
shows the XRD spectrum of the present pentacene film.
The film shows crystallographically textured and grain
morphology, with preferential ordering of the spacing direc-
tion (00l0) normal to the substrate. Thus, this indicates a
layered structure, and the calculated interlayer d001-spacing
is 15.36( 0.06 A˚. This has been previously observed in most
pentacene films deposited on various substrates.4-12 Based
on the (0010) peak at 5.75 ( 0.02 2θ, results indicate a
dominant polymorph T in the films. Polymorph T is well-
known in literature and usually found in low thickness films
grown on substrates.7-10 Previously, we developed a growth
model10 to explain why polymorph T appears at low thick-
ness. We found that it is because of the greater flatness of the
substrate surface. With the increased thickness of the films,

phase. For the initial films, the mean dimension of the
crystallites perpendicular to the (00l) plane (L00L) of poly-
morphT (LT) is 257( 5 A˚, according to paracrystal theory23
andwith the repetition of a previously usedmethodology.4,15
After the transformation of T to B phase driven by solvent
treatments, the decreased intensity of diffraction peaks,
which is associated with a decrease in L00L (e.g., 208 ( 10 A˚
of polymorph B (LB) in CB-treated film), suggests that some
of the pentacene molecules may have been washed out. To
further explore crystal quality during polymorphic transfor-
mation from T to B, the microstrains in pentacene films are
estimated by using a Williamson-Hull plot [fwhm  cos(θ)
versus sin(θ)].24 The initial films show a microstrain of 0.143
((0.024)% for polymorph T. In particular, the microstrain
of the formed polymorph B in CB-treated pentacene film is
only 0.004%, suggesting a reduced crystalline disorder.
Although the postannealing method is a common approach
to improve the structural quality of organic films,1 poly-
morph B remains difficult to obtain through heating.18,25
The reported values of the lattice parameters for thin-
film polymorph T are different from those of polymorph
B.6,7,12,25-27 The tilt angle, θtilt, is defined as the angle from
the c axis to the a axis. It is calculated from the d001-spacing
by using a molecular length of 16.2 A˚.6a The tilt angle of the
pentacene molecule in polymorph B is ca. 28—larger than
that in polymorph T, which is ca. 18 (Scheme 1). In a unit
cell, the d between adjacent pentacene molecules can be
obtained from the in-plane lattice parameters (a, b, and
γ values) and θtilt:
10
d ¼ 0:5½ða sin γÞ2þðb- a cos γÞ21=2  cos θtilt ð1Þ
Byadopting the in-plane lattice parameters in the literature6,25-27
and θtilt from experimental XRD data, the d in polymorph T
is estimated to be 4.53( 0.016 A˚, which is longer than that in
polymorph B (4.25( 0.013 A˚). The d in polymorph B driven
by solvents is also shorter than that formed at large
thickness10 and near polycrystalline grain boundaries with
concave surfaces,13 assigned here to polymorph HB. With
the increase of film thickness, the d001-spacing of polymorph
HB changes gradually from 14.9 A˚ to 14.5 A˚,10,13 which
corresponds to d values from 4.41 A˚ down to 4.30 A˚.
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing
themolecular packing andmicrostructure of organic films,10,15
including crystalline and amorphous (disordered) regions, as
well as charge-vibrational coupling of organic molecules.28,29
Parts a and b of Figure 2 show the Raman spectra of pentacene
films before and after CB treatment, respectively. After
solvent treatments, a significant decrease in intensity ofC-H
in-plane vibrations (at 1150-1180 cm-1) is observed relative
to that ofC-Caromatic vibrations at 1350-1380 cm-1 (I1178/
I1371, also observed for other solvents, Supporting Information,
Figure S1). For pentacene, the interlayer structure depends
on the relative multitude of C-HandC-C interactions.6a,10
Thus, the reduced vibration of the H-atoms of pentacene in
the solvent-treated film reflects the close packing of mole-
cules and relative small amount of the amorphous part,
providing proof of reduced d values throughout the films.
Apart from the crystalline forms of the pentacene molecules,
other amorphous forms may also be present in the film. Due
to lack of significant intermolecular interactions of amorphous
molecules, we expected an increase in intensity (freedom) of
the C-H vibrations. In Figure 2, the CB-treated film also
shows a considerably reduced fwhm for the strongest C-H
in-plane and C-C stretching vibrations at 1178 and 1371
cm-1, respectively (Figure 2), suggesting reduction of dis-
order (inhomogeneous broadening). Moreover, the smaller
fwhm of the bands, which largely contributed to the charge
transfer reorganization energy, is also an indicator of lower
energy consumption in charge-vibrational coupling.10,28,29
XRD results (Figure 1) showed that solvent-treated pentacene
films have a lower thickness due to some of the washed
out pentacene molecules. Compared with the spectra of
pentacene films with low thickness (without solvent-
treatments),10 a large decrease in the values of I1178/I1371
and the significant narrowing of the fwhm of these vibra-
tional modes for the solvent-treated films were observed.
Thus, we deduced that more large parts of molecules in the
amorphous regions were washed out compared with those in
the crystalline regions.
The increased θtilt in solvent-treated films could be further
verified by detecting the C-C aromatic vibration at 1597
cm-1 (calculated at 1649 cm-1,B3g), which is related to three
aromatic ring vibrations located at the center of pentacene.10
An increased intensity of the band is observed for the
solvent-treated films [Figure 2b, excitation energy (λexc) of
532 nm]. The CB-treated film also shows a relatively larger
value of I1597/I1371 (0.51) compared with that of the 300 nm
thick pentacene film containing polymorph HB at a large
thickness of I1597/I1371 ∼ 0.33.10
Quantum chemical calculations within the framework of
the MP2 theory were performed. This would allow us to
study the stability of pentacene dimers adopting the herring-
bone packing motif, as in polymorphs T and B (herein,
referred to as “T-dimer” and “B-dimer”), or in short, the
study of polymorphic transformations. For the pentacene
crystal, the dimer structure is categorized as a basic unit
because there are two molecules in the unit cell. The MP2
method has been widely used for studying binding or stabi-
lization energies (ΔEb) between aromatic molecules, such as
benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, pyrrole, and pyrimidine

(a) and after (b) CB treatments. In the 1550-1650 cm-1 region, 532
nm excited spectra were shown. The I1178/I1371 and I1597/I1371
denoted the intensity ratio of 1178 and of 1597 to 1371 cm-1,
respectively. The fwhm of 1178 and 1371 cm-1 bands were also
shown. Note: The DFT computation of the Raman spectrum of
pentacene was also shown, and the calculated frequencies were
scaled with a factor of 0.9613. Only Ag modes are labeled. The
calculated contribution (percent) to the charge-vibrational reorga-
nization energy (λ) of the 1178 and 1371 cm-1 bands is also shown.

From the solubility parameters of these solvents (Table 1),
making an accurate forecast regarding the degree of poly-
morphic transformation in pentacene films seems difficult.
To evaluate the effect of the solvent surrounding pentacene,
SCRF calculations were performed using the MP2 method.
The calculated results are listed in Table 2. The CB solvent
has the largest polarized pentacene-solvent interaction
energy (Wpen-sol), providing a reasonable explanation for the
near-complete polymorphic transformations from T to B.
According to the IEFPCM,31 the solvent was treated as a
polarizable continuum with a dielectric constant εs, instead
of explicit solvent molecules. Toluene has a slightly higher εs
value than TCB. A slightly higher fB in toluene-treated films
is also observed, in spite of TCB having higher μD and
solubility parameters. Then, a comparison of solvent effects
was made between p-xylene and TCB, which, in this case,
have similar εs values. The significantly low fB, driven by
p-xylene, may be because it has no μD.
Previously, Gundlach et al.32 dipped pentacene films with
polymorph T into high polar or hydrogen-bonded solvents,
such as acetone and isopropanol, and detected that poly-
morph T changed almost completely into polymorph B.
Mattheus et al.6b repeated the experiments reported by
Gundlach et al. and commented that it was not clear whether
polymorph T transformed into polymorph B or the film had
become amorphous because of some material loss in the
process. In the present study, solvent-induced polymorphic
transformations of pentacene films seem to have been suc-
cessfully interpreted in terms of εs, according to the IEFPCM
model. Acetone (εs = 21) and isopropanol (εs = 18) both
have high values of εs and μD (Table 1). The SCRF calcula-
tions suggest a relatively high Wpen-sol (Table 2). The large
Wpen-sol can force polymorphic transformation from T to B
but also increases the risk of washing out pentacene mole-
cules. In support, Figure 4 shows a dramatic decrease in the
XRD intensity of pentacene films after treatment with acetone
and isopropanol.
To establish the hypothesis for the solvent effect on
polymorphic transformations of insoluble organic films,
the values ofWpen-sol from different solvents (Table 2) were
compared to the ΔEb of the dimer (Table 3). For toluene,
TCB, and p-xylene, the observed Wpen-sol is only slightly
larger than that of ΔEb. Therefore, incomplete polymorphic
transformation from T to B is observed upon solvent treat-
ments. When CB was used as the solvent, Wpen-sol is more
than twice as large as theΔEb. Thus,Wpen-sol is large enough
to drive a complete polymorphic transformation. For acetone
and isopropanol, excessively largeWpen-sol (over three times
that of ΔEb) may destroy the polymorphic structure. Thus,
these create some amorphous or disorder regions in the films.
These observations can also interpret why the presence of the
solvent has introduced a level of disorder and caused some
irreversible degradation of pentacene films during solvent
vapor annealing in acetone.33 In effect, the proposed hypo-
thesis on the solvent-assisted structural modifications may
be applicable for other organic molecular crystals/films.
However, the hypothesis ignores other effects, e.g., kinetics,
crystal size and shape, surface effects, evaporation rate, and
so on.
Relation to Optical and Electronic Properties. We first
focus on the μD difference between the isolated monomer,
PFF dimers, and herringbone dimers of pentacene mole-
cules, because the μD can become essential in electronic and
photoelectronic devices because of an enhanced dipole-electric
field interaction that can occur and thus affect optical
and electrical properties. For pentacene, the isolated mono-
mer and PFF-dimer (regardless of d value) do not have
dipoles. However, MP2 calculations indicated an increased
μD after forming herringbone dimers, from 1.396 D of the
T-dimer to 1.660 D of the B-dimer. Consequently, theo-
retical calculations support previous observations14,18 that
the formation of the herringbone motif of pentacene dimers
can induce an extra dipole to help intermolecular bonding,
thus stabilizing B and T structures. That means that the
intermolecular bonding between pentacene molecules is a
result of dipole-dipole interactions and weak van derWaals
interactions. K€afer et al. have also pointed out the impor-
tance of the balance between electrostatic and van derWaals
interactions on the packing in organic molecular crystals.34
Evidently, aDavydov splitting, which arises from the dipole-
dipole interaction35 of the π-π* transition (S0f S1 band) at
ca. 1.5-2.0 eV in the absorption spectra of pentacene films,
has been reported.36,37 Figure 5 shows that the CB-treated
film (containing polymorph B) has a larger splitting (β) of
124 ((3.1) meV compared to that of the initial films
(containing polymorph T), which have a splitting of 110
((2.5) meV. This result suggests increased intermolecular
dipole-dipole interactions in polymorph B. The observa-
tions can be supported through electronic structural calcula-
tions of the T-dimer and B-dimer by using a TD-DFT
approach. The TD-DFT approach is an extension of the
ground-state DFT to the treatment of excitations or time-
dependent phenomena. It has now become increasingly
popular for predicting optical absorption spectra. The cal-
culated electronic transitions of the two dimers were also
plotted in Figure 5. The B-dimer shows an enlarged splitting
compared with that of the T-dimer. Furthermore, amorphous

    這趟日本學術之行，是本人第一次出國，行前一個月便
與旅行社洽妥至日本福岡的來回機票與接駁交通車，同時先行
規劃目的地交通與學術參觀的動向，才讓這次行程能夠順利落

IDW＇10 發給的注意事項與交通資訊，我跟學長兩人就這樣飛
抵九洲福岡國際空港。直到下榻的飯店，在短短的交通路程中，
環境與空間帶給我的印象就是快速、乾淨、守秩序與舒服。無
怪乎日本是國人最嚮往居住或旅遊的地方之一。
