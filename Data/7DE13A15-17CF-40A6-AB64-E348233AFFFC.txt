Abstract— In this paper, the network expanded problem (NEP)
which optimally assigns new adding and splitting cells in PCS
(Personal Communication Service) network to switches in an
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) network is studied. In NEP,
the locations of cells (or Base Stations, BSs) in PCS network
are fixed and known, but new switches should be installed to
ATM network and the topology of the backbone network may
be changed. Given some potential sites of new switches, the
problem is to determine how many switches should be added to
the backbone network, the locations of new switches, the topology
of the new backbone network, and the assignments of new adding
and splitting cells in the PCS to switches of the new ATM
backbone network in an optimal manner. The goal is to do the
expansion in an attempt to minimize the total communication cost
under budget and capacity constraints. The NEP is modelled as a
complex integer programming problem. Since finding an optimal
solution to this problem is Impractical. A heuristic algorithm,
a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, and a genetic algorithm
are proposed to solve this problem. In the proposed algorithms,
several heuristics are encoded into the perturbation to generate
good solutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
algorithms can get better performance.
I. INTRODUCTION
The rapid worldwide growth of digital wireless communi-
cation services motivate a new generation of mobile switching
networks (such as wireless ATM [1]) to serve as infrastructure
for such services. In the architecture which based on wireless
ATM presented in [1], the base stations (BSs or cells) were
directly connected to the ATM switches. In the process of
designing PCS (Personal Communication Service) network,
first, the telephone company determined the global service
area(GSA) and divided the GSA into several smaller coverage
areas. For each area, a BS was established and connected to a
switch of the backbone network to form a two-level wireless
ATM network. This topology may be out of date since more
users may joint and use the PCS. Some areas not been covered
may have users needed to be served. The service demands of
some areas may increase and exceed the capacities provided
by the BSs and switches. Though, the wireless ATM system
should be expanded so that the PCS can provide better quality
of services to users. Two methods can be used to expand the
capacities of system: (1) adding new cells to the wireless ATM
network so that those non-covered areas can be covered by new
cells; (2) reducing the size of the cell so that the capacity of
the system can be increased. In practice, this can be achieved
Fig. 1. Example of the network expanded problem in the two layers wireless
ATM network.
by using cell splitting [2] process. The cell splitting process
establishes new BSs at specific points in the PCS and reduces
the cell size by a factor of 2 (or more).
For the given two-level wireless ATM network, cells in PCS
are divided into two sets. One is the set of cells which are
built originally and assigned to fixed switches on the ATM
network. The other is the set of cells which are newly added or
established by performing the cell splitting process. Moreover,
the locations of all cells in PCS network are fixed and known,
but the number of switches in ATM network may be increased.
Given some potential sites of new switches, the capacity of the
switch, and the designing budget, the problem is to determine
the number of switches should be added to the backbone
network, the locations of the new switches, the connections
between the new switches and original backbone network,
and the assignment of new and splitting cells in the PCS to
switches in an optimal manner. The goal is to do the expansion
in an attempt to minimize the objective cost under budget and
capacity constraints.
For the cell assignment problem (CAP), Merchant and
Sengupta [3] considered the CAP problem. In [4], [5], this
model of CAP was extended. Moreover, in [6], the extended
switches sk and sl on G(S,E). The objective function is :

that represents the link status between two switches sk and sl.
If ekl=1 then there is a link between two switches sk and sl
(sk, sl ∈ Sold∪Snew); ekl=0, otherwise. Let uik be link setup
cost of constructing the connection between cell ci,(i = n+1,
n + 2, ..., n + n′) and switch sk(k=1, 2, ..., m + m′), and
assume uik is the function of Euclidean distance between cell
ci and switch sk. Let vkl be link setup cost of constructing
the connection between switch sk and switch sl,(k, l=1, 2, ...,

between switch sk and switch sl. Define eoldkl =1 if there is a
backbone link in Gold; eoldkl =0, otherwise for k, l =1, 2, ...,m.

III. OUTLINE OF SOLUTION ALGORITHM
In general, the network expanded problem is a multi-
constraints optimization problem; in fact, it is an NP-hard
problem. That is, for the practical problem with a modest
number of nodes, only approximate solutions can be obtained
through heuristic algorithms. In this paper, a heuristic algo-
rithm is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed heuristic
algorithm consists of four phases, they are Remaining Ca-
pacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP), Cell Clustering Phase
(CCP), Switch Selection Phase (SSP), and Backbone Design
Phase (BDP).
• Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP): In
the Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP),
the remaining capacities of the old switches are used
to assign cells so as to reduce the cost for setting new
switches. Some cells in Cnew are assigned to old switches
with sparse capacities.
• Cell Clustering Phase (CCP): In the Cell Clustering
Phase (CCP), new cells in Cnew not yet been assigned
in RCCP are grouped into clusters according to some
grouping criterions so as to reduce the location update
cost between cells.
• Switch Selection Phase (SSP): In the Switch Selection
Phase, for each cluster obtained by performing CCP, a
new switch is to be established and provided services
to cells in the same cluster. The locations of the new
switches are formed the given candidate sites. Moreover,
new cells in the cluster are connected to the correspond-
ing new switch. The link between new switch and the
nearest switch in Sold is connected. After performing this
phase, each cell is assigned to a switch and a constraint-
satisfied (or feasible) solution is found.
• Backbone Design Phase (BDP): In the Backbone Design
Phase, the feasible solution obtained by performing previ-
ous phases will be improved. In this phase, new switches
may be re-connected to old switches or new switches.
Moreover, cell-exchange and backbone link appending
techniques are proposed and used to reduce the objective
cost under budget constraint.
IV. HEURISTIC ALGORITHM FOR NEP
A. Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase(RCPP)
In the Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP),
the remaining capacities of old switches are used to assign new
cells so as to reduce the cost for setting new switches. Some
cells in Cnew are assigned to switches in Cold. To determine
the cell assignment, the proposed algorithm is described as
follows:
First, some notations used in the following subsections are
introduced. Given m sets of cells Pl, l=1, 2, ..., m, assume
P1 ∪ P2 ∪ ... ∪ Pm = Cold and Pi ∩ Pj = φ, where i 6= j,
i, j=1, 2, ..., m. Without loss of generality, assume that cells
in set Pj are assigned to the switch sj , j=1, 2, ..., m. Let
sid(ci) = l if ci is in Pl, l is called the sid of cell ci. Let
LUCS(i, l) =
∑
cj∈Pl wij be the sum of the location update
costs between cell ci and all cells in Pl which is assigned
to switch sl ∈ Sold. Therefore, for a given partition P , the
location update (handoff) cost of the partition is:
α
∑
ci∈C
∑
sl∈S
(LUCS(i, l) ·Dsid(ci)l). (7)
To evaluate the effect of cell ci in Cnew being assigned
to switch sk ∈ Sold, the cabling and location update costs
derived from this event should be computed. By the definition
described above, the cabling cost of the cell assignment is lik.
Two cases should be considered in computing the location
update cost caused by the assignment, the first case is the
location update cost between cell ci and cells in Cold; the
other case is the location update costs between cell ci and the
other cells in Cnew. Since the cell assignment of the cell in
Cold is fixed and known, if cell ci in Cnew is assigned to sk,
the location update cost between the cell ci and the cell cj in
Cold is fixed and can be computed by
Let Hik be the cabling cost occurred in the ith cluster which
is assigned to switch sk, then Hik =
∑
∀ cj∈cluster i ljk. It is
worth to notice that the location update cost between cells in
the same cluster are ignored. The cost should be considered
is the location update cost between switches. Given (m+m′)
nonempty sets of cells P = {Pl}, l = 1, 2, ..., (m+m′), P
is called a (m + m′)-way partition of CG, if P1 ∪ P2 ∪
... ∪ Pm+m′ = Cnew ∪ Cold = C and Pi ∩ Pj = φ,
where i 6= j. Without loss of generality, the cells in set
Pj are assigned to switch sj , j = 1, 2, ..., (m + m′). Then
for a given partition P , the location update cost of the
partition is: α
∑
ci∈C
∑
sl∈S(LUCS(i, l) · Dsid(ci)l). If the
assignments of cells to switches are fixed and known, the
location update cost between switches is also fixed. Let
LUSS(k, l) =
∑
ci∈Pk LUCS(i, l), if k 6= l; LUSS(k, l) =0,
otherwise. Then the location update cost can be represented
as
∑m
k=1
∑m
l=1 LUSS(k, l)×Dkl.
The cells in C = Cnew ∪Cold can be divided into two sets
denoted as Cnew1 and C \ Cnew1 . The cell assignment of cell
in C \Cnew1 is known. Thus, the location update cost between
cluster i (whose cells are in Cnew1 ) and the cell in C \ Cnew1
can be computed by
Iik = α (10)
× [
∑
cj∈cluster i
∑

+
∑
cj∈cluster i
∑

′∈Cnew1
wjj′ (1− yjj′ )DISTk].
For the cells in Cnew1 the assigned switches not yet been
determined, the location update cost between these cells can
not be computed by a determinative formula. To estimate the
location update cost, let DISTk =
∑m
l=1Dkl/m be average
distance between switch sk and the other switches in Sold.
Then the location update cost between cells in Cnew1 which is
assigned to new switch sk can be estimated by
Jik = α×
∑
cj∈cluster i
∑
c
j
′∈Cnew1 \cluster i
wjj′ (1−yjj′ )DISTk.
(11)
In this subsection, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to
solve this problem. First, a bipartite graph BG′(CL, SL) is
constructed, let SL be the set of candidate sites of the new
switches {s1, s2, ..., s|SL| = sm′}, CL = {CL1, CL2, ...,
CL|CL| = CLm′′} be the set of clusters in Cnew1 . Then,
for each cluster in CLi (i=1, 2, ..., |CL|), there is one edge
connected cluster to each node in SLk (k=1, 2, ..., |SL|). The
weight of edge which connected cell CLi in CL to SLk ∈ SL,
is set to be
cik = Hik + Iik + Jik. (12)
The resource-cost of edge which connected cluster CLi ∈
CL to SLk ∈ SL, is set to be
rik = setupk + Eik + Fk. (13)
Obviously, this sub-problem can be transformed to the
singly constrained assignment problem (SCAP) [9] [10]. The
SCAP is formulated as:
minimize
|CL|∑
i=1
|SL|∑
k=1
cikzik (14)
subject to
|CL|∑
i=1
zik ≤ 1 i = 1, 2, ..., |CL|; (15)
|SL|∑
k=1
zik = 1 k = 1, 2, ..., |SL|; (16)
zik ∈ {0, 1} i = 1, 2, ..., |CL|, k = 1, 2, ..., |SL|;(17)
|CL|∑
i=1
|SL|∑
k=1
rikzik ≤ BUDGET ′ . (18)
Here the interpretation can be used, that zik = 1 implies
that cluster CLi is assigned to switch SLk at a cost of cik,
that rik is the resource usage (budget usage) when cluster
CLi is assigned to switch SLk and that BUDGET ′ is
the available budget. Equations (16)–(18) are denoted as the
LAP constraints and equation (19) is denoted as the resource
constraint. The SCAP can be regarded as a knapsack problem
(KP) complicated by equations (16) and (17) [10]. As the KP
is NP-complete, the SCAP is at least as hard as NP-complete.
It is thus very unlikely that a fully polynomial algorithm exists
to solve the SCAP.
In this subsection, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to
solve it. First, Hitchcoch Algorithm is applied to find the
minimal weight matching of assignment problem without
taking the consideration of the budget constraint. The result
of this assignment is denoted as initial assignment (IA). Let
cost(IA) and budget(IA) be the cost and the used budget
of the IA, respectively. If budget(IA) < BUDGET ′ then
the assignment is found; otherwise, the IA should be adjusted
so that the budget constraint can be satisfied. To adjust the
assignment, cluster exchange method was proposed to reduce
the used budget. For each pair of clusters CLi and CLj in CL,
assume zik = 1 and zjl = 1, that is, cluster CLi and CLj is
assigned to switch SLk and SLl, respectively. Let CE(i, j) be
the result that exchanges the assignment of cluster CLi and
CLj , and cost(CE(i, j)) and budget(CE(i, j)) be the cost
and the saving budget of the CE(i, j). Find the pair of clusters
CLi and CLj such that the budget(IA)−budget(CE(i, j)) <
BUDGET ′ and with minimal cost(CE(i, j)), if found
then exchange clusters CLi and CLj and done. Other-
wise, let budget(CE(i′, j′) = max∀i,j{budget(CE(i, j))},
if budget(IA) − budget(CE(i′, j′)) > BUDGET ′ then
perform the cluster exchange to get CE(i′, j′), subtract
budget(CE(i′, j′)) from budget(IA), and IA is replaced
by CE(i′, j′). Repeat this process until budget(IA) −
budget(CE(i, j)) < BUDGET ′. The heuristic algorithm is
described as follows.

of cells.
and connection configuration in the form of nonnegative inte-
ger decides the activation or deactivation of the new switch and
the connection of the corresponding new switches. The number
of switches with positive integer in the SLCC is assumed to
be equal to d(|Cnew| −∑mk=1 Capk)/CAP e, that is, base on
the assumption that the cost of setup a new switch is more
expensive than the cost of establishing several backbone links.
The SLCC can also be used to represent the backbone links
between new switches and other (new or old) switches. To
make the design of backbone network simply, the links and
switches selected in SLCC together with the network Gold will
form a base connected backbone network GB . The network
GB can be improved by adding backbone links described in
backbone-augment configuration (BAC) if the budget not yet
been use up. The cell-assignment configuration (CAC) defines
the assigning switches of cells. The new cell can only be
assigned to old switches with unused capacity or the new
switch whose value in SLCC is greater than zero.
The detail information of three types of configurations are
described as follows:
• Switch location and connection configuration (SLCC):
Since there are m′ potential sites for the choice of news
switches, a nonnegative integer encoding method is used
to represent whether the site is selected or not. An integral
array SLCC[m+ 1, ...,m+m′] is used to represent the
choice. If SLCC[k] > 0 (m+ 1 ≤ k ≤ m+m′) then a
new switch is located at potential site sk; SLCC[k] = 0,
otherwise. Moreover, the content of the element in SLCC
is used to represent the connections between switches.
Since the existing ATM network is connected. Thus,
to form a new connected backbone network, the only
thing should be done is to keep the information of how
the new switch is connected to another switches. The
value of SLCC[m+ 1, ...,m+m′] is used to represent
the connections of new switches to another switches. If
SLCC[k] = l(m + 1 ≤ k ≤ m +m′, 1 ≤ l ≤ m +m′)
then there is a backbone link between switches sk and
sl.
• Backbone-augment configuration (BAC): The network
GB formed by Gold and the link described in SLCC can
be improved by adding backbone links to the backbone-
augment configuration (BAC) if the budget not yet been
use up. The implementation of the BAC is a linked list,
which consists of nodes used to represent the link of
backbone link, is used.
• Cell-assignment configuration (CAC): A coding scheme
that uses positive integer numbers is used to represent the
assigning switches of cells. The cell–assignment configu-
ration is shown in Fig. 2(c), where the ith cell belongs to
the CAC[i]-th switch. It should be noticed that, the cell-
assignment configuration can be divided into two sets,
the first set of cells which represents the assignment of
cells in Cold is fixed in running of SA. Thus, the first
set of cells can be ignored since it is unchanged during
experiments.
B. Initial Configuration generation
Since the content of SLCC does effect the contents of
the BAC and CAC. The number of switches to be selected
is equal to d(|Cnew| −∑mk=1 Capk)/CAP e and the switch
is randomly selected. Once the location of new switches
have been selected, the connections of switches should be
updated according to the selection of new switches. To do this,
let switch-pool for connection (SPC) be the set of numbers
indicated switches which will be used to determine SLCC.
Thus SPC = {1, 2...,m} ∪{i | SLCC[i] > 0,m + 1 ≤ i ≤
m + m′}. To generate the connection of new switches, the
value of element of array SLCC is randomly selected from
SPC. This process will guarantee that each new switch will
be connected to an exist switch. Similarly, the assignments of
cells to switches should be updated according to the selection
of new switches. Let switch-pool for assignment (SPA) be
the set of numbers indicated switches which can be used in
choosing of SLCC. For switch sk, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, Capk “k” are
inserted into set SPA. For switch sk, if m+1 ≤ k ≤ m+m′,
if SLCC[k] > 0, CAP “k” are inserted into set SPA. Note
that, the SPC should be updated if the a new switch is selected.
To assign cells to switches, the value of element in array CAC
is randomly selected a number from SPA and removed it from
SPA. After performing the cell assignment, if the budget not
yet been use up the link which connected two switches in SPC
is randomly selected to argument the backbone network.
The objective cost defined in (2) is used as the cost
function. In the proposed SA, only the feasible solution can
be generated, thus there is no need for designing the penalty
function. Only generating feasible solutions can expedite the
converge and improve the performance of the proposed SA.
C. Perturbation mechanism
Simulated annealing algorithm uses perturbation to change
the configuration from one state to another state. After per-
turbation, the resulted configuration still a constraint-satisfied
one after performing perturbation. In the following, several
types of perturbations are introduced into the SA algorithm
for solving the NEP problem.
• P1: Cell exchanging perturbation (CEP): Random se-
lected two cells in Cnew, say ci and cj which assigned to

VI. GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR NETWORK EXPANDED
PROBLEM
In this section, the details of GA developed to solve the
network expanded problem is discussed. The development of
GA requires: (1) a chromosomal coding scheme, (2) initial
population generation, (3) a chromosome adjustment proce-
dure, (4) a genetic crossover operator, (5) mutation operators,
(6) a fitness function definition, (7) a replacement strategy, and
(8) termination rules.
A. Chromosomal coding
To solve this problem, two two-level genes are introduced
as illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4. In these encoding schemes, the
activation of the low-level gene is governed by the value of
the high-level gene. To indicate the activation of the high-level
gene, an integer “1” is assigned for each high-level gene that is
being ignited were “0” is for turning off. When “1” is signaled,
the associated low-level gene due to that particular active
high-level gene is activated in the lower level structure. It
should be noticed that the inactive gene always exist within the
chromosome even when “0” appears. This architecture implies
that chromosome contains more information than that of the
conventional GA structure. Hence, it is called Hierarchical
Genetic Algorithm (HGA) [12].
To solve the network expanded problem in wireless ATM
network, three types of genes, known as switch-location
gene, switch-connection gene, and cell-assignment gene, are
introduced. The switch-location gene in the form of bits
decides the activation or deactivation of the corresponding
new switches. The switch-connection gene defines the link
connections between new switches and other (new or old)
switches. The cell-assignment gene defines the assignment of
cells to switches. For example, in Fig. 3, the switch-connection
s5 and s6, with switch-location gene signified as “0” in the
corresponding sites, are not being activated. Furthermore, the
switch s5 and s6 will not appear in the content of the cell-
assignment gene (as seen in Fig. 4 ). The detail information
of three types of genes are described as follows:
• Switch-location gene (SL): Since there are m′ potential
sites for the choice of news switches, a binary encoding
method is used to represent whether the site is selected
or not. A binary array SL[m + 1, ...,m + m′] is used
to represent the choice. If SL[k] = 1 (m + 1 ≤ k ≤
m+m′) then a new switch is located at potential site sk;
SL[k] = 0, otherwise. For example, assume s8, s9, and
s13 are selected be the new switches, the switch-location
gene of the example shown in Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 5(a).
• Switch-connection genes (SC): A positive integral encod-
ing method is used to describe the connections between
switches. Since the existing ATM network is connected.
Thus, to form a connected backbone network, the only
thing should be done is to keep the information of how
the new switch is connected to another switches. An
integral array SL[m+1, ...,m+m′] is used to represent
the connections of new switches to another switches. If
SC[k] = l(m+ 1 ≤ k ≤ m+m′, 1 ≤ l ≤ m+m′) then
there is a backbone link between switches sk and sl. For
example, assume s8, s9, and s13 are selected to be the
new switches, a possible switch-connection gene of the
example shown in Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 5(b).
• Cell-assignment gene (CA): For the cell assignment
subproblem, a coding scheme that uses positive integer
numbers. The cell–assignment gene is shown in Fig. 5(c),
where the ith cell belongs to the CA[i]-th switch. For ex-
ample, the possible cell-assignment gene of the example
shown in Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 5(c). It should be noticed
that, the cell-assignment gene can be divided into two
sets, the first set of cells which represents the assignment
of cells in Cold is fixed in running of GA. Thus, the first
set of cells can be ignored since it is unchanged during
experiments.
Furthermore, switch-location, switch-connection and cell-
assignment genes are used in Switch Site Selection Phase;
the value of each gene is randomly generated by a random
number in the evolutionary process. In running Switch
Connection Decision Phase, Switch Location genes are
fixed, and the other two genes are treated as variables. In
running Cell Assignment Decision Phase, switch-location
gene and switch-connection gene are fixed, and cell-
assignment gene is treated as a variable.
offspring, first, all characters between i and m +m′ of
two parents are swapped and children C1 and C2 are
generated. Then, the following SL gene and CA gene
are regenerated according to the contents of the C1 and
C2.
• In the Switch Connection Decision Phase, switch-location
gene is fixed. Two switch-connection genes (say SC1
and SC2) are randomly selected for crossover. After
performing crossover operation, the resulting genes may
represent a disconnected network. Thus, the CAP as
illustrated in Section 4.3 should be applied to change the
children SC gene to feasible one. It should be noticed
that the cell-assignment gene does not change.
• In the Cell Assignment Decision Phase, switch-location
gene and switch-connection gene are fixed. Two cell-
assignment genes (say CA1 and CA2) are randomly
selected for crossover. After performing crossover op-
eration, the resulting genes may violate the capacity
constraint, Thus, chromosome adjust procedure proposed
in previous subsection should be applied to change the
CA genes into a feasible one.
E. Mutation
The traditional single cell mutating operation, which mu-
tates a cell in genes at a time, is used to develop of this
algorithm.
• In the Switch Site Selection Phase, the mutating operator
changes a randomly selected cell in switch-location gene
from “0” to “1” or from “1” to “0”. The value of the
mutated cell in the SL is randomly assigned to a switch.
If the resulting backbone network is not connected then
the chromosome adjustment procedure should be applied.
Final, the Cell-assignment gene is regenerated according
to the content of the SL.
• In the Switch Connection Decision Phase, the mutating
operator changes a randomly selected cell in switch-
connection gene from current value to an integer which
is randomly selected from the SPC. If the resulting
backbone network is not a connected network then the
CAP should be applied. It should be noticed that the
switch-location gene and the cell-assignment gene need
not change.
• In the Cell Assignment Decision Phase, switch-location
gene and switch-connection genes are fixed. Four types of
mutations can be applied to CA gene. It is worth noting
that After mutation, the chromosome may became an
infeasible one, thus, the Chromosome Adjustment Proce-
dure must be applied to the chromosome. (1) Traditional
Mutation (TM): randomly select a cell of vector vi, where
i in [n+1, n+n′] and transform to a random number be-
tween 1 to m+m′. (2) Multiple Cells Mutation (MCM):
randomly select two random numbers k, l between 1 and
m+m′, transform the value of cells in Cnew which value
is k to l and l to k. (3) Heaviest Weight First Preference
(HWFP) [4]. Since the handoff cost involving only one
switch is negligible, two cells can be assigned to the same
switch so as to reduce the handoff cost between these
cells. Two cells with higher weight wij should have a
higher probability of being assigned to the same switch.
Thus, if we consider two connected cells ci and cj ∈ C,
then the probability of mutation from vi of cell ci to the
value vj of cell cj is as follows:
P(i,j) =
wij∑n
i=1
∑degree(ci)
j=1 wij
, (20)
where degree(ci) is the number of cells connected to cell
ci in CG.
(4) Minimal Cabling Cost First Preference (MCCFP) [4].
To reduce the cabling costs between cells and switches,
we prefer to assign each cell to the nearer switch rather
than the farther one. Cell ci and switch sk with lower
cabling cost lik should result in higher probability that ci
will be assigned to sk. Thus, if we consider the randomly
selected cell ci, then the probability of mutation from vi
of cell ci to the value vk is :
P(i,k) =
Lmax − lik∑m
l=1(Lmax − lil)
, (21)
where Lmax = maxml=1{lil}.
F. Fitness function definition
Generally, genetic algorithms use fitness functions to
map objectives to costs to achieve the goal of an optimally
designed two-level wireless ATM network. If cell ci is
assigned to switch sk, then vi in the CA genes is set to k. Let
d(vi,vj) be the minimal communication cost between switches
sk and sl in G. An objective function value is associated with
each chromosome, which is the same as the fitness measure.
The following objective function is used to represent the
fitness function:

Budget), 0} is the penalty measure associated with a
chromosome, and assume nk be the number of cells in Cnew
be assigned to switch sk, and β and γ are the penalty weights
(see [14] for a further discussion of penalty measures). Since
the best-fit chromosomes should have a probability of being
selected as parent’s proportional to their fitness, they need
to be expressed in a maximization form. This is done by
subtracting the objective from a large number Cmax. Hence,
the fitness function becomes:

The performance of the proposed simulated annealing algo-
rithm is examined and compared here. Let |Cold|=50, |Cnew|=
50, 100, or 150, |Sold| = 12, the value of CAP is in {5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10}. α = 0.001, the best results of the simulated
annealing algorithm after running 10 times are compared with
the greedy heuristic algorithm HA [8]. The results were shown
in Table. I. It is easy to find that the SA gets better results
then HA.
C. Results of Heuristic Algorithm
To examine the effect of the proposed algorithm, the result
of running genetic algorithm is used. Figure 8 shows the effect
of the different values of BUDGET and α. Observe the results
shown in Fig. 8(a)-(e), the results obtained by performing
SSP can be further improved by performing BDP. The left
portion of Fig. 8(f) shows the relation between reduced ratio
computed by (SSP −BDP )/SSP × 100% and the ratio α.
In average, after performing Backbone Deign Phase (BDP),
the cost can be reduced by 33.05%. The right portion of
Fig. 8(f) shows the relation between reduced ratio computed
by (HA−GA)/GA× 100% and the ratio α. In average, the
result obtained by HA is in 5% of the result of GA.
D. Results of Genetic Algorithm
The effect of the proposed algorithm is examined. Table II
shows the effect of the different value of BUDGET. For the test
example, in average, after performing Backbone Deign Phase
(BDP), the cost can be reduce 33.05%, where the reduce ratio
is computed by (SSP −BDP )/SSP × 100%.
In the follows, first, the parameters (mutation probabil-
ity, crossover probabilities, and population size) of genetic
algorithm are examined. Then the performance of genetic
algorithm is examined and compared.
E. Parameters of GA
In this subsection, the effects of the various parameters of
each genetic algorithm are discussed. The parameters of GA
are: crossover probability Pc=1.0, mutation probability Pm,

Abstract. In this paper, the network expanded problem (NEP) which
optimally assigns new adding and splitting cells in PCS (Personal Com-
munication Service) network to switches in an ATM (Asynchronous
Transfer Mode) network is studied. In NEP, the locations of cells (or Base
Stations, BSs) in PCS network are ﬁxed and known, but new switches
should be installed to ATM network and the topology of the backbone
network may be changed. Given some potential sites of new switches,
the problem is to determine how many switches should be added to the
backbone network, the locations of new switches, the topology of the
new backbone network, and the assignments of new adding and split-
ting cells in the PCS to switches of the new ATM backbone network in
an optimal manner. The goal is to do the expansion in an attempt to
minimize the total communication cost under budget and capacity con-
straints. The NEP is modelled as a complex integer programming prob-
lem. Since ﬁnding an optimal solution to this problem is Impractical. A
simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. In
the proposed SA, several heuristics are encoded into the perturbation to
generate good solutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed
simulated annealing algorithm can get better performance than heuristic
algorithm.
1 Introduction
The rapid worldwide growth of digital wireless communication services motivate
a new generation of mobile switching networks (such as wireless ATM[1]) to serve
as infrastructure for such services. In the architecture which based on wireless
ATM presented in [1], the base stations (BSs or cells) were directly connected to
the ATM switches. In the process of designing PCS (Personal Communication
Service) network, ﬁrst, the telephone company determined the global service
area(GSA) and divided the GSA into several smaller coverage areas. For each
area, a BS was established and connected to a switch of the backbone network to

switch. The budget constraint is used to constrain the sum of following costs:
(1) the sum of the switch setup cost, (2) the backbone link setup cost between
two switches, and (3) the local link setup cost between cells and switches.
In this paper, a more complex problem is considered. Following the objective
function formulated in [3,4,5,6,7], new cells and new switches should be intro-
duced into the two-level network. In this paper, the locations of new switches,
the connections between switches, and the assignments of new and splitting cells
should be determined so that the objective cost can be minimized under budget
and capacity constraints. This problem is denoted as network expanded problem
(NEP) in wireless ATM environment. Obviously, ﬁnding an optimal solution for
it is impractical due to exponential growth in execution time. Simulated an-
nealing (SA) is a stochastic computational technique derived from statistical
mechanics for ﬁnding near globally-minimum-cost solutions to large optimiza-
tion problems. In this paper, a simulated annealing algorithm is developed to
ﬁnd an approximate solution of the NEP problem.
2 Problem Formulation
For the backbone network, assume that: (1) each cell is connected to a switch
through a local link , (2) the switches are interconnected with a speciﬁed topology
through backbone links , (3) the number of cells can be handled by a new switch
cannot exceed CAP , (4) at most one switch can be installed at a given potential
site, (5) all links of the current backbone network are kept in place, (6) a switch
site in the current network is also a switch site in the expanded network, and
(7) the backbone network topologies are preserved in the expanded backbone
network. Moreover, assume the information described below are ﬁxed and known:
(1) the location of the new cells and the handoﬀ frequency between cells, (2) the
potential switch sites, (3) the setup cost of switch at a particular site, (4) the
local link setup cost between cells and switches, and (5) the backbone link setup
cost between switches. The goal is to ﬁnd the minimum-cost expanded network
subject to all of the above assumption, facts and constraints (described later).
Let CG(C,L) be the PCS network, where C is a ﬁnite set of cells and L is
the set of edges such that L ⊆ C ×C. Assume Cnew ∪Cold = C, Cnew ∩Cold=∅,
Cnew be the set of new and splitting cells where |Cnew | = n′, and Cold be the set
of original cells where |Cold | = n. Without loss of generality, cells in Cold and
Cnew are numbered from 1 to n and n + 1 to n + n′, respectively.
If cells ci and cj in C are assigned to diﬀerent switches, then an inter-switch
handoﬀ cost is incurred. Let fij be the frequency of handoﬀ per unit time that
occurs between cells ci and cj . All edges in C are undirected and weighted;
cells ci and cj in C are connected by an edge (ci, cj) ∈ L with weight wij ,
where wij=fij+fji, wij = wji, and wii = 0[4,5]. Let Gold(Sold, Eold) be the
currently exist ATM network, where Sold is the set of switches with |Sold| = m,
Eold ⊆ Sold × Sold is the set of edges, sk, sl in Sold, (sk, sl) in Eold, and Gold is
connected. The topology of the ATM network Gold(Sold, Eold) will be expanded
to G(S,E). Let Snew be the set of potential sites of switches. Without loss of

3 Simulated Annealing Algorithm for NEP
3.1 Conﬁguration Space
The object of NEP problem is to ﬁnd the location of the new switch, the topol-
ogy of backbone network, and the assigning switch of cell, so that the objective
function is minimized under the capacity and budget constraints. To do this, the
conﬁguration space is designed to be the set of possible solutions. To solve the
network expanded problem in wireless ATM network, three types of conﬁgura-
tions, known as switch location and connection conﬁguration (SLCC), backbone-
augment conﬁguration (BAC), and cell-assignment conﬁguration (CAC) are in-
troduced and illustrated in Fig. 2(a). The switch location and connection conﬁg-
uration in the form of nonnegative integer decides the activation or deactivation
of the new switch and the connection of the corresponding new switches. The
number of switches with positive integer in the SLCC is assumed to be equal to
(|Cnew | − ∑mk=1 Capk)/CAP 	, that is, base on the assumption that the cost
of setup a new switch is more expensive than the cost of establishing several
backbone links. The SLCC can also be used to represent the backbone links
between new switches and other (new or old) switches. To make the design of
backbone network simply, the links and switches selected in SLCC together with
1144 D.-R. Din
used in choosing of SLCC. For switch sk, 1 ≤ k ≤ m, Capk “k” are inserted
into set SPA. For switch sk, if m + 1 ≤ k ≤ m + m′, if SLCC[k] > 0, CAP
“k” are inserted into set SPA. Note that, the SPC should be updated if the a
new switch is selected. To assign cells to switches, the value of element in array
CAC is randomly selected a number from SPA and removed it from SPA. After
performing the cell assignment, if the budget not yet been use up the link which
connected two switches in SPC is randomly selected to argument the backbone
network.
The objective cost deﬁned in (2) is used as the cost function. In the proposed
SA, only the feasible solution can be generated, thus there is no need for de-
signing the penalty function. Only generating feasible solutions can expedite the
converge and improve the performance of the proposed SA.
3.3 Perturbation Mechanism
Simulated annealing algorithm uses perturbation to change the conﬁguration
from one state to another state. After perturbation, the resulted conﬁguration
still a constraint-satisﬁed one after performing perturbation. In the following,
several types of perturbations are introduced into the SA algorithm for solving
the NEP problem.
(1) P1: Cell exchanging perturbation (CEP): Random selected two cells in
Cnew, say ci and cj which assigned to switch sk and sl, respectively. The assign-
ment of these cells are exchanged, that is, ci assigned to sl and cj assigned to sk.
(2) P2: Switch exchange perturbation (SEP): Random selected two switches sk
and sl in Snew, all cells assigned to these switches are exchanged. (3) P3: Switch
migrating perturbation (SMP): The perturbation randomly selected switch sk in
SLCC with positive value and change it to 0 and another switch sl (k 
= l) from
“0” to the original value of SLCC[k]. All cells assigned to switch sk are reas-
signed to sl, all backbone links which connected to sk should be deleted and new
backbone links connected to sl should be established. (4) P4: Backbone link per-
turbation (BLP): Randomly selected a backbone link in current backbone remove
it and random selected a new backbone link to added.
Let pi be the probability of transforming current conﬁguration to a new one by
applying the perturbation Pi, i=1, 2, ..., 4, respectively. Assume that Σ4i=1pi = 1.
Let AP0 = 0 and APi = Σij=1pj be the accumulated probability of pi, i=1,
2, ..., 4.
3.4 Cooling Schedule

Abstract. In this paper, the network expanded problem (NEP) which
optimally assigns new adding and splitting cells in PCS (Personal Com-
munication Service) network to switches in an ATM (Asynchronous
Transfer Mode) network is studied. In NEP, the locations of all cells
(or Base Station, BS) in PCS network are ﬁxed and known, but new
switches should be installed to ATM network and the topology of the
backbone network may be changed. Given some potential sites of new
switches, the problem is to determine how many switches should be added
to the backbone network, the locations of new switches, the topology of
the new backbone network, and the assignments of new adding and split-
ting cells in the PCS to switches on the new ATM backbone network in
an optimum manner. The goal is to do the expansion in as attempt to
minimize the total communication cost under budget and capacity con-
straints. The NEP is modeled as a complex integer programming problem
and ﬁnding an optimal solution to this problem is NP-hard . A heuristic
algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed heuristic algo-
rithm consists of four phases: Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase
(RCPP), Cell Clustering Phase (CCP), Switch Selection Phase (SSP),
and Backbone Design Phase (BDP). Experimental results indicate that
the proposed algorithm can ﬁnd good solution.
Keywords: Heuristic algorithm, wireless ATM, network expanded prob-
lem, cell assignment problem, cell splitting.
1 Introduction
The rapid worldwide growth of digital wireless communication services motivate
a new generation of mobile switching networks (such as wireless ATM[1]) to serve
as infrastructure for such services. In the architecture which based on wireless
ATM presented in [1], the base stations (BSs or cells) were directly connected to
the ATM switches. In the process of designing PCS (Personal Communication
Service) network, ﬁrst, the telephone company determined the global service

(NEP) in wireless ATM environment. Obviously, ﬁnding an optimal solution for
it is impractical due to exponential growth in execution time. In this paper, a
heuristic algorithm is developed to ﬁnd a near-optimal solution.
The organization of this paper is shown as follows. In Section 2, the problem
formulation is deﬁned. In Sections 3 and 4, the outline and details of the pro-
posed heuristic algorithm are described. The experimental results are presented
in Section 5. Final, a conclusion is given in Section 6.
2 Problem Formulation
For the backbone network, assume that: (1) each cell is connected to a switch
through a local link , (2) the switches are interconnected with a speciﬁed topology
through backbone links , (3) the number of cells can be handled by a new switch
cannot exceed CAP , (4) at most one switch can be installed at a given potential
site, (5) all links of the current backbone network are kept in place, (6) a switch
site in the current network is also a switch site in the expanded network, and
(7) the backbone network topologies are preserved in the expanded backbone
network. Moreover, assume the information described below are ﬁxed and known:
(1) the location of the new cells and the handoﬀ frequency between cells, (2) the
potential switch sites, (3) the setup cost of switch at a particular site, (4) the
local link setup cost between cells and switches, and (5) the backbone link setup
cost between switches. The goal is to ﬁnd the minimum-cost expanded network
subject to all of the above assumption, facts and constraints (described later).
Let CG(C,L) be the PCS network, where C is a ﬁnite set of cells and L is
the set of edges such that L ⊆ C ×C. Assume Cnew ∪Cold = C, Cnew ∩Cold=∅,
Cnew be the set of new and splitting cells where |Cnew | = n′, and Cold be the set
of original cells where |Cold | = n. Without loss of generality, cells in Cold and
Cnew are numbered from 1 to n and n + 1 to n + n′, respectively.
If cells ci and cj in C are assigned to diﬀerent switches, then an inter-switch
handoﬀ cost is incurred. Let wij be the frequency of handoﬀ per unit time that
occurs between cells ci and cj , wij = wji, and wii = 0[4,5]. Let Gold(Sold, Eold)
be the currently exist ATM network, where Sold is the set of switches with
|Sold| = m, Eold ⊆ Sold × Sold is the set of edges, and Gold is connected. The
topology of the ATM network Gold(Sold, Eold) will be expanded to G(S,E). Let
Snew be the set of potential sites of switches. Without loss of generality, switches
in Sold and Snew are indexed from 1 to m and m + 1 to m + m′, respectively.
The total communication cost has two components, the ﬁrst is the cabling
cost between cells and switches, and the other is the handoﬀ cost which occurred
between two switches. Let lik be the cabling cost per unit time between cell ci
switch sk. Assume the number of calls that can be handled by each cell per unit
time is equal to 1 and CAP denotes the cell handling capacity of each new switch
sk ∈ Snew, (k = m+1, m+2, ..., m+m′). Let CAPk be the number of remaining
capacities that can be used to assign cells to switch sk ∈ Sold,(k=1, 2, ..., m).
Let qk =1, (k = 1, 2, ..., m + m′) if there is a switch installed on site sk; qk=0,
otherwise (as known, qk =1, for k= 1, 2, ..., m). Let setupk be the setup cost of

3 Outline of Solution Algorithm
In general, the network expanded problem is a multi-constraints optimization
problem; in fact, it is an NP-hard problem. That is, for the practical problem
with a modest number of nodes, only approximate solutions can be obtained
through heuristic algorithms. In this paper, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to
solve this problem. The proposed heuristic algorithm consists of four phases, they
are Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP), Cell Clustering Phase
(CCP), Switch Selection Phase (SSP), and Backbone Design Phase (BDP).
– Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP): In the Remaining Ca-
pacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP), the remaining capacities of the old
switches are used to assign cells so as to reduce the cost for setting new
switches. Some cells in Cnew are assigned to old switches with sparse capac-
ities.
– Cell Clustering Phase (CCP): In the Cell Clustering Phase (CCP), new cells
in Cnew not yet been assigned in RCCP are grouped into clusters according
to some grouping criterions so as to reduce the location update cost between
cells.
– Switch Selection Phase (SSP): In the Switch Selection Phase, for each cluster
obtained by performing CCP, a new switch is to be established and provided
services to cells in the same cluster. The locations of the new switches are
formed the given candidate sites. Moreover, new cells in the cluster are con-
nected to the corresponding new switch. The link between new switch and
the nearest switch in Sold is connected. After performing this phase, each
cell is assigned to a switch and a constraint-satisﬁed (or feasible) solution is
found.
– Backbone Design Phase (BDP): In the Backbone Design Phase, the feasible
solution obtained by performing previous phases will be improved. In this
phase, new switches may be re-connected to old switches or new switches.
Moreover, cell-exchange and backbone link appending techniques are pro-
posed and used to reduce the objective cost under budget constraint.
4 Heuristic Algorithm for NEP
4.1 Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase(RCPP)
In the Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP), the remaining ca-
pacities of old switches are used to assign new cells so as to reduce the cost for
setting new switches. Some cells in Cnew are assigned to switches in Cold. To
determine the cell assignment, the proposed algorithm is described as follows:
First, some notations used in the following subsections are introduced. Given
m sets of cells Pl, l=1, 2, ..., m, assume P1∪P2∪ ...∪Pm = Cold and Pi∩Pj = φ,
where i = j, i, j=1, 2, ..., m. Without loss of generality, assume that cells in
set Pj are assigned to the switch sj , j=1, 2, ..., m. Let sid(ci) = l if ci is in
Pl, l is called the sid of cell ci. Let LUCS(i, l) =
∑
cj∈Pl wij be the sum of the
852 D.-R. Din
constructed, let Scap = { s11, s12, ..., s1cap1 , s21, s22, ..., s2cap2 , ..., sk1, sk2, ...,
skcapk , ..., sm1, sm2, ..., smcapm}, i.e., for each switch sk in Sold, CAPk nodes,
sk1, sk2, ..., skcapk , are constructed. C
new be the set of cells have not yet been
assigned to switches. Then, for each cell in Cnew , there is one edge connected
cell to each node in Scap. The weight of edge which connected cell ci in Cnew to
skp ∈Scap, p=1, 2, ..., CAPk is set to be
lik + Aik + Bik. (10)
Obviously, the sub-problem can be formulated as a minimal weighted match-
ing problem on bipartite graph, which is known as the assignment problem [8].
Therefore, Hitchcoch Algorithm[8] can be applied to ﬁnd the optimal solution
of assignment problem in O(max{|Cnew|, |Scap|}3)=O(max{n′ ,∑mk=1 CAPk}3).
After determining the set of cells in Cnew that is to be assigned to the switch in
Sold, the link setup cost the set of cells should be computed and the remaining
budget (BUDGET ′) should be found.
4.2 Cell Clustering Phase(CCP)
After performing the Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase, some assign-
ments of cells in Cnew are determined. Thus, remove these cells from Cnew will
form a set of cells named Cnew1 ⊆ Cnew . In the Cell Clustering Phase (CCP),
cells in Cnew1 are grouped into clusters so as to reduce the handoﬀ cost between
cells. To obtain better clustering result, some threshold values should be used to
constrain the clustering process. These thresholds are:
– Capacity (CAP ): This is used to avoid generating extremely large clusters.
– Average location update cost (ALUC): Deﬁne ALUC =
∑|Cnew1 |
i=1
∑|Cnew1 |
j=1
(wij/(|Cnew1 |2 − |Cnew1 |)), this is used to avoid merging very low-cost edges.
– Average cell to cell distance (ACD): Let dist(ci, cj) be the distance between
cell ci and cj , and ACD =
∑|Cnew1 |
i=1
∑|Cnew1 |
j=1 dist(ci, cj) /(|Cnew1 |2 −|Cnew1 |),
this is used to avoid merging distant cells.
Let W (Clusteri) be the number of cells in cluster Clusteri with initial value
1 (initially, each cell is viewed as a cluster), and let dist(ci, cj) be the Euclidean
distance of two cells ci and cj in Cnew1 . To decide whether or not two cells
can be merged, three merging constraints are deﬁned. If Clusteri and Clusterj
are merged, the following constraints must be satisﬁed: (1) W (Clusteri) +
W (Clusterj) ≤ CAP . (2) wij > ALUC. (3) dist(ci, cj) < ACD.
To satisfy the capacity constraint, the Cluster Packing step proposed in [5] can
be use to merge some small cells (clusters) left into the cell graph to larger cells in
order to reduce the number of clusters to m
′′
= 	(|Cnew |−∑mk=1 CAPk)/CAP 

= 	|Cnew1 |/CAP 
. Note that, this value is the number of new switches should
be established.

In this subsection, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve this problem.
First, a bipartite graph BG′(CL, SL) is constructed, let SL be the set of candi-
date sites of the new switches {s1, s2, ..., s|SL| = sm′ }, CL = {CL1, CL2, ...,
CL|CL| = CLm′′ } be the set of clusters in Cnew1 . Then, for each cluster in CLi
(i=1, 2, ..., |CL|), there is one edge connected cluster to each node in SLk (k=1,
2, ..., |SL|). The weight of edge which connected cell CLi in CL to SLk ∈ SL,
is set to be
cik = Hik + Iik + Jik. (13)
The resource-cost of edge which connected cluster CLi ∈ CL to SLk ∈ SL,
is set to be
rik = setupk + Eik + Fk. (14)
Obviously, this sub-problem can be transformed to the singly constrained as-
signment problem (SCAP) [9][10]. The SCAP is formulated as:
minimize
|CL|∑
i=1
|SL|∑
k=1
cikzik (15)
subject to
|CL|∑
i=1
zik ≤ 1 i = 1, 2, ..., |CL|; (16)
|SL|∑
k=1
zik = 1 k = 1, 2, ..., |SL|; (17)
zik ∈ {0, 1} i = 1, 2, ..., |CL|, k = 1, 2, ..., |SL|; (18)
|CL|∑
i=1
|SL|∑
k=1
rikzik ≤ BUDGET ′ . (19)
Here the interpretation can be used, that zik = 1 implies that cluster CLi is
assigned to switch SLk at a cost of cik, that rik is the resource usage (budget
usage) when cluster CLi is assigned to switch SLk and that BUDGET ′ is the
available budget. Equations (16)–(18) are denoted as the LAP constraints and
equation (19) is denoted as the resource constraint . The SCAP can be regarded
as a knapsack problem (KP) complicated by equations (16) and (17) [10]. As the
KP is NP-complete, the SCAP is at least as hard as NP-complete. It is thus very
unlikely that a fully polynomial algorithm exists to solve the SCAP.
In this subsection, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve it. First, Hitch-
coch Algorithm is applied to ﬁnd the minimal weight matching of assignment
problem without taking the consideration of the budget constraint. The re-
sult of this assignment is denoted as initial assignment (IA). Let cost(IA)

new switch(es) (indirectly). Two steps are performed as follows. First, the exist
backbone network is expanded and connected to the near switch to form a new
backbone. Then, iteratively, the new backbone network is repeatedly expanded
to cover all the new switches.
Cell Exchanging Method. In [5], cell exchange method has been proposed
to reduce to total communication cost of the cell assignment problem. The idea
can be modiﬁed and applied to ﬁnd the cell exchanging between two cells in
Cnew under budget constraint. Cell exchanging method tries to select two cells
in Cnew which are assigned to diﬀerent switches and exchanges them such that
the total communication cost can be reduced under budget constraint. Cell-
exchange method exchanges cells assigned to diﬀerent switches by selecting the
“most preferable” cells to exchange instead of exchanging two arbitrary cells.
Given an initial assignment, the total cost can be reduced by reassigning a cell
in current switch to another switch, or exchanging two cells which be assigned
to diﬀerent switches. A set DM of
∑m
k=1 CAPk +
∑m′′
k=1 CAP − |Cnew| dummy
cells are introduced into the CG to ensure that the reassignment of one cell
in one step is possible. Cell exchanging method consecutively selects two cells
in Cnew
⋃
DM which being assigned to diﬀerent switches to exchange. At each
iteration, two cells ca and cb ∈ Cnew
⋃
DM are selected which maximize the
reduced exchanging cost exchange(a, b) where
exchange(a, b) = max
(ci,cj)∈{Cnew
⋃
DM}×{Cnew ⋃ DM}
{exchange(i, j)}. (20)
The iteration continues if exchange(a, b) ≥ 0. The details of the algorithm is
described as follows:
Algorithm: Cell Exchanging
Step 1: For each cell in CG
⋃
DM and each switch in G, compute values of
matrices LUCS(i, l).
Step 2: Find two cells ca and cb in Cnew
⋃
DM assigned to diﬀerent switches
with maximal positive reduce cost and satisfy the budget constraint
(RD = (uik − uil + ujl − ujk) < BUDGET ′), that is,
exchange(a, b)=max(ci,cj)∈{Cnew
⋃
DM}×{Cnew ⋃ DM}{exchange(i, j)}.
Step 3: Update LUCS(i, l), for each ci ∈ Cnew
⋃
DM and sl in L. Subtract
RD from BUDGET
′
.
Step 4: If (Cnew
⋃
DM = ∅) and (BUDGET ′ > 0) go to Step 2.
Step 5: If (exchange(ca, cb) > 0) and (BUDGET
′
> 0) then go to Step 1;
otherwise terminate the algorithm.
Backbone Link Appending Method. In the Backbone Link Appending
Method, the remaining budget is repeatedly used to improve the backbone con-
nectivity and also to decrease the distance(or communication cost) between dis-
tant switches if possible. Let w(sk, sl) be the objective cost (computed by equa-
tion (2)) after adding link (sk, sl) to the backbone network. The details of the
algorithm is described as follows:

6 Conclusions
In this paper, the network expanded problem (NEP) which optimally assigns new
and splitting cells in PCS network to switches on an ATM network is investi-
gated. This problem is currently faced by designers of mobile communication
service and in the future, it is likely to be faced by designers of personal commu-
nication service (PCS). Since ﬁnding an optimal solution of the NEP is NP-hard,
a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve it. The proposed method consists four
phases, they are Remaining Capacities Pre-assigning Phase (RCPP), Cell Clus-
tering Phase (CCP), Switch Selection Phase (SSP), and Backbone Design Phase
