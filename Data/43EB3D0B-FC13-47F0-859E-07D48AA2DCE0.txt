which are concerned about the environmental protection. As researchers in environmental and
medical sciences proposed the relationship of indoor air and volatile organic chemicals
(VOCs), World Health Organization (WHO) and many advanced countries all took notice of
their effect on human health, especially VOCs diffused from fixing up a building, and
established the concentration limit for human health and environmental monitoring.
Formaldehyde (HCHO) was one of the VOCs seriously endangering human health and was
verified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). As science and
technology developed, the techniques for VOCs monitoring were generally applied on
environmental monitoring and labor safety maintenance. Nevertheless, the sample should be
delivered to the bench-top instrument for concentration analysis, like gas chromatography
(G.C.). A “real-time”analyzing is infeasible. Site workers always stayed in an environment
containing over-limit VOCs and were not conscious of the danger. Therefore, many indefinite
cancers were led.
Based on the results of the last project (Control System for Health Diagnosis of Indoor
Environmental–Micro VOC Sensor and Its Application on Health and Energy Saving. Part I.),
the following project will present a control system for health diagnosis of indoor
environmental system. The developed portable VOCs –Formaldehyde sensor will be
connected with a indoor ventilation system for ventilation control. The indoor air containing
over-limit VOCs will be ventilated. Thus, its influence on the human health and energy saving
can be estimated and applied.
Keywords: healthy building, VOCs, formaldehyde, MEMS, micro sensors
particular chemical [3, 4]. It has been shown that throat and
nasal irritation can occur at formaldehyde levels as low as
0.08 ppm [5]. Accordingly, the NIOSH (National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health, USA) has established a
permissible long-term exposure limit of 1 ppm [6].
Historically, the detection of formaldehyde has
generally been achieved using a stringent semi-batch
air-sampling procedure, followed by a batch analysis of the
sample (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, GC/MS).
Clearly, this procedure is unable to provide formaldehyde
exposure information on a real-time basis. Hence, a number
of researchers have developed optical sensors for
formaldehyde quantification applications [7-10]. However,
the associated optical arrangements tend to be rather bulky
and elaborate. Over the past decade, emerging MEMS
technologies and micromachining techniques have
contributed significantly to the miniaturization of sensors. As
a result of advances in MEMS technology, sensing
instrumentation is now available capable of accessing
information at a micro-scale level [11-13]. Importantly, the
sensitivity and performance of these micro sensors can be
enhanced through their integration with
submicron/nano-scale materials and with other micro devices.
Recently, Dirksen et al. [6] fabricated NiO thin-film
formaldehyde gas sensors by dipping alumina substrates in a
nickel acetylacetonate solution to form thin NiO films of
thickness 0.5 μm. It was found that the conductivity of these
films changed as the formaldehyde concentration was varied
at temperatures ranging from 400-600oC. At approximately 3
μm, the sintered grain size was rather large and was hence 
expected to reduce the sensitivity of the device. However, a
linear formaldehyde sensitivity of 0.825 mV ppm-1 was
attained at a temperature of 600oC. Although the sensor
demonstrated a high sensitivity, its detection limit was only
50 ppm, i.e. far higher than the prescribed “maximum
permissible long-term exposure” limit of 1 ppm. Furthermore, 
the proposed sensor lacked an integrated heating device
capable of maintaining the optimal working temperature of
600oC. Therefore, the sensor operation required the use of an
external heater, which not only increased the bulk of the
sensor arrangement, but also increased its power
consumption. As a means of overcoming this problem, Lee et
al. [14] proposed the use of Pt resistors as integrated
micro-heaters for MEMS-based temperature control systems.
Pt was chosen specifically as the resistor material on account
of its physical and chemical stability.
The present study develops a novel simplified process for
fabrication of a MEMS-based formaldehyde sensing device
featuring micro-hotplates with integrated Pt resistance heaters,
a sputtered NiO layer with sub-micrometer grain sizes, and Pt
interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). The experimental results
indicate that the proposed sensor has a high degree of
sensitivity (0.33 Ωppm-1), a low hysteresis value (0.7 ppm),
a detection capability of less than 0.8 ppm, a rapid response
time (13.2 sec), a quick recovery time (40.0 sec), a high
selectivity over a wide formaldehyde concentration range in
the presence of interfering species such as acetone, ethanol
and methanol, and a simple configuration with no
requirement for any form of external heating device.
II. SENSOR DESIGN
A. Catalysis
A catalyst is an agent which accelerates reactions which
are thermodynamically favored but kinetically slow. Metal
clusters and oxides are both suitable catalysts for oxidation
reactions. In the current investigation involving the oxidation
of formaldehyde, two particular oxidation reactions are of
interest, namely:
HCHO(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → HCOOH(g)
In this study, the NiO films were prepared using an RF
magnetron sputtering system with a NiO target of 99.98%
purity [18]. The oxide was sputtered on Si3N4/Si substrates,
which were placed at a distance of 11.4 cm from the NiO
target. Sputtering was performed under a gas pressure of 0.01
torr with the target maintained at a constant RF power of 200
W. The reactive sputter gas was a mixture of argon (50%) and
pure oxygen gas (50%). The substrate temperature during
sputtering was varied between 350 and 450oC [19]. Prior to
deposition, the chamber was pumped to a background
pressure of 10-6 torr for 1 h and a pre-sputtering process was
performed for 10 min to clean the target surface by removing
any possible traces of contamination. To control the thin film
thickness, the deposition time was 10 and 8 h for forming
different NiO thicknesses. The deposited NiO films were all
found to have thicknesses of approximately 0.5 and 0.4 μm,
respectively. The phase of the deposited films was studied
using X-ray diffraction (XRD), as described in Section 4.1.
B .Microfabrication
The present gas detectors were fabricated using Si3N4/Si
substrates. Figure 2 presents a schematic illustration of the
fabrication process. Initially, a 1.0 m low-stress silicon
nitride layer was deposited on either side of a
double-side-polished silicon wafer (Fig. 2(a)). A NiO sensing
layer was sputter deposited on the substrate (Fig. 2(b)). A thin
layer of Cr (0.02m) was then deposited as an adhesion layer
for the subsequent electro-beam evaporation of a Pt layer of
0.2m thickness. A standard lift-off process was employed to
pattern the Pt layer to form a micro heater and the IDEs on
the NiO sensing layer (Fig. 2(c)). The resistance of the heater
was designed to be 30 Ω. Electron-beam evaporation and
lift-off procedures were then repeated to deposit and shape
Au (0.4m) electrical leads (Fig. 2(d)). To form the
micro-hotplate structure, a suspended structure and a
back-etching nitride mask were patterned in SF6 RIE plasma
(Fig. 2(e)). Finally, a freestanding structure was released in a
KOH etchant (40 wt %, 85 oC, J. T. Baker, U.S.A.) (Fig. 2(f)).
Following the etching process, the suspended structure was
left supported by a silicon nitride layer of thickness 1 m
[20].
Figure 3 presents an SEM photo of the formaldehyde gas
sensor with the integrated micro-hotplate. Meanwhile, Fig. 4
provides an SEM photo showing the grains of the sputtered
NiO thin film. The grain size is measured to be less than 500
nm. In other words, sub-micrometer grain sizes are formed
under the sputtering process conditions adopted in this study
(Section 3.1.). The highly refined grain size of the sensing
layer is instrumental in enhancing the characteristics of the
proposed sensor, as described in the paragraphs below
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A systematic investigation of the NiO thin film with 0.5
m thickness and the performance of the fabricated
micro-hotplate and formaldehyde gas sensor were conducted.
The diffraction patterns of the deposited NiO thin film were
observed using an XRD measurement system (XRD-600
LabX, Shimadzu, Japan) and the heating performance of the
micro-hotplate was investigated using an IR thermometer
(PT-3LF, OPTEX, Japan). The sensors were characterized in
a test chamber using an LCR meter (LCR-819, Good Will,
Taiwan) connected to the formaldehyde gas sensor to record
the signal response generated by changes in the formaldehyde
concentration over the range 0.8 ppm to 12 ppm.
A. Effects of substrate temperature on the NiO films
Figure 5 shows the diffraction patterns of samples
prepared at substrate temperatures of 350oC, 400oC and
450oC. In the 2θ range under current investigation, a (200)
diffraction peak was observed. However, diffraction peaks
corresponding to Ni, NiOOH, Ni2O3, and Ni(OH)2 were not
evident at any substrate temperature. It is important to grow
NiO films with a preferred crystallographic orientation when
300oC, -0.13 Ωppm-1 at 250oC, -0.12 Ωppm-1 at 200oC and
-0.10Ωppm-1 at 150oC, respectively. The minimum detection
limit of the proposed sensor is determined to be 0.9 ppm at
300oC, 1.6 ppm at 250oC, 2.1 ppm at 200oC and 2.5 ppm at
150oC. Note that these detection limits are significantly lower
than those reported for similar MEMS-based devices
presented in previous studies.
To enhance the sensitivity of the gas sensor, a thinner NiO
thin film of 0.4 m was also fabricated and tested under the
same conditions. In Fig. 10(b), the slopes of the plotted lines
represent the sensitivity and are found to be -0.33Ωppm-1 at
300oC, -0.29 Ωppm-1 at 250oC, -0.24 Ωppm-1 at 200oC and
-0.17Ωppm-1 at 150oC, respectively. The minimum detection
limit of the proposed sensor is determined to be 0.8 ppm at
300oC, 0.85 ppm at 250oC, 0.9 ppm at 200oC and 1.0 ppm at
150oC. The thin NiO thin film (0.4 m) performs better than
the thick NiO thin film with 0.5 m thickness for the
enhancement of the gas sensitivity and the minimum
detection limit.
G. Thermal effect on formaldehyde concentration sensitivity
and lowest detection limit
Figure 11 presents the relationship between the
concentration sensitivity of the gas sensor and the working
temperature for the NiO thin films of two different
thicknesses. It can be seen that the sensitivity of the sensor
increases linearly as the working temperature increases.
Figure 11 also shows the relationship between the lowest
detection limit of the gas sensor and the working temperature.
It is observed that the detection limit of the sensor decreases
linearly with increasing the working temperature. The linear
thermal effect on these two characteristics of the
formaldehyde gas sensor provides a convenient means of
predicting the sensor performance under different working
temperatures and formaldehyde concentrations.
H. Gas selectivity
A previous study has shown that NiO thin-film sensors
are sensitive to various organic vapors, e.g. acetone, ethanol
and methanol, etc. [6]. The experimental results obtained for
the sensitivity of the current gas sensor to acetone, ethanol
and methanol are shown in Figs. 12-14, respectively. It can be
seen that the sensitivity of the sensor to these three organic
vapors increases linearly as the working temperature
increases. Specifically, as the temperature increases from
180oC to 300oC, the device sensitivity increases from -0.0060
to -0.0086Ωppm-1 in acetone vapor, from -0.0030 to -0.0053
Ω ppm-1 in ethanol vapor, and from -0.0023 to 0.0050 Ω
ppm-1 in methanol vapor. The sensitivity of the NiO thin-film
sensor to these organic vapors may potentially affect its
selectivity performance. However, although the sensitivity to
these organic vapors increases as the working temperature
increases, the measured sensitivity is nevertheless far lower
than the experimental results obtained for the formaldehyde
concentration sensitivity. In other words, the formaldehyde
gas sensor developed in this study has a high selectivity in the
presence of acetone, ethanol and methanol, which are the
most commonly used organic chemicals.
V. CONCLUSIONS
This study has successfully demonstrated a novel
self-heating formaldehyde gas sensor based on a thin NiO
sensing layer. A new fabrication process has been developed
in which the NiO thin film is deposited on a suspended
microstructure and Pt metal resistors are then deposited
directly on the sensing layer to serve as micro-heaters. The
integrated micro-hotplate simplifies the experimental set-up
and provides the advantages of a good temperature control
and low power consumption. Pt IDEs are formed on the
sensing layer to measure the conductivity changes caused by
formaldehyde oxidation on the oxide surface. The proposed
MEMS-based sensor demonstrates a high stability, a low
hysteresis value and a rapid response time. Furthermore, the
refined grain size of the oxide sensing layer significantly
increases the sensitivity of the gas sensor (0.33 Ω ppm-1),
