carried out to compare the degradation efficiency of
DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) from
distinct compositions. We also attempted to elucidate the
influences of UV/H2O2 on THMFP, HAAFP and
NDMAFP by varying the carbon and nitrogen contents in
synthetic raw water.
Material and Methods
An eight liter stainless steel UV reactor was used
for photolysis experiments in this study. The UV/H2O2
photooxidation was performed with employment of a
450-watt high pressure mercury ultraviolet lamp
(Hanovia, Ace Glass co., Vineland, NJ), with addition of
3.26 mM (0.01%) hydrogen peroxide in the solutions
(Wang et al., 2001). The water of the eco-pond in
National Taiwan University campus (Taipei, Taiwan) and
treated effluent from Neihu Wastewater Treatment Plant
(NWTP, Taipei, Taiwan) were selected to prepare
solutions with organic carbon and nitrogen constitution
for experiments. Treated domestic wastewater effluent
was served as organic matters of complex structure from
human origins. Histamine dihydrochloride (C5H9N3．
2HCl) and commercial humic acid extract (Aldrich) were
spiked in the solutions to represent simple structure
DOM compounds and natural organic materials,
respectively. Standard DBPFP tests were performed for
THM and HAA formation potentials. The formation
potential of NDMA was conducted as described by
Mitch et al. (2003). The reaction condition and
temperature for NDMAFP was the same as those for
THMFP and HAAFP. Excess ascorbic acid was added to
terminate the reactions.
DON concentration was obtained by substrate total
dissolved nitrogen (TDN) with inorganic nitrogen
concentrations, as in following equation:
[DON] = [TDN] - [NO3
--N] - [NO2
--N] - [NH4
+-N]
Nitrate and nitrite concentration were measured by
a Dionex DX-120 ion chromatography (Sunnyvale, CA,
USA) with IonPac AS4A-SC column. Ammonium
concentration was measured by indophenol blue method
with Merck Specreoquant test kit (analogous Standard
Method 4500-NH3 D). TDN was determined by Koroleff
digestion method with 2,6-dimethylphenol as indicator.
The four THMs were analyzed following EPA
method 524.2 with GC/MS (Agilent 6890GC/5970MSD),
and the nine HAAs were analyzed with EPA method
552.3 by GC (Agilent 6890GC) with micro-ECD.
Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was employed for
analysis of NDMA via headspace extraction from waters.
Concentration of NDMA was determined by a Varian
4000 GC/MS system, CP-3800 GC coupled with 4000
ion trap spectrometer (Varian INC., USA).
Results and Discussions
NPDOC Removal
The UV photolysis tests showed that UV/H2O2
treatment can remove 30-40% of NPDOC in HA/AA
solutions (Figure 1). The oxidation tests with histamine
spiked solutions showed that no apparent difference on
the NPDOC removal profile was observed between the
solutions with different histamine concentrations. The
difference in organic precursors did not affect the overall
NPDOC oxidation efficiency since the contributions of
spiked histamine dihydrochloride to the solutions’DOC
were minor.
For comparison, treated wastewater effluent was
spiked into the eco-pond water as a complex DON
contributor and to represent human originated organic
compounds. Two sets of wastewater were used in the
experiments: the entire volume of effluent (WW) or the
upper layer of settled effluent (WW/U). The results
indicated that WW/U spiked solutions degraded faster in
the first 30 minutes of photooxidation and the NPDOC
profile directly went downward through out the entire
reaction period. The particulate sludge has sizes greater
than 0.45 μm, which can’t be measured with NPDOC 
analysis. As the photolysis reaction proceeds, the sludge
molecules were broken down to intermediates with
smaller size and appeared in the NPDOC measurements.
DON Removal
The trends of HA/AA DON residual in Figure 2a
showed that solutions spiked with histamine
dihydrochloride degraded faster during the UV
photolysis. Figure 2b showed the influence of sludge in
UV photolysis. Since the upper layer of wastewater
contained less macro-molecule substances, the oxidation
of organic matters in the WW/U solutions were more
efficient and resulted in a rapid DON increase in the first
20 minutes. It has been shown that approximately 0.6 to
13% of dissolved organic matters were existed as
combined amino acid in wastewater, and about 14 to
25% was protein (Dignac et al., 2000). These substances
can be breakdown by hydroxyl radicals and result in a
decline of DON gradually, but the process can be
obstructing by turbidity in the solution. When sludge was
added in the solution, as shown in the WW solutions in
Figure 2b, the DON concentrations remained unchanged
during the photolysis. In brief, the existence of sludge
particles requires much longer reaction time or higher
dose of hydroxyl radicals to completely mineralize the
nitrogen contained substances in wastewater. It has been
shown that complete decomposition of sludges can be
achieved with enough contact time and optimized
oxidant dosage (Wang et al., 2001).
UV/H2O2 treatment at different chloroamine dosage, and
the NDMAFP was positively related to DON.

參加IWA Micropol & Ecohazard 2009研討會報告
會議時間：2009 June 8 - 10.
會議地點：美國舊金山市
報告人：王根樹（台灣大學公共衛生學系）
1. 前言
Micropollutants 也被稱為新興污染物、微跡有機物、微量物質、
新興關切污染物等，一般包括醫藥製品、個人照護產品的成分、氟化
化合物、水中消毒副產品、奈米物質以及工業添加物等不同物質。這
些化合物質在廢水、地面水、底泥、土壤地、地下水以及飲用水中的
出現不僅引起一般社會公眾人士的關心，對於公共衛生、環保技術等
專業人士而言也是一種挑戰。 以飲用水水質安全而言，新興污染物
所代表者即為水中存在、但吾人對其瞭解不多的微量污染物。這些污
染物未必是「新」的污染物，其在環境中存在的時間或許已極為長久，
但因濃度低，以往受限於分析技術未能有效偵測，因而對其缺乏瞭
解。此外由於其濃度低，傳統處理技術對其去除效率不佳，因而容易
衍生水質安全問題。
Micropol & Ecohazard 2009 是國際水協會（IWA）所屬專門團體
（specialty group）所負責舉辦的一個小型專業研討會，提供各國飲
用水和廢水工程技術人員、環境化學家、水和廢水實業經理人、水文
學家及生態學家溝通和討論的交流平台，共同探討 micropollutants
在水體環境中的傳輸、宿命及移除機制。由於 Micropol & Ecohazard
2009 是 IWA 所屬專門團體所舉辦的小型專業研討會，三天的會期中
議程安排相當緊湊，探討主題涵蓋污染物之偵測、風險評估、處理技
術、水的再利用及管制作為。整個會議議程包括兩個同時進行之
concurrent sessions（口頭論文發表）外，同時每半天安排一場由全
體出席人員共同參與之 Keynote speech。
物，其致癌性高於傳統消毒副產物三鹵甲烷。本次研討會無論口頭或
壁報論文，有多篇關於NDMA的論文發表。由於筆者近年研究方向轉
向NDMA之研究，因此在會場期間主要參與此主題演講之發表，對於
NDMA之分析、研究方法獲益良多。
B. 環境荷爾蒙 –以雌激素為主
近年來可干擾生殖激素活性的環境污染物廣獲世人重視，本次研
討會中關於這類化合物的討論內容以類固醇雌激素為主，對於烷基酚
類化合物（包括 NP 及 OP）亦有所觸及。廢水活性污泥處理法雖可
以有效地去除一些雌激素物質，但仍有部份物質可釋出至天然水體，
且去除效率也隨操作條件、季節而改變。飲用水處理部份，往往依不
同的處理單元而有所差異。加氯消毒或臭氧處理通常可得到不錯的效
果，但是各研究報導的去除率隨著起始濃度、藥劑用量、接觸時間等
而有變異。除了去除效率之外，處理後的產物對人類及生態的危害（包
括健康風險評估）亦是關注的焦點。以台灣地區來講，河川水體檢測
出 NP 已不是新聞，而飲用水中檢出 NP 亦已引起重視。對水質安全
而言，未來如何透過環境水體及飲用水檢測評估 NP 在飲用水處理中
之去除效能並透過風險評估技術評估其對人體健康之潛在危害應為
水質安全研究之重要課題。
C. 個人照護用品 （PPCPs）
藥物的檢測對於是執法把關的第一步；能靈敏、精確地測量用藥
者確實有使用並加以勒戒，為減輕濫用藥物問題中極為重要的一環。
以生活廢水或河水中化學藥物或代謝物之殘留來回推估計藥物使用
量或環境污染為近數年來的新興議題。主要探討化學物質包括三氯
沙、抗生素、顯影劑等物質。這些物質在環境水體中常被檢出，如何
評估其對水質安全之影響尚缺乏研究，因此也是值得重視的研究主
題。以台灣地區來講，雖已開始針對環境水體中個人照護用品展開調
查，但調查之深度及廣度均有加強之空間。目前台灣地區此類研究仍
著重於環境水體調查，在飲水安全領域之研究仍極為缺乏。
