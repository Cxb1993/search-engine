  
Abstract—The aim of this study is to let the tail fin mo-
tion of a robotic fish synchronize with a person’s breathing 
cycle in sitting position. The robotic fish with sensors and a 
compliant tail is capable to perform Carangiform locomo-
tion. The motion of the tail driven by a servo motor can be 
seen as a nonlinear oscillator. Besides, a nonlinear oscilla-
tor is used to describe the relative movement of a person’s 
chest circumference. This oscillator is connected with the 
fin oscillator through one-way coupling. Simulation  and 
experiment results present that an approximate synchro-
nization between two motions can be achieved by selecting 
a proper coupling gain. 
 
Keywords—robotic fish, breathing cycle, compliant 
tail, oscillator. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
It is well known that people suffer from occupational 
stress not only work inefficiently, but also become de-
pressed, anxious, exhausted and tensioned more easily 
[1]. How to reduce stress in workplace is therefore an 
important issue. Several research [2-3] have shown that 
watching fish swimming can reduce elders’ stress and 
make patients with Alzheimer’s disease become calmer. 
Since office aquariums are popular, a robotic fish which 
receives human physiological signals and reacts properly 
is a choice of relieving employees’ stress. To let a robotic 
fish interact with a person, this study tries to synchronize 
the tail motion of a fish robot with human breathing cycle. 
Robotic fishes are designed to mimic the motion of fish, 
given their ability to hover precisely and turn swiftly [4]. 
A review of fish swimming modes for aquatic locomo-
tion provides an overview of the swimming mechanisms 
of fish [5-6]. Fish swim using (a) body and/or caudal fin 
(BCF) locomotion, or (b) median and/or paired fin (MPF) 
locomotion. MPF locomotion is normally applied at low 
speed, offering better maneuverability and propulsive 
efficiency, while BCF movement is used to achieve 
higher thrust and acceleration. Both BCF and MPF lo-
comotion are based on a continuous set of swimming 
modes - undulation and oscillation. Oscillation can be 
derived from increasing the wavelength of undulation. 
To control the robotic fish and let it perform BCF style 
swimming, a control method derived from the concept of 
Central pattern generators (CPGs) is used. CPGs are the 
neural networks in animal spinal cords which can pro-
duce rhythmic outputs without rhythmic sensory inputs 
[7]. CPG models have been used of controlling different 
types of robots such as hexapod, quadruped and swim-
ming robots. Research of using CPG models to control 
locomotion of animals and robots are reviewed in [7]. 
Biomimetic underwater robots controlled by the CPG 
based schemes which implemented as a system of several 
coupled nonlinear oscillators, are presented in [8] and [9]. 
Both of their results show that the CPG-based method 
could make the robots overcome randomly perturbations 
and swim stably because of the limit cycle behavior. 
Similarly, part of the human respiratory system can be 
described by several coupled nonlinear oscillators 
[10-12]. Simulation results of human respiratory me-
chanics are present in [13] and [14]. The passive respir-
atory system includes lungs, rib cage and abdomen, is 
driven by a time varying muscle force. This muscle force 
produced by a respiratory center described by a Liénard 
system is present in [10]. Besides, a mathematical model 
of the human cardiovascular system derived from ex-
perimental evidence and physiological knowledge was 
proposed [11-12]. Their model consisted of five coupled 
nonlinear oscillators with linear or parametric couplings, 
and reproduced the main characteristic obtained from 
experiments. Therefore, this study uses a nonlinear os-
cillator to approximate the breathing cycle measured 
from the variation of chest circumference. This oscillator 
is then connected to the tail oscillator through one-way 
coupling. Simulation and experiment results present the 
tail oscillator can synchronize approximately to the 
breathing oscillator with a strong enough coupling term. 
II. MECHANICS AND MOTION CONTROL OF THE 
ROBOTIC FISH 
A. Compliant mechanisms and rigid body dynamics 
Fig. 1 shows the robotic fish and a compliant tail 
controlled by one servo motor. The dynamic model of 
the compliant tail of the robotic fish is described using 
the pseudo-rigid-body dynamic model (PRBDM) [15] 
which derives from the pseudo-rigid-body model 
(PRBM) and Lagrangian formulation. The concept of 
PRBM is the deflection of a flexible cantilever beam 
with constant cross section and linear material properties 
can be modeled by two rigid links joined at a pivot point 
along the beam [16]. The compliance of the beam is 
represented by a torsional spring at the pivot point. From 
above, the compliant tail is simplified as two flexible 
cantilever beams, which can be described as three rigid 
links with two torsional springs and dampers locate at the

C. Oscillator-based model 
Equation (6) shows the dynamic model of the robotic 
fish which is a nonlinear system with input torque from 
motor. To simulate fish style swimming, appropriate 
input is applied so sway and yaw motions of the tail fin 
can be rhythmic. This input is designed by treating the 
sway motion as a self-excited oscillator [9]. By adjusting 
the parameters of the input, the oscillator can perform 
stable limit cycle oscillation. A stable limit cycle has the 
property that neighboring trajectories will converge to it. 
To design the input, first the sway equation is assumed to 
be an independent equation where the coupling terms 
between bx , by , 0 , 1  and 2  are relatively small. 
This assumption is valid when the fin is oscillating with 
small amplitudes and angles. Then the sway equation can 
be represented as: 
 
 4 1 4 1 1 1 1 inputI B k                                (7) 
 
where   is the small perturbation resulting from the 
off-diagonal terms of the mass and damping matrices. 4I  
is the mass or moment of inertia term.  4 1 0 1 1B        is the nonlinear damping term. To 
create stable limit cycle oscillations, the input torque 
from motor is designed as: 
 
 4 1 0 1 1 1 1 4input P I s t                            (8) 
 
where 4P , 0  and 1  are input parameters.  s t  is the 
synchronizing input that generates a phase difference 
between two different oscillators. Substituting input  by 
(8), (7) can be rewritten as: 
    21 1 1 0 1 0 1 s t                                (9) 
 
where  0 0 4 0I    ,  1 1 4 1I     and 
 0 1 4 4k P I   . 0  and 1  affect the shape of the 
limit cycle, and 0  affects the oscillating frequency. To 
obtain a biased oscillation centered at 1b , (8) can be 
modified as: 
 
 4 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 4 1input bP k P                       (10) 
 
Then (9) becomes

III. SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN THE TAIL MOTION 
AND BREATHING CYCLE 
A. The model of the breathing cycle 
The model is obtained by approximating the breathing 
cycle in sitting position. To measure the breathing cycles, 
the NeXus-4 biofeedback machine with respiration 
sensor made by Mind Media Corporation are used. The 
respiration sensor is placed on the chest to measure the 
variation of chest circumference. Because the signals 
from the sensor are amplified and an offset is applied, 
they only present the relative movement. To simplify the 
modeling procedure, a Rayleigh oscillator similar to (9) 
is used to approximate the signals:  
 
  21 0 0r r r r r r rx x x x                          (12) 
 
where rx  is the value of the signal measured by the 
respiration sensor, and r  is the oscillating frequency of

V. CONCLUSIONS 
This study presents a model which connects the ro-
botic fish system with human breathing cycle in sitting 
position. A robotic fish with a compliant tail is controlled 
by an oscillator-based method so it can swim stably. The 
breathing cycle is described by a nonlinear oscillator 
approximated from breathing signals measured by a 
respiration sensor. To synchronize the tail motion of the 
robot fish with breathing cycle, one-way coupling is used. 
From simulation and experiment results, approximate 
synchronization between two motions can be achieved 
with strong enough coupling term.

OCEANS event. 
4. There will be no IEEE/OES or MTS awards luncheons. It is recommended that 
“box lunches” be provided to the attendees in the exhibit areas on all three days. 
All coffee breaks will also be held in the exhibit area. Therefore, the floor plans 
for the exhibits should incorporate tables and chairs throughout the event area to 
allow socializing and enjoyment of the refreshments and lunches. The exhibitor 
reception will also be held in the exhibit hall on Tuesday which will also require 
adequate space for refreshments and drinks. Based on discussions with the TICC 
representatives, such social events may require special carpeting or protective 
covers in the area. This should be confirmed and incorporated in the budget. 
5. Although the Taipei 101 building is an excellent location to hold an ADCOM 
dinner, the cost to host a dinner at that location seems excessive. It is 
recommended that more cost effective locations be considered for the event. 
6. There were several potential sites suggested for the Wednesday evening 
banquet. The recommendation is to hold the banquet at the Grand Hotel. The 
location, views and décor will provide an excellent reflection of the city and 
country. 
7. The poster session would probably fit well in the hallway outside the exhibit 
hall, however, additional security would probably be required for any posters or 
exhibits outside the main halls and should be budgeted. If the exhibits should not 
fill the halls, then incorporation of the posters in the exhibit area should also be 
considered. 
8. There is excellent potential to include student educational programs and 
competitions such as ROV and/or AUV events during either the OCEANS event 
or in conjunction with the Expo. This should be investigated further. Karin Lynn 
forwarded info regarding OES, MTS and MATE programs to the LOC. 
9. The site visit resulted in the following action items: 
 Provide review of the presentation and budget prior to the Seattle conference. 
 Provide a list of exhibitors from recent OCEANS conferences.

Abstract—Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are popular 
tools nowadays in marine exploration and oceanographic 
research. How to navigate an UUV in unknown or unstructured 
environments without long baseline or short baseline information 
are always a challenging problem. Side Scan Sonar (SSS) are 
common payloads on UUVs for navigation and environment 
detection. This study proposes a real time SSS seafloor mapping 
method combining the motion information and the observation 
model of the sonar to localize the UUVs. The working principle of 
SSS, sonar footprint region calculation and the acoustic velocity 
in water are considered during the feature localization 
procedure. An occupancy grid mapping algorithm is then used to 
map the seafloor combining the uncertainties of UUV’s motion 
and measurement errors from the real time observations. 
Scanlines’ information instead of the SSS images during the 
landmarks’ position detection process was implemented on an 
UUV and experimental results conducted in a sandy seabed with 
concrete targets are demonstrated.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) are becoming a 
common tool for marine exploration and military missions. It is 
a stable platform for most kinds of subsea sensors and can be 
submerged secretly. Since the most of underwater areas are 
unknown, this poses a difficult challenge for precise vehicle 
positioning. Side Scan Sonar (SSS) systems are generally used 
for seafloor mapping and targets detection / searching in the 
subsea areas. Nowadays, SSS are common payloads for UUVs. 
The SSS produces an image representation by the 
backscattering and reflection of signals to show the seabed 
morphology and features [1,2]. Most of sonar signals are 
usually enhanced by time varying amplification gains in data 
processing to improve the quality of resulting image. In 
addition, the imaging process can be simulated and built by 
Bistatic models [3]. The acoustic signals of SSS are transmitted 
in both vertical and horizontal plane to project an area with 
different resolutions in along-track and across-track direction 
on the seafloor which is called “footprint” [4,5]. Due to the 
characteristics of SSS which can detect underwater objects and 
classify the seafloor properties, the use of information extracted 
from SSS can offer a potential improvement of underwater 
navigation for UUVs. However, most of data processing and 
target detection methods of mosaic-based SSS image are 
usually offline and that leads to great difficulty to navigate 
UUVs using SSS information. For navigation purpose of 
UUVs, capturing the environment information in real-time is 
necessary. Carmichael, et al. (1996) [6], Ruiz et al. (2004) [7], 
and Zen et al. (2005) [8] all reported the method of underwater 
vehicle localization using SSS images. Real-time localization 
using SSS images is still under investigation due to the 
landmark images must be processed after collecting a certain 
amount of seafloor data which usually results in time delays in 
the navigation data. SSS images are composed of many 
scanlines. A scanline stands for a transmission-reception cycle 
which is perpendicular to the course and is easier to be 
processed in real-time because a scanline can be obtained in 
milliseconds and data size is small. In order to implement the 
navigation from SSS, developing a new detection system that 
processed in real-time of sonar scanline’s information is 
necessary. 
This work investigates the gird-based mapping method and 
uncertainty estimations of object to locate the seafloor target 
positions in real time for UUV navigation. Beyond that, using 
scanline’s information instead of the SSS images generally 
used now for landmark’s positions The article is composed of 
five sections. Section II introduces the detection technique of 
SSS. Section III describes the mapping and localization method 
using the scanline’s information. Section IV presents 
experimental results. Finally, concluding remarks are given in 
Section V. 
II. DETECTION METHOD 
The purpose of this section is to introduce a feasible 
method for target detection automatically in real-time using 
SSS scanlines to implement the UUVs navigation. 
Fig. 1 shows the work flow of detection method of SSS 
data. Each scanline was processed by down-sampling, 
corrected by time varying gains, and normalization firstly. 
Then all the scanlines were classified to separate into two 
results:  with target or without target. Data without any targets 
will be skipped, but scanlines with targets will be further 
processed using adaptive threshold to mark the target positions.

Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 display scanline signals with and without 
target processed by adaptive threshold method out of the 
concrete target showed in Fig. 5, respectively. Results 
demonstrate significant effectiveness of using the method to 
detect targets from scanlines. 
III. MAPPING AND LOCALIZATION 
A map constructed from the scanlines is to locate the 
targets and be updated co-currently while the new observation 
is obtained. The observation model was based on footprint 
which is a small area from sonar projected on the seabed. The 
uncertainty of the target location was due to the error produced 
by the roll, pitch, and yaw of UUVs’ motion. Most of studies to 
estimate the targets location uncertainty were using feature-
based stochastic map which estimates the spatial relationships, 
the uncertainties, and the inter-dependencies of features [11]. 
But the drawback of this method to calculate the uncertainties 
is too large computation load to implement in real-time when 
there are many detected features. The occupancy grid mapping 
method can effectively resolve the problem and is more 
appropriate for this work.

Figure 5.  Target overview 
The occupancy grid mapping method creates a two-
dimensional array of cell which is corresponding to a 
horizontal grid of the desired resolution. Each cell, C, is related 
to the variable, s (C), which is a discrete random variable with 
two exclusive and exhaustive states, occupied and empty. The 
probabilistic estimate of state of each cell is defined as P ( s (C) 
= occ ) or P ( s (C) = emp ). It means the probability of the cell 
is an occupied cell or an empty cell, respectively. Furthermore, 
there are several measurements information associated with 
each grid cell. Given the sensor reading, z1:t , from SSS and the 
UUV’s pose, x1:t . The desired probability of the grid cell can 
be defined as conditional probability P ( s (Ci) = occ | z1:t, x1:t) 
and the occupancy probability estimate of each grid cell now is 
becoming the binary Bayes filter which employs the log odds 
over the probability representation to avoid numerical 
instabilities for probabilities near zero or one. Therefore, the 
mapping problem of this work could be represented as: 
1: 1:

P s C occ z xl

                  (6) 
which is constant represented as a log odds ratio. The term, P 
( s (Ci) = occ ) of Eq. (6) depended on expected complexity of 
UUV surroundings. It was usually set to 0.5 in typical 
environments. Eq. (7) was implemented the inverse 
measurement model in log odds forms to denote the grid cell 
probability of occupancy, s (Ci), based on the measurement zt 
and vehicle’s pose xt.

The probability of the grid cell could be obtained from the 
SSS observation and its navigation measurements. Because of 
the motion effect on the swathe, the target position should be 
corrected by the vehicle’s pitch, roll and yaw angle before 
localizing the target position. Cobra et al. (1992) [12] 
indicated the situation caused by these three angles. Fig. 6 
shows the rolling motion effect on the sonar coverage. The 
dashed line area indicates the coverage area with zero roll 
angles and solid line represents area covered by the sonar 
when the vehicle rolls. The pitch angle causes the forward and 
the back scan as shown in Fig. 7. The dash line shows the 
vehicle swims horizontally and the solid line shows the 
backward scan with the angle, pφ . The pitch effect for sonar 
footprint positions is shown in Fig. 8. After correcting the 
vehicle motion and slant range of SSS, a detected target has a 
coordinate point which is related to the center of UUV. The 
position of the target can be represented by Eq. (8).

Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 present the result of inverse measurement 
model which the covariance represented by an ellipse was 
obtained from Eq. (19). Once the detection result is with target 
present, the algorithm will return the log probability of the cell. 
Also, the log probability will be obtained if detection result 
indicates target absence. Otherwise, if the cell is outside of the 
region of footprint, this model will assign to this cell with a 
prior probability value. 
Fig. 11 indicates mapping procedure in a single time step. 
The target detection block represents the procedure of signal 
processing without deciding the location of the target, and the 
location of the target would be obtained in the occupancy grid 
mapping block. Finally, the system use local map to update the 
global map in every time step.

where 1m and 2m  are the grid map of true map and the SSS 
generated map. Table 2 lists the correlation coefficient of the 
grid maps of Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 with respect to the true map. It 
indicates that compensating the effect of UUV motion has 
significant effect in reducing the map distortion. Furthermore, 
compounding uncertainties of SSS and the uncertainties of 
UUV’s motion sensors, the resulting map is much more 
accurate than considering only the UUV’s motion effects.

were less certain compared to the time while the vehicle was 
closing to the target. The distribution of the particles was

target area. When UUV was moved away from the target, the 
trajectory started to become not certain and the distribution was
