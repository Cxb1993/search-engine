According to the obtained results, the robust stability problem for the above system is also
solved. Several stability and instability test conditions are then presented. Furthermore, all
obtained results are also applied to solve the same problems for discrete systems with
multiple time delays and highly structured perturbations. Comparing to those appeared in
the literature, it is seen that this research is more general. We believe that the proposed
results are helpful for pole-assignment of discrete time-delay systems.
三、 內容
It is known that the investigation for eigenvalues of linear time-invariant systems can be
classified into two categories: (1) the D-stability test problem [1, 4, 11, 14, 15, 25] and (2)
the root clustering test problem [5, 7-9, 16, 23, 26, 27]. The first category focuses on the
robustness of the stable pole-placement, which assigns all eigenvalues of the nominal
system in a specified disk region of the complex plane. The second category finds
conditions to ensure that all system eigenvalues are clustered in some restricted regions of
the complex plane, which may not be stable regions. Obviously the latter is more general.
In real-life systems, time delay(s) occurs as a result of the information transmission,
natural property of system elements, computation of variables and so on [10, 13, 19].
Furthermore, because of the use of approximate system model for simplicity, data errors
for evaluation, changes in environment conditions, aging, etc, perturbations also exist
naturally. Therefore, time delay(s) and perturbation(s) ought to be considered in the
system models. Since time delays and perturbations will change the characteristic equation
and increase the number of eigenvalues, it becomes very difficult to analyze the locations
of eigenvalue for systems with time delays and perturbations. Recently, the research for
discrete perturbed systems subjected to time delays has been of great interest. A number of
results have been proposed for the mentioned systems [11, 13, 17, 20-22]. However, for
the eigenvalue analysis, almost existing results focused on the D-stability test problem [11,
13, 21]. It seems that only one work has discussed the estimation problem for eigenvalue
regions of discrete systems with a single time delay and highly structured perturbations
[12]. As mentioned in the above descriptions, the root clustering test problem is more
general than the D-stability test problem. Extending methods proposed in [12], this paper
hence addresses the root clustering test problem for discrete interval systems subjected to
multiple time delays. By means of linear algebraic theorems, induced norm, and matrix
measure techniques, several criteria are proposed to test the root clustering problem.
Different restricted regions of the complex plane that all eigenvalues are located inside are
tested: (1) half plane, (2) strip region, (3) rectangular region, (4) internal region of a disk,
(5) external region of a disk, and (6) ring region. From these present results, the stability
