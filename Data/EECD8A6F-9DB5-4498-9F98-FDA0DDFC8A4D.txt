1. INTRODUCTION 
 Since 2000, multiaxial low cycle fatigue tests of 
solder materials used in the electronic / microsystem 
packagings, in particular, uniaxial and shear strains 
coupling with temperature, frequency controlled cyclic 
tests, by using mini-size dog-bone bulk specimens has 
been very active in the academic research. The data of 
cyclic stress-strain responses are used to support many 
types of constitutive theories with / without damage 
effects [1~4]. However, the relationships between the 
fatigue life and their corresponding inelastic strain 
amplitudes are still remained in the level of empirical 
formulae, e.g. the Coffin-Manson relation, the Morrow’s 
4 parameters damage equation, the Miller-Brown 
equation with critical plane criterion, etc. [5, 6]. In the 
industrial applications, more real specimens addressed 
directly to the design life, e.g. BGA solder joints are 
preferred to use in the investigation of low cycle fatigue 
life under oblique displacement controlled test. Least 
square lines are used to correlate the life and the 
displacement amplitudes applied at the grip systems of 
solder joint specimens [7]. Obviously, there are lacks of 
communication from both sites of academic and industry. 
 Recently, the first author of this paper constructed a 
workable methodology to transfer the data of hysteresis 
loops of force-oblique displacement of BGA solder joint 
specimens under oblique displacement controlled cyclic 
test[7], into the hysteresis loops of stress-strain of solder 
balls under cyclically proportional straining test[8].  
 Here, the methodology used in ref. [3, 4, 8] was 
extended into the damage loops of force-displacement 
responses of BGA solder joint specimens and their 
fatigue initiation life under oblique angle. 
2. CYCLICALLY DAMAGE RESPONSES OF BGA 
SOLDER JOINTS UNDER OBLIQUE 
DISPLACEMENT CYCLIC TESTS 
 From the contents in [3], the max．load response at 
Nth damaged cycle of displacement test with oblique 
angle Φ , can be employed to compute the value of 
corresponding damage factor ΦD :  
Φ Φ Φ Φ Φmax max max
D =[F (0) - F (D )] F (0)
 
(1) 
Denote the load Φ ΦF (D )  vs. displacement Φd , at Nth 
cycle measured from the max．point of load as Φ ΦF (D )  
vs. Φd , the Eq. (1) leads to 
Φ ΦΦ ΦF (D ) F (0)(1- D )    (2) 
Within the linear range of unloading, the damage 
stiffness of testing system Φ ΦK (D )  which is defined by 
Φ Φ ΦF (D ) d , becomes Φ Φ Φ ΦK (D ) K (0)(1-D ) ,  
here ΦK (0)  is determined from the stable hysteresis 
loops. Also, from [3], the damaged elastic modulus 
Φ 0 ΦE(D ) E (1-D )  and the shear modulus 
Φ 0 Φμ(D ) μ (1-D ) . 
 The testing system with BGA solder joint 
specimens, [7], Fig. 1a, can be treated, as a serial 
combination of linear grip system and a mesoscale solder 
ball (i.e. a representative of all solder balls in the joint) 
[8] with total area SA  and standoff height SL , see Fig. 
1b. The linearly unloading behavior of testing system 
leads to a damage elastic response of solder ball with the 
damage elastic stiffness Φ ΦS Φ S ΦK (D ) K (0)(1- D ) , here, 
Φ

4. ENDOCHRONIC THEORY OF FATIGUE 
INITIATION LIFE UNDER CYCLICALLY 
PROPORTIONAL STRAINING PATHS 
 A thermodynamic formulation of cyclically damage 
factor D in the isotropically endochronic viscoplasticity 
had been discussed [3]. The intrinsic damage time scale 
D
Z  was defined as  
IN
D DdZ A de 
 (17) 
and the evolution equation of damage was proposed as 
D DdD dZ B G  (18) 
here G the elastic strain energy density release rate 
whose mathematical form can be provided by the 
thermodynamic free energy with internal state variables 
and damage factor. Both of DA  and DB  are material 
damage parameters. Combination of Eqs. (17) (18) gave 
the constitutive equation of damage, i.e.

applications of Eq. (19) in the cyclically uniaxial strain 
and simple shear strain test were discussed separately  
[3, 9], a cyclically damage factor ΦD  in cyclically 
proportional straining path will be investigated in the 
following contents.  
4.1 Damage Equation of Cyclically Proportional 
Straining Paths 
 The damage per cycle at the Nth cycle of cyclically 
proportional straining, Φ N(δD δN)  can be found by 
taking approximation in S

 by the value +aσ 3  (
+
aσ  
is the damaged effective cyclic stress amplitude at Nth

β(Φ)=0.356( 2-Φ)+1  with 0β(Φ ) 1 , ref Fig.5.  
 From Fig. 5, the master curve predicted by     
Φ - LCM equation can be represented by a straight  
(least square) line with C=0.616, and 0H =0.269.  
Given values of C and 0H , Eq. (28) can be used to 
compute 3B  and 1B :  
When INa0.34 e 0.74%  , 3B 0.73 , 1B 0.026 , 
When INa 0.74% e 2%  , 3B 0.103 , 1B 0.082 , 
When INae 2% , 3B 0.543 , 1B 0.015 . 
5. Φ –Modify Lee’s BGA ( Φ -LBGA) Equation of 
IN (Φ)  for BGA Solder Joints under Cyclically 
Φ  Displacement Tests 
 In the conversion of INae  into a d (Φ) from Eq. (15), 
it must be aware of different a d (Φ) values for different 
Φ
 
at the ae 2.0% . Hence, after substituting Eq.(15) 
into Eq.(28), the resultant equation of endochronic 
fatigue life prediction for BGA solder joint specimens 
under cyclically Φ  oblique displacement tests, can be 
named as the Φ - modify Lee’s BGA ( Φ -LBGA) 
equation, i.e. 
 
d2 22 CdCd
1a I 0d (Φ)(N (Φ)) H d (Φ) β(Φ)     (30)

o 0.554

(31)

a a Id 28.8μm,d (N (90 )) =136.7  
o 0.554
a a Id >28.8μm,d (N (90 )) =300  
(33)
 
The fatigue initiation life IN (Φ)  predicted under 
ad (Φ) and Φ are plotted in Fig. 5. As shown in the 
figure, all IN (Φ) data of BGA solder joints are well 
predicted by Φ - modify Lee’s BGA equation. Ref. [7] 
provided a series of almost parallel lines for life 
prediction which are reproduced in Fig.5 for comparison. 
Within the 1st range, both lines are very close, since 
these are all very close to the life data. However, when 
ad  in the 2
nd  range, predictions of life from both lines 
are very different. These differences are minor in the 
applications for life below 100 cycles. However, when 
the scatter of IN (Φ)  under ad (Φ)  become wider, the 
lines drawn in ref. [7] will become more difficult in 
rationalization. In this situation, lines based on the   
Φ - LBGA predictions supported by the theory of 
damage-coupled endochronic viscoplastically are 
superior.  
6. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper, the damage-coupled endochronic 
viscoplaticity was employed to study the damaged 
mechanical behavior-force amplitude dropped responses 
and the fatigue initiation life of Sn/3.5Ag/0.75Cu BGA 
solder joints under oblique displacement cyclic tests. 
The Φ - modified Lee-Coffin-Manson equation derived 
for fatigue initiation life of solder ball is used to derived 
the Φ - modified Lee’s BGA equation. The well 
predicting capability in the Sn/3.5Ag/0.75Cu BGA solder 
joints specimens can be employed as a vehicle to study 
the other BGA solder joints with various solder materials, 
or thermo-mechanical loadings.
