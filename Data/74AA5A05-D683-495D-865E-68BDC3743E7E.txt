 2
angle between lateral roots, and total length after intersection point, etc. Thus, the architecture of the 
root system plays an important role in the mechanical behavior of soils permeated with roots.  
The mechanism of the soil-root interaction and the contribution of plant roots to the shear strength of 
the soil have been studied analytically (Waldron, 1977; Wu et al, 1979; Waldron and Dakessian, 1981; 
Wu et al., 1988) and experimentally (Waldron, 1977; Tobias, 1995; Operstein and Frydman, 2000; 
Docker and Hubble, 2008; Fan and Su, 2008). Additionally, a simple root reinforcement model, based 
on the force equilibrium principle, for evaluating the shear strength increase that roots can provide 
have been developed for vertical roots (Waldron, 1977; Wu et al, 1979) and inclined roots (Gray and 
Leiser, 1982). However, experimental studies showed that the shear strength increases provided by 
plant roots were considerably less than those estimated using the simple root reinforcement model 
(Operstein and Frydman, 2000; Docker and Hubble, 2008; Fan and Su, 2008). The mechanism of the 
shearing resistance contributed by plant roots is inherently an underground 3-D soil-root interaction 
problem. The architecture or branching characteristics of the root system plays an important role in the 
mobilization of the increase in the shearing resistance and in the protection of soil mass from erosion 
or shearing failure. The root system geometry and root topology determine the force transmission in 
the entire root system, and in turn affect the performance of the soil reinforcement.  
Docker and Hubble (2008) reported RAR-based estimates of the increased shear resistance of soils 
provided by four common Australian riparian tree species, Casuarina glauca, Eucalyptus amplifolia, 
Eucalyptus elata, and Acacia floribunda, using in-situ shear tests. At equivalent RAR values, roots of 
Acacia floribunda demonstrate the greatest contribution of shear strength increase to soil blocks of 
these four plant species. These results may be induced by the difference in both the geometry of the 
root system and the tensile strength of the roots for different plant species. Docker and Hubble (2009) 
further linked the RAR-based shear strength increase provided by plant roots with the root architecture 
system of these four plant species. The RAR values of the root system were measured in terms of the 
spatial distribution (vertical and lateral extent) below the ground surface. Eucalyptus elata exhibits the 
greatest RARs in soil zones beneath it, while Eucalyptus amplifolia reinforces a greater volume of soil 
than other three species. Eucalyptus elata provides the highest values of increased soil shear strength 
followed by Acacia floribunda, Eucalyptus amplifolia and Casuarina glauca as the spatial distribution 
of RARs in the root system is taken into account. Norris et al (2008) indicated that root systems 
composed of deep taproots and sinker roots crossing the slip surface would be ideal to reinforce the 
soil against shallow slope failure. A large number of roots with small diameters would develop into a 
root-permeated soil matrix that had a better shearing resistance. At the top or toe of a slope, the heart 
root system, with deep sinkers and wide-spreading lateral roots, would be the ideal root architecture to 
protect the soil from slope failure. In the middle of a slope, tap or heart root system would have 
sufficient depth to interact with the slip surface and provide better shearing resistance in soils. 
Reubens et al (2007) classified the root architecture in terms of three characteristics, i.e., size 
characteristics, branching pattern, and amount of roots per soil area or volume and concluded that a 
combination of a dense rooting pattern of fine roots, which are important in providing the tensile 
resistance, in the top layer with coarse, deeply penetrating roots, good in providing bending and 
shearing resistance, is most beneficial against shallow slope failure. The importance of the root system 
architecture in the mechanical mechanism of roots against shearing failure has been well 
acknowledged. The effect of the orientation of reinforcing fibers on the increase of the shearing 
resistance of the soil has been well known in the theoretical analyses (Gray and Leiser, 1982) and in 
the laboratory studies (Gray and Ohashi, 1983). Quantitative research, however, on the effect of the 
architecture of the root system on the contribution of roots to the shear strength of the soil or soil 
fixation has been limited. 
To investigate the role of the root system architecture in providing the shearing resistance to the 
root-permeated soils, in-situ shear tests on soil blocks permeated with various root architectures were 
carried out in this research. Five plant species were used in this research. Root characteristics, 
including root length, root diameter, root orientation with respect to the horizontal (shear) plane, were 
measured and recorded after each in-situ shear test. Correlations between the shear strength increase 
and the tensile force in roots per unit area of soil, tR, were obtained for plant species with various root 
architectures. The relevance of the architecture of the root system to the shear strength increase 
provided by plant roots in the soil was discussed in this paper.

surface. Soils at the shear plane were sampled to measure the moisture content in the laboratory 
following the completion of the shear tests.  
Most of the plant roots tend to concentrate at the shallow depth. Thus, the normal stress on the shear 
plane of root-permeated soil blocks conducted in this research is considerably low. Additionally, roots 
have little influence on the friction angle of root-permeated soils with respect to that of root-free soils 
(Gray and Ohashi, 1983), and the shear strength increase of root-permeated soils with respect to 
root-free soils is equated to the increase in apparent cohesion (Waldron, 1977; Coppin and Richards, 
1990; Operstein and Frydman, 2000). Thus, in-situ shear tests on root-permeated soil specimens were 
carried out without additional vertical loads on top of the specimen in this study. Additionally, in-situ 
shear tests on root-free soils were also carried out in this study. 
The soil moisture content of the specimen was controlled to be in a range from 12% to 14%. Prior to 
the execution of shearing, a TDR-based soil moisture meter was inserted in the soil specimen at depths 
of 0.075 m, 0.1 m, and 0.15 m to measure the soil moisture content and to ensure if the required soil 
moisture content is reached. 
2.4. Measurement of the root structure 
Diameter, quantity, length, and orientation of roots were measured and counted following completion 
of in-situ shear tests. Measurement of the structure of the root system is shown in Fig. 5. Root 
orientations were measured by projecting the root structure on a vertical white board with pre-drawn 
lines and associated orientation readings. The definition of the root orientation is shown in Fig. 6, and 
the root orientation ranges from 0° to 180°. Root diameters were measured using a digital caliper. In 
addition to record the architecture of the entire root system, the roots crossing the shear plane were 
specifically marked in the measurement of the root structure.  
3. Experimental Results  
3.1. In-situ shear tests 
The relationship between shear stress and shear displacement for root-permeated soils subjected to 
shear is affected by the pattern of root growth and can be used in evaluating the capability of vegetated 
slopes to withstand large soil displacement before collapse. The presence of strong vertical roots and 
the penetrating depth of roots may affect the mobilization of the shear stress considerably at a 
moderate to large shear displacement based on the test results obtained herein. Figure 7 shows two 
typical relationships between shear stress and shear displacement obtained in this research for 
root-permeated soils subjected to shear. One of them (Fig.7(a)) shows a strain hardening behavior at a 
large shear displacement, and the other (Fig.7(b)) shows a reduction in the post-peak shear stress at a 
shear displacement greater than about 2 to 5cm. Most of the shear stress vs. shear displacement 
relationships obtained in this research demonstrate a strain hardening behavior at a large shear 
displacement. The shear strength increase provided by roots in the soil was estimated by the 
relationship of shear displacement vs. the difference of shear stress of root-permeated soils with 
respect to root-free soils at the same soil moisture content. The shear stress vs. shear displacement 
relationship for root-free soils subjected to shear is also shown in Fig. 7. The shear strength increase 
(∆S) for root-permeated soils subjected to shear was estimated by locating the yield stress in the shear 
stress difference vs. shear displacement relationship if a strain hardening behavior was obtained (Fig. 
7(a)). The yield stress was obtained by the intersection of the tangent line of the initial portion with the 
line tangent to the portion of shear stress difference vs. shear displacement curve at a large shear 
displacement, as shown in Fig. 7(a). The shear strength increase was estimated by the peak shear stress 
in the shear stress difference vs. shear displacement relationship if a reduction in the post-peak shear 
stress was obtained (Fig.7(b)).     
3.2. Tensile tests on roots 
The ultimate tensile strength of roots with various diameters for the plant species used in this research 
was measured using a computerized-controlled tensile tester, Shimadzu Inc., Model Ag-10tg, 
following the completion of in-situ shear tests. Roots with approximately uniform diameter and with a 
length greater than 0.2 m were selected and used in the tensile tests. Root diameters used in the tensile 
tests ranged from 0.5 mm to about 7~8 mm. Root length between the top and bottom grips of the 
tensile tester was 0.1 m. The rate of extension was 0.02 m/min. The root diameter near the location of 
 6
species are approximately in linear relationships. Regressions of ∆S against tR based on root strength 
crossing the shear plane yield the following equations:  
RS 0.338 t∆ =       R2=0.81 (Roots of Linden Hibiscus)   (7) 
RS 0.458 t∆ =      R2=0.84 (Roots of Japanese Mallotus)  (8) 
RS 0.688 t∆ =      R2=0.91 (Roots of Chinese tallow-tree) (9) 
RS 0.3t∆ =        R2=0.94 (Roots of Ironwood)        (10) 
RS 0.87 t∆ =       R2=0.93 (Roots of White Popinac)    (11) 
The ratios of the shear strength increase (∆S) over the tensile force of roots per unit area of the soil (tR) 
are in a range from 0.3 to 0.87 and are quite varied for the plant species tested herein. The ratios of ∆S 
over tR value established for the plant species tested herein are considerably less than that based on the 
simple root reinforcement model, where ∆S≅1.15~1.2tR (Wu et al, 1979; Gray and Leiser, 1982). The 
roots of White Popinac provide the greatest shear strength increase amongst the plant species tested, 
followed by roots of Chinese tallow-tree, Japanese Mallotus, Linden hibiscus, and Ironwood.  
Furthermore, the contribution of plant roots to the shear strength increase of the soil may not be 
limited to the roots crossing the shear plane. Tensile stresses of short roots within the soil zone 
undergoing shear deformation, i.e. the width of the shear zone, may be somewhat mobilized, and short 
roots may provide shearing resistance to the soil (Fan and Su, 2008). To investigate the efficiency of 
the architecture of the entire root system in providing the shear strength increase, the tR value was also 
estimated based on the entire root system and was plotted against the shear strength increase (∆S) for 
each plant species tested herein. Roots with diameters greater than 20mm were excluded in the 
estimation of tR value. Figure 10 shows the correlations between ∆S and tR, based on all roots in a 
single plant, for each plant species, and these two items are approximately in a linear relationship. 
Regressions of ∆S against tR based on the root strength of all roots in the root system yield the 
following equations for each plant species tested:  
RS 0.112 t∆ =       R2=0.88 (Roots of Linden Hibiscus)   (12) 
RS 0.159 t∆ =      R2=0.86 (Roots of Japanese Mallotus)  (13) 
RS 0.326 t∆ =      R2=0.81 (Roots of Chinese tallow-tree) (14) 
RS 0.172 t∆ =      R2=0.89 (Roots of Ironwood)         (15) 
RS 0.49 t∆ =       R2=0.96 (Roots of White Popinac)    (16) 
The roots of White Popinac provide the greatest shear strength increase amongst the plant species 
tested in terms of the tR value estimated based on all roots in the root system, followed by roots of 
Chinese tallow-tree, Ironwood, Japanese Mallotus, and Linden Hibiscus. The ratio of ∆S over tR 
estimated based on all roots in the root system is about 56%, 47%, 57%, 34%, and 33% of that based 
on the root strength crossing the shear plane for roots of White Popinac, Chinese tallow-tree, Ironwood, 
Japanese Mallotus, and Linden Hibiscus, respectively. These values can be defined as the efficiency of 
the root system in providing shearing resistance to the soil. Roots of White Popinac, Chinese 
tallow-tree, and Ironwood are more efficient in providing shearing resistance to the soil than other 
plant species tested herein.  
The equations listed in equations (7-16) can be easily used in the engineering practice to estimate the 
shear strength increase provided by plant roots. These equations, however, are considered conservative 
if the tensile stresses mobilized in roots can be reasonably estimated and used in these equations. 
3.4. Description of the architecture of the root system  
Quantitative description of an entire root system in 3-D condition is not an easy task. This paper 
attempts to quantify the root structure in terms of root orientation, number of roots, and cross-sectional 
area of roots by projecting and mapping the root system on a vertical plane parallel to the shear 
 8
that inclined at 60°, the optimum orientation, with respect to the shear plane, respectively. Additionally, 
Gray and Leiser (1982) proposed a root reinforcement model for a single inclined root within the soil 
subjected to shear. The shear strength increase (∆S) provided by inclined roots is given by the 
following equations (Gray and Leiser, 1982).

                         (18) 
where φ is the friction angle of the soil; i is the initial inclination of the reinforcement (root) with 
respect to the shear plane; m is shear distortion ratio (=x/z); x is the shear displacement; z is the 
thickness of the shear zone. Gray and Leiser (1982) indicated that the maximum shear strength 
increase provided by roots within the soil occurred at a root inclination (with respect to the shear plane) 
close to 45°+φ/2 rather than in a normal orientation with respect to the shear plane. For typical sands 
with φ value of 30°, the optimal root orientation is about 60° with respect to the shear plane based on 
the root reinforcement model. Gray and Leiser (1982) also conducted direct shear tests on reinforced 
sands, and the test results agree with that of the theoretical study. The researches conducted by Jewell 
and Wroth (1987) and by Gray and Leiser (1982) reach the same results on the optimal reinforcement 
(root) orientation, providing the maximum increase in the shearing resistance to the soil. Thus, the 
branching pattern of roots in a single root system undoubtedly affects the contribution of the root 
system to the shear strength increase of the soil. 
Roots of White Popinac (R-type root architecture) provide the greatest shear strength increase to the 
soil compared with other plant species tested in this research. The shear strength increase (∆S) is 
0.87tR if tR is evaluated based on the root strength crossing the shear plane. Oblique and near-vertical 
roots are well developed in the root structure of White Popinac. Theoretic and experimental studies 
described above show that roots inclined at about 60° with respect to the shear plane are the most 
efficient orientation in providing shearing resistance, i.e. oblique roots are more efficient in providing 
shearing resistance to the soil. Additionally, as described previously, the efficiency of the root system 
in terms of the shearing resistance can be identified by the percentage of the ratio of ∆S over tR based 
on the root strength of all roots in the root system with respect to that crossing the shear plane. The 
efficiency of the root system for White Popinac is 56% (as described in Section 3.3), and this value is 
superior compared with that of other plant species tested herein. Thus, the R-type root architecture is 
considered the most competent root structure in terms of the shear strength increase compared with 
other types of root architectures. 
The shear strength increase (∆S) provided by roots of Chinese tallow-tree (V-type root architecture) is 
about 0.688tR, which is about 79% of that of White Popinac, if tR is evaluated based on the root 
strength crossing the shear plane. Strong vertical roots in the V-type root structure play important role 
in providing the shearing resistance to the soil. The efficiency of the root system for Chinese 
tallow-tree is 47% in terms of the shear strength increase estimated by the root strength of the entire 
root system with respect to that crossing the shear plane, and this value is moderate to high among the 
plant species tested herein. The root structure of Chinese tallow-tree (V-type root architecture) is 
considered efficient in terms of the contribution of the shearing resistance to the soil, however, it is 
slightly less than that of White Popinac (R-type root architecture).  
The shear strength increases (∆S) provided by roots of Japanese Mallotus and Ironwood (VH-type root 
architecture) are 0.462tR and 0.3tR, respectively, if tR is evaluated based on the root strength crossing 
the shear plane, and they are about 53% and 34%, respectively, of that by White Popinac (R-type root 
architecture). The shear strength increase contributed by plant species with VH-type root structure is 
less than that with R-type and V-type root structures. Additionally, the efficiency of the root system 
for Japanese Mallotus and Ironwood is 34% and 57%, respectively, and these values are low to 
superior among the plant species tested herein. Although the shear strength increase provided by the 
root system of Ironwood is not as good as that of Japanese Mallotus, the efficiency of the root system 
for Ironwood is excellent compared with other plant species tested herein.

embankment. This hybrid reinforced earth embankment system can also be used in 
widening existing embankments, repairing collapsed mountain roadways, and other 
conditions with limited fill space. The key to properly design this hybrid reinforced 
earth embankment for a given loading condition is to determine the stress distribution 
to the reinforcements, connecting elements, and soil nails. The idea of the hybrid 
reinforced earth embankment is highly feasible in engineering practice and has been 
used in a few cases recently. However, there is no theory or methodology, e.g. limit 
equilibrium methods, so far to analyze this proposed system.   
This study aims to investigate the mechanical behavior of the embankment system 
using the finite element method and to develop design charts for soil nails. Static 
loadings were accounted for in the FE analyses. The influence of the reinforcement 
length and slope gradient of the embankment facing on the distribution of nail forces 
was also analyzed and discussed in this paper.

COMPONENTS OF THE HYBRID REINFORCED EARTH EMBANKMENT 
 
A series of connecting elements are used to incorporate reinforced earth 
embankments with soil nails, as shown in Figure 1(b). The connecting element, 
improved from a patented connecting method (Chou and Fan, 2004), consists of a 
series of stainless steel wire ropes and stainless steel pipes. Stainless steel wire ropes 
are used to connect soil nails with reinforcing materials by binding the nail head and 
the steel pipe. At least a pair of stainless steel wire rope clips are used to tie the 
stainless steel wire rope at both ends. Horizontal spacing for the connecting elements 
is typically 1 to 1.5m. 
 
NUMERICAL MODELING 
The finite element procedure was used to model the construction of the hybrid 
reinforced earth embankment system. The non-linear finite element program PLAXIS 
(PLAXIS BV, 2002), which can reasonably model the mechanical behavior of 
soil-nail interactions and reinforcing elements, was used to analyze the stress 
distribution of reinforcements and soil nails. Typical geometry of the hybrid 
reinforced earth embankment used in the numerical analyses is shown in Figure 2.

analysis (plane strain condition), nails were modeled using the “equivalent plate 
model” approach (Unterreiner et al, 1997) and elastic perfectly-plastic behavior. Table 
1 illustrates the properties of nails used in the analyses. 
Moreover, interfaces were placed on both sides of nails and reinforcing materials. 
The Mohr-Coulomb model was used to model the behavior of soil-nail interfaces. 
Material properties for the interface element are identical to those used for its 
surrounding soil element, except that a strength reduction coefficient (Rinter) was used 
to determine the strength parameters of the interface. The adhesion (cinter) and friction 
angle (tanφinter) of the interface are estimated as the ratio of csoil/Rinter and tanφinter/Rinter, 
respectively, where csoil and φsoil are the cohesion and friction angle of the soil, 
respectively, adjacent to the interface. A Rinter value of 1.0 is considered reasonable for 
the soil-nail interface (Chu and Yin, 2006). The Rinter value for the soil-reinforcement 
interface used in the analyses is 0.6, based on the experimental results by O’Rourke et 
al (1990).

MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF THE HYBRID REINFORCED EARTH 
EMBANKMENT 
To determine the required reinforcement length for a stable reinforced earth 
embankment, conventional methods, e.g. the limit equilibrium method, can be used. 
The computer program ReSSA (Adama Engineering Inc., 2001), based on the limit 
equilibrium method (Elias et al, 2001), was used to conduct this task. The required 
reinforcement length for a stable reinforced earth embankment can be analyzed to 
meet a desired factor of safety. For example, the required reinforcement length to 
reach a factor of safety of 1.5 in normal conditions is about 6.5m for a 9m-high 
embankment with a slope gradient of 80º and the backfill properties listed in Table 1. 
Thus, the 9m-high reinforced earth embankment with a reinforcement length of 4m 
needs additional resisting forces to meet the safety requirement.

DESIGN FOR THE HYBRID REINFORCED EARTH EMBANKMENT 
 
The maximum reinforcement stresses mobilized at various elevations of a 9m-high 
hybrid reinforced earth embankment with a slope gradient of 80° following the 
construction range from about 2.5kN/m to 11.5kN/m. The reinforcement stresses are 
considerably less than the tensile strength (Tult) of normally used reinforcing materials 
(geogrids), e.g. Tult≈150~250kN/m. Therefore, the stability of the hybrid reinforced 
earth embankment relies mainly on the understanding of the nail forces that may 
develop following the construction of the embankment and under static loading 
conditions. 
 Numerical analyses for the hybrid reinforced earth embankments with various 
slope gradients (β=60°~90°), various embankment heights (H=7~12m), and various 
reinforcement lengths (LR=3~9m) were carried out to investigate the distribution of 
nail forces developed following the construction and under 10kPa static loadings. The 
nail forces induced by normal traffic loading are less than those induced by a 10kPa 
static uniform loading (Fan and Hsieh, 2007). Therefore, the nail forces mobilized 
under a 10kPa static uniform loading are used to develop design charts for the hybrid 
reinforced earth embankment proposed. 
The nail forces mobilized at the back of the reinforced earth embankment with 
various geometric conditions in narrow fill space were obtained, and design charts for 
nail forces were summarized in this research. The design charts for soil nails were 
presented in terms of the normalized depth (z/H) vs. normalized nail force (T/γHSHSv), 
where H is the embankment height; T is the maximum nail force (developed at the nail 
head); γ is the unit weight of fill; SH and Sv are horizontal and vertical spacing of nails, 
respectively. To simplify the design procedure, stress envelopes for nail forces in the 
embankment with various fill geometries were established. Figure 7 shows nail force

The design charts established in this research were justified by the deformation of 
the hybrid reinforced earth embankment induced following the construction. Figure 8 
shows the comparison of the computed (FE analyses) maximum lateral displacement, 
occurring on the front facing, of the embankment following the construction with the 
empirical chart suggested by Elias et al(2001), a US FHWA report used for estimating 
the probable lateral displacement of normal reinforced earth structures that may occur 
during the construction. The comparison clearly indicates that the maximum lateral 
displacements of hybrid reinforced earth embankments with various geometric 
conditions computed using the FE analyses are all less than those estimated from the 
empirical curve suggested by Elias et al(2001). Therefore, the design charts 
established herein for estimating the nail forces in the hybrid reinforced earth 
embankment are considered adequate in terms of the mechanical behavior and the 
performance of the lateral displacement of the embankment. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
This paper presents the mechanical behavior of a hybrid reinforced earth 
embankment built in limited fill space. Soil nails are installed on back of the 
reinforced earth embankment to provide additional resisting forces to stabilize the 
embankment with limited fill space. Influence of the reinforcement length and slope 
gradient of the embankment on the distribution of nail forces was analyzed and 
discussed in this paper. 
The stability of the hybrid 
reinforced earth embankment 
during the construction and 
subjected to loading on the 
roadway relies mainly on the 
resistance that nails can provide. 
Simple design charts for estimating 
the nail forces mobilized within the 
hybrid reinforced earth 
embankment with various 
geometric conditions were 
established for fill materials with a 
friction angle of 30° in this 
research.
