三. 研究設備與方法 
3.1 模型廠與實驗設備 
本研究主要是利用A2/O程序進行
研究，模型廠示意圖如圖3.1所示。研
究模廠之生物反應單元由厭氧槽、缺
氧槽、好氧槽串聯所組成，其尺寸長、
寬、高分別為：1 m × 0.2 m × 0.2 
m ，總有效體積為 40 L。模廠主要是
以 PVC 材質製成，並用隔板分作3個
區域，厭氧槽、缺氧槽、好氧槽之比
例為 2 ： 2 ： 6 有效體積則為 8 L、 
8 L 與 24 L。 
另外在反應槽中之厭氧槽設置一
組均質攪拌設備，使厭氧槽中之懸浮

活性污泥膠羽的微環境，包括絲狀菌
單一方向生長的特性。模式需要部份
簡化以限制其在合理範圍。本研究擬
發展的活性污泥膠羽模式包括以下關
鍵元素： 
 
1. 程序模式 
模式考慮 6 種型態的細菌，包括：
異營性膠羽形成菌、低溶氧絲狀菌、
低 F/M 比絲狀菌、氨氮氧化菌及亞硝
酸氮氧化菌，模擬模式中並可計算基
質、溶氧及其他成分。模式採多基質
（DO、有機物及其他成分）  限制 
Monod 項以計算細菌生長及基質利
用。故現階段的模式中，粒狀基質、
水解、氮及磷型態的基質仍必須考
慮，衰減程序則以個別細胞的基準處
理（參考老化）。 
 
2. 擴散 
模式所模擬的污泥膠羽周長直接
與水體接觸，各項溶解性基質及溶氧
的擴散以 Fick’s law 計算，假設水體可
無限制地提供兩種基質。擴散係數依
據相關文獻值。因為膠羽內部孔隙結
構及胞外聚合物 (extracellular polymer) 
所引起的效應，各項溶解性基質及溶
氧在膠羽內部的典型值低於水體。動
態模擬中所使用的擴散係數，對基質 
(以葡萄糖為例) 而言為  0.1 ×  10-5 
cm2 sec，氧為 0.5 × 10-5 cm2 sec。此
程式亦可在沒有任何擴散限制的情況
下執行。 
 
3. 解析度 
模擬開始前，首先執行一些預備試
程，以決定維持程式執行所需的解析
度。既然細菌的典型尺寸為微米，1 mμ
的解析度似乎是比較好的開始。但
是，如果審視這個尺度的複雜度，可
發現一個平均直徑為 100 mμ 的膠
羽，可能會包含一百萬個狀態變數。
為了減化此問題，可採取兩個步驟。
第一，假設膠羽為三維對稱，如此一
來，只有一個二維的切面需要模擬；
第二，選擇 2 mμ × 2 mμ 的解析度進
行模擬。這樣形成 50 × 50 的方格，
在膠羽內共有 12500 個狀態變數。每
個格狀元素內包括溶解性基質及溶
氧，皆受到微生物攝取及擴散之控
制。另外，假設格狀元素不是空的，
就是只被任何一個型態的細菌所佔
據。 
 
4. 繁殖規則 
當細菌細胞的尺寸因為生長而達
到格狀元素的全部容量時，細菌細胞
會發生繁殖，細菌會損失 25 ％的質
量，並放置在鄰近的格狀元素中。在
膠羽形成菌方面，假設繁殖方向是隨
機的，而絲狀菌則＂記得＂第一個隨
機性導向的繁殖步驟，以進行高機率
性的後續細胞分化。另外，只有環繞
在細胞周圍的 8 個鄰近格狀元素是繁
殖細胞可以繁殖的方向。如果在一個
已被完全包圍的細胞發生分化，則新
一代（或稱為子代）的細胞，會藉由
將同一格線上細胞移動一個位置的方
式空出一格而予以取代。如果在膠羽
形成菌的周圍有一個空位置，則＂子
代＂將會佔據那個位置，結果是在模
擬過程中形成相當緊密的膠羽。所有
從一開始一直空著的方格都有細菌繁
殖，然後自膠羽的內部向外逐漸地增
加質量。

本研究取A2/O系統所馴養之污

微生物之觀察及拍攝，並將所拍攝之
微生物以Motic Images Plus 2.0影像分

將lnA繪於縱座標，橫座標以lnP來表

取A2/O系統所馴養之污泥，以相

觀察及拍攝，並將所拍攝之微生物以
Motic Images Plus 2.0影像分析軟體，
進行量測微生物之面積（A）由於膠羽
菌皆為不規則形狀，無法直接量測直
徑大小是否會隨SVI改變，所以，利用
影像分析軟體量測每一個面積，並假
設膠羽菌為圓形，在代入公式Deq＝2
√(S/π) ，即可得每一個膠羽菌之等
式直徑（equivalent diameter，Deq）。
其結果發現，相同SVI下Deq（68～132）
的數值並不相近，與Mauricio et al. 
( 2001) 相較，此學者以工業及都市廢
水所馴養的污泥進行研究，其在相同
SVI下數值所得Deq（44～103 µm）亦
相同。 
即Deq的大小不會與SVI的變動有
所變化，在SVI較低時亦有可能有較大
之Deq。此外，相同SVI下Deq的變化與
菌絲長度無直接影響，所以無法直接
分析SVI與Deq的關係，作為判斷系統
是否處於膨化狀態之依據。

果相比，其Df值分別為1.31及1.22。綜
合上述研究結果其Df值皆分佈在1≦Df

加3.0 mg L ml g-1。 
4. 量測微生物Deq之變動後發現，Deq
（68～132）的大小不會與SVI的變
動有所變化，在SVI較低時亦有可
能有較大之Deq。此外，相同SVI

5. 量測微生物Df之變動後發現，於膨

related to nitrogen removal. The behaviors of XAOB, XNOB,
XPAO, XH and two oxidized nitrogen (SNO2 and SNO3) in were not
considered simultaneously in these models. Since nitrogen
removal is one aim of BNR process, simulation of XAOB, XNOB
and oxidized nitrogen (SNO2 and SNO3) becomes important on
operation and management of BNR process.
In this study, we proposed an extended activated sludge
model that considered not only the kinetics and stoichiometry
of XAOB and XNOB but also the reduction of SNO2 and SNO3 . The
objectives of this study are listed as follows: (1) to establish an
extended mathematical model to describe the transformation of
different components including carbon, nitrogen and phos-
phorus in the A2O process, (2) to determine the kinetic
parameters of two nitrifying species using oxygen uptake rate
(OUR) batch tests, (3) to explore the consistency between
simulation and observed values of different soluble components
such as biodegradable substrate (SS), SNH4 , SNO2 , SNO3 and
orthophosphate (SPO4), and (4) to analyze the kinetics of
different microorganisms including XH, XPAO, XAOB and XNOB
in A2O process as returning supernatant varied.
2. Model development
The stoichiometric matrix and process equations of
extended model are presented in Tables 1–4, respectively.
The significant differences between this extended model and
other activated sludge models are described as follows.
2.1. Two-stage nitrification processes of XAOB and XNOB
Under aerobic condition, SNH4 may be oxidized to SNO2 by
XAOB, subsequently SNO2 may be oxidized to SNO3 by XNOB.
The two-stage nitrification reactions were described by two
equations (process 9 and 11 in Table 2) in the extended model.
2.2. Reduction of SNO2 and SNO3 related to XH
In ASM2d [1,2], it was assumed that SNO3 would be
transformed intomolecular nitrogen directly under anoxic condi-
tion. Two types of carbon sources were utilized for the reduction
of SNO3 , i.e., readily biodegradable substrate (SF) and fermenta-
tion products (SA). To describe these behaviors, two equations
wereadopted inASM2d. In fact,SNO3 maybe reduced toSNO2 and
subsequently tomolecular nitrogenbyXHunder anoxic condition
[16]. In the extended model, reduction of SNO2 and SNO3 using
different carbon sources (SF and SA) were considered. Totally,
four process equations (process 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Table 2) were
adopted to describe denitrification under anoxic condition.
2.3. Reduction of SNO2 and SNO3 related to XPAO
Literature reported that SNO2 also served as the electron
acceptors for XPAO under anoxic condition excepting SNO3 [17].
In extended model, we assumed that the contribution of XPAO
for reducing SNO2 and SNO3 depended on the ratios of SNO2 and
SNO3 to SNOX. So two dimensionless terms were introduced into
kinetic equations of XPAO for description of denitrification, i.e.,
SNO2=ðSNO2þSNO3Þ or SNO3=ðSNO2þSNO3Þ (process 18, 19, 21
and 22 in Table 2).
2.4. Numerical methods and computer program
The equations that described the reactions in the extended
model formed an ordinary differential equation system. We
coded a FORTRAN language computer program in which the
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method was adopted to simulate the
entire model.
3. Materials and methods
3.1. Pilot scale A2O process
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the A2O process. The effective volumes
of anaerobic, anoxic and oxide stage were 3, 3 and 9 L, respectively. To avoid
the effect of various temperatures on microbiological kinetics, the pilot scale
plant was installed and continuously operated in a laboratory with the tem-
perature controlled at 20 centigrade. The influent flowrate, ratios of return
sludge and sludge retention times (SRT) were 36 L day1, 0.25 and 13 days,
respectively. The system was operated under three different mixed liquid
recycling ratios (MLRR), including 0.5, 1.25 and 2.0, and maintained at steady
state. The dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were controlled in the ranges of 1.8–
2.0 and 7.0–7.2, respectively, in the aerobic tank.
3.2. Synthetic wastewater
The synthetic substratewas prepared with full-fat drymilk powder and other
reagents, as shown in Table 5. Then the synthesis substrate and distilled water
were mixed to prepare the synthesis wastewater. The analytical methods were
performed according to Standard Methods [18].
3.3. OUR batch tests
TheOURmeasuring system consisted of four airtight, circular chambers,with
sameheight and volume, fourmagnetic stirrers for stirring and an aeration stone in
each chamber [19]. DO was monitored by four oxygen meters of high stability
connected to a data acquisition system. Since this OURmeasurer was airtight, the
actual respiration rate of the tested biomass at any time during the batch-test did
not depend on oxygen input. Therefore the DO concentration represented the
actual OUR.A certain amount of activated sludge samplewas taken from the pilot
plants and added into OUR chambers. Distilled water containing organic carbon
source andnutrient includingglucose,NH4SO4 andKH2PO4were added resulting
in total volume of 800 mL in chamber. The measuring system was periodically
aerated, then the difference between the measured OUR and baseline oxygen
respiration was calculated and compared. In order to evaluate the kinetic para-
meters and active biomass of XH, XAOB and XNOB, different types of OUR values
should be considered: total OUR (OURT), OUR of XH (OURH), OUR of XAOB
(OURAOB) and OUR of XNOB (OURNOB). The determination of OURs of XH,
XAOB andXNOBwere based on the subsequent addition of allylthiourea (ATU) and
NaN3, selective inhibitors of XAOB and XNOB, to the activated sludge sample.
WhendeterminingOURT, no inhibitorwas added.WhendeterminingOURH, both
ATUandNaN3were added. If onlyNaN3was added, thedeterminedOURwas the
sum of OURH and OURAOB, then OURNOB = OURT  (OURH + OURAOB).
While OURAOB = (OURH + OURAOB)  OURH.
4. Results and discussion

concentrations of 17 components defined by the extended
model were investigated. Their values are shown in Table 6 and
used for model simulation.
4.2. Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity of effluent components for the following
parameters was analyzed based on a 10% change of the
standard values.
All stoichiometric (5 parameters) and kinetic parameters (52
parameters) of the extended model.
The component concentrations in the influent (16 para-
meters).
The influent flow, internal flow of sludge and mixed liquid (3
parameters).
The DO concentration in the aerobic zone (1 parameters).
The sensitivity (SEN) of the above parameters ( p) with
respect to y (being effluent components) was calculated by [20]:
SEN ¼ dy=y
d p= p
(1)
where dp is the change in the parameter value p, and dy the
change in the output y.
According to sensitivity analysis, the effluent concentra-
tions have different sensitivities towards different para-
meters. The effluent SS appeared to have a sensitivity of more
than 1 (SEN > 1) towards 3 parameters: mH, bH, YH. The
effluent SNH4 , SNO2 and SNO3 had a sensitivity of more than 1
towards 5 (influent SNH4 , mAOB, qpp, YAOB, YPO4), 8 (mAOB,
mNOB, mPAO, qpp, YH, YAOB, YNOB, YPO4), and 4 (influent
flowrate, mAOB, YH, YPO4) parameters, respectively. The
effluent SPO4 were most sensitive towards SPO4 , qPHA, qpp,
mPA0, KMAX, YH and YPO4 .
The internal concentrations (at the end of the anaerobic tank)
of SS, SNH4 , SNO2 , SNO3 and SPO4 were also sensitive for the
stoichiometric and kinetic parameters. Fifty nine kinetic
parameters gave a sensitivity of more than 1 with regard to
the internal concentrations.
The sensitivity of the effluent SA, SNH4 , SNO2 , SNO3 and SPO4
concentrations for the DO concentrations in the aerobic tank
was more than 1.
4.3. Model calibration
There are many parameters in the model. For those
parameters that are known to be approximately constant in
domestic wastewater, the default values from previous
studies [1–2] were used as shown in Tables 3 and 4.
According to the sensitivity analysis, the more sensitive
parameters were estimated from batch experiments. The
procedures were fully or partially adopted from previous
studies [21–23]. In order to determine the kinetic parameters
of XAOB and XNOB, we determined OURT, OURH, OURAOB
and OURNOB and substituted them into equations for
calculation [19].

concentration in the aerobic effluent due to nitrification.
According to the simulation and test values, when MLRR
increased, the effluent SNO3 would decrease.
The phosphate concentrations, SPO4 , increased in the
anaerobic effluent due to release of phosphate and decreased
in the latter anoxic and oxic effluent, as shown in Fig. 2(e). It
showed a good fitness between simulation and experimental
results (R2 = 0.95). The variations of SPO4 in the effluent were
not significant when MLRR varied.
4.5. Reaction pathways
The success of modeling the variation of SNO2 and SNO3 was
resulted from some extended kinetics in the model. The
reactions of different components in extended model formed
complicated pathway (Fig. 3) which were different from
ASM2d [2].
In the extended model, we introduced the pathway in which
SNH4 was oxidized to SNO2 by XAOB and SNO2 was oxidized to
SNO3 by XNOB subsequently under aerobic condition, as shown
in Fig. 3(a). This two-stage nitrification pathway in extended
model may be described by

According to previous studies, mAOB values of 0.8, 2.2, 1.31,
1.36 and 1.368 day1 were reported by Kappeler and Brod-
mann [10], Nowak et al. [11], Wijffels et al. [24], Tartakovsky
et al. [25] and Pe´rez et al. [26], respectively. ThemNOB values of
1.2, 2.5, 0.864 and 0.864 day1 were reported by Kappeler and
Brodmann [10], Nowak et al. [11], Tartakovsky et al. [25] and
Pe´rez et al. [26]. In this study, mAOB and mNOB were 0.8 and
0.4 day1, respectively. The mAOB in this study was analogous
to the value reported by Kappeler and Brodmann [10]. The
value of mNOB lay between the reported values. YAOB values
reported by Tartakovsky et al. [25] and Marsili-Libelli and
Tabani [15] were 0.12 and 0.21, respectively. Its value was 0.18
in this study. YNOB values reported by Tartakovsky et al. [25]
and Marsili-Libelli and Tabani [15] were 0.04 and 0.03,
respectively. It was 0.06 in this study.
In the extended model, we took into account the pathway in
which SNO3 was reduced to SNO2 and subsequently to molecular
nitrogen by XH under anoxic condition (Fig. 3(b)). Two types of
carbon sources (SF and SA) for reducing SNO2 and SNO2 were
modeled separately and total 4 process equations were
considered (process 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Table 2). The observed
growth rate of XH in anoxic tank was always smaller than that in
aerobic tank. The reduction factors for anoxic condition were
introduced to describe the phenomenon. The reduction factors
when XH utilizing SNO2 (hNO2H) and SNO3 (hNO3H) were 1.0 and
0.8 reported by Kappeler and Brodmann [10]. In this study,
hNO2H of 1.0 and hNO3H of 0.8 were chosen, respectively.
The pathway that SNO2 served as the electron acceptors of
XPAO under anoxic condition was considered in our extended
model as shown in Fig. 3(c). Two dimensionless terms were
introduced into kinetic equations of XPAO for description of
denitrification, i.e., SNO2=ðSNO2þSNO3Þ or SNO3=ðSNO2þSNO3Þ
(process 18, 19, 21 and 22 in Table 2).

Abstract In this study, sewage quality variations were investigated and the active fractions of 
different microbial function groups in biofilm were quantified in a 5.6 km trunk sewer. The 
results indicated that the growth rate constant of heterotrophic organisms lay between 5.6 and 
11.3 d-1. Its average value was 8.4 d-1. The lysis rate constant of heterotrophic organisms lay 
between 0.2 and 0.5 d-1. XH fraction in biofilm varied from 300 to 680 mg COD m-2, average 
values was 413 mg COD m-2. The TSS values which represented the biofilm mass varied 
from 880 to 1080 mg COD m-2. The percentage of XH to biofilm mass fell within the range of 
30.0 % and 77.3 %, average value was 43.1 %. The growth rate constant and lysis rate 
constant of XAUT could not be determined because the fraction of XAUT in biofilm was relatively 
few. In addition, sewage quality including suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, 
total chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite 
nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were measured and compared with the values in literatures. It 
revealed that the degradation of organic matters, nitrification and denitrification occurred in 
the trunk sewer.

INTRODUCTION 
Sewer pipe is a facility for transporting sewage from the source to the wastewater treatment 
plant (WWTP). Because the sewer systems receive a large amount of sewage from either 
industrial effluents or households with high concentrations and various compounds, the mass 
transports in sewer become more important. 
Sewage quality in sewer systems changed due to microbial processes during transportation. 
The transformation of soluble and particulate compounds generally occurred in the bulk 
water, biofilm and sediment. The sewage quality changes took place under aerobic as well as 
anaerobic conditions determined by the oxygen concentrations. These microbial changes in 
wastewater substrate as well as in biomass in the sewer have been investigated and 
quantified in many previous studies (Cao and Alaerts, 1996; Tanaka and Hvitved-Jacobsen, 
1998; Hvitved-Jacobsen et al., 1998a; 1998b; 2000; Flamink et al., 2005). 
The interactions between the biofilm and the nitrogen compounds are very complicated due 
to the various kinds of compounds and water flow conditions in sewers. In sewers, many

between the measured OUR and baseline oxygen respiration was calculated and compared.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Quantification of microbial functional groups 
Table 1 shows the experimental and calculated values in OUR batch tests. The growth rate 
constant of heterotrophic organisms, Hμ  lay between 5.6 and 11.3 d-1. Its average value 
was 8.4 d-1. According to previous studies, the Hμ  values of 3.0, 5.0, 3.25, 5.0, 6.7 and 3.25 
d-1 were reported by Cao and Alaerts (1996), Tanaka and Hvitved-Jacobsen (1998), Hvitved-
Jacobsen et al. (1998a), Hvitved-Jacobsen et al. (1998b), Hvitved-Jacobsen et al. (2000) and 
Flamink et al. (2005), respectively. The values of Hμ  obtained in this study were greater 
than those in literatures. Since the biofilm was shaved and broken into suspended type and 
glucose was used as carbon source in OUR batch test, the activity of some XH was higher 
than those in sewer. The lysis rate constant of heterotrophic organisms, bH, lay between 0.2 
and 0.5 d-1. 
In this study, XH fraction in biofilm varied from 300 to 680 mg COD m-2, average values was 
413 mg COD m-2.The XH values of 10 g COD m-2 used by Hvitved-Jacobsen et al. (2000) for 
model simulation in biofilm was much higher than the values obtained in our study.

nitrogen ranged from 0.48 to 1.16 mg L-1. Æsøy et al. (1997) observed the NO3--N 
concentrations ranged from 0.3-1.3 mg L-1. Arthur and Delgado et al. (1998) studied the 
effect of DO in wastewater transformation during transportation. The concentrations of 
nitrate varied from 0.4 to 0.5 mg L-1 and nitrite varied from 0.3 to 0.4 mg L-1 during 
transportation. They also found that nitrification and denitrification rates ranged from 0.03 to 
0.42 g (NO3--N + NO2--N) m-2 hr-1 and 0.009 to 0.032 g NO3--N m-2 hr-1. The concentrations 
of NO2--N were close to the values proposed by Arthur and Delgado et al. (1998), from 0.3 to 
0.4 mg L-1. The values of NO3--N obtained in our study were much higher than those 
concentrations in literatures (Butler et al., 1995; Arthur and Delgado et al., 1998). 
The values of NH3-N in our study were much lower than those proposed in the literatures 
(Butler et al., 1995; Jimenez and Landa, 1998; Seidl et al., 1998; Delgado et al., 1998; 
Ashley, 1998), while the values of NO3--N in our study were much higher than those 
obtained in the literatures (Butler et al., 1995; Arthur and Delgado et al., 1998). The value of 
TN investigated in our study was close to the average concentration in the literature. It 
implied that nitrification had occurred in the secondary sewer, lateral, and branches before 
the sewage entered the trunk sewer. Although XAUT fraction was too few to be determined in 
the OUR batch test, there still existed XAUT in the sewer biofilm. 
CONCLUSIONS 
In this study, sewage quality variations were investigated and the active fractions of different 
microbial function groups in biofilm were quantified in a 5.6 km trunk sewer. 
The results indicated that the values of Hμ  lay between 5.6 and 11.3 d-1. Its average value 
was 8.4 d-1. The values of bH lay between 0.2 and 0.5 d-1. XH fraction in biofilm varied from 
300 to 680 mg COD m-2, average values was 413 mg COD m-2. The TSS values which 
represented the biofilm mass varied from 880 to 1080 mg COD m-2. The percentage of XH to 
biofilm mass fell within the range of 30.0 % and 77.3 %, average value was 43.1 %. In the 
OUR batch tests, the biomass, growth rate constant and lysis rate constant of XAUT could not 
be determined because the fraction of XAUT in biofilm was relatively few. 
The pH and temperature values fell within the range of 6.2-7.4 and 24-27.1 centigrade, 
respectively. They both increased as distance increased. The DO showed the highest range of 
6-8 mg L-1 at 0.7 km (location 1), subsequently decreased to the range of 3-5 mg L-1 at 2.0 
km, and finally maintained at the range of 4–6 mg L-1. 
SS was low at 0.7 km, only 2.4–5.6 mg L-1. Then SS peaked at 2.8 km and 4.8 km, fell in the 
range of 17.1 and 38.8 mg L-1. BOD lay between 7.2 and 34.8 mg L-1. TCOD varied between 
18.0 and 78.0 mg L-1.  
The variations of nitrogen compound were described as follows. TN: 4.1-36.5 mg L-1, TKN: 
0.9-21.1 mg L-1, NH3-N: 0.4-11.1 mg L-1, NO2--N: 0.03-0.17 mg L-1, NO3--N: 3.0-25.3 mg L-
1. 
It revealed that the degradation of organic matters, nitrification and denitrification occurred 
in the trunk sewer.

Introduction
Results & Discussion
zThe interactions between the biofilm and the nitrogen compounds are very complicated due to the various kinds of compounds and water flow conditions in sewers. In 
sewers, many species of microbes involve in degradation of various compounds. The organic matters will be utilized by heterotrophic bacteria under either aerobic or 
anoxic conditions. If oxygen is sufficient, nitrification and denitrification by which ammonia is converted first to nitrite, nitrate and then to nitrogen gas will occur.
zAlthough the transportation and transformation of sewage in sewer system are complicated, well understanding on variations of sewage will result in good operation 
of treatment plants and maintenance of sewer pipes. So, the variations of these compounds and amount of different microbial function groups in the sewer systems are 
an important, worthwhile topic. So the objectives of this study are listed as follows. (1) To investigate sewage quality variation in a 5.6 km trunk sewer. (2) To quantify 
the active fractions of different microbial function groups including heterotrophs and autrotrophs in the sewer biofilm using an oxygen uptake rate (OUR) test. (3) To 
analyze the interactions between sewage variations and different microbial functional groups. 
Conclusions
Quantification of microbial functional groups
zTable 1 shows the experimental and calculated values in OUR batch tests. 
The growth rate constant of heterotrophic organisms,  lay between 5.6 and 
11.3 d-1. Its average value was 8.4 d-1.Since the biofilm was shaved and 
broken into suspended type and glucose was used as carbon source in OUR 
batch test, the activity of some XH was higher than those in sewer. The lysis
rate constant of heterotrophic organisms, bH, lay between 0.2 and 0.5 d-1.
zIn this study, XH fraction in biofilm varied from 300 to 680 mg COD m-2, 
average values was 413 mg COD 
zThe shaved biofilm was also used to determine total suspended solids 
(TSS). The TSS represented the biofilm mass and its value varied from 880 to 
1080 mg COD m-2. Æsøy et al. (1997) found that average amount of biomass 
in the anoxic and septic sewers ranged from 3-60 g VS m-2.
zThe percentage of XH to biofilm mass in this work fell within the range of 
30.0 % and 43.5 %, except for that of location 2 (at 1.4 km). The average 
value was 43.1 %. In the OUR batch tests, the biomass, growth rate constant 
and lysis rate constant of XAUT could not be determined because the fraction 
of XAUT in biofilm was relatively few. But nitrification was still observed 
according to the investigation of sewage quality in the trunk sewer.

BOD lay between 7.2 and 34.8 mg L-1. The average BOD value at 1.4 km (location 2) 
peaked at the highest value of 21.9 mg L-1, it could explain why the percentage of XH
was the highest value of 77.3 % at this location. The average BOD was lower at 5.1 
km compared to other locations, except for that of location 1 (0.7 km). It suggested 
that biodegradation of organic matters occurred along the trunk sewer.
TCOD varied between 18.0 and 78.0 mg L-1, it peaked at 5.1 km (location 6). 
Nitrogen compounds
zTN
TN concentrations fell in the range of 4.1 and 36.5 mg L-1 and reached an average 
peak value of 29.0 mg L-1 at 2.0 km. 
zTKN
The trend that TKN concentrations increased with the distance was obvious, as shown 
in Figure (h). TKN concentrations ranged from 0.9 to 21.1 mg L-1. 
zNH3-N 
The variation of NH3-N showed an increasing trend (Figure 2 (i)).The concentrations 
of NH3-N fell between 0.4 and 11.1 mg L-1.
zNO3--N and NO2--N
The NO2--N revealed relatively low concentrations varied from 0.03 to 0.17 mg L-1. 
In sewers, two species of autotrophic bacteria are capable of oxidizing ammonia to 
nitrite and subsequently to nitrate under aerobic condition. 
The concentrations of NO3--N ranged from 3.0 to 25.3 mg L-1. The values peaked at 
two locations including 1.4 km and 2.8 km.. 
The values of NH3-N in our study were much lower than those proposed in the 
literatures (Butler et al., 1995; Jimenez and Landa, 1998; Seidl et al., 1998; Delgado 
et al., 1998; Ashley, 1998), while the values of NO3--N in our study were much 
higher than those obtained in the literatures (Butler et al., 1995; Arthur and Delgado et 
al., 1998). The value of TN investigated in our study was close to the average 
concentration in the literature. It implied that nitrification had occurred in the 
secondary sewer, lateral, and branches before the sewage entered the trunk sewer. 
Although XAUT fraction was too few to be determined in the OUR batch test, there 
still existed XAUT in the sewer biofilm.
On behalf of the Government ofChina, I would like to extend awarm invitation to our friends
in the global water industry to come to
Beijing in 2006 for the 5th IWA World
Water Congress and Exhibition.
I believe that the 2006 IWA World Water
Congress will significantly contribute to
global sustainable development, with water professionals and
experts from all over the world coming together in Beijing to
exchange new ideas, knowledge and experiences and to discuss
how to promote the sustainable utilisation of water resources
through the innovative use of technology and management.
China has achieved tremendous economic growth in the past twenty
years. However, water shortages and pollution have become an
urgent challenge to further economic growth and urbanisation. The
solution to Chinese water problems will not only be significant to the
sustainable development of China but will also set a successful
example to the world. China hopes to exchange the fruits and
experiences of water technologies and management with other
countries.
The 2006 IWA World Water Congress will connect the world to the
Chinese water industry, helping delegates to understand the
Chinese market and culture, sharing experiences, and facilitating
future communication and co-operation.
Dear friends,
You are welcomed by Chinese colleagues, to share your ideas,
interests and insights.
You are welcomed by the Chinese market, to share a more open,
competitive and regulated water industry.
You are welcomed by the Chinese people and by Beijing, the capital
city, to share our splendid civilisation and life.
Qiu Baoxing, Congress President 
Vice-Minister of Construction, P.R. China
The International WaterAssociation is more than just anetwork of experts; it is a global
family of water professionals. It is
doubtful that there is any aspect of water
management not dealt with in-depth by
our members, scientists, practitioners,
engineers, regulators, utility
representatives and others. We operate
internationally, with representatives from the vast majority of nations
as our members, spécialistes sans frontières!
IWA convenes its World Water Congress and Exhibition every second
year. This provides an unrivalled opportunity for our members and all
others with an interest in the water industry to exchange ideas, learn
and network with peers within and outside their immediate
disciplines.  The presentation of a Congress paper or poster
contributes to the international dialogue on water management by
showcasing valuable work carried out in research or practice, and
enhances the international standing of those presenting.
This Call for Proposals sets out the thematic tracks and topics for
which IWA is soliciting papers for its 2006 Congress in Beijing,
China. (Authors may submit a paper for presentation and publication
in IWA’s highly cited professional journals; for oral presentation or as
a poster.) Ideas for workshops, which are always a feature of IWA’s
Congresses, and which encourage in-depth debate about
challenging issues, are also welcome.  Beijing will provide unique
cultural and professional experiences for all those who attend,
building on the outcomes and thinking of the 2002 Melbourne and
the 2004 Marrakech Congresses.
The quality of IWA’s Congress programmes is high and continues to
improve.  The review process is rigorous and the competition is
significant. By capturing the best of scientific thinking and practical
application, the IWA Congresses help to make a genuine and long-
lasting contribution to the myriad short- and long-term water
management issues that confront us all, locally and globally.  
I urge you to take advantage of this unique opportunity and
encourage your contribution.
I look forward to welcoming you all in Beijing.

Submission of proposal for a Workshop
The aim of workshops is to facilitate discussion of specific topics.
They differ from normal Congress sessions in that they will
encourage more dialogue between presenters, and between
presenters and delegates. 
The Programme Committee seeks proposals for subject areas that
are new, complex, rapidly evolving, potentially controversial,
interdisciplinary, or in other circumstances in which the panel
discussion better contributes to the knowledge conveyed in the
session. Joint Workshops of several IWA Specialist Groups are
especially welcome.
Workshop proposals should be submitted via the Congress website
(www.iwa2006beijing.com) by completing an online proposal form.
The proposal form will ask for a summary of the workshop outlining
its objectives and scope, the participants (detailing speakers and
the expected audience) and any expected outcomes. Detailed
guidelines to help you prepare and submit your proposal are
available on the website. All workshop proposals should be
submitted by 31 October 2005.
Individuals who submit outline papers, manuscripts or workshop
proposals will be notified of the outcome of the review process for
Congress presentations and publication in March 2006.
Terms and Conditions
By submitting a paper or a workshop proposal you will be identified
as the corresponding author and will be the first point of contact
for all communication regarding your submission and responsible
for any further communication with any co-authors of the
submission.
All proposals should be written in English.
Submissions must report original work or findings which have not
been previously published. Submissions that have a commercial
interest, or are merely outlines of intent or submissions that do not
conform to the guidelines will not be entered into the review
process.
The programme committee makes the final decision on the
selection of presentations at the Congress. This is also the case for
the programme of the Congress.
The editorial board of Water Science and Technology will make the
final decision on subsequent publication in the refereed IWA
journals.
At least one author of each selected paper and poster must register
and attend the conference to present the paper. Authors must
meet their own expenses to attend the Congress, including the
registration fee. If registration of and payment for the author
presenting the paper is not received by 4 May 2006, the paper will
be removed from the Congress schedule and replaced with an
alternative. There will be no exceptions to this rule.
