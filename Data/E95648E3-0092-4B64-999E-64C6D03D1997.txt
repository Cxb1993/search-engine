中文摘要 
人本通訊網路是將人與人之關係錯綜複雜的關係或互相影響之行為轉換成具體的圖形
鏈結。人本通訊是一個新穎且正在崛起之科技，從中延伸出無論是在網際網路或行動通訊上
許多的應用受到目前許多消費者及廠商的關注。本計畫「人本通訊與網路之研究」中，我們
主要將研究重心放在五項人本通訊網路的重要議題上，分別是： 
 
 (子計畫一) 具備即時性與區域性行動感測網路之人本計算加值應用服務之研究 
 (子計畫二) 人本通訊網路下之廣播與群播之關鍵技術研究 
 (子計畫三) 人本通訊與社會網路之賽局理論分析與合作激勵機制設計 
 (子計畫四) 位置覺察無線社群網路之應用及技術研究 
 (子計畫五) 人本通訊網路及社群網路之動態信息研究 
 
在子計畫一中，我們探討了即時性與區域性行動感測網路 (Mobile Sensor Networks, 
MSNs) 之人本計畫加值平台之服務，考量不同使用者個人資訊間的關聯性(例如信任關係或
距離關係)及使用者周遭的環境資訊(例如交通狀況或使用者生理資訊，該環境資訊是透過行
動感測網路之感測器蒐集) ，我們建立一人本計算加值服務平台，包含一信任運算引擎(Trust 
Computing Engine, TCE)，基於一信任模型(Trust Model)之下，用以計算不同使用者間的信任
關係；及一即時資料收集元件(Real-time Data Collector, RDC)，用以收集以人為中心的即時
性與區域性資料。 
 
在子計畫二中，我們提出一人本通訊網路的系統網路模型，以三層系統網路架構，描述
並建構人與人之間的友好及互動關係、社會群體網路以及無線通訊網路。基於所提出的網路
模型，本計畫進一步提出四種協助式用戶辨識演算法，在有限的時間以及預算限制下，藉由
協助式用戶的幫助下，將資訊傳播率達到最大化。 
 
在子計畫三中，我們利用線上社交網路的網路組成分析，來探討過載的資訊量對使用者
的行為影響。我們考慮以下兩種研究模型：邀請成為朋友的行為需要/不需要付出成本。我
們發現到當使用者是較冷漠短視(不願主動與人交友)，而且主動結交朋友需要付出成本時，
一個蓬勃的線上社交往網路幾乎無法形成與成長。

Abstract 
Human Centric Communication (HCC) treats complex human relationships and interactions 
as connections to form a network. HCC is an emerging technology in Internet and mobile 
communication. Applications of HCC are of highly interest to consumers and enterprises. In this 
integrated project, we focus on five important topics in human centric communication networks, 
which are included in the following five subprojects: 
 
 (Subproject 1) A study for Human Centric Computing Value-Added Applications on 
Real-time and Region-based Mobile Sensor Networks 
 (Subproject 2) Multicast and Broadcast for Human Centric Communication Networks 
 (Subproject 3) Theoretic Analysis and Cooperation Incentive Mechanism Design for 
Human-Centric Communication and Social Networking 
 (Subproject 4) Location-aware wireless social networking: applications and technologies 
 (Subproject 5) Information Dynamics of Human-Centric Communication and Social 
Networking 
 
In subproject 1, we design and implement a platform for the Human-Centric Computing 
(HCC) value-added applications on the real-time and region-based Mobile Sensor Networks 
(MSNs). We consider the relationships (e.g., trust and distance) between different user profiles and 
the environmental information around the user (e.g., city traffic, bio-data on body) for each user. 
We propose a platform that is divided into two major components: Trust Computing Engine (TCE) 
that calculates the “trust” relationship between different users based on a proposed trust model; 
and Real-time Data Collector (RDC) that obtains the human-centric real-time/region-based 
information. The TCE takes the sensed data from the RDC as inputs to update the trust. 
relationship between users.

Take devices as nodes and communications between two devices as edge, one can construct a 
human centric communication network (HCCN). In HCCN, devices as small as cups or pens can 
do communication, some important issues raise as the working items and research goals 
summarized in the proposal: 
1) To explore important issues and facilitate HCCN such as level execution and energy 
efficiency; 
2) To control HCCN such as broadcast/multicast and (game-based) information dynamics; 
3) To construct a network model for HCCN such as cooperation and information access 
4) To develop applications and services on top HCCN such as social networking services and 
value-added mobile services; and  
5) To understand human behaviors and intelligent in HCCN and social networks such as 
trust/reputation.  
I.1 Review of this project 
In this section we give a brief summary on motivations of this project. The project of HCCN 
is motivated due to the vast utilization of Internet and mobile communications (i.e. mobile Internet) 
and wide deployment of (mobile) Internet and applications/services that make a dream of 
“information society” gradually come true. However, information transportation in (mobile) 
Internet based information society is fundamentally different from packet transportation 
device-based over today’s data network. We can observe some fundamental differences from 
network science and thus we introduce the idea of HCCN that includes: 
(i) Nodes in data networks are now users or individuals (or agents in mathematical modeling) 
(ii) Nodes in data networks are device-based with an IP address associated. However, users may 
not have unique identity and may be anonymous.  
(iii) Packets are transported in data networks but messages are transported among users (Note: 
message here does not refer to an exact message consisting of a number of packets as the 
definition in data networks) 
12 
 
4. The subproject 4 tackles problems of location-aware HCCN, localization, energy aware 
location updates, information access control and maintenance of social groups; 
5. The subproject 5 tackles problems of behaviors and decision in HCCN, cooperation of 
cognition from learning in social networks, fundamental theoretical structure of information 
dynamics in HCCN, statistical control of information propagation in HCCN, applications to 
social networks or economical networks, network topology of HCCN based on general mobile 
Internet and development and implementation of search algorithms in HCCN.

Corresponding to the 4-layer structure of HCCN, we have 5 categories of missions in this 
pioneer exploration project, while the following table summarizes the efforts from each 
sub-project and thus the relationship among all sub-projects. Please note task category “network

started this project, and whose corresponding description has been published in the IEEE 
VTC2010-Spring Conference), we propose the analytical model and conduct simulation 
experiments to investigate the performance of our proposed mechanism. The analysis results 
are under preparation (in the journal version) for publication in IEEE journals. 
(2) We designed and implemented the prototyping of the RDC. We have submitted the description 
of this part to the Computer Communications journal for publication. 
 
We had complete survey for the trust model for the large-scale social network. We designed 
and implemented the prototyping of the “Fun Pull” platform (including a user-friendly GUI). The 
Fun Pull platform have won both of the Industrial Award and the Excellent Award in the 2010 
MobileHeroes competition held by the Industrial Development Bureau, where there are totally 82 
participating teams, and 15 teams enter the final. The Fun Pull platform is the only project 
winning two awards. 
I.2.2 Multicast and Broadcast for Human Centric Communication Networks 
A conceptual model for a human centric communication network is provided and a 
three-layer network architecture is presented to model the relationship among users, their social 
groups, and the serving radio access networks. The valued affiliation network model was adopted 
to mimic the non-isotropic relationship and grouping phenomenon among users in social layer and 
communication layer. Based on the proposed model, four helping-user identification algorithms 
were proposed to maximize the influence rate under the given time and budget constraints. 
Simulation results showed the effectiveness of four algorithms in different application scenarios. 
I.2.3 Theoretic Analysis and Cooperation Incentive Mechanism Design 
In a research perspective, we designed a simple but persuasive model and has proved the 
following two things: 1) Everyone has a difference desire of knowing information and different 
ability to process information, and to some extend this determines his or her social role; and 2)

aforementioned location-based SNSs is the precision of user location. In general, the precision of 
localization using GSM base stations could be around 100 meters while using GPS varies between 
20 and 30 meters. Assume user 1 left a message at the coffee shop as shown in Fig. 2 below.  
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Maximum localization errors in mobile SNS 
 
Due to imperfect localization, the information embedded in the message contains the 
coordinates of point A. If user 2 finds himself at a music store, he may later on receive the 
message (left at the location that is R meter away from point A) since the SNS may mistakenly 
conclude that user 2 is at point A, again due to imperfect localization. In other words, the example 
shows the maximum error could be up to twice of the precision of the localization technique, or 60 
meters in the case of GPS. In urban environments, our experiments suggest that the error could be 
easily up to several hundreds of meters or more. 
I.2.5 Information Dynamics of Human-Centric Communication and Social Networking 
Information dissemination has become one of the most important services of communication 
networks such as HCCN. In this project, a novel framework, segregating between useful and 
malicious types of information is introduced, in order to better understand information 
dissemination and dynamics in HCCN, and allowing to take into account special network features 
in information dynamics. According to the proposed framework, and inspired from epidemiology, 
we investigate the information dynamics in popular types of HCCN through the use of the

在第一年計畫中，我們設計考量即時資料收集元件運作壽命之即時性與區域性行動感測
網路省電回傳機制，此機制讓感測器能夠在省電的限制下回傳有效的資料。我們設計並實作
了 RDC元件的系統雛型。我們針對信任運算引擎進行了完整的文獻探討，並且實作了人本
計算加值服務平台的雛形。 
II.2 Energy Efficient Reporting Mechanism  
(1) 考量即時資料收集元件運作壽命之即時性與區域性行動感測網路省電回傳機制 
 Fig. 4. 行動感測網路架構圖 
 
如 Fig. 4所示，在行動感測網路中，監控區域 (Monitoring Area) 被劃分為數個 Sensing 
Regions (SRs)。在每個 SR 中，其感測資料 (例如，空氣汙染數值) 在一段時間內皆相同。
每個Mobile Sensor (MS) 裝置數個 Sensing Modules (SMs) 和一個 Reporting Module (RM) 
且都配備有 Global Positioning System (GPS)，能夠知道MS所處的位置資訊。SM負責監控
和收集感測資料，然後產生感測報告 (包含感測資料、時間和位置資訊)。RM負責將收集到
的感測報告傳送回 Sink節點。如圖三所示，MS有兩種運作模式：Active模式和 Sleep模式。
在 Active模式下，MS會開啟 SM和 RM。當 SM產生一個感測報告後，會將感測報告放置
在 Buffer中，RM會從 Buffer取出感測報告並且利用 IEEE 802.11協定開始傳輸該感測報告
22 
 
Sink節點並未收到任何有效的感測報告，此MP即為中斷的MP (interruption MP)，二
元變數 Ij(i)的定義如下 
5. 在每一段 MP 結束時，Sink 節點會計算比例 Γj(i)來代表 SRj的監控狀況。其定義
如下 
其中 Γj(0)=0。每 K段 MPs，這個比例 Γj(i)的資訊會廣播給處在 SRj的 MSs，讓MSs
能夠進一步的利用此資料來調整其 Sleep週期的長短。在每次的廣播後，Γj(0)的數值
會重設為 0。 
我們定義以下兩個事件。 
 事件 E1：Sink節點收到一個對於 SRj的感測報告。 
 事件 E2：計時器 Tp,j逾時。 
Sink部分的運作細節如下： 
第一步驟：當監控開始，Index i設為 1，代表第一段MP開始。 
第二步驟：計數器 CRv,j設定為 0。計時器 Tp,j設定為 θ。 
第三步驟：Sink 節點等待事件一或事件二的發生。當事件一發生，Sink 節點執行第
四步驟。當事件二發生，Sink節點執行第五步驟。 
第四步驟：Sink節點檢查接收到的感測報告是否為有效的。如果感測報告是有效的，
Sink節點更新 Dj數值，然後計數器 CRv,j的數值加 1。否則 (接收到的感測報告是無
效的)，Sink節點丟棄這個報告，並且回到第三步驟。 
第五步驟：Sink節點檢查計數器 CRv,j。如果 CRv,j＝0，二元變數 Ij(i)設定為 1。否則
二元變數 Ij(i)設定為 0。隨後 Sink節點計算出比例 Γj(i)。若 i mod K = 0，Sink節點
廣播一個通知的訊息給 SRj的MSs，其中包含 SRj的圓心 Cj，半徑 Δ和比例 Γj(i)。接
著，Sink節點將比例 Γj(i)重設為 0，並且回到第二步驟。 
b) MS部分 
當MS剛開始運作，MS停留在 Active模式，並且利用 IEEE 802.11協定來傳輸所收
集到的感測報告。同時，MS也聆聽 Sink節點所送出的通知訊息，來動態調整 Sleep
的週期。當MS收到一個 SRj的通知訊息，他會利用訊息中所挾帶的資訊 (即圓心 Cj，
半徑 Δ和比例 Γj(i))，來判斷自己是否處在 SRj中。如果 MS與圓心 Cj的距離小於半
24 
 
我們也提供了 Navigation Service，讓使用者能夠透過我們的系統，選擇空氣汙染較低的道路
行駛。 
 Fig. 6.Sink部分軟體架構 
 
MS部分的軟體實作在Windows NT/Mobile作業系統的.NET Framework上。其軟體架構
包含 Connection元件，Report Management元件和 Sleeping Scheduler。Sleeping Scheduler負
責感測器的睡眠周期控管，即實作前一小節所述的 Ts計時器與 BDSA 和 TDSA 演算法。
Connection 元件負責建立各種傳輸的連線，如 TCP/IP，GPS 和 SMS。Report Management
元件負責將感測報告的資料轉換成統一的格式。在本展示中，感測報告包含 CO2 (64-bit 浮
點數)，時間資訊(64-bit整數)，經度和緯度(兩個 64-bit浮點數)。

點時，他必須透過鄰居節點或是鄰居的鄰居節點…等，來推算他與這個目標節點的推算
信任度。Fig. 8 顯示著信任模型的系統流程 [3]。我們會根據自己本身所有的經驗、鄰居
節點的經驗和時間等參數，來決定出對這個成員的信任度。然後根據不同的事件來給予
不同的反應。 
信任模型的運算，根據不同的運用情境，而會使用不同的演算法，讓信任的意義更貼近
應用。在Choi的著作 [4] 中，說明信任模型的建置最好考量到現實的情況，並且盡可能
的模擬現實狀況世界中人們之間的信任關係。以下介紹一個在根據現實社會情況，而設
計出的信任模型。通常訊息在傳遞的過程中，會產生幾個問題：1) 傳遞的訊息被誤解，
造成以訛傳訛的現象；2) 傳遞的訊息被傳遞者加入了個人意思或者刻意誤導；3) 個人
觀感的不同，造成多種的解讀結果 。這幾個問題我們稱之為訊息的偏差。可以很直覺的
知道，世界上沒有兩個人是抱持著完全一樣的觀點，縱使兩個人是極度的相似。為此，
文獻 [5] 所提出的信任模型中，每個成員擁有兩個集合：直接信任度表 (Direct Trust 
Set；T Set) 以及建議者偏差度表 (Recommender Trust Set；R Set)。直接信任度表紀錄自
己本身親身經驗，存放結構為{目標物，種類，經驗次數(從等級一到等級十)}；建議者
偏差度表紀錄自己與建議者之間的偏差度，存放結構為{目標物，種類，每個等級的偏差
程度(從等級一到等級十)}。而以下為計算信任度步驟： 
 計算直接信任度：當成員要計算對某種種類或目標物的直接信任度時，從直接信任
度表中取出經驗次數最高的等級當為直接信任度。如Table 2，成員一對種類c1且目
標物t1的直接信任度為等級五。

 更新建議者偏差度：根據收到的回饋，發現建議者原本建議與實際上有著訊息上的
偏差，設此偏差為Bd。假設原本的此成員給的建議值為等級Ｌ，此成員建議者偏差
度表上在等級Ｌ的偏差值為eL。利用exponential smoothing method，假設時間參數為
r，利用eL=(1-r)*eL+r*Bd的方式來更新建議者偏差度。如Table 9，假設r為0.4，發現
成員一與成員二有著在此一次經驗中有著等級二的差距，Bd為2（等級五減掉等級
三），更新成員一對成員二在等級三的建議者偏差度為1.4，更新公式如下：
1.4=0.6*1+0.4*2成員一與成員三則有著負等級一的差距，Bd為-1（等級五減掉等級
六），更新成員一對成員三在等級六的建議者偏差度為-0.4，更新公式如下：
-0.4=0.6*0+0.4*(-1)。 
b) 同儕網路信任模型 
近年來，以同儕網路 (peer-to-peer network) 架構為基礎設計信任模型是一熱門研究主題
[6][7][8]。同儕網路架構可再細分成結構化同儕網路 (structured peer-to-peer network) 和
非結構化同儕網路 (unstructured peer-to-peer network)，在同儕網路下建構信任運算引擎
有以下方式：以信任矩陣 (trust matrix)，特徵值 (eigenvector) 與信任覆蓋網路 (Trust 
Overlay Network；TON)。 
PeerTrust [6]以五項回饋因素 (feedback factors) 包含 peer records, scope, credibility, 
transaction context和community context來計算使用者的可靠度，其中peer records為使用者
相互滿意度回饋，scope為使用者被評價的次數，credibility是回饋的可靠度，transaction 
context為交易內容的重要程度，community context是為了增加使用者回饋的意願，防止
只使用服務而不提供回饋的現象 (稱為free riding)。 
PowerTrust [7]提出信任覆蓋網路的概念，信任覆蓋網路是同儕網路上的一個虛擬網路，
有向邊代表一個使用者給另一個使用者的滿意度，此滿意度也是區域信任度 (local trust 
value) 經過系統蒐集計算後，將產生每個使用者的全域信任度 (global trust value)，此全

Fig. 10 信任運算引擎設計 
 
在行動裝置上，傳統的使用者介面並不友善，當畫面佈滿元件時，常常誤觸元件而造成
非預期的結果。為避免此問題，我們開發了客製化的使用者介面，如 Fig. 11所示。我們加
入「拉」的元素到使用者介面 (如 Fig. 11 (a))，避免使用者誤觸按鈕。此外，我們設計了可
觸控式類比時鐘 (如 Fig. 11 (b))、上下拖曳式介面 (如 Fig. 11 (a)和(c))和左右拖曳式介面 (如
Fig. 11 (d)，(e)和(f))。我們在使用者介面中加入了動作偵測，例如在螢幕上劃線、螢幕上畫
圈、舉起手機、手機左右搖晃和敲打螢幕，這種操作方式，增加使用上的樂趣，並且增加手
機與使用者之間的互動。我們也初步實作了信任模型在此雛型中，信任度以星星表示 (如
Fig. 11 (f))，使用者可以藉由星星來判斷想邀請的人是否是能夠信任。

中差異來設計適用於大量使用者的信任模型。我們實作了人本計算加值服務平台的雛形 
(命名為Fun Pull)。在 Fun Pull 系統平台，我們設計了友善的使用者介面以提高使用的便
利性與滿意度。Fun Pull 作品參加了由經濟部工業局舉辨的2010 MobileHeroes通訊大賽，
全台灣業界與學界共有82隊參與競賽，15隊入圍決賽，本作品是唯一團隊同時取得了企業
特別獎與優等獎兩獎項。我們針對相關之系統說明正在準備投稿中。

速的傳播到世界上每一個角落。在Web 2.0 的世界中，廣告（或廣播）與窄播（或群播）會
是非常重要的服務。每個人可以為了推銷某個產品或概念，在有限的時間之內，將傳達這個
概念的一段訊息或一個短片，盡可能廣泛的傳送給周遭的所有人；另一個人則可能會想讓自
己成為一個獨立的窄播媒體中心(Narrowcasting Media Center)，將一段呈現個人特殊風格的
訊息或一個短片，即時的分享給具有某些特定關係或擁有某些特殊通訊設備的人。因此Web 
2.0，已悄悄的將過去以通訊傳輸技術為主的網路概念，轉化成以人為核心的人本通訊網路
(Human Centric Communication Network)。 
 
人本通訊網路是一個以人為中心所形成的通訊網路，亦是以社交網路為基礎
(Social-network-based)之架構。提供我們以具彈性且直覺的方式來存取與情境相關的資訊，
以及與他人的訊息交換。一般而言，人與人之間存在一到多種非對稱的依存關係，例如友誼、
親屬關係、經濟關係、信仰關係，知識或聲望。在現代的社會中，每個人身上更是有許許多
多不同的通訊設備，人與人之間可以透過這些功能各異、傳輸費用不同的各種通訊設備來彼
此聯繫。在引入人的因素之後，要在這樣的人本網路中進行廣播與群播，其效果與所需的代
價，將會與每個人傳遞訊息時所選擇的通訊模式以及人際關係息息相關，因此需要同時考慮
因人際關係以及每個人身上所攜帶不同通訊設備的綜合效應。目前預定引用社交網路理論，
來描述非對稱性的人際關係以及其影響；也將同時引用感知互助網路技術來描述不同通訊設
36 
 
非人與人之間的通訊聯結並非永遠存在。為了提早掌握此關鍵性技術，本計畫將從社會學系
的社會網路理論切入，再提出適用於人本通訊網路的群播與廣播解決方案。本子計畫的目標
是是要探討在人本通訊網路上進行廣播與群播的限制與挑戰，建構可具體描述人本通訊網路
的系統模型，並定義出適用於廣播與群播的效能參數(如資訊的散播率)，能找到可以在有限
經費下可以讓最多人收到訊息的廣播方法，讓廣告效益最大化(如平均花費在一個人的廣告
費用)，讓廣告商可以用最合乎個人經濟效益的通訊模式，將訊息大量的傳播出去，其中，
我們將利用賽局理論的報償機制(payment-based mechanism)，提供簡易的誘因(incentive)，使
一部分的人願意協助將廣告散播出去。預定探討人本通訊網路之網路模型、人本通訊網路之
有效廣播群播技術等二個關鍵技術。

III.3 Literature Survey 
人與人之間的溝通，就是通訊最原始的概念，通訊技術與人類的生活密切相關。不斷的
改進通訊品質與技術，帶領人類通往更便利與人性化的生活，是我們所背負的社會意義。以
人為中心，科技為半徑，我們畫出了新一代通訊概念的理想圓，名之為人本通訊網路
(Human-Centric Communication Network, HCCN)。它代表的不只是一種新的通訊概念，而是
從完全不一樣的想法切入，從人性的角度出發，以發展出更便利的通訊方式。人本通訊網路
包含了兩個重點，一個是以人為中心，討論人與人之間的關係與社交行為，其中，社交網路
分析(social network analysis, SNA )可以提供相關的理論基礎；另一個是則討論每個人隨身行
動裝置(mobile equipment)與行動裝置之間的互相建立連線(connect)與資料交換。 
 
近年來網路社群如Facebook ，MySpace 或是Fliker 等的興起，造成了一個值得注意的
新的網路現象。社交網路一開始是在人類學(anthropology)被提出的觀念，主要方向在研究人
與人之間的活動關係。社交網路分析(social network analysis, SNA)則是將人類的社交行為用
網路模型加以描述，再用網路的基本理論，對社交行為的運作過程進行分析研究。社交網路
分成以下三大類: 
(1) 第一類社交網路致力於發展社交網路架構(structure)，希望能找到可以模  擬行為的方
法，完整分析一個群體(group) 內各個獨立個體成員的特性。 
(2) 第二類社交網路透過分析節點與節點之間的關係(relationships)和流量(flows)的方式，建
立組織(organizations)與群體(group) 。 
(3) 第三類社交網路則主要討論如何縮短社交網路內彼此連接的距離，以及在既有的社交網
40 
 
在針對以人為中心所建構出的社交網路為基礎下做分析以及研究(如圖一)，並且將感知及互
助式網路的概念引入，因此我們將研究的概念分成了兩大類： 
 
(1). 以社交網路為基礎(Social Network-Based)：為了模擬社交網路的情形，我們必須了解以
及分析人與人、人與群體或是群體對群體之間的互動。在這個部份，我們採用社會學的理論，
共識網路(Affiliation Network)來模擬及描述人際關係的方式，型成社會層(Social Layer)，以
利後續對於人際關係研究。 
(2). 以感知/互助式網路為基礎(Cognitive/Cooperative Network-Based)：當社交網路的溝通方
式以及行為模式建立之後，當整個網路在運作時，此一層級可以提供資料的傳遞管道，因此
會要了解周遭有哪些多媒體的媒介可以選擇，為此，在此建立的網路層(Communication 
Layer)。

 Fig. 12 人本通訊網路的系統模型 
如Fig. 12所示，為三層所形成的HCCN網路概念；由I個使用者、J個社群團體(Social 
group)、K個無線存取網路(Radio access network)所構成(如GSM/GPRS、WiFi、3G、WiMAX
等等)。在該網路中，每個人配置一無線感知裝置(Cognitive radio device)，該裝置可以存取
多種不同的RAN，使用者可使用數個RAN，且與第i個RAN連結的機率為qi,k，該值與使用者
存取網路的行為及權限有關，若該用戶無使用權限，則qi,k = 0。每個使用者可參予多個社群
42 
 
金CH；由於一般使用者是自私或是理智的(selfish or rational)，因此，透過賽局理論的報償機
制(payment-based mechanism)，廣告商必須給予誘因(incentive)，為此我們假設當使用者成功
將一廣告資訊給予一朋友時，將獲得獎勵，使得協助式用戶願意將資訊散播在社群網路上
面；另Ni(t)為使用者i在時間t所吸引到的朋友數，則該用戶共可獲得的獎勵共 )()( tNtU ii α= 。
而廣告商所必須做到的事情為，找尋n個協助式用戶(helping-user)，將廣告資訊散播程度最
大化，其數學模型如下:

其限制條件為
1
( ( ) ) ,

+ ≤∑ 而參數B表該廣告商總共的預算資金。代表著，當協助
式用戶數量增加時，雖說會增加資訊的散播率，但很有可能發生廣告商預算不足的現象，相
反的，若是因擔心預算會不足而減少協助式用戶的數量，將會導致資訊散播率較差的局面，
因此，如何選擇適當的協助式用戶，將會是一挑戰。 
 
系統參數上的設定，本研究定義兩系統參數，第一為感染率(Influence rate)，其模型如
下: 
1
( ) ( ) ( ) ,/

IR T N T o T I

  
∑  
代表該廣告資訊在人群中散播的程度。而另一參數為廣告商平均花費在每一個用戶上的
代價，其模型如下: 
[ ]

n

i
PUR T B B T N T o T

∑  
因此，當該值越小時，代表該廣告商所找到的協助式用戶(helping user)其所擁有的朋友
數量大，且該使用者與朋友之間之互動相當良好，導致訊息可順利散播出去，進而降低花費
在每一個用戶的廣告費用。 
 
在應用層面需求方面，根據廣告或是對特定族群資訊傳播的需求，理論上，欲連接到不
認識的對象或是族群，根據統計平均大概透過六個人便可以連接到，因此在有目的地的情況

Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until the remaining budget cannot afford any new helping-user.  
 
在研究中發現，由於協助式用戶(helping user)彼此之間會有共同交集的朋友，導致資訊
的散播效率不如預期，因此在選擇協助式用戶(helping user)時必須要考量任兩個協助式用戶
(helping user)之間的關連性，必須將該關聯性降至為零，使得共同交集之朋友數量下降，使
得資訊散播程度提升，其條件如下: 
, , 0k i i ks s× =  
因此，將該條件納入考量協助式用戶(helping user)一準則時，修改MAI演算法的 Step3，
形成另外的演算法MAILC(maximum in-degree value and less correlation)，相對地，將該條件
納入考量協助式用戶(helping user)一準則時，修改 MII演算法的 Step3，形成另外的演算法
MIILC(minimum in-degree value and less correlation)。 
 
本年度是計畫的第一年，藉由社會學的共識網路 (Affiliation Networks)，建立並提出
HCCN 系統模型之外，還提出四種找尋重要領導者的演算法，MAI(Maximum In-degree 
value)、MAILC(Maximum In-degree value and Less Correlation)、MII(Minimum In-degree value)
及MIILC(Minimum In-degree value and Less Correlation)，觀察系統效能，感染率(IR, Influence 
Rate)及 PUR(Per-User-Reward)。於參數設定上面，整個 HCCN網路的用戶數為 I = 200、社
群團體數為 J = 20、RAN的數量為 K = 5、社群團體的參予率 Ps=0.05；其中廣告商之預算
為 B = 100、CH = 1，作為報償為 = 0.1，使得協助式用戶願意將資訊散播開來。在 Fig. 12
中(a)(b)(c)中，為分別代表改變每個用戶感知到網路的機率 PR，由模擬的曲線趨勢可知，IR
會隨著時間的增加而增加直至飽和狀態，這是因為時間越長，則用戶越有較多機會連結上協
助式用戶(Helping-user)並取得該廣告資訊，從圖可以發現，MAILC的 IR會贏MAI，這是因
為 MAILC可以選擇到不相關的協助式用戶(Helping-user)，使得協助式用戶(Helping-user)之
間的交友圈重疊程度下降，達到較佳的 IR；其中較有趣的事，當用戶感知到網路的機率增
46 
 
擇的重要領導者(Important Actor)為不相關的，導致會選擇到較多的重要領導者(Important 
Actor)，因此，MAILC是個用藉由 PUR的犧牲換取 IR的作法。 
 
III.5 Result and Discussion 
第一年建構可具體描述人本通訊網路的系統模型，並定義出適用於廣播與群播的效能參
數。透過人類社會學的共識網路(Affiliation Network)，建構人的非對等之行為模式，即描述
非對稱性的人際關係以及其影響，透過不同的通訊管道將資訊傳遞出去；也將同時引用感知
互助網路技術來描述不同通訊設備的使用情況，當感知裝置可以感應到多個RAN時，將會
有效地提昇資訊的散播率。本計畫提出HCCN系統模型，並透過賽局理論，提供簡單的報償
機制(Payment-based mechanism)使用戶願意成為協助式用互、四種協助式用互的選擇演算法
來最大化IR及PUR兩系統參數。從模擬結果可知，協助式用互的選擇方式會影響著IR及PUR。 
 
本年度成果以整理程研討會論文投稿，即將於七月份於伊斯坦堡舉行的IWCMC會議的 
Human-Centric Communications and Networking Workshop中發表，因此出席國際學術會議心
得報告將於明年度的結案報告中一併附上。

IV. Theoretic Analysis and Cooperation Incentive 
Mechanism Design for Human-Centric Communication 
and Social Networking 
IV.1 Introduction 
隨著現代通訊科技的發展，人們與人群互動的渴望快速的成長，即時的線上社交網路已
經成為世界上最熱門的網路服務之一，然而，當使用這些社交網路的應用時，最令使用者沮
喪的就是那排山倒海，但是卻似乎對自己並不重要的龐大資訊量。在這個研究中，我們利用
線上社交網路的網路組成分析，來探所過載的資訊量對使用者的行為影響。在我們建構的模
型中，使用者的資訊量被定義為於他/她的朋友所擁有的朋友總個數。對使用者來說，存在
著某種特定的資訊量，是使用者能最大化效益函數的。有鍵於此，我們考慮以下兩種研究模
型：邀請成為朋友的行為需要/不需要付出成本。我們發現到當使用者是較冷漠短視(不願主
動與人交友)，而且主動結交朋友需要付出成本時，一個蓬勃的線上社交往網路幾乎無法形
成與成長。我們也研究了幾個例子來探討平衡網路的特性，並以模擬的結果驗證了我們的觀
點。 
IV.2 Conference Report 
IV.2.1 Process 
On September 20th , there are some co-located workshop for the MobiCom/MobiHoc event. 
One of the most interesting workshops is The Fifth ACM International Workshop on Wireless 
Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation and Characterization (WiNTECH 2010). In WiTECH 
workshop, testbed experiments and realistic measurement results are presented. With this type of 
50 
 
afternoon, system papers that address directional antenna issues are presented. After these 
technical sessions, demo session and poster session are held in two different rooms. We present 
our poster on “A Cognitive Relay Protocol: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation and 
Evaluation.” Several researchers and graduate students have closely interactions with us during 
the poster session. 
 
In September 23rd morning, several practical system and protocol papers are presented. One 
interesting paper by NEC Labs America is about virtualization of WiMAX service. They have 
implemented the system with WiMAX base stations and multiple WiMAX user clients. As 
interference detection and management is a critical issue in wireless network, three interesting 
papers are presented in the Interference Detection and Management session. The Sybot paper 
applies robot to automatically survey wireless network deployment sites. In September 23rd 
afternoon, several measurement based papers are presented. Those measurement based papers 
provide insightful observation on the interaction and performance issues in practical wireless 
networking deployment. In the final session, optimization based papers are presented. Mobile 
networking optimization issues are investigated here. 
IV.2.2 Report  
ACM MobiCom and ACM MobiHoc are the top conferences in mobile networking area. 
Many researchers take this event very serious. They submit their best research results to this 
conference. In addition, many well-established researchers and rising stars will attend these 
conferences. This conference trip is very valuable experience for me to discuss and interact with 
top-notch researchers in this field. As we presented our research results in ACMMobiCom poster 
sessions, we have very good chances to get valuable feedbacks from the experts. There are some 
researchers point out some critical issues and possible future directions on our research. 
 
ACM MobiCom paper is highly selective. In this year, there are totally 33 accepted papers

V. Location-Aware Wireless Social Networking: 
Applications and Technologies 
V.1 Introduction 
Number of social networking services rise sharply. The success of social networking software 
and service is not a coincidence. Social networking software and service change the normal way 
of information exchange between people. In fact, it ties the human life to technology. A man who 
uses social networking software not only constructs a new relationship with another person 
beyond the limit of physical world but also can search someone who has something in common 
with him. In other words, people are inclined to connect to people with similarities. This 
breakthrough reconnects the relationship between people that nearly broken because of time or 
location. For instance, you may find your neighbor in childhood who moved far way a couple 
years ago on social networking service.  
 
However, the rapid growth of social networking services brings many new issues.Here are 
three key issues that we are interested: 
1. Relation between physical interaction and virtual social network online: Since most of 
the smart phones are embedded with a GPS chip, which would be a good solution of 
finding people where they are. People can use the mobile phone applications, such as 
Google maps, for navigation. However, more and more social networking services such as 
Foursquare [1] support location sharing based on mobile devices. This breakthrough ties 
the social network of real life to virtual life in Internet through location. For example, 
someone may make a new friend on location-based social network service not because 
they both like playing online games. Instead, they live in the same neighborhood. We try to 
54 
 
Due to imperfect localization, the information embedded in the message contains the 
coordinates of point A. If user 2 finds himself at a music store, he may later on receive the 
message (left at the location that is R meter away from point A) since the SNS may mistakenly 
conclude that user 2 is at point A, again due to imperfect localization. In other words, the example 
shows the maximum error could be up to twice of the precision of the localization technique, or 60 
meters in the case of GPS. In urban environments, our experiments suggest that the error could be 
easily up to several hundreds of meters or more. 
 
 
Fig. 14. Maximum localization errors in mobile SNS 
 
V.2 Objective and Goal 
V.2.1 Program Development 
This is the start point of our research development. We propose a system model iballoon that 
supply the following new services: 
1. Space Capsule: 
iballoon allows a user leave a digital footprint in a place. The footprint includes text message, 
a picture or an audio message. The space capsule is hidden in the air of the place that it was 
made. Once another user passes through that place he can watch that footprint. Fig. 15 shows 
the main idea of space capsule. 
2. Data Collection: 
56 
 
V.2.2 Performance Analysis of Cooperative Localization 
In order to solve the problem, we propose a user-level cooperative localization scheme. Our 
scheme is developed based on the fact that existing handheld devices are generally equipped with 
GPS and short-range radios such as Bluetooth. These new embedded hardware allows users to 
obtain geo-coordinates from the infrastructure (e.g., GPS or cellular networks), and estimate the 
distance between users in vicinity. With exchange of these information, new and more accurate 
coordinates can be obtained and used by the location-based SNSs. It is noted that there exist many 
so-called cooperative localization solutions in wireless sensor networks. The majority of the 
existing work focuses on the relative position among devices (e.g., robots or vehicles) without 
support from infrastructure. Our “cooperative” localization, however, utilizes the infrastructure 
localization support with cooperation from each other. 
V.3 Literature Survey 
Foursquare [1] and Gowalla [3] let users to share their location by checking in at one place. A 
user not only checks in but also leaves a message or photo at a spot. However, neither Foursquare 
nor Gowalla proposed a possible method to preserve users’ privacy. iFIND [4] let users to make 
peer to peer connection to share location information to their friends such that servers will never 
know the location of a user. Nevertheless, iFIND has a fatal disadvantage that it only uses Wi-Fi 
localization. It is impossible for us to store a huge AP location table in our system not to mention 
collecting every AP’s location in the world. Moreover, no matter which service we mentioned 
above no of them use cooperative localization. In other words, those services will bump into 
localization problems. For example, Foursquare enforces users to take a picture in front of a store 
otherwise they cannot receive reword the store offers. 
58 
 
Bluetooth, ZigBee or ultra-wide band (UWB). In general,  since neither GPS nor the 
short-range radio is perfect. In our solution, we assume that r is much more accurate than  
given that some short-range radios (e.g., UWB) can achieve a precision of less than 1 meter. To 
simplify our analysis below, we further assume that r is the actual distance between users A and B, 
and they utilize this information to find the new MMSE estimators of PA and PB. 
 
Fig. 16 illustrates a scenario where users A and B obtain their coordinates from the GPS and 
their distance . The circles, CA and CB, represent the possible locations of users A and B, 
respectively, when only the GPS information is available. If the distance information r is also 
provided, the locations of users A and B can only in the shadowed areas shown in the figure. For 
example, user B can only be in the overlap of circles CA’ and CB, where CA’ is also centered at GA 
but with a radius of . 
 
Fig. 16. Redistricted areas of users A and B 
 
A. MMSE estimator when r is available  
 
Given that the areas where user A and user B may be located are changed, the distributions of 
PA and PB are no longer uniformly distributed. Take the two intersection points of CA’ and CB, 
namely IB,1 and IB,2 as an example. These two points are less likely to be the location of user 
B than any point inside the shadow area. Therefore, we need to obtain the probability density 
60 
 
  
Fig. 17. Equal probability density at any point 
of arc lx,B 
Fig. 18. illustration 
 
Instead of deriving the marginal pdf of  directly via  and , lets first consider the 
estimator  for .  is said to be the MMSE estimator of  if and only if 
      (3) 
is minimized. If we analogize the probability density  in Eq. (3) to the mass density of 
the shadowed area (i.e., the overlap of  and ) at point , the MMSE estimator  
becomes the center of mass (CoM) of that area. Thus, we will obtain  by calculating the 
CoM of the shadowed area made by  and  in Fig. 18. 
 
It has been shown that any point on arc  has the same probability density, which is 
proportional to the length of arc . Note that such an arc is inside the overlap of circles  
and , and can be uniquely defined by its distance to circle , . If the arc is inside 
circle  (e.g.,  and  in Fig. 19), x has a negative value. Otherwise, x is positive 
(e.g., ). Given that all such arcs must be inside both  and , we have 
. For any given x, the CoM of 
arc  is obtained as 
62 
 
Fig. 20 when . For such x's,  in Eq. (5a) should be replaced by . If 
, arc  also becomes a circle ─ with a radius of 
 ─ as also shown in Fig. 20. For such x's,  in Eq. (5a) should be replaced by 
. The CoM of such circles is located at  and thus,  in Eq. (4a) 
becomes 0. 
 
In the case of , circle  (i.e., ) degenerates to a single point  as 
shown in Fig. 21. One can observe from the figure that the union of all arcs  for 
 and all circles  for 
 
 
If has covered the entire shadowed area formed by circles  and . Therefore, the lef 
endpoint of integration interval in Eq. (5a) should be replaced by  instead of  in 
order to correctly calculate the CoM of the shadowed area.

simulation, only the points in EA and EB with integer-values coordinates will be selected and 
considered. The procedure is repeated for 400000 times and the number of occurrence, 
, for each legitimate pair ( ) is recorded. Finally, we take the average of all 
's in each case and calculate their standard deviation. The results are also shown in 
Table II-1. The result that the standard deviation is much smaller than the average ─ 
especially when we have sufficient data points (i.e., the average is large) ─ shows that  
for different legitimate pairs ( ) in each case are almost the same. In other words, our 
claim of  for all  is verified.

to relying on GPS only, by up to 50% and provides location precision that is needed for wireless 
and mobile SNS. 
V.6 Summary 
In iballoon, we build a system to collect users data. The data includes location, timestamp 
and three types of messages including text message, audio message and images. iballoon is 
specially designed to evaluate the location-based information dissemination which is different 
from the conventional social networking. The platform will be used intensively in National 
Taiwan University campus in the second year in order to collect the first-hand, real user data. On 
the other hand, the proposed cooperative localization improves the location accuracy up to 70%. 
This new scheme has been accepted to be presented in IEEE IWCMC 2011. In the second year, we 
will implement the cooperative localization scheme to improve localization accuracy and power 
consumption of mobile devices.

VI. Information Dynamics of Human-Centric 
Communication and Social Networking 
VI.1 Introduction 
The purpose of this research project is to seek fundamental breakthroughs in human’s 
knowledge about human-based communication networks and thus the application based on it, to 
develop the new generation of human behavior-based research and related theory based on it. We 
shall execute some pioneer explorations into this goal from frontiers of human-based 
communication networks and different branches of science (physics, mathematics, cognitive, and 
social). 
 
We have recognized that, Tremendous growing of Internet applications and services creates a 
new life style for human being. With the help of web 2.0, Facebook and many popular Internet 
services leverage social relationship to achieve great success, such that people pay attention to 
individuals and relations constructing an equivalent network structure, known as social networks. 
Social networks [1] [2] impacts the behaviors and interactions among people, groups, and Internet 
services, may contain an unimaginably vast amount of digital data that is getting even more vaster 
and more rapidly. To effectively manipulate and to compute these data creates a new dimension of 
challenge and new possibility of learning more information to facilitate Internet services. Such 
data typically comes from the network structure with million or billions of vertices and edges, 
showing great complexity both in dimension and composition. Despite the abundance of tools to 
capture, to process and to share all data - sensors, computers, mobile phones and user behaviors, 
etc. - it is still very wanted to develop efficient computation and maintenance. Moreover, we 
usually wish to infer appropriate actions or decisions [3] to meet some application purposes from 
74 
 
belonging to a state space, , an observation space is a collection of graph with 
finite vertices and edges. Each vertex in observation space corresponding to a observable 
attributes  and edges to connect those attributes that we judge to be directly related. In general, 
Y = f  but  may reserve unknown. A sampling process  is a relation from 
state space to observation space. Thus, data is a sampling on the observation space. The goal of 
data processing is to draw any information about  based on observing . If we define 
any formate of cost function , the data processing is designing the function to 
satisfy  where . This is a very complicated 
optimization problem, however, many techniques and theory has been developed to be introduced 
on this report. 
 
Regarding the issues of information and data processing on social network, many literatures 
have discussed it in variety of views. From social network analysis aspect, most of the discussions 
are based on fundamental knowledge of social network structures [5], [6], [7]. Thus we have the 
studying of distributed search [8], [9], information exchange [10], diffusion of social influence [11] 
and evolution of social networks [12] [13]. Such research focuses on the properties of information 
and data on the social network and derives many features of corresponding behavior models; 
however, lacking the study of how to processing the information and data. Some exactly solvable 
models of the structure of social networks, based on random graphs with arbitrary degree 
distributions are derived to capture some properties of the data in social networks [14]. On the 
other hand, without the consideration of data collection, we have developed statistical inference 
and signal processing [15], regression analysis [16], and nonlinear data structure analysis [17]. 
These treatment focus on deriving optimal information extraction (i,e,  and seldom reach 
the topics of data with correlations and high dimensions). 
76 
 
IDD in well-known complex networks by modiﬁed Susceptibl e-Infected (SI) model, which is 
surprisingly suitable for above multiple scenarios. Systematically categorizing such networks and 
examining conditions to adopt SI model for IDD in complex networks, the fundamental properties 
including mixing type, vertex connectivity and giant component size provide valid insights for 
quantitative analysis. We also investigate the IDD in networks with time-varying topology and 
show that all individuals receive the information in dynamic sense, even if the giant component 
size is not compatible with the number of individuals in static sense. Consequently, we 
successfully establish such an analytical model for characterizing the IDD in complex networks 
consisting of opportunistic links and time-varying topology, feasible for various random wireless 
networks and social networks. 
 
With the advancement of wireless communication and the Internet, information 
dissemination plays an important rolein large-scale networks consisting of numerous individuals 
such as machine-to-machine communications and relation-based social networks. As a powerful 
tool for aggregating multiple networks of interests into an uniﬁed manner, complex  network [1], 
[2] has evolved in recent years to model various network topologies observed in current networks. 
For instance, community resembles Erdos-Renyi (ER) network, AS-level routers and the World 
Wide Web resemble power-law distributed networks, wireless sensors resemble lattice (regular) 
networks and relations between acquaintances resemble small-world networks. Although various 
efforts have been done regarding the analysis of IDD in certain type of network for a particular 
purpose such as Inﬂuenza,  we may unify the IDD in different networks with the aid of complex 
network notions since many networks of interests share common features. Moreover, it is still 
desirable to understand over the topology of a random network evolving withtime due to mobility, 
and opportunistic links (e.g. MANET, CRN and social networks) [3]. It still opens to precisely 
describe the IDD concerning large-scale time-varying network topology. The approach of tracking 
adjacency matrix can perfectly capture the entire network topology but at the cost of high 
computation complexity for time-varying topology, and is hence hardly useful to investigate 
78 
 
characterizes the IDD without the knowledge of adjacency matrix. 
VI.2.2 Part 2: Malware Propagation  
The popularity of mobile smart phones with richer wireless communication capabilities 
allows extensive social interactions in the following aspects. First, the communication between an 
individual and his friends in personal social network interconnected by call records and contacts is 
facilitated by portability of handset. Second, smart phones equipped with short-range wireless 
communication (SRWC) technology such as WiFi or Bluetooth (BT) realize peer-to-peer 
communication between individuals in geographic proximity, building a spatial social network. 
Such geographical interdependency for the individuals in cellular infrastructure couples personal 
social network with spatial social network as a generalized social network, which amplifies the 
opportunities for attacks from self-replicating malware. The malware on handsets typically 
exploits messaging services [1] or uses SRWC services to propagate. The differential 
equation-based approach characterizing virus spreading in Internet [2], [3] is feasible to model the 
messaging malware dissemination due to homogeneity holds in person social network. On the 
other hand, the behavior of malware spreading by SRWC services was approximated by 
differential equation [4], [5] or investigated by agent-based simulation [6], [7].

Nowadays a major property of technological networks is the existence of information 
platform on which people share and exchange information on it easily (e.g., websites and 
discussion board on the Internet, regular meeting of companies or organizations), and thus 
produce a large amount of data that needs to be processed, delivered, and accessed according to 
the objectives of application on it. The way these data are manipulated by the social networks 
agents is a fundamental issue. Under this scenario, information fusion arises as a response to 
process data gathered by information platforms and benefits from their processing capability for 
more application based on it. On the social network, information fusion involves not only the 
inference from personal observations but also the decision making given knowing others’ decision 
on the information platform. For example, we often refer others’ judgment or rating on the website 
before starting any transaction with an on-line seller. Such information is a consequence of the 
interaction among agents in social networks, in which the relationship between agents shows great 
impact on the formation of information. Relationship in social network is regarded as social 
network structure. Many works have admitted that the social network structure does impacts the 
function and behavior of information on it, such as information exchange [2] and dynamics [3]. 
The information on such networks exhibits patterns quite different from classical scenario and 
thus requires more suitable consideration for designing criterion for optimal information fusion.  
 
The main features of information on social networks are displayed as follow: The issue we 
encounter is the rapid growth in dimension and complicatedness of the information resulting from 
the complexity and huge scale of the network, which makes it cumbersome and non-practical to 
implement deterministic topology to satisfy the demand of analysis. However, statistical 
mechanics provides a statistical view to describe the characteristic of network in the fashion of 
complex network [4] [5]. We also receive great success on communication networks with 
statistical communication theory, thus a statistical approach shall be the first concern. Furthermore, 
the information on the social network is also suffered from not only the interference form personal 
82 
 
Internet router topology [2], [8], the links of world-wide web (WWW) [2] and the e-mail network 
[9] have been shown to be power-law distributed, and such complex networks are also renowned 
as scale-free networks [10] when  since their second and higher order moments of 
degree distribution are usually divergent. An essential feature of scale-free networks is that there 
exists a small fraction of nodes as hubs in the network with much higher degrees than ordinary 
nodes, which render complex networks quite fragile when the hubs are out of order. 
 
Due to the existence of hubs in complex networks, Albert et al. [11] have shown that a 
power-law distributed network is quite tolerant to random node failures (removals) while it is very 
sensitive to selective removals, where paralyzing a small fraction of nodes with highest degrees 
leads to network disruption, known as an intentional attack. Cohen et al. [12] proposed an 
analytical model to evaluate the critical point for network breakdown under intentional attack in 
percolation sense, and Xiao et al. [13] verified that intentional attack is the most fatal attack to 
disrupt the network when the network topology is known to the attacker. The disruption of a 
complex network thereby incurs disastrous threats to the networking reliability, especially for 
routing in communication networks To the best of our knowledge, currently there is no effective 
defense mechanism to deal with such fatal attack. 
 
To tackle the vulnerability of a complex network under intentional attack, in this paper we 
firstly propose a fusion-based defense to enhance the network robustness. As illustrated in Fig. 1, 
since the impacts of node quarantine on the network are not visible at node level, each node 
performs local detection via intrusion detection or anomaly detection on suspicious activities 
[14]–[17] and then feedbacks minimum (one-bit) decision to the fusion center due to limited 
capacity and finite energy constraint. At the network level, the fusion center fuses the feedbacks to 
infer the presence of attack. By evaluating the network resilience, the fusion center launches 
immediate defense reactions if an attack at the network level is detected, otherwise it keeps 
surveillance on the network to mitigate the potential cost from false alarms.  
84 
 
Internet users) the vertices and denote communication channels (e.g. physical channels orsocial 
relations) between any two individuals the edges on a undirected graph G(V, E), where V is the set 
containing all individuals, E is the set containing all communication channels and | V |= N is the 
total number of vertices. By epidemic terminology we denote a vertex is informed as it is infected, 
otherwise it is susceptible (uninfected). We assume that a vertex is capable of receiving multiple 
information from its neighbors and avoid collision. And the informed vertices adopt “consistent 
broadcasting” behavior so that an informed vertex tends to transmit the information to susceptible 
vertices in contact consistently, just as spread of epidemics.  
 
Consequently, we map the IDD to SI model [4]. Since the status of a channel is not always 
stable due to the channel access and its condition, capability of the vertex (network node) and 
Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints, information may not be successfully transmitted, which 
deﬁnes opportunistic links in such networks. We introduce a two-state Markov chain for 
opportunistic links atop communication channels (i.e. on and off). Hence the informed rate 
(infectionrate) λ is equivalent to the probability β transiting to on state independently among 
channels. And the IDD are equivalent to i(t), the fraction of informed vertices with respect to time. 
The following deﬁnitions and lemmas clarify the notions. 
 
Deﬁnition 1. For a communication channel between two vertices at arbitrary time t, a link is 
present with probability β that the information is transmitted from the informed end to the 
susceptible end.  
 
Lemma 1. The graph G(V , L) is a spanning subgraph of G(V, E), where L is the set containing all 
links at arbitrary time t. 
Proof: ∀ e ∈ E, a link l exists with probability β at arbitrary time t. We denote the relation by 
indicator function 1L(e). Since G(V , E ) and G(V, L) has the same vertex set V, and L is a subset 
of E, G(V, L) is a spanning subgraph of G(V, E). 
86 
 
nodes 𝑁 in the network which are assumed to be stationary and uniformly distributed with node 
density 𝜌. We assume that all nodes are MMS- and BTenabled to maintain the homogeneous 
mixing property. Denote subpopulation function (𝑡) = 𝐼𝐵𝑇 (𝑡)+𝐼𝑀𝑀𝑆(𝑡) as the total number of 
compromised handsets at time 𝑡, where 𝐼𝐵𝑇 (𝑡) and 𝐼𝑀𝑀𝑆(𝑡) are those that have been infected via 
BT and MMS at time 𝑡, respectively. Likewise, (𝑡) denotes the set of susceptible nodes at time 𝑡. 
Obviously, we have 
 
Without loss of generality, we assume that only one handset is infected at the initial stage, that is, 
(0) = 𝐼𝑀𝑀𝑆(0) = 1 and 𝐼𝐵𝑇 (0) = 0. The rates of malware infection 𝛽𝐵𝑇 and 𝛽𝑀𝑀𝑆 respectively 
represent the probabilistic rates at which an infective node communicates with and compromises a 
susceptible node through BT and MMS. The average degrees of a node connecting via BT and 
MMS are denoted as 𝜂𝐵𝑇 and 𝜂𝑀𝑀𝑆, respectively.

interference or wrong interpretation from measurement/observation errors. It is also defined by a 
set  with the relation to the elements in event space , i.e., we have a relation function 
 where  implies error term. Such relation is best described in probability theory. 
 
Definition 5. (Decision Space) The decision of the agent made by inferring the desired event 
parameter from the observations. 
 
Generally speaking, evidence/observations also hold uncertainty itself. Given such 
evidence/observations, we form the belief in a more complicated way; we define such process as 
the cognition of belief. The basic structure of cognition of belief is most easily described in terms 
of random sets. Let  be a probability space regarding the event space. Denote the 
decision space by  being a measurable space, where  is the -algebra generated by . 
We would like to quantify our uncertainty about the statements like ”the subset  contain 
the true value ”. The relation between and  is connected by a decision 
function: , which is a mapping form  to the nonempty, closed subsets of . As the 
fact that belief is the measure of uncertainty, the definition of cognition of belief also follows the 
same concept: 
Definition 6. (Cognised Belief) The cognised belief, , is the probability that the 
random subset  is contained in , i.e. 
 
Therefore we recognize a fact that 
 
Property 1. Cognition of belief is thus formed as a statistical decision resulting from the 
measurement of belief done by observations. 
VI.3.3.2 Network Topology 
Different form the traditional society, nowadays there is a great proportion of human 
90 
 
The attack strategy of an attacker is to sabotage  nodes in descending degree 
order, where  refers to indifferent attack or uniform attack, and smaller  contributes to 
intentional attack on  nodes with highest degrees. The attack on th node is in vain if the th 
node is quarantined by the fusion center. Intuitively, uniform attack is an inadequate strategy for 
the attacker at the risk of exposed activity, whereas intentional attack is more effective since it is 
difficult to be detected by the fusion center. 
VI.3.4.2 Node Level Defense: Local Detection 
Since the a priori probability of attack and the cost of quarantine for network robustness is 
unknown at node level, each node employs Neyman-Pearson criterion for hypothesis testing with 
detection probability  and false alarm probability .  denotes the hypothesis that 
th node is under attack, otherwise . For simplicity we assume the nodes are homogeneous 
for identical detection capability, i.e., and . Based on the local detection, 
every node feedbacks one-bit information  to the fusion center, where  if th node 
declares that it is under attack, otherwise . 
VI.3.4.3 Network Level Defense: Surveillance and Quarantine 
For the defense strategy at network level, the fusion center selects  nodes 
under surveillance in descending degree order. Since the cost of quarantine for network robustness 
is known at the network level while the a priori probability of attack is still unknown, a binary 
hypothesis testing based on minimax criterion is employed at the fusion center to minimize the 
potential cost, where  if attack occurs in the network, otherwise . The fusion 
center quarantines the nodes which feedbacks the information when , or it keeps 
surveillance for potential attacks. 
VI.3.4.4 Network Resilience 
Since a complex network holds certain resilience that the network is still connected in 
92 
 
contributing to the IDD. To verify the signiﬁcance, we provide several deﬁnitions regarding the 
above properties and categorize complex network models of interests, i.e., the power-law 
distributed networks, small-world networks, Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, and lattice (regular) 
networks. 
 
Since almost all current networks are variations of the above network models, our taxonomy is a 
powerful tool for explaining the distinct IDD in complex networks. 
 
Deﬁnition 7. A network is homogeneous mixing if its degree distribution is centered at  with 
variance . Otherwise it is heterogeneous mixing. 
 
Deﬁnition 8. A network is connectible if every vertex has a positive probability to build a 
bidirectional (undirected) connection (channel) to any other vertices in the network.  
 
Based on Deﬁnition 8, we further deﬁne relevant concepts regarding the connecting 
probability and connection attribute. If the connecting probability is equal for every vertex, the 
network is equally connectible, otherwise it is unequally connectible. And If every vertex has a 
positive probability connecting to some fraction (not all) of vertices in the network, the network is 
partially connectible. 
 
Deﬁnition 9. A network is saturated if the giant component size approaches total number of 
vertices in the network, i.e., G(V, E) is saturated if the giant component G(VGC, EGC) has 
|VGC| |V|. Otherwise it is nonsaturated. 
 
Lemma 2. If a network is denoted as G(V, E), and G(V, E) is a connected graph, then the 
network is saturated. 
 
94 
 
 
for τ = k − j ≥ 0 and P(k) = 0 otherwise. 2j is the number of edges for every vertex before rewiring. 
Since the degree distribution has a pronounced peak at  = 2j and decays exponentially for 
large k [1], and the connecting probability is unequal except pW S= 1, the case of extreme 
randomness, we regard small-world network as HoMUC network. Many social network models 
are extensions of WS model since HoMUC property well explains the clustering (or centrality) 
feature. 
VI.4.1.4 Heterogeneous Mixing and Unequally Connectible (HeMUC) Network 
A power-law distributed network has degree distribution P (k) ∼ , if r is within the region 
2 ≤ r ≤ 3, then it is also called a scale-free network since the ﬁrst and second moments converge. 
Barabasi and Albert observe two essential factors of scale-free network: growth and preferential 
attachment [7], and we can construct a scale-free network by Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model. In BA 
model, every new node connects its m edges to existing nodes according to preferential attachment 
rule, and the average degree of such network is 2m. The power-law distributed degree distribution 
suggests that most vertices have few neighbors while some ”super vertices” tend to have great 
amount of neighbors, and a new vertex is hence prone to connect to those super vertices. Thus the 
power-law distributed network is a HeMUC network. We observe many HeMUC networks on the 
Internet such as links of AS-level routers and websites of the World Wide Web. 
 
Regarding the giant component size, we emphasize that if the giant component size is not 
compatible with the number of vertices, only the cluster including the initially informed vertex can 
possibly receive the information, and the condition is often ignored or implicitly excluded in many 
researches and simulations. From bond percolation theory, phase transition theory and complex 
network [1], [2], in 1995 and 1998 Molloy and Reed proved that a giant component emerges 
96 
 
over 100 times in saturated complex networks. In Fig. 39, the IDD in square lattice network 
accelerate with the increase of λ but are quite slow compared with SI model. The results are 
reasonable since a HoMPC network such as square lattice network implicitly indicates that the 
IDD are limited by its structure and the total susceptible neighboring vertices at an arbitrary time t 
are actually much less than the expected number N i(t) , giving rise to the “degree-correlated” 
problem for overestimating susceptible neighbors. 
 
Fig. 40. IDD in ER networks with N = 2500 and C = 0.0005. 
 
In Fig. 40 we run simulations in ER networks and observe that the IDD are in accordance 
with SI model. The SI model is slightly faster than the simulation curves due to degree-correlation 
problem. The reason why SI model ﬁts the IDD in ER model is that in (3) the parameters N and 
pER characterize the ER network since we have mean degree = N pER. And the HoMEC 
property regards every vertex in the network homogeneous or identical so that SI model, a simple 
ﬁrst-order differential equation, captures the IDD. We prove it from (2) by substituting = N 
pER that 
 
98 
 
most of vertices have low degrees and the initially informed vertex is chosen at random, the 
average degree increases at early stages because the information is indeed transmitted to vertices 
with higher degrees. Then the average degree decreases due to information dissemination to 
low-degree vertices and the average degree of newly informed vertices is below the mean degree 
at t0. Despite that SI model may not be suitable for describing the IDD in scale-free networks, it 
still provides us useful insights for better understanding the IDD in networks with HeMUC 
property. For example, homogeneity still holds for the vertices of the same degree, and an 
enhanced epidemic model is further described in [10]. 
 
Fig. 42. Average degree of newly informed vertices in scale-free network corresponding to Fig. 
41. 
 
In order to bridge the gap between the SI model and the IDD in complex networks, we need 
to modify the SI model so as to ﬁx the degree -correlated problem because SI model implicitly 
assumes that the neighbors of informed vertices are uncorrelated. For HoMEC networks, we 
provide an intuitive upper bound by modifying the SI model and take the degree-correlation into 
consideration. 
 
Proposition 1. For a saturated and HoMEC network, there exists an upper bound given the 
100 
 
complicated interactions within large-scale networks with mobility support (e.g. routing protocols 
in MANET). Even given the condition that a network is nonsaturated (e.g. MANET in sparsely 
populated area), we expect that a virtual giant component (the connected subgraph of possible 
connections containing a majority of V) exists and the network is virtually saturated since all 
vertices eventually receive the information due to change of connectivity. 
 
Proposition 2. A dynamic network is virtually saturated in the sense that the virtual giant 
component size approaches the number of vertices. 
 
To focus on the IDD in dynamic networks, we set the informed rate λ = 1 so that L = E in 
order to justify Proposition 2. We run simulations in networks that are nonsaturated, especially in 
ER networks and square lattice networks since the two networks represent extreme randomness 
and extreme regularity structures, providing us great insights about the impacts of dynamic 
topology on the IDD. Whereas the giant component of HeMUC network such as scale-free 
network usually exists so that the dynamicHeMUC networks are beyond our scope. 
 
Fig. 43. IDD in dynamic square lattice networks with N = 2500 and K = 4. 
 
In square lattice networks we assume there are initially K degrees for each vertex and we 
102 
 
informed rate λ contributes only to longer latency for information dissemination. The IDD in these 
two networks justify Proposition 2. And we conclude 
 
Proposition 3.   The information dissemination dynamics of a dynamic HoMEC or HoMPC 
network can be characterized by modiﬁed SI model. 
We note that the tight upper bound f (t) = 1 in static HoMEC network may not hold in 
dynamic case since the neighbors of an informed vertex may all be susceptible vertices due to 
mobility. 
 
Proposition 4. For a (virtually) saturated and homogeneous mixing network, the time T 
needed to inform iT fraction of vertices can be obtained from (6) and  if  
exists. 
Because the cumulative informed fraction approaches 1in a (virtually) saturated network, 
Proposition 4 serves a more accurate benchmark to any broadcasting mechanisms in complex  
networks since it greatly mitigates the biased estimation of susceptible neighbors due to degree 
correlation problems. 
 
Regarding the IDD in both static and dynamic complex networks, there are wide applications 
associated with the propositions. In social network, the rumor spread or propagation of the Internet 
worm within a small-world network is upper-bounded by our model, where the trust of the rumor 
or the activity of the Internet worm relates to the informed rate. In machine-to-machine 
communications with or without mobility support including cognitive radio networks (CRN), 
MANET, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and robotic networks, the informed rate is determined 
by channel condition and access, capability of devices and QoS constraints. And traditional 
methodology does not conduct such universal study. Leveraging our model, we evaluate the 
performance of epidemic routing via broadcasting in large-scale MANET where each node has the 
same transmission range R and is uniformly and randomly distributed on a D × D square ﬁeld in 
104 
 
virus seen on the Internet. Typically, it sends MMS messages to phone numbers found in the 
address book since message from an acquaintance has higher possibility to be opened and further 
activated [1]. As shown in Fig. 2, malware propagating via MMS follows a delocalized pattern 
since that contacts in address book are often far away. By extracting the contacts in the address 
book of a handset, a personal social network is constructed describing the social relationships 
between handsets, which is exploited by MMS malware for spreading. The average degree 𝜂𝑀𝑀𝑆 
of the network means the average number of contacts in the address book and infection rate 
𝛽𝑀𝑀𝑆 indicates the probability that a susceptible node becomes infected after receiving the 
malware. Please note that the probability that victim confirms and installs the malware may affect 
𝛽𝑀𝑀𝑆. Under the assumption of homogeneous mixing in the personal social network, the basic 
differential equation that describes the dynamics of infected subpopulation by MMS with time is  
 
where 𝜂𝑀𝑀𝑆 −1 accounts for the fact that one infected node implies at least one of its neighbors 
being infected.  
VI.4.2.2 Spreading Dynamics via BT  
When an infected node intends to spread malware via BT, it first scans to search the nearby 
nodes within its transmission range 𝑅𝑐 and connects to the neighbor so as to determine the 
susceptible neighbors for propagating. In this case, the average number of neighbors 𝜂𝐵𝑇 equals 
𝜌𝜋𝑅2. The probability that a susceptible node becomes infected after receiving the malware 𝛽𝐵𝑇 
depends on probability that it confirms and opens the malware. Comparing with MMS with 
delocalized pattern, the spreading effect via BT facilitated by mobility is much small and thus 
human mobility is ignored in our model. The behavior of such spontaneous spreading can be 
regarded as a ripple centered at the source infected node which grows with time [5]. It is 
approximated into our model by having only the infected nodes that lie on the periphery of an 
infection circle can communicate with the susceptible nodes located at a distance of at most 𝑅𝑐 
106 
 
spreading process. This is in accordance with the fact that a larger 𝜂𝐵𝑇 results in a larger infected 
subpopulation who could exploit both BT and MMS to spread, increasing propagation severity. 
Note that agent-based emulation model [7] and simulation [8] try to characterize behaviors of the 
𝑁 nodes and all interactions among them, which requires huge computation overhead. In contrast, 
our model aggregates the 𝑁 nodes into two states and only tracks the behavior of these two states 
and the interactions between them, such that our model can be more computationally effective. 
  
(a) Analytical        (b) simulation 
Fig. 46 illustrates the analytical and simulation plots depicting the propagation dynamics of a 
hybrid malware spreading via only BT, only MMS, and both among 2000 nodes under 𝜌 = 0.8.  
 
VI.4.2.4 Simulation Study 
To validate the analytical model, we develop experiments to simulate malware spreading via 
social and spatial interactions among 2000 individuals uniformly deployed in a 50×50 plane. The 
constructions of social networks and setup of parameters (e.g., 𝜂𝑀𝑀𝑆 = 6) follow the data sheet in 
[8]. Fig. 46(b) illustrates the time for a hybrid malware to infect a given fraction of the network, 
spreading via only BT, only MMS and both, against different values for 𝜙. Each reported result is 
averaged over 300 simulation runs. We observe that the curves of propagation dynamics closely 
match our analytical model, where limited discrepancy exists mainly due to that the hybrid 
malware may propagate to individuals who have already been infected and uncertain boundary 
conditions could not be considered in the analysis.

Theorem 2. We will take the good comments of the cooperative agent with uncertainty 
while accept all the bad comment as long as 
1) , i.e,  
2) , 
where  is the least favorable false-alarm probability. 
 
Corollary 1. The comment we take into consideration is equivalent to 
 
And 
 
 
Corollary 2. The proposition 2 also proves a fact that the propagation of information reduces the 
confidence, i.e., 
 
where  represents the ’s confidence measured by . This corollary is consistent with 
the property of trust discussed in [13] 
VI.4.3.2 Cooperative Decision 
In the previous section, we build up a way to select useful comment and evaluate the 
uncertainty toward this comment. In this section, we design the optimum decision rule with 
cooperative agent’s information (side information), that is, we try to detect  based on the 
knowledge of . 
Thus, our problem become detecting  without a priori probability and one observation , 
which is the detection result at the previous section. In addition, probability of detection and 
probability of false alarm has been determined.

VI.4.4 Part 4: Intentional attack and fusion-based defense mechanism 
Leveraging optimal fusion rule [20], [21] for attack inference at network level, let 
denote the observation obtained at the fusion center, where 
 
is the optimal coefficient for data fusion. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) at the fusion center 
is 
 
for some threshold . Since the fusion center makes a decision based on the feedbacks of  
nodes with highest degrees, adopting the k-out-of-n decision rule as consistent with [20], [21], (6) 
can be written as 
 
where  out of  nodes report attack. Without loss of generality we assume  so that 
(7) becomes 
112 
 
Consequently, given  and (10), the threshold  can be obtained by solving the following 
equation 
 
 
As shown in Fig. 47, the threshold  has a linear scalability with respect to the number of 
nodes under surveillance ( ), and higher false alarm probability contributes to larger  in order 
to minimize the potential cost introduced by erroneous node quarantine. A direct observation from 
Fig. 37 is that higher false alarm probability tends to nurture the attacker since the attacker is 
prone to disrupt the network without being detected at the fusion center if the threshold is too 
high.

the e-commerce system and model the behavior of sellers and consumers base on trust measure. A 
website topology of e-commerce is built up to demonstrate how a uses learns information in 
e-commerce and make decision. Furthermore, a distributed decision scheme is designed to 
maintain the accuracy of trust estimation and to better against potential malicious. This research 
provides a vision for designing more reliable trusted on-line market system. Besides, a more 
generalized scenario is regarding the cooperation between website and website. Through the 
theory of statistical decision, we proposed a way to select useful comment to help our decision. A 
sequential decision scheme is designed to promote the decision performance. Via the cooperation 
with other consumers within the whole networks, more useful result in the social networks and 
application only for trust modeling extended from this research can be expected in the future 
work. 
VI.5.4 Part 4: Intentional attack and fusion-based defense mechanism 
To tackle the intentional attack in complex networks, we propose a fusion-based defense 
mechanism where the defender fuses the feedbacks from local nodes for attack inference via 
optimal data fusion. We have shown that the decision threshold increases with false alarm 
probability of local node and number of nodes under surveillance. The concepts of network 
resilience and critical point for network disruption in percolation sense are introduced to account 
for network robustness. Since both attacker and defender manage to counter the opponent’s 
strategy and maximize their own payoffs, we formulate the interactions as a zero sum game and 
evaluate the performance of fusion-based defense by analyzing the optimal expected outcome. 
Through analytic results and empirical data collected from Internet and WWW, our fusion-based 
defense is shown to be reliable and effective against intentional attack, even under poor detection 
capability of local node and fragile nature of complex network. This paper therefore provides 
novel defense mechanism against fatal attacks.
