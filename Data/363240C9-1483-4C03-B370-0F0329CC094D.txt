trolthe intracellular responses that cationic dendrimers induce in
macrophages.
It has long been recognized that macrophages produce
oxygen and nitrogen-reactive metabolites during phagocytosis
or when stimulated by a variety of agents [6]. Reactive oxygen
species (ROS) such as superoxide anion (O2
−) and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) are widely investigated as signaling mediators
of both protection and destruction in macrophages [7]. ROS
are important in apoptosis because they modulate multiple
signaling pathways and transcriptional activation. ROS also
regulate the cellular redox state using antioxidant enzymes [8].
Mitochondria are both the source and target of ROS and also
responsible for producing cellular energy. Apoptotic activa-
tion of mitochondria leads to a disturbance of mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm), permeability transition, the gen-
eration of ROS, and the release of apoptotic proteins [9].
The aim of this study was to evaluate, using flow cytometry,
the intracellular events in U-937 human macrophages treated
with generation-2 and -3 PPI dendrimers. We investigated the
ROS content of O2
− and H2O2, and the changes in mitochon-
drial membrane potential after exposing macrophages to PPI
dendrimers. We also analyzed cell size and the complexity of
macrophages with PPI dendrimer treatment using flow cy-
tometry. We did a cell cycle analysis to measure cell prolifer-
ation and the apoptotic subG1 cell populations in macrophages
treated with dendrimers. Our findings provide a novel insight
into the cytotoxic effects, at the molecular level, that dendrimers
cause in macrophages.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Generation-2 and -3 PPI dendrimers (DAB 2.0 and 3.0) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals (St. Louis, MO,
USA). DAB 2.0 (DAB-8) and DAB 3.0 (DAB-16) have mo-
lecular weights of 773 and 1686 g/mole and 8 and 16 primary
surface amine groups, respectively. Propidium iodide (PI) was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were pur-
chased locally and were of the highest grade available.
2.2. Cell culture and incubation protocol
A human macrophage-like U-937 large-cell lymphoma cell
line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and 100 U/mL penicillin/
100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The U-937 cells were treated with PPI
dendrimers for the entire corresponding time period. After in-
cubation, PPI dendrimers were removed from the medium
and the cells were washed with PBS for further analysis.
2.3. Cytotoxicity assay
52 J.S. Kuo et al. / Journal of ConThe activity of dehydrogenases (an indicator of cell viability)
in the cells (1×106, treated or untreated with PPI dendrimers)was simultaneously assessed [10]. Negative control cells con-
tained no PPI dendrimers. To measure cell viability, 10 μL of a
cell-counting kit solution, a tetrazolium salt that produces a
highly water-soluble formazan dye upon biochemical reduction
in the presence of an electron carrier (1-Methoxy PMS) (Cell
Counting Kit-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan), was
added to a 100 μL culture medium and incubated for 1–4 h. The
amount of yellow formazan dye generated by dehydrogenases
in cells is directly proportional to the number of viable cells in a
culture medium. The absorbance at 450 nm was obtained using
an ELISA reader with a reference wavelength of 595 nm.
Results are reported as the cell-viability percentage (average
OD/average negative-control OD)±standard deviation (SD).
2.4. Intracellular ROS contents
To detect intracellular H2O2 content, cell suspensions
(1×106/mL) with or without dendrimer treatment were
incubated with 10 μM membrane-permeable probe dichloro-
fluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Inside cells, acetate moieties
of the probe were cleaved and oxidized, primarily by H2O2, to a
green fluorescent 2′-7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). For intracel-
lular O2
− content, 10 μM of hydroethidine (HE) incubated for
15 min was used. HE is oxidized primarily by O2
− and forms
ethidium bromide (EB), which emits red fluorescence [11]. Flow
cytometry studies were done on a flow cytometer (FACScan;
Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA). A 15-mM air-
cooled argon-ion laser was used to excite fluorescent DCF
at 488 nm, and the emitted fluorescence was measured using a
530/30-nm band-pass optical filter. Ethidium fluorescence
was excited at 488 nm and collected using a 585/21-nm band-
pass optical filter. Samples were run using 10,000 cells per
test sample. Data were analyzed using the CELL QUEST
programs.
2.5. Measuring mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm)
Mitochondrial membrane potential was determined using a
fluorescent probe, rhodamine-123 [12], a lipophilic cation that
accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix in proportion to mito-
chondrial membrane potential. Cell suspensions (1×106/mL)
were incubated with 10 μM rhodamine-123 (R-123, Sigma) for
30 min at 37 °C and then thoroughly washed three times
with PBS buffer. The fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and
analyzed using a 530/30-nm band-pass optical filter.
2.6. Cell size and complexity
Flow cytometry can discriminate a variety of cell parameters,
including cell size and complexity [13]. The typical indicators
of cell size and complexity using flow cytometry are the light
intensities of forward scatter (FSC) and 90 °C side scatter
(SSC). The FSC signal is related to the size, volume, and other
led Release 120 (2007) 51–59factors, such as the refractive index of the cell. In addition to
size and volume, the SSC signal is related to the surface texture
and internal structure of the cell.
the development of various diseases [15]. Macrophages can
produce ROS such as H2O2 and O2
− in response to interactions
with nanoparticles [4,16,17].
Although many biomedical applications using dendrimers
are successful, intracellular mechanisms that stimulate mac-
rophages remain an insufficiently studied area of obvious rele-
vance to dendrimer-based delivery systems. H2O2 production in
DAB 2.0-treated macrophages was dose- and time-dependent,
as indicated by the change in DCF fluorescence intensity
levels (Fig. 1A and B). As DAB 2.0 concentrations increased
from 40 to 300 μg/mL, intracellular DCF fluorescence intensity
decreased relative to fluorescence intensity in untreated con-
trol cells over the first 6 h. However, after longer incubation
54 J.S. Kuo et al. / Journal of Controlled Release 120 (2007) 51–59times (12 and 16 h), DCF fluorescence intensity initially slow-
ly increased at 12 h and was unchanged at 16 h, peaked at
100 μg/mL at 12 h and at 200 μg/mL at 16 h, and decreased at
300 μg/mL. In HE-treated cells, there was a significant rise in
the mean fluorescence intensity relative to untreated control
cells over the first 6 h, and then a drop in O2
− production at 12 h,
and, finally, a slow rise in cells treated with higher doses (100
to 300 μg/mL) at 16 h (Fig. 1C and D). DAB 3.0-treated
macrophages showed dose-dependent decreases in DCF
fluorescence intensity relative to untreated cells over the en-
tire incubation period (Fig. 2A and B). Also, ethidium fluo-
rescence intensity declined compared with untreated control
cells after 1, 3, and 12 h (Fig. 2C and D). Except for an
abrupt increase at 60 μg/mL, ethidium fluorescence intensity
maintained the same levels as did untreated control cells for
all dosages at 6 h. We found no significant fluctuations in
O2
− content after 16 h of incubation. These results revealed
that the effect of PPI dendrimers on the intracellular ROS
content macrophages was dependent on the PPI dendrimer
generation. DAB 3.0 has more primary surface amine groups
than DAB 2.0 does and is more cytotoxic than DAB 2.0
is. Although cytotoxicity was not significantly different be-
tween DAB 2.0 and 3.0, there was a considerable and
generation-dependent difference in macrophage intracellular
ROS content.
3.3. Responses of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)
Unstable mitochondrial membrane potential and redox tran-
sitions have negatively affected cellular survival via mechan-
isms involving ROS-induced ROS release [18]. A fall in
mitochondrial membrane potential has usually been seen during
apoptosis initiated by mitochondria releasing cytochrome c,
whereas some studies have reported the reverse: respiring

trolled Release 120 (2007) 51–5956 J.S. Kuo et al. / Journal of Concells treated with dendrimers.We found no significant difference
in the subG1 phase (indicative of apoptotic cells) in cells
exposed and not exposed to dendrimers after 1 h of incubation
(Figs. 5 and 6). For longer incubation times, propidium iodide-
stained cells treated with DAB 2.0 and 3.0 showed a higher
subG1 phase than did untreated cells (Figs. 5 and 6), indicating
that a DNA cleavage occurred after the cells had been exposed
to dendrimers. DAB 3.0 compared to DAB 2.0 required lower
doses to obtain an apoptotic effect after 3 or 6 h of incubation.
Because the membranes of apoptotic cells were still intact,
our cell cycle analysis data did not contradict the cytotoxicity
assay data. Therefore, although the cells were viable according

by lower and upper circles, respectively.Fig. 5. Cell cycle analysis of U-937 macrophages treated with DAB 2.0.

trolother membrane-protected targets such as mitochondria. The
above observations imply a reasonable possibility that DAB
dendrimers interact with the mitochondrial membrane in
macrophages at later incubation times.
One hour after macrophages had been exposed to dendri-
mers, their cell size and complexity dramatically changed
(Fig. 4). DAB 3.0 produced more changes in cell size and
complexity than did DAB 2.0, and these findings were con-
sistent with the greater membrane disruption caused by other
high-generation cationic dendrimers [30]. Cationic nanospheres
formed particle-filled vacuoles after uptake into phagosomes
in RAW 264.7 macrophages [27]. This finding may explain
the increase of internal complexity (cytoplasmic granularity
and cell density) in Fig. 4. Our findings of changed cell size
and complexity were also supported by the changes of cell
morphology seen using scanning electron microscopy the cells
had been exposed to DAB dendrimers for 1 h [31].
Next, we investigated the cell cycle profiles of macrophages
treated with dendrimers. The increase observed in the subG1
population of cells treated with dendrimers at very short
incubation times (N3 h) indicated that apoptosis rapidly pro-
gressed. Although the changes in intracellular ROS generation
and mitochondrial membrane potential were different between
DAB 2.0 and 3.0, these changes contributed to the increases in
the subG1 population of cells treated with dendrimers, and this
marked the point of no return for apoptotic cells. After we
removed dendrimers from the culture medium and re-cultured
the cells for another 24 h, viability significantly decreased in
cells incubated with dendrimers for longer than 1 h (data not
shown). These results indicated that the changes of ROS
generation and mitochondrial membrane potential strongly
influenced cell proliferation and caused apoptosis in cells
incubated with dendrimers for longer than 1 h. However,
viability was well maintained and reached confluence after
3 days in cells incubated with dendrimers for 1 h and 20 min
(data not shown). This indicates that minor levels of oxidative
stress produced by dendrimers induce adequately protective
effects in cells.
Finally, we did not detect any TNF-α production in
macrophages treated with dendrimers (unpublished data). We
also found this in macrophages activated by cationic chitosan-
DNA nanoparticles [32]. Because proinflammatory effects are
regulated by the redox-sensitive MAP kinase and NF-κB
cascades, our results demonstrated that the regulation of these
pathways in dendrimer-activated macrophages did not lead to
proinflammatory cytokine production [27].
5. Conclusion
Although the concentrations of PPI dendrimers used in our
study were not cytotoxic, various intracellular responses in
dendrimer-treated macrophages still occurred time-dependently.
These intracellular responses—ROS content, mitochondria
membrane potential, cell size and complexity, and cell cycle
58 J.S. Kuo et al. / Journal of Conprofiles—are dependent on the dendrimer generation and stand
apart from the other particle types. The nature of interactions
between macrophages and PPI dendrimers is of greaterimportance for the design of safer and more effective delivery
systems for macrophages. Our findings contribute to a better
understanding of the molecular action of PPI dendrimers in the
cellular system.
