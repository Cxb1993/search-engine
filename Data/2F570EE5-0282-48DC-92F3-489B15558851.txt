Figure 1. ROV prototype composed of a water-proof metal body mounted on a pair of 
electrically driven tracks.  
 
The ROV under development is a small skid-steered tracked vehicle of approximate 
dimensions 100 × 75 × 50 cm. It will move at low speeds along a rough sediment bed, 
submerged underwater and in the presence of medium speed currents. It is to be controlled 
from the surface, using an insulated umbilical. Its purpose will be to characterize in detail live 
sediment beds using both passive sensors and active probes. The system will include three 
main components: 1) an electrically powered tracked underwater vehicle; 2) a measurement 
and control payload including motion sensors and a laser scanning system for the 
measurement of underwater topography; 3) a jetting system for the active probing of sediment 
beds.   
 
With support from the NSC, we have been able to develop the essential components of the 
vehicle platform and propulsion system. The specifications of the system are listed in Table 1. 
Development steps which have already been conducted are also illustrated on the figures

To guide the design, testing, and analysis of the ROV system, modeling efforts are conducted 
in parallel with system development and laboratory testing. A kinematic model is adopted to 
describe the vehicle motion and pose evolution as it travels over irregular topography. This 
model is necessary to interpret the inputs from the onboard camera and laser system. In vector 
form, the vehicle motion model is written

Underwater sand bed erosion and internal jump formation  
by travelling plane jets

Abstract 
Theory and experiments are used to investigate the water and sediment motion induced along 
a sea bed by travelling plane jets. Steadily moving jets are considered, and represent an 
idealization of the ship- and ROV-mounted tools used for injection dredging and trenching. 
The jet-induced turbulent currents simultaneously suspend sand from the bed and entrain 
water from the ambient. To describe these processes, a shallow flow theory is proposed in 
which the turbulent current is assumed stratified into sediment-laden and sediment-free 
sub-layers. The equations are written in curvilinear coordinates attached to the co-evolving 
bed profile. A sharp interface description is then adopted to account rigorously for mass and 
momentum exchanges between the bed, current, and ambient, including their effects on the 
balance of mechanical energy. Travelling wave solutions are obtained, in which the 
jet-induced current scours a trench of permanent form in a frame of reference moving with the 
jetting tool. Depending on the operating parameters, it is found that the sediment-laden 
current may remain supercritical throughout the trench, or be forced to undergo an internal 
hydraulic jump. These predictions are confirmed by laboratory experiments. For flows with or 
without jump in which the current remains attached to the bed, bottom profiles computed by 
the theory compare favourably with imaging measurements.  
 3
Although extensive testing and operational experience has been accumulated for jet trenching 
vehicles (see for instance Machin, 2001), the flow processes involved are not yet 
well-understood. Practical difficulties hindering such understanding include operation in 
difficult and turbid environments, as well as complicated patterns of water and sand motions.  
 
Motivated by these practical applications and complications, an idealized variant of the jet 
trenching problem is examined in the present study. We consider the action of a travelling 
plane jet, moving steadily along an initially horizontal sediment bed composed of uniform 
sand. By neglecting transverse variations and assuming that the flow pattern has attained a 
steady state in a frame of reference attached to the jetting tool, the general unsteady 
three-dimensional flow will be reduced to a two-dimensional steady flow that is more readily 
amenable to theoretical and experimental study. Because actual jet trenching operations 
involve powerful jets acting on beds of relatively fine material (fine to medium sand), 
turbulent suspension will be the only sediment pick-up and transport mechanism considered. 
To describe the water and sand motion induced by the travelling jets, a shallow flow theory 
will first be proposed. The predictions of the theory will then be checked against laboratory 
experiments conducted with carriage-mounted jets in a tank of constant width.  
 
The erosional action of water jets impinging on submerged sediment beds has been examined 
in a number of previous studies. Pioneering work was conducted by Rouse (1940), who 
carried out flume experiments with downwards plane jets and examined how the style and 
pace of scour hole development varied with jet strength and sediment characteristics. Over the 
last decades, extensive experimental work on erosion by fixed jets has been performed by 
Rajaratnam and co-workers (Rajaratnam, 1981; Aderibigbe & Rajaratnam, 1996; Mazurek et 
al., 2003), who examined plane and circular jets impinging at various angles of attack onto 
beds composed of different sediment materials. For jet-induced bedload transport, Hogg et al. 
 5
landslides (Chen et al., 2006). Finally, we will transform the governing equations to moving 
coordinates in order to describe the steady flows observed after long travel times in a frame of 
reference attached to the moving jets. 
 
The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we will derive our proposed sub-layered 
shallow flow equations. Section 3 will then be devoted to the construction of special 
travelling wave solutions to these general governing equations. Section 4 will delve into the 
flow and solution details that must be addressed in order to compute long profiles of the bed 
and current. Section 5 will describe the laboratory experiments performed to test the 
predictions of the theory. Detailed comparisons between computations and measurements will 
be presented in section 6. Finally, conclusions will be proposed in section 7.  
 
2. Sub-layered shallow flow theory 
2.1. Notations and assumptions 
The various notations and assumptions used to derive the theory are illustrated in Fig. 2. We 
consider the idealized situation sketched in Fig. 2a. A plane jet submerged in a deep quiescent 
ambient impinges onto a loose, stationary sediment bed, and we are interested in the ensuing 
pattern of water and sediment motion. Mean velocities are restricted to the x- and z-directions, 
and the flow is assumed uniform in the transverse direction. The jet-induced current takes the 
form of a turbulent bottom layer, flowing tangentially along the curved bed profile. Flow 
separation is not considered and the turbulent layer is assumed to remain attached to the 
stationary bed. Mass transfers occur both through the upper and lower boundaries of the 
turbulent current: quiescent water is entrained from the above ambient, and sand grains are 
eroded from the underlying bed. Sediment transport is taken to occur as suspended load, with 
eroded sand grains eventually falling back to the bed by gravitational settling.

 Wρρρ == ∞2 , (6) 
where Wρ  and Sρ  are the mass densities of water and sand, and where subscript ∞  is 
used to denote properties of the ambient. In what follows, the bed sand fraction 0n  and the 
densities 0ρ , 2ρ  and ∞ρ  will be assumed constant, but the sand fraction 1n  and the 
resulting density 1ρ  of the turbid sub-layer will be allowed to evolve in time and space. 
 
Contrasting with the stationary bed and quiescent ambient, the jet-induced turbulent current 
has a high velocity v, shared by the turbid and clear water sub-layers, and assumed to be 
oriented parallel to the local inclination of the stationary bed. The x- and z- components of the 
turbulent layer velocity are thus approximated by 
 )sin,cos(),( ββ vvuu zx −= . (7) 
Adopting a boundary-layer approximation, normal-to-bed components of the velocity will be 
disregarded in the balance of momentum and mechanical energy.  
 
2.2. Governing equations 
As illustrated in Fig. 2c, balance of volume, mass, and momentum can be applied to control 
volumes wrapped around the whole turbulent layer or around each sub-layer separately. 
Volume balance leads to the following continuity equations for the bed elevation )0(z , and 
the depths 1h  and 2h  of the two sub-layers:

momentum equation is needed, with only along-bed momentum considered. The 
corresponding balance equation is obtained for a control volume enclosing both sub-layers 
jointly, as illustrated in Fig. 2c. Neglecting non-hydrostatic effects, momentum balance in the 
normal-to-bed direction reduces to an expression for excess pressure (relative to a 
sediment-free hydrostatic water column)

The terms on the left-hand-side of this equation represent momentum change and flux, 
pressure thrust, and the along-bed component of the submerged weight. On the 
right-hand-side, terms )0(j  and )2(j  represent momentum transfers across the lower and 
upper boundaries separating the turbulent current from its underlying sediment bed and outer 
ambient. Upwards transfers are again defined positive. Equations (8)-(15) represent a 
generalisation of the classical Saint Venant equations of open-channel hydraulics (see e.g. 
Abbott, 1979). In the context of turbulent jets and boundary layers, the momentum equation 
equivalent to (15) is known as the Von Karman equation (see e.g. Mathieu and Scott, 2000).  
 
2.3. Interface transfer relations 
Let )(ye  denote volume transfer across a line parallel to the bed at normal coordinate y. We 
decompose the mass transfer )(yi  across the same line as the sum of a convective transfer 
associated with e and a mass drift ι  (iota) due to gravitational settling and correlated 
turbulent fluctuations: 
 11
stationary sediment bed below can oppose a resisting shear stress )0(0τ . If the mass flux 
)0(i  
is non-zero, the two shear stresses will not be equal to each other. Instead, they must satisfy a 
second compatibility condition 
 )0(1
)0()0(
0
)0( ττ −=−= vij .  (19) 
Here no convective term appears on the lower side of the interface because the velocity in the 
stationary bed is equal to zero. The two compatibility relations (18) and (19) are analogous to 
the Rankine-Hugoniot shock relations governing hydraulic jumps and bores. They represent a 
generalization of the morphodynamic interface relation used by Fraccarollo and Capart (2002) 
to relate erosion rate and shear stresses at the base of an erosional dam-break wave. In this 
earlier work, no mass drift was considered.  
 
For interface ),( )1()1( zx  separating the turbid and clear water sub-layers, we have 
 )1(2
)1(

)1(
1
)1( eei ριρ =+= , (20) 
where mass drift is absent on the right-hand-side because of the assumption that the top 
sub-layer is entirely sediment-free. Because the two sub-layers are assumed to share the same 
velocity v, no relation for the momentum flux )1(j  is required. Finally, for interface 
),( )2()2( zx  separating the turbulent layer and outer ambient, compatibility of the momentum 
flux requires

=−= τvij , (21) 
where )2()2(2
)2( eei
∞
== ρρ  and where )2(2τ  is the turbulent shear stress applied below the 
interface. There is no mass drift on either side because both the upper sub-layer and outer 
ambient are composed of water alone. Furthermore, the right-hand-side of (21) is zero 
because the outer ambient is assumed to be devoid of both current and turbulence. The mass 
drift and shear stress functions discussed above are illustrated in Fig. 2d.  
 
 13
both assumed to scale with the depth h  of the turbulent layer. The downwards gravitational 
drift, on the other hand, is expressed as the product of the local excess density with the 
normal-to-bed projection of the sediment settling rate ω . Due to hindered settling associated 
with the finite concentration of suspended sediment 1n  in the turbid layer, the effective 
settling rate ω  will be lower than the fall speed of individual sand grains in unbounded fluid 
(Richardson and Zaki, 1954). For the experiments described below, for instance, in which 
medium sand of diameter equal to 0.33 mm is used, the settling speed drops from 6 cm/s to 
2 cm/s when the sand concentration goes from 01 =n  to 3.01 =n . Within this range, the 
effective settling speed that best accounts for the observed trench response is found to be 
≈ω 3 cm/s.  
 
For the turbulent shear stress )0(1τ applied along the upper side of the stationary bed, we adopt 
the Chézy-type formula 
 vvf ||1
)0(
1 ρτ =  (26) 
applied by Kobayahsi and co-workers (2001, 2002) to the coastal surf and swash zones. 
Parameter f is a non-dimensional friction coefficient found by Raubenheimer et al. (2004) to 
take values in the range 06.002.0 −  for beach uprush and downrush (Dronkers, 2005). For 
the experiments described below, value ≈f 0.05, towards the higher end of this range, is 
found to be most appropriate. For the turbulent shear stress )2(2τ  applied on the inner side of 
the outer interface, the situation is close to free-shear turbulence, and we adapt the turbulent 
stress function used in standard one-equation turbulence models (Fredsøe and Deigaard, 
1992). By analogy with the Kolmogorov-Prandtl eddy viscosity expression kl=Tν , the 
shear stress function is written 
 )(2

where v−  is the velocity difference across the interface, and where non-dimensional

energy (per unit bed surface), and the second term on the left-hand-side is the divergence of 
the energy flux. Note that the potential energy is measured with respect to a ground state in 
which the settled sea bed rises to elevation 0)0( =z  below a sediment-free water ambient. 
Symbol γ  on the right-hand-side of equation (29) is the energy dissipation function. 
Assuming an isothermal system, the Second Law of Thermodynamics requires that this 
dissipation function be everywhere positive, i.e. 0≥γ  (see e.g. Abbott, 1979).  
 
In order to obtain a balance equation for the kinetic energy of the fluctuations alone, one can 
form the quasi-linear combination 
 (eq. 29) ×− 221 v (eq. 12) ×− mv (eq. 23) ×−+−− ∞∞ }cos/)(){( 11

After repeated application of the chain rule, a considerable amount of algebra, and 
right-hand-side substitutions based on the compatibility relations (18)-(21), the resulting 
equation simplifies to

which is one of the key results of the overall derivation. This equation is a balance law for the 
turbulence intensity k, where one can recognize on the right-hand side the following source 
and sink terms. The first two terms are production terms associated with the work of the mean 
flow against the interfacial shear stress )(abτ , and correspond to a loss of kinetic energy by the 
mean flow. The third term is a sink term associated with the work of the turbulent fluctuations 
against gravity, and corresponds to a gain of potential energy induced by the upwards mass 
drifts )(abι . Finally, the last term is the energy dissipation function, inherited from the overall 
balance of mechanical energy (29). It is seen from the right-hand-side of (31) that both the 
production and gravitational work contributions are rather naturally expressed in terms of the 
 17
 
Since 1h , )( 1 ∞− ρρ , ω , k , and ε  are positive, both the Knapp-Bagnold and turbulent 
dissipation terms are automatically greater or equal to zero. To guarantee overall dissipation, 
however, the first term must also be positive, i.e. 
 0)0(0 ≥vτ , (35) 
which amounts to requiring that the bed reaction shear stress must oppose velocity v. By 
virtue of interface relation (28), this places a constraint on the maximum mass drift that can 
be attained near the bed:

and this constraint will be enforced in the computations.  
 
3. Travelling wave solutions 
3.1. Equations in moving coordinates 
We now consider the case of a plane jet travelling along an initially horizontal sea bed. 
Approximating a steadily advancing injection dredge or jet trencher (see Fig. 1b,c), the jetting 
device is assumed to move at constant speed U to the left. To describe the resulting water flow 
and sand bed response, it is then convenient to postulate an observer moving with the jetting 
device at the same leftward speed U. The corresponding change of independent variables 
)ˆ,ˆ(),( txtx ↔  is given by 
 Utxx +=ˆ ,   tt =ˆ , (37) 
where xˆ  denotes horizontal distance from the origin of the travelling jet, as illustrated in Fig. 
3a. The associated curvilinear coordinate sˆ  is such that

endowed with a complete basis of six independent eigenvectors provided that 11 )( h∞− ρρ  is

because dredging and jet trenching tools often operate continuously over great distances, 
allowing the flow pattern that they induce to converge to steady state in a frame of reference 
attached to the jetting device. Such solutions are obtained by setting the time derivatives 
tˆ/ ∂∂  to zero in equations (41)-(46). In matrix form, the reduced system of equation can be 
written 
 SV =

J , (57) 
which represents a coupled system of 6 ordinary differential equations. Before integrating 
(57), we must first clarify the appropriate boundary conditions and consider the possible 
occurrence of critical sections where the matrix J  will be singular. 
 
For a horizontal sea bed, we anticipate that the jet-induced sediment motion will only take 
place over a finite distance behind the jetting device. Flowing to the right, the jet-induced 
current will dissipate energy until it is no longer able to sustain a sediment suspension. 
Consider the consequences of conservation equation (48), which at steady state reduces to 
 0}ˆ)(){(

To the left, in front of the jetting device, the undisturbed sea bed has elevation 0)0( =z , and 
0)( 11 =− ∞ hρρ  (no sediment is yet in suspension). Integration of (58) therefore yields the 
invariant 
 0ˆ)()( 11
)0(
0 =−+− ∞∞ vhUz ρρρρ  (59) 
Once jet-induced sediment transport occurs, therefore, 0ˆ)( 11 >− ∞ vhρρ  and the bed 
elevation will drop below the original sea bottom. Furthermore, it will remain below this level 
for as long as a suspended sediment flux is sustained. When this flux decreases, deposition 
will occur, and eventually the bed will recover its original elevation when all sediment motion 
has ceased. The temporary trench that is incised then backfilled in this fashion is precisely the 
objective of jet trenching, which seeks to bury the "product" (cable or pipeline) under a 
 23
system (57) from left to right, and proceed to the end of the trench if the flow is supercritical 
throughout. If the flow is transcritical, two additional difficulties must be addressed. First, 
means must be found to integrate through the discontinuous internal jump and through the 
singular critical section, assuming that their locations Jxˆ  and Cxˆ  are known. The more 
difficult issue, however, is that these locations are in fact unknown, and we must provide an 
additional internal boundary condition in order to close the problem. In the next section, we 
address these points one by one, starting with the specification of upstream boundary 
conditions.  
 
4. Flow and solution details 
4.1. Jet expansion before impingement 
We examine first the development of the pure water plane jet, before impingement onto the 
sand bed. A highly concentrated, point-like source of momentum is considered, located at 
horizontal position 0ˆ =x  and elevation Z above the unperturbed sea bed (Fig. 3a). This 
standoff elevation is taken to remain constant as the jetting device translates to the left. The jet 
is oriented at an angle α  below the horizontal, where o900 << α . The jet-induced water 
speed is assumed to be much larger than the travelling speed, Uv >> , and the influence of 
the latter is neglected at this stage (i.e. we approximate vv ≈ˆ ). Before impingement, the 
problem considered is thus the expansion of a neutrally buoyant turbulent jet in a quiescent 
ambient. This is a classical problem of turbulence research, which does not need to be solved 
anew, but it is useful to treat it using the equations derived above in order to clarify their

4.2. Trenching front 
A similar analysis can be applied to the trenching front, i.e. the zone immediately after jet 
impingement where erosion is most severe. In this zone, we can provisionally neglect density 
stratification and gravitational effects. For strong enough jets and typical values of the 
empirical parameters, the constraint (36) will be activated along the upstream part of the 
trenching front. An approximate, reduced set of governing equations analogous to (64)-(66)

which will be enforced in addition to the constraint (36), whichever is more restrictive.  
 
Away from the trenching front, both constraints (36) and (78) eventually become inactive. At 
that point, the evolution equation for the density of suspended sediment in the turbid layer 
becomes

which takes the form of a non-equilibrium relation and implies that, asymptotically, the 
density of the turbid layer will tend towards a density )( 0211 ∞+= ρρρ  intermediate 
between the densities of the underlying sediment bed and outer ambient. For the suspended 
sediment concentration 1n , the asymptotic result is 0211 nn → . Because of the upstream 
boundary conditions, constraints (36) and (78), and the lag distance needed for equilibration, 
however, the concentration will start from below and never quite reach this value. Value 
02
1
max,1 nn =  thus constitutes an upper bound for the suspended sediment concentration that 
can be attained in the turbid sub-layer. To account for these various competing effects, 
numerical solutions of the full governing equations will be required, and are presented further 
below. The partial and approximate results of this section will be used to check and help 
interpret the more complete computations.  
 
4.3. Internal hydraulic jump 
Under conditions examined further below, it may occur that the supercritical bottom current is 
not able to flow out of the scour hole it has itself incised without first undergoing an internal 
hydraulic jump (see Fig. 3b). In that case, the thin, fast turbulent layer will make a sharp 
transition to a thick, slow current. There must be a corresponding conversion of the kinetic 
energy of the mean flow to potential energy, with an associated energy loss that may be 
 29
governing the change in turbulence intensity kkk −′=][  across the jump. The first term on 
the right hand side of (84) is a production term associated with the mechanical energy lost by 
the mean flow, and constitutes a generalization of the dissipation formula for classical 
hydraulic jumps and bores (Stoker, 1957). The second term on the right hand side, Γ , 
denotes the rate of dissipation of the total mechanical energy (mean flow + turbulent 
fluctuations), by processes acting locally within the jump. We will neglect this term and 
simply set 0=Γ .  
 
Whereas the flow thickness h on the upstream side of the jump is much smaller than both the 
trench depth H and its local radius of curvature R, this is not true on the downstream side of 
the jump, where RHh ~~ . As a result, the curvilinear description no longer applies, and we 
revert to a Cartesian view for the region Jxx ˆˆ >  downstream of the jump. In this region, we 
further apply the small slope approximation 
 ββ tansin ≈ ,   1cos ≈β . (85) 
To insure compatibility of the pressure thrust terms, which dominate on the downstream side 
of the jump, assumption (85) will be adopted for the shock relations as well. With this 
precision, equations (81), (82), (84) provide a complete set of relations allowing one to 
compute the conjugate state downstream of the jump based on the known upstream state. The 
matter of determining the jump position Jxˆ , however, is left unresolved, and will be 
addressed in the next subsection together with the critical section.  
 
4.4. Passage through the critical section 
If the sediment-laden bottom current undergoes an internal hydraulic jump, then of necessity 
it must pass through a critical section before reaching the end of the trench. Let Cxˆ  be the 
location of this critical section, where the local Froude number takes the precise value 1ˆ =rF  
on the way back from sub- to supercritical flow. Where 1ˆ =rF , however, the Jacobian matrix

where the small slope approximation (85) was invoked. Equations (89) and (90) show that the 
suspended sediment concentration remains constant, and that the bed profile takes a constant 
adverse slope controlled by the ratio of the settling rate ω  to the travelling speed U. 
Assuming a small Froude number, one can furthermore neglect the first term before the 
second term on the left hand side of the reduced equation of motion (91), and approximate

As illustrated in Fig. 3c, this approximate solution represents a turbid pool characterized by a 
nearly horizontal turbidity interface 1
)0()1( hzz += , from which water is detrained and 
suspended sediment settles back to the bed. The depth 1h  of the turbid sub-layer decreases 
approximately linearly with distance, until all suspended sediment has re-deposited and the 
trench ends. In the more complete description, the turbulence intensity will remain non-zero 
for some distance downstream of the jump, delaying this backfill process.  
 
4.5. Numerical solutions 
Although the above developments show that partial information can be obtained 
semi-analytically, solutions to the full governing equations must be sought numerically. 
Consider first the situation in which no jump is present. Integration of system (57) can then 
proceed from left to right, starting from the known conditions IVV =  at the impingement 
point. For this purpose, an explicit second-order Runge-Kutta scheme is used, advancing from 
curvilinear position sˆ  to position ss ˆˆ ∆+  in the two successive sub-steps

The equilibrated jump position sought is therefore such that 0)ˆ( =JxG , and the problem 
becomes one of finding, if it exists, the root Jxˆ  of the solvability function G. This function 
takes negative values near impingement, rises in the downstream direction, then decreases 
again, taking a maximum )ˆ(maxmax JxGG =  at a certain candidate jump location 
)ˆ(argmaxˆ max, JJ xGx = . If 0max >G , then a jump is possible in the interval max,ˆˆˆ JJI xxx << . 
The function )ˆ( JxG  is found to be monotonous in this interval, hence it is straightforward to 
find the simple root Jxˆ  using bisection. Once this root has been found, one can continue the 
left-to-right integration past the critical section until the end of the trench is reached. 
 
The conditions under which admissible solutions with and without jumps can be constructed 
can thus be summarized as follows. A fully supercritical profile (without jump) is such that 
1min >F . An admissible transcritical profile (with an internal jump along the way), on the 
other hand, is such that 0max >G . Depending on the jet and sand properties, it turns out that 
three cases are possible. For certain values of the governing parameters, 1min >F  and 
0max <G , implying that only the fully supercritical profile is admissible. For other values, 
1min <F  and 0max >G , which means that only the solution with a jump is admissible. Finally, 
there is a domain of overlap where both 1min >F  and 0max >G , implying that both the 
solutions with and without jump are admissible. In that case, the travelling profiles adopted by 
the flow at steady state are not determined by the governing parameters alone, but depend on 
the full unsteady history of the flow.  
 
Examples of computed profiles for these three cases are presented in Figures 4, 5, and 6. For 
all cases, the model parameters are set to the values appropriate for the small-scale 
experiments described in the next section. Material parameters take values 2670=Sρ  kg/m3 
 35
the absence of gravity effects is plotted as a dash-dotted line on panel 4a. To compute this 
profile, the density of the turbid layer was given the constant value )( max,1min,1211 ρρρ += , 
intermediate between the minimum possible density Wρρ =min,1  and the maximum value 
)( 021max,1 Wρρρ += . As expected, the computed trenching front and its semi-analytical 
approximation agree with each other upstream, then diverge when gravity and sediment 
settling start to affect the computed bed profile. In the upstream part of the trenching front, 
close to the point of impingement, the bed profile features a steep inclination that approaches, 
but does not attain, the maximum allowed inclination =+ δα 67 degrees. Such steep 
inclinations provide the motivation for the curvilinear formulation adopted in the present 
work.  
 
The other two panels of Figure 4 show how the other variables evolve along the trench profile. 
The velocity v  of the turbulent current and the square root k  of its turbulence intensity 
are plotted in panel 4b. As suggested by the semi-analytical similarity approximation (73), the 
velocity decreases roughly with the inverse of the square root of the along-bed distance, i.e. 
sv ˆ/1∝ . This slowdown is the direct result of erosion and entrainment, which both induce 
mixing of the high-velocity turbulent current with initially motionless bed material and 
ambient water. Fast equilibration of production and dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy 
likewise lead to the scaling sk ˆ/1∝ , implying the approximate proportionality Cvk ≈ . 
Panel 4c, finally, shows the evolution of the sediment concentration 1n   in the turbid 
sub-layer. As anticipated based on equation (79), this sand concentration rapidly converges 
from its value 01 =n  at the point of impingement of the pure water jet towards its 
asymptotic maximum value 021max,1 nn = , shown as a dash-dotted line in the same panel.  
 
Figure 5 shows corresponding plots for a slower speed of advance, set to value =U 3 cm/s, 
 37
overlap, and solutions with and without a jump can both be constructed. Panel 6a shows the 
flow pattern computed under the assumption that no jump forms, while panel 6b shows the 
resulting profiles when a jump is introduced. Both flows represent admissible steady state 
solutions for the exact same model and operating parameters. The resulting profiles are 
therefore strictly identical in their upstream portion, where the flow is supercritical. Panel a 
shows how the supercritical profiles can be continued to the end of the trench without any 
regime transition. The current gradually expands, but remains thin throughout the erosion and 
deposition process. Panel b, on the other hand, shows the alternative steady profiles obtained 
when an internal jump is allowed to form. The flow then undergoes a sudden expansion at the 
jump, with the turbid sub-layer invading the whole depth of the trench. Eventually, however, 
the suspended sand settles back to the bed which rises back to its original level. Due to the 
local turbulence enhancement associated with the jump, scour on panel b reaches slightly 
deeper than on panel a, but the resulting trench length is shorter.  
 
In the literature, the possible co-existence of two possible steady states, with and without 
jump, is known to occur for other types of shallow flows. This includes the case of single 
layer flow over a moving obstacle described by Baines (1995). We find here that the same 
situation occurs for erosional bottom currents induced by moving plane jets. To summarize, 
the present shallow flow theory predicts that the jet-induced flow will take the form of a 
shooting current for high enough speeds of advance. As this speed is decreased, the jet will 
incise a deeper trench, inside which the flow may or may not undergo an internal jump. If the 
speed is decreased further, the sediment-laden flow becomes forced to go through a jump. 
These general predictions of the theory, as well as the more specific features of the computed 
profiles, must now be checked against laboratory observations.  
 
 39
heads is made to attain a more uniform span-wise distribution of jetting strength. In earlier 
tests, we found that we could not achieve the desired degree of uniformity with a single head 
spanning the entire tank width. The high-pressure water for the three heads comes from a 
three-way flow splitter, fed by a twin-piston irrigation pump. The pump is equipped with an 
air chamber to make the water supply very nearly steady, and its discharge can be adjusted to 
values up to Q = 125 mℓ/s.  
 
To move the jetting device along the bed, a motor-driven traverse is placed above the tank, 
and travels at a constant speed U that can be set in the range U = 2−10 cm/s. An articulated 
arm mounted rigidly on the carriage is used to position the jets above to the sand surface. The 
connection between the arm and the jetting tool is a three-degrees-of-freedom wrist used to 
adjust the jetting orientation. Precise adjustment is required to achieve a laterally symmetric 
erosion pattern. A slight asymmetry of the impinging jets can be amplified by the eroding 
flow into a tilted sand surface of up to 30 degrees sideways inclination. For all the 
experiments presented below, the jet orientation was set to =α 60 degrees, and the standoff 
distance of the nozzles above the undisturbed bed was set to =Z 5 mm. Three jetting 
discharges =Q  90, 107 and 122 mℓ/s were examined, corresponding to jetting strengths 
=Σ1 5.8 ℓ/s
2, =Σ 2 8.1 ℓ/s
2, and =Σ3 10.6 ℓ/s
2. For each discharge, tests were performed at 
various speeds of advance U. Further tests conducted with another standoff distance 
=Z 10 mm are described in Perng (2006).  
 
5.2. Sand properties 
The sand material used for the tests is a medium quartz sand of density =Sρ 2670 kg/m3, 
median diameter =50d  0.33 mm, and coefficient of uniformity =1060 / dd 2.0. The 
volumetric sand concentration in the static sedimented bed is estimated to be in the range 0.58 
<< 0n  0.62, with value =0n 0.60 retained for the computations. In order to constrain the 
 41
 
5.3. Profile measurements and flow observations 
With reference to Figures 7 and 9, experiments proceed as follows. The jetting tool is first 
positioned at one end of the tank, at the desired inclination and standoff distance above the 
horizontal bed. Carriage motion is then initiated, and shortly thereafter the pump is started. 
The ensuing bed erosion and sand suspension are observed through the tank sidewall. After 
travelling some distance along the bed, a stable flow pattern and scour hole shape become 
established, which translate to the left with the jetting tool without significant further 
deformation. As required by conservation of sediment mass (neglecting variations in 
sedimented sand concentration before and after trenching), the scour hole travelling to the left 
leaves behind a sand heap in the start-up region, with equivalent positive and negative 
volumes on either side of the initial horizontal bed profile. The experiment ends when the 
jetting tool reaches the opposite end of the tank, when both the carriage and pump are 
stopped.  
 
The time-lapse photographs of Fig. 9 are obtained with a professional digital camera mounted 
on a tripod. The camera is fitted with a low distortion wide angle lens, capturing the entire 
tank length, and oriented with the image plane parallel to the tank walls. Intervals of 2 
seconds separate the successive images shown in Fig. 9, but the acquisition is performed at 
the faster rate of one image per second. To permit quantitative comparison with the 
computations, longitudinal profiles are extracted from these images using manual mouse 
clicks, then converted to physical coordinates using a calibrated scale factor and rotation 
adjustment. Coordinates in the travelling frame of reference are obtained by measuring 
distances with respect to a moving origin chosen as the position of the nozzle closest to the 
sidewall, projected vertically down onto the initial sediment bed profile.

elevation. All along this course, the suspended sand current remains confined to a thin layer 
flowing rapidly along the bed.  
 
As illustrated in Fig. 11b, a deeper scour hole and a strikingly different flow pattern can be 
observed at slower speeds of advance. Along the upstream trenching front close to the jetting 
tool, the current is again thin compared to the trench depth. At some point, however, the 
bottom current thickens dramatically, with the suspended sand layer adopting a thickness that 
exceeds the scour depth, and with a corresponding sudden slow down of the longitudinal flow 
velocity. At the sudden expansion, a strong counter-clockwise circulation is observed in the 
upper portion of the current, with a smaller clockwise circulation bubble observed near the 
bed. These are the hallmark features associated with a strong internal hydraulic jump. 
Downstream of this jump, the flow gradually quiets down, with the suspended sand settling 
back to the bed in a manner reminiscent of the settling column observations, with distance 
from the jump replacing time elapsed as the independent variable governing the pace of 
re-sedimentation.  
 
6. Comparison of theory and experiments 
6.1. Longitudinal profiles and trench depth 
To make the comparisons quantitative, Figures 12 and 13 show computed and observed 
profiles for low and high values of the jetting strength Σ , respectively. For each jetting 
strength, results for four different speeds of advance U  are shown, and ordered from fast to 
slow speeds on panels a-d. As predicted, both series feature purely shooting flows for high 
speeds of advance (Fig. 12a,b and Fig. 13a), but exhibit internal hydraulic jumps for slower 
speeds (Fig. 12c,d and Fig. 13b-d). In all cases, computed profiles are in reasonably good 
qualitative and quantitative agreement with the measurements.  
 
 45
))ˆ(max( )0( xzH −= . As noted previously, this depth tends to increase for higher jetting 
strengths and slower speeds of advance. In Fig. 14, data points from runs with and without a 
hydraulic jump are plotted using filled and hollow symbols respectively, with different 
symbol shapes associated with the three jetting strengths tested =Σ1 5.8 ℓ/s
2, =Σ 2 8.1 ℓ/s
2, 
and =Σ3 10.6 ℓ/s
2. For comparison, calculated curves for the internal jump case and purely 
shooting flow case are plotted as solid and dashed lines respectively. For intermediate speeds 
of advance, both types of solution are admissible and the two sets of curves overlap.  
 
The obtained relationship between trench depth and speed of advance features a break of 
trend at the transition between regimes with and without jumps. In the absence of internal 
jump, the trench depth varies roughly with the inverse of the speed of advance (dashed lines 
and hollow symbols). A deeper trench results when the sand bed is exposed longer to the 
erosive action of the jet. Although the trench depth continues to increase for the slower speeds 
of advance at which an internal hydraulic jump forms (solid lines and filled symbols), the 
corresponding depths are lower than would be expected from extrapolating to the left the 
inverse relation observed for the shooting flows. This indicates that the internal jump tends to 
curtail the trench depth that would otherwise be reached in its absence. Overall, the observed 
and computed depths are in reasonable agreement with each other over the range of jetting 
strengths and speeds of advance considered.  
 
The level of agreement obtained in Figures 12 to 14 is significant, because all computations 
are performed under the exact same values of the model parameters. Among these parameters, 
tuning was required only for the friction factor f (set to value =f 0.05), and for the effective 
settling speed (set to value =ω 3 cm/s), all other constitutive constants being obtained from 
either generic experiments (e.g. plane jet spreading rates) or standard material tests. Also, 
although the results are quite sensitive to the precise choice of f and ω , the tuned values fall 
 47
vertical two-dimensional treatment. 
 
To summarize the above findings, computations and observations of the domain of occurrence 
of various flow regimes are represented in Fig. 16 as a phase diagram. The two governing 
parameters examined are the speed of advance U and jetting strength Σ , with other 
parameters kept constant. The experimentally observed flows are classified into three groups: 
shooting flows (hollow symbols) observed at high speeds of advance to the right of the 
diagram; flows with an internal hydraulic jump (filled symbols) observed at moderate speeds 
of advance; and separated flows (algebraic symbols), observed at very low speeds.  
 
On the same diagram, lines are used to delineate the domains of admissibility of solutions 
with and without jump, as computed on the basis of our shallow flow theory. The solid line 
denotes condition 0max =G  which, for a given jetting strength, represents the fastest speed 
of advance at which a jump may form. The dashed line denotes condition 1min =F , which 
likewise represents the slowest speed of advance at which the flow can remain supercritical 
throughout the trench. The sector comprised between these two curves represents the domain 
of overlap in which both types of solutions are admissible.  
 
Agreement between theory and experiments requires that only hollow symbols (shooting 
flows) be observed to the right of the solid line, and that only black symbols (flows with 
internal jumps) be found to the left of the dashed line, with both types of symbols allowed 
inside the sector of overlap (where both flow patterns can theoretically occur). The 
observations are found to be consistent with these domain predictions. Nevertheless, a third 
regime of flow occurs in the experiments at low speeds of advance (algebraic symbols), in 
which the flow separates from the bed and the theory breaks down.  
 
 49
can be taken into account. The treatment can further be extended to steep, but gradually 
curved profiles, by using curvilinear coordinates. Provided shallow flow theory is extended in 
this fashion, the key notions of classical hydraulics become applicable to the jet trenching 
problem. This includes a precise identification of supercritical and subcritical regimes, along 
with their transitions through hydraulic jumps and control sections. Most importantly, the 
resulting qualitative and quantitative predictions turn out to be in reasonably good agreement 
with laboratory experiments. Shooting flows and internal jump flow patterns are indeed 
observed, and their profiles and range of occurrence are in accord with the shallow flow 
computations.  
 
Nevertheless, the present results are subject to a number of restrictive limitations. First, 
experimental test of the theory was limited to a narrow range of conditions, featuring a single 
jetting geometry and only one sand size. We expect the range of observable behaviour to 
expand significantly if more varied conditions are examined, stretching the ability of the 
theory to keep up. Secondly, even for the limited range of conditions examined in the present 
experiments, some significant flow features fall clearly outside the scope of the proposed 
theory. For plane jets travelling slowly along the bed, gravity-induced breaching occurs ahead 
of jet impingement, while further into the trench the jet-induced current undergoes a strong 
deflection away from the bed. This occurrence of breaching and separation at low speeds of 
advance suggests that, paradoxically, the case of stationary erosional jets is less amenable to 
theoretical treatment than the case of moving jets examined in the present work.  
 
Finally, the configuration examined in the present paper is far simpler that the conditions of 
interest in actual trenching and dredging operations. Challenges encountered in practice 
include three-dimensional water and sediment motions, more complex soil responses affected 
by cohesion, sorting, and liquefaction, and seafloors featuring varied bathymetry such as

travelling jetting heads and induced flow pattern.  
Figure 8. Sedimentation column tests: a) measured settling rates w (filled circles) for various 
sediment concentrations n, compared with the fall speed of individual sand grains (hollow 
symbol, mean of 20 measurements); b) definition sketch. Tests performed in water near 
30°C. 
Figure 9. Time-lapse images of a jet trenching experiment from start-up (top panel) until 
approximate convergence to a moving trench of permanent shape (bottom panel). 
Successive panels are separated by intervals of 2 seconds. Each black or white segment of 
the scale bar is 5 cm long. Conditions for this test are =Σ 8.1 ℓ/s2 (medium jetting 
strength) and U = 6.8 cm/s (high speed of advance, leading to a shooting flow pattern). 
Figure 10. Profile measurements: a) bed profile (filled circles) and outer limit of suspended 
sediment (hollow circles) acquired manually from a digital image; b) successive unsteady 
bed profiles (thin lines), converging towards a permanent shape approximated by the last 
profile (thick line) near the end of the experiment (for clarity, vertical scale distorted by a 
factor of 2). The example chosen is the test run shown previously in Fig. 9. 
Figure 11. Close-up photographs of the flow patterns established downstream of the moving 
plane jet: a) shooting flow example; b) internal jump example.  
Figure 12. Comparison of observed and computed profiles for low jetting strength 
=Σ 5.8 ℓ/s2 at various speeds of advance: a) =U  4.0 cm/s; b) =U  3.5 cm/s; c) =U  
2.9 cm/s; d) =U  2.4 cm/s. Filled circles = measured bed profile; hollow circles = 
measured outer limit of suspended sediment; curves = computed profiles for the bed
