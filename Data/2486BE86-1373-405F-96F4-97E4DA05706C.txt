hand, male and user with walker using experience 
exerted significantly larger vertical force than

Abstract: Research about walkers have often 
suggested that safety and assistance for elders 
with weak low limb is important. However, the 
relationship between walker using and upper 
limb is hardly mentioned. The movements of 
standing up and sitting down are also important 
daily activities. Therefore, the aim of this study 
attempted to explore what the wrist deviation 
and vertical force among elderly individuals 
using a walker for assistance to stand up and sit 
down are. 64 elderly volunteers (mean age = 
80.22, SD = 9.36) were recruited to conduct the 
experiment. The collected data obtained from 4 
load cells and a twin-Axial Goniometer of wrist 
were analyzed by one-mean t test, ANOVA and 
the Pearson product–moment correlation in 
order to figure out the wrist deviation and 
vertical force when elders used a walker with 
horizontal handles to assist in standing up and 
sitting down. Results of this study showed that 
significant wrist deviation were presented during 
walker using, the dorsal flexion of right hand 
larger than that of left hand, male and user with 
walker using experience exerted significantly 
larger vertical force than female and those 
without walker using experience did, 
respectively. During sitting position the users 
presented larger ulnar deviation, however, 
during standing position user turned into 
presenting larger dorsal flexion. The findings 
might be of importance in implicating that the 
horizontal handles of the most of marketed 
walkers might be the cause of user’ wrist 
deviations, as well as in providing researchers to 
search for improvements in walker design.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, the proportion of older people in 
the population is expanding faster than the 
younger ones within developed countries. In 
Asia, North America, and Europe, 6% to 15% of 
the population is now older than 65 years. By 
2030, this range is expected to increase to 
between 12% and 24% (Fisk, Rogers, Charness, 
Czaja, & Sharit, 2004). In Taiwan, 8.8% of the 
population is older than 65 in 2001, and this 
number would be 10.6% in 2009 (Department of 
Statistics, 2009) a. 
Department of Statistics (2009)b reported 
that 37.02% of the 1,070,000 people with 
disabilities are older than 65. Recently, loss of 
physiological function for older people has been 
increased noticeably (Paterson, Jones, & Rice, 
2007). A lot of research works have stated that 
these symptoms might not be treated medically 
or surgically (e.g., Glassa, 2007; Huang, 2005; 
Semsei, 2000). These changing in demographics 
are resulting in an increasing demand for 
assistive devices, especially for the elderly 
population. Besides canes and crutches, walkers

2. Method 
2.1 Participants 
Gay (1992) suggested the number of 
participants involved in causal–comparative 
studies and correlational studies should be at 
least 30. In this study, 63 volunteers were 
enrolled through an advertisement posted at the 
Taipei Zhi-Shan Senior Center and Huai-Tzu 
Nursing home. Based on walker-use experience, 
the individuals were divided into two groups: 31 
experienced participants who were 
independently using walkers frequently, ages 62 
to 101 years (M = 82.5, SD = 8.6), and 32 
non-experienced participants who could walk 
independently, ages 63 to 96 years (M = 78.1, 
SD = 9.7). Informed consent was obtained from 
each participant after a full explanation of the 
experimental project and its procedures was 
provided. All participants were retired and were 
right-hand and right-leg dominant as defined by 
their preferred limb for writing and kicking, 
respectively. Each received a gift for 
participation. 
2.2 Experimental Devices 
2.2.1 Experimental walker.—A standard walker 
(Fig. 1) constructed of aluminum, width 52 cm, 
adjustable height 72–82 cm, handle length 23 
cm, and weight 4 kg was used to perform the 
experimental tasks (Fig. 1). 
 
Fig 1.  The layout of experimental setting 
2.3 Measurement Devices 
2.3.1 Load cell.—A load cell (JIHSENSE S100) 
was installed on each foot of the experimental 
walker (four cells in total). A load cell is an 
electronic device (transducer) used to convert 
force into electrical signals. This conversion is 
indirect and occurs through a mechanical 
arrangement; the force being sensed deforms a 
strain gauge. 
2.3.2 Twin-axis wrist goniometer (SG 65).—The 
twin-axis goniometer simultaneously measures 
wrist movements in two axes. The endblocks of 
the SG 65 goniometer are attached to the dorsal 
surface of the forearm using double-sided tape, 
with one end over the third metacarpal and the 
other over the midline of the forearm (Fig. 1). 
The goniometer has two separate output 
connectors; the first measures wrist 
flexion/extension, and the second measures 
radial/ulnar deviation. 
2.4 Task Specification 
The experiment was conducted in a single 
session for each participant and lasted 
approximately 10 min. Data were collected 
using the measurement devices discussed. All 
participants were tested individually in a quiet 
room with an ambient temperature of 
approximately 25°C. The height, weight, and 
larger trochanter height of each participant was 
measured before the experiment. The researcher 
adjusted the walker height according to each 
participant’s trochanter height. Participants were 
asked to put their palms on top of the table and 
to keep their wrists in a neutral position (angle 
0°). Wrist goniometer were attached to the 
dorsal surface of the forearm with tape. At the 
beginning of the experiment, the researcher 
instructed the participants to stand up and sit 
down twice using the walker on a hard floor. 
Participants started in the sitting posture, and 
were asked to use the walker handle for 
assistance when rising from the chair to an 
upright standing position. After maintaining this 
posture for 10 sec., they were asked to use the 
walker handle to assist sitting down and then to 
lean against the back support of the chair. 
Participants practiced the sequence twice prior 
to measuring and recording the results. A 
computer was used to simultaneously record 
wrist angle and vertical force data from the 
shape sensors and load cells, respectively, at 
1000 Hz. For safety reasons, a registered nurse 
was present for all trials. 
2.5 Data Analysis 
Regarding standing up, 3 time points were 
5 
(UM: 33.12°, US: 29.63°) resulted in greater 
ulnar deviation than did the sitting movement 
(DM: 28.46°, DI: 22.71°). 
During standing movement, ulnar deviation 
during UM/DM (33.12°) was not significantly 
different from that during UI/DS (35.49°) or 
during US/DI (29.63°). However, the UI/DS 
showed significantly greater ulnar deviation than 
did US/DI (29.63°). During sitting movement, 
the greatest ulnar deviation occurred in UI/DS 
(35.14°), followed by UM/DM (28.46°) and 
US/DI (22.71°). 
Hand showed ulnar deviation during 
standing up and sitting down. During standing 
movement, the post hoc test (Table 3) showed 
ulnar deviation was greater for the left (34.30°) 
than for the right hand (31.20°). However, 
during sitting movement, the opposite was 
observed, with ulnar deviation significantly 
greater (30.40°) for the right than for the left 
hand (27.14°). Ulnar deviation in the left hand 
differed according to movement type, with 
greater deviation during standing up (34.28°) 
than during sitting down (27.14°). However, no 
difference was observed for the right hand. 
TABLE 3 
Simple Main Effects of Ulnar Deviation 
 
Abbreviations are as follows: movement types: sitting 
down (D), standing up (U); movement phases: sitting 
position (UI/DS), ascending/descending (UM/DM), 
standing position (US/DI); hand: left (L), right (R). 
*p<.05. 
Table 2 also shows the results for 
dorsiflexion. No interaction was observed 
among phase, hand, and movement, and no main 
effect of hand was found. The main effects of 
phase and movement were statistically 
significant. The post hoc test showed, on 
average, greater dorsiflexion occurred during 
moving (21.86°) and standing (22.14°) 
compared with sitting (16.24°), and also showed 
greater dorsiflexion for the right (22.31°) than 
for the left hand (17.85°). 
The assessment of vertical force (Table 2) 
revealed no interaction between movement and 
phase and no main effect of movement. The 
main effect of movement phase was significant. 
The post hoc test showed the greatest vertical 
force (64.04 N) occurred during moving, 
followed by standing (47.67 N), and the least 
was observed during sitting (37.16 N). 
3.3 Sex and Experience Using a Walker on 
Wrist Deviation and Vertical Force 
ANOVA revealed that there were no 
interaction effects between gender and using 
experience (Table 4). Regarding ulnar deviation, 
the main effect of gender (p < 0.0001) and 
walker using experience (p < 0.0001) were 
significant. Female participants (32.15°) had 
larger ulnar deviation than male (29.85°) does. 
Experienced participants (33.52°) have larger 
ulnar deviation than non- experienced 
participants (28.48°) had. 
Table 4 also showed the results for dorsal 
flexion, there was no main effect of walker 
using experience. The main effect of gender (p < 
0.0001) was significant. Male participants 
(21.99°) had larger dorsal flexion than female 
(18.11°) had. 
Regarding vertical force, the main effect of 
gender (p < 0.0001) and walker using 
experience were significant. Male participants 
(54.92 N) had larger vertical force than female 
(44.06 N) had. Experienced participants (55.69 
N) had larger vertical force than non- 
experienced (43.29 N) had.

of wrist deviation during walker using. Up to 
this point, these results are consistent with those 
of lots of researches (e.g., Giuliani, et al., 2008, 
Daniels, et al., 2004): High repetitive 
movements with wrist deviation can result in 
injury to bone or muscle, e.g., carpal tunnel 
syndrome (CTS). Several studies (Kong, Jang, 
& Freivalds, 2006, Bridger, 2005) have noted 
that wrists should remain in as a neutral position 
as possible during hand movement because this 
could prevent damage caused by highly 
repetitive and inaccurate movement. With 
walker using involving repetitive movements 
(Aikaterini, & Tianjian, 2005) in mind, we can 
inference with certainty that with the wrist 
deviation presenting, walker using possibly 
causes cumulative disorder symptom. Therefore, 
minimizing wrist deviation among walker users 
is important 
Finally, the conclusion drawn above would 
be interpreted in relation to walker handle 
design. The horizontal handle indeed causes 
wrist deviation no matter what the gender is, and 
what the walker using experience is, and the 
weight indeed affects vertical force. These 
findings are in line with previous studies, and 
can provide more detail about this issue. Future 
research is obviously required, an additional 
interesting avenue of investigation might be to 
consider whether the situation in operation the 
walker during walking, although we have 
investigated walker using during standing up 
and sitting down, we believe much more 
research work is still needed to search for 
improvements in walker design.
