Abstract—An improved detection method for observing the
zero quantized block (ZQB) is proposed. The additional com-
putational cost would be reduced due to 4 × 4 ZQBs being
detected prior to the 4 × 4 DCT forward transform and the
quantization processes on H.264/AVC video coder, we report a
new criterion based on the statistical analysis by considering
the energy conservation theorem. Experiments are also carried
out to validate the present method. The results indicate that
the present method has both a better detection rate with
the negligible PSNR degradation and a reasonable error
and/or false detection comparing to the prevalent methods.
Particularly, computation savings are obtained as well.

I. INTRODUCTION
H.264/MPEG4 Part 10 advance video coding(H.264/AVC)
provides a number of advances in video coding techniques.
H.264 can achieve better performance in both the coding
efficiency and the visual quality than previous standards
such as MPEG-1/2/4 and H.261/263 [1], [2], and [3]. As
far as the low bit-rate coding is concerned, i.e., a higher
quantization parameter (QP) for encoding, a large amount
of 4×4 residual blocks after transform (DCT) / quantization
(Q) will be considered as zero-quantized blocks (ZQBs) with
sixteen zero quantized coefficients. Consequently, if ZQBs
can be predicted, the computation of DCT/Q is skipped and
the computational complexity is reduced as well.
Several efforts focused on an issue of detecting ZQBs
[4], [5],and [6]. Sousa [5] proposed the early detection
algorithms used for the 8×8 DCT-based video encoder such
as H.263. In [4], an improved detection algorithm has shown
the higher detection rate and more computation savings than
[5] based on theoretical analyses. Wang et al. [6] have
analyzed the dynamic range of DCT coefficients and further
have derived the condition for detecting the ZQBs.
Particularly, other approaches used the characteristic of
the input residual data of DCT with statistical model to
predict ZQBs. Pao et al. [7] addressed that the correlation
of the residual pixel values after the motion-compensated
prediction could be obtained approximately by use of a
Laplacian distribution. Similarly, Wang et al. [8] extended
Pao’s results to present a hybrid method applying in H.264.
In [9], a ZQB detection method was presented based on
the energy conservation theorem and the rate-distortion of
Gaussian distribution. Therefore, Xie’s method was superior
to the existing methods in terms of the detection accuracy
and the complexity of motion estimation.
In this paper, our detection method for ZQB is derived
with respect to the analyses of DCT coefficients. Experimen-
tal results show that the average detection rate obtained by
using our method is superior to other detection algorithms
with negligible visual degradations. The remainder of this
paper is organized as follows. Both the background of the
integer discrete cosine transform of H.264/AVC and the
overview of the ZQB early detection methods are reviewed
in Section II. The preliminary work for DCT coefficients
and the proposed method are presented in Section III.
Experimental results are shown in Section IV to compare
the proposed method with the comparative methods. Con-
clusions are given in Section V.
II. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW
A. Integer-DCT Transform and Quantization
H.264 adopts the 4 × 4 integer DCT transform to avoid
the mismatch problem caused by the inverse transform [10]
and [11]. Given a 4 × 4 residual block X , i.e., X =
{f(m,n)| 0 ≤ m,n ≤ 3}, the transform coefficients,
F = {F (u, v)|0 ≤ u, v ≤ 3}, can be calculated by the
following form:
F = AXAT = (CXCT )⊗ PF =W ⊗ PF (1)

by CXCT . PF is a post-scaling factor. The symbol ⊗

in the same position in PF . Given a quantization parameter,

B. Proposed Method for ZQB Detection
Determining the largest magnitude of DCT coefficients,
FMAX , of a 4 × 4 block is an important part for early
detecting the ZQBs. In order to investigate the distribution
of DCT coefficients, we first analyzed six CIF( 352× 288)
video sequences, (’Akiyo’, ’Coastguard’, ’Foreman’, ’News’,
’Silent’, and ’Table Tennis’), with different QPs (18, 24, 30,
36, 40, and 46). As shown in Table I, a 4× 4 DCT block is
divided into the four locations Loc(i) separately and the DC
coefficient locates in Loc(0). We define the probability of
the largest of DCT coefficients occurred in Loc(i) as follows
P (i) =
NLoc(i)
NAll
(16)
where NAll is the total number of the 4 × 4 blocks and
the NLoc(i) denotes the number of the FMAX occured in
Loc(i). Figure 1 shows the occurrence probability of Loc(i)
with various quantization parameters QPs. It shows that the
distribution of Loc(0) has larger variation with various QPs,
while Loc(1) is the dominant location with the largest DCT
coefficients, over 50%, especially at lower QPs (higher bit-
rates). On average, over 70% and 80% of the largest DCT
coefficients fall within top-left 2×2 and 3×3, respectively.
In addition, the total energy of DCT satisfies the following
equality based on the energy conservation property,∑
m
∑
n
|f(m,n)|2 =
∑
u
∑
v
|F (u, v)|2 (17)
where f(m,n) and F (u, v) are the residual pixel values
and the DCT coefficients, respectively. The energy of AC
coefficients of a 4× 4 DCT block, EACs, can be derived as
the variance of the residual data,
EACs =
∑
u
∑
v
|F (u, v)|2 − |F (0, 0)|2

m=0

f(m,n)

= N2σ2f (18)
In (18), it shows that N2 times of the variance of
the input residual data σf is approximately the energy of
AC coefficients EACs. From (15) and (18), we have the
threshold for judging the ACs’ energy EACs as follows,
EACs < THACs(u, v) (19)
where
THACs(u, v) =
N2( 56Qstep)
2
32 [ARAT ]u,u [ARA
T ]v,v
Therefore, we first use the (13) to check the DC coefficient
F (0, 0) and then employ (19) to judge the ACs’ energy. An
improved method is derived from [8] and [9] for detecting
ZQBs as follows.{
|F (0, 0)| < 56Qstep
EACs < THACs(0, 2)
(20)
where the threshold THACs(u, v) is a symmetrical matrix,
i.e., THACs(u, v) = THACs(v, u). Based on an above
statical analysis, it has shown that the occurrence probability
that the largest DCT coefficients fall within top-left 3× 3 is
over 80%. Therefore, only use THACs(0, 2) as the threshold
for judging the ACs’ energy and further reduce the number
of comparisons compared with [8]. Moreover, by comparing
the second threshold of judeging ACs’ energy, a higher
threshold of proposed method than that of [9]. Hence,
proposed method have more capability to early detecting
more ZQBs.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We use the reference software JM11.0 [12] to implement
the proposed method. Six video sequences (’Akiyo’, ’Coast-
guard’, ’Foreman’, ’News’, ’Silent’, and ’Table Tennis’) with
different motion activities are used. They are in CIF format
(352 × 288) and have 150 frames to be encoded by IPPP
coding structure. The fast motion estimation with search
range 32 is enable and the number of reference frame is
set to 1. Rate distortion optimization is enabled for mode
selection and use six QP values in our experiments to
examine the performance at different bit rates. Note that if
the residual block is determined as ZQB, DCT/Q/DQ/IDCT
are skipped and residual block is assigned to zeros.
The objective performance in terms of the video quality
degradation (∆P ) is given as
∆P = POrg. − P (21)
where POrg. and P are the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR,
dB) obtained from the original encoder and the encoder
with each method, respectively. In addition, the detection
rate (DR, %) is defined as
DR(%) =
N
Nz
× 100% (22)
where N is the number of ZQBs being determined by early
detection algorithms prior to DCT/Q and Nz is the total
number of actual ZQBs. Table II-VII shows the results of
the PSNR degradation and detection rate by comparing to
the original encoder. Note that a negative ∆P means the
PSNR gain. On average, the better performance in terms
of detection rate is obtained by using our method with
insignificant PSNR degradation.

where OPOrg. is the total number of computation required

ure IV shows that the average CSR of each approaches at
different QPs. As we can see, our method can save up to 49
% of computation in DCT/Q/DQ/IDCT.
V. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes an improved detection method to
predict ZQBs by accounting for the experimental distribution
of largest DCT coefficients. The results exhibit insignificant
PSNR degradation with 0.08dB and a better detection qual-
ity of 90%. The computational results also show that the
computation of DCT/Q/DQ/IDCT are saved up to 54.6% .
