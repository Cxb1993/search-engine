Abstract 
This research is to explore the potential of DNA biomaterials for various optoelectronic 
devices. DNA forms complexes with various surfactants, including cetyltrimethylammonium 
chloride (CTMA), vinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride (VBTMA) and 
benzyltrimethylammonium chloride (BTMA). These DNA-surfactant complexes can be 
processed as conventional polymers for forming optical thin films. The electrical and optical 
properties of the newly-developed DNA-surfactant complexes were investigated. It is shown that 
the DNA-surfactant materials possess several advantageous features, such as a high 
decomposition temperature and high optical transmission. Furthermore, high quality optical thin 
film with a thickness of hundreds of nanometers can be formed by spin-coating process on 
various substrates. It is suggested that the newly-developed DNA-surfactant materials are 
promising to be utilized in numerous photonic applications.

A series of characterizations were performed to investigate the thermal, optical, and 
electrical properties of the synthesized DNA-based materials and thin films. IR spectra were 
recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was performed 
on a TA Instruments SDT Q600.  Optical transmission /absorption properties were obtained by 
means of a PerkinElmer UV-VIS Lamda 35. The energy levels were measured with a low-energy 
photoelectron spectrometer (AC-2). Morphology of thin films was characterized by SEM (JEOL 
JSM-5600) and AFM (Veeco/DI Nanoscope 3A). Refractive indices and extinction coefficients 
with respect to wavelength in the visible range were obtained by an ellipsometer (Mikropack 
Specel-2000-vis).  
 
四、結果及討論 
Formation of DNA-surfactant complexes 
Three DNA-surfactant complexes, DNA-CTMA, DNA-VBTMA, and DNA-BTMA, were 
synthesized by the procedures discussed in the previous section. The indication of successful 
formation of DNA-surfactant complexes can be supported by IR spectroscopic analysis. Fig. 1(a) 
is the IR spectra for DNA, CTMA and DNA-CTMA. Absorption peaks from both DNA and 
CTMA are observed in DNA-CTMA complex, where the characteristic C-H stretching absorption 
at 3000 - 2750 cm-1 is from CTMA and the absorption at 1700 -1600 cm-1 is from DNA. In Fig. 
1(b), absorption peaks at 3000 cm-1, 1500 cm-1 and 800-1000 cm-1 are indications for C-H 
stretching, CH2 bending, and the existence of aromatic ring in VBTMA, respectively. These 
peaks are shown together with DNA absorption peak at 1700-1600 cm-1 in DNA-VBTMA, which 
as well indicates the successful synthesis of the complex. Similar analysis can be applied in Fig. 
1(c) to show the successful formation of DNA-BTMA complex.

Optical properties of DNA-surfactant complex thin films 
Several measurements were carried out to examine the optical properties of DNA-surfactant thin 
films. High quality thin films were fabricated by spin-coating on quartz substrates. The 
transmission and absorption spectra of DNA-CTMA, DNA-VBTMA, and DNA-BTMA are 
shown in Fig 5. From the spectroscopic analysis, all three DNA-surfactant thin films have high 
transmission (>96%) from the visible to NIR (400nm-1100nm). This is a critical characteristic for 
applying DNA-surfactant as a host material for luminescent applications. This property is also 
supported from the extinction coefficient obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry as shown in Fig. 
6(b). The refractive index was evaluated to be ~1.5 in the visible regime.

price and fabrication easiness. Y. Yang from Kyushu University in Japan presented a 
wavelength-sensitive organic photodiode patterned by ink-jet method. They doped 
three kinds of dyes in conductive polymers, and the mixed materials are utilized to 
form films on ITO substrates by ink-jet method with a thin layer of Al deposited as 
cathode afterwards. Such technique is a promising method to make disposable and 
cost-effective organic photodiodes. Such fabrication scheme is also investigated in 
other organic devices. J.Viheriälä from Tampere University of Technology in Finland 
presented a highly productive soft UV-nanoimprint(NIL) method. The distinguished 
feature of this technique is to use an UV-transparent, soft, and flexible stamp, that 
enables imprinting of large areas without strict requirements for the flatness of the 
substrate. Using this method, they demonstrated a nanoimprinted DFB laser with a 
side-mode-suppression-ratio as high as 50dB. They claim this technique can be 
implemented to various material compositions. K. Yamashita from Kyoto University 
in Japan also presented a DFB laser fabricated by photo-NIL technology. They 
stacked three organic DFB lasers, where the emissive layers in each stack are doped 
with red, blue, and green dyes, respectively. Simultaneous three-color operations were 
presented, which demonstrates the feasibility of fabricating compact and 
multi-layered organic devices by NIL technology. 
Attention was paid in the recent development of novel materials as well, since 
one of the research interests in our NSC proposal is to explore the potential of 
utilizing novel biomaterials in photonic applications. There is a session devoted to 
“Discovered materials and random lasers”, where interesting research efforts on novel 
materials were presented. The presented works are relevant to our research topics and 
are very inspiring as well. Disordered materials are among one of the focuses in the 
category of “discovered material”, partly due to the emerging interest in random lasers. 
R. Sapienza from Spain presented a random laser with controlled emission by varying 
the diameters of the embedded monodisperse spheres. M. Birowosuto from University 
of Twente in the Netherlands reported the observation of a phenomenon regarding the 
local density states fluctuation in disordered photonic media. The material consists of 
single polystyrene spheres incorporated with dye molecules that are embedded inside 
a disordered layer of ZnO nanoparticles. From their reports, it is considered that 
biomaterial is also a potential candidate for investigation in random laser. 
Biomaterials possess special features in molecular configurations that are capable to 
be a supportive backbone of disordered materials. Moreover, the interactions of 
bio-molecules with metallic ions, atoms and molecules can be manipulated for 
exploring possible applications in sensors and relevant photonic devices. This 
property can couple with plasmonic effects in nanoparticles or nanostructures for 
enhanced performance and efficiency. Several research groups have reported their
