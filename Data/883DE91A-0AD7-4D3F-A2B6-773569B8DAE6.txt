二、英文摘要 
 
Abstract—In this project, we consider the prob-
lem of neural network adaptive control design for 
nonlinear singularly perturbed (NSP) systems with 
guaranteed ∞H  control performance. Based on the 
Lyapunov stability theorem and the tool of linear 
matrix inequality (LMI), we solve the controller 
gain matrix and a common positive-definite matrix 
and then a sufficient condition is derived to stabilize 
the NSP systems. The allowable perturbation bound 
*ε  can be determined via some algebra inequalities, 
such that the proposed neural network adaptive 
control will stabilize the NSP systems for all 
),0( *εε ∈ . A practical nonlinear circuit system is 
adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and effec-
tiveness of the proposed control scheme. 
 
Keywords — ∞H  control performance, linear 
matrix inequality (LMI), neural network adaptive 
control, nonlinear singularly perturbed systems. 
三、緣由與目的 
    Singularly perturbed (SP) theory has been 
intensively studies for about four decades; see 
literature [1-2] and the references therein. SP 
systems often occurred at the physical systems in 
engineering field, such as motor control system, 
electronic circuits, magnetic-ball suspension system, 
and so on such that the methodology of singular 
perturbation has been a popular tool for system 
analysis and controller synthesis. Recently, there 
have appeared a number of stability analysis and 
stabilization of singular perturbation systems and 
consider the stability bound *ε , see [3-4]. In [3], 
two new approaches including time and frequency 
domain were employed to solve the maximal 
stability bound *ε . In [4], based on the frequency 
domain representation, a set of new stability bound 
was derived for the stability of SP systems. These 
stability criteria can be easily verified by computing 
certain singular values within finite frequency 
intervals. However, all these stabilization bound 
problems are dealing with the linear singular 
perturbation systems. 
    During the past two decades, a number of papers 
have been presented to deal with fuzzy logic and its 
applications [5-13]. There have been rapidly 
growing interest in T-S type fuzzy models; see 
[5-13]. The theory of LMIs [14] has been 
widespread used as a tool in order to solve the 
stability of T-S fuzzy model. In this type of fuzzy 
model, linear models represent local dynamics in 
different state space regions. The overall model of 
the system is achieved by fuzzy blending of these 
linear models. Nonlinear control approaches based 
on the T-S fuzzy model have been also successfully 
developed in the framework of LMI designs [5-13]. 
Recently, many researchers focus on the ∞H  
control design for SP systems, NSP systems and 
nonlinear systems [7, 9, 10-11, 15]. The objective of 
∞H  attenuation control design is to restrain the 
influence of external disturbances. For SP fuzzy 
systems, [9] considered the problem of designing a 
∞H  fuzzy controller with pole placement 
constraints for a class of NSP systems. where, a ∞H  
fuzzy controller is provided to guarantee the
