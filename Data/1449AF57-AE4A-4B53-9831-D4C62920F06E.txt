Abstract 
 A probability-based method for 
selecting an optimal NDI 
(non-destructive inspection) technique 
and its associate inspection schedule for 
steel bridge superstructure system 
subjected to corrosion fatigue problems 
is presented. The probability of detection 
(POD) function for crack size of an NDI 
technique is utilized as the measure of 
inspection quality.  Through Monte 
Carlo simulations for crack growth and 
repair actions after inspections, n times 
of inspections could generate 2n kinds of 
repair scenarios and the corresponding 
crack growth patterns (curves).  
Considering all crack growth curves and 
repair scenarios from Monte Carlo 
simulations, selecting a suitable NDI 
technique and its associate inspection 
schedule for a steel bridge 
fracture-critical member with the 
acceptable structural safety requirements 
becomes a mathematical optimization 
problem.  The solution of the problem 
can provide an economic and safe 
inspection strategy for steel bridges 
against “fatigue” or “corrosion-fatigue” 
problems.

FILLET WELDED CRUCIFORM JOINTS USING A DIGITAL CAMERA

Abstract 
An experimental method using a commercial digital camera to evaluate the stress intensity factors (SIFs) of 
load-carrying fillet welded cruciform joints was demonstrated in this paper. The crack opening 
displacements (CODs) in un-penetrated region of the cruciform joint detail were successfully measured by 
a commercial digital camera and employed in a suggested least-squares procedure for SIF evaluation. In 
this study, five cruciform joint specimens with different fillet weld sizes were tested and analyzed. The test 
results agree well with the SIF formula of cruciform joints in British Standard PD-6493, and show that the 
presented experimental method is able to give satisfactory SIF evaluation for load-carrying fillet welded 
cruciform joints. This method can be applied to any detail with a crack where the Irwin’s series solution for 
crack-tip displacement fields is valid. Furthermore, the simplicity and portability of this experimental 
method make it possible for field measurement of SIFs directly from the detail of interest at the site, which 
is very helpful for fatigue evaluation of details in structures like steel bridges or offshore structures. 
Introduction 
Fractures or crack initiations usually occur at the high stress concentration regions of 
fillet welded cruciform joints, like weld roots and weld toes, when tensile loadings or 
cyclic loadings are applied.  Determining the stress intensity factors (SIFs) at weld roots 
or toes was of great interests in the past and extensive works had been done to evaluate 
SIFs accurately.  Previous studies on numerical evaluation of SIF at weld toes were 
performed by Maddox (1975), Hobbacher (1993), Bowness and Lee (1996) and Lie and 
Bian (1997)…etc.  For load-carrying cruciform joints, the fillet weld root in the un-
penetrated region of the joint may act as a crack tip to yield high stresses or to initiate 
fatigue crack under cyclic loadings.  The polynomial expression of SIF for the weld root 
in a fillet welded cruciform joint was first proposed by Frank (1971) and modified by 
British Standard PD-6493 (BS PD-6493, 1991) as follows:

r and θ are located on the non-negative-y-coordinate region. u and v are the 
displacements in x and y direction respectively and expressed by r and θ   in the polar 
coordinates; µ =shear modulus; κ =3−4ν for plane stress and κ =(3−ν)/(1+ν) for plane 
strain; ν = poisson’s ratio. Inc  and IInc  are parameters to be determined.  Specifically, the 
first terms of Inc  and 
II

respectively as follows:

Kc =  (7) 
Once the parameters, Inc  and 
II
nc , are determined, the stress intensity factors of the 
cracked detail can be derived.  In this study, crack opening displacements (CODs) rather 
than point displacements near the crack tip are measured by the digital camera in the 
experiment.  Two rows of evenly spaced square symbols printed on the paper are glued 
on the specimen with the crack in the middle as shown in Figure 2.  Each row of the 
square symbols locates ∆y away from the crack surface in the y-direction.  The CODs of 
the crack are measured by the relative displacements between the top and bottom rows of 
square symbols.  Suppose the CODs of m pairs of top and bottom square symbols near 
the crack tip are considered.  The sum of error squares of these CODs resulted from 
experimental measurement or numerical simulation can be expressed as follows:

where Π is the sum of error squares; ∆ui and ∆vi are the COD components in x and y 
directions resulted from experimental measurement or numerical simulation for the ith 
pair of square symbols; [U]i and [V]i are [U] and [V] matrixes in Equations (4) and (5) 
for the ith pair of square symbols.  To perform least squares method, the sum of error 
squares Π can be minimized by letting { } 0c/ II =∂Π∂  and { } 0c/ I =∂Π∂ .  Therefore, the 
linear system equations can be rearranged as:

Experimental Results 
The five load-carrying fillet welded cruciform joint specimens (A3, A7.5, A9, A12 and 
A15) were tested and analyzed in this study.  Except for the A3 specimen which was 
tested under 5kN and 10kN tensile loads only, all the other specimens were tested under 
the four specified tensile loads (5kN, 10kN, 15kN and 20kN) to measure the CODs at 
different load levels.  After following the procedures of the digital camera experiment 
described in the previous section, each specimen can yield a series of COD data near the 
crack tip under the specified tensile load.  With the measured COD data, the stress 
intensity factor of the specimen corresponding to the specified load can be computed by 
the least squares method.  The normalized KI values of all five specimens under different 
tensile load levels from the digital camera experiment and the corresponding absolute 
errors relative to the results from Equation (1) are listed in Tables 1.

Table 1.  Comparison of Magnification Factor for the Five Specimens 
Equation (1) shows that crack size (2a) in the un-penetrated region and fillet weld size (h) 
affect stress intensity factor in a direct manner for load-carrying fillet welded cruciform 
joints.  The influences of fillet weld size (h) can be observed and verified in the five 
specimens tested in this digital camera experiment.  For comparison, crack size ratio and 
fillet weld size ratio are defined as 2a/w and h/B respectively, where w is the sum of 
crack size (2a) and two times of fillet weld size (2h) of a cruciform joint and B is the 
attachment plate thickness.  It can be seen that the normalized SIFs obtained from the 
suggested digital camera experiment agree well with the magnification parameter (Mk) 
computed from Equation (1) provided by British Standard PD-6493 (1991).  In addition, 
the greater the fillet weld size ratio, the lower the magnification parameter.  The 
increment of fillet weld size can essentially reduce the stress intensity factor of the weld 
root detail in a fillet welded cruciform joint.
