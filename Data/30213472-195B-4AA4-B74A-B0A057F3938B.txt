英文摘要: 
  Each vehicle moves in different directions with high speed on VANET. Under such circumstances, 
reliable data transmission is hard to work since the transmission delay is not predictable and packet loss 
occurs frequently. Moreover, the network topology changes all the time. Therefore, in the first year, we had 
constructed a VANET implementation environment and proposed reliable bundle layer transmission. Thus, we 
implement bundle layer transmission scheme on VANET environment. We perform it under V2I, V2V and 
mix mode (i.e., combination of V2I and V2V). Furthermore, to raise the transmission efficiency of bundle 
layer transmission, we proposed a cross layer design mechanism. It is a segment-to-segment forwarding 
algorithm in application layer. Accordingly, data transmission becomes more efficient and reliable. Finally, the 
hop-by-hop bundle layer transmission scheme is integrated with other subprojects and main project to build a 
complete Telematics service system.

V2V routing has attracted significant attention in recent years. Broadly speaking, existing VANET 
routing protocols [1-2] can be classified as follows:  
1) Mobile ad hoc network (MANET)-based routing: such VANET protocols are based on 
principles and techniques originally designed to facilitate MANETs (mobile ad hoc networks), e.g., 
dynamic source routing (DSR) [3] and ad-hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) [4]. 
2) Position-based routing: such protocols [5-12] utilize vehicle and geography information to 
construct a mobility model to support the routing decision. In traditional position-based routing [5], 
the end-to-end path is constructed using vehicle location and speed information provided by GPS 
transmitters. However, simple position-based routing schemes are inefficient in urban scenarios 
since the radio transmissions are frequently blocked by obstacles such as tall buildings, underpasses, 
and so on. In practice, the movements of the nodes within a VANET (i.e., the vehicles) are 
constrained by the physical layout of the road system. Thus, various sophisticated position-based 
VANET routing schemes have been proposed in which the vehicle information is supplemented by 
a street map in order to construct a more realistic mobility model [6-11]. In the Geocast routing 
scheme [12], the network is partitioned into discrete regions in accordance with geographical 
information, and the data transmissions within each region are handled separately using a 
multicasting approach. However, due to its use of a flooding policy, Geocast incurs a significant 
message overhead and network congestion is almost unavoidable. In addition, some of methods 
predict the change of network topology by collection of geographic information. The authors [13-14] 
use dynamic evaluation of the conditions (distance from the sender, geographical position, area, etc.) 
for resending or receiving messages to raise the performance.  
3) Cluster-based routing: such protocols are designed for vehicles traveling together in a group, 
or VANETs in a rural environment with sparse nodes. In such scenarios, highly stable 
communications are achieved by confining the route selection decision to a small group of vehicles. 
In other words, the network topology is effectively static. Therefore, some researchers have relied 
on wireless cluster network environment for constructing reliable connections. Because VANET is 
an unstable network, cooperative transmission is developed by constructing wireless cluster 
networks. The authors [15-16] establish highly stable communication by setting up routes within the 
same vehicle group. They believe that relying on mobile information to establish a reliable path is 
impossible. Therefore, they constructed partially connected VANETs. Message ferry routing 
algorithm is also a particular application under integration of DTN and VANET. In the routing 
protocols proposed in [17-18], the problem of implementing VANET applications in 
sparsely-populated networks is resolved by using a message ferry (MF) to collect and relay data 
between disconnected VANETs. Typically, the MF is mounted on a vehicle with a regular and 
predicable trajectory, e.g., public transport vehicles such as buses.    
4) DTN routing: such protocols utilize conventional DTN approaches such as the BP protocol or 
epidemic routing [19-20] to accomplish routing in vehicular DTNs. In [21], a proactive data 
bundling system based on the DTN BP protocol was proposed for establishing reliable 
communications in mobile environments characterized by intermittent connectivity. However, the 
BP protocol has a number of inherent disadvantages, including a large memory requirement at each

(2) Intelligent adjustment forwarding： 
 
A. System Model 
This study considers the urban VANET environment that is a two-dimensional Manhattan grid 
model shown in Fig. 4. As shown, the streets are lined with buildings, which cause the 
communications to fail when they fall between two vehicles. It is assumed that the non-line-of-sight 
(NLOS) communication range of 5.9 GHz DSRC is approximately 7.5 m and the movement of the 
vehicles is governed by the Manhattan mobility model. Furthermore, an assumption is made that 
RSUs are located at every intersection and are inter-connected via the Internet. Every vehicle or 
RSU in the network is regarded as a potential traffic source or destination. However, while all of the 
vehicle nodes relay data whenever required, the RSUs do not (in order to avoid the hotspot effect). 
Each vehicle is embedded with a GPS device and can therefore obtain its own position and velocity. 
Furthermore, the position of the destination is obtained using a location service implemented at both 
the vehicles themselves and the RSUs. The V2V and V2R communications within the network are 
handled in accordance with the IEEE 802.11p standard. The V2V traffic comprises short video clips, 
audio streams, traffic or news information, and so forth. When inter-vehicle communication is not 
possible due to the distance between the vehicles or the presence of obstacles, communications are 
accomplished using the V2I mode rather than the V2V mode.

discovery process, the source obtains the position information of all the nodes along the 
transmission path and then determines which of these nodes should be nominated as ICPs 
(intermittently connected point) by examining the quality of their downstream links. The data is 
then transmitted toward the destination by the ICPs using a store-and-forward paradigm. In the 
event that the source node is unable to locate the destination (i.e., because the destination lies at a 
greater number of hops from the source than the value assigned to the TTL parameter), the data is 
transmitted to the segment endpoint, which assumes full control of the data and performs a 
store-carry-and forward function in order to deliver the data to the destination. Thus, in the ad hoc 
mode, IAF provides an efficient and reliable transmission performance even in network 
environments with disabled end-to-end paths. The workflow of IAF algorithm is shown in Fig. 3. 
 TCP is an end-to-end transfer protocol and is therefore incompatible with IAF, which provides a 
segment-to-segment communication service. Thus, as described in the following, TCP must be 
modified to enable its integration with IAF. The data packet header in IAF has three fields 
containing the sender IP address, the target ICP IP address, and the destination IP address, 
respectively. Initially, IAF adds the IAF header to the data and sends it to the transport layer. When 
the transport layer receives the data and accesses the IAF header, it specifies the target ICP IP as the 
destination IP for the transport protocol (TCP). TCP adds its packet header to the data and sends it 
to the ICP. When the transport layer of the ICP receives the data, it strips the packet header and 
forwards the IAF header and data to the application layer. If the destination IP address matches that 
of the receiving node, IAF strips the IAF header and retrieves the data; else, the node simply 
propagates the data. 
Theoretically speaking, delay and reliability are closely related in VANET environments. In other 
words, to improve the transmission reliability, the data should be stored at a relay node. However, 
this results in an increase in the delivery delay. Thus, the objective of the IAF algorithm proposed in 
this study is to improve the transmission reliability without increasing the network delay. That is, 
IAF attempts to provide both an efficient routing service and a reliable data transmission 
performance. Furthermore, regardless of the lower layer protocol used at the transport or network 
layers, the protocol can be compatible with IAF.   
 
(3) Integration：  
Figure 5 shows Telematics integration system framework. The subproject1 programs the 
application function for providing Telematics service and then call function of bundle layer 
transmission. Therefore, the Telematics services provided by subproject1 are also reliable.

  In first part, we guarantee the availability of BP-transfer in VANET through the implementation.

Scenario 2 – intermittent connectivity (1)

In scenario 2, both schemes are retransmitted from source if the transmission failure is 
happened in first connection.

Scenario 4 – intermittent connectivity (3)

However, the delivery time is too long to data is delivered to destination, such as scenario 4. If 
end-to-end connection is existed before data delivery, original version which has short delivery 
time would have higher success rate of data delivery than BP transfer version. 
 
 16 
In scenario 6, NB-1 move away the transmission range of RSU-1 after it completely receives data 
from server. Because NB-1 has the custodian of data, it can continuously deliver data to NB-2. 
However, original version will be failed in this situation. 
Finally, The results of performance measurement are shown in the following tables. It is seen that 
the delivery ratio of BP-transfer is higher than original version in VANET although the delivery 
time is longer.

practical in VANET.  
Although the delivery ratio of existing VANET approach is not the best, overall performance is 
still has its value. Existing VANET approach has a terrible phenomenon that the delivery ratio is 
going down soon with large data transmission because end-to-end path cannot be maintained for a 
long time in VANET. The retransmission will not finish either once transmission cannot finish in 
limited time. In other word, the performance of existing VANET approach would be good as if the 
retransmission is not happen. In figures 14 and 16, the performance is better when network density 
is higher because the stable link is more and transmission path is many. Comparing the figures 13 
and 15, the delivery ratio of existing VANET approach under sparse network in average vehicle 
speed 40 km/h is less than 60 km/h because mobility can increase capacity in this situation. In 
summary, the recession of delivery ratio with increase data size in existing VANET approaches 
because it does not only consider to find the end-to-end path but also make the strategy of 
transmission failure.  
In figures 13 and 14 shows the proposed algorithm has high delivery ratio in highly dynamic 
topology and figures 15 and 16 shows that it also has high delivery ratio and stable in low dynamic. 
Especially, it is much better than others in highly dynamic networks and large data transmission 
especially the bundle size is 15 Mbytes and mare because the situation of transmission is in 
end-to-end transmission is unreliable but segment-to-segment transmission is still reliable. The 
proposed algorithm delivers data from this segment to the other one until reaching destination 
because end-to-end transmission path cannot be maintained. Furthermore, the delivery ratio of 
proposed algorithm is also worse as soon as segment-to-segment connection cannot be maintained 
(in figure 13, 50 nodes with 60 km/h and data size is 50 Mbytes). In figure 15 (50 nodes with 40 
km/h), delivery ratio of IAF is worse than others because the link state prediction is not suitable in 
less change of network topology. In less dynamic environment, the prediction is unnecessary 
because the most of links are stable. Therefore, IAF may miss to predict the link state, it cause 
larger transmission time and then data delivery will be failed. In summary, the simulation result 
shows that VANET data gets successful delivery can be through segment-to-segment transmission.  
Comparing the three schemes, BP has a high delivery ratio in small data size transmission but the 
delivery ratio of existing VANET approach is less. Because transmission time of BP is small when 
transfer data size is small and has a guarantee of data delivery, it has higher delivery ratio. The 
existing VANET approach mainly focus on how to find the best route to prevent link break but the 
available end-to-end path is almost none in VANET environment. The proposed algorithm has high 
performance no matter what size of data transmission because it based on segment-to-segment 
transmission and the size of segment can be adapted according to link state. The size of segment 
path may be short (e.g. two or three hops) if the most of link state are terrible or it may be long (e.g. 
end-to-end path) if the most of link state are excellent. To get the successful delivery, the proposed 
algorithm ensure reliable of each segment transmission path. In addition, it will hand over the data 
to segment endpoint even although the transmission path is not found. Therefore, whether the 
probability of destination discovery or data delivery, it will be better than source. In other words, 
the performance of retransmission is better than other two schemes. 
 24 
VANET approach just want to find an available path but it does not consider after link had been 
broken. 5) The segment-to-segment transmission has better performance than end-to-end 
transmission in VANET environment. 
 
6. Suggestion and future work: 
The implement results show that the BP is available in VANET and more adaptive than original 
version. However, BP-transfer scheme is still need for improvement. Therefore, we proposed IAF 
algorithm to raise the performance. In the future, the VANET communication will be reliable as 
soon as IAF is implemented in VANET.
