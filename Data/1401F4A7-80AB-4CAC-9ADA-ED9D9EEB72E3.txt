 Lattice Coding for the MIMO Fading Dirty-Paper Channels 
 
 
英文摘要 
Dirty paper coding (DPC) deals with the interference channels where the interference is assumed 
perfectly know at the transmitter. It has been shown that DPC can achieve the interference-free capacity 
for such interference channels as if the interference is not present. As an application, recently it has also 
been shown that DPC can achieve the capacity of the Gaussian broadcast channels (GBC) in both the 
single antenna case where both the base station and the user terminals have one antenna, and the multiple-
input multiple-output (MIMO) case where the base station and the user terminals could be equipped with 
more than one antennas. However, these results were all based on the assumption that the perfect channel 
state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter. When this assumption no longer holds, it is yet an 
open problem what the broadcast channel capacity is and what coding techniques can achieve the capacity. 
One special case where only the statistics of the CSI are available at the transmitter has been extensively 
studied recently. It was shown that a more general class of coding techniques called the linear-assignment 
Gel'fand-Pinsker coding (LA-GPC) could have good (sometimes near interference-free) performance in a 
variety of such channels with fast and slow fadings. However, only the information-theoretic achievable 
rate computation has been provided so far, and there have been no practical design and implementation of 
the LA-GPC. In this project, we considered the design of nested-lattice based LA-GPC for the 
interference channel where only the statistics of the CSI are available at the transmitter. Both fast and 
slow fading channels were considered. The resultant LA-GPC encoders and decoders are practical, and 
can serve as the fundamental building blocks to achieve the promised rate performance of MIMO GBC 
with only the statistics of the CSI known at the base station.

2I. INTRODUCTION
Gel’fand and Pinsker [1] first considered the issue of communication with interference noncausally
available at the transmitter but not available at the receiver. Recently, many renewed interests arose in the
applications of a subclass of this problem called the linear-assignment Gel’fand-Pinsker coding (LA-GPC),
where a linear strategy is used [2]. Costa [2] first applied the LA-GPC in additive Gaussian noise channels,
and revealed a surprising result that by treating the Gaussian interference as the side information (SI), the
interference-free rate is achievable even when the SI is known only at the transmitter. Costa named this
special case of the LA-GPC as dirty paper coding (DPC). The DPC result is based on the assumption that
perfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is available. That is, the fading coefficients of
the wireless channel are perfectly known not only to the receiver but also to the transmitter. However,
it is hard to have perfect CSIT in the wireless setting. Typically, the channel coefficients are estimated
at the receiver and fed back with limited feedback channel bandwidth to the transmitter. In practice, we
can assume that only the channel distribution information at transmitter (CDIT) is known and adopt the
general LA-GPC. For single-input multiple-output (SIMO) slow fading SI channels, the LA-GPC has
optimal interference-free outage performance [3]. For fast fading channels, the LA-GPC also has good
(sometimes near optimal) rate performance in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) settings [4].
Perhaps one of the most important applications of the LA-GPC is the MIMO Gaussian broadcast
channel (GBC). A MIMO GBC system consists of one transmitter sending information to many receivers,
all equipped with multiple antennas. With perfect CSIT, the capacity region of MIMO GBC was shown
to coincide with the achievable rate region when the MIMO DPC is utilized [5]–[7]. The key to this
capacity-achieving performance is that the MIMO DPC can efficiently use the information of the multi-
user interference, known at the transmitter, to make the receiver decode messages with a rate as if the
undesirable interference does not exist. With only CDIT, the MIMO DPC does not perform well [8]. Using
the general MIMO LA-GPC has been shown to have significant rate gains over applying the MIMO DPC
naively or other beamforming-based strategies in the ergodic fast fading MIMO GBC [8] [4]. In the slow
fading single-input GBC, using LA-GPC also provides a significant gain over the time-division scheme
[3]. In contrast to the DPC for which structured codebook designs are well known [6] [7] [9], all current
promising results of the LA-GPC [3] [4] [8] are based on unstructured random Gaussian codebooks. Lack
of structured codebooks so far hinders practical applications of the LA-GPC.
In this report, we show that with judiciously designed spatial filters, good nested lattice coding can
achieve all achievable rates of the MIMO LA-GPC. Unlike codebooks used in the previous works [1]–[4],
[8], lattice codebook has an algebraic structure and is possible to be implemented in practice. We rewrite
the LA-GPC rate function in a non-trivial equivalent form. This new form motivates the subtle selections
of the transmitter SI filter and the receiver filter to achieve the LA-GPC rate with lattice codes. We also
provide a simulation for slow-fading channels, and near optimal interference-free error performance is
obtained. Our coding can be directly applied to fading MIMO GBC with CDIT to obtain the rate gains
derived in [3] [4] [8]. In summary, the main contributions of this work are
1) We proposed new designs of the SI and receiver filters in the nested lattice coding to make the LA-
GPC rate achievable. This rate was achievable previously only with unstructured random Gaussian
codebooks [1]–[4], [8]. In Lemma 3, we show that for lattice coding with only CDIT, the receiver
filter must be different from the transmitter SI filter. Such a result contrasts with the common
practice in the structured DPC design [6] [7] [9]. Note that although the LA-GPC and DPC seem
only different in the selections of the “linear-assignment matrix” in [1]–[4], [8], this difference
will in fact change the entire encoder/decoder design [8]. Naively applying the DPC in [6] [7] [9]
(designed with perfect CSIT) for the fading SI channels with CDIT will suffer a significant rate loss
compared with applying the LA-GPC. Examples were shown in [8, Sec. IV.B] and our simulation
in Sec. VI.
2) Our transmitter can accommodate a new covariance matrix constraint suggested by [5], in addition
to the conventional average power constraint in [6] [10]. An additional transmitter filter as in Lemma
4The modulo-Λ operation associated with V is then
g mod Λ = g−Q(g).
Let u be a dither uniformly distributed in V and independent of g. The dithered quantization error
(g+u) mod Λ
is also uniformly distributed in V as u, and independent of g. The autocorrelation matrix of this error is
ΣV = E{u(u)T}.
Since the lattice is nondegenerate, ΣV is positive-definite and nonsingular.
III. MIMO LINEAR-ASSIGNMENT GEL’FAND-PINSKER CODING AND ITS ACHIEVABLE RATE
In this section, we will introduce the MIMO LA-GPC and its achievable rate RLA, using random
Gaussian codebooks. Note that directly calculating RLA by its definition as in [4] results in a complicated
formula. It is then hard to prove that RLA equals to the maximum achievable lattice code rate in Sec. IV.
The new form of RLA in Lemma 1 will help to solve this problem elegantly. We consider the following
channel, which represents (1) in the Shannon random-coding setting as †
Y N = H(XM +SM)+ZN. (4)
For simplicity, we first consider the full CSIT case by replacing H with its realization H. By using the
“linear-assignment” strategy in the random binning technique [1], the following rate is achievable
I(UM;Y N)− I(UM;SM),
with
UM = WSM +XM, (5)
where XM ∼ NR(0, 12ΣI) is independent of SM, and W is an M×M matrix. Costa showed that if W can
be selected according to the full CSIT H, then the optimal interference-free rate is achievable [2]. He
named this special LA-GPC as DPC. For the quasi-static slow fading channel (4) with only CDIT, we
consider the outage probability [3] as the performance metric. Defining
RLA(H) = I(UM;Y N|H = H)− I(UM;SM),
the outage probability associated with rate R is
P{H : RLA(H)< R}.
In [3], it is shown that LA-GPC achieves the interference-free outage performance for SIMO channels
with properly selected W according to the CDIT. Although only the selection of matrix W is different
compared with the DPC, the random binning codebook will be changed accordingly [8] and the coding
proposed in [6] cannot be applied.
We now explicitly compute RLA(H). For simplicity, we use notation RLA to replace RLA(H) in the
following. The linear assignment matrix W is assumed to be determined in advance according to the
CDIT as in [3]. By concatenating T random vector Y N in (4) as in Sec. II, we can focus on the following
equivalent channel
Y NT = ˜H ˜XmT +HSMT +ZNT , (6)
where
H = IT ⊗H, ˜H = H(
√
2Σ∗G)
†To emphasize the differences between the lattice codebook setting and the unstructured Shannon random codebook setting, signal vectors
in the former are denoted in bold-face lower-case while those in the latter are denoted in italic capital with dimensions given in the superscripts.
6IV. NESTED LATTICE CODING WITH SPATIAL FILTERING
In this section, we will show that combining the proposed spatial filters and “good” nested lattice
coding, RLA in Lemma 1 is still achievable under the transmission input constraint (3) without using
random Gaussian codebooks. The nested lattice codes is defined as follows. Let lattices Λc and Λq meet
Λq ⊆ Λc. The codeword set of the nested lattice code is
Cc = {Λc mod Λq}.
We choose the dimensions of lattices as mT , where mT is defined right after (7). The code rate is then
R =
1
T
log
||Vq||
||Vc|| ,
where Vc and Vq are the Voronoi regions of Λc and Λq, respectively.
The proposed encoder will select a codeword cc ∈ Cc from the message index and send
x = Ft((cc−Fss−u) mod Λq), (13)
where the dither u is uniformly distributed in Vq and independent of the channel. As in Sec. III, we can
focus on the fixed channel corresponding to (2) as
y = H(x+ s)+ z.
The decoder will first produce
yˆ = L(Fry+u) = L(c∗c + e), (14)
where the second equality of (14) comes from [17], with c∗c ∈ Λq + cc ∈ Λc,
e = (Fr ˜HF− ImT )u+(FrH−Fs)s+Frz, (15)
and
˜HF = HFt.
The generalized minimum Euclidean distance lattice decoder in [10] is used to obtain
cˆc = [Gc ˆb] mod Λq, (16)
where
ˆb = arg min
b∈ZmT
|yˆ−LGcb|2,
cˆc is the decoded codeword and Gc is the generator matrix of Λc.
We will show the selection of the proposed filters Ft, Fs, Fr, and L in the following lemmas. First,
let the autocorrelation matrix of the dithered quantization error of Λq be ΣV . Since the lattice Λq is
nondegenerate, ΣV  0. We can apply the Choletsky factorization [20] to obtain the matrix Σ∗V satisfying
Σ∗V (Σ
∗
V )
T = ΣV . (17)
The matrix Σ∗
V
is lower triangular and nonsingular. And we select the transmitter filter Ft as
Lemma 2: Let
Ft = Σ∗G(Σ∗V )
−1,
where Σ∗G and Σ∗V are defined in (7) and (17), then the transmitter covariance matrix Σx equals to ΣG,
which satisfies the covariance constraint Σx  ΣG.
8Finally, combining the previously specified filters with a “good” nested lattice defined in [10] [6], the
optimality of the proposed encoding/decoding scheme is given by Theorem 1.
Theorem 1: Let filters Ft, Fs and Fr be selected as in Lemma 2 and 3, respectively, and the second
moment P(Vq) of Λq be 12 . If L in (14) is chosen as
L = Σ∗V (Σ
∗
E)
−1,
in which Σ∗E(Σ∗E)T = ΣE and Σ∗V is defined in (17), based on sequences of “good” nested lattices, the
coding scheme specified in (13)-(16) is able to achieve the LA-GPC rate RLA when T → ∞.
Proof: First note that ΣEM
˜U
is the covariance matrix of the LMMSE error EmT
˜U ,MMSE as in Lemma 1,
thus it is always invertible [19]. From the proof of Lemma 3,
ΣE = 2ΣV ΣEM
˜U
,
then L always exists since ΣV is also invertible. Basically, the lattice decoding error with rate R will
approach zero as T → ∞ if
R
(a)
<
1
2T
log |LTL|= 1
2T
log |ΣV ||ΣE |
(b)
= RLA. (22)
The equality (b) was shown in Lemma 3. Note that the proof of equality (b) is completely new and has
not appeared in the literature before. As for the proof of the inequality (a), the main difference compared
with the proof in [10, Thereom 5] comes as follows. In [10], the transmitter has no CSIT and is subject
to a conventional average power constraint. Therefore the filter Ft is not required. However, to meet (3),
the filter Ft is needed in our case. This fact makes the filters in e (see (15)) related to the covariance
matrix ΣV of u, while those in [10] are irrelevant to ΣV . In our case, directly applying the methods in
[10], where the non-white u in e is replaced by a white Gaussian noise, will not produce a “noisier” noise
than Le in (14). One can not upper-bound the decoding error probability based on systems with such a
noise. The shaped lattice quantizor and its related properties [18] will play an important role in solving
this problem. The technical details can be found in [17].
V. DISCUSSIONS
As a special case of Theorem 1, we also propose a MIMO DPC for SI channels with perfect CSIT.
The optimal linear-assignment matrix is
Ws = W ˜X ,MMSEH,
where W
˜X ,MMSE is the LMMSE filter used to estimate ˜XmT in (6) without interference SMT . When T →∞,
it can easily be checked that with the selected Ws, Fr = W ˜X ,MMSE and RLA becomes the interference-free
rate. If we treat Hs as SI, then
Fs = Fr = W ˜X ,MMSE.
We summarize the features which make the proposed coding a non-trivial extension of [6] [10].
1) In [6] [10], Fr = WX ,MMSE , which is the MMSE filter to estimate XMT from
HXMT +ZNT
where XMT ∼ N(0, 12IMT ). Also Fs = Fr in [6], and Fs is absent in [10]. Our selections of Fs and
Fr in Lemma 3 are clearly non-trivial extensions of those in [6] [10], since the proof of (19) is
completely new. Note that our Fs will equal to Fr as in [6] only in the full CSIT case. Even in that
case, we select the W
˜X ,MMSE according to the equivalent channel ˜H defined right after (6) which
takes the covariance matrix constraint ΣG into consideration. However, the Fr = WX ,MMSE in [6]
[10] is selected directly according to the original channel H.
10
correspond to the cases simulated with unstructured Gaussian codebooks. The other curves were simulated
with nested lattice coodbooks. We used the pair of self-similar randomly generated nested lattices drawn
from the ensemble of Construction-A lattices defined in [23]. The parameters of the linear code [23] in
this lattice are n = MT,(p,k) = (47,6). The lattice decoder in [24] is used to solve (16). Note that the
proposed filters are all block diagonal, thus the decoding complexity is the same as that in [10]. The
block error rates are obtained by averaging over at least 10000 channel realizations at high SNR. For
comparison, we also present the “interference as noise” cases. In these cases, the nested lattice encoder
completely ignores the Gaussian SI s, and the decoder treats the interference plus noise s+n as an
equivalent Gaussian noise to decode the lattice codewords. In [8], applying LA-GPC has been shown to
significantly outperform applying DPC naively, where the latter means that the transmitter assumes the
channel is fixed at its expected value E[H]. Since our channels are zero mean, the “naive DPC” curves
in [8] equal to the “interference as noise” curves in our simulations, which also suffer a lot due to lack
of full CSIT.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this report, we focused on structured codebook designs for MIMO fading side-information channels
where interference is known at the transmitter. We showed that the rate performance of the MIMO LA-
GPC using random Gaussian codebooks can be achieved by carefully designed spatial filters combined
with nested lattice coding. With only CDIT, the proposed coding scheme has good, sometimes optimal,
rate performance. When full CSIT is available, the proposed coding scheme can achieve the optimal
interference-free rate. Our coding can be applied to MIMO GBC with CDIT or perfect CSIT to obtain
the promised rate performances.
