Abstract 
Owing to the spherical pressure hull are 
good for space planning and volume 
efficiency in compartment layout, they are 
largely applied for marine structure in order to 
bear static, periodic and random load. The 
circular cross section of spherical pressure 
hull is the best way to resist the external 
pressure load. When the spherical pressure 
hulls were made by bending and welding 
metal plates, such working methods will lead 
to deformations which make them unable to 
achieve ideal circular cross section 
configuration. It is necessary to ensure 
working quality control by means of 
specification. The out-of-round ratio is used to 
evaluate the circularity effect of pressure hull. 
The ABAQUS is used to study the response of 
imperfect spherical pressure hull with external 
stiffeners subjected to the underwater shock as 
well as fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is 
considered. The imperfect spherical pressure 
hull is established that refer to the 
out-of-round ratio. The results studies 
presented in this paper can provide structure 
designer with an effective tool at design stage  
and attempt to supply a reasonable 
comprehensive account, which will be used in 
designing structure so as to enhance resistance 
to underwater shock damage. 
Keywords: out-of-round ratio, imperfect 
spherical pressure hull

ABSTRACT 
A Stiffened cylindrical pressure hull is usually applied in a boiler, pressure vessel or 
pipeline system which takes the internal pressure load, or in a submarine which takes the 
external pressure load. This study is investigating a stiffened cylindrical pressure hull at a 
depth of 10m and 50m below the water level to see how it takes sideward TNT 782 kg 
underwater explosion loading so as to understand its structural transient response. ABAQUS 
finite element software is used as an analysis tool in the current study, meanwhile, during the 
analysis process, the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) condition is added. The structural 
transient response results of stress and displacement time history of stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull at different underwater depths can be used as reference for anti-underwater 
explosion analysis and design of future submersible vehicle, pressure hull or related structural 
designer. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Commercial and military vehicles usually adopt stiffened cylindrical pressure hulls as the 
form of a pressure-resistant structure. For military submersible vehicle, in addition to 
considering water pressure loading, the underwater explosion loading generated during the 
operation environment should also be considered too. When commercial submersible vehicle 
is located in unknown underwater environment, it will unavoidably encounter the impact 
loading generated during the collision behaviour. Therefore, the nonlinear response generated 
by the submersible vehicle pressure hull due to such dynamic transient is very important 
factor to be considered when performing pressure hull structural design and analysis. Military 
submarine pressure hull mainly comprises of three traditional pressure hull structures such as: 
cylinder, dome end and conical pressure hull (as shown in Figure 1). Since stiffened 
cylindrical pressure hull possesses good space planning and volume efficiency in the internal 
cabinet allocation, it thus occupies most of the space of the pressure hull.

2.2 The pressure history function P(t) of main shock wave of underwater explosion 
When explosion starts under the water, the water pressure caused by shock wave will 
decay in exponential form with time. At any observation point under the water, the 
relationship of shock wave pressure versus time is as shown in the following [5].

mP : The wave front pressure for shock wave to propagate to the observation point, 
which is also called peak pressure; t: the time past for shock wave front to reach the 
observation point, q: decay time constant. For TNT explosive at different explosive weights 
W and shock source distance R, the explosive experience constants A1=1.144, A2=-0.247, 
K1=52.12 and K2=0.0895[5]. 
2.3 Fluid and structure  coupling behaviour 
When stiffened cylindrical pressure hull takes shock wave under the water, its structural 
response, during the analysis, should consider at the same time the flow field behaviour 
surrounding it. This fluid and structure mutually interactive action will continue until the 
vibration of the structural body decays to steady state. ABAQUS used Surface-based 
Interaction Procedure to perform coupling analysis on the nodes of the intimate contact 
surface between the structure and the fluid, and the detailed analysis process of Surface-based 
Interaction Procedure is listed in the literature [6]. After incident shock wave contacts the 
structure, the reflected pressure wave is called scattered pressure wave, which should be taken 
into account in the analysis. The major solving equations are as in the followings [7]:

Here Ms is the structural mass matrix, Cs is the structural damping matrix, Ks is the 
structural stiffness matrix, PI is the incident shock wave, PS is the scattered pressure wave 
and u is the structural displacements. Mf is fluid mass matrix, Cf is fluid damping matrix, Kf 
is fluid stiffness matrix and Sfs is fluid solid coupling transform matrix. The fluid traction T 
in Eq.(5) is the quantity that describes the mechanism by which the fluid drives the solid. 
3. THE TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF STIFFENED CYLINDRICAL PRESSURE 
HULL SUBJECTED TO SIDE-ON UNDERWATER EXPLOSION LOADING 
In this work, stiffened cylindrical pressure hull is used as the target and ABAQUS[6] is 
used as the tool to investigate the structural response of the case when cylindrical pressure 
hull subjected to side-on underwater explosion loading with the consideration of 
structure-fluid coupling effect. The capability verification of ABAQUS in analyzing such 
problems has listed in detail in the literature [8-9]. The analysis parameters such as stiffened 
cylindrical pressure hull, flow field, material mechanical properties and loading conditions are 
described as in the followings. 
 60 
The stiffened cylindrical pressure hull full model is adopted for the analysis. Therefore, 
at the geometrical centre of the finite element model, the Inertia Relief command of 
ABAQUS is used at three shift components zyx uuu  ,  , and three rotational components 
zyx ,fff  ,  to perform inertial release of pressure loading. The boundary at the peripheral of 
the fluid will make the shock impact wave generate refraction or reflection, which will in 
turn lead to the overlapping or cancelling effect of it with the incident wave in the analysis 
field. To avoid such phenomenon, during the analysis, the fluid element boundary at the 
peripheral of the flow field will be set up to be Non-reflection Boundary, that is, when 
pressure reaches this boundary, it will all flow out and there will be no reflection. For the 
intimate contact surface between stiffened cylindrical pressure hull and the fluid, 
Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) condition and ABAQUS Tie command are used to set the 
fluid surface and structural surface of this intimate contact surface to be free of rotational 
degree of freedom. 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this paper, von-Mises stress is used as the pressure hull strength failure judgment 
reference when pressure hull takes static water pressure and explosion loading. In the 
followings, the analysis results will be described at water depths of 10m and 50m for stiffened 
cylindrical pressure hull in terms of standoff point acceleration time history, displacement 
time history, von Mises stress time history, pressure hull displacement time history and von 
Mises stress distribution history. 
4.1 Standoff point acceleration time history 
Figure 8 is the time history of acceleration change of standoff point under the effect of 
shock wave at water depth of 10m and 50 m for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull. It can be 
seen from Figure 8 the maximum acceleration for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull at water 
depths of 10m and 50m all occur at 1.0002s after the start of the explosion. At water depth of 
10m, the maximum acceleration is 45,774.8 m/sec2, at water depth of 50m, the maximum 
acceleration is 46,004.2 m/sec2. It can be seen that the water depth is increased 5 times, but 
the maximum acceleration of standoff point of the stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increases 
by about 0.501%. 
4.2 Displacement time history of the standoff point 
Figure 9 is the time history diagram of displacement change at the standoff point  under 
the effect of shock wave for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull at depths of 10m and 50m. It 
can be seen from Figure 9 the displacement of the standoff point forms a peak shape and the 
maximum value of the displacement occurs at 1.0032s after the start of the explosion. At 
water depth of 10m, the maximum displacement is 10.1673 mm. At water depth of 50m, the 
maximum displacement is 10.4075 mm. It can be seen that when the water depth is increased 
by five times, the maximum displacement of the standoff point of stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull increases by about 2.31%. 
4.3 The von Mises stress time history at the standoff point 
The von Mises stress of the standoff point can be divided into two parts such as upper 
surface stress and inner surface stress. The upper surface is the intimate contact surface 
between the structure and the fluid and the results are described respectively as in the 
followings: 
 62 
stress. 
4.5 The displacement history of pressure hull 
Figure 14 is the time history diagram of displacement for stiffened cylindrical pressure 
hull under the action of shock wave at water depths of 10m and 50m respectively. It can be 
seen from Figure 14 that: In the entire explosion reaction history, stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull with water depth of 10m and 50m, the maximum displacement in the shock 
wave moving direction (x direction) all occur at 1.006s, wherein the maximum displacement 
at water depth of 10m is 11.15mm and the maximum displacement at water depth of 50m is 
19.49mm. It can be seen that the water depth is increased by 5 times and the maximum 
displacement for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increases by about 74.80%. Therefore, we 
can understand that the maximum displacement is highly affected by water depth. 
5. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, stiffened cylindrical pressure hull containing external ribs is used as the 
target and ABAQUS is used as tool to study the response of the cylindrical pressure hull at 
different water depths by taking underwater explosion loading with the structure-fluid 
coupling effect taken into account. The results are summarized as in the followings: 
(1) During the action period of the explosion wave, the acceleration of the standoff point 
changes in vibration way, wherein the maximum acceleration of stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull at water depths of 10m and 50m all occur at 1.0002s after the start of the 
explosion. At water depth of 10m and 50m, the maximum acceleration is 45,774.8 
m/sec2and 46,004.2 m/sec2. It can be seen that the water depth is increased by 5 times, the 
maximum acceleration of the standoff point of stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increase 
by only about 0.501%. 
(2) During the action period of the explosion wave, the displacement at the standoff point 
forms a peak shape, and the maximum of the displacement occurs 1.0032s after the start 
of the explosion. At water depth of 10m and 50m the maximum strain is 10.1673 mm and 
10.4075 mm. The water depth increase by 5 times, the maximum strain of the standoff 
point of stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increases by about 2.31%. 
(3) No matter it is upper surface or inner surface, the peak zones of von Mises stress are 
located at time history of 1.0007-10013s, 1.003-1.0035s and 1.004-1.006s of the 
explosion respectively. The peak value stress is roughly in the same stress range, but the 
stress peak value of the inner surface shows a gradual increase way. In the mean time, in 
the range of 1.0007-1.006s, it can be clearly seen that due to different water depths, the 
von Mises stresses as reflected by pressure hull are obviously different, the higher the 
water depth is, the higher the reflected von Mises stress is. 
(4) During the shock wave action period and at water depth of 10m, from the von Mises stress 
of the standoff point change history on the upper surface (fluid intimate contact surface), it 
can be seen that the maximum von Mises stress occurs at 1.0032s and the value is 
288.886Mpa. At water depth of 50m, the maximum von Mises stress occurs at 1.0032s too 
with a value of about 317.716 Mpa. The water depth increases by five times, the upper 
surface von Mises stress at the standoff point of stiffened cylindrical pressure hull 
increases by about 9.98%. 
(5) At water depth of 10m, the von Mises stress maximum value of the inner surface of the 
standoff point occurs at 1.005s and the value is 327.817Mpa. At water depth of 50m, the 
maximum von Mises stress occurs at 1.0054s with a value of 335.514Mpa. Water depth

ABSTRACT 
A Stiffened cylindrical pressure hull is usually applied in a boiler, pressure vessel or 
pipeline system which takes the internal pressure load, or in a submarine which takes the 
external pressure load. This study is investigating a stiffened cylindrical pressure hull at a 
depth of 10m and 50m below the water level to see how it takes sideward TNT 782 kg 
underwater explosion loading so as to understand its structural transient response. ABAQUS 
finite element software is used as an analysis tool in the current study, meanwhile, during the 
analysis process, the Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) condition is added. The structural 
transient response results of stress and displacement time history of stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull at different underwater depths can be used as reference for anti-underwater 
explosion analysis and design of future submersible vehicle, pressure hull or related structural 
designer. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Commercial and military vehicles usually adopt stiffened cylindrical pressure hulls as the 
form of a pressure-resistant structure. For military submersible vehicle, in addition to 
considering water pressure loading, the underwater explosion loading generated during the 
operation environment should also be considered too. When commercial submersible vehicle 
is located in unknown underwater environment, it will unavoidably encounter the impact 
loading generated during the collision behaviour. Therefore, the nonlinear response generated 
by the submersible vehicle pressure hull due to such dynamic transient is very important 
factor to be considered when performing pressure hull structural design and analysis. Military 
submarine pressure hull mainly comprises of three traditional pressure hull structures such as: 
cylinder, dome end and conical pressure hull (as shown in Figure 1). Since stiffened 
cylindrical pressure hull possesses good space planning and volume efficiency in the internal 
cabinet allocation, it thus occupies most of the space of the pressure hull.

2.2 The pressure history function P(t) of main shock wave of underwater explosion 
When explosion starts under the water, the water pressure caused by shock wave will 
decay in exponential form with time. At any observation point under the water, the 
relationship of shock wave pressure versus time is as shown in the following [5].

W and shock source distance R, the explosive experience constants A1=1.144, A2=-0.247, 
K1=52.12 and K2=0.0895[5]. 
2.3 Fluid and structure  coupling behaviour 
When stiffened cylindrical pressure hull takes shock wave under the water, its structural 
response, during the analysis, should consider at the same time the flow field behaviour 
surrounding it. This fluid and structure mutually interactive action will continue until the 
vibration of the structural body decays to steady state. ABAQUS used Surface-based 
Interaction Procedure to perform coupling analysis on the nodes of the intimate contact 
surface between the structure and the fluid, and the detailed analysis process of Surface-based 
Interaction Procedure is listed in the literature [6]. After incident shock wave contacts the 
structure, the reflected pressure wave is called scattered pressure wave, which should be taken 
into account in the analysis. The major solving equations are as in the followings [7]:

in Eq.(5) is the quantity that describes the mechanism by which the fluid drives the solid. 
3. THE TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF STIFFENED CYLINDRICAL PRESSURE 
HULL SUBJECTED TO SIDE-ON UNDERWATER EXPLOSION LOADING 
In this work, stiffened cylindrical pressure hull is used as the target and ABAQUS[6] is 
used as the tool to investigate the structural response of the case when cylindrical pressure 
hull subjected to side-on underwater explosion loading with the consideration of 
structure-fluid coupling effect. The capability verification of ABAQUS in analyzing such 
problems has listed in detail in the literature [8-9]. The analysis parameters such as stiffened 
cylindrical pressure hull, flow field, material mechanical properties and loading conditions are 
described as in the followings. 
 8 
The stiffened cylindrical pressure hull full model is adopted for the analysis. Therefore, 
at the geometrical centre of the finite element model, the Inertia Relief command of 
ABAQUS is used at three shift components zyx uuu  ,  , and three rotational components 
zyx ,fff  ,  to perform inertial release of pressure loading. The boundary at the peripheral of 
the fluid will make the shock impact wave generate refraction or reflection, which will in 
turn lead to the overlapping or cancelling effect of it with the incident wave in the analysis 
field. To avoid such phenomenon, during the analysis, the fluid element boundary at the 
peripheral of the flow field will be set up to be Non-reflection Boundary, that is, when 
pressure reaches this boundary, it will all flow out and there will be no reflection. For the 
intimate contact surface between stiffened cylindrical pressure hull and the fluid, 
Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) condition and ABAQUS Tie command are used to set the 
fluid surface and structural surface of this intimate contact surface to be free of rotational 
degree of freedom. 
4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this paper, von-Mises stress is used as the pressure hull strength failure judgment 
reference when pressure hull takes static water pressure and explosion loading. In the 
followings, the analysis results will be described at water depths of 10m and 50m for stiffened 
cylindrical pressure hull in terms of standoff point acceleration time history, displacement 
time history, von Mises stress time history, pressure hull displacement time history and von 
Mises stress distribution history. 
4.1 Standoff point acceleration time history 
Figure 8 is the time history of acceleration change of standoff point under the effect of 
shock wave at water depth of 10m and 50 m for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull. It can be 
seen from Figure 8 the maximum acceleration for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull at water 
depths of 10m and 50m all occur at 1.0002s after the start of the explosion. At water depth of 
10m, the maximum acceleration is 45,774.8 m/sec2, at water depth of 50m, the maximum 
acceleration is 46,004.2 m/sec2. It can be seen that the water depth is increased 5 times, but 
the maximum acceleration of standoff point of the stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increases 
by about 0.501%. 
4.2 Displacement time history of the standoff point 
Figure 9 is the time history diagram of displacement change at the standoff point  under 
the effect of shock wave for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull at depths of 10m and 50m. It 
can be seen from Figure 9 the displacement of the standoff point forms a peak shape and the 
maximum value of the displacement occurs at 1.0032s after the start of the explosion. At 
water depth of 10m, the maximum displacement is 10.1673 mm. At water depth of 50m, the 
maximum displacement is 10.4075 mm. It can be seen that when the water depth is increased 
by five times, the maximum displacement of the standoff point of stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull increases by about 2.31%. 
4.3 The von Mises stress time history at the standoff point 
The von Mises stress of the standoff point can be divided into two parts such as upper 
surface stress and inner surface stress. The upper surface is the intimate contact surface 
between the structure and the fluid and the results are described respectively as in the 
followings:

4.5 The displacement history of pressure hull 
Figure 14 is the time history diagram of displacement for stiffened cylindrical pressure 
hull under the action of shock wave at water depths of 10m and 50m respectively. It can be 
seen from Figure 14 that: In the entire explosion reaction history, stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull with water depth of 10m and 50m, the maximum displacement in the shock 
wave moving direction (x direction) all occur at 1.006s, wherein the maximum displacement 
at water depth of 10m is 11.15mm and the maximum displacement at water depth of 50m is 
19.49mm. It can be seen that the water depth is increased by 5 times and the maximum 
displacement for stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increases by about 74.80%. Therefore, we 
can understand that the maximum displacement is highly affected by water depth. 
5. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, stiffened cylindrical pressure hull containing external ribs is used as the 
target and ABAQUS is used as tool to study the response of the cylindrical pressure hull at 
different water depths by taking underwater explosion loading with the structure-fluid 
coupling effect taken into account. The results are summarized as in the followings: 
(1) During the action period of the explosion wave, the acceleration of the standoff point 
changes in vibration way, wherein the maximum acceleration of stiffened cylindrical 
pressure hull at water depths of 10m and 50m all occur at 1.0002s after the start of the 
explosion. At water depth of 10m and 50m, the maximum acceleration is 45,774.8 
m/sec2and 46,004.2 m/sec2. It can be seen that the water depth is increased by 5 times, the 
maximum acceleration of the standoff point of stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increase 
by only about 0.501%. 
(2) During the action period of the explosion wave, the displacement at the standoff point 
forms a peak shape, and the maximum of the displacement occurs 1.0032s after the start 
of the explosion. At water depth of 10m and 50m the maximum strain is 10.1673 mm and 
10.4075 mm. The water depth increase by 5 times, the maximum strain of the standoff 
point of stiffened cylindrical pressure hull increases by about 2.31%. 
(3) No matter it is upper surface or inner surface, the peak zones of von Mises stress are 
located at time history of 1.0007-10013s, 1.003-1.0035s and 1.004-1.006s of the 
explosion respectively. The peak value stress is roughly in the same stress range, but the 
stress peak value of the inner surface shows a gradual increase way. In the mean time, in 
the range of 1.0007-1.006s, it can be clearly seen that due to different water depths, the 
von Mises stresses as reflected by pressure hull are obviously different, the higher the 
water depth is, the higher the reflected von Mises stress is. 
(4) During the shock wave action period and at water depth of 10m, from the von Mises stress 
of the standoff point change history on the upper surface (fluid intimate contact surface), it 
can be seen that the maximum von Mises stress occurs at 1.0032s and the value is 
288.886Mpa. At water depth of 50m, the maximum von Mises stress occurs at 1.0032s too 
with a value of about 317.716 Mpa. The water depth increases by five times, the upper 
surface von Mises stress at the standoff point of stiffened cylindrical pressure hull 
increases by about 9.98%. 
(5) At water depth of 10m, the von Mises stress maximum value of the inner surface of the 
standoff point occurs at 1.005s and the value is 327.817Mpa. At water depth of 50m, the 
maximum von Mises stress occurs at 1.0054s with a value of 335.514Mpa. Water depth
