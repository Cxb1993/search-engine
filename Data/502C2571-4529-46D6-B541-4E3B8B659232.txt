1. Abstract 
  A 6DOF Stewart-type platform driven by 
piezoelectric actuator is designed for numerous 
applications in need of nanoscale positioning 
purpose. The design and manufacture of 
precision mechanisms includes the flexure joints, 
the piezoelectric actuators, and the lower 
fixed-base platform and the upper movable 
platform. By means of ANSYS simulation, the 
stiffness of the joint, and the workspace as well 
as the maximum stress of the platform are 
studied in order to attain better design purpose. 
The nonlinear hysteresis effect of the 
piezoelectric actuator is analyzed using a 
dynamic Preisach model along with the 
wipe-out property to improve its accuracy. A 
feed-forward controller is designed based on the 
proposed dynamic Preisach model to deal with 
the nonlinear effect. Variation of the 
end-effector is measured by the developed 
3-points-3-axes method. As a matter of fact, the 
desired variation of the end-effector is different 
from the actual variation due to manufacture 
error and assembly error. Therefore, error 
compensation model is established for 
calibration. The tracking performance of the 
platform is experimented following a spiral 
trajectory. From experimental data, it indicates 
that the developed platform system is able to 
achieve the target of nanoscale positioning for 
numerous ranges of manipulating stroke. 
Therefore, it verifies a cost-effective design 
with no need of sensor for feedback control for 
a complex 6DOF platform is practicable.

2. Introduction 
  The micro-positioning technique has become 
very important for precision engineering in 
various application areas such as 
semiconductors, biomedical science, optics, and 
microscopy, to name a few. Several popular 
micro-positioning platforms, for example, the 
scanners of STM, AFM, and 6DOF hexagonal 
structures are widely used. These devices 
demand high precision. However, unavoidable 
errors creep in during mechanism manufacture 
and from assembly. These critical errors along 
with the nonlinearity of the actuator increase the 
difficulty of precision control, and may 
deteriorate the device’s performance. Recently, 
many researchers have studied the platform 
 4
respectively. The origin of each frame is located 
at the centroid {BC,PC} of the platforms. Each 
joint locates at the apex of the regular hexagon. 
The radii of circumscribed upper and lower 
circles are denoted by rB and rP, respectively. 
The angle λi between BCBi and xB , and the angle 
Λi between PCPi and xP are given in [14], and 
expressed by

4. Mechanism Design 
The design and manufacture of precision 
mechanisms includes the flexure joints, the 
piezoelectric actuators, and the lower fixed-base 
platform and the upper movable platform. By 
means of ANSYS simulations, parameters such 
as the stiffness of the joint, the workspace, the 
maximum stress of the platform, and the 
capability of cutting are studied and the design 
is optimized. 
When connecting legs to the payload 
platform, flexure joints are used to minimize 
backlash and friction, both of which are 
undesirable in precision engineering 
applications. The design of the flexure joint and 
the casing made of Aluminum 6061-T6 are 
shown in Figure 3. The notch of the joint is 
made for every quarter circle (90o) which has 
isotropic performance so that the positioning 
accuracy is preserved without the influence of 
unequal deformation. Incorporation of 
piezoceramic stacks into a casing generally 
improves the stability against mechanical 
impact and environmental influences, and a 
lateral slot is prepared for the wire. In Figure 3, 
the extension of the leg with respective to 
applied voltage and the stiffness along each 
moving direction with respect to external load 
can be analyzed by ANSYS [16]. 
  The workspace of the platform for equal 
extension of the legs is investigated as shown in 
Figure 4. It shows the workspace looks like a 
spindle, and the maximum stress generated 
relative to each pose is about 110MPa (when 
using Aluminum 6061-T6 which has a yield 
stress of 255MPa). Figure 5 shows that the force 
generated by the platform is estimated about 
16N, which is an index of the platform’s 
capability of coping with an external load. 
 
5. Hysteresis Controller 
5.1. Preisach Model 
  Hysteresis exists in the piezoelectric ceramics 
and it increases the difficulty of using these 
actuators in high-precision control design. The 
classical Preisach model that ignores the effect 
of the variation of input voltage is suitable for 
static analysis. A new dynamic Preisach model 
is proposed here to deal with the rate-dependent 
 6
means the predicted value by the inverse 
Preisach model [16]. 
 
6. Measurement and error compensation 
6.1. Measurement and Error Compensation 
  The task-space output of the platform is 
measured by the developed 3-points-3-axes 
method [15], which has the advantage of 
needing fewer measurement devices. First of all, 
we define the Cartesian coordinate system with 
the origin at the center of the cube, with the x 
and y axes, parallel to the x and y axes of the 
upper platform, respectively, and z axis is in 
line with the z axis of the upper platform. Then, 
we set up the measurement devices to aim at the 
measurement directions X, Y and Z. For easy 
computation, the procedures are: 
[step1] Define the coordinate system (X, Y, Z) 
with the origin at the center of the upper 
movable platform. Set up the measurement 
devices to aim at the measurement directions X, 
Y and Z, respectively. For easy computation, 
select three points (S1, S2, S3) as shown in Figure 
7; S1 is the center of the coordinate system, and 
S2 and S3 will let the lines 21SS  and 31SS  
equal to D and parallel to the y and z axes 
respectively while the measurement direction is 
along the x axis; similarly, lines 21SS  and 31SS  
parallel to the x and z axes respectively while 
the measurement direction is along the y axis, 
and lines 21SS  and 31SS  parallel to the y and x 
axes respectively while the measurement 
direction is along the z axis. Note that, as shown 
in Figure 7, H is the distance between S1 and the 
intersection of the extended lines of the 
neighboring two legs. 
[step2] Assign desired variation of the 
workspace and compute the equivalent variation 
of the leg by inverse kinematics. Apply input 
voltage to each leg respectively and measure the 
variations of (S1, S2, S3) for each measurement 
direction. 
[step3] Compute the measured displacement and 
angle variations. For example, from the 
geometric relation shown in Figure 8, ΔXS1 
andΔXS2 are obtained via the measurement 
(S1,S2), and ΔXS1 andΔXS3 are obtained via the 
measurement (S1,S3). Thus, ΔX, ΔθY and ΔθZ for 
the measurement direction along the x axis can 
be computed by using ΔXS1,ΔXS2, ΔXS3, H and D. 
The computation equations are listed in Table I. 
[step4] Repeat step3 to compute (ΔY, ΔθX, ΔθZ) 
and (ΔZ, ΔθY, ΔθX) in the other two 
measurement directions. The computation 
equations are listed in Table I. 
[step5] Determine the variation of the 
workspace with the above computed (ΔX, ΔθY, 
ΔθZ), (ΔY, ΔθX, ΔθZ), and (ΔZ, ΔθY, ΔθX) by ( )

6.2. Construction of Error Compensation 
Model 
Output positioning errors of the platform 
may result from several factors including 
(a) inaccurate mechanism design and 
manufacturing, 
(b) inappropriate assembly, 
(c) incorrect kinematic model,  
(d) unexpected deformation of the mechanism 
under external force. 
It is attempted to build an error compensation 
model to deal with the above errors. The error 
compensation procedure is depicted in Figure 9. 
Before the compensation procedure, desired 
trajectory hd is planned in advance in the 
task-space, and the desired joint-space 
displacement qd is calculated by inverse 
kinematics. The equivalent input voltage signal 
u is then computed by the inverse Preisach 
model as described previously. Each joint 
actuator output is substituted into the platform 
system to obtain the variation of the 
end-effector h. In comparison with the desired 
hd, error is found. 
As legs with an extension, the actual 
task-space output h on the upper movable 
platform will be measured by use of the 
3-point-3-axes method. It is attempted to adjust 
the lengths of the legs in order to make h and hd 
equal. As long as the relationship between the h 
and hd is linear, the interpolation method is used 
to calculate the desired compensation variation 
hdc of the end-effector, by which the desired 
compensation variation qdc of the legs are then 
obtained by inverse kinematics. 
While the compensation procedure is carried 
out, the compensator is implemented between 
the desired trajectory and the inverse Preisach 
model as shown in Figure 9. Once the error 
compensation model is built in the workspace, 
the accuracy of the platform is improved.
