英文摘要 (Abstract)  
In this project we prepared ternary PtRuNi 
nanoelectrocatalysts on N-doped carbon 
nanotubes via thin film deposition methods. 
Electrochemical measurement results revealed 
the appropriate Ni content improved the 
methanol oxidation activities. Density 
functional theory calculation implied the N 
dopant sites on tubes provide different 
interaction with the metal atom resulting in 
excellent dispersion of nanoelectrocatalysts.  
 
Keywords: multicomponent, one-dimensional 
material, nanoelectrocatalyst, density

1. Introduction 
Studies of electrocatalysis for fuel-cell 
reactions are central to the development of 
fuel cells (FCs).1 More specifically, seeking 
the best electrode materials consisting of 
carbon-supported electrocatalysts plays a key 
role in the route towards enhanced and 
optimized FC performance. One-dimensional 
(1D) carbon nanomaterials such as carbon 
nanotubes (CNTs) and nanofibers have drawn 
substantial attention as the support materials 
for electrocatalytic nanoparticles.2 It is further 
reported that the direct growth of CNTs on the 
gas diffusion layer (GDL), usually carbon 
cloth or carbon paper inserted between bipolar 
plate and catalyst layer, can increase the 
output power under a low catalyst loading in 
FC tests.3, 4 Recently nitrogen-doped carbon 
nanotubes (NCNT) have been used in the 
electrode layers in FCs and supercapacitors. 
As the catalyst support for FC applications, 
Lin et al. reported that adding appropriate N 
doping in CNTs can prevent Pt agglomerates 
on pure, undoped CNTs and result in nearly 
monodisperse Pt nanoparticles.5 On the other 
hand, Fang demonstrated that NCNT can help 
RuO2 and V2O5 dispersion and thus get higher 
capacitance than using undoped CNTs in 
supercapacitor applications.6-8 Therefore, in 
this paper we continue to put our efforts in 
taking the advantage of NCNT/GDL as the 
support materials for catalyst in FCs.  
Pt- and PtRu-based nanoparticles with large 
surface-to-volume ratios are of major interests 
for FCs since the 1960s.9, 10 To date, the 
controlled synthesis of them has been widely 
studied with respect to composition, size, 
shape and facet control. However, to the best 
of our knowledge there is still limited research 
on the controllable synthesis of 
electrocatalysts on NCNT/GDL. Among the 
reported catalyst preparation methods, thin 
film deposition has been employed to make an 
nanostructured catalyst layer. Hence in this 
work a scalable vacuum sputtering process is 
investigated to form the nanometer-sized 
electrocatalysts on NCNT/GDL. Stamenkovic 
et al. reported that Ni can tailor the electronic 
structure of Pt in Pt3Ni(111) for improved 
oxygen reduction activity.11 The addition of Ni 
to the Pt and PtRu catalysts as a possible 
enhancing agent for the methanol 
 4
electrode was separated from the working and 
counter electrode compartment by a Luggin 
capillary, were employed for the 
electrochemical studies. A saturated calomel 
electrode (SCE) was used as reference 
electrode. However, all potentials reported in 
this work are reported vs. the reversible 
hydrogen electrode (RHE) using a potential 
difference for SCE vs. RHE. A large surface 
area Pt gauze served as counter electrode. 
ACS grade chemicals and high resistivity 18 
MΩ water were used. CO was adsorbed onto 
the electrodes at 0.15 V by bubbling CO gas 
through the 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for 20 min. 
Solution CO was subsequently removed by 
bubbling high purity argon gas for 40 min. 
maintaining the potential at 0.15 V. The 
potential was then cycled for 2 cycles at a rate 
of 10 mVs-1. The intersection between COads 
oxidation peak and its background in the first 
two cycles was picked up as onset potential 
(Eon).  
Instrumentations and Techniques: 
Electrochemical experiments were performed 
using Solartron SI 1287 
potentiostat/galvanostat (Solartron Group Ltd.) 
computer controlled by Corrware software 
(Scribner Assoc.). A Bruker D8 advance x-ray 
diffraction (XRD) system was employed to 
obtain XRD patterns. The scanning angle 2θ 
extended from 30 to 90o. X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained 
using a Kratos Axis Ultra spectrometer. A 
Hitachi S-4800 SEM and a transmission 
electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) 
were employed to obtain morphological 
information of the catalyst samples and 
substrates. The mass per unit area of the 
metals has been determined by inductively 
coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy 
(ICP-OES, PerkinElmer ICP-OES Optima 125 
3000). In this report, all samples were loaded 
with approximately 0.2 mg Pt per geometry 
area of each cm2. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Fig. 1(a) shows the atomistic models of N 
dopants in zigzag (10,0) nanotube clusters 
with and without metal attachment. It is 
reported that the extrinsic N dopants can help 
metal catalyst dispersion on NCNTs. 
Therefore, we propose that the metal atom 
stays around the N dopant sites in our models. 
Fig. 1(b)-(d) illustrates the morphology of 
NCNTs directly grown on the E-tek CC. In 
Fig. 1b, the E-tek CC with the NCNTs on top 
turns black compared with the as-received 
gray CC sample on the left-hand side. Fig. 1(c) 
shows that the porous CC is the ensemble of 
carbon fibers with the diameter of several tens 
of micrometers as a GDL. In Fig. 1(c), it is 
observed that a thin N-CNT layer can be 
directly grown on the surface of carbon fibers. 
Subsequently, the magnetron sputtering is 
performed to deposit Pt, Ru and Ni on 
NCNTs/CC. The process details are described 
in the supporting information. After sputtering, 
the high-magnification SEM image in Fig. 1(d) 
shows the high-surface-area, catalyst-coated 
NCNT. Fig. 1(e) is the TEM micrograph of a 
single catalyst-coated NCNT with darker 
contrast than the uncoated CNT. It is quite 
clear that physical vapor deposition can 
generate high-density nano-catalysts on the 
sidewall so as to form the shell of a nanocable. 
In Fig. 1(f), the clear lattice fringe of the 
nanocrystals, with the particle size as small as 
several nanometers, can be observed. Fig. 1(g) 
shows the XRD patterns of multicomponent 
catalysts deposited on N-CNT/CC. It is 
important to notice that the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of the Pt peak changes 
 6
Ru + H2O Æ Ru-OH + H+ + e-   (1) 
M-CO + Ru-OHÆM + Ru +CO2 + H+ + e- (2) 
In Eq. (2), M can be a single Pt, Ru or Ni 
monoatomic site on the catalyst surface onto 
which CO can absorb. As indicated in Fig. 
3(b), the lowest Eon and the narrowest full 
potential width at half maximum (EFWHM) are 
observed for PtRuNi(20 W) catalyst, 
suggesting better oxidation kinetics for the 
complete COads to CO2 oxidation than other 
catalysts. This advantage in COads oxidation 
kinetics is likely due to the modified atomistic 
distribution, electronic structure, and particle 
size of the catalyst particles and their 
individual component. In Fig. 3(c), the 
chronoamperometric measurements showed 
that the PtRuNi(10 W) catalyst has the highest 
performance for methanol oxidation.  
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the preparation and 
performance of NCNT-supported PtRuNi 
electrocatalysts have been reported. Compared 
to PtRu catalyst, the PtRuNi catalyst exhibits 
higher methanol oxidation current and lower 
COads stripping potential. Our studies shed 
light on advanced control of nanometer-sized 
catalysts on 1D NCNTs for FC technologies.
