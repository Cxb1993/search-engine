中文摘要
隨著市場競爭愈來愈激烈，產品保固逐漸扮演著重要的角色，其作用不僅在於保障
消費者的權益，對廠商而言，也是一個不可忽視的行銷手段，因為附有較佳保固契約的
產品對需求有刺激的作用。然而保固同時也會使廠商必須負擔額外的保固成本，所以廠
商在產品上市與促銷時必須將其納入整合策略的考量，其中包含產品訂價、生產和產品
保固策略等，彼此息息相關。因此，廠商若想提升利潤就不能以單一策略作考量而需做
整合的思考。過去，很少有學者根據這些情況去研究廠商應如何制定最佳的決策。再者，
新產品可靠度退化的歷史資料可能非常稀少或難以取得，因而無法以傳統的統計方法加
以估計其參數並且去進行相關的決策分析。而貝氏決策程序(Bayesian decision)則是提供
這種情境下的解決方法，使得相關的決策分析在缺法歷史資料情況下依然能夠進行。因
此，本研究提出以貝式決策程序為基礎的數學分析模式，幫助廠商在缺乏產品歷史資料
的情況下，有系統地決定產品訂價，生產和保固策略。此外，本研究亦提出電腦化之架
構設計幫助相關決策者實現決策過程之資訊化。關於產品特性方面，本研究主要設定在
產品為可維修且其回廠檢修頻率服從非齊次蒲瓦松過程(Non-homogeneous Poisson
process)之假設。

31. Introduction
In general, to maximize the profits of a new developed product, a manufacturer must
consider several different aspects, such as customer demand, production process, and product
deterioration… etc., and yet enumerate some possible warranty policies which can be adopted
and therefore take the corresponding costs into account. These factors should be managed to
comprehensively determine the optimal overall strategy for both production and marketing.
For examples, while the total sales and revenues might optimistically uplift as the price is
reduced and/or the term of the warranty is extended, it would unavoidably increase the
warranty cost. Besides, it would also be necessary to magnify the production scale to cope
with the uplifting sales, and such a considerable production scale in a short term would lead to
the increases of manufacturing costs and business risks. Figure 1.1 shows the influence
diagram that illustrates the interactions among pricing, production, and warranty.

5In dealing with the aforementioned complex decision problem, traditional algebra and
calculus method are difficult to solve. Therefore, we can utilize numeric methods and a
mathematical programming approach to develop the decision model that technically avoided
some complicated mathematical difficulties and practically released some unnecessary
constraints. However, such a decision model is dependable if the sufficient historical data are
available. In some cases that the historical data are insufficient to confidently estimate the
deterioration of a new developed product, the results obtained from this model may not be
assertively reliable. Under such a situation of scarce data, the Bayesian analysis could be an
applicable and reasonable approach to additionally take the experts’opinions into account for
better decision making. Kwon (1996) proposed a Bayesian life test sampling plan for products
with Weibull distributions. Percy et al. (1997) solved the problem of preventive maintenance
schedules by a Bayesian approach when data were sparse. The approach included prior
knowledge about manufacturing processes of similar systems. Papazoglou (1999) utilized a
Bayesian decision analysis to solve a problem of reliability certification. Papazoglou’s
approach was on the basis of the existing prior assessment of uncertainties and the obtained
further information through testing of the components. Perlstein et al. (2001) developed a
Bayesian method in determining the optimal burn-in duration for a batch of products whose
life distributions were modeled as a mixture of two exponential populations. Percy (2002)
discussed several suitable forms of prior distribution for common models and developed the
concept of predictive elicitation to specify hyper-parameters of subjective prior distributions.
Huang (2001) utilized a Bayesian decision approach for deteriorating repairable systems in
dealing with situations in which historical data is insufficient. Huang and Chang (2003)
developed a fuzzy Bayesian decision process in modeling human perception without precise
mathematical predictions. Juang and Anderson (2004) considered a Bayesian approach to
determine an optimal adaptive preventive maintenance policy with minimal repairs.
Soundappan et al. (2004) compared evidence theory and Bayesian theory for both uncertainty
7maintenance visits.
Owing to the fact that the failure times of the product would influence the estimation
of repair costs, it is important to realize the characteristic of the failure times of the product.
Here, we assume that the breakdown process of the product behaves as a time-dependent
NHPP(non homogeneous Poisson process), and the two commonly intensity functions: power
law and exponential, which are given by
1( )t t    (2.2)
and
( ) tt e   , (2.3)
respectively would be used in this study. However, it may be difficult to specify the
deterministic values for both  and  for the decision maker under the situation of
insufficient historical failure data. Thus, the experts’ opinionswould be adopted along with
the sparse historical data to confidently estimate the values of these two parameters.
Meanwhile, the way of evaluating the repair costs is somehow different from the situation of
sufficient historical data. In case of lack of historical failure data of the product, we use the
prior joint distribution f(,) to estimate the expected repair cost with time discounting on
CW policy, which is given by
      ( , , , , , ) ( , , , , , ) ( , , , , , )R f R p fC W h f r C W h f r W h f r          , where Wf ,
Wp denote the terms of free warranty and full warranty, CR is the average repair cost per unit, r
is the market interest rate, and is the proportion of repair cost that the manufacturer has to
pay when a breakdown occurs. Here,  0( , , , , , )W h f r  is the expected number of
failures within the term of warranty W0 with time discounting for the prior analysis, and
which is given by
9For the warranty policies of FRW and PRW, the expected repair costs can also be derived
from ( )'( , , , ( , | ), )nR fC W h f D r  and ( )'( , , , ( , | ), )nR pC W h f D r   , respectively.
Note that, in particular, the values of ( )0( , , , ( , | ), )
nW h f D r  and
( )
0'( , , , ( , | ), )
nW h f D r  might not be directly obtained in close form representations, in
such a case, numerical integration would be used instead.
Besides, since the synthetic warranty decisions would involve both the revenue of
sales and the cost of production, the manufacturer has to realize these issues and take them
into account. Therefore, based on the discussions Glickman and Berger (1976), we define the
demand function as

where the parameters a0, a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 can be attained by the marketing survey and
analysis done by the marketing department.
Finally, since the manufacturer cannot change its production scale in a short term, the
manufacturer might adopt other strategies (e.g. overtime or outsourcing) in case that the
market demand is in excess of the normal capacity. In such a situation, the production unit
cost would be presented in a stair type in practice, and which is given by

This programming model deals with the decision problem under CW policy. Since the
duration of warranty is divided into two individual segments and the manufacturer would bear
different expenses, the total expected repair cost during the entire warranty period has to be
separately calculated. The total expected repair cost calculated in Equation (3.3.1) differs
from the previous two models. Equations (3.3.2) and (3.3.3) ensure that the manufacturer can
choose either one of its production scales as the previous models. Equation (3.3.4) specifies
the customers’demand function faced by the manufacturer with the adoption of a CW policy.
Equations (3.3.5) and (3.3.6) ensure that the manufacturer can choose either one of the free
warranty terms and either one of the full warranty terms. Equation (3.3.8) is facilitated to
satisfy the requirement that the duration of PRW is times as FRW in harmony with the
manufacturer’s strategies. Equation (3.3.10) signifies the upper and lower bounds of the repair
proportion paid by the manufacturer.

warranty period whether the manufacturer chooses any one of the warranty policies, FRW,
PRW or CW. Equations (3.4.2) and (3.4.3) ensure that the manufacturer can choose either one
of its production scales as in the previous models. Equation (3.4.4) specifies the customers’
demand function faced by the manufacturer whatever the manufacturer adopts any of the three
warranty policies. Equations (3.4.5)~(3.4.7) ensure that the manufacturer choose the warranty
terms correctly. Equation (3.4.8) is facilitated to satisfy the requirement that the duration of
PRW is times as FRW in harmony with the manufacturer’s strategies if the manufacturer
adopted a PRW or CW policy. Equation (3.4.10) signifies the upper and lower bounds of the
repair proportion paid by the manufacturer. Equations (3.4.11)~(3.4.13) specify that the
decision variables , , , ,fi pj fd pd uX X X X Q are binary. Note that the case when pdX =1 and
fdX =0 indicates that an FRW policy is adopted, the case when pdX =0 and fdX =1 indicates
that a PRW policy is adopted, and the case when pdX =0 and fdX =0 indicates that a CW
policy is adopted. uQ =1 denotes that the production scale u is chosen by the manufacturer.
It is possible that the decision made in accordance with the prior analysis may not be
convincing and acceptable, so the managers usually need more information to justify or polish
their prior decision. In such a case collecting additional data to adjust their prior judgments
about the uncertainties of  and would be plausible. Therefore, the posterior joint
distribution f(,|D(n)) was utilized to proceed the Bayesian updating process. The posterior
analysis is similar to the prior analysis, we only replace )( with )('  in Equation (3.1),
and the optimal posterior decision is made with more serious considerations of both the
experts’ opinionsand the sampling information.

3.3 Analysis with Natural Conjugate Family
Huang and Bier (1998, 1999) proposed natural conjugate prior distributions for the
power law deteriorating model and the exponential deteriorating model for repairable systems
which are of the forms
1 1 1( , ) ( )m m d m czf K e z e
        (3.6)
and
   11 1( , )
Zd m Z c emf K e
  
   , (3.7)
where K is the normalizing factor to ensure each of the distribution sums up to 1. The major
merit of this natural conjugate prior distribution is to facilitate a straightforward analysis
instead of the complicated computation which usually occurs in a Bayesian updating process.
According to Huang and Bier (1998, 1999), the four parameters in Equations (3.5) and (3.6)
(i.e. c, d, m, and z) can be obtained by solving the derived equations of   ,,, .
Suppose that the further investigation is needed, and the optimal sample size n has
been carefully examined and the failure times are collected as D(n)={x1, x2,…, xn}. The
posterior distribution ofandcan be effortlessly gained without further computation by the
property of natural conjugate family, and which are given by

reliability engineering would subjectively determine the deterioration process for the product,
and thus set up the appropriate failure intensity function and its related probability
distribution into the model base through the data formalizing process. However, if a
posterior analysis is desirable with the decision maker, the engineers need to collect the
product’s failure data via some engineering experiments. Besides, the researchers from the
market department should carefully evaluate the demand of the product via the sales data in
the past or from a questionnaire survey of the customers. Note that with the reason of
commercial confidentiality, the engineers, the domain experts, and the market researchers
should only access their own subsystem. With regard to the programming models (excluding
parameters), they were established in the model base by the system programmers right after
the system was developed.
The decision support system is designed for decision makers in the upper management.
It provides integral and complete information for decision making. By exercising the
information in the database and the model base, the decision maker not only can examine all
constructive information but also can use such the information to confidently determine the
optimal decision. However, a computation engine might be needed to deal with the
complexity in obtaining an optimal decision. By way of an application programming interface,
we can easily utilize different computation program objects which were developed by external
software providers or internal programmers. Figure 3.2 illustrates the implementation
architecture of our system.

and can be modeled by the natural conjugate prior distribution with the prior moments
=0.46,  =0.21,  =2.6, and  =0.64.
In order to reduce the frequency of repairs of the facility, the manufacturer adopts a
periodic preventive maintenance policy whose maintenance interval h is 4 months (1/3
year), and the degree of recovery  is 70% over the warranty period and the maintenance
cost MC is $1,000.
According to the market survey and analysis done by the marketing department, the
manager can generalize the demand function and which is given by
0.95 0.9 0.9( , , , ) 27800 500( /1000) 2500 2100 ( )f p f p fQ Q P W W P W W W       .
Furthermore, the production condition is an important factor for the manager in making the
production decision. In particular, the production scale can be divided into three phases, such
as the normal capacity, the overtime capacity, and the outsourcing capacity. The boundaries of
the production scale BvQ are 4,500, 7,000, 9,000 with the unit production costs vC being
$38,500, $40,800, $44,500, respectively.
Other data related to the warranty policy are collected as follows: the options of
warranty policy are FRW, PRW and CW; the possible free warranty terms Wfi are 2, 2.25, 2.5,
2.75, …, 5 years; the possible partial warranty terms Wpj are 4, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75, …, 12 years;
the boundaries of the proportion of repair cost that the manufacturer must payare set to be
between 0.3 and 0.7; the warranty duration ratio is 2; the average repair cost CR of each
breakdown is $900; and the market interest rate r is 5% per year. Table 4.1 summarizes the
problem and lists the numerical values.

Moreover, to enhance the reliability of the prior decision, the manufacturer may need
to perform a posterior analysis. However, the question “how many samples would be
needed?”is essential for the manufacturer while deciding the suitable sampling plan. In view
of this, a preposterior analysis would be required to assist the determination of the optimal
sample size. Equation (3.14) can be facilitated to derive the optimal n*, but it is too
complicated to cope with. Fortunately, an approach with Monte Carlo simulation and curve
fitting technique proposed by Muller and Parmigiani (1995) can be performed in dealing with
the complexity, and the ENGS with respect to n is therefore given by
ˆˆ( ) 138,079,464(1 ) 138,079,464 720,000aENGS n bn n    , where aˆ and bˆ are the

. Since we have
aˆ =0.0261914 and bˆ = 1.35905×1011 by estimating from the simulated data, the Monte Carlo
sampling gives n*= 10.4515. In compliance with the optimal sample size of 10, the ten
successive breakdown times from another similar product are collected, which are 1.094,
1.743, 2.240, 2.462, 2.942, 3.096, 3.141, 3.330, 3.541, and 3.641 (years). As mentioned in
Section 3.3, the manufacturer can thus proceed with the posterior analysis, and the
computation results are summarized in Table 4.3.

shortening the warranty terms and lowing the price simultaneously is more advantageous
when the increase of the warranty cost goes up within the ranges of +2.5%~+5%,
+7.5%~+10%, and +15%~+20%. (2) If the decrease in the revenue by shortening the term of
the warranty is greater than the decrease in the warranty cost, then it is inappropriate to
shorten the terms of the warranty while the warranty cost would be expected to go up in the
future. In such a situation, keeping the original warranty and raising the price should be more
advantageous because lightly raising the price could slow down the decrease in total profits. It
differs from the general idea that both shortening the term of the warranty and raising the
price can solve the problem when the warrant costs increases. Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show that if
the expected warranty cost goes up within these ranges of 0%~+2.5%, +5%~+7.5%, and
+10%~+15%, the manufacturer should keep the original warranty and set the price within the
ranges of $88,593~$88,677, $84,878~$85,190, and $81,309~$81,837, respectively. Similarly,
the manufacturer should make a reverse decision if the warranty cost was expected to go
down. Figures 4.3 and 4.4 show the impacts on the sales and the profits when the warranty
cost was changing. Tables 4.4 show the impacts on the terms of warranty, the price of product,
the number of sales, and the total profit, respectively when the warranty cost was changing.

improper decision of mistakenly extending the terms of warranty. Furthermore, misjudging
 and  may result in more risky decisions. Therefore, the decision maker should be
very cautious with the subjective judgments. Figures 4.5~4.12 and Tables 4.5 and 4.6 show
the outcomes of the change of  ,  ,  ,  .

12 月 9 日開始當天早上九點，大會主持人開始致詞與演講，希望大會的參與學者都
能享受這次盛會，並強調這次的會議的審稿非常嚴格只有近三分之一的投稿文章能夠接
受，若與會的學者能夠充分做意見的交換，將有助於未來的研究方向。
當大會主持人致詞與演講完畢後，與會同仁稍做休息，在早上十一點左右開始大會
的各個議程。
在 12 月 10 日晚上大會安排了晚宴，與會學者在此一同用餐與參觀港口風景，這是
本次研討會參與同仁最放鬆的時刻了。
在 12 月 10 日晚上參加大會晚宴之後，由於後面沒有本人的議程，而且 12 月 11 日
的議程之議題，與本人的研究領域比較不接近。因此本人在隔天返抵國門。

參加會議經過
我與一同參加會議的同事在 12 月 7 日晚間 6 點左右抵達香港，搭乘計程車
到大會建議的飯店。在用完晚餐以後，當天晚上我與同事們討論如何與國外學者
交換心得與意見，他們建議我先以相近研究領域的學者做一些議題的討論，當其
他學者能夠瞭解我們的專業與研究領域後，才能放開心防充分的交換心得與意
見。
在 12 月 8 日下午 1:30，大會開始啟動報到的程序，現場工作人員開始受理
研討會參加人員的登記並發放會議議程資料與紀念品。並且很熱心為我們指引會
議中各議程的時間與地點。
由於我們的報告議程是排在 12 月 9 日，也就是大會開幕的第二天。因此我
3在 12 月 10 日晚上參加大會晚宴之後，由於後面沒有本人的議程，而且 12
月 11 日的議程之議題，與本人的研究領域比較不接近。因此本人在隔天返抵國
門。
參加會議心得與收穫
總結此次學術之旅，共可歸結出幾點重要結論與收穫：
(1)此次參加這種大型的國際研討會，擴大了本人的國際觀，有助於增廣未
來研究的國際視野，也讓本人瞭解與國際學者交流意見的重要性。
(2)增加語言交流的經驗：此次參加國際研討會才發現本人的英語發音並不
純正，以至於在與人交換意見時發生了一點障礙。因此往後本人在口音校
正上需多加努力，才能面對未來學術交流之國際化需求。
(3)香港是國際化的大都市，此次參加研討會才發現，原來香港最令人稱羨
的不僅是都市的建設，而是市民的守法精神。在路上你可以發現市容相當
整潔，而且市民的秩序非常良好。這實在值得我們台灣學習與借鏡。
