Abstract: We report on the first fabrication of a Cr-doped fiber using a drawing-tower method 
with Cr:YAG as the core of the preform. The Cr-doped fibers have potential for use as fiber 
amplifier to cover the bandwidths in the whole 1.3 – 1.6 µm range.

1. Introduction 
The breakthrough technology in dry fiber fabrication has opened the possibility for using fiber bandwidths all the 
way from 1.3 to 1.6 µm. The usable spectral band for the number of channels in a wavelength-division-multiplexing 
(WDM) system strongly depends on the gain bandwidth of the fiber amplifiers. For example, the well-known 
erbium (Er)-doped fiber amplifier provided gain in the C band (1530-1565 nm), the L band (1570-1605 nm), and 
even the S band (1450-1520 nm) which totaled 140 nm usable spectral bands. The other types of fiber amplifiers 
such as thulium (Tm)-doped[1], produced gain in the S band (1450-1520 nm) and praseodymium (Pr)-doped[2], 
operated gain in the O band (1260-1360 nm). However, the gain bandwidths of the Er-doped, Tm-doped, and Pr-
doped fiber amplifiers cannot fully cover the whole 1.3 – 1.6 µm range with a single fiber amplifier. Therefore, it is 
interesting to develop a single fiber amplifier which can operate the wide bandwidth of the 1.3 – 1.6 µm emission. 
The transition-metal-doped materials such as Ni2+ ions[3] and Cr4+ ions[4] have shown broadband 1.3 – 1.6 µm 
emissions. Recently, a Cr4+:YAG crystal fiber amplifier has been demonstrated by use of a codrawing laser-heated 
pedestal growth (LHPG) method[4-6]. Up to a 10 dB of gross gain at a wavelength of 1.52 µm was achieved at a 
pump power of 0.83 W[4]. The Cr4+-doped fiber amplifier can be employed in the whole 1.3 – 1.6 µm ranges. 
However, it is difficult to fabricate the core diameter less than 10 µm by LHPG method. Furthermore, the growth of 
the Cr4+-doped fibers is slow (about 10 mm/min) and the uniformity of the core diameter varies in lengths. 
Therefore, it may be difficult to integrate the LHPG fabricated Cr4+-doped fibers with the standard single-mode 
fibers.  
In this study, we propose and fabricate a Cr-doped fiber by employing a commercial drawing-tower method, 
which has the advantage of better core diameter uniformity for splicing with the standard single-mode fiber and 
broadband WDM couplers for lightwave system applications. Therefore, the Cr-doped fibers may be used as optical 
fiber amplifier to cover the fiber bandwidths in the whole 1.3 – 1.6 µm range. 
 
2. Fabrication 
The Cr-doped YAG preform was fabricated using a rod-in-tube (RIT) method[7]. A silica rod with a hole was first 
obtained by using a drill. The RIT technique consisted of inserting a Cr4+-doped YAG crystal rod[8] into a silica rod 
which were assembled into a preform. The silica rod became the cladding when the ensemble preform was drawn 
into the fiber by using the drawing-tower method. Fig. 1 shows the Cr4+-doped YAG preform. The diameter and 
length of the Cr-doped YAG crystal were 5 mm and 5 cm, respectively. The diameter of the preform was 60 mm in 
order that the ratio of the core diameter to the cladding diameter was 10 to 125 after the fiber drawing.

4.  Conclusion 
In summary, we have first successively demonstrated a 10-km length of the Cr-doped fibers by using commercial 
drawing-tower method. The Cr-doped fibers had an 8-µm core diameter and a 125-µm cladding diameter. The 
refractive index was ncore=1.477 with ∆ =1.49 %. The Cr4+ fluorescence spectrum showed a broadband emission 
from 1.1 to 1.6 µm. The advantages of using the drawing tower to fabricate the Cr-doped fibers are to have better 
control the core diameter and the fiber uniformity, which is beneficial when integrated with the standard single-
mode fibers and broadband WDM couplers for lightwave communication systems. The Cr-doped fibers have 
potential for use as an optical fiber amplifier to cover the fiber bandwidths in the whole 1.3 to 1.6 µm range.

1.  Introduction  
The breakthrough technology in dry fiber fabrication has opened the possibility for using 
fiber bandwidths all the way from 1.3 to 1.6 μm. The usable spectral band for the number of

types of fiber amplifiers such as thulium (Tm)-doped [1], produced gains in the S band 
(1450-1520 nm) and praseodymium (Pr)-doped [2] operated gains in the O band (1260-1360 
nm). However, the gain bandwidths of the Er-doped, Tm-doped, and Pr-doped fiber 
amplifiers cannot fully cover the whole 1.3-1.6 μm range with a single fiber amplifier. 
Therefore, it may be interesting to develop a single fiber amplifier which can operate the wide 
bandwidth of the 1.3-1.6 μm emission. 
The transition-metal-doped materials such as Ni2+ ions [3-4] and Cr4+ ions [5-6] have 
shown broadband 1.3-1.6 μm emissions. Recently, a Cr4+:YAG crystal fiber amplifier has 
been demonstrated by the use of a codrawing laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) method 
[7-9]. Up to 10 dB of gross gain at a wavelength of 1.52 μm was achieved at a pump power of 
0.83 W [7]. The Cr4+-doped fiber amplifier can be employed in the whole 1.3-1.6 μm range. 
However, it is difficult to fabricate a core diameter less than 10 μm by following the LHPG 
method. Furthermore, the growth of the Cr4+-doped fibers is slow (about 10 mm/min) and the 
uniformity of the core diameter varies in lengths. Therefore, it may be difficult to integrate 
the LHPG fabricated Cr4+-doped fibers with the standard single-mode fibers for lightwave 
system applications.  
In this paper, we propose and fabricate a Cr-doped fiber by employing a commercial 
drawing-tower method which has a better core diameter uniformity for adiabatic 
transmission.  Since the core size is about the same as that of a standard single-mode fiber, a 
low-loss fusion splice can readily be done. The major benefit of the Cr-doped fiber is a 
broadband emission from 1.2 to 1.55 μm which has not been realized by using currently 
available fiber amplifiers. This broadband Cr-doped fiber may be used as a new fiber 
amplifier to cover the fiber bandwidths in the whole low-loss window of a silica fiber to 
further increase the transmission capacity of the WDM system for lightwave communication 
applications. 
2.  Fabrication  
The Cr4+-doped YAG preform was fabricated using a rod-in-tube (RIT) method [10]. A silica 
rod had a hole first drilled in the center of one end and tapered the other end to form a cone 
shape. Then the sample was inserted with a Cr4+-doped YAG crystal rod [11] to constitute the 
preform. The silica rod became the cladding when the assembled preform was drawn into 
fiber by using the drawing-tower method. Figure 1(a) shows a schematic diagram of a Cr4+-
doped YAG preform. The diameter and the length of the Cr4+-doped YAG crystal were 5 mm 
and 5 cm, respectively. The diameter of the preform was 62.5 mm in order for the ratio of the 
core to the cladding diameter to become 10/125 after the fiber drawing. A photo image of the 
fabricated Cr4+-doped YAG preform is shown in Fig. 1(b).  
A commercial drawing tower with a 28-m height and a carbon-resistant furnace was used 
to fabricate the Cr-doped fibers. The material properties of Cr4+:YAG and SiO2 used in this 
study are listed in Table I. Due to the different thermal expansion coefficients between the 
Cr4+-doped YAG crystal and the silica, as indicated in Table I, the heating temperature was 
kept gradual and slow proceeded. The preform was loaded into the center of the furnace first, 
and then the temperature was augmented from 1100 oC to 2150 oC with a ramp rate of 20

It is well known that Cr ions have several oxidation states such as Cr2+, Cr3+, Cr4+, Cr5+, 
and Cr6+. Cr ions are likely to exist in the stable form of +3 oxidation state and are hardly 
found in tetravalent coordination state in normal glasses.  The stable +4 oxidation state of Cr 
ions has been found in aluminate, alumino-silicate, and gallate glasses, which results in the 
absorption spectrum at ranges of 600-1000 nm [12]. Therefore, to measure the fluorescence 
spectrum of Cr-doped fibers, the Ti-sapphire laser with a wavelength of 700-1000 nm was 
used as the light source. In Fig. 3(a), the fluorescence spectrum of the Cr-doped fiber was 
excited by 800-nm in wavelength with an initial power of 200 mW. The emission peak was at 
1 μm, which is similar to the typical Cr3+ fluorescence spectrum in SiO2 glass [13]. The 
shoulder was extended to 1.6 μm, which should be attributed to the Cr4+ ions [13-14]. Both 
Cr3+ and Cr4+ ions coexist in Cr-doped fibers and the Cr3+ ion is dominant. Further evidence 
can be shown in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) where the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectra 
of the Cr-doped fiber are through 6.1-cm and 8.3-cm propagation lengths, respectively. In 
Fig. 3(b), the central wavelength of the ASE spectrum was 1.15 μm. In contrast to Fig. 3(b), 
the central wavelength of the ASE spectrum was shifted to a longer wavelength at 1.32 μm, as 
shown in Fig. 3(c). This is due to the re-absorption of Cr3+ fluorescence which causes the re-
emission of Cr4+ ions to become apparent when the pumping light travels through a longer 
length of the Cr-doped fiber. The dip of the ASE spectrum at the wavelength of 1.4 μm in 
Fig. 3(c) was the absorption of OH- ions which was caused by the cooling process when the 
preform was drilling. Therefore, an improvement in the fabrication of the Cr-doped fibers to 
reduce the OH- ions is necessary.
