Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Statement of Problem
The evolution processes of bed configuration in the alluvial rivers are abundant
and complicated. The bedform of natural rivers may be generated by the forcing effect
of the channel geometry, e.g., width variation and curvature, and any disturbances that
trigger free deformation on the riverbed. The former may yield the stationary forced
bar formation and the latter may induce the free migrating alternate bars. In natural
rivers, forced and free bars often coexist and interact with each other, as shown in
Figure 1-1. The flowfield and morphology of a river are unsteady and dynamic, and
thus affect river management issues such as channel training, flood defense, riverine
habitat conservation/restoration, and transport of pollutants. In order to accurately
predict the evolution of dynamic bedform in natural channels, a better understanding
of the influences of these forcing effects on free migrating alternate bars is necessary.
The aims of this study are to develop a two-dimensional (2D) finite element (FE)
morphodynamic model and systematically investigate these problems. The results of
this study may provide useful information guiding more dynamic and comprehensive
practices of river engineering.

channels with variable width was unstable and irregular, and characterized by an
average value in each experiment. It degrades the reliability of his experimental
analysis. A perturbation method with linear stability theory was used to analyze this
issue. As a result, the suppression of alternate bars in channels with width variation
was characterized by a correction factor. It may ignore the local process of alternate
bars in the wide and narrow sections of the channel. It is necessary to have a power
tool to capture the coexistence of free and forced bars. Numerical experiments are
performed in this study to investigate the influences of forcing effect on free bars.
1.2.2 Morphodynamic model
While 3D morphodynamic models can be used to study in detail the evolution of
river morphology, 2D models are more efficient in practical applications. A number of
researchers have devoted to the development of 2D morphodynamic models. Finite
difference (FD) schemes have been commonly used to investigate the alluvial bend
morphology and meandering channels. Koch and Folkstra (1981) applied a simplified
2D model to curved alluvial flumes of constant circular bends. Struiksma (1985) used
a 2D FD model to reproduce the observed patterns of scour and deposition along a
meandering reach of the Waal River. Struiksma et al. (1985) simulated the sour and
deposition measured in the laboratory curved flumes. Shimizu and Itakura (1989)
modeled the bed evolution in a sine-generated meandering channel. Kassem and
Chaudhry (2002) applied a boundary fitted FD model to simulate some of the alluvial
bend experiments of Koch and Folkstra (1981) and Struiksma et al. (1985).
The shortcoming of 2D morphodynamic models is that the momentum transport
by secondary currents of 3D flow structures is neglected (Shimizu et al., 1990). The
streamline curvature is employed to reflect the effect of secondary flow for correcting
the direction of sediment transport. The relation is expressed as follows (Engelund,
1-5
the simulated results are in good agreement with the experimental results (Lanzoni,
2000) and the weakly nonlinear solutions (Colombini et al., 1987; Schielen et al.,
1993). However, different types of disturbance would lead to different bar
characteristics. More recently, Bernini et al. (2006) simulated the generation of free
bars in a straight, rectangular channel with both supercritical and subcritical uniform
flows using the ADI scheme. The results were used to study the effect of gravity due
to the transverse bed slope on the equilibrium geometric and kinematic bar
characteristics. Although Defina (2003) and Bernini et al. (2006) successfully
simulated the generation of free bars in straight, rectangular channels and
demonstrated qualitatively the agreement with experimental data and analytical
solutions, none has incorporated the effect of secondary flow and simulated the case
of variable-width channel.
1.3 Scope of Study
The main scope of this study is to conduct numerical experiments to investigate
the influences of the forcing effect on free bars. Finally, the conclusions drawn from
this study and suggestions for future studies are provided.
The proposed morphodynamic model is composed of the hydrodynamic and bed
evolution equations, both of them belong to the hyperbolic equation. The streamline
upwind Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) scheme is applied to both the hydrodynamic and bed
evolution equations to overcome the defect for which the traditional Galerkin scheme
may fail in the hyperbolic equation. The details what numerical models execute are
described in chapter 2. The vertically averaged (VA) model or vertically averaged and
moment (VAM) model (Vasquez, 2005) could be used in the hydrodynamic model.
The applicability of the VA and VAM models in the morphodynamic model are
validated and their accuracies are examined in chapter 3. In present study the

Mathematical Model
In this chapter, the governing equations of flow dynamics and bed evolution,
along with their closure relations are described first. Then, the two-dimensional (2D)
finite element (FE) morphodynamic model and the upwind scheme are presented.
2.1 Governing Equations of Flow Dynamics Model
The vertical average (VA) model is used in present study. It is derived from the
fundamental full three-dimensional (3D) Reynolds equations. The full 3D Reynolds
equations, including a continuity equation and three momentum equations, are given

Exner equation. The processes involved in the Exner equation are bedform translation
and diffusion (Lisle et al., 1997, 2001; Cui et al., 2003b), which describe different

2.3 Finite Element Method
2.3.1 Streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin scheme
The term ‘upwind’originates from the manner in which the discretization is
applied depending on the direction of wave propagation. This wave can be the
characteristic waves of the conservation laws or disturbance wave (Giraldo, 1995).
Godunov (1959) introduced the idea that the information from the exact local solution
to the Euler equations could be included in the discretization for the purposes of
computational studies. He applied this method to the finite volume (FV) method.
Brooks and Hughes (1982) first applied this concept to the finite element (FE) method
to solve the convection-dominated flow.
Dendy (1974) and Wahlbin (1974) derived the dissipative Gelerkin scheme to
solve the first-order hyperbolic equations. Katopodes (1984) applied the dissipative
Galerkin scheme to the non-conservation form of de St. Venant equations and

the resulting equation with a specified weighting function and integrating it over an
element domain e leads to the general form of the equation for streamline upwind

scheme is adopted here (Hicks and Steffler, 1992; Ghamry, 1999), which gives

The eigenvalues of (2-20) are the characteristic celerity of the system of equations
(2-3) (Hicks and Steffler, 1992), the reason why it is called ‘characteristic dissipative
Gelerkin’scheme. For example, the eigenvalues of the advection matrices of the VA
model, 0U , 0 wU gD , and 0 wU gD , are the characteristic celerity of (2-3). To
calculate the inverse of 2 2x yA A in (2-17), the numerical procedure based on the
Cayley-Hamilton theorem is employed (Hoger and Carlson, 1984).
2.3.2 Applying CDG scheme to bed evolution model
While the CDG scheme has been successfully applied to flow dynamics models,
to date applying the CDG scheme to solve the sediment continuity equation has never
been carried out due to the complexities involved in the formulation (Vasquez, 2005).
Because the morphodynamic model is unable to capture the advection mechanism of
bed evolution without incorporating an upwind scheme, some simplifications must be
made in the formulation. As such, equations (2-3) and (2-4) are modified as

2.4 Model Implementation
To implement the morphodynamic model, the flow is assumed to be quasi-steady.
The time derivative terms in the governing equations of the VA or VAM model can be
neglected, implying that the flow adapts to the altering bed topography immediately.
Such a morphodynamic model is essentially a decoupled one. The flow, sediment, and
bed topography computations are executed iteratively with the following procedure:
Step 1: Solve the flow dynamics model with the given bed topography.
Step 2: Evaluate the sediment transport rates with the calculated bed shear stress.
Step 3: Compute the bed topography at the next time using the bed evolution model.
Step 4: Go back to step 1 with the updated bed topography.
Implementations of the flow dynamics and bed evolution models are described below.
Implementing the flow dynamics model with the CDG scheme is described here.
The weak form of the finite element equation and boundary conditions are introduced
first. The Newton-Raphson algorithm is then adopted to solve the resulting system of
equations.
Equation (2-3) may be rewritten in the form of (2-16a) as the following:

Model Validation
In this chapter, the simulation results of the flow dynamics and morphodynamic
models are validated. The flow dynamics model is validated with the experimental
data of a variable-width channel. The morphodynamics model is validated with the
data of force bars (side bars and central bars), free migrating alternate bars and a
simulation case of coexistence of free and forced bars.
3.1 Validation of Flow Dynamics Model
3.1.1 Channel with variable width
Bittner (1994) conducted a series of experiments in channels with variable width.
One of these experiments, run C1-11, in which depths of flow were measured over the
developed bedforms (side bars), was used here to validate the flow dynamics models.
The sidewall of the channel was sinusoidal, with its width variation described by

half-width = 0.2 m; 0b width perturbation = 0.075 m; cwavelength of channel
width variation = 1.6 m.
The simultaneously measured final bed topography and flow depth in the four
cycles of the channel width variations are shown in Figure 3-1, where both the bed
deformation and flow depth exhibit repeated patterns. To compute the flow, the final
bed deformations in these four cycles were averaged and used as the input fixed-bed
topography to the flow dynamics models (Figure 3-2), leading to the repeated flow
patterns in the four cycles.

3.2Validation of Bed Evolution Model
The bed evolution model is validated with four types of bedforms, including two
of forced bars (side bars and central bars), one of free migrating alternate bars and one
of coexistence of free and forced bars. These results suggest that the CDG scheme
may be applied to the sediment continuity equation without incorporating any
artificial smoothing (Vasquez et al., 2007).
3.2.1 Forced bars–Side bars
The bed topography measured in run C1-11 of Bittner (1994) is used to validate
the bedform of side bars. The geometry of the channel has been described in 3.1.1, but
the computational domain is changed as shown in Figure 3-9, which consists of a total
of 2,067 nodes and 3,760 elements. In addition to the two extra cycles included in this
domain, resulting in a total of eight cycles, the upstream and downstream reaches are
extended, where the bed elevations remain fixed. This ensures the conservation of
sediment in the channel and that bed evolutions at the upstream and downstream ends
would not be affected by unstable flows (Defina, 2003; Zech et al., 2006).
The VA model is used for the computation of flow dynamics. The boundary
condition imposed at the upstream is the specified unit discharge 0q 0.0073 m2/s.
No-penetration condition is used at the sidewalls. Initially, flow depths are all set as
0.022 m, the bed is flat with a slope of 0.004. The helical flow coefficient a3. The
sediment influx is calculated with the flow conditions at the extended upstream reach.
The experimental result and computed bed topography of side bars are shown in
Figure 3-10, where satisfactory agreement is demonstrated. To further compare the
bed deformation patterns at different locations, the cycle-averaged measurements and
the computed bed topography at four specified sections of a width-variation cycle are

3.2.2 Forced bars–Central bars
A series of experiments were conducted in a variable-width channel by Wu and
Yeh (2005). One of the experiments, S6, is used here to validate the simulated result
of central bars. The sinusoidal variation of the channel width is described by

where *B is the channel half-width; 0B is the mean channel half-width whose
value was 0.16 m; A is the perturbation amplitude whose value was 0.156; c is
the wavelength of the channel whose value was 3.35 m; x is the coordinate in the
longitudinal direction. The computational domain is shown in Figure 3-12, which
consists of a total of 2,457 nodes and 4,200 elements.
The vertical average (VA) model is used for flow computations and compared
with the result from vertical average and moment with assumed linear vertical
velocity profile (VAM-linear) and assumed quadratic vertical velocity profile
(VAM-quadratic). The advantage of VAM model is its ability to capture the secondary
flow without additional streamline curvature correlation. The boundary condition
imposed at the upstream is the inflow unit discharge 0q  0.0197 m2/s.
No-penetration of water flow is imposed at the sidewalls. The roughness height sK
is 0.004; the helical flow coefficient a is 5. The initial flow depth is given by
wD 0.0049 m, the unit discharge xQ is set equal to 0q . The initial flat bed has a
slope of 0.003. In both the upstream and downstream extended reaches the fixed-bed
condition is imposed, the sediment transport rate in the upstream extended reach is
used as the sediment influx to the variable-width channel.

disturbance is given by the following expression (Defina, 2003):
     0, cos / 2 sin 2 /b b bz x y A y B x    (3-3)
where bz bed disturbance; bA perturbation amplitude; 0B half-channel width;
bwavelength of bed disturbance. The values of bA and b are 0.4 cm and 7 m,
respectively. Equation (3-3) was used by Defina (2003) to create a single bump that
only covered half the channel width, but an initial disturbance covering the whole
width (shown in Figure 3-18) is used in this study to accelerate the bar growth.
The VA model is used here for the flow computation. The boundary condition at
the upstream is the inflow unit discharge 0q 0.002 m2/s. The inflow sediment
transport rate is calculated with Equation (2-16) using the hydraulic condition in the
extended upstream fixed-bed reach, with the roughness height sK 0.0048 m. The
calculated sediment transport rate is 2.9110-5 m2 /s, which is slightly greater than
2.610-5 m2 /s measured in the flume. The no-penetration condition is imposed at the
sidewalls. The initial bed is flat with a slope of 0.00452. The initial flow depth is
assumed equal to 0.044 m; the unit discharge in the x-direction is 0.002 m2/s; the unit
discharge in the y-direction is zero.
The simulated evolution of the alternate bars is shown in Figure 3-19. In the first
two hours, the initial disturbance migrates downstream and triggers the formation of
alternate bars. The upstream alternate bars continue to grow, migrate downstream, and
trigger the alternate bars further downstream. After three hours, the diagonal fronts of
the alternate bars become more obvious. The bed returns to flat after the train of
alternate bars passes by. The bar height, defined as the difference between the extreme
elevations in the left and right halves of a cross section, grows with time, as shown in
Figure 3-20. The growth rates are steep in the first two hours, and then become mild.
The height of the first generated bar, denoted as bar No.1, almost reaches a steady

3.2.4 Coexistence of free and forced bars
The validated case of coexistence of free and forced bars is chosen from one of a
series of experiments conducted in a variable-width channel by Wu and Yeh (2005),
labeled as F2. The experimental bed topography is central bar paved by an alternative
pattern in the channel, as shown in Figure 3-19, thus deduced that the distorted central
bar is result of coexistence of free and forced bars. The sinusoidal variation of the
channel width is described by Eq. 3-2 with A equal to 0.156 and c equal to 3.35m.
The geometry of the channel is the same as prescribed in S6 case, and the
computation domain is the same as shown in Figure 3-9 which consists of a total of
2,457 nodes and 4,200 elements.
The vertical average model is used for flow dynamic model. Required
computation condition include the roughness height sK is 0.004, the helical flow
coefficient a is 5 and a slope of the initial flat bed is 0.005. The boundary condition
imposed at the upstream is the inflow unit discharge 0q  0.0137 m2/s.
No-penetration of water flow is imposed at the sidewalls. The initial flow depth is
given by wD 0.00313 m, the unit discharge xQ is set equal to 0q . In both the
upstream and downstream extended reaches the fixed-bed condition is imposed, the
sediment transport rate in the upstream extended reach is used as the sediment influx
to the variable-width channel.
The computed bed topography and the experimental result are shown in Figure
3-19, where satisfactory agreement between the experimental and computed results is
demonstrated. The measured bed topography have distorted bullet-shape fronts, which
are similar to central bars superposed by an alternative pattern and are captured more
successfully by the numerical models. To further demonstrate this, the comparison of
experimental measurement and numerical computation result are made with the lateral

Figure 4-2 A bed elevation disturbance imposed at the upstream extended reach

The coexistence of free and forced bars gives rise to the nonlinear interactions
(Blondeaux and Seminara, 1985; Tubino and Seminara, 1990; Whiting and Dietrich, 1993).
Such interactions may suppress the development of free bars (Kinoshita and Miwa, 1974;
Tubino and Seminara, 1990). To quantify this forcing effect on free bars, the equilibrium
forced bar components were subtracted from the mixed free-forced bar patterns (Figures
4-3(c)-(d)). The resulting free-bar components were compared with those forming in the
straight channels. The discussions here include the height, wavelength, and celerity of the
free bars. The bar height is defined as the difference between the extreme bed elevations in
the left and right halves of a cross section, the profile of bar height is shown in Figure 4-4.
Downstream of the initial disturbance area, peaks of the bar height profile are labeled as
Bar01, Bar02, and so on. The first five peaks were used as the target bars in the present
study because they emerged at early stages of the numerical simulations and exhibited
sufficient temporal and spatial evolutions. The wavelength is defined as the distance
between the negative peaks immediately up- and down-stream of a target bar. These
definitions offer an advantage of translating the 3D bar configurations into 2D bar
characteristics.

4.3 Effect of width variation on free bars
To quantify the effect of width variation on free bars, the height, wavelength, and
celerity of the target bars were normalized by the corresponding values in the straight
channels such that the ratios represent the relative effect of width variation. Moreover, the
cumulative forcing effect is expressed using the number of cycles experienced by the
target bars given that the variation of channel width is periodic. These treatments are used
in the subsequent analyses.
The train of free bars migrates downstream meanwhile induces new bars further
downstream. The induced free bars have characteristics similar to upstream ones and
transmit those characteristics to downstream. Shown in Figures 4-9 and 4-10 are the
evolutions of bar height ratio as a function of the number of width variation cycles, where
the number of cycles experienced by each target bar is shifted (centered around Bar03)
such that the resonant stages are all overlapped. In Figure 4-9(a), for example, all bars in
B15A01W06 reached the final resonant stages after cycle 9. The resonant state of Bar01 is
the longest, indicating that Bar01 reached the resonant stage first, followed by Bar02, and
so on (Figure 4-8). For B09 series, however, none of the target bars has reached the
equilibrium state (see Figure 4-7). In Figure 4-10(a), the quasi-resonant stages are only
observed in B09A01W08 for Bar02~05 while Bar01 exhibited a decaying trend.
Variations of the wavelength and celerity of the free bars are highly related to the
variation of bar height (Defina, 2003). The sensitivities of the wavelength and celerity to
the forcing effect are, however, different. In Figures 4-11(a) and 4-13(a), for example, the
bar height ratios range between 0.9~1.1 while the wavelength and celerity ratios range
between 0.99~1.01 and 0.8~1.3, respectively. The bar celerity seems to be more sensitive
to the forcing effect than the wavelength (Whiting and Dietrich, 1993).

4.4 Bed shear stress on coexisting free and forced bars
The driving force of free bar migration is the alternate pattern of bed shear stress
distributed in the channel. The alternate pattern of bed shear stress distribution originates
from the bed elevation perturbation and flow instability in a channel with erodible bottom.
Figures 4-16(a) and (c) demonstrate distributions of bed shear stress in straight channels
where free bars developed. Similar to the alternate bar distributions, the distributions of
bed shear stress also exhibit diagonal fronts. The lowest shear stress is located at the scour
while the highest shear stress is at the fill. The alternate patterns of bed shear stress are
attributed to the alternate bedform, which in turn alter the bed erosion and deposition and
subsequent bar development and migration. In our numerical experiments, however, free
bars were induced by the initial bed disturbance. Upstream of the initial disturbance is a
flat bed and uniformly distributed bed shear stress, which would propagate downstream
and gradually eliminate free bars. For example, Bar01 in B09A00W00 was decaying after
280 minutes. Variations of channel width may cause the redistribution of bed shear stress,
as shown in Figures 4-16(b) and (d). Figure 4-17 shows the ratio of mean bed shear stress
acting on the coexisting free and forced bars to that acting on the forced bars, along with
the corresponding celerity ratio (B15A03W06, Bar01). The celerity and bed shear stress
are out of phase, implying that a time lag exists between the peaks of the bed shear stress
and celerity. This has been observed in a previous experimental study (Whiting and
Dietrich, 1993) that investigated bar migration through bends and provides a direct
support for the effect associated with the interactions of free and forced bars.

4.5 Quantitative forcing effect on equilibrium bar height
The forcing effect of width variation can be quantified using the amplitude and
wavelength of the wall sinuosity. The forcing effect of the variable-width channel can be
represented by two factors. The first is the wavy factor, defined as the ratio of amplitude to
wavelength, representing the waviness of the channel wall. The second is the amplitude
factor, defined as the ratio of amplitude to channel width, representing the degree of width
perturbation. The product of the wavy factor and amplitude factor defines the forcing
factor. The equilibrium bar heights in B15 series are used as the outcomes corresponding
to the forcing effect of width variation. Shown in Figure 4-18 is the ratio of equilibrium
bar height varying as a function of the forcing factor. The relation between the ratio of
equilibrium bar height and the forcing factor can be described by the regression equation
given in Figure 4-18, with a satisfactory coefficient of determination R2=0.97. Figure 4-18
also demonstrates the suppression of free bars by the forcing effect as the equilibrium bar
height declines with the increasing forcing factor.

forced bars and then migrated downstream, the original characteristics of the
forced bars that were left behind would recover.
2. Evolutions of free bars in the variable-width channels exhibited wavy patterns of
bar growth in response to the local variations of channel width. The trends of bar
growth in the variable-width channels are similar to those in the straight ones
when the forcing effects are small. Decay of the bar growth was accelerated in
the variable-width channels.
3. The evolutions of bar height ratio as a function of the number of width variation
cycles, where the number of cycles experienced by each target bar is shifted such
that the resonant stages are all overlapped, revealed that the induced free bars
have characteristics similar to upstream ones and transmit those characteristics to
further downstream.
4. The sensitivities of the bar wavelength and celerity to the forcing effect are
different. The bar celerity seems to be more sensitive to the forcing effect than
the wavelength is.
5. The bar wavelengths modulate in the same manner as in the channels with large
wavelengths only at early stages, but tend to inverse at middle and later stages. It
appears that modulation of bar wavelength varies with the stage of wavelength
development when the bar wavelengths are presented as the multiplication of
channel wavelength.
6. The alternate patterns of bed shear stress are attributed to the alternate bedform,
which in turn alter the bed erosion and deposition processes and subsequent bar
development and migration. The flat extended bed and uniformly distributed bed
shear stress upstream of the initial disturbance would propagate downstream and
gradually eliminate free bars.

2above the water surface. Five 8-mm plastic beads (numbered as 1 to 5) were hung from a 30-cm
horizontal bar and driven by a variable-speed motor to make circular motion at the water
surface. Such a setting was to assure that particle motion was strictly in a 2D configuration with
no vertical motion involved. All beads were partially submerged and thus simultaneously seen
by the two cameras.
FIG. 1. Overall view of the experimental setup. Rotation of tracer particles is driven by a
variable-speed motor. Particle motion is simultaneously imaged by a down-looking
CCD camera and an up-looking DIDSON acoustic camera.
A total of nine runs were performed, with the rotation speeds ranging from 3.1 to 14.5
rpm. In each run, rotation of tracer particles was maintained for 60 seconds. The video
sequences of particle motion were acquired using both cameras. The acoustic camera operated
at 10 fps. The 96×512 pixels polar-coordinate images (averagely 12.8×2.5 mm2/pixel) were
internally mapped to the Cartesian coordinates, with an output resolution of 505×560 pixels
(2.5×2.1 mm2/pixel). The CCD camera operated at 30 fps, with an image resolution of
720×480 pixels (0.85×1 mm2/pixel). After all runs, a calibration grid board was placed on the
observation area and imaged by both cameras. The calibration images were used to establish
the relations between the image and physical coordinates.
B. Image processing
The procedure for image processing includes: (1) noise removal, (2) particle positioning,
and (3) geometric calibration. To enhance the quality of the images, the background noises
and low-intensity noises were removed first. The second step was to position the particle
centers by convolving the image with a Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter.5,6 Local peaks of the
convolved images were then sought and the position of each particle was refined to a
sub-pixel accuracy using a linear interpolation surface.7 The third step was to determine a
conversion matrix that allows for a transformation between the image and physical
coordinates. Such a perspective projection8 was carried out using the calibration grid images
of known physical coordinates. Particle trajectories can be traced from a series of images, and
the velocities can be estimated by registering particle displacements over short time intervals.

6each tracer particle are normalized with the corresponding mean velocities AV and OV . The
difference between the normalized velocities, OOAA VVVV //  , is then used as a quantitative
measure of the bias induced by the difference in the spatial resolutions of the two cameras.
The values of OOAA VVVV //  are shown in Fig. 5 for a range of nondimensionalized
mean particle velocities LO VV / , where OV is used to represent the mean particle velocity,
and LV threshold particle velocity for the acoustic camera, defined as the lowest velocity
that can be sensed. The value of LV is taken to be 130 mm/s, evaluated by considering a
tracer particle that passes the diagonal of a mean pixel in the observation area over a time
interval. A tracer particle with its instantaneous velocity less than LV could be mistaken as
static because of a possibility for remaining in the same pixel on the two consecutive images.
In all, 36 sets of biases (9 runs × 4 tracer particles/run) are shown in Fig. 5, where the biases
due to the effect of spatial resolution can be positive or negative. The biases range from–0.8
to 1.3 for the smallest values of LO VV / . The range of the biases reduces with the increase of
LO VV / and approaches minimal as LO VV / exceeds unity.
FIG. 5. The biases induced by the effect of spatial resolution, defined as OOAA VVVV //  ,
varying with nondimensionalized mean particle velocity LO VV / . A total of 36 data
sets are shown, the mean value of each data set is marked with an asterisk, and the
associated error bar represents the meanthree times of standard deviation.
The mean value of each set of biases is marked with an asterisk (Fig. 5), and the
associated error bar represents the range of meanthree times of standard deviation. The
mean biases are consistently close to zero, indicating that the total quantities of positive and
negative biases are balanced. Each error bar covers more than 95% of the data set, with the
remainder falling beyond the upper bound. The positive biases are greater in magnitude but
smaller in quantity (only 37% are positive), resulting in the near-zero values of mean bias.
To be useful, Fig. 5 is transformed to a relation between the standard deviation of biases
and nondimensionalized particle velocity (Fig. 6). This relation provides useful information.
Given the value of LO VV / , the possible biases in the velocity estimates can be immediately
evaluated. Given the tolerance of biases and a known value of OV , the threshold velocity LV
can be determined and used as the criterion for selecting a proper range of acoustic imaging.
We present herein a first attempt to explore the potential of applying an acoustic camera
in PTV, aiming to call for further research on this challenging subject.
