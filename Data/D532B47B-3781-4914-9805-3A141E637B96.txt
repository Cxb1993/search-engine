electrons and holes are allowed to tunnel into the quantum
dot, while optical emission occurs. We also calculate the con-
sequent optical emission due to the bipolar tunneling and we
find that dramatic changes in the emission spectra occur as
the applied bias is varied.
II. ELECTRON TUNNELING CURRENT

the system of a metal/quantum dot nanostructure/metal

nothing but the Landauer formula,27 which is valid even
though on-site Coulomb interactions are taken into account.
The detailed derivation of Eq. 2 is similar to that of Ref.
28. For simplicity, these tunneling rates will be assumed to
be energy and bias independent. Note that the tunneling rates
can be calculated numerically.29 Therefore, the calculation of
tunneling current is entirely determined by the spectral func-
tion of A=Im G,

retarded Green‚Äôs function G,

through the Anderson model.30,31 In Ref. 30, the differential
conductance of electron transport through quantum dot with

vestigated based on the linear-response theory. Their treat-
ment corresponds to Beenakker‚Äôs approach, which calculates
the distribution function of N electrons in a quantum dot
using the detailed balance equations.32 Here, we derive the
spectral function for a QD tunnel junction with arbitrary
number of energy levels by solving the equations of motion
directly.

the self-termination of the hierarchy of equations of motion,

to a different configuration with more particles. By keeping
the two-particle correlation functions associate with the same
level, we can obtain neat closed form expressions for all
Green‚Äôs functions involved. The detailed derivations which

chemical potentials of both the left electrode and right elec-
trodes are assumed to be 0.78 eV below the ground state
energy level E1 at zero bias. Meanwhile, we choose E2‚àíE1
=0.236 eV, E3‚àíE1=0.456 eV, U1=0.137 eV, U1,2=U2,1
=0.122 eV, U2=0.07 eV, U3=0.06 eV, U1,3=U3,1
=0.1 eV, and U2,3=U3,2=0.04 eV. These physical param-
eters were determined by considering their possible physical
range and the best agreement between the calculated and
measured tunneling spectra. We note that the p-like level is
sixfold degenerate including spin due the symmetry of the
spherical QD. The coupling strength between the left elec-
trode or the right electrode and the px- or py-like orbital is
weak. Therefore, only pz-like orbital has been included,
which is labeled by E2, while E3 denotes one of the d-like
orbitals that is strongly coupled to the leads.
Occupation numbers N and c are obtained by solving
the coupled equations Eqs. 7 and 8. Once they are de-
termined, we can calculate the tunneling current by substi-
tuting Eq. 6 into Eq. 2. Figure 2 shows the tunneling
current as a function of the applied bias at zero temperature
and zero gate voltage. For simplicity, we have adopted the
following energy and bias independent tunneling rates, L
=R=1 meV. The tunneling current exhibits a staircaselike
plateaus, arising from the well-known Coulomb blockade ef-
fect including both intralevel and interlevel interactions.
The length of each plateau indicates the energy level separa-
tion of adjacent resonant channels. The height of each step in
the staircase indicates the probability strength of the resonant
channel, which is determined by the one-electron and two-
electron occupation numbers. To further analyze and resolve
the current spectra, the differential conductance defined as
dJ /dVa is also plotted near the bottom in Fig. 2. The first
eight peaks arising from the resonant channels are 1=E1,
2=E1+U1, 3=E2, 4=E1+U1+U12, 5=E2+U2, 6=E2
+U12, 7=E1+U1+2U12, and 8=E2+U2+U12. These differ-
ential conductance peaks have a Lorentzian shape of width
L+R /2, which reveals the broadening of resonant chan-
nels. However, it is difficult to directly determine these im-
portant physical parameters by experiment because of the
inhomogeneous broadening caused by other factors.
To examine the whole functionality of the SET, the tun-
neling current as a function of the gate voltage for various
tunneling-rate ratios and at Va=10 mV is plotted in Fig. 3.
The tunneling current exhibits an oscillatory behavior, which
is different from the staircase behavior shown in Fig. 2.
Curves a‚Äìe correspond, respectively, L=0.2 meV, L
=0.4 meV, L=1 meV, L=5 meV, and L=10 meV. R
is fixed at 1 meV. In shell-tunneling condition L /R1, the
strengths of peaks arising from the E1+U1, E2+2U12+U2,
and E3+2U13+2U23+U3 are weaker than those of peaks aris-
ing from E1, E2+2U12, and E3+2U13+2U23. On the other
hand, such a trend is oppositive in the shell-filling case, i.e.,
L /R1. Many small satellite peaks are present. These
peaks result from the fact that one-particle and two-particle
occupation numbers have not yet reached one for the applied
bias. For example, increasing L going from a to e, the
strengths of resonant channels E2, E1+U1+U12, and E2
+U12 are enhanced. It is worth noting that resonant channels
resulting from the intralevel Coulomb interactions do not
disappear even though L /R1. This is attributed to carri-
ers blockaded by electrons in the right electrode, when the
energy level of the quantum dot is tuned into continuum
states below the Fermi energy of the right electrode. Note
that the assumption of energy-independent tunneling rates is
not very realistic since different orbitals have different cou-
pling strengths to the band states of electrodes. In fact, one
can measure the tunneling current spectra as functions of the
gate voltage at small bias Va and zero temperature to de-
termine the different tunneling rates associated with different
levels and reveal the orbital characteristics of CdSe QD if the
widths of the peaks are larger than the inhomogeneous
broadening caused by other factors.
Figure 4 shows a direct comparison of the calculated tun-
neling current spectrum with the measured one reported in
Ref. 21, where the observed differential conductance peaks
are broadened. To take into account the inhomogeneous
broadening caused by either the Coulomb interactions from
neighbor QDs or other factors, we replace each Lorentzian
function appearing in the differential conductance by a
Gaussian function of the form f i exp	‚àí ‚àíi

when the bias further increases.
IV. BIPOLAR TUNNELING
So for, we have only discussed current generated by the
electrons tunneling through resonant channels. Simultaneous
electron and hole transport can occur and it has been ob-
served in the negative bias regime.21,22 In the system consid-
ered, the Fermi level EF is much closer to the lowest con-
duction state than to the highest valence state see Fig. 1a.
Therefore, a small forward bias can lead to the electron tun-
neling, while the holes remain blocked see Fig. 1b. On
the other hand, a large reverse bias must be applied before
the hole can tunnel into the quantum dot, which would also
accompany the electron tunneling see Fig. 1c. Our formu-
las Eqs. 4‚Äì8 presented in Sec. II remain valid for such a
situation, provided that the signs of particle energies and
interlevel Coulomb energies are properly taken care of. For
the holes, the energy levels are denoted by Eh,, which are
defined as the difference in energy of the lowest-lying con-
duction state and the corresponding valence state of concern.
For the interlevel Coulomb energies, U,j will be negative for
two levels occupied by one electron and one hole and posi-
tive otherwise. Furthermore, the bipolar tunneling is accom-
panied by a radiative recombination. For the system consid-
ered in Ref. 21 under reverse bias, two-electron levels and
two hole levels need to be involved. This correspond to a
four-level system M =4. For a hole tunneling through level
Eh, while the other hole level j and electron levels 1 and 2
can be occupied by 0, 1, or 2 particles, the retarded Green‚Äôs
function is given by

for electrons and holes, respectively. Teh
=eh,,Leh,,R / eh,,L+eh,,R. Note that we intro-
duced the so-called hole electrodes in Eq. 12, which is
empty states of electron electrodes. Let us consider the case
where the energy gap of the quantum dot is Eh+Ee
=2.28 eV.21 Under the picture of hole electrodes, the ground
state of holes will be 1.5 eV above the Fermi energy of hole
electrodes. When the applied bias of left electron electrode is
in the regime of negative bias, such a bias appears positive
for holes in the left electrode. Because Reh is typically less
than 0.01 meV for semiconductor QDs which is much
smaller than the tunneling rates considered here, we can
safely ignore the effect of radiative recombination on the
average occupancy in the analysis here.
To describe the tunneling spectra observed in Refs. 21 and
22, some physical parameters relevant with holes and
electron-hole Coulomb interactions should be determined.
First, we adopt the energy level separation for holes as
Eh,2‚àíEh,1=80 meV, which is much smaller than that
between the ground state and the first excited state of elec-
trons. The intralevel and interlevel hole Coulomb interac-
tions are Uhh,11=160 meV, Uhh,22=140 meV, and Uhh,12
=Uhh,21=150 meV. Due to the more localized wave function
for holes as a result of heavier effective mass for the valence
band, it is expected that hole-hole Coulomb interactions
are stronger than those for electrons. Meanwhile
Ueh,11=‚àí130 meV, Ueh,12=‚àí120 meV, Ueh,21=‚àí108 meV,
and Ueh,22=‚àí85 meV. The tunneling rates for electron and
hole energy levels are given by e,1,L=0.5 meV, e,1,R
=0.1 meV, e,2,L=3.0 meV, e,2,R=0.6 meV, h,1,L
=1.0 meV, h,1,R=0.6 meV, h,2,L=1.0 meV, and h,2,R
=0.6 meV. Figure 6 shows the calculated differential con-
ductance as a function of the negative bias. Again, we take
into account the inhomogeneous broadening effect by replac-
ing each Lorentzian function appearing in the differential
conductance by a Gaussian broadening function with width
=35 meV. For comparison, the experimental results taken
from Ref. 21 are shown on the top of the figure. Our results
for negative bias below ‚àí2.5 V agree well with the experi-
ment. Because the experimental system is not stable in the
strong negative bias regime, Jdira21,22 did not show the tun-
neling spectra beyond ‚àí2.5 V. The complete spectra in the
high bias regime beyond ‚àí2.5 V should involve more than
four levels.

V. SUMMARY
A multiple-level Anderson model which takes into ac-
count the intralevel and interlevel Coulomb interactions is
used to calculate the tunneling current spectra of quantum
dot tunnel junctions. The tunneling current through the
ground state and excited states of individual quantum dots
are calculated in the framework of Green‚Äôs function method.
A closed form expression of the spectral function is derived
and it provides a simple and efficient way to model the com-
plicated tunneling current behavior of a quantum dot junc-
tion.
The tunneling current characteristics as functions of the
applied bias Va and gate voltage Vg are investigated. It is
found that due to the Coulomb blockade effect, the
tunneling-rate ratio can significantly influences the tunneling
current spectra of the quantum dot junction. This indicates
that the implementation of quantum dot junction should have
precise control over the position, shape, and size of quantum
dots in order to achieve the desired IV characteristics. We
also point out that the negative differential conductance can
be produced due to the interdot Coulomb interactions for a
tunnel junction involving multiple QDs sandwiched between
the metallic electrodes. Using a four-level model two level
for electrons and two level for holes, we can identify the
origin of various peaks observed in the bipolar tunneling
current spectra, as reported in Refs. 21 and 22. Finally, we
show that the bipolar tunneling process can lead to a single-
photon emission spectrum, which can be changed dramati-
cally via the change in the applied bias.

APPENDIX A: QUANTUM DOT JUNCTION INVOLVING
TWO LEVELS
In this appendix, we derive the retarded Green‚Äôs function
for the case with two levels. The derivations presented here
will make the rigorous proof for the general case as pre-
sented in Appendix B much easier to follow. We consider a

Here, we have not included the effect of particle correlation

In this paper, we only focus on the Coulomb blockade re-

To solve Eq. A1, we need to calculate the equation of

where the ‚Äúdouble prime‚Äù on the summation indicates that j
is not among the n states and not in the level . In the
n-particle state labeled by j1 , . . . , jn, if there are m levels
occupied with two particles and the rest singly occupied, we
can label them by j1 , j1 , . . . , jm , jm , j2m+1 , . . . , jn. We then as-
sume that the n-particle correlation function can be factor-
ized as follows
nj1¬Ø njn = cj1¬Ø cjmN2m+1¬Ø Nn,
where cji = njinji denotes the two-particle correlation func-
tion in level ji and Nj = nj denotes the average occupancy in
state j. Note that if we made the further approximation cji
=NjiNji, it would then correspond to the Hartree‚ÄìFock ap-
proximation, typically adopted in the literature for studying
the charge transport of an SET. Here, we shall go beyond the
Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation by keeping the two-particle
correlation functions when the two particles occupy the same
level. They are evaluated by solving Eq. 8 self-consistently.
The 2M-particle Green‚Äôs function can be immediately
solved since the hierarchy of equations of motion terminates
there. We obtain

Based on the above derivations, we can now prove the following two theorems.
Theorem 1. The 2+n-particle Green‚Äôs functions for m singly occupied levels and n‚àím empty levels with any choice

coefficients and the pole occurring at the corresponding energy k, which is determined by counting the occupancies of levels

Theorem 2. The 1+n-particle Green‚Äôs functions for m+1 singly occupied levels including the level  and n‚àím empty

The above two theorems can be proved via induction. We already shown from Eqs. B6‚ÄìB14 that Theorem 1 is valid for the
cases 2+n2M ‚àí3 and Theorem 2 is valid for the cases 1+n2M ‚àí3. Assuming that case n is valid if we can show that Case
n‚àí1 is also valid, then the above two theorems are proved. Let us consider a 2+n‚àí1-particle Green‚Äôs function, which is
obtained by removing one particle from the 2+n-particle Green‚Äôs function as described in Theorem 1. Assume that the
particle is removed from the level jr, which can be any level other than jm+1 , . . . , jn or . There are two possible situations: ajr does not coincide with one of the levels in j1 , . . . , jm and b jr coincides with one of the levels in j1 , . . . , jm. We first consider

since the c operators are just plain numbers, and they have
no effect on the denominator of the term. For the analysis
below, we are not concerned with the numerator of the term.
Thus, the presence of an aÀÜj operator will be treated as the
product of two bÀÜ operators, bÀÜ j+bÀÜ j‚àí the + and ‚àí indicate the
two spin states. When a bÀÜ ja operator appears in a given
product of Eq. B18, the permutation Pj,jrr with
j= ja must be excluded since we cannot replace bÀÜ ja by bÀÜ jr
and produce a match. Thus, for the 2+n‚àí1+n-particle
configuration in Eq. B17, there are nr‚àín bÀÜ operators,
bÀÜ j1 , . . . ,b
ÀÜ jnr‚àín
appear in the product, and we must exclude the
permutations with j= j1 , . . . , jÀÜnr‚àín and left with n different
permutations.
Therefore, we have shown that

Namely, every term labeled k in Eq. B18 is matched from
the sum of n terms n depends on k in Eq. B17 except
the leading term k=1. Furthermore, the prefactor for this
term i=1
n UÀÜ ,ji must be equal to the difference in energy de-
nominator between the term and the leading propagator. This
is obvious since the leading term is produced by the product
bÀÜ j1 , . . . ,b
ÀÜ jnr
and the term of concern is produced by the prod-
uct bÀÜ j1 , . . . ,b
ÀÜ jnr‚àín

configuration with m singly occupied levels and n‚àím empty levels, the same equation holds for a 2+n‚àí1-particle
configuration with m+1 singly occupied levels and n‚àím empty levels.
Next, we consider the situation b when we remove one particle from the level jr, where jr coincides with one of the levels
in j1¬Ø jm. Without losing generality, we let jr= jm. Namely, we want to prove that

is valid, provided that Theorem 1 is valid. However, since Theorem 1 is valid for any choice of configuration subject to the
constraints. We can write a equation similar to Eq. B15 for the following 2+n-particle Green‚Äôs function:

which is for the configuration with m‚àí2 singly occupied levels and n+1‚àím empty levels. Since Eq. B22 also describes
the situation where one particle is removed from level jm‚àí1 which does not coincide with one of the levels j1 , . . . , jm‚àí2 from

The situation b i.e., when jr coincides with one of the levels in j1¬Ø jm can be similarly proved by adopting the same
argument as in proving Theorem 1. Therefore, Theorem 2 is also proved. Using Theorems 1 and 2 and take the limit n=0

tively. The expression of Eq. 2 is the well known Landauer
formula, which is valid even though on-site Coulomb inter-
actions are taken into account.9 In principle, the energy and
bias-dependent tunneling rates can be calculated via numeri-
cal method.10 However, for simplicity, these tunneling rates
will be assumed to be energy and bias independent in the
present study. Therefore, the calculation of tunneling current
is entirely determined by the spectral function, A

where n denotes the number of one-particle energy levels
considered for the QD. m denotes the sum of the Coulomb
interactions seen by a particle in level  due to other particles
in configuration m, in which each level jj can be occu-
pied by zero, one, or two particles. pm denotes the probability
of finding the system in configuration m. For a two-level

Meanwhile, 1=0, 2=U,j, and 3=2U,j. For a three-
level system  j j, there are nine 33 configurations
and the probability factors become p1=ajaj, p2=bjaj, p3
=ajbj, p4=cjaj, p5=cjaj, p6=bjbj, p7=cjbj, p8=cjbj, and
p9=cjcj. Interlevel Coulomb interaction factors are 1=0,
2=U,j, 3=U,j, 4=2U,j, 5=2U,j, 6=U,j +U,j,
7=2U,j +U,j, 8=2U,j+U,j, and 9=2U,j +2U,j.
Based on these simple rules, the probability factors and in-
terlevel Coulomb interaction factors for any number of en-
ergy levels can be similarly determined. The sum of prob-
ability factors pm for all configurations is equal to 1,
reflecting the fact that G,
r  satisfies the sum rule. For two
particles occupying different levels, adopt the approximation,
n,nj,N,Nj,, while for two particles occupying the
same level, we keep the correlated form nj,nj,‚àí and call it
the average two-particle occupation number. We see that the
probability of finding the system in each configuration is
determined not only by the average one-particle occupation
numbers but also by the average two-particle occupation
numbers. According to the expression of retarded Green‚Äôs
function of Eq. 5, we need to determine the occupation
numbers N,N,‚àí and N,=c, which can be calculated

equations self-consistently:

the bias-dependent barrier height. For simplicity, we assume
i=+i, where =35 meV characterizes the broadening
due to coupling to nearby QDs. Both the positions and the
relative strengths of these peaks are in very good agreement
with the experimental measurement reported in Ref. 5. If we
remove the extrinsic broadening by setting =0, the differ-
ential conductance spectrum exhibits more resonance chan-
nels as shown in the lower part of the figure, which cannot be
experimentally resolved.
Now, we consider the single-photon emission spectra via
the interband transition in a reverse bias setup, as illustrated
in Fig. 1b. Simultaneous electrons and holes transport can
be observed for the STM-tip/QD tunnel junction considered
in Refs. 5 and 6 under negative bias. The QD gap considered
here is Eh+Ee=2.28 eV, where Eh and Ee denote, the ground
states of electrons and holes in the QD, respectively. For the
sake of simplicity, only a two-level model is considered in
the following study. We plot the electron and hole occupation
numbers Ne and Nh at negative bias in Fig. 4, where elec-
tron hole tunneling rates are taken to be L,e=R,e
=1 meV, L,h=R,h=1 meV. We choose the hole-hole
Coulomb interaction to be Uh=0.16 eV and the electron-hole
Coulomb interaction to be Ueh=0.145 eV. The differential
conductance is plotted in the lower part of Fig. 4. Many
resonant channels, including Ee‚àíUeh, Ee‚àí2Ueh, Ee+Ue
‚àíUeh, and Ee+Ue‚àí2Ueh are prohibited for bias in the range
between 0 and ‚àí1.95 V due to the fact that Nh=0 and Nhh
=0 hole-hole correlation function or the two-hole average
occupancy in the hole ground state. The first tunneling reso-
nance corresponds to the electron tunneling through the Ee
level in reverse bias, electrons can be injected from the sub-
strate. Once the electrons are injected into the QD, the reso-
nance channel at Eh‚àíUeh and subsequent channel at Eh
+Uh‚àí2Ueh become opened. It should be noted that holes are
injected from the tip. That is why the separation between the
Eh+Uh and Eh peaks is smaller than the separation between
the Ee+Ue and Ee peaks, although UeUh.
In bipolar carrier transport process, the single-photon
spectrum generated by the electron-hole recombination in
exciton complexes can be tuned by the applied bias. Al-
though the electrically driven single-photon source is impor-

teresting bias-dependent emission spectra of exciton

part of P gives the emission spectra, which is shown in
Fig. 5. Emission peaks due to the exciton, negative trion,
positive trion, and biexciton are labeled by X0, X‚àí, X+ and X2,
respectively. Here, we assume UhUehUe since the hole
tends to be more localized than the electron due to its heavier
effective mass. Therefore, the biexciton emission peak tran-
sition from the biexciton to the exiton exhibits a blue shift
from the exiton peak. The probability of each emission peak
is determined by the occupation numbers with staircase be-
havior, arising from Coulomb blockade effect. Thus, we see
dramatic changes in intensity for various peaks as the applied
bias is varied in the STM-tip/QD setup. Such dramatic
change was not observed in the p-n junction setup, as re-
ported in Ref. 2.
