Abstract
The thermosyphon cooling system in this study consists of a flat evaporator, a condenser, rising and falling
tubes with water as working fluid. The working fluid has different water levels inside the two components. This is
due to the vapor pressure deficits of the evaporation section and condenser section. This study utilizes condensing
and boiling pressure-difference theory and measures the temperature of the condenser wall to develop a theoretic
model for the water level deficit inside the thermal module of the two-phase closed-loop thermosyphon. The results
indicate that the working fluid infiltrates the condenser and indirectly verifies the phenomenon leading to the
different water levels inside the system. Moreover, the water level height difference theory presented in this study
may reduce the length of the condenser by 3.14cm.

6enabling the internal working fluid to quickly reach boiling the point and lowering the saturation temperature can
also reduce the temperature of the cooling surface. McGillis et al. [18,19] proposed a fairly complete report of a
low-pressure water boiling and strengthening mechanism.
This study explores the operating thermal performance of the liquid/gas two-phase change heat transfer
components of a closed-loop thermosyphon thermal module. This module offers the same vapor and liquid flow
direction without the limitations of traditional heat pipes. Dissipation of the heat capacity of the heat source is
conducted by forced convection to the atmosphere around the condenser section. This is because the vapor pressure
in the evaporator section through the connecting pipe to condensation caused by the pressure drop. Therefore, the
two-phase closed-loop thermosyphon thermal module has a water level difference within the evaporator and
condenser. Furthermore, the different cooling fin groups in the thermal module and the condensing capacity of the
evaporator section and condenser section are in contact with the working fluid of the different cross-sectional areas.
Therefore, the water level is significantly different on the left and right sides of the evaporation section and the
condensation section of the internal working fluid of the two-phase closed-loop thermosyphon thermal module.
Therefore, it is important to note the vapor pressure difference caused by the water level in the design of this type of
thermal module.
2. Methodology
2.1 Analytic Model
This study explored the relationship between the vapor pressure and water level inside a two-phase closed-loop
thermosyphon thermal module to acquire a theoretical model of the water level height difference of the thermal
module through the analysis of basic condensing and boiling theory. Figure 1 shows the internal vapor pressure and
water level through the heat source with the heating power Q, based on the entire experimental system. The entire
physical system can be divided into four control volumes to resolve the vapor pressure and the friction loss of steam
from the first control volume (C.V.1) to the third control volume (C.V.3), as revealed by formula (1). Furthermore,
the liquid static pressure balance of the fourth control volume (C.V.4) is exhibited by formula (2). The range of C.V.1
is from the vapor chamber, including the area from the connecting pipe to the entrance of the condenser region,
which encompasses the loss of steam pressure through the connecting pipe of the insulation materials. The range of
C.V.2 is from the entrance to the outlet of the condenser, which involves a loss of steam pressure after the condenser.
The scope of C.V.3 is from the outlet of the condenser to the connection surface of the vapor chamber, which entails
a loss of steam pressure through the connecting pipe. The scope of C.V.4 is from the connection surface of the vapor
chamber to the same high level in the connecting pipe of the vapor chamber.

and screws and nuts are used to the close integration. The vapor space inside the chamber is 2.88×10-3m3 (8060
6 mm3). The upper cover is mainly used to connect the up-flow pipe of the steam to the condenser, and the lower
cover is used to connect the down stream pipe section so that the working fluid reflows back to the vapor chamber
after condensation for re-evaporation. The lower cover is made into the form of sintered surface boiling to increase
the thermal performance of thermal module.
All pipes linking the vapor chamber and condenser are coated with insulating foam to reduce heat loss during
vapor transference. Pipe joints are all made of copper materials in order to prevent the leakage caused by the
different thermal expansion coefficients of the various materials between the connecting tubes. The outside diameter
and the wall thickness of the connecting oxygen-free pipe are 6.35 mm and 0.7112 mm, respectively. The connecting
pipe is connected at one end and a vacuum pump is used to achieve the required vacuum degree (10-3torr); the other
end is connected with the filling system to provide the working fluid required by the system. Both ends are fitted
with check valves; the working fluid is replaced to facilitate the filling ratio. The condenser is a vertical type
constructed with a condensing tube through a set of three quarters of rectangular fins, with a length of 60mm, width
of 40mm, thickness of 0.3mm and pitch of 1.2mm. The total number is 95 and the total length is 14.28cm. Because
this study investigates the height difference phenomenon of the water level inside the two-phase closed-loop
thermosyphon thermal module, thermocouples were set up particularly at entrances and exits of the condenser to
measure the temperatures, Tc1 and Tc7, of the working fluid at the condenser. In addition, there were divided into five
sections outside the wall of the condenser and five thermocouples are employed to measure the wall temperatures,
Tc2, Tc3, Tc4, Tc5, and Tc6, at five points. These seven measuring temperature points are shown in Figure 5, relative to
the location points of Tc1 (18cm), Tc2 (15.14cm), Tc3 (12.14cm), Tc4 (9.14cm), Tc5 (6.14cm), Tc6 (3.14 cm) and Tc7
(1cm). The temperature c
T
of the condenser section is the average temperature of Tc2, Tc3, Tc4, Tc5 and Tc6. At a
distance of about 5 cm from the cooling fin, a T-type thermocouple is displayed to measure temperature a
T
of the
ambient. In this study, the transparent acrylic is composed of an air duct with outside dimensions of 250 x 270 x
400mm3 and internal dimensions of 40 x 162 x 400mm3. An axial fan with four 40 x 40 x 25mm3 fans has a
maximum speed of 15,000RPM. The fans pump out at one end of the wind duct and the condenser is placed in the
internal duct. To make the air passing through the condenser cooling fin uniform and to prevent bypass flow, the gaps
between the condenser and the air duct are filled up. All airflow passes through the fins of the condenser. All
measuring temperatures are connected to a data acquisition device to record temperature changes, and the data
recorder and personal computers are connected to facilitate the experimental order.
The experimental steps are as follows. First, clean the impurities on the surface of all the components of the
copper material with alcohol and then remove the covers of the vapor chamber for machining of the residual oil with
oxalic acid. Then, adjust the electronic instruments and thermocouples. Second, combine the upper cover and lower
cover containing the sintered structure to finish the vapor chamber, which links with the condenser, pipes and joints
to complete a two-phase closed-loop thermosyphon thermal module. To ensure the vacuum degree of the entire
system, the use of an air compressor and vacuum pump detects high pressure leakage to determine the leak-proof
ability of the system. The working fluids within the system are all forcefully driven out of the system by using a
dummy heater, air compressor and vacuum pump. The internal vacuum pressure has a middle vacuum degree (1~3
kPa) because of the vacuum pump within the air extraction system. Thermal grease is coated on the surface of the
heat source. Turn on the fan with a speed up to 15,000 RPM, and arrange the heat source and the vapor chamber to
fix the interface thermal resistance. A precise electronic scale filling volume of 9c.c. (20%) is required to inject the
12
water level of the vapor chamber lower. Thus, the temperatures of the heat source and based plate must be higher
with the low filling ratio. At various heating powers, the inlet temperatures, Tc1 and Tc2, of the condenser increase
and there are no obvious changes with the filling rate from 26.4% to 45.6%. This means that the working fluid can be
absorbed to the top position of the heat source by the capillary force at filling ratios of 26.4% or more. Therefore, the
temperatures, Tc1 and Tc2, and working fluid filling ratio did not have a significant relationship. The outlet
temperatures, Tc5 and Tc6, of the condenser maintain the level and are close to the atmospheric temperature from
these figures. Thus, the size of condenser can be reduced from 14.28cm to 10.14cm, which can reduce the material
and production costs of the condenser.
Figure 8 shows the theoretical curve of the water level height difference for the entire closed thermal module
system. When the dummy heater transmits heat capacity to the vapor chamber, the internal liquid working fluid
quickly changes to a steam state by heat transfer mechanisms of evaporation or boiling. A lot of steam flows to the
condenser through the insulation of the connecting pipes and dissipates heat capacity to condense to a liquid working
fluid in the condenser, causing the entire system to be in a low-pressure state. The water level inside the vapor
chamber should be below that of the lower flow tube section for the system operation to be stable. This is because the
temperature differences lead to vapor pressure deficits between the vapor chamber and the condenser and flow
resistance caused by liquid and vapor circulation in the pipes. The curves can be obtained from the experimental and
theoretical relationships of the cross-sectional area of the vapor chamber and the condensation tube, as shown in the
figure. Moreover, the solid black line in the figure is the theoretical water level height difference of formula (17)
based on the heat transfer theory of pool nucleate boiling and film condensation in this study. Comparing the two
curves, equation (17) can accurately predict the same level with the height difference between the experimental curve
before the heating power is less than 60W; however, beyond 60W, the water level height difference obtained in the
experimental curve has tended to be horizontal, while the theoretical curve will increases with the heating power, the
water level height difference increases only slightly.
4. Conclusions
This study discusses the thermal performance of the two-phase closed-loop thermosyphon thermal module, and
indirectly confirms that the working fluid reflows into the condenser by measuring the wall temperatures of the
condenser, which results in the water level difference phenomenon within the system. For the two-phase closed-loop
thermosyphon cooling system, the micro-scale water level difference phenomenon resulting from the condensing and
boiling vapor pressure difference between the evaporator and condenser sections based on the theories of pool
nucleate boiling and film condensation and the validation of experimental method to measure the wall temperature of
condenser. The height of the condenser of the two-phase closed-loop thermosyphon system can be shortened by
3.14cm by using the theoretical water level difference model. The working fluid within the two-phase closed-loop
thermosyphon system has different heights resulting from the vapor pressure difference between the evaporator and
the condenser sections. This should be noted in the design of such two-phase heat transfer components. Finally, this
study has established a theoretical height difference model for two-phase closed-loop cooling modules. This can
serve as a reference for future researchers.
