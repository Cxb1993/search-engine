The above field expansions suitable for 
oblique incidence are different from those 
for normal incidence studied in [5] in two 
respects.  First, Rη  is different from  Lη   
as long as rχ ≠  0. Second, the expressions 
of  and  given here are more 
complicated than those reported in [5]. Let

present approach for both the co- and 
cross-polarized echo widths (the 
cross-polarized data are not shown here for 
brevity) and for all possible observation 
angles, we may have to divide each of the 
two bi-isotropic layers in the approach of [3] 
into 20000 partitions, or even more. This 
phenomenon suggests that, if the bi-isotropic 
layers are thick, the present approach is 
much more efficient than the one used in [3]. 
Also shown in the figure are the results for  
2 3 0.15,r rχ χ= =  which may obviously 
deviate from those for 2 3 0r rχ χ= =  for 
some observation angles. For the case of 
in 45θ = ° , the echo widths  appear to vary 
with the observation angle more rapidly than 
those for the case of in 90θ = ° . In the above 
examples, our computed results for the case 
of in 90θ = °  have been checked against those 
reported in [3] and [5]. To the authors’ 
knowledge, the results for in 90θ ≠ °  are not 
yet available in the literature. In fact, our 
in 90θ ≠ °  results have been validated by data 
computed using an FD approach that is 
extended and modified from [3] for dealing 
with the oblique-incidence case. 
Figure 4 shows the echo widths for the 
TM case for a single-layer Tellegen medium, 
a nonreciprocal bi-isotropic material [3], [7], 
backed by a four-layer GFRPC having a 
fiber orientation pattern of . 
The equal value of 
[0 / 90 / 0 / 90 ]° ° ° °
5rχ  and 5rη  is used as a 
parameter for the Tellegen medium, where 
5 5 /r r 5rη µ ε=  is the relative intrinsic 
impedance of the Tellegen layer. For 
PEC-backed Tellegen slabs, it has been 
proved that as long as a twist-polarizer 
condition (i.e., r rη χ≤ ) is satisfied,  the 
co-polarized backscattering is identically 
zero at certain frequencies [6]. It has also 
been numerically verified in [3] that for 
GFRPC-backed Tellegen cylinders with 
r rη χ= , there exist certain quasi-invisible 
frequency bands in which the co-polarized 
backscattering becomes very low (i.e., there 
are dips in the curves of the backscattered 
co-polarized echo widths as a function of 
frequency); however, the lowest values in 
the dips never become identically zero. In 
this figure, we can see the dips in the 
co-polarized echo-width curves for all the 
three sets of  5rχ  and 5rη . These dips exit 
for both the normally and obliquely incident 
cases. Among the three incident angles ( 30 , 
, and 90 ), the dips for the smallest 
incident angle (i.e., ) are found to be the 
shallowest. The cross-polarized 
high-scattering bands always correspond to 
the co-polarized low-scattering bands (or 
quasi-invisible bands). In contrast to the 
co-polarized echo-width curves, the 
cross-polarized echo-width curves are only 
slightly affected by the change in 
°
60° °
30°
inθ . 
 
IV CONCLUSIONS 
 
A rigorous theoretical model based on a 
recursive eigenfuction theory and a 
state-equation approach has been developed 
to compute the echo widths of a 
multilayered bi-isotropic cylindrical shell 
with an interior GFRPC backing. The 
computer code so implemented is efficient 
and flexible. The normal and oblique 
scattering properties for some sample 
configurations have been studied in detail 
and the associated numerical results have 
agreed very well with data, if available, in 
the literature.
