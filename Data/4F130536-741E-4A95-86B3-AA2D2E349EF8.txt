本計畫在於探討金屬鹽類對於卵磷脂反式微胞的影響。卵磷脂是一種生物雙親性分子，具有
親水基與疏水基，可在有機溶劑中形成球狀反式微胞。金屬鹽類因不溶於非極性有機溶劑中，故其
在有機溶劑中的角色極少被討論。在本研究中，我們卻發現金屬鹽類可在卵磷脂存在下溶於有機溶
劑中，而且二價（鈣離子）與三價（鑭離子）金屬離子可讓卵磷脂球狀反式微胞轉變為蟲狀反式微
胞，蟲狀反式微胞會相互糾纏，增加溶劑黏度，進而形成有機凝膠。相形之下，一價離子（鈉離
子）就無此現象。我們發現離子引發凝膠形成的能力與離子跟卵磷脂親水基的結合力強弱有關。本
研究所發現的現象除了具學術價值外，其所形成的低成本、無毒的新型軟質材料亦具有應用的可行
性。

It is known that lecithin, a zwitterionic phospholipid, self-assembles into spherical reverse micelles in 
organic solvents. We have explored the effects of adding inorganic salts to lecithin organosols. Salts are 
insoluble in organic solvents, and hence their effects on reverse self-assembly have rarely been studied. Our 
studies show, however, that salts can indeed be dissolved in organic liquids in the presence of lecithin. More 
interestingly, salts of multivalent cations like calcium (Ca
2+
) and lanthanum (La
3+
) greatly increase the 
viscosity of lecithin organosols and transform the samples into optically transparent organogels. In 
comparison, monovalent cations, such as Na
+
, have negligible effect on reverse self-assembly. We show that 
gelation is accompanied by a nanostructural transition from spherical micelles to cylindrical filaments. The 
varying abilities of different cations to induce gelation are shown to correlate with their binding tendencies to 
the phosphocholine headgroups of lecithin. A two-component gelator such as lecithin/Ca
2+
 could be attractive 
for applications due to its negligible cost and non-toxic nature.

Dynamic frequency spectra were conducted in the linear viscoelastic regime of the samples, as determined 
from dynamic strain sweep measurements. For steady-shear experiments, sufficient time was allowed before 
data collection at each shear rate to ensure that the viscosity reached its steady-state value.  
 
Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS).  SANS measurements were made on the NG-7 and NG-3 (30 m) 
beamlines at NIST in Gaithersburg, MD. Neutrons with a wavelength of 6 Å  were selected. Three sample-
detector distances were used to obtain data over a range of wave vectors from 0.004 to 0.4 Å
-1
. Samples were 
studied in 1 mm or 2 mm quartz cells at 25°C. Scattering spectra were corrected and placed on an absolute 
scale using NIST calibration standards. The data are shown as plots of the absolute intensity I versus the 
wave vector q = 4sin(/2)/, where  is the wavelength of incident neutrons and  is the scattering angle. 
Modeling of SANS data was conducted using software modules provided by NIST to be used with the IGOR 
graphing package.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
Phase Behavior and Rheology of the Gels. We first present results for mixtures of lecithin and anhydrous 
calcium chloride (CaCl2) in n-decane. Figure 1 shows the zero-shear viscosity 0 of solutions containing 40 
mM of lecithin and various Ca
2+
 concentrations. At a [Ca
2+
] of 5 mM or lower, the viscosity is close to that of 
the solvent. At slightly higher [Ca
2+
], the viscosity rapidly increases. Samples with about 12-15 mM of Ca
2+
 
are gel-like and their viscosities are about ten million times higher than that of the solvent. The photograph of 
such a sample is shown in the figure and one can see that the sample flows very slowly in the inverted vial, 
indicating gel-like behavior.
17
 Note also that this organogel is optically clear and colorless; also there is no 
indication of any solid precipitate – i.e., the salt is completely dissolved in the sample. The other interesting 
result from Figure 1 is that the viscosity shows a non-monotonic behavior – it peaks around 14 mM Ca2+ and 
then falls sharply. By about 40 mM Ca
2+
, the sample has reverted to a thin, clear liquid with a viscosity close 
to that of the solvent. Thereafter, around 43 mM Ca
2+
, the sample becomes turbid while staying 
homogeneous. The turbidity is indicative of large structures and/or phase separation. Samples in this regime 
were not studied further. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Next, we used rheological techniques to characterize the gel-like lecithin/Ca
2+
 samples at intermediate 
[Ca
2+
]. Figure 2 shows the dynamic rheological response (elastic G and viscous G moduli as functions of 
frequency ω) of a sample containing 40 mM lecithin and 14 mM Ca2+, which corresponds to the viscosity 
peak in Figure 1. Both moduli show a weak frequency dependence, with G dominating over G across the 
entire frequency range – thus, the sample response is mostly elastic. The gap between the moduli narrows at 
low frequencies, but the curves do not intersect – this indicates that the relaxation time of the sample is very

Microstructure of the Gels from SANS. Next, we describe the results of SANS experiments on 
lecithin/Ca
2+
 organogels. These were conducted using deuterated cyclohexane as the solvent and with the 
lecithin concentration fixed at 20 mM. I(q) plots are shown in Figure 4 for four different [Ca
2+
]. In Figure 5, 
we observe that the intensity at low q increases substantially as [Ca
2+
] is increased. For samples with no or 
very low (< 3 mM) Ca
2+
, the intensity tends to a plateau at low q. In contrast, the sample with 7.2 mM Ca
2+
 
shows a power-law behavior close to I ~ q
–1
 (slope of –1 on the log-log plot) at low q, which is the scaling 
relationship expected for rod-like structures.
9,20
 Finally, note the slight drop in intensity at the lowest q for the 
14.4 mM Ca
2+
 sample compared to the 7.2 mM one. The same data also shows more of a deviation from the I 
~ q
–1
 scaling at low q.    
 
 We have fitted form-factor models (described in the previous section) to the above SANS data, and 
the fits are shown in Figure 5 as solid lines through the data. Parameters from the modeling are shown in 
Table 1. For the 20 mM lecithin / no Ca
2+
 sample, the data admits to an oblate ellipsoid model with nearly 
identical major and minor axes (33.4 Å  and 21.5 Å  respectively), indicating that the micelles are close to 
spherical.
8
 For the other plots, a model for polydisperse cylinders is used. From the fit parameters, we note a 
small but distinct increase in the cylinder radius Rc with increasing [Ca
2+
]: from 25.8 Å  for 5.4 mM Ca
2+
 to 
28.9 Å  for 14.4 mM Ca
2+
. Also, the average cylinder length L0 sharply increases initially (from 131 Å  for 5.4 
mM Ca
2+
 to 777 Å  for 7.2 mM Ca
2+
) but then drops to 246 Å  for the 14.4 mM Ca
2+
 sample. In other words, 
the cylinder length seems to increase and then decrease with [Ca
2+
], which reflects the trend in the zero-shear 
viscosity as a function of [Ca
2+
] (Figure 1).

binding forces the lipid molecules together, which makes the lipid tails more densely packed and 
ordered.
14,21,22
 The tails are effectively forced into a more straightened configuration and in turn, the average 
cross-sectional area atail per lipid may decrease.
21,22
 Thus, cation binding may simultaneously affect both atail 
and ahg in ways that cause a decrease in p, and this is depicted in Figure 6.   
 
We should point out here that the cylindrical chains or filaments in lecithin/ion mixtures appear to be 
very different from the reverse wormlike micelles seen, for example, in lecithin/water
6,7
 or similar
8,9,23-25
 
systems. A characteristic property of wormlike micelles (both normal and reverse) is that they are “living” 
polymers: they rapidly break and re-form due to exchange of amphiphiles between neighboring chains.
6,26
 In 
the limit where the timescale for breaking br is much shorter than that for chain reptation rep, the micellar 
sample behaves as a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid with a single relaxation time.
6,26
 Lecithin/ion samples, on the 
other hand, are gel-like (elastic), not viscoelastic, and their rheology is quite different from that of a Maxwell 
fluid. The most likely explanation is that the cylindrical lecithin/ion chains have very different dynamics. The 
binding of cations like Ca
2+
 to phospholipids is expected to be quite strong and this will hinder the facile 
exchange of lipids between the chains.
27,28
 Therefore chain breaking and re-forming will be significantly 
retarded (i.e., br will be very large) – in effect, the chains will behave more like “dead” (static) rather than 
“living” (dynamic) polymers. The entanglement of these long, robust chains can then lead to a quasi-
permanent gel network. The chains could still relax by reptation, but if they are long enough such relaxation 
will be very slow (the reptation timerep ~ L
3
 where L is the contour length
9,26
). This could explain why a 
distinct relaxation time was not detected within the frequency window of our dynamic rheological 
experiments.   
 
We also noted an increase in the radius of the cylinders with increasing [Ca
2+
] from the SANS 
modeling. This was in contrast to the results for lecithin/bile salt mixtures where the micellar radius was 
independent of the bile salt concentration. The growing cylinder radius is likely due to the straightening of 
lipid tails mentioned above. Note that lecithin has two cis-unsaturations in one tail, which implies kinks in 
that tail. When cations bind to lecithin, the lipid molecules are brought closer and this is believed to make the 
tails straighter and more ordered.
14,21,22
 In the case of lipid bilayers in water, tail ordering has been shown to 
increase the bilayer thickness.
22
 The same effect can increase the effective thickness of cylindrical filaments 
in our lecithin/ion mixtures, and this is also shown schematically in Figure 6.    
      
Lastly, past studies on lipid-ion binding can also help to explain the maximum in viscosity vs. [Ca
2+
] 
seen in Figure 1. Both experiments and simulations have shown that the binding between Ca
2+
 and 
zwitterionic phospholipids is optimized at a molar ratio of approximately 2 lipids per Ca
2+
 ion.
11,14
 The 
viscosity maximum likely reflects this binding stoichiometry. As seen from Figure 1, the viscosity increases 
to a peak at a molar ratio of ~ 2.8 lipids per Ca
2+
 ion, which is close to the optimal binding ratio mentioned 
above. At this point, every Ca
2+
 ion is expected to be bound strongly to lipid headgroups, and this seems to 
correlate with the longest cylindrical filaments. Beyond this point, the presence of excess [Ca
2+
] seems to 
cause a decrease in the cylinder length (as inferred from SANS modeling, Table 1), which correlates with the 
decrease in viscosity. The precise reason for the cylinder shortening is not clear, but it is possible that the 
excess Ca
2+
 stabilizes the end-caps of cylindrical filaments (more end-caps means shorter filaments). 
Alternately, excess Ca
2+
, if still weakly bound to the lipid headgroups, may drive a transition from cylinders 
to reverse bilayers.  
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 
 
This study has demonstrated that simple inorganic salts can modulate the self-assembly of 
phospholipids like lecithin in organic solvents. Salt effects vary with the cation, and in particular, strong 
effects are found in the case of the divalent alkaline earth metals (Ca
2+
) and the trivalent lanthanides (La
3+
). 
These multivalent cations bind with the phosphocholine headgroups of lecithin and induce a transition from 
spherical reverse micelles to cylindrical fibrils. The fibrils have diameters ranging from ca. 4 to 6 nm while 
their lengths are expected to exceed several hundred nm. These fibrils behave like “dead”, rather than 
“living” polymers, i.e., they do not undergo frequent breaking and recombination events. The entanglement 
of these long, robust fibrils gives rise to a quasi-permanent gel network.
