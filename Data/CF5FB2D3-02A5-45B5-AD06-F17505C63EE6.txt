is considered low, they still have an excellent accuracy. In this paper, the features of keystrokes are 
keystroke duration and four keystroke latencies; all of which are based on time interval between 
keystrokes. Two kinds of error rates [18] used to analyze the system accuracy. The False Acceptance 
Rate (FAR) is the rate that the system accepts an imposter and the False Rejection Rate (FRR) is the 
rate that the system rejects a valid user. These are expressed as values in a [0, 1] interval or as 
percentage values.  
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the architecture of the methodology as well as the 
data collection and proposed method are described. In Section 3, the obtained results are presented. 
Finally, the conclusions are made in Section 4. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the

2. Methodology 
 
The framework of the main steps of the system is illustrated in Figure 1. In this study, we do not 
deal with typographical errors and “Caps Lock” key. 
 
 
Figure 1. The framework of the system 
 
In the enrollment phase, a user initializes an account and enters his or her password several times. 
The password which is typed by the user and monitored by the system is called target string. While he 
is typing, the keystroke data is captured and the features are calculated using the data. Finally, the 
samples are created and a template as well as other related information are computed and stored in a 
database. In this system, ten samples are collected as enrollment data for each user since the user is 
becoming impatient if providing more than ten samples [2]. 
In the authentication phase, an unknown user tries to access a computer system. Here, we assume 
the user knows the legitimate user ID and he also enters the correct password in the experiment. The 
system then uses this sample with the designed method to determine whether an unknown user is 
allowed to access the system. Haider et al. [14] discovered legitimate users usually fail in the first 
attempt of authentication but they succeeded when they are given a second try. In this scheme, if the 
user fails in the first attempt, he or she will be given a second attempt.

4. Conclusions 
 
Keystroke technology has been widely studied in computer security. This study examines the 
usefulness of the method proposed in this paper for KA systems. It is a way to utilize statistics 
to extract novel characteristic information in KA systems. This approach implied the concept of 
weight and automatically generated using the legitimate user’s enrollment samples. This system 
has a better results with the FAR of 4.8% and the FRR of 1.05% when th=54%. Further, in 
different values th for each account, the system obtained the FAR of 1.035% and the FRR of 0%. 
There are a reasonable amount of results showing the proposed method can be used to enhance 
the security of the password authentication systems.

than eighty times to achieve more consistency in the signing. It is also difficult to obtain the same accuracy 
as an actual signature. Recently, Ahmed and Traore used mouse movements to authenticate users and 
obtained a remarkable AFR of 0.0246315 [1]. In their scheme, the users install the data collection software 
on their machines and conduct their usual activities without any restriction. However, the data collected per 
user should be over a long period of time. 
According to the above discussions, an efficient and feasible system to collect users’ biometric data 
conveniently and precisely authenticate their identities is needed. In this paper we use a biometric -the 
personalized rhythm- as the second identifiable factor to authenticate users. We hypothesize each person 
clicks a mouse in a characteristic way, and then authenticate users by these click data. The data can be 
simply and conveniently captured by most devices, requires little time to collect, and quickly verify identities 
in the authentication. In the enrolment phase, ten samples are collected from each user since the user 
becomes impatient if providing more than ten samples [2]. Further, a statistical-fusion classifier [16] is used 
to examine the usefulness of the rhythm click-dynamics authentication system based on mouse clicks. 
This paper is organized as follows. The architecture of the methodology as well as the evaluation 
approach and the data collection are described in Section 2. The experimental results are analyzed in Section 
3. Finally, Section 4 is the conclusions. 
2. Methodology 
In the enrolment phase of our system, the user initializes an account and clicks the target rhythm several 
times. While the user is clicking, the click data is captured and then the system checks the number of clicks 
for the target rhythm. If the number is wrong, the user will be required to click again and the wrong data will 
be filtered out. Otherwise, the samples are created containing the features calculated using these click data. 
Finally, a template as well as other related information are computed and stored in a database. In the 
authentication phase, an unknown user tries to access our system and is required to enter the password and 
click the target rhythm. Here, we assume the user knows the password and he also clicks the correct target 
rhythm in the experiment. In other words, our system only uses the rhythm clicking characteristic with the 
designed classifier to determine whether an unknown user is allowed to access the system. Since legitimate 
users usually fail in the first attempt for authentication [2], our system gives user a second chance if he/she 
fails in the first attempt. 
For experimental convenience and to facilitate the accuracy of our method, our system used a fixed and 
common target rhythm -“Encourage with Love” in Taiwan or “Rainbow Claps” in Singapore. The beats of 
this rhythm are 2-3-4-2 with a total length of 11, as shown in Fig. 1. Such a fixed and common rhythm 
provides higher accuracy than unfamiliar rhythms. As Fig. 1 shows, the first musical note from the left is a 
quarter note; the third musical note from the left is an eighth note; and the sixth musical note from the left is 
an eighth rest. The system requires the unknown user to click the same target rhythm in the authentication 
phase. 
 
Fig. 1: The illustration of the target rhythm used in this paper 
 
Click dynamics studies the way a user interacts with a mouse or a stylus. In this paper, a common mouse 
is used as an input device. A mouse event includes the mouse button down and up, and five features are 
produced. These features are conceptually similar to the features of keystrokes and explained as follows: 
z Down-Up (DU) time: DU time is the interval between the same click being pressed and being 
released. 
z Down-Down (DD) time: DD time is the interval between the click being pressed and the next click 
being pressed. 
z Up-Down (UD) time: UD time is the interval between the click being released and the next click 
sample as legitimate. Table 2 lists the results of the top five AFR that are irrelevant to whether FAR and FRR 
are closest. As Tables 1 and 2 indicate, an experiment combining DU, DD, UD, and DU2 time has a better 
EER of 0.0697 and a better AFR of 0.0628 while the th value are 0.57 and 0.56, respectively. There are a 
reasonable amount of results showing the rhythm click-dynamics authentication system based on mouse 
clicks with the proposed classifier is feasible.  
 
Table 1: The results of the top five EER with FAR and FRR  
 
 
Table 2: The results of the top five AFR with FAR and FRR  
 
 
4. Conclusions 
This paper examines the usefulness of the rhythm click-dynamics authentication system based on mouse 
clicks. For facilitating the accuracy of this paper, a fixed common rhythm which is very familiar for all 
participants was used. If each legitimate user adopts a personal rhythm as the target rhythm, it will 
significantly reduce the error rate since any impostor has to guess the target rhythm. Our experiment also has 
a reasonable amount of results with the classifier used in this paper, showing rhythms clicked by a mouse can 
act as the second identifiable factor in the general password authentication systems. Our system also 
increases portability. Our system can be applied to electronics with touch or numerical input pads and can 
also be used as the standby identifiable factor in the KDA systems to improve the security of the system.
