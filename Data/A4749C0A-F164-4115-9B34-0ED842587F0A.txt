1sometimes lay eggs. Broods arise either
from fertilized (represents queen or worker)
or unfertilized (represents drones) eggs.
In the marriage process, the queen(s)
mate during their mating flights far from the
nest. A mating flight starts with a dance
performed by the queen who then starts a
mating flight during which the drones follow
the queen and mate with her in the air. In
each mating, sperm reaches the spermatheca
and accumulates them to form the genetic
pool of the colony. Each time a queen lays
fertilized eggs, she randomly retrieves a
mixture of the sperm accumulated in the
spermatheca to fertilize the egg. In practices,
the mating flight may considered as a set of
transitions in a state-space where the queen
moves between the different states in some
speed and mates with the drone encountered
at each state probability. Furthermore, the
queen initializes with some energy content
during the flight mating and returns to her
nest when the energy is within some
threshold from zero to full spermatheca.
In order to develop the algorithm, the
capability of workers is restrained in brood
care and thus each worker may be regarded
as a heuristic that acts to improve and/or
take care of a set of broods. An annealing
function is used to describe the probability
of a drone (D) that successfully mates with
the queen (Q) shown in Eq. (1).
)](/)(exp[),( tSfDQP  (1)
where )( f is the absolute difference of
the fitness of D and the fitness of Q, and the
)(tS is the speed of queen at time t. After
each transition of mating, the queen’s speed 
and energy are decayed according to the
following equation:
)()1( tStS   (2)
where  is the decreasing factor
( ]1,0[ ). Workers adopt some heuristic
mechanisms such as crossover or mutation
to improve the brood’s genotype. The fitness
of the resulting genotype is determined by
evaluating the value of the objective
function of the brood genotype. It is
important to note that a brood has only one
genotype. The popular five construction
stages of the HBMO algorithm had been
proposed by Fathian et al. The five stages
are described as follow:
(1).The algorithm starts with the mating
flight, where a queen (best solution)
selects drones probabilistically to form
the spermatheca (list of drones). A
drone then selected from the list
randomly for the creation of broods.
(2).Creation of new broods by crossover the
drone’s genotypes with the queens. 
(3). Use of workers to conduct local search
on broods (trial solutions).
(4). Adaptation of worker’s fitness, based on 
the amount of improvement achieved on
broods.
(5). Replacement of weaker queen by fitter
broods.
2.Material and Methods
In this study, we applied the honey bee
mating optimization method for designing
algorithms for three image processing
problems that are multi-level image
thresholds selection, HBMO-based image
vector quantization and contour detection for
snake deformable model based on HBMO.
In the sequential section, the multi-level
image thresholds selection is introduced in
this Section 2.1. Meanwhile, the
HBMO-based image vector quantization is
described in this Section 2.2. Finally, the
algorithm of snake deformable model for
contour detection based on the HBMO
algorithm is introduced in Section 2.3.

The minimum cross entropy thresholding
(MCET) algorithm selects these thresholds
3In this step, a population of broods is
generated based on matting between the
queen and the drones stored in the queen’s 
spermatheca. At first the j-th individual is
selected if the random number jR is less than
a user-defined breeding ratio cP to breed.
The breeding process can transfer the genes
of drones and the queen to the j-th individual
based on the Eq. (13).

The jBrood is a brood that generated by the
queen and the j-th individual of spermatheca
of queen. The parameter  is randomly
generated in the interval [0, 1]
Stage 4. Brood mutation with the royal
jelly by works.
The population of broods is improved by
applying the mutation operators as follows:
Step1. For all broods, the random number
iR of i-th brood is generated.
Step 2. The i-th brood needs mutation if the
iR is more than the predefined mutation ratio
mP based on the Eq. (14). For the mutated
brood iBrood , the only one gene
k
iX do
the mutation. The k is randomly selected in
integer interval (1,…,c).

bestbrood is superior to the queen, the queen

finish the algorithm, else generate new

2,3. Image Vector Quantization
Algorithm via Honey Bee Mating
Optimization
This section provides some basic
concepts of vector quantization and
introduces the traditional LBG algorithm.
2.3.1. Definition.
Vector quantization (VQ) is a lossy
data compression technique in block coding.
The generation of codebook is known as the
most important process of VQ. Let the size
of original image  ijyY 
be MM  pixels that divided into several
blocks with size of nn pixels. In other

the codebook is denoted
as ),...,,( 21 jLjjj cccc  . The VQ techniques
assign each input vector to a related
codeword, and the codeword will replace the
associated input vectors finally to obtain the
aim of compression.
The optimization of C in terms of mean
square error (MSE) can be formulated by
minimizing the distortion function D. In
general, the lower the value of D is, the
better the quality of C will be.

Stage 3 (Breeding Process)
In the breeding process, the queen
randomly selects a sperm jSp from the
spermatheca if the corresponding random
parameter jR is smaller than the predefined
parameter cP . The new brood is generated
from the queen Q and the sperm jSp by
using the Eq. (27).

Stage 4. (Brood mutation with the royal jelly

The population of broods is improved
by applying the mutation operators as
follows:
Step 1. For all broods, the random number
iR of i
th brood is generated.
Step 2. If the iR is less than the predefined
mutation ratio mP , the one tenth
codewords of ith codebook (brood) are
randomly select to mutate according to
the Eq. (28).

Step 3. The best brood, bestbrood with
maximum fitness value is selected
from all broods as the candidate queen.
Step 4. If the fitness of bestbrood is superior
to the queen, we replace queen
by bestbrood .
Stage 5. Check the termination criterion
If the termination criterion is satisfied
then finish the algorithm, else discard the all
previous trial solutions (brood set). Then go
to stage 2 until the assigned iteration
completed.
4. Experimental Results
4.1. Results of multi-level image
thresholds selection
In this section, the proposed algorithm is
employed to solve the multilevel image
thresholding. The PSO based multilevel
threshold selection based on the cross
entropy criterion is implemented for later
comparison. All programs are designed by
using the Matlab package under a personal
computer with 2.4GHz CPU, 1G RAM with
Microsoft windows XP system. Two
popular images, that are Lena and Pepper
with image size 256256, respectively, are
used for conducting by using the four
methods in experiments. The two images are
shown in Fig.1.

In order to consistent comparisons, two
performance indicators that are peak signal

measure, are used. For the sake of
completeness we define PSNR, measured in

4.2. Results of HBMO-based image vector
quantization
The typical experiments for evaluating the
methods used for codebook design are the
grayscale image coding. Five 512512
stil images named “LENA”, “PEPPER”, 
“BABOON”, “GOLDHILL” and “Lake” 
with pixel amplitude resolution of 8 bits are
shown in Fig. 2. In coding an image, the
image is completely divided into immediate
and non-overlapping blocks with 44
pixels. Each block is treated as a pattern
input vector with 16 dimensions.
Therefore, there exist a total of 16384
vectors to be encoded in an image. In
experiments, six different codebook sizes
that are 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024
images are implemented. We compare the
HBMO-LBG method with three algorithms,
including the traditional LBG, the particle
swarm optimization (PSO)-based LBG and
the quantum particle swarm optimization
(QPSO)-based LGB algorithms. The
programs of the four algorithms are designed
in language of Matlab under a personal
computer with 2.4GHz CPU, 1G RAM with
window XP system. In the implementation
of HBMO-LBG algorithm, it needs many
parameters that are predefined. The used
parameters are set of the one queen, fifteen
drones, five sperms, 98.0 , 8.0cP ,
1.0mP and 5.0 . The bit rate is
defined in Eq. (29).

The cN represents the size of designed

defined as

it can rapidly converge. The segmentation
