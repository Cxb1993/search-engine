To test the occurrence of oscillation, the impedance seen at 
the intersection plane of A_A’ indicated in Fig. 2a is 
examined. During calculation the A-A’ is disconnected 
without disturbing the dc bias. A small ac voltage source is 
inserted and the input impedance is then calculated by 
measuring the current. The oscillation starts as long as the 
real part of impedance is negative and imaginary part crosses 
the zero axis with positive slope. Both conditions are also 
equivalent to the Barkhausen’s conditions. The design factors 
have C1, C2 size, MOS dimension, size of switching 
capacitance, and varactor size. Capacitance C1, C2 are traded 
off in area and negative resistance. MOS dimensions are 
traded off is between phase noise and tuning. Phase noise 
gets better as MOS area is enlarged. However, its parasitic 
degrades the tuning capability. The parameters of transistors 
are extracted from TSMC 0.18um CMOS process. The aspect 
ratio of M2 and M5 are 60/.18 and 30/.18, respectively. The 
current consumption in the core is 2,68mA. The effects of 
bonding wire and pads are also taken into account. The 
results by using microwave software ADS is shown in Fig. 3. 
The starting frequency is determined from the zero crossing 
point of the imaginary part, which is equal to 425.1MHz as 
denoted M8.

For clearance, the capability of the balanced Colpitts 
oscillator as shown in Fig. 2b is also examined. It is basically 
built from two single-ended Colpitts oscillator sharing one 
SAW resonator. M7 and M8 are the main amplifiers and M9 
and M10 are the current sources. For comparison, a single 
ended Colpitts with similar model is firstly constructed. One 
pin of the resonator is connected to ground. With this success, 
the balanced one is easily obtained just by copying the single 
ended one and connecting the resonator to the gates of the 
main amplifiers. The SAW resonator now is re-modeled as 
two series resonators with center point virtually grounded [7, 
8]. The ac swing across the SAW resonator in each oscillator 
is set equal to 100mV by trimming the aspect ratio of the 
transistors. The current consumptions of the core circuit 
without buffer are listed in Table II. Die size and phase noise 
are also indicated. It reveals that output power and turn-on 
transition in cross-coupled oscillator are the best. The turn-on 
transitions in cross-coupled pair and single-ended Colpitts are 
shown in Fig. 4. The former is about 150us in Fig. 4a and the 
latter is about 500us in Fig. 4b. The Balanced Colpitts is the 
worst. Because no strong force exists to identify the polarity, 
the transition period may take a long time. According to our 
observation, it takes about 5ms (not shown here). The cross 
coupled one as expected has the shorted transition time.  
Phase noise is medium. The single-ended one has the best 
about -159.2dBc at 1Mhz offset. It seems to be due to just 
only one active transistor. As for the high power 
consumption in balanced Colpitts is due to the doubling in 
equivalent Co capacitance, which degrades the negative 
resistance.
