   INTRODUCTION 
 
Unlike the two-port network, using S-parameters of a three-port network in 
the design of microwave amplifiers or oscillators is still lacking of the explicit 
expressions to describe their stabilities, especially in the microwave CAD tools. It 
then gives the motivation of this work, to resolve the stability problems of a 
three-port network.  
The expressions for the unconditional stability of a two-port network are 
derived and based on its reflection coefficients inΓ and outΓ [1]-[4]. Specifically, 
the input reflection coefficients at port 1 and port 2 being unity, 1inΓ =  and 
1outΓ = , yields two stability circles in the 2Γ -plane of the port 2 and 1Γ -plane of 
the port 1. The unconditional stability boundaries of a two-port network can then be 
3  
unconditionally stable, simultaneous conjugate matches are usually adopted to the 
design of the terminating networks as in a microwave amplifier. If it is 
conditionally stable, simultaneous conjugate matches only exist for certain loads. 
The following discussion about the stability conditions is focused on the input and 
output reflection coefficients from the terminating ports of a two-port network. 
1.1.1 Stability Conditions 
The expressions for the stability of a two-port network are based on its 
reflection coefficients inΓ and outΓ  given as [1]-[4].

and 2Γ  are the reflection coefficients of the terminating networks. If either the 
input or output reflection coefficient has a negative real part [5]-[7], oscillation 
becomes possible for 1inΓ >  or 1outΓ > . On the contrary, the two-port 
network is stable if 1inΓ <  and 1outΓ < .

Consider the input stability circle of load 2 in the 2Γ -plane as shown in 
Fig. 1.2. If one sets the impedance of load 2 as 2 0Z Z= , then 2 0Γ =  gives 
11in SΓ = . Now if 11 1S < , it implies 1inΓ < . Hence, 2 0Γ =  is in the stability 
region. The area inside Smith chart ( 2 1Γ < ) and the exterior of the input stability 
circle then defines the conditional stability region for 2Γ  as shown in Fig. 1.2. 
Otherwise, if 11 1S > , then the stability region is the region inside the stability 
circle that intersects the unitary Smith chart. Similar results are applied to the 
output stability circle of load 1 in the 1Γ -plane. 
7  
As a summary, the input reflection coefficients at port 1 and port 2 being 
ones, 1inΓ =  and 1outΓ = , yield two stability circles or boundaries for the 
stability region in the 1Γ -plane and 2Γ -plane. Because the unconditional 
stability is relatively essential for the microwave amplifier design, the analysis to 
be presented in this report for the stability is focused on this issue. 
1.1.2 Stability Factor 
The major concern about stability is for designing the microwave 
amplifiers. The degree of stability for an amplifier can be quantified by the 
stability factor. There are several different expressions of stability factors, such as 
Linvil stability factor [8], [9], Stern stability factor [10], and Rollett stability 
factor [11]-[13] which specify conditions that must be satisfied for the 
unconditional stability of a two-port amplifier. 
The Linvil stability factor is expressed in terms of Y-parameters as [8], [9]

following sufficient conditions [16]-[18] for the completion.

reciprocal of the Rollett stability factor K  for allowing the single-condition 
criterion to be expressed in a particularly simple form [20].  
Equations (1.11) and (1.12) can be further combined in a single parameter 
criterion of stability factor [21]. Moreover, a popular single inequality for stability 
criteria is expressed as [22]-[28]

reflection coefficients given as inΓ  and outΓ . Note the two-port circuit within 
the dashed-line box can also be viewed as a two-port series-feedback network as 
shown in Fig. 1.3(c) which is a common configuration of series-feedback 
amplifier or series-feedback oscillator. In this case, the load 3 is named the 
feedback network and loads 1 and 2 are the terminating networks.

determinant of [ ijS ].  
The unconditional stability condition for the three-port network given by 
ports 1 and 2 with port 3 terminated with 3Γ  as shown in Fig. 1.3(b) is known to 
have (1.17) and (1.18) satisfying 1outΓ <  and 1inΓ <  for all two passive 
terminations at port 1 and port 2 (i.e., 1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ < ).

used to determine the three unconditional stability regions of a three-port network. 
The approach in [30] also views a three-port network as three two-port 
networks, but uses the stability factor 3μ  [22]-[28] in order to reduce the number 
of inequalities from nine to three. At this viewpoint, the three unconditional 
stability regions can be plotted based on three inequalities and a root search 
algorithm.  
The approaches in [29] and [30] based on inequality equations provide the 
analytical methods used to plot the unconditional stability regions of a three-port 
network. This report begins with the reduction of a three-port network to a 
two-port network by terminating port 3 with 3Γ . The requirements of the 
unconditional stability are then applied for the input reflection coefficients inΓ  
and outΓ  at port 1 and port 2 to acquire the explicit expressions describing the 
stability characteristics to be presented in Chapter 2. 
1.2.2 Stability Factor 
Based on (1.11), the stability factor of a three-port network with port 3 
terminated with load 3Γ  as shown in Fig. 1.3(b) can be expressed as [29] 
17  
to derive the explicit expressions on the stability of a three-port network.  
In Chapter 2, two analyses are focused on deriving the expressions on the 
boundaries in the 3Γ -plane satisfying the requirements of the unconditional 
stability for all 1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ < . Since these two approaches provide the 
explicit expressions of the unconditional stability boundaries of a three-port 
network, they can be directly implemented by microwave circuit designer using 
software tools, for example Agilent ADS [31].  
1.4 Chapter Outlines 
In Chapter 2 on the derivation of the boundaries of the unconditional 
stability regions of a three-port network, two approaches are presented. Graphical 
approach is described in Sec. 2.1.1 to show that the tangent point of the two 
stability circles is the extreme point satisfying (1.17) and (1.18) for 1inΓ =  and 
1outΓ = . Therefore, the boundary of the unconditional stability region can be 
plotted by tracing the tangent points through properly varying 1Γ  and 2Γ . 
The explicit expression of the unconditional stability boundary in the 
3Γ -plane is then derived in Sec. 2.2.2. Additionally, the expressions for the 
19  
In order to verify the expressions developed in Chapter 2, the numerical 
examples given in [29], [30] are adopted in Chapter 2, to illustrate and verify the 
effectiveness of the developed analytical approaches. Finally the conclusion is 
given in Chapter 3. 
  21
1outΓ =  then give two stability circles in the 3Γ -plane. Note this treatment of a 
three-port network being a two-port network given by port 1 and port 2 with port 3 
terminated with 3Γ  should also be performed for two other cases in order to fully 
characterize the boundaries of the unconditional stability regions in the termination 
planes of 1Γ , 2Γ , and 3Γ . One case is to terminate port 2 with 2Γ  for the 
derivation of the boundary expression in the 2Γ -plane, and the other case is to 
terminate port 1 with 1Γ  for the derivation of boundary expression in the 
1Γ -plane.  
2.1 Graphic Approach 
The unconditional stability condition for the two-port network given by 
ports 1 and 2 with port 3 terminated with 3Γ  as shown in Fig. 1.3(b) is known to 
have (1.17) and (1.18) satisfying 1outΓ <  and 1inΓ <  for all passive 
terminations at port 1 and port 2 (i.e., 1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ < ) [1]-[4]. The 
following analysis is focused on deriving the expressions on the boundary of the 
region in the 3Γ -plane satisfying the unconditional stability requirement for all 
1Γ  and 2Γ  inside the Smith chart based on the graphic approach. 
  23
expressions of two circles in the 3Γ -plane. As 1AΓ  or 2AΓ  is a positive value, 
corresponds to the exterior region of circle and vice versa. 
 Note that (2.1) and (2.2) are inequality expressions of two circles in the 
3Γ -plane, and are functions of 1Γ  and 2Γ  respectively. This indicates that a 
three-port network terminated with 3Γ  is unconditionally stable if and only if 
3Γ  satisfies (2.1) and (2.2) for all passive terminations at ports 1 and 2. Therefore, 
for values of 1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ <  in the 1Γ - and 2Γ -planes, one can identify 
two circles in the 3Γ -plane to be the unconditional stability circles 1^  and 2^  
with 1inΓ =  and 1outΓ =  as

2 3 2 2 2 2 0.A C B A CΓ Γ Γ Γ ΓΓ − + − =              (2.10) 
In the following, a discussion is described by using graphs in Fig. 2.1 and 
Fig. 2.2 to find the adequate values of 3Γ  for the two-port network given by port 
1 and port 2 to be unconditionally stable. The approach to determine the explicit 
expressions on the boundary of unconditional stability region in the 3Γ -plane 
ensues.  
As 1AΓ  or 2AΓ  expressed in (2.3) or (2.6) is a positive value, the exterior

with (a) 1^  circle and (c) 2^  circle moving apart until the 
extreme cases with two circles to be (b) circumscribed and (d) 
inscribed respectively. 
  27
For the case with 1 0AΓ < , 2 0AΓ > , and the shaded region A  in Fig. 
2.1(b) being the stability region, the intersection points 1P  and 2P  are on the 
boundary of the unconditional stability region in the 3Γ -plane for certain 1Γ  
and 2Γ  values. Since we are trying to find the boundary of the unconditional 
stability region of 3Γ  for 1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ < , a stability circle '1^  must exist 
inside 1^  as shown in Fig. 2.2(a) by properly changing the 1Γ  value to give a 
smaller stability region 'A . The two intersection points 1P  and 2P  are then 
replaced by points '1P  and 
'
2P  until the two stability circles circumscribe one 
another as shown in Fig. 2.2(b). The resulting tangent point P  is then a point on 
the boundary of the unconditional stability region in the 3Γ -plane for all passive 
loads at port 1 and port 2, since further movement of the '1^  circle gives no 
intersection point or causes no 3Γ  value satisfying (2.9) and (2.10). 
For the case with 1 0AΓ > , and 2 0AΓ < , the shaded region A  in Fig. 
2.1(c) is similar to the stability region in Fig. 2.1(b). Therefore, the boundary of 
the unconditional stability region in the 3Γ -plane for all the passive loads at port 
1 and port 2 is also similar to the result of Fig. 2.2(b). 
For the case with 1 0AΓ <  and 2 0AΓ <  as shown in Fig. 2.1(d) with the 
  29
of the unconditional stability region can be derived in the 3Γ -plane for 1 1Γ <  
and 2 1Γ < . Moreover, each 3Γ  value gives the stability circles in the 2Γ - and 
1Γ -planes from (1.19)-(1.22). Since the tangent point P of these two stability 
circles described in Sec. 2.1.1 is on the unconditional stability boundary in the 
3Γ -plane which satisfies 1inΓ =  and 1outΓ =  as 1 1Γ =  and 2 1Γ = , the 
point P then gives the corresponding stability circles in the 2Γ - and 1Γ -planes 
which inscribes or circumscribes their unitary Smith charts to enclose the stable 
regions 1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ < . Therefore, the boundaries of the Γ1 - and Γ2 -plane 
for passive loads are the outer circles of Smith chart with unit magnitude given by 
1
ie αΓ =  and 2 ie βΓ = . Therefore, the two extreme cases shown in Figs. 2.2(b) 
and (d) for 1^  and 2^ , found to be tangential to one another, are caused by the 
proper values of α  and β  on the outer circles of Smith charts for Γ1  and Γ2  
respectively.  
By substituting 1
ie αΓ =  and 2 ie βΓ =  into (2.9) and (2.10), the 
expressions of stability circles 1^  and 2^  become 
2 2
3 1 1 ,T RΓ ΓΓ − =                      (2.11) 
2 2
3 2 2T RΓ ΓΓ − = .                     (2.12) 
  31
Since the intersection point of 1^  and 2^  is a single point P  as 
shown in Figs. 2.2(b) and (d), the coefficients of (2.16) should satisfy the 
discrimination equation 
2 0b ac− =                           (2.20) 
to yield the solution of (2.16), or the x  value of point P , as 
2
bx
a
= − .                        (2.21) 
The y  value of the tangent point P  can then be acquired by substituting (2.21) 
into (2.15). 
Therefore, the boundary of the unconditional stability region of 3Γ  for 
1 1Γ <  and 2 1Γ <  can be traced from (2.15) and (2.21) by knowing α  and 
β  in the Γ1 - and Γ2 -planes. In the following subsection, the relation of α  
and β  will be derived to yield 1^  and 2^ , which will be two tangent circles 
based on (2.20). With the use of this relation, one can directly calculate the 
corresponding α  (or β ) value by sweeping a single parameter β  (or α ) 
around the outer circle of the Smith chart. 
  33
The proofs of (2.24) and (2.25) are tedious and not given, however, they can be an 
indicator of the correct solution of α  in (2.26).

Equation (2.22) is a quadratic equation of sinα and cosα  and its 
coefficients are functions of β . Therefore, by giving a β  value for 2Γ , there 
are two values of α  for 1Γ  given by (2.28) and (2.29). This then leads two 3Γ  
points traced from (2.15) and (2.21). However, the square operation for (2.22) 
being (2.23) gives four possible α  solutions of (2.23). Therefore, all four 
solutions given by (2.28) and (2.29) should be substituted into (2.22) to identify 
the two correct α  values.  
In order to trace the boundary of the unconditional stability region in the 
  35
of β  in terms of α  as in that of (2.22). At this point, the expressions are 
acquired as those of (2.28) and (2.29) for β  values, and the boundary of the 
unconditional stability region is plotted accordingly. 
2.1.4 Uniqueness 
Since the boundary plotting approach described in Sec. 2.1.3 is a 
one-to-two mapping from one β  value in the 2Γ -plane to two α  values in the 
1Γ -plane then to two 3Γ  values in the 3Γ -plane, its uniqueness needs to be 
verified. In this subsection, it will be proven that the inverse mapping from the 
boundary of the unconditional stability region in the 3Γ -plane to the 1Γ -plane 
and the consequent 2Γ -plane is a one-to-one mapping. Only one of the 
boundaries derived in Sec. 2.1.3 is the boundary of the unconditional stability 
region.  
Substituting 1
ie αΓ =  and 2 ie βΓ =  into (2.1) and (2.2) and moving the 
terms of α  and β  to the right side, results in 
2 cos( )G U U α> ∠ − ,                        (2.30) 
2 cos( )H V V β> ∠ − ,                         (2.31) 
  37

iV e
V
β= = Γ .                        (2.41) 
Equations (2.40) and (2.41) indicate that the corresponding values of α  
and β  in the 1Γ - and 2Γ -planes are uniquely determined from the 
unconditional stability boundary of 3Γ  in the 3Γ -plane. Therefore, the criteria 
of 0G >  and 0H >  may be imposed upon the two acquired boundaries 
described in Sec. 2.1.3 to identify the correct one for the unconditional stability 
region. 
2.1.5 Continuity 
In the subsection, the continuity issue on the plotting of the unconditional 
stability boundary will be discussed. Since (2.22) is a polynomial equation of 
sinα  and cosα , its solutions are continuous from 0D  to 360D . This then leads 
to the unconditional stability boundary being continuous based on the linear 
operation of (2.15) and (2.21). Similarly, the reverse mapping is also continuous 
from the 3Γ -plane to the 1Γ - and 2Γ -planes by (2.40) and (2.41). Therefore, all 
solutions of (2.22), by sweeping β  value over the range from 0D  to 360D  in 
the 2Γ -plane, will give a continuous closed curve in the 3Γ -plane to be the 
boundary of the unconditional stability region for a three-port network terminated 
  39
 The first example is to use the three-port S-matrix in [29] given as

In this following study, all expressions developed in this Section are 
implemented in Agilent ADS [31] to enhance its computer-aided capability of the 
stability analysis of a three-port network.  
The procedure for plotting the boundaries of the unconditional stability 
regions starts with the case of the termination 3Γ  at port 3 as described in this 
section. Basically, the α  value is calculated using (2.28) and (2.29) by sweeping 
the β  value from 0D  to 360D  with a step of 0.01D . With the use of (2.15) and 
(2.21), two stability boundaries are then plotted in the 3Γ -plane as shown in Fig. 
2.3. Plots of the corresponding β  values in the 2Γ -plane and α  values in the 
1Γ -plane are shown Figs. 2.4(a) and (b) respectively. 
Fig. 2.3(a) illustrates that there are two closed curves of the stability 
boundaries in the 3Γ -plane based on (2.15) and (2.21). The one inside the Smith  
  41
verify which side of the plotted boundary will be the unconditional stability 
region in the 3Γ -plane. For the boundary given in Fig. 2.3(b), since the origin 
point 3 0Γ =  gives 2 210 1 12 r iF F F< + and 2 220 2 22 r iF F F< + , the unconditional 
stability region then excludes the origin of smith chart as shown in Fig. 2.3(b) 
identified by the shaded region. 
Results of the corresponding β  values in the 2Γ -plane and α  values 
in the 1Γ -plane are given in Figs. 2.4(a) and (b). Note that they are non-closed 
curves as explained in Sec. 2.1.5 due to 0D <  in (2.28) and (2.29) for certain 
α  and β  values. Therefore, an unconditional stable three-port network can be 
designed with the use of the passive terminations 1Γ  and 2Γ  except those on 
the thick heavy lines given in Figs. 2.4(a) and (b) and the passive terminations 
3Γ  within the shaded region in Fig. 2.3(b). 
With the use of the same expressions implemented in the Agilent ADS, 
two other unconditional stability boundaries may be readily plotted for the 
terminations 1Γ  and 2Γ  by properly rearranging the S-parameters given in 
(2.42) as 
  43
and α  values for the termination 2Γ  at port 2 are shown in Fig. 2.5. The  
shaded region is the region of unconditional stability verified by 0G >  and 
0H > , and it excludes the origin because of 2 210 1 12 r iF F F< + and 
2 2
20 2 22 r iF F F< +  for 2 0Γ = .  
Similarly, results of the unconditional stability region and the 
corresponding β  and α  values for the termination 1Γ  at port 1 are shown in 
Fig. 2.6. The shaded region is the region of unconditional stability verified by 
0G >  and 0H > , and it includes the origin because of 2 210 1 12 r iF F F> + and 
2 2
20 2 22 r iF F F> +  for 1 0Γ = .  
As shown in Figs 2.3(b), 2.5(a), and 2.6(a), all the unconditional stability 
boundaries for 1Γ , 2Γ , and 3Γ  are shown in agreement with those derived by 
plotting the unconditional stability regions using nine inequities in [29] or using 
three inequities with root searching algorithm in [30]. 
With the use of the developed analytical approach, the unconditional 
stability boundaries can be directly plotted based on closed-form expressions, and 
they also provide useful information on the corresponding extreme values of α  
and β . Moreover, plots of the boundaries of unstable regions can be acquired.

3 14 4b ba P M J= − + , and, 24 1a M= − , Therefore, similar to the procedure in 
(2.60)-(2.62), the roots of (2.63) can be acquired by sweeping the x value form -1 
to 1 corresponding to the range of the real part of the impedance inside of the 
Smith chart for 3Γ  value. 
2.2.3 Sufficient Conditions 
As Sec. 1.2.2, the sufficient conditions of a three-port network to be 
unconditionally stable are (1.25) and (1.26). They can be expressed as  
1X J> ,                       (2.64) 
 2X J> .                       (2.65) 
To solve the conditional instability boundaries based on 1X J=  and 2X J= , 
one can substitute 3 x yiΓ = +  into 1X J=  and 2X J=  to acquire the 
  55
real part of the impedance inside of the Smith chart, one can acquire the same 
resulting 3Γ  values as those from (2.48). 
2.2.4 Examples 
In order to compare the results of this approach with the results of the 
graph approach given in Sec. 2.1.6, the same S-matrix (2.42) is used and the 
expressions given above are implemented with the Agilent ADS [31] to plot the 
unconditional stability boundaries of the given S-matrix in 1Γ -, 2Γ -, and 
3Γ -planes. The results are shown in Figs. 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 respectively. The 
procedure to plot the boundaries of the unconditional stability regions is 
summarized as the following. 
(1) The S-parameter matrix given in (2.42) can be transferred to (2.43) or 
(2.44). It depends on the selected port to connect with the feedback 
network.  
(2) Calculate the values of 11Δ , 22Δ , 33Δ , 21Δ , 12Δ , and 3Δ  defined in 
(1.18) and (2.46). 
(3) Set the initial the value of ξ , and then calculate the corresponding

values of 2M , 1aP , 1bP , 1cP , 3aP , 3bP , 4aP , and 4bP  for the

2xM , 2x aP , 2x bP , and 2x cP  for the 
expressions of 1X J>  and 2X J>  given in (2.66) and (2.67).   
(4) Calculate parameters of aJ , bJ , cJ , tanθ , 1D , 3D , 4D , and 5D  
given in (2.48)-(2.51) in order to solve 1X J= , 2X J= , and 1K =  
by the root-solving method. 
  59
unconditional stability regions as those in Figs. 2.6(a), 2.5(a), and 2.3(a). This 
verifies the procedures (1) to (8) given above for the root-solving approach are 
effective in plotting the unconditional stability regions.   
2.3 Summary  
Two analytical approaches to derive the explicit expressions on the 
unconditional stability boundaries of a three-port network are presented. Differing 
from the approaches that use inequality equations to express the unconditional 
stability regions, these methods can be directly implemented in Agilent ADS or 
commercially available software tools, for example Microsoft Excel, for the 
stability analysis of a three-port network in an effective manner. The 
unconditional stability boundary for each selected port, for example expressed by 
(2.15) and (2.21) in the 3Γ -plane, is shown to be unique and continuous due to 
0G >  and 0H > . In addition, the locally continuous boundaries for the two 
corresponding terminations, expressed, for example by (2.28) and (2.29), or (2.40) 
and (2.41) for α  values in the 1Γ -plane and β  values in the 2Γ -plane to 
yield the resulting unconditional stability region can be acquired. The root-solving

3.1 Summary 
This study develops the explicit expressions on the stability analysis of a 
three-port network. They are shown in a computational effective manner in the 
computer aided design by directly implemented in Agilent ADS software.  
In Chapter 2, two analytical approaches to acquire the explicit expressions 
on the unconditional stability boundaries of a three-port network are presented. 
One is based on the graphic approach using stability circles to find the expression 
of their tangent point. The other is based on the root-solving approach using 
  63
item to be studied. By combining the developed expressions based on the stability 
considerations with the expressions based on the power gain considerations, it is 
then useful for the design of a three-port active network. 
The third item is the generalization of the developed stability analyses of the 
three-port network to the n-port network. This work is then expected to involve 
intensive algebraic expressions and matrix operations.

Abstract— A media with negative refractive index (NRI) can be 
utilized to focus a point source from one side of NRI material to 
another side. However, one of the main obstacles to form the 
image is the material loss. It would smear the finer details of the 
image. In this paper, a method is presented to compensate the 
losses by embedding an injection-locked oscillator near the focus 
region of the NRI material. With the use of injection locking 
technique, the oscillator is operated at the same frequency of the 
input point source but provides with higher power at the focus 
region. The measured results reveal the loss compensation by 
using this approach. 
Index Terms —Metamaterials, negative refractive index. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The metamaterial is a material whose permittivity and 
permeability are both negative [1], and is also called left-
handed (LH) material or negative refractive index (NRI) 
material. One of the intriguing properties of metamaterial is its 
negative refraction. Through negative refraction, 
electromagnetic wave on one side of a NRI lens will refocus 
on the other side to achieve super-resolution. It is well known 
as a perfect lens which overcomes the diffraction limit of the 
conventional slab lens made by positive refractive index (PRI) 
material [2]. The perfect imaging is only achievable as the 
PRI/NRI materials are lossless, have a relative refractive 
index of -1 with respect to each other and are impedance 
matched.    
However, the losses are always inevitable for the PRI/NRI 
lens. There are three types of losses, the material dielectric 
loss, the metallic loss and the loss associated with the 
impedance mismatch on the interface between PRI/NRI 
materials. They would smear and cause to lose the finer 
details of the image.  
Recently, Ramakrishna and Pendry [3] suggest a method to 
resolve the absorption loss by introducing optical gain into the 
lens made from a multilayer stack of thin alternating layers of 
silver and dielectric medium at ultraviolet and infrared 
frequencies. In [4], Kozyrev presents the idea by using LH 
nonlinear medium which has the characteristic of parametric 
generation to build the active lens to compensate the inherent 
LH medium loss. 
In this paper, a method is presented to compensate these 
losses by embedding an oscillator near the focus region of 
NRI material. The free-running frequency of this oscillator is 
then injection locked to an external signal used as the point 
source. Firstly, in Section ΙΙ, analysis and simulation of the 
unit cell of NRI material are described. Then, design of a 
passive lens with the embedded oscillator design is given in 
Section ΙΙΙ. The experimental results of the passive lens 
without and with the oscillator are discussed in Section ΙV. 
Finally, a conclusion is given in Section V. 
II. ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION OF UNIT CELL 
Fig. 1(a) illustrates the unit cell design parameters of the 
NRI material. The implementation of unit cell is based on the 
composite microstrip line/CPW structure. The upper metal is 
microstrip line structure, and the lower one is CPW structure.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The measurement is performed by using an Agilent E8364B 
PNA in two-port measurement mode. The PNA port 1 is 
connected to the source point in the region of left PRI material. 
The port 2 is connected to an Agilent 85024A active probe 
which scans over the surface of the lens to record the S21 value 
at each cell. Two samples are prepared. One is a passive lens 
whereas the other is a passive lens with an embedded 
oscillator for comparison.  
Fig. 4(a) shows the measured S21 magnitude at 2.214GHz 
of the passive lens in linear scale. The focus and refocus 
phenomena can be observed in the NRI material and the right 
side PRI material. Due to the losses of material dielectric, 
metal and the impedance mismatch, the power distribution 
shows decreasing gradually in the focus and refocus regions. 
The S21 magnitude at the source excitation point is about -
10dB. The maximal S21 magnitude in the refocus region is 
about 20dB lower than the level of the source excitation. In 
addition, because of the difference of refraction indices of PRI 
and NRI materials, the focus region degenerates into a diffuse 
region. Fig. 4(b) shows the phase distribution of S21 of the 
passive lens. The reversal of wavefront can be observed in the 
region of NRI material and the right side PRI material. It 
demonstrates the focusing phenomenon of negative refraction 
index of NRI material.  
Fig. 5 shows the measured S21 magnitude at the oscillator 
output which is located at 7th row and 15th column. The 
locking range is shown about from 2.12GHz to 2.26GHz. The 
point source frequency is the same as that in the passive lens 
case. The DC bias of the gate, drain and varactor of the 
oscillator are 0.6V, 4.6V and 3.23V. The DC current is about 
44mA. The output power of PNA is 10dBm.  
Fig. 6(a) shows the measured S21 magnitude in linear scale 
of the lens with an injection-locked oscillator. The dark color

region in the NRI material is the location of oscillator. Due to 
an oscillator embedded in the NRI material, the power 
distribution in the refocus region of the right side PRI material 
is enhanced and clearly observed. By having the same S21 
magnitude of -10dB, the S21 magnitude in the refocus region 
is shown about 5dB lower compared with the source 
excitation. It is then the losses being reduced by about 15dB 
comparing with the case in Fig. 4. In other words, the losses 
of material dielectric loss, metallic loss and the impedance 
mismatch over PRI/NRI materials are compensated with the
