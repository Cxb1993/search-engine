hand/arm towards a specific object, location, and/or a direction.  Among the set of gestures 
performed by humans when communicated with each other and/or with machines, pointing 
movement has the most spatial compatibility.   
In recognition pointing movements, the detections of the occurrence of the 
finger-hand-arm movements and the pointing directions have to be addressed (Kai, et al., 
2003). Most of pointing movement system recognition forearm orientation only. Our 
previous study of remote pointing accuracy in a distance of 3 meters showed that pointing 
accuracy to a target size of 7.5 cm in radius with no visual cue, the hitting rate was only 
66.0% and the spread ranges was 7.02±5.30cm (Lee, et al., 2008).  When pointing an object, 
the eye, the finger, and the object should be collinear.  It was hypothesized in this study that 
pointing accuracy can be improved by the inclusion of the hand and head orientation into the 
determination of pointing location, (Lee, et al., 2001).  Figure 1 showed the environment of 
this remote interaction, where hand and head orientation was recognize, and the direction 
vector was determined according to the extended line of the hand and head vector.  What 
unknown is the accuracy of this goal-directed pointing movement.

The objective of this study is to refine a remote goal-directed pointing tracking system (GPTS) 
and to apply the GPTS for Chinese painting. In the study, a software for Chinese calligraphy 
was developed based on GPTS. There is a painting and an editing interface. All comments in 
the software were activated either by recognizing a natural hand posture or by an activation 
of a pull-down menu. In addition, a usability test was completed to justify the quality of the 
GPTS. 
II. GOAL-DIRECTED POINTING TRACKING SYSTEM 
In the study, we combine stereoscopic range information and skin-color classification to 
achieve a robust tracking performance. The setup consists of two fixed-baseline cameras 
connected to PC. 
3-D Calibration 
Based on data from a 2 camera system, direct linear transformation (DLT) was used to obtain 
3D coordinates for the system. Measurements of the focus, positions, rotation angles, and 
distance parameters of the two cameras were used as inputs for the calibration. 
2-D Hand/Head Area Detection 
GPTS uses skin detection and background subtraction techniques to isolate the image of 
hand and head on each frame, which is then used for direction calculation.  The skin 
detection algorithm is a modified version of that of McKenna and Morrison (2004).  
Areas of hand and head were detected by identifying ellipse cylinder skin areas in the 
ycbcr color space of the images from two cameras.  Only pixels of skin-color-liked are 
collected to a coordinate sheet.  The most memory-saving format is to use a binary 
dataset.  Erosion algorithm was used to filter out the noise. Finally, a K-means 
clustering mechanism (K=3) was used to cluster the coordinates sheet into 3 skin-area 
sets (2-D positions of the head and 2 hands).  These operations are applying onto the 
both 2 images in the initial state.

Comments in the painting interface as was illustrated in Figure 4 were defines as

1. selection of the size of the paint,  
2. selection of the brush types for the pen, 
3. selection of the hand gesture for gripping the pen,   
4. selection of the color of the inks.

Figure 4: comments in the painting interface 
One problem encounter in hand gesture interface is that it is difficult to stabilize the 
user’s hand at a fixed position. It is therefore hard to move a pointer to follow the hand’s 
position and to select or click at the intended location accurately. To solve this problem, a 
crossing bar motion that occurs twice during a short time interval is made to trigger a 
commend followed the design of Nakamura, et al., (2008). The hand movement of 
crossing is recognized by the camera so that is can be used to press a button or to select a 
menu item in the graphic user interface (UGI). Double4-corssing is a local finger gesture 
that move a finger up-and-down, left-and-right; this action is simple enough that the user 
does not need to train the system. Figure 5 illustrated the hand movement.

calligraphic interface. Other intended future work includes (a) a strong recognition 
engine using recurrent neural network model or hidden Markov model, (b) a more 
complete elements of gesture will be defined that movements in 3D spaces, moving 
speeds, and the strength of movement are more meaningful, and (c) interaction with a 
larger display at a longer distance.

以及各國學者專家的成果發表,或益意良多。由於會議場次以平行方式進行，無法
聆聽各家言論，只見各各參與人士穿梭進出各場發表會，成為場內特色。綜合而
言，此次會議特色主題有： 
1. IEA與NGO合作並向開發中國家邁進: IEA為42各會員國協的聯合組
織，下挾會員人數超過20,000，近年來最大的發展在開發中國家。IEA理事長
David C Caple – IEA President以The IEA Contribution to the Transition of 
Ergonomics from Research to Practice為題，說明IEA如何與Non 
Government Organizations合作，包括 World Health Organisation (WHO), 
International Labour Organisation (ILO), International Organisation for 
Standardization (ISO), International Commission on Occupational Health 
(ICOH), International Occupational Hygienist Association (IOHA), 
International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ICSID)，並說明如何
與開發中國家，由人因工程的技術引進與合作，發展人因工程的影響與貢獻。
進而由理論邁向實務應用，相關的論述請見圖三。

2. 高齡化社會的角色與策略: 產業醫科大學教授Masaharu Kumashiro以
Challenges for the Aging Workforce Using Ergonomics Strategies為題，說明說明
日本如何因應高齡化社會以及相關的人因工程作為，四個策略為：Strategies at 
the individual level (範例: Ensuring health, preventing lifestyle-related diseases, 
rejuvenating the physical age and estimation of functional age); Strategies at the 
workplace level Improvement: (範例: Workplace improvement (KAIZEN) 
activities developing support equipment and tools); Strategies at the company level 
(範例: Evaluating workability and building workability-based wage and benefit 
systems, horizontal development of success stories); Strategies at the state and 
regional administration levels (範例: Creating a database of company success 
stories, publicizing the database, establishing a certified employability evaluation 
system)。

中，25% 的下背痛以及23% 的肌肉痛抱怨，造成最高的請假率與40% 的補償
金支出，相當於1.6% 的全國生產淨利支出(European Agency for Safety and 
Health at Work, Work-related MSDs prevention report). 如此高的持續成
本，使得懷疑與檢視過去的作為成為必要的工作。有關人因工程改善對於MSD
的正面效果，相關近期的科學證據僅能提供中等以上的支持，如此保守的結論
之最核心的問題，仍環繞在MSD的does-response關係不明。Dr. Bongers呼
籲，相關研究應以可以整合的模式進行，以提供更快速、更完整、也更具說服
力的證據。 
(三)與會收穫 
IEA會議每兩三年召開一次，此次個人有幸獲得國科會之補助參加大會，得以參與
學術會議、協助主持、參與周邊會議，並聆賭大師級人物之風範與立論，獲益良
多。在此將所得之收穫與心得，概述於下： 
1. 促成中、日人因工程學會的合作實質：延續筆者參加日本人因學會五十
週年慶的任務與投入，兩學會成員再次於IEA2009北京會面，並確認兩學會的
合作內容。參與人員包括中華民國人因工程學會理事長林久翔教授、清華大學
王明揚教授、筆者，日方則有學會會長Susumu Saito, Ph.D. President, 日本大
學Yoshinori Horie教授、關西大學 Kotani Kentaro教授等人。討論主軸在good 
practices 的翻譯與合作發展台灣本土的good practices的工作。作業現場推動
現場人因工程改善，一直是人因工程的核心價值，透過個案的報導、說明、與
標竿學習，是放大與複製現場改善價值的最佳手法。Ergonomic good practices 
資料庫在JES不只已是網站上的重要資產，也翻譯成英文供各界引用，JES與EST
合作進行good practices中文化的工作。 
2. 參與PPCOE的理監事會議：泛太平洋人因工程會議成員，也利用IEA2009
北京會議時間，會面於大會期間，並由IEA2009舉辦人王生教授作東後，於8/11
晚上舉行，主要的議題包括：明年PPCOE與台灣高雄舉辦，第二屆EAEFS於
台灣新竹舉辦，會議支持的Asian Ergonomic Journal (AEJ)期刊停辦議題。
PPCOE在現任理事長日本產業醫科大學Komarshiro的努力下，儼然成為亞洲
跨學會、跨國家、跨東北亞、東南亞、澳紐的人因工程平台，在他退休前，有
許多交棒與傳承的工作待處理。經熱絡討論後，對於明年的PPCOE成員會盡
力支持，但希望有合理的會議費用。第二屆EAEFS於台灣新竹舉辦將與PPCOE
