This project focuses on spike reduction and 
wakeup acceleration for test scheduling and 
power management in supply-gating sys-
tem-on-a-chip. 
Two major issues in supply-gating system 
are the spike current and supply-switching time. 
To reduce the speeding up the lock-in time for 
sequential circuits after waking up, in this year’s 
project, we have developed a small-area 
low-power synchronous mirror delay, which can 
lock in the circuits in only two clock cycles. In 
this proposal, we will improve the static phase 
error and continue to develop smaller and feasi-
ble phase locking circuits. 
As for spike current as well as the associ-
ated wakeup time, we have proposed the 
post-gating input control technique and the 
pre-gating sleep-transistor allocation. These 
techniques can reduce the spike-time product to 
less than 7%. Furthermore, we have developed 
adaptive data retention CMOS circuits for spike 
reduction and wakeup acceleration. We have 
also implemented the cell library for transferring 
to the reference design flow. 
Combining the same objective for phase 
locking circuits and the rest digital cores in an 
SoC, a ‘sleepy system’ will be planned to verify 
for efficient power management.

 A sleep-mode current testable logic circuit and test method thereof is provided. 
A double-railed fine-grained power-gating CMOS logic structure with data retention 
is invented to reduce the spike current and wakeup time and to provide the 
sleep-mode current testability with high current resolution.  A simple feedback con-
trol is designed to adaptively select one of the double power switches for data reten-
tion.  This innovation is with multiple functions: low leakages and low average 
power by power gating technique, low spike current and accelerated wakeup time by 
cutting off the load charging current in sleep mode, sleep-mode current testability by 
test vector retention for bridging current driving.  The sleep-mode current test cir-
cuit is thereby invented with low test-time overhead due to wakeup acceleration.

comparison, the power-steady dissipation models are briefly re-
viewed. 
Power-Steady Dissipation 
The supply-steady power dissipation in CMOS logic circuits consists 
of dynamic and static parts. The dynamic power dissipation of gate g 
at clock t is approximated as follows. 
 2)(),(
2
1),( DDLd VgfCtgtgP τ≈ , (1) 
where f, CL and ),( tgτ  are respectively the frequency, the loading 
capacitance and the Boolean value for the transition on g at t. The 
short-circuit power dissipation is usually approximated as below. 
 3)(),(

),( tDDsc VVftgtgP −≈ τβγ , (2) 
where β is the transistor gain and γ is the ratio of the rise (fall) time 
to the period.   
As for the static power, this paper estimates the ratio of leakage 
to the total power dissipation by measuring a set of small circuits. 
Thus the total supply-steady power dissipation of the circuit with G 
gates can be estimated by our simulation-based tool as the following 
equation.

where Fg is the fanout count of gate g and L is the leakage rate.   
Power-Gating Dissipation 
Without loss of generality, considering only the circuit inserted with 
a p-type sleeping transistor illustrated as Fig. 3(a). When the sleep 
transistor is turned on and the p-network is still turned off, the first 
spike occurs like with a time constant of about RsCs, where Rs is the 
equivalent output resistance looked from the drain of the sleep tran-
sistor. Power-switching capacitance Cs is the equivalent capacitance 
including Cdg, Cdb, Cds (subscripts d, g, b and s denote drain, gate, 
bulk and source, respectively) of the sleep transistor and Csg, Csb, Csd 
of the pioneer transistors (the transistor most neighboring to the 
sleeping transistor) in the p-network. If the p-network is turned on 
after an input delay td, the loading capacitance CL is then charged to 
VDD. Fig. 3(b) shows the power-up spikes in this case.

Fig. 3 A power-gated circuit and the typical spikes.  
Obviously, the gate delay is critical to the accumulated spike but 
this model is sufficient to illustrate the effect of spike reduction using 
our scheme. Based on the peak-power model using energy-per-cycle 
under the assumption of zero delay, only the total charge during the 
supply switching time is considered. As a result, the spike defined in 
this paper will be proportional to the total equivalent capacitance 
looked from the sleeping transistor.

where v means the gate output value and n is the sleeping transistor 
type (0 for p-type and 1 for n-type). 
Note that the loading capacitance CL is also assumed to be pro-
portional to the fanout count Fg. The spike through an ng-type sleep 
transistor in this paper is then estimated as 
 
1ˆ))((ˆ PFvnKKP

where the spike unit, 1ˆP , the power-gating dissipation factor, Ks, and 
the loading dissipation factor, KL, will be estimated by comparing to 
the SPICE simulation result using a set of small circuits. Note that 
the weighted transition count (WTC), Pˆ , is not accurate for all cir-
cuits but enough to be used as a heuristics.  
PROPOSED SCHEME 
Fig. 4 shows the basic concept of proposed structure for a primitive 
gate. Different from the unilateral structure in previous work [9, 12], 
both the p-type and n-type supply switches (sleep transistors Sp and 
Sn) are allocated for potential uses. It depends on the output value in 
the last state of normal operations.  When OUT=0 (1), Sn (Sp) is still 
turned on and pulls the output through the N- (P-) network. This 
positive feedback loop can hold the output value and provide a 
stronger drive to its down-stream gates in sleeping mode. Since Sp 
(Sn) is turned off, the leakage is highly reduced.

Fig. 4 The basic concept of proposed structure. 
Note that the extra NOR and NAND gates can also be supply-
gated in some cluster without data retention. Additionally, in the 
conceptual figure, the extra NOR and NAND gates result in a high 
overhead for a primitive gate but negligible for a cluster of gates. 
Obviously, a pair of supply switches should be built in for any cluster 
with data retention individually. For instance, a D-flipflop can be bi-
partitioned into 3 shadowed and 2 blank primitive gates as shown in 
Fig. 5. Only a pair of bilateral supply switches will be built in the 
flipflop. No matter what the output value, once the supply is cut off 
instantly, the state can be held. 
CONCLUSIONS  
Power gating using sleep transistors is a trend for power management 
and test scheduling in the deep-submicron and even nanometer reso-
lutions. This paper develop a sleep transistor allocation structure that 
can not only reduce the spike-time product with data retention but 
also balance the noise margins and timing in active mode. A switch-
ing activity based model is developed as a heuristics for sleep transis-
tor clustering. Under the proposed model, the spike reduction can be 
up to 83% in average.

(BICS) [15], n and the threshold current (Ith) are selected 
such that ffthgg I σµσµ 33 −==+ , where gµ and fµ are the 
mean values of Ig and If, while gσ and fσ are their devia-
tions as shown in Fig.1(b). Assume rffgg == µσµσ // , 
we have )31()31( rIrnI onoff −=+ . Finally, n can be easily 
derived to be proportional to switch intensity (SI=Ion/Ioff).  
The SI is thus used to be a metrics of the current resolu-
tion (CR) that is defined as Ig/If  in this paper. 
The basic concept of the IDDS testing for inter-gate 
bridging faults can be illustrated in Fig.2. As Fig.1(a) 
shows, for a conventional CMOS circuit of n primitive 
gates with a resistive bridge Rf, the IDDQ will be about 
nIoff+If in the order of magnitude, where Ioff is the cutoff 
leakage per gate through a p-network Np and an n-
network Nn, which are usually implemented by the low-Vt 
(LT) transistors for performance in an MTCMOS tech-
nology. When the bilateral ideal power switches are ap-
plied to each fine-grain primitive gate as Fig. 1(b) shows, 
all leakages are cut off and thus the faulty current If is 
detected. Obviously, in the ideal situation the SI is infinite 
and all we have to design for current testability is to hold 
on the test patterns.

3. Proposed IDDS Test Scheme 
The proposed IDDS test scheme includes the ASC 
logic design, the clustering structure, and bridging fault 
analysis that are depicted as follows. 
3.1. Adaptive Super-Cutoff Design 
To begin with, in this paper the symbol of an HT gate 
or transistor is marked bold as Fig. 3 shows.

In our previous work for spike reduction, we propose 
an ASC as Fig. 4(a) shows. The P and N networks are 
designed in LT for high speed and gated by a header H 
and a footer F in HT for power management. Feedback 
keeper gates J and K will keep either the header or the 
footer on for data retention. The spike current and wakeup 
time will be highly reduced.

We find that the ASC can be utilized to keeping data

fine grains. A novel ASC is then designed as Fig. 4(b) 
shows. The feedback keeper consists of an HT inverter
