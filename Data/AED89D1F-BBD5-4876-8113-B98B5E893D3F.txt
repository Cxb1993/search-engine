ABSTRACT 
Synthesis, curing behavior, and properties for unsaturated polyester (UP)-montmorillonite 
(MMT) nanocomposites were investigated.  Our objective was to understand the effects of UP 
resin types , types of swelling agents (reactive and non-reactive), and the amount of MMT added on 
the static phase characteristics of the styrene (ST)/UP/MMT system prior to the cure, and on the 
cured sample morphology, curing kinetics, volume shrinkage characteristics, internal pigmentability, 
mechanical properties, and glass transition temperatures in the major continuous 
styrene-crosslinked polyester phase for the ST/UP/MMT ternary systems.

INTRODUCTION 
Adding specific thermoplastic polymers as low profile additives (LPA) in the unsaturated 
polyester resins (UP) can lead to a reduction or even elimination of the polymerization shrinkage 
during the cure1.  By employing non-reactive LPA2, microvoids3 can be generated during the cure, 
which can then compensate for the volume shrinkage.  In contrast, by employing reactive LPA4, 
the intrinsic polymerization shrinkage may be reduced, which is due to the reduction in cyclization 
reaction of UP resin during the cure caused by the favorable intermolecular crosslinking reaction 
between UP and reactive LPA,  In recent years, nanocomposites based on montmorillonite (MMT) 
and UP have been investigated quite extensively5-8.  However, the volume shrinkage for the 
UP-MMT nanocomposites has not been treated.

corresponding value for the organophilic part of the silane-treated MMT can be calculated as 
0.0552 debye/cm3/2).  In general, the higher the polarity difference per unit volume between UP 
and silane-treated MMT, the less compatibility for the ST/UP/silane-treated MMT system at 25oC 
and 110oC prior to reaction.  Hence, at a fixed MMT content, the ST/UP/silane-treated MMT 
system containing the MA-PA-PG type of UP would be theoretically more compatible than that 
containing the MA-PG type of UP.  Also, adding a higher content of silane-treated MMT would 
lead to a less compatibility of the ST/UP/silane-treated ternary system.  This is in agreement with 
the static phase characteristics data for the uncured ST/UP/silane-treated systems at 25oC and at 
110oC (Table 1), where the degree of phase separation, as revealed by the relative weight of lower 
layer solution, was less for the MA-PA-PG systems than the MA-PG systems.  Also, for either the 
MA-PA-PG or the MA-PG systems, the degree of phase separation was higher with a higher 
content of MMT added. 
Data in Table 1 reveal that at a fixed content of MMT, the phase separation rate was faster for 
the MA-PG system than the MA-PA-PG system.  Also, higher MMT content could also lead to a 
faster phase separation rate.  As shown in Table 2, for the St/UP(MA-PA-PG)/10% silane-treated 
MMT systems, after the phase equilibrium, the styrene concentration in the lower layer, which 
would be MMT-rich, was higher than that in the upper layer.  This reveals that the diffusion of 
styrene monomer, which is a small molecule when compared with the UP prepolymer, into the 
gallery of the silane-treated MMT would be easier than that of UP prepolymer, leading to an MR 
higher than 2/1 in the lower layer. 
 
Cured Sample Morphology, and XRD Measurements for MMT Clay and St/UP/MMT 
Nanocomposites 
During the cure at 110oC for St/UP/silane-treated MMT systems, SEM micrographs (not 
shown) show that adding a higher content of MMT would result in a more noticeable two-phase 
cured sample morphology, which consisted of a flake-like continuous phase and an MMT-rich 
dispersed phase.  At a fixed content of MMT, the MA-PG system was less compatible than the 
MA-PA-PG system. 
After the silane treatment for the neat MMT, the interlayer spacing of the MMT was found to be 
increased from 0.95 nm to 1.24 nm, as expected, where the scattering angle, 2θ, was decreased from 
9.3o to 7.1o as measured by XRD.  For the St/UP/silane-treated MMT nanocomposites, no 
conspicuous diffraction peak was detected down to a 2θ of 3.5o as observed from the XRD curves 
(Table 3), which revealed that either an intercalated nanocomposite5 was formed, where the 
interlayer spacing of the MMT during the cure would be larger than 2.52 nm by using the Bragg 
law (i.e. d = λ/(2sinθ), or a exfoliated nanocomposite5 was formed, where the individual MMT 
sheet was just randomly distributed among the UP matrix due to the polymerization force 
destructing the regular structure of the MMT. 
In order to further identify the intercalated and exfoliated nanocomposites, small angle X-ray 
scattering (SAXS) and medium angle X-ray scattering (MAXS) measurements under X-ray 
transmission mode were also performed for the St/UP/silane-treated MMT cured samples.  No 
scattering peaks were found from both SAXS (2θ = 0.07 – 2.2o or d = 115 nm to 3.8nm) and MAXS 
(2θ = 0.22 – 6.7o or d = 38 nm to 1.2nm) measurements, revealing that either an intercalated 
nanocomposite5 was formed, where the interlayer spacing of the MMT during the cure would be 
smaller than 1.2 nm by using the Bragg law (i.e. d = λ/(2sinθ), or a exfoliated nanocomposite5 was 
formed 
TEM micrographs (not shown) for the St/UP/silane-treated MMT nanocomposites showed 
that the formation of a UP-MMT nanocomposite was characterized by a random dispersion of 
intercalated/exfoliated aggregates of clay sheets in the polymer matrix. 
 
Effects of Intrinsic Polymerization on Volume Shrinkage 
 The volume shrinkage of the neat UP resin was 8.1% for the MA-PA-PG system, which was
