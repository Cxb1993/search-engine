mial time algorithm that solves the small-
est bridge-connectivity augmentation prob-
lem on a graph that has partition con-
straints, such as bipartite graph, in O(n(m+
n logn) log n) time, where m is the number of
distinct edges in the input graph. We are un-
aware of any previous results for the smallest
componentwise bridge-connectivity augmen-
tation problem.
Motivation
The related componentwise 2-edge-
connectivity augmentation problem arises
naturally from research on the security of
statistical data [1, 2, 3, 15]. To protect sen-
sitive information in a cross-tabulated table,
it is a common practice to suppress some of
the cells in the table, so that the resulting
table does not leak important or confidential
information. This protection problem can
be reduced to an augmentation problem in
bipartite graphs [6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18].
Figure (a) and Figure (d) illustrate the re-
lationship between our augmentation prob-
lem and the table protection problem. Fig-
ure (d) is a 2-dimensional cross-tabulated ta-
ble with some suppressed cells. In the bipar-
tite suppressed graph constructed from the
table, the vertices correspond to the columns
and rows, and the edges correspond to the
suppressed cells, as shown in Figure (a). It
has been proven [6] that the value of a sup-
pressed cell can be revealed to an adversary
if and only if it is a bridge in the constructed
suppressed graph. Therefore, since there are
three bridges in our suppressed graph, an ad-
versary could infer the values of the three
corresponding cells. For instance, let Ci,j be
the cell at the intersection of row i and col-
umn j, let S∗,j be the sum of the cells in
column j, and let Si,∗ be the sum of the cells
in row i. Then, the value of C1,a must be 1
because it is equal to S1,∗ − C1,b − C1,c. The
value of C5,b is arbitrary. After suppressing
three more cells, namely, C1,c, C2,c, and C3,c,
the values of the suppressed cells cannot be
inferred. This corresponds to the smallest
componentwise 2-edge-connectivity augmen-
tation shown in Figure (c).

We first solve the problem of a smallest
2-edge-connectivity augmentation of bipar-
tite graphs, and then extend the proposed
algorithms to deal with the componentwise
2-edge-connectivity case. To solve the first
problem, we transform the input graph G
into a well-known data structure called a
bridge-block forest. A block of a graph G
is a maximal 2-edge-connected subgraph (or
component) of G. We assume B and W are
the two bipartite sets of vertices in G. A
block that only contains vertices in B (re-
spectively, W ) is called a black (respectively,
white) block, while a block that contains
both vertices in B and W is called a hybrid
block. A vertex in the bridge-block forest
is white if its corresponding block is white.
