一、 中文摘要 
本研究報告主要利用之前計畫中探討過的無網格
法，用以建立線性結構物分析方法。並進一步提出
“區域化牛頓-卡茲高階積分法”，用以改善過去
無網格法在使用點積分時的穩定度，並利用數值算
例證明，所提出的方法可以提高收斂率。在進行模
態分析時，低階積分會因為rank deficiency，導
致“非物理行為模態”之產生，而在高速碰撞的過
程中，非物理模態一但被激發，會導致數值方法之
不穩定，進而影響到解的精度。初步的數值測試結
果中顯示，在無網格法中應用了高階點積分法，能
夠在不增加電腦計算時間(積分點數)的情況下，移
除非物理模態，並且增加數值方法之收斂率。 
1. Abstract 
This report used previous studies of meshless 
methods for linear structures. Furthermore, we 
proposed a localized Newton-Cotes high order nodal 
integration method, which can improve both the 
stability and accuracy of nodal integration under 
meshless framework. The rank deficiency of nodal 
integration leads to non-physical zero-energy modes 
and low energy oscillating modes in modal 
analysis[1]. For high speed impact problems, these 
non-physical modes may lead to unstable numerical 
solutions or even non-physical behavior of the 
structure. The preliminary results show that the 
higher order nodal integration method can remove 
those spurious modes and increase the convergence 
rate without increasing computational effort. 
 
Keywords: Meshless, Newton-Cotes, RKPM, Nodal 
integration 
2. Introduction 
Numerical methods, such as Finite element method 
(FEM), Finite difference method (FDM), Boundary 
element method (BEM), are widely used in the recent 
engineering applications. Those numerical 
approaches can be used to deal with complex 
geometry and different physical phenomenon. 
Among these methods, FEM is a well known 
technique for dealing with problems involving finite 
deformation with material and geometric 
non-linearity. However for large deformation and 
contact problems such as shocks, damage 
fragmentation, FEM will be ineffective due to mesh 
distortions. Some advanced FEM methods allow 
continuous re-meshing during computation [2]. 
However, the solution in the high strain rate region 
still suffers mesh distortion and mesh dependency 
issues. 
The meshless method started from the birth of 
Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method [3, 4] 
in 1977, which was originally used for the modeling 
of astronomical problem.  The general meshless 
method based on Galerkin weak form, such as 
Element Free Galerkin Method (EFG) [5], Meshless 
Local Petrov Galerkin Method (MLPG) [6], and 
Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM), are 
later proposed for general mechanical problems. 
These methods formulate shape functions based on

In Eq.(15), the support domain of ( )a Ix xφ − is 
controlled by a, which is called the support size of 
the kernel function. 
3.2. Numerical Integration 
In this paper, we formulate the governing based the 
Galerkin approximation of the weak form, therefore 
it requires numerical integration for both stiffness 
matrix and force vector. Consider the numerical 
integration of function f (x) is presented as follows

=

where Ω is the integration domain, N is the number 
of integration points, and iw  is weights related to 
each integration point. 
There are several methods for numerical integration, 
and one popular method is called Gauss integration, 
which is widely used in the Finite Element Method 
(FEM) and meshfree methods. However, in Gauss 
integration, the integration points are located based 
on the integration cell (or element) instead of the

In Newton-Cotes method, we use the all discretized 
points to form an approximation function in the 
domain Ω. But now we construct several 
approximation functions in those sub-domain ΩI by 
the points in the support area of node I. Substitute 
those points into Eq. (26) we can get

where i is the number of points in the support area of 
node I. Because the location of ix  may be too small 
to make the T matrix have ill-condition. We map the 
( )I xΩ area into ( ) [ 1,1]ξΩ ∈ − . So Eq.(26) 
becomes

4. Numerical test 
4.1 Convergence analysis 
Convergence rate is an important property for 
numerical approach method. Higher ratio means 
faster convergence to the accurate solution. In other 
words, having a higher convergence rate means we 
can use the less time to get the precision we wanted. 
Consider a Poisson’s equation in the domain
[0,1] [0,1]Ω∈ × , which is presented as

In order to avoid the error occurring on the domain 
boundary we apply essential boundary condition 
instead of natural boundary condition.

order basis and cubic B-spline kernel with 
normalized support size S =2.01 is employed, and the 
solid is discretized by11 11× nodes in the domain, 
which is the same as convergence analysis. Figure 
4-1 is the RKPM with direct nodal integration which 
shows the three zero energy modes which correspond 
to rigid body motion, and it exist several oscillatory 
modes in low energy modes. But in Figure 4-2 the 
oscillation modes are removed by the localized 
Newton-Cotes integration.

integration

5. High speed contact problem 
The Taylor bar impact problem is a general example 
to demonstrate the performance of numerical method 
for high speed impact problems. The geometry of the 
problem is shown in figure 5-1. An aluminum bar is 
hitting a rigid wall with impact velocity 373 m/s. The 
material properties are as follows: Young’s modulus 
E=78.2GPa, Poisson’s Ratio v=0.3, density 2700 
kg/m3. An isotropic hardening plasticity model with 
yield stress 290MPa is employed for the material 
behavior. In this paper, this problem is performed to 
show the oscillation of the solution in the contact 
region due to the instability of nodal integration 
(Figure 5-2). Figure 5-3 and 5-4 shows the agreement 
of the improvement.

6. Conclusions 
The rank deficiency in RKPM with high order basis 
shape function is improved by the localized 
Newton-Cotes integration; it is easy to find that
