Since graph mining is a subfield of data mining 
and graph theory, we also need to introduce the 
fault-tolerant data mining. In this project, we attempt 
to analyze the FT-frequent subgraph mining. In 
addition, there has two related sub-fields: 
(i). Fault-tolerant data mining. 
(ii). Frequent subgraph mining. 
Data mining is the process of discovering 
useful information from large data sets, e.g., pattern 
discovery. Since the real world data often 
accompanied with noise, some items may not match 
exactly with patterns. In this case, allowing data 
contain a few mismatches with patterns is called 
‘fault-tolerance’ (or error-tolerance in some article). 
If data match a pattern with fault-tolerance, we say 
that there is an equivalence relation between those 
data. In Fault-tolerant data mining, data mining 
often means the association rule mining. Association 
rule mining was first investigated in 1993 [2]. And 
mining frequent patterns has been used in 
association rule mining for decades. In this issue, we 
are more concerned about fault tolerance. In recent 
years, many papers have devoted to fault-tolerant 
pattern mining. Such as [14] and [8], both of them 
focus on fixed FT-pattern mining. Besides, [6] 
mainly focuses on proportional fault-tolerant pattern 
mining. Although many papers try to study 
FT-frequent pattern mining, few papers studied 
frequent graph pattern mining. 
In frequent subgraph mining, many algorithms 
have been proposed. FSG [12] is an Apriori-like 
algorithm. gSpan [15] and FFSM [10] are pattern 
growth algorithms, where gSpan is the first 
algorithm for pattern growth method and FFSM uses 
canonical adjacency matrix (CAM) to reduce storage 
space and computational time for isomorphism issue; 
it is more effective than gSpan. SPIN [9] finds 
frequent spanning trees of graph data, and mines 
subgraphs whose spanning trees are isomorphic with 
frequent spanning trees. And then it finds the 
frequent subgraphs from those subgraphs. In [13], 
they study the problem of approximate graph mining 
and proposed MONKEY algorithm. However, in the 
proportional FT-frequent subgraph mining, these 
Apriori-based algorithms may not find optimal 
solution. In addition, path-based algorithms are also 
used to mine frequent subgraphs. After all, they 
mainly reduce the candidate patterns in large 
database. Another example occurs in [1]. Our 
method will use the concept of tree mining. Trees 
are a special case of graphs. Since tree mining has 
less time complexity with graph mining in some 
cases [16], some frequent subgraph mining 
algorithms are based on tree topology, such as SPIN 
[9] and Monkey [13]. 
FT-frequent subgraph mining has many 
possible applications. In social network, exact match 
may not suitable to find role-equivalent actors. Their 
relationship networks are similar, but not necessarily 
identical. Therefore, we can mine role-equivalent 
actors with FT-graph mining. We also can 
recommend people who have similar interests or 
similar friends to become companion. Besides, we 
can analyze interpersonal relationship and predict 
their interests. In bioinformatics, we can classify 
proteins by appropriate equivalence class. In each 
equivalence class, proteins have an equivalence 
relation with a pattern. In chemistry, we can predict 
properties of molecules based on their atom-bond 
structures. 
In this project, we study fault-tolerant graph 
mining problem and propose an algorithm for 
mining fault-tolerant frequent subgraph and a tree 
structure for chemistry application. Also, we will 
discuss possible research directions of fault-tolerant 
graph mining. 
二、結果與討論 
In this project, we study the fault-tolerance 
frequent subgraph mining and propose a simple 
algorithm and a path-tree algorithm to solve this

Figure 1: An illustration of cospectral graphs.
For example in Fig.1, Collatz and Sinogowitz
found the smallest pair of cospectral graph in 1957
[2]. They contain a union graphGX = C4∪K1 and
a star graph GY = S5. The spectra of GX and GY
(by their adjacency matrices) are identical, which
is λX = λY = [2, 0, 0, 0,−2].
From the point of view of geometric relation,
the spectra of adjacency matrices from GX and
GY should not be equal due to their incompatible
topologies. SinceGX andGY are subgraphs ofK5,
it is interesting that (GX ∩K5) ∩ (GY ∩K5) = ∅
but they still contain the same spectrum values.
Therefore, Laplacian matrix is developed to im-
prove the factors of graph relation. It is the diﬀer-
ence of the degree diagonal matrix and the ad-
jacency matrix of G. In this case, the spectra
of GX and GY are λX = [4, 2, 2, 0, 0] and λY =
[5, 1, 1, 1, 0], respectively. Apparently, Laplacian
matrix gives a distinct outcome of its eigenval-
ues. On the contrary, the matrix of D + A is
called the signless Laplacian matrix Q of G. The
spectra of GX and GY are λX = [4, 2, 2, 0, 0] and
λY = [5, 1, 1, 1, 0], respectively. For these two
graphs, the spectra of matrices L and Q are equal.
Although it has been studied that signless
Laplacian matrix spectrum performs better than
other commonly used graph spectra [4], most
surveys were conﬁned to combinatorial, graph-
theoretical analysis, and linear algebra problems.
For the present, seldom exploration in biological
application problems is studied. In addition, one
may notice that there is another matrix, called
the Seidel adjacency matrix S. It is modiﬁed
from adjacency matrix such that each entry si,i
is 0, si,j is -1 if vertices i and j are adjacent,
and si,j is +1 if they do not [15] (see Formula
(3)). Besides, the spectra of Seidel adjacency ma-
trices of Fig.1 are that λX = [3, 2,−1,−2,−3] and
λY = [4,−1,−1,−1,−1].

1, if a(i, j) = 0,

0, if i = j.
(3)
Obviously, the similarity of GX and GY should
be diverse due to their topologies. Therefore, the
diﬀerence of their spectra should also be larger.
Note that in Fig.1, according to Euclidean dis-
tance, the spectra of Seidel adjacency matrices do
not give a better result than Laplacian matrices
or signless Laplacian matrices.
2.2 Graph Cospectrality and Similar-
ity
Graphs with the same spectra are called cospec-
tral or isospectral [3]. It is necessary to examine
the relation between graph cospectra and graph
isomorphism in the following propositions.
Isomorphism → Cospectrality (©) (4)
Cospectrality → Isomorphism (×) (5)
Non-isomorphism → Non-cospectrality (×) (6)
Non-cospectrality → Non-isomorphism (©) (7)
In Proposition (4), do isomorphic graphs imply
cospectral graphs? Of course, it is trivial to ex-
plain from isomorphic graphs. In Fig.2, GU and
GV are isomorphic graphs. Thus, the spectra of
their adjacency matrices are identical, i.e., λU =
λV = [4, 4, 4,−1]. It is also helpful to explain
Proposition (7). As a result, isomorphic graphs
are also cospectral. However, graph cospectral
does not imply graph isomorphism. In Fig.1, GX
and GY are cospectral graphs but they are not iso-
morphic. It supports arguments of Propositions
(5) and (6). In summary, determining cospec-
tral graphs is an easy problem in graph matching

In this experiment, we ﬁnd that spectra of adja-
cency matrix, Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian
matrix, and Seidel adjacency matrix are seldom
diﬀerence. Results show that when Seidel adja-
cency matrix is applied, it gives more accurate re-
latedness of leaf nodes in tree shape. As space
is limited, we only concentrate on the correctness
of spectrum approach and pay scant attention to
matrix comparison.
As illustrated in Fig.3, trees are provided to
expect their accuracy by diﬀerent similarity scor-
ing issues: RMSD, Seidei adjacency matrix spec-
trum, and CATH code. Comparatively, CATH
may cause a better classiﬁcation on protein do-
main and its subunits. Thus, the comparison is
according to the authority of CATH code. Basi-
cally, the selected MHC proteins can be roughly
classiﬁed as the following groups:
  A: A1 {1MY7, 1GYU, 3F04}, A2 {2E5Y},
A3 {2ENG}, A4 {1BXO}
  B: B1 {1OG1, 1OJQ}, B2 {1K5N, 1A6Z}
Let us now look at Fig.3(a) in detail. With the ap-
proach of RMSD, the topological distance is quite
unsatisfactory. It should be noticed that 1BXO,
1OG1, and 1OJQ are unable to estimate their
superimposing structures within selected proteins
by pairwise DALI. The phylogenies in Fig.3(a) are
apt to mislead to wrong assumption. In addition,
protein 1GYU is confused with 1K5N and 1A6Z
in B2, and 2ENG also cannot be calculated in
RMSD. In brief, the performance of RMSD value
is unacceptable in aspect of its principle. As men-
tioned to the proposed spectrum method, 1OG1,
