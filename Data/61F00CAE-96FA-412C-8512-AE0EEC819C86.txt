Abstract- The goal of this project is to develop a stable 
fuzzy sliding mode controller to facilitate robust proper-
ties by using the reaching law method. The proposed 
fuzzy sliding mode controller does not require any 
knowledge of a nonlinear system and attempts to im-
prove both transient and stability margins. By using the 
reaching condition of sliding mode control, the overall 
system with the proposed controller has been proved to 
be uniform ultimate bounded. Simulation results of an 
inverted pendulum confirm that the effect of the fuzzy 
approximation error on the tracking error can be at-
tenuated efficiently by the proposed method.

1. Introduction 
 
Control of nonlinear systems has emerged as an ex-
citing research area because of its widespread applica-
tions. Previous algorithms for solving the highly nonlin-
ear dynamics control problem require accurate mathe-
matical model of the plant dynamics [1, 2]. There are in-
evitable unmodelled nonlinearities and uncertain distur-
bance in their constructed model where conventional 
control strategies cannot be easily derived. 
Fuzzy logic control (FLC) has succeeded in many 
control applications that the conventional control theo-
ries have had difficulties with [3-5]. For complex or 
ill-defined systems that are not amenable to conventional 
control techniques, FLC provides an alternative approach 
for both collecting human knowledge and expertise, and 
dealing with nonlinearities. However, the FLC lacks 
formal synthesis technique and all fuzzy rules have to be 
supplied by human experts. The latest studies consider 
adding some computationally intelligent methods to the 
sliding mode control (SMC) by using the reaching law 
method. Particularly, integrating fuzzy set theory and 
SMC into fuzzy controller design have acquired superior 
performance [6-12]. The fuzzy sliding mode control 
(FSMC) technique retains the positive property of SMC 
but alleviates the chattering, and the fuzzy control rules 
can be determined systematically by the reaching condi-
tion of SMC. The main advantage of FSMC is that the 
control method achieves asymptotic stability of the 
closed-loop system. Thus, FSMC uses fuzzy control to 
construct the system dynamic model or the control while 
the fuzzy control rules and variables are obtained directly 
from the sliding surface equation. 
In this project, we address the problem of control-
ling an unknown nonlinear affined system subject to 
unmodeled dynamics, bounded exogenous disturbances 
and measurement noise. We assume here that the 
nonlinear functions in the system are completely un-
known. The fuzzy rules are constructed in the form of 
“IF situation THEN the control input”. We develop 
FSMC architecture to have some degree of robust prop-
erties and guarantee the output tracking error being able 
to converge to a residual set ultimately. 
 
2. Problem formulation 
Consider a composite nonlinear plant governed by 
 3 
rule base, fuzzy inference engine and defuzzifier [16], as 
shown in Fig.1. The fuzzy system measures the outputs 
of the process and takes control actions on the process 
continuously.

4. Design of the fuzzy sliding mode controller 
The design objective is to develop a control ap-
proach by combining the fuzzy approximator of the sys-
tem with its sliding mode control, resulting in a fuzzy 
sliding mode controller. That is, the fuzzy logic system 
theory is applied to design the sliding mode controller for 
system (1). 
In the design of sliding mode controller, an equiva-
lent control is given first such that each state 
Lyapunov-like condition holds for system stability [14] 
sss ⋅−≤⋅ η&                   (12) 
or alternatively 
η−≤⋅ )sgn(ss&                (13) 
In the following, without loss of generality, we focus 
on second-order system. Hence, from (6) follows 
nnn eecececs ++++== −− 112211 Lce   (14) 
Differentiating (12) with respect to time, then the 
dynamic behavior of the sliding manifold is described by 
the reaching function of the form. Thus, the tracking 
control problem can be formulated by keeping the track-
ing error (5) on the sliding manifold defined as follows

where 0>η  and 0>λ . Therefore the control prob-
lem is to obtain control input u that guarantees the 
reaching condition (16). We construct the fuzzy control 
fuzzu  to guarantee the system’s stability by the 
Lyapunov theory so that the ultimately bounded tracking 
is accomplished. After straightforward manipulation, the 
fuzzy control fuzzyu  is obtained as

6.  Conclusions 
The goal of the work described in this research is the 
development and implementation of fuzzy sliding mode 
control architecture to control an inverted pendulum sys-
tem. The architecture employs a compensator to satisfy 
for sliding mode and forces the output trajectory of the 
inverted pendulum system to follow a prescribed refer-
ence model. When matching with the model occurs, the 
overall control system is equivalent to a stable dynamic 
system, such that the system is to follow the desired tra-
jectory. The overall fuzzy sliding scheme is shown to 
guarantee that the output tracking error can converge to a 
residual set ultimately. Although only the nverted pen-
dulum system has been studied in this paper, the pro-
posed control scheme can also be used to address the 
other class of nonlinear systems.
