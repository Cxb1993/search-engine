一、 摘要
在本計畫中, 我們探討用於非同調檢測的區塊碼, 其中
包含扭轉振幅相位鍵移 (twisted amplitude and phase
shift keying,TAPSK), 和 16個訊號點正交振幅調變
(quadrature-amplitude modulation,QAM)。 首先推
導區塊編碼的扭轉振幅相位鍵移之最小非同調距離, 再
根據此結果, 提出非同調區塊編碼的扭轉振幅相位鍵移
(noncoherent block-coded TAPSK,NBC-TAPSK)。 在
高傳輸速率時, 非同調區塊編碼的扭轉振幅相位鍵移比
2005年提出的非同調區塊編碼的相位鍵移 (noncoherent
block-coded MPSK,NBC-MPSK) 有更大的最小非同調
距離。 接著推導非同調區塊編碼 16QAM 的最小非同調
距離, 再據此提出非同調區塊編碼 16QAM(noncoherent
block-coded 16QAM,NBC-16QAM)。 各種非同調區塊架
構經電腦模擬作比較。 如果碼字長度短時,NBC-16TAPSK
會比其他架構有更好的錯誤效能, 而 NBC-16QAM 會因
為其最小非同調距離太小而錯誤效能不佳。如果碼字長度
相對變長時,NBC-16QAM 會因為最小非同調距離的碼字
個數變稀少而有良好的錯誤效能。

Abstract
In this project, we investigate block-coded modulation
for noncoherent detection, including block-coded
TAPSK (twisted amplitude and phase shift keying)
and block-coded 16QAM (quadrature-amplitude
modulation). The minimum noncoherent distance of
block-coded TAPSK is derived ﬁrst. According to the
derived distance, noncoherent block-coded TAPSK
(NBC-TAPSK) is proposed. At high data rates, NBC-
TAPSK has larger minimum noncoherent distance
than noncoherent block-coded MPSK proposed in
2005. Then the minimum noncoherent distance of
block-coded 16QAM is derived, and noncoherent block-
coded 16QAM (NBC-16QAM) is proposed accordingly.
Various noncoherent block coding schemes are com-
pared via computer simulations. If the block length
is very small, NBC-16TAPSK performs best among
all noncoherent schemes and NBC-16QAM performs
worse due to its small minimum noncoherent distance.
However, if the block is not short, NBC-16QAM has
the best error performance because the codewords with
small noncoherent distances are rare.

二、 緣由與目的
The additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel
which introduces an unknown carrier phase rotation has
been investigated in many works, for example, [1]-[7].
This channel oﬀers a useful abstraction of the ﬂat fading
channel, when the eﬀects of the phase rotation need to
be studied independently of the amplitude variations.
A simple model that is commonly used is one where
the unknown carrier phase is constant over a block of
N symbols, and independent from block to block, [1],
[2]. This model is correct for frequency-hopping sys-
tems. For this noncoherent channel with large N , pilot
symbols used for the carrier phase estimation combined
with codes designed for coherent decoding perform well.
However, for small N , block codes designed for non-
coherent decoding outperform this training-based non-
coherent codes [6], [7]. Noncoherent block codes using
MPSK (M-ary phase shift keying) signals were designed
in [3]–[6]. In [3], the noncoherent distance for MPSK
signals was deﬁned. By designing the parity check ma-
trices for maximizing the minimum noncoherent dis-
tance, block codes for noncoherent detection were pro-
posed in [3],[4].
In [5], the minimum noncoherent distance of block-
coded MPSK was derived, and a new noncoherent block
coding scheme called noncoherent block-coded MPSK
(NBC-MPSK) was proposed. Further results on NBC-
1
If all codewords are of equal energy, the decoder of (4)
and the distance of (5) are the same as the decoder of
(2) and the distance of (3), respectively.
A short description for block-coded modulation is
given as follows. For convenience of presentation,
we restrict the modulation to be 8PSK. Each signal
point in the signal constellation of 8PSK, shown in
Fig. 1(a), is labeled by (a, b, c) where a, b, and c ∈
{0, 1}. By successive two-way partitions of 8PSK sig-
nal set, the intra-subset squared Euclidean distances
are δ2a = 2 −
√
2, δ2b = 2 and δ
2
c = 4 respectively [10].
Let (a1, b1, c1), (a2, b2, c2), · · · , (aN , bN , cN) be a block
of transmitted signals with length N . A multilevel
block-coded 8PSK C is designed in such a manner that
ca = (a1, a2, · · · , aN) is a codeword of a binary block
code Ca, cb = (b1, b2, · · · , bN) is a codeword of a binary
block code Cb and cc = (c1, c2, · · · , cN) is a codeword of
a binary block code Cc. Herein, Ci represents the com-
ponent code used for coding level i, where i ∈ {a, b, c}.
In this report, all component codes of block-coded mod-
ulation are linear. The transmitted codeword of C com-
posed of ca, cb and cc is x = exp{j π4 (ca + 2cb + 4cc)}.
For i ∈ {a, b, c}, the minimum noncoherent Ham-
ming distance of Ci, denoted by dncH,i, is deﬁned by
dncH,i = min{di,min, N − di,max} [5], where di,min and
di,max denote the minimum and maximum values of
Hamming distance between any two codewords corre-
sponding to diﬀerent information bits in Ci, respec-
tively. In [5], the minimum squared noncoherent dis-
tance of block-coded 8PSK C using linear component
codes is shown to be
d2nc = min
{
d2nc,a, d
2
nc,b, d
2
nc,c
}
(6)
where d2nc,a = N−

d2ncH,a
2
, d2nc,b =
N −
√
(N − dncH,b)2 + d2ncH,b and d2nc,c = 2dncH,c.
Noncoherent block-coded MPSK proposed in [5] is
illustrated as follows. Assume that C ′i is an (N, ki +
1, di,min) binary linear block code with a generator ma-
trix containing an all-one row. The generator matrix
of C ′i can be represented as G
′
i =
(
1
Gi
)
where 1
is an all-one 1 × N matrix and Gi is a ki × N ma-
trix. Let Ci denote the (N, ki, di,min) code deﬁned by
the generator matrix Gi for i ∈ {a, b, c}. Note that
C ′i = {Ci, Ci ⊕ 1} and dncH,i of Ci is equal to di,min
∀i ∈ {a, b, c}. Noncoherent block-coded MPSK C is
deﬁned as block-coded MPSK whose component codes
for coding level a, b and c are Ca, Cb and Cc re-
spectively. When N → ∞, NBC-MPSK has d2nc =
min{((2−√2)/2)da,min, db,min, 2dc,min}, which is equiva-
lent to the minimum squared Euclidean distance (mul-
tiplied by 1/2) of coherent block-coded MPSK.
B．Noncoherent Block-Coded TAPSK
Using Linear Component Codes
We ﬁrst derive the minimum noncoherent distance of
block-coded generalized-8TAPSK using linear compo-
nent codes whose constellation is presented in Fig. 1(b)
with 0 ≤ φ ≤ π
4
.
Theorem 1: Deﬁne f(d) by
f(d) = r20N +
r21 − r20
2
d−
√
(r20(N − d) + r0r1d cosφ)2 + (r0r1d sinφ)2.
For block-coded generalized-8TAPSK C whose compo-
nent codes are all linear, the minimum squared nonco-
herent distance is
d2nc = min
{
d2nc,a, d
2
nc,b, d
2
nc,c
}
(7)
where d2nc,a = min{f(da,min), f(da,max)},
d2nc,b = r
2
0
(
N −
√
(N − dncH,b)2 + d2ncH,b
)
and
d2nc,c = 2r
2
0dncH,c.
Proof: Assume that x1,x2 ∈ C and x1 
= x2. Sup-
pose that x1 is composed of ca, cb and cc, and x2 is
composed of c′a, c
′
b and c
′
c. Consider the following con-
ditions.
(i) Suppose that ca 
= c′a. Let dH(ca, c′a) be d. As-
sume that among the same N − d bits, there are p
bits equal to 1 and N − d − p bits equal to 0. Con-
sequently, we have ca = (1 · · ·1︸ ︷︷ ︸
p
0 · · ·0︸ ︷︷ ︸
N−d−p
1 · · ·10 · · ·0︸ ︷︷ ︸
d
) and
c′a = (1 · · ·1︸ ︷︷ ︸
p
0 · · ·0︸ ︷︷ ︸
N−d−p
0 · · · 01 · · ·1︸ ︷︷ ︸
d
).
It can be shown that
‖x1‖2 + ‖x2‖2
2
= (r21 − r20)p + r20N +
r21 − r20
2
d
and
|(x1,x2)| ≤
√
((r21 − r20)p + r20(N − d) + r0r1d cosφ)2 + (r0r1d sinφ)2.
When, for example, cb = cc = c
′
b = c
′
c = 0, the equal-
ity holds. According to the above two equations, it
can be shown that min
ca,c
′
a∈Ca
dH(ca,c′a)=d
d2nc(x1,x2) occurs when
3
When N →∞, we have
d2nc = min
{
(r21 + r

0 −
√
2r0r1)
2
da,min, r

}
(11)
which is equivalent to the minimum squared Euclidean
distance (multiplied by 1/2) of block-coded 8TAPSK
with the same labeling. The minimum squared non-
coherent distance for NBC-16TAPSK can be obtained
similarly.
The following are examples of NBC-8TAPSK. Ex-
amples of NBC-8PSK with the same data rate are also
given.
Example 1: For NBC-8TAPSK, let Ca, C
′
b and C
′
c all
be the (N,N, 1) code. The data rate is (3N − 2)/N
bits/symbol, which is higher than the data rates of all
codes of NBC-8PSK.
Example 2: For NBC-8TAPSK, let Ca be the (N,N−
1, 2) code, and C ′b and C
′
c both be the (N,N, 1) code.
For NBC-8PSK, let Ca, C
′
b and C
′
c all be the (N,N, 1)
code. The data rate is (3N − 3)/N bits/symbol.
Example 3: For NBC-8TAPSK, let Ca and C
′
b both
be the (N,N−1, 2) code, and C ′c be the (N,N, 1) code.
For NBC-8PSK, let C ′a be the (N,N − 1, 2) code, and
C ′b and C
′
c both be the (N,N, 1) code. The data rate is
(3N − 4)/N bits/symbol.
Example 4: For NBC-8TAPSK, let Ca be the (N,N−
1 − log2 N, 4) Reed-Muller (RM) code, and C ′b and C ′c
both be the (N,N, 1) code. For NBC-8PSK, let C ′a be
the (N,N − 1− log2 N, 4) RM code, C ′b be the (N,N −
1, 2) code, and C ′c be the (N,N, 1) code. The data rate
is (3N − 4− log2 N)/N bits/symbol.
For codes of NBC-8TAPSK, the value of r should
be chosen for maximizing dnc. The minimum non-
coherent distances of nonlinear NBC-TAPSK codes
in [7] are found by computers. Because the com-
plexity grows exponentially with N , only codes
with N ≤ 8 are considered in [7]. But for codes
of the proposed NBC-TAPSK with arbitrary N ,
the minimum noncoherent distance can be easily
obtained according to the equation. In the above
examples, db,min is not larger than 2dc,min so d
2
nc =
min
{
f(da,min), r
2
0
(
N −
√
(N − db,min)2 + d2b,min
)}
.
When r increases, f(da,min) increases and
r20
(
N −
√
(N − db,min)2 + d2b,min
)
decreases. It
is not easy to solve the equation f(da,min) =
r20
(
N −
√
(N − db,min)2 + d2b,min
)
for the optimal
value of r. Therefore, we use computers to ﬁnd the
best values of r. The procedure is illustrated as follows.
Step 1 Set r = 1.01.
Step 2 Is f(da,min) smaller than
r20
(
N −
√
(N − db,min)2 + d2b,min
)
? If the an-
swer is “no”, store the value of d2nc, denoted by
d′2nc, and jump to Step 4.
Step 3 Add 0.01 to r. Return to Step 2.
Step 4 Subtract 0.01 from r, and compute the corre-
sponding d2nc. Is d
2
nc smaller than d
′2
nc? If the answer
is “yes”, let d2nc be equal to d
′2
nc and add 0.01 to r.
Table I lists the minimum noncoherent distance of
Examples 1-4 for N = 4, 8, 16, 32 and N → ∞. The
corresponding values of r are given in the parentheses.
It can be observed that for the same rate and N , NBC-
8TAPSK always has larger dnc than NBC-8PSK. Fur-
thermore, NBC-8TAPSK with rate 3N−2
N
has larger dnc
than NBC-8PSK with rate 3N−3
N
, and NBC-8TAPSK
with rate 3N−3
N
still has larger dnc than NBC-8PSK with
rate 3N−4
N
.
C．Noncoherent Block-Coded 16QAM
In the 16QAM constellation shown in Fig. 1(d), the dis-
tance between the smallest-energy point and the origin
is denoted by z. The value of z is decided according
to the energy normalization, which is 1/
√
5 if all points
are of equal probability. The minimum noncoherent dis-
tance of block-coded 16QAM is derived in the following
theorem. With a similar procedure, the minimum non-
coherent distance of block-coded QAM with more signal
points can also be derived. The proof can be found in
[11].
Theorem 2: Deﬁne gc(d), g
′
c(d) and gd(d) by gc(d) =
5N − 2d − √(3N − 2d)2 + (4N − 2d)2, g′c(d) = N +
6d − √(N + 2d)2 + (6d)2 and gd(d) = N + 4d −√
(N − 4d)2 + (4d)2, respectively. For block-coded
16QAM C whose component codes are all linear codes,
the minimum squared noncoherent distance is
d2nc = min
{
d2nc,a, d
2
nc,b, d
2
nc,c, d
2
nc,d
}
(12)
where
d2nc,a = z

5N −

(3N + dncH,a)2 + (4N − dncH,a)2
)
d2nc,b = z

√
(3N)2 + (4N + 2dncH,b)2
)
d2nc,c = z
2 min{gc(dc,min), g′c(dc,max)} and d2nc,d =
z2 min{gd(dd,min), gd(dd,max)}.

codewords with diﬀerent noncoherent distances for the
noncoherent multistage decoding algorithm in [5], [6].
We consider Example 5 of NBC-16QAM in which there
are totally 24N−3 codewords. Figure 3 shows the aver-
age number of codewords with small noncoherent dis-
tances in decoding stage a for N = 3, 4 and 5. It can
be observed that the average number decreases as N
increases for d2nc < 0.13. Simulation results in the next
section will conﬁrm that the average number of code-
words with small noncoherent distances decreases as N
increases.
D．Simulation Results and Discussions
At the receivers, the channel-quantization decoding al-
gorithm in [6, Sec. III] is used. This algorithm uses the
estimate of θ from the family Θ = {0, 2π
MQ
, · · · , 2π(Q−1)
MQ
},
where M = 4 for NBC-8TAPSK and NBC-16QAM,
M = 8 for NBC-8PSK and NBC-16TAPSK. In all sim-
ulations, we set Q = 6. Note that the labeling in
Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) is Ungerboeck labeling, but if C ′b
and C ′c are uncoded bits (db,min = dc,min = 1), the label-
ing of bits b and c should be Gray labeling of QPSK for
the minimization of bit error rate (BER). The labeling
in Fig. 1(c) is similar. For NBC-TAPSK and nonlinear
NBC-TAPSK, we use the value of r that needs the low-
est SNR at the BER of 10−6 according to simulation
results.
We ﬁrst compare various noncoherent block codes
using eight or sixteen signal points with data rate
(3N − 3)/N bits/symbol for N = 16. Figure 4 shows

Component codes of NBC-8TAPSK using C
(L)
a (de-
noted by NBC-8TAPSK(L)) and NBC-8TAPSK using
C
(H)
a (denoted by NBC-8TAPSK(H)) are the same as
NBC-8PSK. The used values of r are 1.94, 1.95 and
1.6 for NBC-8TAPSK(H), NBC-8TAPSK(L) and NBC-
8TAPSK, respectively. We ﬁnd that NBC-8PSK is the
worst, and NBC-8TAPSK has better BER than NBC-
8TAPSK(L) and NBC-8TAPSK(H). NBC-8TAPSK us-
ing C
(O)
a has almost the same BER as NBC-8TAPSK
and thus is not shown in the ﬁgure. At high SNRs,
NBC-16TAPSK outperforms NBC-8TAPSK. This is
reasonable since its d2nc is 0.6277 (shown in Table II),
which is larger than d2nc of NBC-8TAPSK, 0.6030
(shown in Table I). After all, NBC-16QAM whose d2nc
is only 0.1649 is the best. It provides about 1.6dB gain
over NBC-16TAPSK at a BER of 10−6.
For NBC-16TAPSK, Table III compares the value of
r that needs the lowest SNR at the BER of 10−6 in
simulations of r with the theoretical best values of r.
In the multistage decoding, decoding errors in level a
probably causes error propagation, so slightly larger r
which results in better BER in level a would have the
best overall BER. Let Na and Nb denote the numbers of
the nearest-neighbor codewords for Ca and Cb, respec-
tively, shown in Table III also. We ﬁnd that if Na
Nb
is less
than or approximately equal to 1, the values of r which
result in the best error BER in simulations are close
to (slightly larger than) the values of r which result in
the largest dnc in Table II. But if
Na
Nb
is not small, the

五、 結果自評
Block-coded modulation using MPSK signals for non-
coherent detection was well studied before. In this
project, we complete block-coded modulation schemes
for noncoherent detection. The minimum noncoherent
distances of block-coded TAPSK and 16QAM are de-
rived. The minimum noncoherent distance of block-
coded QAM with more signal points can be derived
similarly. According to the derived distances, we pro-
pose NBC-TAPSK and NBC-16QAM. The comparison
of minimum noncoherent distances shows the superi-
ority of NBC-TAPSK over NBC-MPSK at high data
rates. We compare various noncoherent block codes
based on the simulation results. If the block is very
short, for example N = 4, NBC-16QAM has worse er-
ror performance due to its small minimum noncoherent
distance, and NBC-16QTAPSK has the best error per-
formance. But if the block length is not small, NBC-
16QAM has the best error performance because the
codewords with small noncoherent distances becomes
rare.
