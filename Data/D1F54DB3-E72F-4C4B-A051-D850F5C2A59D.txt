2INTRODUCTION
Several epidemiological studies1-3 conducted in different countries have reported that
particulate mater (PM) with aerodynamic diameter smaler than 10μm (PM10), especially the finer
particle fraction of PM10, such as PM2.5 (smaler than 2.5μm) and PM1 (smaler than 1μm), can 
penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and therefore have negative impact on human health
condition such as increase in mortality1 and asthma2. These findings attract more attention to the
investigation of transport behavior of PM. Moreover, people nowadays spend a significant amount
of their time in the indoor environment such as homes, offices, and transport vehicles. The provision
of low indoor PM levels in these indoor environments is thus crucial. However, in many large Asia
cities, such as Taipei, Tokyo and Hong Kong, due to the living habits and cooking style, indoor PM10
and PM2.5 levels have been found to be about 2 to 4 times higher than those in the homes in western
countries.4 As a result, there is a high demand in Asia for researching indoor air cleaning procedure
against PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.
Natural or mechanical ventilation has played an essential role in diluting and removing
pollutants emitted by indoor sources. Ventilation is an air mass transfer process by which clean
outdoor air is brought to an indoor space and stale air is removed.5 This clean outdoor air is either
mixed with the air already present in the indoor space to give mixing or dilution ventilation, or is
used to displace air in the indoor space to provide displacement or piston-flow ventilation. The
above different ventilation patterns can provide different removal mechanisms of indoor PM. Thus,
these ventilation patterns give characteristically different PM10/PM2.5/PM1 removal ability and result
in different PM suspension profiles. To minimize exposure to indoor PM, studies on investigating
the effect of different ventilation patterns on PM10, PM 2.5 and PM1 removal are necessary.
Academic studies regarding PM transport in indoor environment have been mostly carried out
by experimental measurement.6-10 Generally, these experiments can provide useful knowledge of
airflow and PM transport behavior on the sample points for given experimental configurations.
However, it is very difficult to simultaneously measure temporal and spatial information on airflow
velocity distribution, PM size and concentration distribution in the entire building for any specific
physical configurations. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solutions are thus more adequate and
convenient for analyzing airflow patterns and PM concentrations inside of a building, because
building configurations can be numerically made and modified as required within a short time.5
Most previous CFD works5, 11-12 on indoor PM transport are mainly based on the Eulerian
advection-diffusion approach which takes less computing resources. This approach, neglecting the
particulate nature of indoor particles, is only adequate for simulating gaseous pollutants or small,

the instantaneous velocities iu according to

components of the filtered velocities. Besides, the LES is primarily valid for turbulent core flows
(i.e., the flow in the regions somewhat far from walls).21 To deal with boundary layer flows in
partitioned environment, the wall function model near the solid boundary25 and the non-slip
boundary on the wall are adopted.
Lagrangian Particle Tracking Model
For the purpose of investigating the transport behaviors of PM10/PM2.5/PM1, the PM size that
we focus on is particle aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10μm. Under such a particle size range, 
time series of instantaneous particle positions can be obtained by numerical integration of the
following three-dimensional differential equations, which include the gravitational force, FG, the
drag force, FD, the Saffman lift force, FS, and the Brownian motion force, FB.26

6Grid Convergence Analysis
Since computing resources are limited, the mesh size of the finite volume cells in the present
study cannot be set to be zero. Numerical discretization errors are inevitable. It is important therefore,
before the model validation, to understand the magnitude of numerical discretization errors and
ensure that a sufficiently fine grid is used to reduce the error to an acceptable value. To demonstrate
the grid convergence in the present study, four grid resolution tests (the numbers of non-uniform
finite-volume cells are 10,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 200,000, respectively) are used to simulate the
airflow field of the two-zone building in Fig.1 with 9.22 hr-1. Figure 2 displays the dimensionless
time-averaged velocities along the vertical centerlines of Zone I and Zone II. The results show that
the solution is convergent when the grid numbers are greater than 100,000. Therefore, the present
study selects 100,000 grid cells as the numerical basis of the indoor airflow computation.
Particle Sensitivity Analysis and Model Validation
In the Lagrangian particle tracking process, the particle number or mass concentrations are
generally derived from statistical analysis of the trajectories of the particles. The accuracy of using
Lagrangian particle tracking method depends on the release of statistically significant sample of
particles. As a consequence, sensitivity analysis on the size of the particle sampling is performed in
the next step. Lu et al.15 only used 800 particles in their simulation. In the present study, under the
aforementioned 100,000 grid cells, three particle sample sizes (the numbers of sample particles are
800, 2,400, and 6,000) are used to simulate the temporal distributions of indoor mass concentration
in the two-zone building. The initial positions of particles are uniformly distributed in Zone I, with a
sum of 800, 2,400, and 6,000 particle tracks, respectively. The total particle mass injected in Zone I
is specified according to the experimental data, and the particle mass is uniformly carried by each
size group (see Tables 1 and 2 for details).
The numerical particle mass concentrations (C) in each zone at each tracking minute can be
determined by using
V
M
C S (5)
where MS is the total mass of suspended particles, and V denotes the volume of the zone.
Comparisons of the PM mass concentrations in both zones between the numerical simulations and
the full-size experiments are shown in Fig. 3. The results show that some discrepancies exist
between the case releasing 800 particles. Good agreement of the temporal concentration
distributions between the simulated and measured data in each zone can be found for the cases
releasing 2,400 and 6,000 sample particles. The relative difference in the simulated results between
8dust monitor (Series 1100, Grimm Labortechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Ainring, Germany). The PM10
profile folows a lognormal distribution with a geometric mean diameter of 1.09 μm and a geometric 
standard deviation of 1.27. In the profile, the PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 mass concentrations are 48.00
μgm-3, 24.28 μgm-3, and 13.94 μgm-3, respectively. This profile is divided into ten size groups in
terms of aerodynamic diameters ranging from 0.5μm to 10μm (see Table 3). In each size group, the 
PM concentration is assumed to be a constant.
Numerical scenario simulations of the three ventilation patterns having 5 hr-1 air change rate
with the above PM10 profile as the initial condition are carried out. At the beginning of particle
release, particles are distributed uniformly in both Zone I and Zone II. Particles move after clean
outdoor air flowing into the building, resulting in redistribution of the PM concentration. The PM
concentration is calculated from the simulated results of ensemble-averaged particle trajectories.
Three widely used particle size indexes of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 are determined by numerically
integrating the appropriately weighted moment of the ten respective particle size groups in Table 3.
In the LES approach, the smallest mesh used herein is 0.05m, which is near the wall region and
is only one order higher than the Kolmogorov length scale. After carrying out the LES for several
flow-through times to ensure that the final time-averaged results are independent of the initial
conditions, the time-averaged velocities and turbulent statistics are collected over 150 seconds with
a temporal resolution of Δt = 0.003 sec. For the Lagrangian particle tracking process, the time step
that we use is one order smaller than the relaxation time of particles to ensure the numerical accuracy.
600 ensembles are undertaken to obtain the ensemble-averaged trajectories for each sample particle
at each time step.24
RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Indoor Airflow Pattern
By means of the LES procedure and turbulent statistics, the instantaneous and time-average
airflow velocities of the 100,000 non-uniform grids are determined. The simulated results of the
time-average airflow field at the centerline plane for the three ventilation patterns are shown in Fig. 5.
It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the location of the inlet and outlet openings has significant impact on
indoor airflow pattern and ventilation effectiveness inside of the building. In the case of piston
displacement ventilation (Fig. 5a), a strong incoming jet from the windward side moves
straightforwardly through the interior opening and finally flows towards the leeward side just like a
piston flow. Between the incoming jet and the ceiling, two large but weak counterclockwisely
circulating eddies located in both zones, cannot bring too much outdoor air. The airflow velocities in
10
The rest of the building space is poorly ventilated, resulting in poor PM removal. Due to the small
ventilated areas, all of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 mass concentrations in Zone I and Zone II are slowly
decreased compared to the other two ventilation patterns. For mixing ventilation, due to its short-cut
effect caused by the geometric arrangement of the openings, PM10 PM2.5, and PM1 mass
concentrations in Zone I can be effectively reduced to about 86%, 79% and 72%, respectively, of the
initial concentrations after the 30th minute of the particle tracking time. However, PM levels in Zone
II are not accessible to be lowered down, because Zone II is single-sidedly ventilated with high
pressure inside, in which particles are not easy in and out.
PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 Removal Efficiency
Based on the simulated results in Fig. 6, PM levels are spatially averaged for the entire building
to obtain the building-averaged removal efficiencies of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 at the 30th minute of
the tracking time. The removal efficiencies of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1 for piston displacement, mixing,
and cross-flow displacement ventilations are (62%, 35%, 31%), (70%, 59%, 50%) and (85%, 72%,
64%), respectively. Among the three ventilation patterns, cross-flow displacement ventilation is
considered as the most effective way to remove PM10, PM2.5, and PM1. The reason is that cross flow
provides a wider range of ventilated area to transport and remove indoor particles than the other
ventilation patterns.
The above results also reveal that coarse particles (>2.5μm) are easier to be removed from the
building than fine particles (<2.5μm). This can be explained that coarse particles can maintain their
velocities for longer time duration due to larger inertia and relaxation time. This phenomenon
together with their stronger gravitational settling causes coarse particles to move easily from one
circulation region to another. Contrarily, PM2.5 and PM1 are easily trapped in eddies indoors because
fine particles have smaller inertia and relaxation time. Thus, fine particles are easily influenced by
the surrounding complex indoor airflows in partitioned environment such as different length-scale
vortex structures, entry jets, and circulating flows, which can be clearly seen in the present study.
Particulate Matter Removal Mechanism
Indoor polluted particles are redistributed after clean outdoor air flowing into the building.
During the redistribution process, particles would suspend in the air, migrate to other zones, settle
down to floors, inertially impact or intercept on walls or ceilings, or escape out of the building,
which can be all thoroughly simulated by the present model. The above particle transport
mechanisms are usually classified into four parts, i.e., suspension, migration (carried to the
neighboring zone by airflow), deposition and escape.24,27 Deposition and escape are regarded as
12
PM1 and PM2.5 would penetrate deep into the respiratory tract and have negative impact on indoor
occupants. One would expect that it is not enough to use PM10 level as the only indoor PM index.
Thus, from the purpose of health protective for indoor occupants, indoor PM2.5 and PM1 levels
should be also considered. Finally, it is important to note that, due to the measurement limitation of
the portable laser dust monitor herein used, the present study considers diameter ranging only from
0.5μm to 10μm. In Table 3, there is only one size group for particle diameter smaler than 1μm, 
which limits the investigation of the temporal variation of fine particles. Further study on the
transport behavior of fine and ultra fine particles is needed.
CONCLUSIONS
A series of numerical scenario simulations on the effect of ventilation pattern on indoor PM
removal efficiency in partitioned environment is conducted. Based on the simulated results, the
present research has led to the following conclusions:
1. The present numerical model provides a convenient and useful tool to investigate indoor airflow
patterns and PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 transport behaviors in a partitioned building.
2. Though the ventilation rate of the building is the same, the location of the inlet and outlet
openings has significant impact on ventilation effectiveness and PM removal efficiency inside of
the building. Among the three ventilation patterns, cross-flow displacement ventilation provides
wider ventilated areas than the other ventilation patterns. It is considered as the most effective
way to remove all of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.
3. For the three ventilation patterns, PM10 are much easier to be removed than finer particles like
PM2.5, and PM1. However, getting rid of coarse particles cannot guarantee healthy indoor
environment, because the remaining high levels of PM1 and PM2.5 would penetrate deep into the
respiratory tract and have negative impact on indoor occupants. From the purpose of health
protective for indoor occupants, it is not enough to only use PM10 level as the indoor PM index.
Indoor PM2.5 and PM1 levels should be also considered.
4. Displacement ventilation would result in more escaped particles and less deposited particles than
mixing ventilation.
5. Particle transport is size-dependent and is mainly affected by indoor airflow pattern and particle
physical properties. A ventilation pattern having higher particle removal efficiency would result
in a swifter shift of the particle size distribution towards smaller size and less deviation.
