Abstract 
 
A novel acoustic impedance matching layer system consisted of a lead zirconate 
titanate (PZT) piezoelectric layer has been developed for medical ultrasonic 
transducer applications. The PZT matching layer is capable of redistributing the 
frequency spectrum of a broadband ultrasonic transducer, acting as a frequency filter 
without reducing the wave amplitude. These interesting behaviors are contributed to 
the electromechanical properties of the piezoelectric layer and are investigated in the 
present study with pulser-receiver ultrasound experiments using PZT matching thin 
discs of different electromechanical properties and polarization conditions.

1. Introduction 
 
From the view point of materials science, the most important component in a 
medical ultrasonic transducer is the vibrating piezoelectric element. The acoustic 
impedance of the piezoelectric element is typically much higher than those of internal 
human tissues and organs. This large mismatch in acoustic impedance makes the 
transmitted ultrasonic waves dissipating most of their energies at the device-human 
interface, reducing the overall output efficiency of a medical ultrasonic transducer. 
Polymers and metal-polymer composites with optimal impedance values for acoustic 
matching purposes have been developed for ultrasonic transducer applications [1-10]. 
The goal of the present study is to investigate the acoustic matching properties of a 
novel acoustic matching layer system, which is designed to actively manipulate the 
output waveforms of broadband ultrasonic transducers. This novel acoustic matching 
layer system is consisted of a PZT layer. 
 
2. Experimental procedure 
 
To examine the frequency filtering characteristics of a PZT acoustic matching 
layer, commercially available PZT thin discs were purchased (Eleceram Technology 
Co., Taiwan). Three different polarization conditions of PZT discs were specifically 
ordered; they were: poled, unpoled and poled but short-circuited. Additionally, four 
different resonant frequencies, 1, 2, 3 and 5 MHz, were ordered for each PZT disc 
type (note: different resonant frequencies mean different thicknesses). In order to 
measure the frequency spectrum and output sound pressure of an ultrasonic transducer, 
an external hydrophone (ONDA Co., Taiwan) was used to receive the output acoustic

4. Conclusion 
 
The novel PZT acoustic matching layer system developed in the present study is 
capable of redistributing the frequency spectrums of commercial broadband ultrasonic 
transducers. Not only it could bridge the mismatch in acoustic impedance, if coupled 
with polymer layers, it could also act as a frequency filter and manipulate the output 
waveform of the transducer. The filtering behavior depends strongly on the thickness 
resonant mode of the PZT layer. When the poled PZT layer is short-circuited, the 
filtered frequency peaks in the output spectrum become sharper, indicating a higher 
mechanical quality. The novel PZT acoustic matching layer system can be designed to 
be detachable so that one broadband ultrasonic transducer could potentially produce 
different frequency spectrums depending on the type of PZT matching layer adopted.

ABSTRACT 
Large strain actuation in (001)-oriented barium titanate 
(BaTiO3) single crystals subjected to combined uniaxial stress 
and electric field is examined.  The hysteresis evolution of the 
crystal under combined electromechanical loading reveals 
incomplete switching characteristics and a considerable 
disproportion of slope gradients at zero electric field for the 
measured polarization and strain hysteresis curves.  A likely 
cause for the disproportion of slope gradients is the cooperative 
operation of multiple 90° switching systems by which 
“polarization-free” strain changes are induced.  An in-situ 
domain observation study reveals the formation of bubble-like 
micro-domains prior to the macroscopic 90° switching of the 
crystal bulk.  The presence of these bubble-like “switching 
weak points” indicates that regions within the crystal do not 
necessarily switch 90° at the same time, and hence, in a way, 
supports the existence of multiple 90° switching systems.  The 
hysteresis evolution of the crystal is investigated again at 55 °C 
under identical electromechanical loading conditions.  At a 
temperature higher than room temperature, the degree of 
discrepancy between the slope gradients at zero electric field 
for the measured polarization and strain hysteresis curves is 
significantly reduced.  This is due to the increase in domain 
wall mobility, lowering the extent of incomplete switching at 
maximum electric field. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Single crystal ferroelectrics have received extensive 
attentions recently due to their ability to provide a high degree 
of polarization domain alignment with electrical poling, which 
could in turn give rise to superb piezoelectric characteristics.  
Various attempts have been carried out to develop large strain 
actuation in ferroelectric single crystals either via composition 
development or via domain switching [1-4].  Park and Shrout 
[1] introduced a single crystal relaxor ferroelectric PZN-PT (a 
solid solution of lead zirconate niobate and lead titanate) which 
possesses an electrostrictive strain up to 1.7% with very little 
hysteresis.  Ren [2] showed that the symmetry conforming 
property of point defects can give rise to large reversible 
electrostrains (up to 0.75%) in thermally aged barium titanate 
(BaTiO3) single crystals.  Burcsu et al. [3] examined the 90°-
switching-induced strain of BaTiO3 single crystals under 
electromechanical loadings, and observed nearly 0.8% strain at 
1.78 MPa compressive stress together with 1 MVm-1 electric 
field.  Large strain changes in ferroelectric crystals caused by 
domain switching are typically induced through angles other 
than 180° [5,6].  It is therefore essential to investigate factors 
which might influence the effective operation of non-180° 
switchings [7].  By doing so, the achievable strain by an 
electrical, mechanical, or electromechanical loading could 
potentially be gauged accurately.  In the present study, the 
straining and switching characteristics of BaTiO3 single 
crystals are investigated.  This is achieved through examining 
their hystereses in the electric polarization (P) vs. electric field 
(E) and strain (ε) vs. electric field (E) responses.  The effect of 
constant bias stress on the hysteresis behavior is also examined.  
From the hysteresis measurements, the correlation between the 
rate of change of polarization with respect to electric field and 
the rate of change of strain with respect to electric field is 
studied to get a picture of the competition between different 
switching systems. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
A series of polarization and strain hysteresis measurements 
under combined uniaxial electrical and mechanical loadings 
were performed on unpoled (001)-oriented cuboidal BaTiO3 
single crystals measuring 5 × 5 × 2 mm3.  The crystals were 
obtained from MTI Co., CA, USA.  Conductive silver paints 
were used to produce electrodes on the 5 × 5 mm2 surfaces.  A 
loading fixture shown in Fig. 1 was developed for the 
simultaneous application of uniaxial compressive stress and 
electric field.  The loading fixture consisted of brass plates, 
providing electrical contact to the electrode surfaces of the 
crystal, and nylon spacers to insulate the crystal from the 
mechanical load frame.  The upper brass plate was connected 
to ground via a ferroelectric analyzer (Model TF2000,

ferroelectrics.  It is evident from Fig. 2a that as the 
compressive stress is increased above 1.7 MPa, the corners of 
the P-E hysteresis become rounded, both the saturation and 
remanent polarizations start to decrease, and switching is 
completed over a wider range of electric field.  The measured 
Pr value at 4.0 MPa is approximately 15% smaller than the Pr 
value at zero stress.

A simple calculation is conducted to verify the above 
argument.  Let 1C  and 2C  denote, respectively, the volume 
fraction of out- plane domains oriented in a direction 
identical to the applied electric field and in a direction parallel 
but opposite to the applied electric field.  The volume fraction 
of in-plane domains is therefore equal to )1( 21 CC

the crystal tested in the present study exhibits a polarization 
value of 23.5 µCcm-2 (see Fig. 2a) which is about 90% of the 
theoretical maximum value.  At this stage of loading, if only 
out-of-plane 180° domains exist in the crystal, the relationships 
between  and  can be stated as 1C 2C 121 =+CC  and

domains when the applied electric field decreases from 
maximum to zero at constant compressive stress; it can then be 
worked out that the 90° switching of this “cooperative pair” 
gives rise to zero change in , while a change of magnitude

operation.  This estimation is in good agreement with the 
experimental data which show a 9.5% difference (see Table 1).

In order to understand how m
ht be present within the BaTiO3 single crystal, an in-situ 
domain observation study, in which a poled (001)-oriented 
BaTiO3 single crystal measuring 5 × 5 × 2 mm3 is loaded by a 
unipolar electric field perpendicular to its poling direction, is 
carried out.  The poling direction of the crystal is in the 2-mm 
direction (see Fig. 1 for the orientation and dimensions of the 
crystal).  The applied unipolar electric field is in the 5-mm 
direction of the crystal and is of triangular waveform with a 
maximum amplitude of 1.5 MVm-1 and a frequency of 0.01 Hz.  
It is expected that a 90° switching of the crystal’s polarization 
would take place when the first half-cycle of the unipolar 
electric field (i.e., from 0 to 1.5 MVm-1) is applied.  The in-
situ study involves the observation of changes in birefringence 
patterns on the 5 × 5 mm2 face of the crystal during electrical 
loading under a polarized optical microscope. 
Figure 4 shows a series of optical imag
roscopically the crystal switches 90° at about 0.25 MVm-1 
based on the distinct change in image contrast.  This value 
represents the coercive field for 90° switching, which is smaller 
than that for 180° switching (i.e., 0.35 MVm-1, shown in Fig. 
2a).  Abrupt cracking of the crystal at 0.25 MVm-1 is caused 
by the large strain associated with non-180° switching.  The 
size of the cracks increases as the applied field increases from 
0.25 to 1.5 MVm-1.  The birefringence images shown in Fig. 
4b and 4c reveal the formation of bubble-like micro-domains 
prior to the macroscopic 90° switching of the crystal bulk. 
These bubble-like micro-domains can be seen as “switching 
weak points” and are operative at electric fields as low as 0.06 
MVm-1.  This particular in-situ study indicates that regions 
within the BaTiO3 single crystal do not necessarily switch 90° 
at the same time, and hence, in a way, supports the existence of 
multiple 90° switching systems.  However, it should be 
noticed that the observed birefringence images do not directly
