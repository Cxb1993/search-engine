中文摘要 
光學網路比一般傳統的電子網路可提

多工(WDM)即是一種能廣泛運用光學網路
大量頻寬的技術。其中有一個很重要的最佳

題。在這個計畫中，我們關注於 WDM 環狀
網路中的群播 RWA 問題。給定一群播會期
(Multicast Sessions)的集合，群播 RWA 的問

群播 RWA 問題可以被轉換成超圖形嵌入問

Abstract 
Optical networks provide higher 
transmission quality and larger bandwidth for 
high-speed communication than traditional 
electronic networks. Wavelength Division 
Multiplexing (WDM) is one of the techniques 
widely used to exploit the huge bandwidth of 
optical networks. One of the most important 
optimization problems in WDM networks is 
the Routing and Wavelength Assignment 
(RWA) problem. In this project, we are 
concerned with the Multicast RWA problem in 
WDM ring networks. Given a set of multicast 
sessions, the Multicast RWA problem is to 
route the lightpath in the WDM ring network 
to minimize the wavelength requirement or 
the multicast congestion. When the 
wavelength conversion ability is available, the 
multicast RWA problem can be converted to a 
hypergraph embedding problem and solved by 
extending our approximation algorithms in 
[LH05, LH07]. When the wavelength 
conversion ability is unavailable, the problem 
is formulated as an Integer Linear Program 
(ILP).  We solve the ILP by using 
LP-relaxation and rounding heuristic. 
Applying LP-relaxation, the ILP can be solved 
efficiently by reducing the number of integer 
constraints and the number of binary decision 
variables.

studied in the literature [LS00b, K98, SB97]. 
In bidirectional rings, the general RWA 
problem of bundling route selection is studied 
in [LLP00, LS00a, WO97, GK97a]. In this 
case, the RWA with wavelength conversion is 
equivalent to the ring loading problem 
[DRM05, SSW98] and a polynomial-time 
algorithm for uniform traffic requirements is 
given by [VSK96]. However, the RWA on 
ring networks without wavelength conversions 
is NP-complete [GK97a]. Hence, most of 
studies have concentrated on the development 
of heuristic algorithm [LLP00, LS00a, WO97, 
GK97a]. A well-known result [MKR95] 
describes that there is a polynomial-time 
algorithm which solves the unicast RWA 
problem using no more than twice the optimal 
number of wavelengths. In [LLP00], the RWA 
problem on ring networks without wavelength 
conversions is formulated as an integer 
program and hence the approximate solution 
can be obtained by using LP-relaxation and 
column generation techniques. 
Although many studies on ring networks 
have been performed, these researchers have 
concentrated only on the unicast model 
[LLP00, LS00a, WO97, GK97a, MKR95]. In 
this project, we focus on the multicast RWA 
problem in WDM-based bidirectional ring 
networks. Multicast mechanisms over WDM 
networks can be realized in two different 
network constructions: multicast over 
broadcast-and-select networks and multicast 
over wavelength-routed networks [ZP05]. A 
WDM local area network is usually 
constructed based on the broadcast-and-select 
manner. In this kind of single-hop network, 
multicast can be supported in a relatively easy 
way that exploits a star topology with a 
passive star coupler at the hub and each 
station connecting directly to it. Multicast in a 
single hop broadcast-and-select network has 
been extensively studied in recent years. 
Comprehensive surveys on this topic can be 
found in [HK02]. WDM wide area networks 
are usually constructed based on 
wavelength-routed architectures [ZP05]. A 
wavelength-routed network adopts a mesh 
topology and each node in the network is 
equipped with a dynamically configurable 
photonic switch, i.e., OXCs and OADMs. The 
key components to support multicast in a 
wavelength-routed network are light splitters. 
A light splitter is a passive optical device that 
has the inherent capability of splitting an input 
light signal into multiple outputs. Performing 
light splitting is relatively efficient than 
copying packets at the IP layer. This is a key 
benefit of optical multicast as compared with 
IP multicast [ZWQ00]. Issues on optical 
multicast can be classified into data plane 
issues and control plane issues [R03]. On the 
data plane, the fundamental problem is to 
study the architecture of multicast OXC. 
Optimization on data plane is mainly 
constrained by hardware parameters, such as 
power loss introduced by the optical devices, 
commercial availability, and fabrication 
complexity. On the other hand, the focus on 
the control plane issues is the multicast RWA 
problem. The tight coupling between routing 
and wavelength assignment arises from the 
fact that, in order to establish an optical 
connection, we must deal with both selecting a 
suitable route and allocating an available 
wavelength for the connection [PAN04].

formulate the problem as an Integer Linear 
Program (ILP).  The total number of binary 
variables in the ILP grow as O(nmw), where n 
is the number of nodes, m is the number of 
multicast sessions and w is the number of 
sufficient wavelengths. We solve the ILP by 
using LP-relaxation and rounding heuristic. 
Applying LP-relaxation, the ILP can be 
converted into an equivalent MILP 
(mixed-ILP) problem. We can solve the MILP 
efficiently because the number of integer 
constraints and the number of binary decision 
variables in the original ILP can be reduced to 
O(mw)≦O(m2).
