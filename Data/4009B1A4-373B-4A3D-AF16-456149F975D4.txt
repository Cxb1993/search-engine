   隨著建築科技之日新月異以及現代人對於生活品質要求之提升，建築物之功能除了遮蔽
風雨及隔絕不佳之外部氣候，更須滿足人類對於日常生活之各類需求，且建築物構造體尚
需與設備系統進行有效整合，方能提供便利與舒適之生活品質。一般而言，一座現代化之
建築近似於人體構造，建築物所含之空調系統、強弱電系統與給排水系統，與人體之呼吸
系統、神經系統與循環系統之功能相近，而扮演輸送各類生活用水之給排水系統，由於其
大多隱藏與埋設於設備管道空間，其重要性往往被人們所忽視，然而以給水系統而言，雖
然管內輸送等壓而質純之生活用水，但管內壓力隨著使用者之開啟使用所造成之往復壓力
變化，及輸送熱水所承受之溫度變化等，將造成管線銹蝕與滲漏水之情形；而若以排水系
統而言，因管內輸送之物質較為複雜，且通常具有固態及液態混雜之情形，加上各類衛生
器具瞬間排放與樓層高度所產生之管內壓力變動，同樣易造成排水系統之滲漏水與堵塞情
形，若無有效之因應對策，或於相關課題發生前，預先檢測並提出改善措施，對於使用者
之生活，將造成極大之影響。因此本研究將透過文獻回顧與案例現況調查，理解掌握各類
系統之實際狀況，其後依據給排水系統之理論基礎，透過設備之使用年限、材料、構造以
及設計方法之說明，將給排水設備系統分類，並依據不同之配管系統與根據管理學及統計
相關學理之週期評估理論，試圖找出建築給排水生命週期之性能影響因子。以失效模式與
效應分析概念(FMEA)建立排水系統更新評估方法，評估排水系統是否需要維護與更新，再
利用 3ds-max 軟體進行模擬更新決策，使既有建築排水系統能夠透過立體可視化方式，清

Abstract 
Due to the improvement of building technology and upgrade quality of the life, the function 
of building not only provide a shelter for external climate but also have to satisfy all demands for 
daily life. As we know, the construction needs to combine with the equipment system effectively 
in the building which can offer the convenience and comfort. Generally speaking, a modernized 
building is similar to the human body, air conditioner system is to respiratory system, electricity 
system is to nervous system, water supply and drainage system is to the circulatory system of the 
human body. The water supply and drainage system is act the circulatory system of building 
which is sending or giving all kinds of domestic water. Because the systems are mostly hided and 
buried inside the wall or equipment channel space, the importance of its function was often 
ignored by people. In this research, we establish the assessment tools of building drainage system 
which can assist to evaluate demand of the building drainage system by adopting the concept of 
Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA). In addition, taking the advantage of computer simulation 
of changeable layout by using 3D-MAX, it can make three-dimensional visualization and 
traditional-elevation view of the visual interface with each other. Consideration of whole drainage 
system, appropriate decisions can be decided in correct order for the pipeline system and test 
through a variety of programmers which can not only suggest the variety of renovation programs 
but also assist the designers and owners for decision-making of building drainage system. 
Keywords: building water supply and drainage system, renovation and maintenance, life cycle,

2. Methodology 
An observational study of the drainage system and technician interviews were undertaken to 
establish the construction conditions to determine the circumstances which can influence pipe 
age. The model was integrated the factor which may influence the pipe age from design plan, 
pipe material, construction quality to daily use. (Figure2). The evaluation model would follow 
the concept of FMEA. The renewal priority level was proposed after the assessment. Base on 
the priority level, three dimensional computer simulation software would be the interface to 
helping the decision-making of renewal plan which could extend the pipe age. 
 
2.1 Strategy of building drainages during life cycle 
A study on the plumbing life cycle recommended that an in-use building drainage system 
would be examined every 15 years [2]. The life cycle of the drainage system includes 
production, transportation, construction, daily use, maintenance and renovation and disposal. 
2.2 Failure Mode Effect Analysis, FMEA 
Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) is a systematized technique which identifies and ranks 
the potential failure conditions in the drainage system, i.e. the probable damage, in order to 
prioritize remedial treatment for the system and facilities. By using the FMEA concept, 
problems in the drainage system can be detected. According to a systematic case study 
investigation in Taiwan, fundamental categories of this evaluation system for the domestic 
drainage system were identified. The influencing factors were determined from schematic 
observation and empirical experimental results performed previously [3] [4]. The weighting 
coefficient is determined by addressing the severity, occurrence, and detection on FMEA [5] [6]. 
The result will be the multiple of each factor’s weighting coefficient which shows the 
performance ranking. This process can also identify the faults of drainage system for 
preventive maintenance and remedial purposes.  
 
3. Renewal Model of pipe age 
The nine influencing factors are pipe age, building height, using authority of lower floor, 
ceiling, vertical stack setting, building branch movement, piping material, pipe connection 
and Water stain. Each factor was amend using a nine level coefficient as shown in Table 1, the 
higher coefficient, the greater contribution influence.  The weighting coefficient was 
transferred from qualitative description into Quantity.

Level Normal    
Medium
   
Critical
coefficient 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 
The renewal model shown as Equation 1 contains three categories, Severity, Occurrence, and 
Detection. Each category has same factor which will affect the operation of the drainage 
system. The Renewal Priority Number of Drainage (RPN-D) is the ratio of the selected 
products to the minimum of Severity, Occurrence, and Detection, each of which may have 
different weighting. 
……………(1) 
 
The RPN-D is between 1 to 100 which show the probability of Severity, Occurrence and 
Detection. According to the systematic procedure, each factor and its renewal component was 
appraised by professional judgment as shown in Table 2.  
improvement should be provided. 
 
4. Simulation of renewal cases 
4.1 Procedures of Model creating 
The computer software, 3D-max, was adopted to simulate the various options available during 
the re-design stage. Using the computer simulation, different design options are explored 
making it possible to determine the most practical option in terms of pipe route, 
maintainability and than offering minima disruption to the original building fabric all of 
which can be displayed and assessed visually. The input module categories were classified as 
shown as Table 3 which was divided into two items, building base unit and drainage 
equipment. Figure 5 shows the diagram of the modeling process. The original drainage system 
was built at initial processing. The new three dimensional simulations were created after the 
model was updated to coordinate with the renewal priority level.

Figure 6 – present condition of Guo-tai 
 
After the assessment model, the Guo-Tai building was defined as “very High” (Level 1) 
therefore the building was chosen for case study. The plan of the building and drainage 
system was used to prepare for the field survey to confirm the location and system condition 
at present. Figure 7 shows the initial model simulation. Among the computer simulation, the 
practical cases were simulated on three points as below which corresponded to the renewal 
priority level and decision making process. 
 
The location of the drainage system and vent system was emphasized using colors and groups 
as shown as Figure 8. The system was separated into different modules based on the different 
functions to attempt to conform the renewal requirement. Hence, system and structure could 
be used to discuss the strategy of construction and required space. Figure 8(a) shows the 
whole construction of a single floor plan, while Figure 8(b) shows, clearly, the location of 
lavatories by making the building fabric transparent. Figure 9 shows the classification of each 
type. Double-pipe systems were adopted for toilet sewage but the single system was adopted 
for sewage collect of all other appliance. Because of the pressure fluctuation caused by a 
discharging appliance from a higher floor, a trap seal was cost on the lower floor and the foul 
air spread back to interior. Consequently, the single system increase the vent stack to 
combined with the old vent stack. Moreover, T5 and T10 had service shaft without exit, the 
new opened pipe installation were suggested. 
 
Simulation point: 
 
A. The building structure, sub-structure and 
drainage were established by simulation which 
corresponds to the present condition. 
B. The appropriate strategies of renewal were 
proposed after discussing the relationship 
between drainage and sub-structure.  
C. The database was created and it calculated 
the quantity of renewal material.

5. Conclusion 
The drainage renewal model and priority level was proposed by initial research. It can help to 
detect the condition of the drainage system which is affected by nine factors. In order to 
improve the renovation efficiency, the computer simulation was given by a visual process. By 
using the simulation, the relation between drainage and building structure could be identified. 
The renewal proposal contributes appropriated decision making for designers and users. Once 
the renewal simulation is complete and the optimums re-design option selected, the model can 
be used to reassess the new system. The computer simulation could also provide the renewal 
strategy for accuracy on reconstruction and the quantity of material. The visualize simulation
