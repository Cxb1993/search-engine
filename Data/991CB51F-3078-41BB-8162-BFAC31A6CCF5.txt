英文摘要 
The major goal of this project is on the 
model parameter extraction and CMOS 
power transistor cell design. The study of 
CMOS BSIM4 DC and RF model 
parameters extraction and the unit cell 
layout of the power CMOS transistor are 
the major topics of this project. The 
fabrication of the template device set for 
BSIM4 model extraction is by 0.35 μm 
TSMC CMOS process. The last part is the 
layout design of RF CMOS power cell. The 
characterization of power performance is 
by the Load-pull measurement to obtain 
the output power density and the 
corresponding power gain. 
 
二、計畫的緣由與目的 
The development of all the modern 
communication systems tends to be 
implemented in a full CMOS process in 
order to reduce cost and design cycle. Most 
of key components in the RF transceiver 
module, like VCO, LNA, and MIXER, had 
been successfully and entirely implemented 
in the CMOS process. Although the CMOS 
process is widely used in the design of RF 
transceiver, the power amplifier still suffers 
the disadvantage of low breakdown voltage 
with CMOS process. And some of current 
designs still cannot well meet the 
requirements of high output power in the 
applications, like GSM/EDGE, PCS/DCS, 
and Wimax. Because these power 
amplifiers are operated with large signal, 
they must be capable of sustaining the 
applying of larger current and voltage. In 
general, the devices used in the RF power 
amplifications prefer with higher 
breakdown voltage. However, the 
low-breakdown-voltage and hot carrier 
effect are two common features in the 
CMOS process and they will restrict the 
operation of power amplifier dramatically. 
The 0.35μm CMOS process is better than 
0.18μm or 0.13μm on the breakdown 
voltage and much more suitable for RF 
power amplifications. The merely available 
device model for the TSMC 0.35μm CMOS 
process is the widely used spice model. It is 
not suitable for the simulations of large 
signal amplification like RF power 
amplifier. Therefore, it’s necessary to build 
A model extraction procedure was 
implemented on the TSMC 0.35μm RF 
CMOS technology. At first, a complete 
parameters extraction methodology, 
measurement setup about BSIM4 are 
under study. The DC model, of which 
determines I-V characteristic of devices 
and is the fundamental property of MOS 
transistor, is extracted according the 
suggestions of BSIM4 model parameters 
extracting procedure.  All of the measured 
results are fitted to the model simulation by 
the extraction routine of ICCAP 2006 so as 
to obtain the BSIM 4 model parameters. 
The measured data of large size is fitted 
well to the simulated model results. In 
general, well-fitted parameters of large-size 
device are necessary for the model 
extraction. The measured data of other 
devices in corner (small, narrow, short) are 
also used to modify the model parameters. 
However, in order to decrease the 
inaccuracy in the modeling procedure, a 
large number of scaling devices were used 
to verify the extracted result in recursive. 
Usually, a full-wafer test devices are 
required to improve the validity of DC 
model. In this case, there is not enough data 
of scaling devices to certificate the model 
parameters and the accuracy of extraction 
result could be affected slightly in a Global 
Model Extraction Method. The physical 
definitions and equations related to the RF 
performance are also under investigation.  
The results of experiment, the 
S-parameters, gm, output resistance, and 
other properties of small signal operation 
are represented. According to RF 
extracting results, the inaccuracy could be 
resulted from the uncertainty of DC model 
and lack of CV model. A large amount of 
DC data and compact CV model should 
solve this problem.  
The final part is the power cell design and 
measurement with the load-pull system. A 
high power load-pull system is effective in 
the design of power devices, especially for 
RF power amplifier. Through the 
automatic measurement environment, the 
source and load impedance, efficiency, and 
power gain of specified power devices could 
be determined. Because there is no 
standard cell for RF circuit design 
provided by TSMC, all the test devices are 
established and defined manually. However, 
from the measured data of I-V 
characteristics, it is for sure that all devices 
works. All of the information is useful in 
predicting and simulating the power 
amplifier design since the large-signal 
device model is insufficient and 
untrustworthy. An exact and obvious 
large-signal operation of device is practical 
and useful for engineer and researcher to 
design a RF power amplifier. However, the 
measurement data is not so reasonable in 
the relationship between device size and 
performance. In the design of power cell, 
there are two differences between the 
standard cells for digital/analog application 
provided by TSMC and our design: the 
guard-ring (Figure 7) and layout mask for 
doping concentration. In the fabrication 
flow of CMOS 0.35μm, there are two masks 
to define the doping concentration of 
devices which determine the 5V and 3V 
model respectively. In our design, the 
power devices haven’t been set to specified 
doping concentration, therefore all devices 
are designed in typical process of doping 
concentration in this work. Different 
doping condition could be one of reasons 
for the special experimental results of our 
work. Guard-ring for RF MOS is used to 
protected device form noise and signal 
leakage which are generated by another

change or modify the substrate resistance itself. However, the cell body of CMOS transistor 
itself could be connected a extra resistor with the resistance of several kΩ. By this way, the 
insertion loss could be kept at a relative lower level.  
Besides, the power handling capability of the CMOS switch is another key figure of 
merit for the high power applications. It is especially important as the path of Tx being turned 
on and the Rx being turned off. Herein, the power handling capability of the Tx/Rx switch is 
enhanced by using stacked-type topology. Such modification is based on the typical CMOS 
T/R switches as shown in Figure 2. One more transistor M1 added in Rx path is also proposed 
to provide more space on the isolation performance. The detail circuitry is shown in Figure 3. 
As shown in the Figure 4, it is obvious that the isolation between Tx and Rx is significantly 
enhanced after the addition of transistor M1. The accompanied increase on the insertion loss 
is less than 0.5dB as depicted in Figure 5. Nevertheless, the transistor M1 also plays a role on 
the enhancement of power handling. In this case, the power handling could be raised 4 dB 
more. The gate resistors used this chip are 10 kΩ. The Tx/Rx switch is under control with the 
gate input voltage. There are two states: the logic high is gate control voltage being 3.3V, the 
low one is 0V. 
  
Measured Results and Discussions 
 
The die of the SPDT switch was fabricated by TSMC 0.18 um 1P6M standard CMOS 
process. The die photograph of the SPDT switch is shown in Figure 7. The overall chip size 
takes 0.745 × 0.53 mm2.  
Such CMOS switch chip with the proposed topology was characterized with on-wafer 
measurement. The equipments used in the experiment include Agilent 8510C network 
analyzer, Agilent 8241A signal generators, Agilent E4417A power meter. The DC bias to the 
chip was fed by an on-wafer DC probing card. The decoupling capacitors and related DC bias 
circuit were also provided external to the chip so as to perform a stable test. 
The measured insertion loss of the proposed CMOS T/R switch is about 1.9dB on the 
conducting path of Tx-ANT and 2.6dB on that of Rx-ANT, even at the frequency of 10GHz. 
The input/output return loss is kept larger than 10 dB. And the isolations between different 
ports are always greater than 25 dB. The power handling within the Tx-ANT path is capable 
of 28 dBm at 5.8 GHz. The corresponding measured results for the TX-ANT insertion loss, 
the ANT-RX insertion loss, the TX-RX isolation and the RX-TX isolation are plotted in Figure 
8, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively. 
 
Conclusions 
 
A CMOS SPDT switch employing body-floating and stacked-type technique to improve 
power handling is demonstrated by the TSMC 0.18 um 1P6M CMOS process. The power 
handling is capable of +28 dBm without significant increase on the insertion loss after the 
addition of transistor in the path of RX-ANT. Comparing between simulation and 
measurement results, the input/output return loss is both larger than 10 dB and the measured 
insertion loss is roughly 0.8dB higher than that of simulation.
