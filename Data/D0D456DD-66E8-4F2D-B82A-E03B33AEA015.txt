Abstract： 
Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common body complaints worldwide. As 
prevalence of knee OA increases with age, the overall burden of the disease is expected to 
increase with the ageing of the population. To assist doctors to accurately and reproducibly derive 
the knee OA parameters in clinical diagnosis, we proposed a distance-based Active Shape Models 
(ASM) approach to calculating the geometric parameters between the tibia and the femur in an 
anterior-posterior knee radiograph with free manual measurement. The proposed method embeds 
the distance from the initial knee joint boundary into the cost function of ASM to cope with the 
fatal weakness of the traditional ASM, i.e. suffering from outlier configurations in the boundary 
target points. The experimental results show our system can derive these parameters accurately 
and efficiently.

strategies, relying on a priori information about the object shape to guide the segmentation 
process in low contrast area, are required. Although deformable models with many degrees of 
freedom such as snakes [15] and a large number of deformable models [16] can capture the 
inter-individual variability of the anatomical objects shapes in medical images, these models have 
the weakness of being free to take almost any arbitrary but smooth shape without being restricted 
to the shape that is characteristic for a particular object type. The Active Shape Models (ASM) 
introduced by Cootes and Taylor [17] enable the local shape control by representing the contour 
as a polygon with a fixed number of labeled points. Each label refers to a particular landmark 
position on the object boundary so that the labels establish point-to-point correspondences 
between different shapes in a training set with the same object type. After making up for 
differences in object pose by translation, rotation and scaling, a Point Distribution Model (PDM) 
is constructed that characterizes shape variability by a number of independent modes of variation. 
The ASM segments out object boundary by finding the shape and the pose parameters of the 
PDM generated the contour that best fits the object boundary in the image. A shortcoming of this 
procedure is that the target points are determined for each boundary point independently such that 
the outliers may occur when inappropriate target points are selected. These outliers will pull the 
boundary away from the true boundary position. And, such error cannot be corrected during the 
further iterations. Those outliers result from the edge points with strong edge strength. To resolve 
this problem, the target point should be searched in a restricted neighborhood of the initial 
boundary. The range of the neighborhood depends on the accuracy of the initial boundary. The 
more accurate the initial boundary is the smaller the neighborhood is. As the detected initial 
edges. We are only interested in edges within bones. To exclude those edges beyond bones, the 
edge image is ANDed with the thresholded image derived from thresholding the original image. 
The threshold value T is determined by Eq. (2), i.e. the mean gray value of the edges. The 
detected edges trend to be fragmentary. The dilation operation with a 3x3 structure element is 
utilized to reduce the fragmentation. The edge image after dilation is denoted as Id. Fig.1 is used 
to illustrate this process. And, the preprocessing results are demonstrated in Fig. 2.

2.2   Bone Boundaries Finding 
The desired boundaries are the femur boundaries, the tibia boundaries and the joint surfaces. To 
simplify the analysis process, the image I is divided into three parts including the femur part 
starting point for tracing the tibia outside boundary by selecting the first met boundary point from 
MP to the TPF. This process is sketched in Fig. 4.

2.2.3 The Femur and Tibia Joint Boundaries Search 
z Active Shape Model 
Because of the complicated edge structure in the knee joint, it is hard to acquire accurate 
boundaries if without prior knowledge about them. By our investigation, these boundary shapes 
own considerable consistency among different patients. The problem of robustly locating boundary 
with variable but constrained shapes in a noisy environment is generally best tackled by using 
flexible template models. Many methods using flexible template models for image interpretation 
have been proposed, e.g. the active contour models, the finite element models, statistical shape 
models, point distribution models (PDM) and the active shape models (ASM). The ASM locates 
new examples of the interesting contours in images by integrating the point distribution models 
and the gray level appearance around the contours so that the detected contours best match the 
image evidence. Unlike some other approaches, the ASM makes no assumptions about what form

To initialize the ASM deformation process the initial boundary should be identified. The 
initial boundary detection step follows up the preprocessing with edge linking procedure. The 
intercondylar point (i.e. the summit edge point SEP) around the middle axis is sought out first. The 
boundary tracing process starts from the SEP and proceed forward and backward individually. The 
traced boundary with the maximum length is viewed as the distal femoral articular surface. For the 
distal tibial articular surface finding and proximal tibial articular surface finding, the processes are 
similar to the previous stage except that the starting point is produced by looking for the second and 
the third articular surface point downward from the SEP. The starting points search is depicted in 
Fig. 5. For the traditional ASM approach, after the initial boundary estimation the neighborhood 
of each boundary point is searched for a target point that is most likely located on the object 
boundary according to gradient. The ASM parameters are then updated by fitting the shape to the 
target points. A new boundary is generated and the new target points are searched. This updating 
process is repeated until convergence. For this procedure, a significant drawback is the target 
points are determined for each boundary point independently so that the outliers, coming from 
strong edges, may occur when improper target points are adopted. These outliers will draw the 
updated boundary away from the true boundary position. And, this deviation cannot be rectified by

axes are depicted in Fig. 10. The distal femoral joint line and the proximal tibial joint line are 
derived from the distal femoral articular surface and the proximal tibial articular surface with 
excluding the middle parts, individually. Along the perpendicular line of the anatomical femoral 
axis we can find out the two intersection points corresponding to the bottoms of the medial 
condyle and the lateral condyle, respectively. By connecting the two intersection points, the distal 
femoral joint line can be obtained. We can acquire the proximal tibial joint line by applying the 
way similar to the search of the distal femoral joint line except that the search is based on the 
anatomical tibial axis and the two intersection points are located on the proximal tibial articular 
surface.

The anatomical parameters often used in clinical diagnosis include the anatomical lateral 
distal femoral angle, the mechanical medial proximal tibial angle, the joint line congruence angle, 
the mechanical axis deviation and the joint space distances. The anatomical lateral distal femoral 
angle, shown in Fig. 11, is defined as the angle between the anatomical femoral axis and the

3. The Experimental Results 
We have collected sixty cases consisting of 24 normal cases and 36 abnormal cases. To evaluate 
the system performance the knee joint surfaces detected by the DT-based ASM and the related 
geometric parameters are compared with manual approaches. Two clinical experts were invited to 
provide manual solutions. The detected knee joint surface by our system is denoted as B and that 
drawn by the expert is denoted as D. There are two approaches to matching B and D either based 
on B or D. Eqs. (9) and (10) are the corresponding formulas. The knee surface detection error SE 
is the average of the two types of error like Eq. (11). In addition to the knee joint surface 
detection error, we quantify the accuracy of the knee joint related geometric parameters by 
calculating the absolute difference between the detected version and the sketched version.

Table 1 demonstrates the error analysis results of the proposed approach versus the 
shown in Table 5. In the first columns of Table 4 and Table 5, the words min, mean and max 
indicate these corresponding joint space distances defined as MND, AVD and MXD, respectively. 
We can find that it is just like the phenomenon we observed in Table 1 and Table 2 that the error 
of the disease case is usually larger than that of the normal case. By comparing these errors, it can 
be also noted that the derived geometric parameters are accurate except for the mechanical axis 
deviation. In fact, if we consider the definition of the mechanical axis deviation the error is 
acceptable. According to the definition of the mechanical axis deviation, once error exists in the 
anatomic lateral distal femoral angle or/and in the mechanical medial proximal tibial angle the 
induced error in the mechanical axis deviation will be significant. Hence, we can conclude that 
the derived geometric knee parameters are satisfactory. The average processing time for an input 
image is about 0.5 second. The size of the knee radiograph is 1270 by 2160 pixels. The 
experiments were performed on the personal computer with Pentium Ⅳ CPU, 2.4GHz clock rate 
and 512MB main memory.

approach, compensating for the fatal weakness of the traditional ASM, i.e. suffering from outlier 
configurations in the boundary target points, is proposed to detect the knee joint surfaces. The 
concept of individual training and detection for condyles, achieving excellent detection of the 
distal femoral articular surface, is also proposed to overcome the inconsistent size relationship 
between the medial condyle and the lateral condyle that persecutes the detection of the articular 
surface using the ASM-based approach. Based on these boundaries, we can obtain the desired 
distances and angles. The average processing time for each image is about 0.5 seconds. The 
experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method can rival that of the expert 
drawing. These also prove that the proposed method lends itself to the clinical applications.
