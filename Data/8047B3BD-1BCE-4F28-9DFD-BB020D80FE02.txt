英 文 摘 要 ： Source localization of toxic air pollutants is an 
important issue in many environment related fields. 
In this project, we proposed using optical remote 
sensing techniques for the localization applications. 
The goal was to develop improved source localization 
methods with Open-Path Fourier Transform Infrared 
(OP-FTIR) measurements to identify emission sources 
of hazardous air pollutants. We developed and 
evaluated three source localization approaches: (1) 
One-dimensional radial plume mapping (RPM1D). We 
conducted a computer simulation study using the 
Gaussian dispersion model to generate the downwind 
concentrations of plumes from 400 source locations 
under various wind directions. The optical remote 
sensing instrument was assumed to be at (0, 0) with 
two perpendicular monitoring lines. The results 
showed that the accuracy of the method and its 
uncertainty were improved by using the proposed two-
line RPM1D approach rather than the original one-line 
RPM1D approach at most simulated source locations. In 
a follow-up field experiment, a tracer gas was 
released at the coordinate of (100, 100). The release 
location was covered within the 0.25- to 0.5-
probability area of the estimated results. (2) Two-
dimensional radial plume mapping. Seventy-two test 
maps, each having two Gaussian distributions, were 
generated in a two-dimensional domain. The HRPM 
technique with the non-negative least square (NNLS) 
algorithm was then applied to reconstruct the plumes. 
The NNLS algorithm successfully reconstructed the 
source locations of 68 of the 72 test maps. When one 
of the plumes was near the origin, the NNLS did not 
always identify the peak locations correctly. 
Nevertheless, robust results were obtained when the

other words, prior knowledge about the properties of the chemical to be detected is required. 
Unfortunately, this kind of information is not readily available most of the time.  
In this project, we proposed using optical remote sensing techniques to overcome some of the 
limitations associated with the point samplers. More specifically, we focused on the Open-Path 
Fourier Transform Infrared (OP-FTIR) spectroscopy. The OP-FTIR can provide real-time 
information in situ for mixtures of air pollutants and scan a much larger area than the point samplers 
to get spatially representative data. Based on computer simulated and field collected data, we 
developed and evaluated three source localization approaches with the OP-FTIR spectroscopy: (1) 
one-dimensional radial plume mapping; (2) two-dimensional radial plume mapping; (3) inversing 
dispersion models.

running perpendicular to each other. Each monitoring line had three retroreflectors creating three 
segments of equal distance (67 m) for the plume reconstructions. This setup was identical to the one 
used in the subsequent field study. 
Simulation of Downwind Plume Distributions and PIC 
For each source location, the Gaussian dispersion model used to simulate the downwind 
concentrations of the plumes along the two monitoring lines was expressed as 15

where  is the air pollutant concentration at the downwind receptor (x, y, z) in the Cartesian 
coordinate system; Q is the pollutant emission rate; u is the wind speed; H is the effective height of 
the plume; and (y and z) are the standard deviations of the concentration distributions in the 
crosswind and vertical directions, respectively. In this study, we assumed z=0 and H=0. The flow rate 
was fixed at 10 L/min because our preliminary study showed that this provided detectable plumes at 
the ORS monitoring lines.  
At each monitoring line, the wind direction varied within ±45° from the perpendicular to the 
monitoring line with an increment of 1° (i.e., 315° to 45° for the X monitoring line and 45° to 135° 
for the Y monitoring line). The observed PIC (PICobs) of each beam path at a certain wind direction 
was simulated by numerically integrating the simulated plume’s distribution along the monitoring 
line from zero to each of the corresponding retroreflectors. The three PICobs (i.e., one for each beam 
path) were defined as a set of PICobs. 
Source locating 
The first step in locating the sources was to reconstruct the peak locations of the plume along 
the 1D monitoring line using the smooth basis function minimization (SBFM) approach. The SBFM 
fits the distribution functions to satisfy the input beam integrals (i.e., the PICobs). In the fitting 
procedure, a Gaussian distribution was chosen as the basis function, as in most of the previous 
studies. The error function for minimization was defined as the sum of squared errors between the 
observed and predicted PIC (PICpred). The latter term is given as follows:13

where j is the parameter number index; k is the basis function number index; Li is the ith beam path 
length; pjk is the jth parameter of the kth basis function; and Gk is the kth basis function. In this study, k 
equaled 1 (one basis function), j equaled 2 (peak location and standard deviation of the assumed 
Gaussian distribution), and i ranged from 1 to 3 (three beam paths at each monitoring line). The

flow rate set at 10 L/min. The release system was composed of 5 porous tubes (diameter = 5 mm), 
and its dimension was approximately 1 m × 1 m. When the trace gas was released, the OP-FTIR 
scanned the retroreflectors from 1 to 6 sequentially and repeatedly. A complete scan of the 6 beams 
took approximately 5.5 minutes, including 42 seconds to collect one spectrum and 5 to 35 seconds to 
move the IR beam from one retroreflector to the next. A total of 133 complete scans were collected.  
Data Analysis  
The collected spectra were quantified using the classical least squares method to obtain the 
PICobs (in ppm-m). The quantification region for SF6 was from 935 to 955 cm-1.17 Because the wind 
data were collected at a higher temporal resolution than for the OP-FTIR spectra, their mean values 
were calculated to match the corresponding collection period of each PICobs set. We further applied a 
moving average scheme with a group size of 2 on the PICobs and wind data to reduce errors resulting 
from temporal variability.14 The SBFM algorithm was implemented on these moving average values 
to obtain the peak locations at the downwind monitoring lines. Using the one-line or two-line RPM1D 
approach, we estimated the source locations from the wind data and the reconstructed peak locations. 
The following screening criteria were implemented to improve the source locating results. (1) 
The Concordance Correlation Factor between the measured and predicted PIC (CCFPIC), which is 
similar to the Pearson correlation coefficient with adjustments for the shifts in location and scale,14 
was calculated to represent the goodness of fit during the SBFM reconstruction. We excluded the 
peak reconstruction results with a CCFPIC below 0.7. (2) A large variation in wind direction when 
collecting each PICobs set gave additional errors because the three beam paths were not scanned 
simultaneously. Therefore, we eliminated the peak reconstruction results if the corresponding 
standard deviation (SD) of wind directions was larger than 20°. (3) Previous studies have shown that 
the SBFM algorithm might not reconstruct the peak locations accurately when the downwind 
concentrations congregated within a certain segment of the beam path.13 We eliminated the data set if 
one of the PICobs segments (i.e., the difference between two adjacent PICobs) was higher than 90% of 
the largest PICobs. (4) When calculating the intersection points from the line equations, having two 
wind directions that were too close to each other (i.e., similar slopes) would give a solution that was 
unreasonably far away from the experimental domain. We excluded the estimated source locations if 
the angle between the paired wind directions was less than 5°.13 
2.2  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Simulation Study 
Figure 2.2 shows the locating results from using the X-, Y-, and XY-RPM1D approaches at three 
example source locations at (100, 100), (150, 100), and (150, 150). As observed in previous studies, 
the uncertainty of the estimated source locations was distributed quite perpendicularly to the 
monitoring line when the one-line RPM1D approach was applied (Figure 2.2, Column 1: X-RPM1D ; 
8 
 
was no clear trend at the 50% uncertainty levels, but the two-line RPM1D approach provided 
consistently smaller AREA values at the 25% uncertainty level. In the sensitivity analysis, we added 
30% noise to the input PICobs values and this trend was even more apparent (Table 2.1). Among all of 
the simulated source locations, the mean AREA50% was 10.4 m2 and 6.5 m2 by using one- and 
two-line RPM1D, respectively, when limited to locations with good precisions of DIST<40 m. The 
corresponding mean AREA25% was 40.8 m2 and 22.2 m2, respectively.  
Field study 
The average wind speed was 3.1 m/s in the field study within the preferred range of 1 to 8 m/s, 
as suggested in OTM-10. The wind mainly originated from the northeast direction in the field study 
(Figure 2.1). The standard deviation of the wind direction within each PICobs set ranged between 5.7° 
to 55.7°, which was relatively large compared to the value found in a previous study (=10°).13 The 
detection limit of PICobs collected in the field study ranged between 0.02 to 0.08 ppm-m, and 
measurements below the detection limit were set as 0. The mean PICobs was 1.7 ppm-m with a 
standard deviation of 2.3 ppm-m. The PIC sets with all three PICobs at 0 were not included in the 
following SBFM reconstruction because they provided limited information about the distributions of 
the plumes.  
In the SBFM reconstruction process, the original mean CCFPIC was 0.66 and 0.71 based on data 
collected in the X- and Y-monitoring lines, respectively. After applying the screening criteria, the 
number of PICobs sets available for locating the sources was 18 and 42 for the two monitoring lines, 
respectively, and the CCFPIC ranged between 0.83 and 1. The estimated source locations are shown in 
Figure 2.5 (Row 1), and the grayscale bar represents the relative frequency of occurrence of these 
locations. Due to the small number of input PIC sets and the resulting intersection points, regions 
with a high relative frequency of occurrence were difficult to observe directly in the plots and did not 
actually cover the true source location. The DIST values ranged between 28.4 and 53.5 m. Several 
efforts were made to improve the results. First, a spatial averaging filter with a filter size of 5 m-by-5 
m was implemented.18 The source locations in the resulting plots were much more discernible 
(Figure 2.5, Row 2). Second, an uncertainty analysis based on the Monte Carlo method19 was 
incorporated in the source locating process by resampling the peak locations randomly 300 times 
within the range of the SBFM reconstructed value  10 m for each PICobs set and then solving the 
line equations.13 Thus the number of intersection points (Figure 2.5, Row 3) was 300 times higher 
than the original number of solutions. Third, we kept only the results when the corresponding wind 
direction was within 45° perpendicular to the monitoring lines (Figure 2.5, Row 4). The final DIST 
and AREA25% were the smallest using the two-line RPM1D approach (=18.4 m and 4697 m2) 
compared to the 29.0-62.2 m and 5561-5792 m2 from the one-line RPM1D approaches. 
Although previous studies have demonstrated the utility of the one-line RPM1D approach, we 
found that its performance was less than ideal, especially for the X monitoring line in the current

3. TWO-DIMENSIONAL RADIAL PLUME MAPPING 
Several researchers have applied optical remote sensing (ORS) instruments with the computed 
tomography (CT) technique to locate the pollution sources in a timely fashion..20, 21 However, the 
involvement of complicated CT beam geometry composed of more than one ORS instrument or 
multiple detectors limited its real-world application.22, 23 A novel radial plume mapping (RPM) 
technique using only one ORS instrument with multiple retroreflectors was proposed for further 
improvement in this field. The US EPA ‘Other Test Method 10’ (OTM-10),14 which was released in 
2006, provided the guidelines for conducting RPM measurements. The horizontal radial plume 
mapping (HRPM) technique described in the OTM-10 was designed to locate hot spots of air 
contaminants. In previous studies, this technique was evaluated with both computational simulation 
approaches24, 25 and field experiments.26, 25 For example, in Hashmonay et al.,25 the author 
demonstrated that the HRPM technique was able to give comparable results for plume 
characterization to the CT technique. In our previous study,17 we further evaluated the performance 
difference between two reconstruction algorithms that were commonly used in the HRPM technique.  
What is less known is the feasibility of using the HRPM technique for identifying multiple 
plumes of the same substance. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the HRPM technique to 
locate two plumes with computational simulation data. A series of test maps with two plumes along 
with the associated path integrated concentration (PIC) data were simulated. These PIC data were 
then reconstructed by the HRPM technique to estimate the peak locations. Several modifications 
were also proposed to improve this technique.  
3.1 MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Generation of Test Maps and Associated PIC 
The study domain was set at 30 × 30 dimensionless units and was further divided into nine 
pixels of equal size. A nine-beam geometry was assumed to have one ORS instrument at the origin 
and the path-defining components (e.g., retroreflectors) on the edge of each pixel such that the beam 
paths passed through the center of each pixel (Figure 3.1a). This was to maximize the beam path 
length within each pixel and minimize the error magnification of the algorithm.27 Two symmetric 
Gaussian distributions with the same height, width (standard deviation, SD=2), and shape were 
generated with the peak locations at the center of different pixels to form one test map. Thus, the 
total number of the test maps in this series was 36 (= 9
2C ). Another series of test maps (n=36) were 
generated with larger SD (=4) at the same locations. Previous studies also used the Gaussian 
distributions to generate the test maps22, 28 and thus allowed the researchers to directly compare the 
input parameters to the parameters obtained from the reconstructed algorithm.24 The observed PIC 
(PICobs) of the nine beam paths were calculated by integrating the simulated Gaussian distributions 
and were defined as follows:  
18 
 
and scale. A CCF equal to 1 represents a perfect match between the two sets of data. Second, a 
successful reconstruction result was defined as having the peak locations of both underlying 
Gaussian plumes covered by regions with a relative concentration above 0.5 (CONCE50%) in the 
reconstructed maps. The relative concentrations were calculated by standardizing the reconstructed 
results with the highest concentration among each map so that the maximum was 1. The last 
indicator was the area of the CONCE50%, which was used to describe the uncertainty of the 
reconstruction results. 
3.2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
One example of the test distributions (SD=2) and the reconstructed results is given in Figures 
3.1b and 3.1c. Both test plumes were away from the origin (in Pixels G and I). The CCFPIC was 1, 
indicating that it obtained the converged solution. The NNLS algorithm gave reasonably good 
estimates of the source locations. The area of CONCE50% was 138.3 square units (15.4% of the 
studied area) and covered both real source locations. Similar results were also observed for the wide 
plumes (SD=4, Figures 3.1d and 3.1e). The area of CONCE50% was 187.3 square units and covered 
both real source locations. The overall reconstruction results for the test maps with SD=2 are given 
in Table 3.1. The high CCFPIC values for both the successful and failed cases (0.93±0.08 and 
0.94±0.05, respectively) indicated that the NNLS algorithm successfully found converged results. 
Among the 36 test maps, 32 of them were with the CONCE50% covering both plumes (success 
rate=89%), and the average area for successful reconstructions was 174.0±24.5 square units (<20% 
of the studied area). Better performance was observed for the large plumes. The CONCE50% covered 
both peak locations in all test maps (success rate=100%) and the average area of CONCE50% was 
204.6±20.6 square units (22% of the studied area). Note that the area statistics obtained from the 
plumes with different sizes (i.e., SD=2 vs. 4) should not be compared directly since a wider plume 
naturally yields a larger area of CONCE50% . 
Figure 3.2 shows examples of two plumes in proximity of each other. Although the two real 
source locations were covered by the CONCE50% in all four examples, the NNLS algorithm was not 
able to separate the two closely spaced plumes (Figure 3.2, 2nd column) especially for the ones with 
SD=2. This was because the current beam geometry has relatively coarse pixels and did not have 
sufficient spatial resolution to differentiate the two plumes. In spite of the high CCFPIC values 
obtained (>0.99), the NNLS algorithm tended to merge the two small plumes into one large plume. 
Note that the pixel resolution was limited by the number of beam paths. On the other hand, the 
current beam geometry was adequate to reconstruct two plumes that were not adjacent to each other, 
as demonstrated in Figure 3.1. This suggests that the HRPM technique could be used as a screening 
tool to narrow down the area to search for the potential emission sources, rather than to map the 
exact spatial distributions of the plumes. In that type of application, it is not critical to separate the 
two plumes, and conventional point samplers could be employed in the follow-up survey to acquire 
more accurate source location estimation.  
20 
 
incorporate the grid translation (GT) technique29, 28 into the original NNLS algorithm to further 
decrease the uncertainty (i.e., area of the CONCE50%). The SBFM was not considered in this case 
because the segmenting information was very limited when the plume was away from the origin.26, 17 
Previous studies have shown that combining the conventional CT with the GT technique provides a 
more accurate concentration estimate than using only the CT approach.28 In the GT technique, the 
pixels described in the experimental configuration were modified each time that a NNLS 
reconstruction was performed. In this study, the basis grid cells (i.e., pixels) were translated along the 
x and/or y directions by multiples of one-fifth of the width of the basis grid cell. The total number of 
translated grids was 25 (five times on the x-axis by five times on the y-axis). For each of the 25 
translated grids, the NNLS reconstruction was implemented to estimate the concentration within 
each pixel. The reconstructed concentrations from these 25 grids were further interpolated by kriging 
to produce an overall map with a finer resolution. The results showed that adding the GT technique 
into the NNLS algorithm did not improve the ability of the HRPM technique to reconstruct the 
plumes (Figures 3.2f and 3.2l). This was because the area of several translated pixels on the edges 
was small and the NNLS algorithm assigned high values in those small pixels when a plume was 
detected by a beam path near the edges. Good results were obtained by incorporating GT into the 
conventional CT technique because the multiple ORS instruments and scanning beam paths formed a 
complicated beam geometry. This guaranteed that all pixels were passed by an adequate number of 
beam paths even during the translation to provide additional information for confining the possible 
solutions. 
For the sensitivity analysis, various levels of noise were added to the PIC data. Although 
generally the number of failed cases increased when more random error was added as expected, this 
number increased to just 5 cases for the narrow plumes at the 10% level and remained as 0 for the 
wide plumes at the 20% level. In our own field QA/QC evaluation, the accuracy for one of the 
common ORS instruments, the open-path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, was estimated to 
be within ±5% to ±10%. This suggests that applying the NNLS algorithm on OP-FTIR data should 
provide reliable results during stable weather conditions. It is worth noting that fluctuating 
meteorological conditions may introduce additional errors since in the real-world application the PIC 
data of each beam path usually are not collected simultaneously. The magnitude of this type of error 
could be partially reduced by calculating the moving average of the input PIC before the NNLS 
reconstruction, as described in the OTM-10 and Hashmonay.10 The mean area of the CONCE50% did 
not vary significantly at different noise levels (data not shown), indicating that the uncertainty was 
less affected by the added error. 
To further evaluate the performance of the HRPM technique, the peak location of each plume in 
the test maps was shifted randomly within the original pixel of choice. This process was repeated 
three times for each map so 216 (3x2x36) additional test maps were generated. Among the three 
series test maps with wide plumes (n=36 each), 10, 7 and 6 of them did not have both peak locations 
22 
 
(judged from the measurements of the short beam paths), the beam geometry should be adjusted and 
moved away from the plume. Further field experiments should be implemented to verify the 
simulation results.

4. INVERSING DISPERSION MODELS 
In this study, we used an open-path Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (OP-FTIR) to 
collect the path integrated concentration (PIC) data downwind from the sources. The advantages of 
applying optical remote sensing techniques included obtaining real-time data, detecting multiple 
VOCs simultaneously, and covering large spatial areas. By combining with the meteorological data, 
the source location can be reconstructed through reversing the air dispersion models.1, 30 The 
objective of this study was investigating the feasibility of this technique through computational and 
field experiments.    
4.1 METHODS   
We set up three discrete monitoring lines at the downwind site of the survey area near an 
industrial complex in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The field experiments were implemented with tracer gas 
released at a known location (Fig. 4.1). The releasing rate was set at 3.13 g/s. The distance between 
the source and the monitoring lines was 355, 565, and 780m, respectively (Fig. 4.1).   
Before the field experiment, we conducted computational simulation study with the same setup 
as in the field experiment. The simulation domain was 1000×1000m, consist of our experiment area. 
In the simulation experiment, the US EPA ISCST3 model was used to generate the downwind 
concentration. The ISC3 model was a steady-state Gaussian dispersion model which can be used to 
simulate emissions from a wide range of sources. The input data needed for the ISCST3 model were 
emission source information and meteorological data. Meteorological data of temperature, relative 
humidity, and monitoring station pressure were retrieved from the Taiwan Data Bank of Atmospheric 
Research (DBAR) while the wind direction and wind speed data were measured by a weather station 
near the monitoring lines. The emission source information including the location of the source and 
the strength of the emission (i.e. the emission rate) were set as the same as the field experiment. The 
downwind concentration along each monitoring line with resolution of 1 m was calculated using the 
ISCST3 model. Consequently, the PIC data of each monitoring line were calculated by summing up 
the concentration value multiplied by 1m.  
The source location (x, y) and the emission rate (Q) were reconstructed through inversing the 
ISCST3 model. The error function for minimization during the inversing process was the sum of 
squared errors (SSE) between the observed and predicted PIC, which is given as follows:

where the PICobserved was the measured PIC data and the PICpredicted was obtained from the integration 
of the ISC3 modeling results with unknown parameters x, y and Q. Once the SSE was minimized, 
the unknown parameters can be estimated and thus reconstruct the source information. The SSE 
minimizing process was implemented by using the built-in function “lsqnonlin” in the MATLAB

Below are some presentations that I personally feel most useful for my research and 
teaching activities. 
1. Panel T05-01: “Quantifying Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and Air Toxic Emissions: 
Technologies, Applications, and Verification/Validation Issue”. In this panel discussion, it 
was mentioned that the emission factors can give results that are different from the ones 
determined through field measurements. Thus a series of studies based on optical remote 
sensing technologies was introduced by five panel members. These techniques included
Differential Absorption LIDAR (DIAL), open-path FTIR and cavity ring-down 
spectroscopy. Their findings did correspond well to our current research results that most 
emission estimates based on available database are probably underestimated by several 
orders of magnitude.   
2. Paper# 476: “An Inverse-modeling Approach Using AERMOD to Estimate Downwind 
Gas Concentrations”. In this study, the researchers inversed the US EPA AERMOD model 
to estimate the hydrogen sulfide emission rates from swine confined animal feeding 
operations (CAFOs). It was concluded that these estimates can be applied to determine 
ambient hydrogen sulfide concentrations; but not to assess the actual emission rate. The 
full modeling results have been published in Atmospheric Environment 2011, 45, 
4617-4625.   
3. Paper# 478: “Soot emission measurement in flares by sky-LOSA: experimental correction 
of the direct sun-light scattering bias”. Soot emission may have strong impact on air 
quality and human health. Nevertheless, direct measurement of industrial flares is difficult 
to be performed. A novel approach of Sky-LOSA, which is a Line-Of-Sight Attenuation 
method that uses sky light as reference source, was introduced. For clear sky conditions, it 
was concluded that adjusting the camera positions and angles might be a more feasible

Before the field experiment, we conducted computational simulation study with the same setup 
as in the field experiment. The simulation domain was 1000×1000m, consist of our experiment 
area. In the simulation experiment, the US EPA ISCST3 model was used to generate the 
downwind concentration. The ISC3 model was a steady-state Gaussian dispersion model which 
can be used to simulate emissions from a wide range of sources5. The input data needed for the 
ISCST3 model were emission source information and meteorological data. Meteorological data of 
temperature, relative humidity, and monitoring station pressure were retrieved from the Taiwan 
Data Bank of Atmospheric Research (DBAR) while the wind direction and wind speed data were 
measured by a weather station near the monitoring lines. The emission source information 
including the location of the source and the strength of the emission (i.e. the emission rate) were 
set as the same as the field experiment. The downwind concentration along each monitoring line 
with resolution of 1 m was calculated using the ISCST3 model. Consequently, the PIC data of 
each monitoring line were calculated by summing up the concentration value multiplied by 1m.  
The source location (x, y) and the emission rate (Q) were reconstructed through inversing the 
ISCST3 model. The error function for minimization during the inversing process was the sum of 
squared errors (SSE) between the observed and predicted PIC, which is given as follows:

,,           (Eq.1) 
where the PICobserved was the measured PIC data and the PICpredicted was obtained from the 
integration of the ISC3 modeling results with unknown parameters x, y and Q. Once the SSE was 
minimized, the unknown parameters can be estimated and thus reconstruct the source information. 
The SSE minimizing process was implemented by using the built-in function “lsqnonlin” in the 
MATLAB software.  
The concordance correlation factor (CCF) between the observed PIC and the predicted PIC 
was to describe the fitness between two sets of data. The low CCF values (CCF<0.8) indicates that 
the reconstructed PIC did not fit the observed PIC well6.  
One factor that could affect the results was the variation of the wind speed and direction. Thus, 
we calculated the moving average of the measured PIC data and meteorological data for 
reconstruction. Furthermore, we added errors (±5°) to the wind direction data in the uncertainty 
analysis.

In the uncertainty analysis of adding errors to the wind direction measurements, the 
reconstructed locations of using original PIC data still clustered around the tracer gas location (Fig. 
4a). On the other hand, the reconstructed locations with using moving average PIC based on a 
grouping of three or five cycles did not improve the results (Fig. 4b&c).
