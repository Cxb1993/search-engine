Abstract 
 
 Bonding with fiber reinforcements can increase the stiffness of elastic layers only when 
the elastic layer is compressed. Fiber loses its rigidity when it is not stretched. The procedure 
to include this ‘tension-only’ nonlinearity in the deformation analysis of the fiber-reinforced 
bearing is developed. In the elastic layers bonded with tension-only reinforcements, the 
responses to the compression force and the bending moment are coupled unless the 
reinforcements are entirely in tension. The coupled relation, which is not linear, depends on 
the length of the tension zone in the reinforcement. Increasing the compression force on the 
bearings will extend the tension zone in the reinforcements and enhance the stiffness of the 
bearing, but the compression force may add more bending moment to the bearings and 
increase the lateral deformation. The vertical buckling load of the bearings with tension-only 
reinforcements varies with the lateral force and is smaller than the buckling load of the 
bearings with linear reinforcements.  
 
Keywords: Elastomeric bearing; Fiber reinforcement; Seismic isolation. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
A laminated elastomeric bearing consists of elastomeric layers bonded to interleaving 
reinforcing sheets. High stiffness of reinforcements restrains the lateral expansion of 
elastomeric layers and results in higher compression stiffness in the vertical direction normal 
to the layer than an elastomeric layer without bonding to reinforcements. By this 
characteristic, the laminated elastomeric bearing can provide high vertical rigidity to sustain 
gravity loading, while still providing the same horizontal flexibility of the elastomer without 
bonding. 
Traditional bearings use steel plates as reinforcement. To analyze the stiffness of the 
steel-reinforced bearings, the steel reinforcement is treated as completely rigid. The 
 4
normal to the reinforcements before deformation become parabolic after loading. The 
stiffness of a single elastic layer bonded with linear reinforcements is derived first. Then, the 
method to solve the stiffness of the elastic layer with tension-only reinforcements is 
developed, which is applied to calculate the displacement of the bearings subjected to the 
vertical compression and horizontal shear forces. Finally, the stability analysis of the bearings, 
which includes the shear deformation effect, is carried out. 
 
2. Governing equations 
 
An elastic layer in the infinite-strip bearing, which has a width of 2b and a thickness of t, 
is shown Fig. 1. The top and bottom surfaces of the elastic layer are perfectly bonded to 
flexible reinforcements of thickness ft . A local coordinate system (x, y, z) is located at the 
center of the elastic layer. The y-axis is attached to the infinite-long direction. The length of 
the bearings of infinite-strip shape is much larger than the other dimensions, so that the 
deformation of the bearing is assumed to be in plane strain state and only a unit length of the 
bearing is analyzed. Under a compression force P and a pure bending moment M, the 
thickness of the elastic layer is reduced by Δ ; the top and bottom reinforcements rotate to 
form an angleφ . The displacements of the elastic layer along the x and z directions, denoted 
as u and w respectively, are assumed to have the form 
)()41)((),( 12

zxzxw )(),( φ+Δ−=  (2) 
in which 1u  represents the horizontal displacement of the reinforcements; the term of 0u  
represents the additional bulging or shrinking displacement in the elastic layer which is 
assumed to be parabolic. The vertical displacement in Eq. (2) fulfills the assumption that 
planes parallel to the reinforcements remain planar. 
For isotropic elastic layers, the mean pressure p has the following relation with the 
displacements 
)(),( ,, zx wuzxp +−= κ  (3) 
where κ  is the bulk modulus of the elastic layer, and the commas imply differentiation with 
respect to the indicated coordinate. The effective pressure p  is defined as

which becomes, when using the displacement assumptions in Eqs. (1)-(2),

Fig. 3(b) plots the initial guess of 0x  and the converged value of c as functions of the 
deformation ratio )/( φbΔ , which indicates that the initial guess of 0x  can be treated as the 
upper bond of the starting point c. 
Using the solved starting point c, the distributions of zzσ  and xxN along the x-axis for 
different deformation ratios )/( φbΔ  are plotted in Fig. 4, which shows that the 
reinforcement is subjected to tension at the place where the effective vertical stress of the 
elastic layer is negative; the small positive zzσ exits at the place where 0=xxN . 
Since the staring point c is fixed for a particular deformation ratio )/( φbΔ , the 
coefficients ia  are not changed as long as the ratio of t/Δ  to tb /φ  is the same. In other 
words, when the deformations t/Δ  and tb /φ  are changed by the same scale, the forces 
)/(EbP  and )/( 2EbM  will be linearly varied with the same scale. 
The variations of compression force and bending moment with thickness reduction for a 
fixed tilting angle are plotted in Fig. 5. When φb≥Δ , the bending moment is constant and 
the compression force linearly reduces the thickness like an elastic layer with linear 
reinforcements. When φb−≤Δ , the bending moment is constant and the tension force 
linearly increases the thickness like an elastic layer without reinforcement. Therefore, when 
0=φ , the curve of compression force becomes bilinear and the curve of bending moment is 
0=M . 
The variations of bending moment and compression force with tilting angle for a fixed 
thickness reduction are plotted in Fig. 6. When 0=Δ , the constant deformation ratio, 
0)/( =Δ φb , gives the fixed c point which means the coefficients ia  are constant, so that the 
curves for 0=Δ  are linearly varied with φ . When 1/ =Δ t  and 1/ ≤tbφ , the 
compression force is constant and the bending moment linearly varies with the tilting angle 
like an elastic layer with linear reinforcements. When 1/ −=Δ t  and 1/ ≤tbφ , the tension 
force is constant and the bending moment linearly varies with the tilting angle like an elastic 
layer without reinforcement. 
To check the accuracy of the proposed solution procedure, a nonlinear finite element 
analysis on a bearing of 20 elastic layers has been carried out. In the finite element analysis, 
each elastic layer is modeled by four layers of the 4-node plane-strain elements with 
incompatible bending modes. The reinforcement is modeled by the bilinear elastic bar 
elements which have zero stiffness in compression. The results of the finite element analysis 
are plotted in Fig. 4 to Fig. 6, which indicates that the solutions of the proposed procedure are

The shear stiffness of the bearing used for seismic or vibration isolation is usually much 
less than the compression stiffness or the resistance of bending, so that the shear deformation 
has to be considered in the deformation analysis of the bearing. The slope of the deformed 
column axis is equal to the summation of the rotation of the cross-section ψ  and the angle 
of shear deformation γ

Since the lateral deformation of the bearing is anti-symmetric to the middle height of the 
bearing )( h=ζ  where 0=ζψ dd  and the bending moment 0=M , the bending moment 
acting at the ends of the bearing is 
FhM =0  (47) 
The bending moment in the bearing can be expressed as 
ζFMM −= 0  (48) 
The first-order differential equations in Eqs. (42), (43) and (46) for the three dependent 
variables υ , ψ  and ω  can be solved by numerical method. The values of t/Δ  in Eq. 
(42) and t/φ  in Eq. (43) are calculated from Eq. (41) by using the bending moment M in Eq. 
(48).  
The deformation of the bearings with tension-only reinforcements are solved by the 
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with the step size 50/h . The vertical displacement at the 
top of the bearing and the rotational angle of the cross-section at the middle height of the 
bearing are shown in Fig. 10 as a function of the compression force. The ω  value is positive 
when the vertical displacement is downward. The negative ω  value shown in the cases of 
the smaller compression force indicates that the center of the bearing is uplifted. The 
cross-section rotation is reduced by increasing the compression force, because the tension 
zone in the reinforcement is increased and the bearing becomes stiffer. The same 
phenomenon can also be observed in Fig. 11 where the horizontal displacement at the top of 
the bearing and the lateral stiffness of the bearing, defined as )(/ HFK H υ= , are plotted as 
a function of the compression force. Figure 11 shows that the bearing has smaller lateral

where hH 2=  is the height of the bearing and )/( 2GAHIEb=ρ  is the ratio of bending

of columns including shear deformation (Kelly, 1997; Tsai and Hsueh, 2001; Tsai and Kelly, 
2005). 
The lateral stiffness for the bearings with tension-only reinforcements is solved by the 
fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with the step size 50/h  and is plotted in Fig. 12 as a 
function of the compression force to compare with the bearings with linear reinforcements. 
For the bearings with tension-only reinforcements, different horizontal forces have different 
curves of lateral stiffness. In general, the lateral stiffness decreases with increasing the 
compression force, except for the cases that both the horizontal and compression forces are 
small. Each curve reaches a point that the numerical analysis cannot converge, which means 
the horizontal displacement is very large and the structure becomes unstable. When the 
horizontal force is small, this unstable point happens at higher lateral stiffness, which 
indicates that, if the compression force starts to increase from zero, the bearing will suddenly 
collapse when the compression force reaches the unstable point.   
 
7. Conclusion 
 
In the elastic layers bonded with linear reinforcements, the thickness of the layer is 
reduced by the compression force and the surface of the layer is tilted by the bending moment; 
the responses of the compression force and the bending moment are not coupled. In the 
elastic layers bonded with tension-only reinforcements, these responses are coupled unless 
the reinforcements are entirely in tension. The coupled response relation which is not linear 
depends on the length of the tension zone in the reinforcement. The length of the tension zone 
varies with the ratio of the thickness reduction to the tilting angle. Therefore, if the 
compression force and the bending moment are changed by the same proportion, the 
thickness reduction and the tilting angle will vary by that proportion. 
For the bearings of laminated elastic layers interleaving with tension-only reinforcements, 
increasing the compression force will extend the tension zone in the reinforcements and 
enhance the lateral stiffness of the bearing, which seems to be able to reduce the lateral 
displacement of the bearings. But if the secondary moment created by the compression force 
is considered, increasing the compression force will add more bending moment on the
