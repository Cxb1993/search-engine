angular moving bars positioned along the X-direction with flow
directing in the Z-direction. In addition, local dimensionless ve-
locity, mean velocity, and friction factor-Reynolds number prod-
ucts are obtained for various sizes of moving bars in a channel.
2 Analysis
Figures 1a and 1b show the overall view of the physical
model and cross section of the channel investigated. Assume that
a steady-state, fully developed laminar channel flow between the
upper and the lower plates. The height of the channel is 2aH and
both the left and the right sides of the channel extend to infinity.
Inside the channel, a series of bars were arrayed along the
X-direction. The bars are moving slowly and parallel to the
Z-direction for forward and reverse directions with different ve-
locities. The height of bar is 2bH and the width of the bar is equal
to 21−cH. Therefore, the cross-section area of each moving bar
is H2b1−c. Note that the flow direction is normal to the paper
and is in the positive Z-direction. Since the flow velocity is very
slow, the negligible inertia force is assumed.
The moving bars with the velocity U are arrayed along the
X-direction in the channel. The governing equation can be ex-
pressed as follows:
2WzX,Y =
1

dp
dZ
= const 1
where Wz is the flow velocity in the z-direction, dp /dZ is the
pressure gradient in the z-direction, and  is the viscosity.
Introducing the dimensionless parameter
w = − Wz/H2dp
dZ 
x =
X
H
and
y =
Y
H
into Eq. 1, the constant dimensionless pressure gradient in the
z-direction can be expressed as −1. The analysis considered the
domain with a period 2H and focused on the range from X=0 to
X=H and Y =0 to Y =aH, where 2a is normalized distance be-
tween plates. The range is symmetric about the Y-axis in X=0 and
symmetric about the X-axis in Y =aH. One part of the channel, an
L-shaped region with two combined rectangles, as shown in Fig.
1c, is selected to be investigated. The L-shaped region in Fig.
1b is re-expressed and magnified into Fig. 1c with length and
width in a dimensionless form. The governing equation can be
rewritten in the dimensionless form of Poisson equation
2wx,y = − 1 2
The dimensionless governing equation for the left rectangle of the
L-shaped domain is
2w1x,y = − 1 3
subject to the boundary conditions
w1x,0 = 0

where u is the dimensionless velocity of the moving bars and
given as

Next, the dimensionless governing equation of the right rectangle
can be expressed as follows:

stress, and a reverse flow occurs in the channel. Under this cir-
cumstance, both the forward flow and backward flow are observed
to coexist in the channel. For a larger adverse velocity of the bars
in the reverse direction, u=−1.0, the fluid velocities are displayed
in Fig. 5. It is shown that the velocity of the adverse flow induced
by shear stress is greater than the velocity of the positive flow
induced by the fluid pressure gradient. In this situation, a reverse
flow takes place in the entire channel, i.e., wx ,y0.
Figure 6 presents the effects of the velocity of bars on the mean
fluid velocity under five different A’s with the velocity of bars in
the range of −1.0u1.0. In order to evaluate the influence of
the cross-section area and the velocity of bars on the mean fluid
velocity, the value of b in the figure is set at a fixed value, b
=0.5. When the velocity of bars increases from −1 to 1, the mean
fluid velocity will gradually increase. Also, the effects of the
cross-section areas of the bars A on the mean fluid velocity are
observed in the figure. When A is larger, the velocity of bars will
influence both the shear stress and mean fluid velocity signifi-
cantly. Besides, when A is larger, the mean velocity is also larger.
Figure 7 plots the effects of different u on f Re under five bars
with different cross-section areas. The f Re gradually decreases
when the velocity of bars varies from −1 to 1. Besides, when the
velocity of bars is a negative number, f Re will increase with an
increasing A. Conversely, a larger A will lead to a decrease in
f Re when the velocity of bars is a positive number. The f Re
value is not a constant similar to a classical channel without mov-

A larger A will cause a larger wmean and a smaller f Re. Figure
9b shows f Re on different aspect ratios ar under the condition
of u=−0.5. Due to the positive pressure gradient, the direction of
fluid flows is frontward, but if the bars move in the adverse direc-
tion, the friction between the two motions of opposite directions
will increase. As a result, the values of f Re in Fig. 9b are
higher than those in Fig. 9a.
Figure 10 shows the contour plot of u when wmean is zero for
different a and b values, and the case of the figure is A=0.25. As
observed in the figure, the increase in a will lead to an increase in
the volumetric flow rate; therefore, for obtaining wmean=0, the
reverse velocity of the bars have to be increased. Besides, the
increase in b will decrease 1−c, and leads to an increase in the
shear stress in the −z-direction. Therefore, the smaller adverse
velocity of the bars can help obtain wmean=0.
Finally, the analytical solution in this study can be easily com-
puted by the point-match methods. For realizing coefficients An
and Bm, the values of An and Bm are listed in Table 1.
4 Conclusions
The following conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing
results of this study.
1 Under the case of the negative velocity of the bars, the
reverse flow will be opposite to the positive velocity of
flow, i.e., a reverse fluid flow will occur and the mean fluid
velocity will decrease.
2. The increase in the positive velocity of the bars brings
about a larger mean fluid velocity.
3. The curve of wmean versus u shows a larger rate as A is
larger. Besides, a larger A will lead to an increase in f Re
when the bar moves adversely. However, a larger A will
cause a decrease in f Re under the positive velocity bars.
4. The coefficients An and Bm in velocities w1x ,y and
w2x ,y of the semi-analytical solution in this study can be

THE EFFECTS OF THE CROSS-SECTIONAL 
AREA AND ASPECT RATIO OF BEAMS ON A 
LAMINAR CHANNEL FLOW

ABSTRACT 
The study analyzed the fully developed laminar flow in a 
channel with longitudinal rectangular beams arrayed along the 
channel width.  The governing equations describing the fluid 
which flows along the direction of the beam length are ex-
pressed with double Poisson equations and are solved by ei-
genfunction-expansion and point-match method.  The effects 
of cross-sectional area and aspect ratio of the beams are in-
vestigated.  Dimensionless velocity profile, mean velocity, and 
friction factor multiplied by Reynolds number in the channel 
are presented for analysis.  Initially, a comparison of fRe for a 
special case is made.  It is found that the predicted fRe of this 
work tends to approach that of a parallel-plate channel case for 
smaller A and ar.  A further study shows that increasing the 
cross-sectional area of the beams will lead to a decrease both 
in the mean velocity and fRe values.  For a fixed cross-section 
area of the beam, as the beam height increases, an increase in 
the mean velocity and volumetric flow rate of the fluid but a 
decrease in the fRe is obtained. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The channel flow plays an important role in the research 
and analysis of fluid mechanics.  Nowadays, more and more 
attention has been engrossed on flow in a channel with rec-
tangular beams.  Practical engineering applications can be 
found in galvanizing and coating process on the bars, de-
signing a lubrication system, and cooling elements in a me-
chanical device.  The pressure drop in this process can be 
obtained from the calculation of flow velocity and friction 
factor in the channel.  Consequently, many significant efforts 
directed towards researches with related fields.  Sparrow and 
Loeffler [8] investigated the laminar flow between cylinders 
arranged in regular array by using the eigenfunction-expansion 
and point-matched method.  Their analytical solution was 
obtained for the longitudinal fully developed laminar flow 
between cylinders arranged in triangular of square array.  
Cheng [3] also presented an analog solution of laminar heat 
transfer in noncircular ducts by point-matching.  The fully 
developed laminar flow characteristics in noncircular ducts 
and the steady temperature distribution in infinitely long 
prismatic bars can be obtained.  Later, neglecting inertia effect, 
Trogdon and Joseph [9] solved the problem of plane flow of a 
second-order fluid over a rectangular slot by matching bior-
thogonal eigenfucntion expansions in different regions of flow.  
Besides, some other efforts directed studies towards a channel 
with various cross section such as a complex shaped duct or 
channel, in which the complicated regions might be decom-
posed into contiguous simpler sub-regions.  In 1976, Zarling 
[12] proposed the semi-analytical method to solve the gov-
erning equation for fully developed laminar flow through 
bars of complex geometrical pattern.  Employing the Schwarz- 
Neumann alternating method along with least squares point 
matching, the flow velocity in a duct with one pair of opposing 
walls being parallel plates and the adjacent pair of walls 
semicircular arcs was obtained.  In addition, the method was 
applied to a complex shaped duct and the resulting velocity 
was used to calculate the flow rate and pressure drop.  Mean- 
while, Wang [10] analyzed the parallel flow between two fixed 
corrugated plates, and discussed the dependence of flow rate 
on effect of wavy surface.  In 1994, Wang [11] further studied 
the laminar, viscous flow between parallel plates with evenly 
spaced longitudinal ribs.  The flow in a channel with longitu-
dinal ribs was solved by an eigenfunction-expansion and 
point–match method.  It was found that both the wetted pe-
rimeter and the friction factor-Reynolds number product are 
unsuitable parameters for the flow through ducts of complex 
geometry.  For a circular cylinder subject to a parallel-plate 
channel, Chen et al. [2] investigated the steady flow past this 
cylinder lost stability as the Reynolds number was increased.  
Furthermore, Bahrami et al. [1] investigated the fully-developed 
laminar flow in smooth channels of arbitrary cross-sections.  
For some selected channels, the fRe values were computed 
using existing analytical solutions for fluid flow.  Recently,

rewritten in the dimensionless form of Poisson equation: 
 
2 ( , ) 1w x y∇ = −  (3) 
Consider the domain with a period, 2H, and focused on the 
range from x = 0 to x = H, and y = 0 to y = aH, as shown in Fig. 
1(b).  The range is symmetric to y-axis in x = 0 and symmetric 
to x-axis in y = aH.  Due to symmetry, only one part of the 
channel, an L-Shaped region with two combined rectangles, as 
displayed in Fig. 2, is taken into account.  For convenience of 
reading and analysis, the L-shaped region in Fig. 1(b) is 
magnified into Fig. 2 with the height and width given in a 
dimensionless form.  The dimensionless governing equation 
for the left rectangle of the L-shaped domain is:

Next, the flow equation of the right rectangle in the 
L-shaped domain can be expressed as:

One more boundary condition for (4) is:

It should be pointed out that the traditional direct integral 
methods fail to solve the proposed problem on account of 
being short of the boundary condition in the range of 0 ≤ y < 
a – b.  However, the point-matched method can tackle this 
problem without much difficulty.  Subsequently, the velocity 
and the shear stress of the two rectangle regions of the L- 
shaped domain can be matched along the common boundary 
by using the point-matched method [4, 7].  The common 
boundary conditions are given as:

Figure 3 depicts the local velocity profile in the channel for 
a = 1.0, b = 0.5 and A = 0.25.  As can be clearly seen in the 
figures, the local velocities of the bottom and the top of the 
channel are all zero under the no-slip boundary conditions and 
the velocity gradually increases away from the fixed boundary.  
The maximum value of w falls on w1 and occurs at x = 0, y = a.  
In addition, the maximum w then gradually decreases to zero 
on the solid boundaries, i.e. the top and the bottom of the 
channel and the boundary of the beams.  At a fixed A, the local 
velocity between the two neighboring beams increases as the 
beam height increases.  This is due to the fact that spacing 
between beams becomes larger for a higher b.  Consequently, 
the boundary layer effect is smaller under this circumstance.  
To further explain this phenomenon, the local velocity distri-
bution in the channel for a = 1.0, b = 0.7 and A = 0.25 is given 
in Fig. 4.  Compared with Figs. 3 and 4, it is apparent that 
the maximum velocity for b = 0.7 is greater than that for b = 
0.5 at A = 0.25.  Also note that the velocity between the beam 
and the top or bottom plate is larger for a smaller beam height.  
This can be apprehended that the larger the spacing between 
beams is, the smaller the spacing between beam and top/ 
bottom plate of the channel will become at a fixed A.  For a 
larger b, the clearances between beams and plates are smaller 
and are almost completely subject to boundary layers which 
will reduce the flow velocity to a certain extent.  However, 
this phenomenon is alleviated for the beams with smaller b.  
This is because most of the fluid moves through the spacing 
between beams whereas smaller flow rate of the fluid passes 
the clearance between beam and top/bottom plate due to the 
fluid on different beam height and width under the same cross- 
sectional area of the beam.

obtained that (w1)max = 0.265 for b = 0.5 and (w1)max = 0.273 
for b = 0.7 under the conditions of A = 0.05 and a = 1.  A closer 
look of the comparison in (w1)max is illustrated in Fig. 6(c).  
Also, with the observations of Figs. 3 and 4, as b increases 
from 0.5 to 0.7, the maximum w1 varies from 0.117 to 0.170 
for A = 0.25 and a = 1.  Apparently, a larger cross-sectional 
area of the beam causes a decrease in w1 and then a smaller 
volumetric flow rate of the fluid is obtained.  In addition, an 
increase in the aspect ratio (i. e. increasing the height of beam, 
b) will cause an increase in w1 and a decrease in w2.  This is 
clearly seen in Fig. 6(d) that (w2)max = 0.036 for b = 0.5 and 
(w2)max = 0.012 for b = 0.7 under the conditions of A = 0.05 and 
a = 1.  Viewing the increase in (w1)max and the decrease in 
(w2)max on increasing ar, it is understood that the influence of 
w2 is quite insignificant.  Apparently, w1 is decisive in deter-
mining wmean and q; and in consequence an increase in ar will 
bring out an increase in both wmean and q. 
Figure 7 depicts the product of the friction factor and 
Reynolds number for different aspect ratios of beams with the 
same cross-sectional area.  It is shown that fRe decreases as 
the aspect ratio of the beam increases at a specified A.  Besides, 
an increase in the cross-sectional area of the beams will result 
in a decrease in the fRe at a given ar, as expected.  Note that 
there is an abrupt increase in fRe as ar approaches the critical 
ar for corresponding A, as pointed out in (21).  A locally 
maximum fRe occurs on the critical value ar.  Apparently, the 
maximum fRe is dependent of A.  For very small A and ar, the 
situation is just like the case of flow in a parallel-plate channel 
without any beams. 
Figure 8 shows the dependence of fRe on ar for smaller A.  
It is noted that the predicted fRe of the present study ap-
proaches the theoretical results obtained from a parallel-plate 
channel [5] for a smaller A as ar, tends to zero. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the foregoing 
results of this study: 
 
(1) In addition to fRe values, an increase in the beams’ 
cross-sectional area will lead to a decrease in the mean 
velocities and volumetric flow rates of the fluid in the 
channel. 
(2) For a fixed cross-sectional area of the beam, an increase in 
the height, b, will bring out an increase in the mean ve-
locity and volumetric flow rate of the fluid, but a decrease 
in the fRe. 
(3) The coefficients An and Bm in velocities w1(x, y) and w2(x, 
y)of the semi-analytical solution in this study can be more 
easily computed by the point match methods than that by 
the direct integral methods. 
(4) The predicted fRe of present study approaches the theo-
retical results obtained from a parallel-plate channel for 
smaller A and ar.
