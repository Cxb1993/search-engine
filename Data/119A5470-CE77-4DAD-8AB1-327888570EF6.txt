mechanical stability [14]. However, the 
disadvantage of thermal decomposition 
is that the conversion from the precursor 
solution including H2PtCl6 to metallic Pt 
takes place at a temperature at least 
380oC, thus excluding the choice of 
flexible plastic substrates [15]. 
Electrochemical methods have been 
considered as alternative approaches for 
Pt deposition, as these omit the 
requirement for vacuum equipment and 
high-temperature annealing treatment 
[14,16-23].   
Electrochemical deposition can be 
classified into two main methods: 
electrodeposition and electroless 
deposition (ELD). Unlike 
electrodeposition, ELD can be 
conducted without an external potential, 
and can also easily be scaled-up for the 
purposes of industrial development. 
Chen et al. [21] prepared Pt CEs through 
displacement reduction on metal sheets. 
The DSSC assembled with the Pt CE 
demonstrated high cell conversion 
efficiency of up to 7.29%. Unfortunately, 
the use of Pt loading was also as high as 
~487.5 μg cm-2. Moreover, the 
iodine-containing electrolyte could also 
corrode the metal substrates, thus posing 
problems in terms of reliability issue. 
Chen et al. [22] also prepared Pt CEs by 
ELD of Pt thin films on indium-doped 
tin oxide (ITO) substrates. They used a 
Pd catalyst on an ITO substrate to 
initiate Pt ELD and toxic hydrazine as a 
reductant in the deposition bath. The 
efficiency of the DSSC assembled with 
the ELD-Pt CE reached to 6.46%. 
Nevertheless, the loading of such Pt CE 
was still as high as ~487.5 μg cm-2.  
Additionally, Sn/Pd colloids 
activation is the common approach to 
active the substrate for electroless 
deposition. However, it is not suitable to 
deposit Pt on FTO surface because 
Sn/Pd could not link with FTO surface 
with electrostatic effect. Insufficient 
adhesion between catalytic layer and 
FTO glass would result in the ELD-Pt 
film with poor adhesion on FTO glass. 
Therefore, the Pt film may easily peel 
off and touch the TiO2 layer, resulting in 
drastic decrease in cell performance and 
eventually failure [23,24]. 
In this project, we modified the 
FTO glass surface by grafting 
3-(2-Aminoethylamino) propylmethyl- 
dimethoxysilane (Me-EDA-Si) 
self-assembly monolayers (SAMs), 
which can hydrolyze to form covalent 
bonding with FTO and its amino 
functional group can bind [PtCl6]2- ion 
through electrostatic interaction and 
serves as binder between the FTO glass 
and Pt activator. The detailed 
mechanism for Pt CEs prepared by 
means of SAM modification and ELD 
was further investigated in this project. 
In addition, the effects of bath 
formulation on the surface morphology, 
electrocatalytic activity of the Pt 
deposits, and the photovoltaic 
performance of the corresponding 
DSSCs were also examined. This Pt thin 
film prepared by electroless deposition 
under ambient temperature condition is 
promising, especially for large glass 
substrates or even flexible substrates.  
 
2. Experimental 
Preparation of Pt CEs 
Prior to ELD, the FTO transparent 
glasses (13Ω/□, Tripod technology Co.) 
were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially 
in detergent, acetone (Mallinckrodt 
Chemicals), and deionized water for 10 
min, respectively, and then stored in 
isopropyl alcohol (IPA, ECHO 
Chemicals) (cleaning step). A SAM of 
Me-EDA-Si (Aldrich) was formed on 
the FTO substrate by immersion in 1 
vol% Me-EDA-Si aqueous solution at 
ambient atmosphere for 10 min 
(coupling step) and then subjected to be 
rinsed with deionized water to remove 
excess silane molecules. Activation of 
the FTO substrate covered with SAM 
was carried out by immersion in an 
HCl-acidic solution containing 0.01 M 
4 
 
measurements.  
2.4 Cell assembly and photovoltaic 
performance 
The nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was 
made by referring to the previous 
literature [26] and the scattering TiO2 
paste was obtained from CCIC 
(Catalytic & Chemical Ind. Co., Ltd.). A 
bi-layer TiO2 anode composed of 12 μm 
nano-TiO2 and 2 μm scattering-TiO2 
was fabricated by using a 
semi-automatic screen printer (ATMA, 
AT45PA). After screening printing, the 
as-prepared TiO2 photoanodes with the 
active area of 0.283 cm2 were sintered at 
450 °C for 2 h and then cooled down to 
40 °C. Dye impregnation was performed 
by soaking the sintered TiO2 anode in an 
ethanol solution containing 0.3 mM 
N719 (Everlight Chemical Industry Co.) 
Ru-based dye for 4 h. The sensitized 
TiO2 anodes were assembled with 
various CEs by means of thermoplastic 
hot-melt surlyns (30 μm thick, Dupont) 
and the aforementioned electrolyte for 
EIS study was injected into the cells 
through the pre-drilled holes on CEs, 
which were further sealed after 
electrolyte injection. The 
photocurrent-voltage curves were 
recorded by a computer-controlled 
digital source meter (Keithely, model 
2400) under AM 1.5 (1 sun) illumination 
with a solar simulator (Yamashita Denso, 
YSS-150A). Each photovoltaic 
parameter presented is the average of 
five experimental values. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Characterization of Pt4+-activated 
SAMs 
Fluorescent microscope image of 
FITC-labeled Me-EDA-Si was shown in 
Fig. 1b; the successful immobilization of 
Me-EDA-Si on a FTO glass can be 
corroborated by the fluorescent pattern. 
The illuminating pattern is in shape 
contrast with the dark surrounding 
without SAMs modification by 
Me-EDA-Si. No illumination in the dark 
surrounding also indicates that there is 
no significant non-specific adhesion on 
the FTO surface. In addition, the finding 
that the amino group of Me-EDA-Si was 
labeled by FITC implies the amino 
group of Me-EDA-Si does not serve as 
the binding functional group with FTO 
surface.

Flourescence image of surface modified with 
Me-EDA-Si (bright area) and pure FTO surface (dark 
area) 
To further confirm the Pt-activated 
SAMs on FTO substrates, XPS analyses 
for the different steps were carried out in 
which high-resolution XPS spectra of N 
1s and Pt 4f peaks were recorded. Curve 
(a) in Fig. 2 presents the absence of the 
amino functional group (-NH2) 
corresponding to Me-EDA-Si, as the 
FTO substrates did not proceed the 
coupling step. However, a peak located 
at a binding energy of 399.3 eV was 
observed in curve (b) of Fig. 2, 
indicating the existence of -NH2 [27,28]. 
This also reveals that SAMs successfully 
formed on the FTO surface, which is in 
accordance with our previous 
observation by means of a fluorescent 
microscope. Curve (c) in Fig. 2 shows 
that a significant reduction of binding 
energy representing N 1s was observed 
for the Pt4+-activated FTO surface, 
which may possibly have resulted from 
the binding of –NH2 with Pt4+ [29]. Fig. 
3 presents the Pt 4f XPS spectra with 
different treatments. Curves (a) and (b) 
in Fig. 3 illustrate the XPS spectra of the 
FTO surfaces without the catalyzation 
process. As expected, no Pt4+ signals 
were recorded on the un-catalyzed 
surface. After the catalyzation step, the

than that of the sputtered-Pt CE. Of the 
ELD-Pt CEs, the CE prepared at pH 6 
had the highest Pt loading of 43.3 μg 
cm-2, while the CE prepared at pH 5 
possessed the lowest Pt loading of ~11.3 
μg cm-2, which is consistent with the 
SEM results. Fig. 5 presents the GIXRD 
results of the sputtered-Pt CE and 
ELD-Pt CEs prepared with different pH 
values. It is clear from these results that 
(111) texture is the dominant crystal 
orientation in the Pt CEs, regardless of 
the deposition process.

ELD-Pt deposits prepared at (b) pH 4, (c) pH 5, and (d) 
pH 6. The deposition bath composed of 1.0 mM 
H2PtCl6．6H2O, 0.5 M C6H5Na3O7．2H2O, and 0.3 M 
CHNaO2 was employed for the measurements. 
 
The regeneration of redox species 
I3- /I- is carried out through the reduction 
of I3- on the CEs of DSSCs. To 
investigate the electrocatalytic activity 
of CEs toward I3- reduction, EIS 
analyses were conducted with 
symmetric test cells. Fig. 6 represents 
the Nyquist spectra of the sputtered-Pt 
and ELD-Pt CEs. The semicircle at the 
high-frequency range corresponds to 
charge-transfer resistance (Rct), 
representing the electron-transfer 
resistance between the electrolyte and 
the CE. The impedance parameters 
(obtained by fitting the arc observed at 
higher frequencies in Nyquist plots 
(leftmost semicircle) to the equivalent 
circuit model shown in the inset of Fig. 
6) are also summarized in Table 1. In 
general, the lower Rct value indicates 
that electron transferability is more 
facile from the CE to I3-, thus 
demonstrating higher electrocatalytic 
activity for I3- reduction. In comparison 
with the sputtered-Pt CE, ELD-Pt CEs 
demonstrated impressive electrocatalytic 
activities with a much lower Pt loading. 
The ELD-Pt CE prepared at pH 4 
possessed the lowest Rct at 1.92 Ω‧cm2, 
which was lower than the 2.59 Ω‧cm2 
for the sputtered-Pt CE.  
8 
 
than that for the sputtered-Pt CE. These 
results indicate that the superior 
electrocatalytic activity toward I3- 
reduction of the ELD-Pt CE can be 
attributed to the higher active surface 
area (as the electrocatalytic activity 
depends on the active surface area of the 
catalyst). [6,14,31]. 
The photocurrent-voltage curves of 
DSSCs assembled with the sputtered-Pt 
CE and ELD-Pt CEs prepared at 
different pH are shown in Fig. 8. The 
resulting photovoltaic parameters are 
also summarized in Table 1. When 
comparing the DSSCs assembled with 
ELD-Pt CEs prepared at different pH 
values, the short circuit current (Jsc), fill 
factor (FF), and cell efficiency (η) 
values were found to decrease initially 
and then increase as the pH value of 
deposition bath increased. This tendency 
could possibly be attributed to the effect 
of electrocatalytic activity. CEs with the 
larger active surface areas can enhance 
the rate of I-/I3- redox reaction [6,14,31]. 
In addition, the lower Rct at 
CE/electrolyte interface can facilitate the 
electron transport from the CE to I3- ions, 
thus enhancing the Jsc or FF for DSSCs 
[18].  
 
Figure 8. Photocurrent density-voltage characteristics 
of DSSCs with sputtered-Pt CE and ELD-Pt CEs 
prepared at different pH values. 
Although the higher Pt loading for 
the ELD-Pt CE was prepared at pH 6, 
cell efficiency reached a maximum 
when the pH of the deposition bath was 
controlled at 4. It is noticeable that the 
DSSC using the ELD-Pt prepared at pH 
4 as the CE had the best photovoltaic 
performance with a Jsc of 14.12 mA cm-2, 
an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.784 V, 
and a FF of 0.64, thus yielding a η of 
7.07%. As for the DSSC assembled with 
the sputtered-Pt CE, the Jsc, Voc and FF 
were 13.07 mA cm-2, 0.765 V, and 0.62, 
respectively with a resultant η of 6.21%. 
The η value decreased dramatically with 
higher a Pt loading on the FTO surface, 
indicating that most of the Pt became 
useless due to Pt aggregation.  
After the optimization, the DSSC 
with ELD-Pt CE prepared at pH 4 with 
Pt concentration of 1 mM and reductant 
of 0.5 M exhibited the highest cell 
performance of 7.07%, which represents 
a increase on the DSSC using the 
sputtered-Pt CE, with much less Pt 
loading (being ~14.54% of that of the 
sputtered-Pt CE).  
 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, a Pt thin film was 
coated on a FTO glass substrate to form 
a low Pt-loading and high-performance 
Pt CE by means of a SAM modifier and 
a low-temperature ELD technique. 
Firstly, the mechanism for coupling and 
activation steps was successfully 
proposed. The cleaned FTO substrate 
was made to generate the –OH 
functional group on the FTO surface, 
and thus the silane compounds were able 
to anchor the -OH with a Si-O-Si bond 
to form SAMs. Thus, the -NH2 of the 
SAMs were able to further bind with the 
PtCl62- ion through electrostatic 
interaction. After the optimization of the 
bath formulation, the ELD-Pt CE 
prepared at pH 4 with 0.01 M H2PtCl6．
6H2O and 0.5 M C6H5Na3O7．2H2O of 
0.5 M had a lower Pt loading (15.91 μg 
cm-2), a higher active surface area (44.89 
m2 g-1) and lower charge-transfer 
resistance (1.92 Ω cm2) in comparison 
with that of the sputtered-Pt CE. The 
cell efficiency of the DSSC based on 
such an ELD-Pt CE reached 7.07% at 
AM 1.5 simulated full sunlight. The 
efficiency increased by 13.85% when
