1. Introduction 
Flow over a circular cylinder transversely oscillating beneath a free surface has 
many  realized and  potential applications in  the  design of  hydraulic, 
offshore,  and marine   structures,   underwater   vehicles   and   appendages,   
marine   pipelines   and water-based power plant. However, very little literature 
can be found on this subject. The present study aims to understand thoroughly and 
deeply this topic by systematically investigating effects of relevant parameters on 
hydrodynamic characteristics and flow structures involved in this physical process. 
Figure 1 shows the schematics of the present problem. Important dimensionless 
parameters include the normalized submergence depth, h/D, the normalized amplitude 
of oscillation, A/D, the frequency ratio, fe/fo, where fo denotes the vortex shedding 
frequency of flow over a deeply submerged fixed circular cylinder. Also, the Reynolds 
number, Re  ρ2UD/μ2 and the Froude number, Fr  U/(gD)
1/2
, influence flow 
characteristics as well. 
The two limiting cases of a fixed cylinder beneath a free surface (A = 0) and a deeply 
submerged oscillating cylinder (h = ∞) have been explored in a large amount of 
literature, however, the intermediate cases attracts much less interest of researchers. 
The literature and state-of-the-art of the research activity on the hydrodynamics of flow 
over a circular cylinder can be reviewed under three categories, that is, (1) fixed 
cylinder near a plane boundary; (2) fixed cylinder beneath a free surface; (3) deeply 
submerged oscillating cylinder; and (4) oscillating cylinder beneath a free surface. 
Fixed cylinder near a plane boundary 
For a fixed circular cylinder near a plane wall, the Reynolds number, gap ratio 
(analogous to the normalized submergence depth in the present study), and local 
boundary layer thickness on the plane wall, /D, willl influence the hydrodynamics, 
particularly the vortex shedding in the wake. Laboratory experiments on this issue were 
conducted by Bearman and Zdravkovich (1978), Taniguchi and Miyakoshi (1990), Lei 
et al. (1999), Wang and Tan (2008), and Lin et al. (2009). From these results, three 
modes of vortex shedding can be found at a given Reynolds number and a local 
boundary layer thickness, dependent on the gap ratio. At high h/D, the influence of 
plane wall is negligible and the vortex shedding has the same characteristics as that of 
an isolated cylinder; When h/D lowers down, periodic vortex shedding occurs only from 
the side of the cylinder which faces away from the plane boundary, with the quantitative 
characteristics affected by h/D; When h/D is further decreased smaller than the critical 
gap ratio, (h/D)cr, the periodic vortex shedding is suppressed.

force on the cylinder and the structure of the near wake. These three wake states agree 
with the wake structures reported in other experimental (Sheridan et al., 1997) and 
numerical (Reichl et al., 2005) study. The mode I wake is essentially a modified 
Kármán wake: the mode of vortex shedding is very similar to the deeply submerged 
case. However, the amplitude of the fluctuating lift force is larger than that of the latter 
case. The mode II and then mode III wakes occur when h/D decreases. The periodic 
vortex shedding appears to be suppressed and the lift varies little with time in these two 
modes. The flow over the top of the cylinder remains attached to and separates from the 
free-surface for the mode II and III respectively. In the mode III wake, the separated 
flow forms a jet which can either remain attached to the cylinder or flow downwards 
obliquely. 
Deeply submerged oscillating cylinder 
Many studies on flow over a cylinder subject to forced oscillation can be found in 
literature. The hydrodynamic forces (especially lift force) and wake structures for fe/fo 
near unity are two focuses of interest. On one hand, Bishop and Hassan (1963) found a 
simultaneous jump in the phase and amplitude of the lift force as fe/fo passes through 
unity. Then many researchers (Mercier, 1973; Staubli, 1983; Gopalkrishnan, 1993; 
Sarpkaya, 1995; Carberry et al., 2001; Carberry, 2002) have reported this phenomenon 
in a large amount of cases with different A/D and Re. On the other hand, over this range 
of frequency, Williamson and Roshko (1988), Gu et al. (1994), Carberry et al. (2001b), 
and Carberry (2002) have observed changes of the near-wake structure in terms of 
vortex shedding mode or timing. Carberry et al. (2001b) identified the correspondence 
of the lift-force jump to the wake-structure transition. Specifically, the low-frequency 
wake exhibits largely 2P mode, with two counter rotating pairs shed per oscillation 
cycle. Vortices in the high-frequency wake are shed in 2S mode, with two single 
vortices being shed per oscillation cycle. They have discussed in detail on the evolution 
of the low- and high-frequency wakes. 
Oscillating cylinder beneath a free surface 
To the author’s knowledge, this subject has received little attention. The only published 
work is performed by Carberry et al. (2004) who measured the span-averaged vertical 
force on the cylinder using strain gauges. The lift force was calculated by subtracting 
the time varying inertia force. The flow field was measured using laser scanning PIV. In 
all cases of their study, A/D = 0.5, Fr = 0.166, and Re = 2100, while 0.76 < fe/fo < 1.05. 
They considered three submergence depths, h/D = 3/16, 3/8, and 10. Their results were 
presented in terms of variation of lift phase with fe/fo and mean vorticity fields in the 
low- and high- frequency wake states, for three different submergence depths. The most 
important finding is the lift-phase jump at fe/fo ≈ 0.82 for various submergence depths 
considered. However, the vortex shedding appears to be inhibited but not eliminated 
when h/D decreases over the frequency range considered. For the flow and oscillation

Level Set Approach 
Surface Capturing and Property Smoothing 
Due to the rapid change of density and viscosity at the interface, there must be severe 
numerical diffusion when solving Eqs. (3) and (4) by traditional numerical schemes. 
In the present work the remedy is to capture the interface through the use of level set 
function (Sussman et al., 1994). Let  denote the level set function with positive value 
in fluid 1 and negative value in fluid 2, then the interface can be represented by the zero 
level set of  . For initializing , the signed normal distance to the interface will be 
assigned to the value of . Consider the following equation: 
   0t   u  (7) 
It shows that the zero level set will move in the same way as the interface does. Further, 
due to smoothness of , the above equation can be solved without problems caused by 
numerical instability. Then  and  can be obtained algebraically as

Solution of evolutionary equation of level set function 
The evolutionary equation of level set function, Eq. (7), can be solved in a similar 
manner as in the advection-diffusion step except  replacing u and discarding the 
viscous terms in Eq. (12). Meanwhile, the explicit option for the cell-face-center 
velocity in Eq. (13) is used. The process of reinitialization modifies   to 1n  , thus 
obtaining 
1n   and 1n   via Eq. (8). 
Solution of reinitialization equation of level set function 
To achieve high-order accuracy of spatial derivatives of the level set function without 
loss of numerical stability, we perform time integration by the second-order 
Runge-Kutta method and approximate the first-order derivatives in space by the 
second-order ENO scheme (Osher and Sethian, 1988). Further, according to Peng et al. 
(1998), numerical solution is confined in a region close to the interface to save on 
computational cost. Usually the region is chosen as within four-mesh sizes away from 
the interface. 
Cut cell approach 
We implement boundary conditions on imbedded solid-body surface by the cut cell 
approach. Details of cell merging, interpolation strategy at cut-cell-face center, and 
moving-body related modifications can be found in Chung (2006). Please refer to 
Chung (2008, 2009, 2010b) for more applications.

4. Numerical results 
4.1 Validation by a fixed circular cylinder 
As a validation case, we have performed simulation of flow over a fixed circular 
cylinder placed beneath a free surface with h = 0.4 at Fr = 0.3 and Re = 180. Figures 2 
and 3 present respectively the subblocks of grid in the whole computational domain and 
in the proximity of cylinder at t = 100. The hierarchies of mesh span six levels with a 
minimum mesh size of 0.01953125 close to the cylinder and the free surface. The total 
number of meshes comes to around 104,000 at this instant. Figure 4 illustrates the 
calculated coefficients of drag and lift as function of time. Note that the buoyancy force 
has been excluded from the calculation of lift force. The regular vortex shedding is not 
suppressed in this case. The variation of drag is weaker than that of lift. Nonzro 
(negative) mean lift reflects the influence of the free surface. Discrete Fourier 
Transform of the lift data gives a Strouhal number of 0.182. 
Both Reichl et al. (2005) and Bozkaya et al. (2011) have numerically simulated this 
case using the commercial software package, FLUENT. Table 1 lists comparison 
between the present and their results. The quantity, uˆ , is the streamwise velocity 
averaged over the local free surface height, 
L
h , in the region directly above the 
cylinder when maximum lift occurs. The local Froude number is defined as 
 F
L
L
u
r
g h
  (28) 
where u  is the maximum streamwise velocity in the region directly above the cylinder 
when the lift reaches its maximum. We have to point out that Reichl et al. (2005) 
defined the local Froude number based on the undisturbed free surface height, h, and a 
measure of velocity through the gap which was not precisely defined in their paper. In 
brief, the present study predicts the same local Froude number as that of Bozkaya et al. 
(2011) but a 9% lower average velocity than those of the two previous works.

0.4 at fe/fo = 2.5. The left plot of Fig. 11 shows the calculated coefficients of drag and 
lift as function of time. Comparison among each left plot of Figs. 7, 10, and 11 gives the 
observation that both the mean and variation of the drag abruptly increase when the 
oscillation amplitude goes beyond the submergence depth. However, the variation 
amplitude of lift increases linearly with the oscillation amplitude. 
Finally, to investigate the hydrodynamic forces for a larger Froude number, we 
performed a simulation of the case with Fr = 0.6, A = 0.4, and h = 0.4 at fe/fo = 2.5. The 
right plot of Fig. 11 shows the calculated coefficients of drag and lift as function of time. 
Comparison with the left plot of Fig. 10 shows that the variation amplitudes of both the 
drag and lift are larger for higher Froude number and that undulatory envelopes of the 
force curves appear for Fr = 0.6, implying existence of flow structures more 
complicated than for Fr = 0.3. 
5. Conclusions 
In this proposal, hydrodynamic forces and wake-vortex structures of uniform flow over 
a transversely oscillating circular cylinder beneath a free surface will be investigated by 
computational fluid dynamics. 
This project has studied the hydrodynamics of uniform flow over a transversely 
oscillating circular cylinder beneath a free surface. Each of the four parameters, 
submergence depth, oscillation amplitude, oscillation frequency, and Froude number, 
plays an important role in determining the hydrodynamics, especially the amplitude of 
the drag/lift variation. In particular, the oscillation frequency has the most pronounced 
effect. In the future, effects on the frequency of the drag/lift variation will be carefully 
investigated, along with corresponding vortex structures in the wake. Definitely, 
Reynolds number effect will also be studied.

This study provides similar research communities with valuable information on the 
dynamic responses of structure transversly oscillating near a free surface. Related 
studies, either numerical or experimental, have hardly been found in the literature. We
