2一、 中文摘要
中文關鍵字: 兆赫波、光纖、分子影像、生物感測
輻射頻率介在0.1~3 兆赫的電磁波在過去鮮少被拿來做研究，但是近來由於在此頻段的產生波源以及
分析技術上的進步，再加上美國在反恐怖研究經費上的大幅增加，均刺激研究者從事此類應用上的研
究。兆赫波(通常又稱為T-rays)係介於微波和紅外光之間的電磁輻射。它可以穿透不透明的紙和布，並
且和金屬及生物分子作用，使得隱藏在布料下的物體可以藉著兆赫波成像術被彰顯出來。一般生物分
子皆具有豐富的轉動和振動能階，該能階頻率分佈係介於0.1到10兆赫之間(相當於波長3000 微米到30
微米之間)。由於不同的生物分子會吸收不同的兆赫波頻率，因此兆赫波可成為先進生物分子影像與感
測技術，可在無外加標定物的情況下，直接辨識生物分子。
在國科會工程處贊助下，本實驗室成功展出兩種兆赫波光纖，除有高紀錄的耦合效率外，其傳輸損耗
也小於0.01cm-1，甚至達到前所未有之0.001cm-1。本計畫之目標，在基於過去發展兆赫波光纖之成果，
開發出光纖化之兆赫波影像與感測系統。 本計畫之完成，除成功建立各式兆赫波光纖化基礎技術，並
大幅提升各式兆赫波應用之可靠度，使兆赫波技術成為實用之生物科技技術。
二、 英文摘要
英文關鍵字: THz, fiber, molecular imaging, bio-sensing.
For years, radiation with a frequency of between 0.1 THz and 3 THz languished unexplored. But recent
advances in generating and analyzing such radiation, together with an avalanche of US research funding for
antiterror applications, are now helping researchers to examine its applications. Terahertz radiation, often
called T-rays, lies between microwaves and infrared light in the electromagnetic spectrum. It can penetrate
through optically opaque paper and clothing, but interact with metal and biological molecules, so objects
hidden beneath clothing can be revealed by THz imaging. Bio-molecules have a rich spectrum of vibrational
and rotational transitions those lie in the range of 100GHz-10THz (3000μm-30μm). Because biological
molecules absorb different frequencies of terahertz radiation, T-ray imaging should thus be treated as the
genuine “molecular imaging” technique.
Under the support of NSC, we have previously successfully demonstrated two different types of THz PE
fibers with a record high coupling efficiency and record low attenuation loss on the order or lower than 0.001
cm-1. Based on these novel findings, in this project, we focus on the development of fiber based THz imaging
and sensing systems. The success of this continuous program not only laid the foundation for fiber-based THz
techniques, but also enhanced the reliability of future THz imaging and sensing systems, just like optical fiber
based systems, and will flourish future THz applications toward biomedical researches.

五、文獻探討
Recent advances in generating and analyzing THz radiation, together with an avalanche of US research
funding for antiterror applications, are now helping researchers to examine its imaging applications. For
Taiwan, there are already several groups working on optical generation of THz radiations. However most
other groups were working on the time domain terahertz spectroscopy. We were the only group working on
the CW domain. Prof. C.-L. Pan (潘犀靈) at 交通大學 was also working on the T-ray imaging but with a
time-domain approach. Our work would provide mutual benefits to each other.
With the perspective on a compact, reliable, and flexible THz system for various applications, a low-loss THz
waveguide is essential. Recently, many metal-based waveguiding techniques, including metal parallel plate [1]
and bare metal wire [2,3], were reported to have a much improved attenuation constant compared to other
conventional microwave waveguides [4,5] and various dielectric-based waveguides [6-9]. Even though the
current reports show that the metal–based guiding technique is the best solution that meets the need of low
attenuation, under the NSC support, our subwavelength fiber [10] and air-core microstructure fiber [11] are
with the same order of attenuation constant compared with the best reported metal wires, but with a much
improved coupling efficiency.
For fiber-scanning THz imaging, it had not been demonstrated before the start of this NSC project. The
success of this program willensure Taiwan’s leadership in THz fiber based system development. Comparable
works were only done with optical fiber scanning THz images by integrating a photonic transmitter with an
optical fiber [12]. However the system was not only complicated, but also the system can’temit strong THz
radiation due to not only low efficiency photonic transmitter adopted, but also due to the fact that high optical
power will make optical pulses suffer from strong fiber nonlinearity-induced distortion.
Suffering from the long wavelength, far field THz imaging system has a resolution worse than the applied
wavelength, thus are on the order of mm. To improve it resolution down to nanometers for single molecule
detection, near field technique has to be applied. Most THz near field works adopted a pinhole to enhance the
resolution down to the order of tens of or several microns [13-15]. It was found that the frequency dependent
transmission of the broad band pulses through the pinhole changes the spectral and temporal characteristics of
the short THz pulse [16]. Previously by adopting the apertureless near field technique, a spatial resolution of
150 nm was demonstrated by an RPI group [17]. Our developed fiber-based near field system was a
modification of previous systems, with a fiber for THz waveguiding, similar to current near-field optical
microscopes.

THz ARROW Pipe Waveguide (Optics Letters 34, 3457-3459 (2009); Optics Express 18, 309-322 (2010))
Our previous study on microstructure fibers [11] indicated that, instead of using complicated ring structure, a
simplified structure –a pipe, can guide THz efficiently. Under this program, we further demonstrated that a
simple plastic pipe, such as the common water or air pipes, can successfully confine the THz waves in the
central air core with a reasonably low attenuation constant on the order of or lower than 0.001cm-1. Very
different from previous air-core waveguides, the circular plastic pipe walls are a single-layer structure with a
relatively low but uniform refractive index. High coupling efficiency and broad bandwidth are simultaneously
achieved.
Figure 1. We proposed and demonstrated a very simple THz pipe (PMMA, Teflon, PP, glass) waveguide with an air core for leaky
mode THz waveguiding. Using commercially available Teflon air pipes, we experimentally confirm that THz waves can be
successfully guided in the central air core with excellent mode qualities. Low attenuation constants can be achieved to be on the
order of or lower than 0.001cm-1. As the measured pipe is non-uniform, wall-thickness variation is assumed for simulation and
excellent agreement with the theory can be found. [Optics Letters 34, 3457-3459 (2009)]

Subwavelength Dielectric-Fiber-Based THz Coupler (Journal of Lightwave Technology 27, 1489-1495
(2009))
Under this program, we demonstrated a THz directional coupler for future THz applications including THz
power dividers, THz communications, and THz fiber-endoscopes. By using subwavelength polyethylene
fibers, we successfully established a single-mode fiber-based THz directional coupler. Unlike traditional
directional couplers, the demonstrated subwavelength directional fiber coupler showed less dependency on the
overlapped length of two fibers and the delivered THz frequency in our interested minimal-attenuation
wavelength regime. By tuning the geometry, we also showed the feasibility to control the coupling ratio.

Reflection Type THz Fiber Endoscope (Optics Express 16, 2494-2501(2008))
Under this program, we demonstrated a new reflective imaging technique using continuous-wave THz
fiber-endoscopy, in which the sample was placed behind the output of a THz subwavelength plastic fiber and
the Fabry Perot interference was formed therein. 3D THz reflective images with a reasonable SNR as well as
high lateral and subwavelength axial resolutions were acquired by moving the sample along the axial (z)
direction and by 2D scanning the output end of the subwavelength plastic fiber without any focusing medium.
By analyzing the axial-position dependent THz signals backward collected by the subwavelength plastic fiber,

Sub-Wavelength THz Fiber Based Frequency Domain RADAR (Optics Letters 35, 1344-1346 (2010))
Jointly supported by the “使用兆赫波內視鏡檢測癌症的活體動物實驗,”we have developed the THz
imaging system based on the frequency domain RADAR principle which can obtain a two dimensional THz
radar image in 7 seconds by rotating the parabolic mirror accompany with fast sweeping THz frequency. The
sweep time for the entire 35GHz (108-143GHz) bandwidth can be as fast as 50ms. This is the first ever THz
imaging system adopting a principle similar to OCT (optical coherent tomography).

mouse but also show the movement of the mouse from the first floor to the third floor inside the box. The rightmost photographs
show the actual locations of the mouse. [Optics Letters 35, 1344-1346 (2010)]

Fiber Scanning Near-Field THz Microscope (Optics Letters 34, 1084-1086 (2009))
Jointly supported by the “使用兆赫波內視鏡檢測癌症的活體動物實驗,”under this program, we
successfully established a compact all-THz fiber-scanning near-field microscope operating at
room-temperature. The upright-type THz near-field microscope has a compact size, capable of being
integrated with an optical microscope. This is realized by using a plasmon-resonance enhanced THz
subwavelength pinhole. Our study indicated that this transmission illumination near-field system could be a
promising tool to distinguish breast cancer from the normal tissue without pathologic staining.

for wire bonding. In addition, the THz wave reflected from the metal layer can constructively interfere with
the wave on the antenna and enhance the radiation in the air. Under the design as shown in Fig. 16, combining
with a recent developed hollow core waveguide, a fiber-output THz photonic transmitter is to be realized.
Figure 16. The geometry of the circuit is completely designed. The simulated return loss and the radiation pattern are shown above.
The resonant frequency is designed at 650 GHz. The fabrication of the device is in progress.
It is important to notice that our work on the new photonic transmitter was recently selected as the
cover for IEEE Photonics Technology Letters for May-June 2008 issue.
