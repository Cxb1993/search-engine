Abstract: Antenna effect is a phenomenon in the plasma-based nanometer process. The metal wire directly exposed to plasma may 
accumulate sufficient charges to damage thin gate oxide and furthermore influence chip reliability. This work proposes a 
discharge-path-based antenna detection and fixing with jumper insertion algorithm for X-architecture clock tree. The layer 
assignment technique is integrated with the proposed algorithm to reduce inserted jumpers. Given an X-clock tree with n clock sinks, 
layer configuration, and the upper bound of antenna effect, the proposed algorithm named PADJI can run in O(n2) to achieve antenna 
violation free and consider via timing impact caused by jumper insertion during skew compensation. In terms of number of inserted 
jumpers, clock delay, power consumption, and required total via cost listed in the experimental results on benchmarks, PADJI can 
fix antenna violations and achieves improvements of 48.21%, 0.0242%, 0.0186%, and 20.36%, respectively, compared with other 
jumper insertion method for X-clock routing. 
Keywords: Antenna effect, clock tree, design for manufacturability, jumper insertion, layer assignment, X-architecture routing. 
I. Introduction 
With the continuous and rapid increasing complexity of very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) designs in present 
nanometer fabrication technologies, product reliability and manufacturing yield have become important issues in design 
and manufacture fields [1-2]. The fine feature size of modern IC technology is typically achieved by using 
plasma-based processes. In nanometer era, more stringent process requirements cause some advanced high-density 
plasma reactors applied in the production lines for achieving fine-line patterns. However, the plasma-based process 
contains a potential behavior to charge conducting components of fabricated structures. The announced experimental 
results report that the accumulated charges may affect the quality of thin gate oxide [3]. This phenomenon is called an 
antenna effect or a plasma-induced gate-oxide damage. 
During wafer manufacturing, the metal wire not covered by a shielding layer of oxide is directly exposed to plasma 
and accumulates sufficient charges to affect the quality of thin gate oxide. Chen and Koren [4] proved that the amount 
of such charging is proportional to the plasma-exposed area and they also defined the ratio of plasma-exposed area, 
As,metal, to gate-oxide area, Apoly, as an antenna ratio, AR, to predict the antenna effect. The definition of AR is given as 
follows.

area oxide-gate
area exposed-plasma ,
th
poly
metals k
A

AR ≤==  (1) 
where kth is the threshold of AR.  
For a metal wire with width wM, length, lM, and thickness tM, as shown in Fig. 1(a), As,metal and Apoly are defined as 
2(wM+lM)tM and wMlM, respectively. According to TSMC 0.18µm technology file [5], the required kth is 400 and the 
upper bound of antenna effect, Lmax, can be derived as 200µm. If the length of a metal wire or the accumulated length of 
concatenate metal wires is longer than Lmax, an antenna violation will be occurred. Thus, the upper bound could be a 
limited length, a limited exposed area, a ratio of antenna strength (length or area) to gate-oxide area, or a model of 
antenna strength caused by conductors.

II. Problem Formulation 
In order to detect and fix antenna violations, the metal wires those not only connect gates but also collect charges are 
the discharge paths and should be visited. Next, the total lengths of discharge paths are compared with the upper bound 
of antenna effect, Lmax. The objective of this work is to detect antenna violations with discharge paths in a given 
X-clock tree, and then, all the violations are fixed with minimum number of inserted jumpers. After inserting jumpers, a 
wire sizing technique is used to compensate clock skew. This work applies PMXF algorithm [21] to construct the initial 
clock tree based on X-architecture [22]. In the layer configuration of the adopted X-architecture, the horizontal and 
vertical wires are assigned with metal 1 (M1) and metal 2 (M2), as well as, ±45° wires are assigned with metal 3 (M3) 
and metal 4 (M4), respectively. 
Figure 3 illustrates antenna effect and fixes antenna violation with jumper insertion. A part of clock tree based on 
X-architecture is shown in Fig. 3(a) and si and sj are clock sinks. A sink is the clock input port of a standard cell or an 
IP (intellectual property). PB(si, sj) is the bending point and one or two more vias are inserted at the point to connect 
different metal layers. PT(si, sj) is the tapping point [23] of si and sj for determining zero skew property of clock tree. 
Figure 3(b) is the cross-section view of Fig. 3(a) and two discharge paths, DP1 and DP2, through clock sinks, si and sj, 
respectively, are presented.

inserted to fix antenna violation, and (d) the cross-section view of (c). 
During metallization, chips are usually manufactured “layer-by-layer.” When a metal interconnect is being 
assembled, it will contain several pieces of metals. Long interconnects act as temporary capacitors and accumulate 
charges gained from the energy provided during fabrication steps such as plasma etching or chemical mechanical 
polishing (CMP). When a long metal connects a thin gate oxide or clock sink, the accumulated charges will be 
discharged through the discharge path of clock sink. Meanwhile, if the length of DP is longer than Lmax, the clock sink 
that DP flows through will be damaged. As shown in Fig. 3(b), DP1 is the discharge path of si. The accumulated length 
of si, Lacu(si), is the sum of the lengths of segments 9-12 due to metal 4 is the topmost layer, Ltop, of DP1. When a sink 
directly connects the topmost layer of discharge path, like si, this sink will not surfer antenna damage [9]. In contrast, sj 
has another discharge path, DP2, and Lacu(sj) is the sum of the lengths of segments 1-4 due to metal 4 is Ltop of DP2. 
Because Lacu(sj) is longer than Lmax, sj has antenna violation. Hence, this work applies the technique illustrated in Fig. 
2(a) to insert a jumper on a wire connecting sj to reduce the length of effective conductor associated with sink sj. Fig. 
3(c) shows that a jumper is inserted on the wire connecting sj and PB(si, sj) to break the original discharge path. Here, 
the distance between sj and the inserted jumper is Lmax. Figure 3(d) is the cross-section view of Fig. 3(c). After inserting 
a jumper, DP2 can be shortened to the sum of the lengths of segments 1-3. Segments 5 and 6 will not collect charges 
due to they are floating [9]. As aforementioned, jumpers are implemented with vias which will consume extra routing 
resource and increase delay time. Therefore, it is desired to minimize the number of inserted jumpers during fixing 
antenna violations. 
Based on the above discussion, this work visits each sink in the given X-clock tree and then determines how many 
sinks have antenna violations with their discharge paths. Next, jumpers are inserted on the metal wires to fix all the 
antenna violations and the number of inserted jumpers should be minimized. Thus, the problem of antenna detection 
and fixing for an X-clock routing can be formulated as follows. 
Given an X-clock tree with a set of n clock sinks, S={s1, s2, …, sn}, layer configuration, and the upper bound of 
antenna effect Lmax, the objective of this work is to detect and fix antenna violations in the given X-clock tree with 
jumper insertion and maintain zero skew. 
III. Delay Model of Metal Wire with Via Timing Impact Consideration 
Elmore delay (ED) model [24] is widely applied to calculate wire delay for clock tree construction. The equivalent 
circuit of a wire ei with width wi and length li based on ED model is shown in Fig. 4(a), where r and ca denote the sheet 
resistance and the unit area capacitance, respectively. Because ED model may overestimate wire delay and limit 
accuracy, fitted Elmore delay (FED) model [25] is alternately proposed. Figure 4(b) shows the equivalent circuit of ei 
based on FED model, where cf is the fringing capacitance. 
The delay of ei connecting a load capacitance, CL,i, at sink i based on ED and FED models are respectively

IV. Discharge-Path-Based Antenna Detection and Fixing with Jumper Insertion 
In order to detect and fix antenna effects, the proposed algorithm is presented in Fig. 5 and named PADJI 
(discharge-path-based antenna effect detection and fixing with jumper insertion). For a given X-clock tree with a set of 
n clock sinks, S={s1, s2, …, sn}, layer configuration, and the upper bound of antenna effect Lmax, the objective of this 
work is to detect antenna effect with discharge paths and then fix antenna violations with minimum number of inserted 
jumpers and zero skew. 
Algorithm: PADJI () /*Discharge-path-based effect antenna detection and fixing with jumper insertion */

2  {  if( e(si).layer = the Ltop of layer configuration )
3      { si is antenna violation free. }
4      else
5      {  DP(si) = DischargePath(si);  /* Obtain a set of discharge paths of si, DP(si) */
6          for each dpk in DP(si)
7          {  etotal(si) = etotal(si) + dpk – Duplicate(∀em∈dpk, etotal(si));
/* Obtain a set of segments those accumulate charges and may damage si. */
8              if( |etotal(si)| ≥ Lmax )
9              {  InsertJumper(si);  /* Insert a jumper to fix antenna violation occurred on si. */
10                break;
11            }

Fig. 5. The proposed PADJI algorithm. 
The proposed PADJI algorithm consists of several procedures in a for loop, and its overview is given as follows. For 
each sink si ∈ S in the given X-clock tree, if the layer of a metal wire connecting si is the top layer, Ltop, of layer 
configuration, si is antenna violation free; otherwise, the proposed algorithm will detect each discharge path of si. The 
DischargePath procedure visits all the discharge paths those relate si and then obtains a set of discharge paths, DP(si), 
which may collect charges to damage si. Next, the proposed algorithm moves the metal wires of each discharge path, 
dpk, into the accumulated wires of si, etotal(si). The length of etotal(si), |etotal(si)|, is used to estimate the violation of 
antenna effect. Because each dpk may contain several pieces of edges, em, the duplicate edge is excluded to avoid length 
overestimation and unnecessary jumper insertion. If |etotal(si)| is equal to or longer than Lmax, the InsertJumper(si) 
procedure will insert a jumper to fix the antenna violation of si. Finally, the WireSizing (si) procedure is employed to 
adjust the width of wire connecting si for skew compensation. After introducing the overview, each procedure will be 
described in the following subsections in detail. 
Discharge-Path-based Antenna Detection － DischargePath() 
For a pair of sinks si and sj in a part of X-clock tree shown in Fig. 6(a), the DischargePath procedure visits all the 
discharge paths relating the given sink si and collects charges along the edges of si into a set of discharge paths DP(si) 
for calculating the total accumulated lengths. Figure 6(b) illustrates the tree topology of Fig. 6(a) based on binary tree 
structure to model the X-clock tree. For calculating the number of inserted vias and estimating clock delays in an 
X-clock tree, this work adopts two via definitions proposed in [27]. When a via belongs to an internal node or a leaf 
node in a binary X-clock tree, the via is defined as a node via, NV, such as the square dots in Fig. 6(b). The number of 
NVs is equal to the difference of the highest and lowest metal layers. When a via locates at a bending point of a tree 
edge, the via is defined as an edge via, EV, such as the triangle dots in Fig. 6(b). The number of EVs is counted by the 
difference of metal layers assigned in the tree edge.

Based on the properties of binary X-clock tree shown in Fig. 6(b), sink sj is si’s brother and denoted as B(si). The 
tapping point of si and sj is their father and denoted as F(si). The bending point of si and sj (also called B(si)) is denoted 
as PB(B(si),si). For applying discharge paths to detect antenna effect, this work also defines the connecting edges and 
their layer as follows. The edge connecting si and PB(B(si),si) is denoted as e(si) and the layer of e(si) is denoted as 
e(si).layer; the edge connecting B(si) and PB(B(si),si) is denoted as e(B(si)) and the layer of e(B(si)) is denoted as 
e(B(si)).layer; the edge connecting F(si) and its bending point PB(B(F(si)),F(si)) is denoted as e(F(si)). The layer of 
e(F(si)) is denoted as e(F(si)).layer. Figure 6(c) is the cross-section view of Fig. 6(a). Because e(si).layer is M3, the 
number of NVs locating on si is three for connecting poly layer up to M3. Moreover, the number of EVs locating on 
PB(B(si), si) is two for connecting M1 up to M3 due to e(B(si)).layer and e(si).layer are M1 and M3 respectively. 
 7
and 10. Here, the length of each segment is X-architecture distance not Manhattan distance. Therefore, |etotal(s13)| is the 
sum of the lengths of segments 5-8 and 10 whereas the duplicate segments have been removed. Moreover, the lengths 
of segments 5, 7, and 10 can be ignored due to they are metallised for vias. Finally, |etotal(s13)| can be simplified as the 
sum of the lengths of segments 6 and 8. Note that the lengths of segments 6 and 8 are equal to |e(s13)| and |e(s23)|, 
respectively. For the other sink s14, it directly connects M3 which is the Ltop of dp1 in DP(s14) and has no antenna 
violation. Because |etotal(s13)| is longer than Lmax and antenna violation is occurred, a jumper is inserted to break the 
original segment 6 shown in Fig. 8(c) into two segments 6 and 9 shown in Fig. 8(d). It is obvious that the length of | 
etotal(s13)| is short enough to avoid antenna violation. For sinks s9 and s10, another jumper is also inserted on e(s10) to fix 
antenna violation.

Adjust Wire width after Jumper Insertion － WireSizing() 
After inserting jumpers to fix antenna violations, clock skew is another occurred side-effect in X-clock tree. Hence, 
the proposed algorithm applies a wire sizing technique to achieve zero skew. As shown in Fig. 9(a), a pair of sinks (s13, 
s14), their tapping point s23, and an inserted jumper are taken as an example to explain the WireSizing procedure. After 
inserting a jumper to fix the antenna violation of s13, the number of required vias of s13, #via13, is increased from 1 to 3 
(see the physical structure in Fig. 8(d)). via13 includes one NV on s13 and two vias belong to the inserted jumper. 
Therefore, the wire e(s23, s13) connecting the tapping point s23 and sink s13 should be sized to achieve zero skew.

Fig. 9(b) shows the equivalent model of Fig. 9(a) for explaining how to derive the width of e(s23, s13). First, s14 is 
antenna violation free without jumper insertion, therefore, the number of vias of s14, #via14, is fixed and can be counted 
as the sum of three NVs on sink s14 and two EVs on bending point. Meanwhile, Delay(s23, s14) based on the ED model 
can be calculated by (7). Next, we formulate Delay(s23, s13) and force the two delays to be equal to each other for 
deriving the width of e(s23, s13), w13, as follows.

In order to clearly demonstrate the difference between JI and PADJI algorithms, this work takes two sinks s7 and s8 
extracted from Fig. 10 as an example and presents the local views and cross-section views of X-clock routings 
constructed and fixed by PMXF, JI, and PADJI, respectively in Fig. 11. Figure 11(a) shows the local view of a pair of 
sinks, (s7, s8), in the initial X-clock tree constructed with PMXF and its cross-section view is shown in Fig. 11(d). 
Here, JI algorithm is first discussed as follows. When a sink connects the Ltop of layer configuration, JI thinks that the 
sink is antenna violation free. In contrast, if the sum of total lengths of wires connecting a sink is longer than Lmax, JI 
will insert a jumper connecting the Ltop of layer configuration to fix the violation. In this example, JI takes M4 as Ltop. 
In Fig. 11(d), JI derives that the accumulated length of s7, |etotal(s7)|, is the sum of the lengths of segments 5-7. Because 
segments 5 and 7 are short enough to be ignored, Table I lists that |etotal(s7)| is approximated as the length of segment 6 
as 2110µm. Due to |etotal(s7)| is longer than Lmax, JI inserts a jumper to fix the antenna violation of s7, as shown in Fig. 
11(b). Moreover, the cross-section view of Fig. 11(b) is presented in Fig. 11(e). The jumper inserted on s7 can shorten 
the length of |etotal(s7)| but need three vias to connect segments 8 and 11, as well as, other three vias to connect segments 
11 and 9, respectively. For the other sink s8, |etotal(s8)| is the sum of the lengths of segments 1-4 and approximated as the 
length of segment 4 as 1695.6µm, as listed in Table I. JI also inserts another jumper to fix the antenna violations of s8, 
due to |etotal(s8)| is longer than Lmax. As shown in Fig. 11(e), the jumper inserted on segment 4 can also shorten the 
length of |etotal(s8)| but need two extra vias to connect segments 4-5 and segments 5-6, respectively. Finally, JI totally 
inserts two jumpers to fix antenna violations and consumes extra eight vias for the pair of sinks (s7,s8).

Fig. 11. Take s7 and s8 as an example. (a) The local view of X-clock tree with antenna violations, (b) two jumpers required by JI are inserted to fix 
antenna violations of (a), (c) only one jumper is required and inserted by PADJI. (d) The cross-section view of (a), where s7 and s8 respectively 
contain two and one discharge path, (e) the cross-section view of (b), and (f) the cross-section view of (c). 
Second, the proposed PADJI algorithm is discussed as follows. As shown in Fig. 11(d), sinks s7 and s8 respectively 
have two and one discharge path. For sink s7, the first discharge path of s7, dp1 of DP(s7), consists of segments 5-7 and 
the second one, dp2 of DP(s7), consists of segments 6-8. Segment 8 connecting s20 and PB(s19,s20) may collect charges to 
damage s7. However, the segment is not visited and included by JI when detecting s7. For sink s8, the top layer of 
segments connecting s8 is M3 and the discharge path of s8, dp1 of DP(s8), only contains segments 1-3. Hence, segment 
4 is overestimated by JI when detecting s8. Moreover, the jumper inserted on s8 should be removed. As aforementioned, 
that is the reason PADJI detects each discharge path of a given sink to precisely obtain its accumulated length for 
determining antenna violation. 
For a paired of sinks s7 and s8, and s20, their bending point and tapping point s20are respectively denoted as B(s7) and 
F(s7). As shown in Fig. 11(a), e(s7).layer is M1 and e(B(s7)).layer is M3, hence, the DischargePath procedure in PADJI 
can obtain that Ltop(s7) is M3 and s7 satisfies the condition of Case3. Next, e(F(s7)).layer is M2 and F(s7) not only 
satisfies the interval constraint of [M1, M3) but also locates on e(s7). Hence, the procedure inserts e(s7) into DP(s7) and 
gives F(s7) to the DischargePath procedure for determining extra edges. In the DischargePath(F(s7)) (or 
DischargePath(s20) ) procedure, e(s20).layer is M2, e(B(s19)).layer is M3, and e(F(s26)).layer is M1. Therefore, s20 also 
satisfies the condition of Case3 and DischargePath(F(s20)) returns e(s20). Therefore, PADJI obtains that DP(s7) contains 
e(s7) and e(s20), as well as, |etotal(s7)| can be approximated as the sum of |e(s7)| and |e(s20)| as 5607.7µm. Here, e(s7) and 
e(s20) are segments 6 and 8, respectively. For sink s8, the DischargePath procedure in PADJI gets that s8 satisfies the 
condition of Case1 and has no antenna violation. Finally, PADJI inserts only one jumper to fix the antenna violation of 
s7 as shown in Fig. 11(c). The cross-section view of Fig. 11(c) is presented in Fig. 11(f) that the inserted jumpers just 
need two extra vias for connecting M2. Compared with JI algorithm, the proposed PADJI algorithm takes less inserted 
jumpers and vias to fix antenna violations. 
Table II lists the experimental results on the 16-sink X-clock trees respectively constructed and fixed by PMXF, JI, 
and PADJI algorithms in terms of the number of inserted jumpers, delay, skew, power, and total vias. Note that the

The overview of PADJILA is given as follows. To simplify the presentation, we just discuss how to fix the 
antenna-critical sink with jumper insertion and layer assignment method (lines 8-16 of the PADJILA algorithm). As 
aforementioned, if the accumulated length of sink si, |etotal(si)|, is longer than Lmax, si is antenna-critical and should be 
fixed by jumper insertion. For a pair of sinks si and its brother B(si), viaoriginal includes the sum of node vias of si and 
B(si), total edge vias which are inserted on the wires connecting si and B(si), and the extra vias required by inserted 
jumpers. In other word, viaoriginal is the total vias of si and B(si) before applying layer assignment method. Then, the 
LayerAssignment procedure obtains the acceptable layer candidates of e(si) and gives them to Layercandidates(si). Next, 
viamodified acts as viaoriginal to count and then store the total vias required by si and B(si), where e(si).layer applies 
Layercandidates(si) and the jumper inserted on e(si) is assumed to be removed . If viaoriginal is more than viamodified, or, the 
active layers are flexible enough to be assigned, the inserted jumper will be removed and e(si).layer can apply one of 
Layercandidates(si) to decrease the required vias. The active layers are defined as the layers from the current routing layer, 
e(si).layer, up to the Ltop of layer configuration. After introducing the overview of PADJILA, the proposed layer 
assignment procedure is presented in Fig. 13 in detail. 
Procedure: LayerAssignment(si)
Input: A sink si
Output: A set of layer candidates of si
1   if( e(B(si)).layer = Ltop of layer configuration )
2   {  return e(B(si)).layer;  }
3   else
4   {  if( e(B(si)).layer > e(F(si)).layer )
5       {  return e(B(si)).layer to Ltop of layer configuration;  }
6       else if( e(B(si)).layer = e(F(si)).layer )
7       {  return e(B(si)).layer+1 to Ltop of layer configuration;  }
8       else
9       {  if( F(si) locates on e(si) )
10         {  return e(F(si)).layer to Ltop of layer configuration;  }
11         else
12         {  return e(B(si)).layer+1 to Ltop of layer configuration;  }
13     }
14 }
 
Fig. 13. The proposed LayerAssignment procedure. 
For a sink si given to the proposed LayerAssignment procedure, the acceptable layer candidates of e(si) can be 
obtained immediately. When e(B(si)).layer equals the Ltop of layer configuration, the procedure will return e(B(si)).layer. 
Otherwise, the procedure will compare the layers of e(B(si)) and e(F(si)) (lines 3-14 in LayerAssignment). 
When e(B(si)).layer is higher than e(F(si)).layer, the procedure will return e(B(si)).layer up to the Ltop of layer 
configuration. If e(B(si)).layer is equal to e(F(si)).layer, the layer candidates of e(si) will be e(B(si)).layer+1 up to the 
Ltop of layer configuration. For the exceptional cases, the procedure will check F(si) does locate on e(si) or not. If it does, 
the procedure will return e(F(si)).layer up to the Ltop of layer configuration. Otherwise, the layer candidates of e(si) will 
be e(B(si)).layer+1 up to the Ltop of layer configuration. 
In order to verify the proposed PADJILA algorithm and to compare with other works, Fig. 14(a) shows an initial 
16-sink X-clock tree which is as identical as the other one shown in Fig. 10(a). PADJI can insert jumpers to fix antenna 
violations in the initial X-clock tree, as shown in Fig. 10(b). Moreover, PADJILA integrates layer assignment method 
and PADJI to decrease the number of inserted jumpers and total required vias, as shown in Fig. 14(c). Comparing with 
the result as shown in Fig. 14(b) using JILA [20] algorithm, PADJILA gets improvements in terms of delay, power, and 
total vias.

Fig. 14. (a) The initial 16-sink X-clock tree constructed by PMXF. In order to reduce the number of inserted jumpers for fixing antenna violations, the 
X-clock trees were fixed by (b) JILA [20] and (c) PADJILA algorithms, respectively. 
Table III lists the experimental results of PMXF, JILA, and PADJILA algorithms, respectively. Comparing the 
results of JI and JILA those are respectively shown in Fig. 10(b) and Fig. 14(b), the later algorithm assigned all the 13 
wires those were inserted jumpers by the former one with the Ltop of layer configuration (M4) to decrease the number of 
inserted jumpers and total vias. From the table, JILA can complete an antenna violation free X-clock tree without 
jumper insertion. It is not surprising that JILA improved the required total vias, delay, and power consumption 
compared with JI. However, assigning antenna-critical wires to the Ltop of layer configuration may result layer

After discussing the proposed PADJILA algorithm in detail, the analysis of time complexity is given as follows. As 
aforementioned, every sink in the given X-clock tree will be examined to determine whether it has antenna violation or 
not. Hence, the for loop runs in O(n). In the for loop, the DischargePath procedure obtains a set of discharge paths of 
each sink and the worst case is that each sink contains k paths. Therefore, the procedure runs in O(k). The proposed 
LayerAssignment procedure can obtain the acceptable layer candidates of the edge connecting antenna-critical sink in 
constant time. Finally, the time complexity of the proposed PADJILA algorithm is O(n2). 
VI. Experimental Results 
The proposed PADJI and PADJILA algorithms were implemented with C++ on a Windows machine with 1.7GHz 
Pentium-4 processor and 512MB memory. The fabrication parameters of ED and FED delay models for 70nm and 
130nm process are respectively listed in Table IV. Three sets of benchmarks for evaluating the proposed algorithms 
and comparing with other works were downloaded from the GSRC bookshelf [28]: (i) Primary1 and Primary2 (MCNC 
benchmarks [29]), (ii) r1-r5 (IBM benchmarks [30]), and (iii) s1423, s5378, and s15850 (ISCAS89 benchmarks [31]).

For comparative study, this work first applies PMXF [21] algorithm to construct the initial X-clock trees of all the 
benchmarks without antenna effect consideration. Next, JI [20] and PADJI algorithms respectively loaded these 
X-clock trees to detect antenna effects and then inserted jumpers to fix antenna violations. Table VI lists the 
experimental results of all the benchmarks in the number of inserted jumper, delay, skew, power, and total vias. FED 
model with 130nm fabrication parameters is used to calculate delay and the upper bound of antenna effect Lmax is given 
as 200µm. The ratio is defined as JI/PMXF or PADJI/PMXF. From the table, PADJI inserted 46.12% less jumpers than 
JI on average. Hence, PADJI had better performance of 0.0932%, 0.0913%, and 46.18% on average in terms of delay, 
power, and total vias, respectively, compared with JI. Moreover, the proposed wire sizing technique can maintain the 
zero skew property of given X-clock trees. Comparing with PMXF, PADJI slightly increased 0.0672% in delay, 
0.0749% in power, and 17.21% in total vias due to fixing antenna violations with jumper insertion.

VII. Conclusion 
Antenna effect is one of the DFM (design for manufacturing) problems in nanometer process. This work proposed a 
discharge-path-based antenna detection algorithm and achieved antenna violations free X-clock routings with jumper 
insertion algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm integrated layer assignment method to reduce the number of 
inserted jumpers for clock delay and power consumption improvements. For via timing impact consideration, 
experimental results revealed that the influences on delay and power consumption are very slight. However, modern 
complex multi-level VLSI designs wherein the number of vias is on the order of 50 million and even higher. Hence, not 
only clock tree construction but also jumper insertion and layer assignment for eliminating antenna effect should 
consider via timing impact seriously. For other DFM issues, the work can be extended to combine with optical 
proximity correction (OPC) and double via insertion into X-clock routing. For the clock tree optimization, buffers are 
inserted on the interconnections to improve clock delay. However, the metal wires connecting the input ports of buffers 
may accumulate sufficient charges to damage the gates of buffers. Therefore, the buffered clock trees should require 
more jumpers to fix antenna violations compared with bufferless clock trees.
