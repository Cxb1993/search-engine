中文摘要 
在原物料短缺，各項成本齊揚的生產環境中，供應商經常會對零售商預告其產品的供應價格將在
未來的某一時點調漲。於價格調漲前，供應商允許零售商有一次大量特別訂購的機會，但為避免零售
商訂購過多的數量而影響其利潤的賺得，故對零售商的訂購有數量上的限制。另一方面，此時零售商
會將未來進貨價格的調漲反映在零售價格上，而零售價格的變動又將影響市場對該物品的需求。本研
究擬考慮退化性物品，探討零售商在上述情況下，應如何決定其最適的訂購量及零售價格的調漲率以
使得總利潤增加量為最大。換言之，本研究將建立退化性物品的存貨模型，其中假設物品的單位進貨
價格將調漲，調漲前的訂購量有上線，並且零售商將價格反映在零售價格上，而市場需求率又與零售
價格有關。接著，對所建立的模型，擬透過數學分析方法找出最適解存在的充分且必要條件。進一步，
擬利用幾個數值範例來說明求解過程並對主要的參數進行敏感性分析。最後，將根據求解程序和理論
結果發展出一個決策支援系統，以提供管理者一個有用的決策參考工具。

1. Introduction 
Recently, due to rapid economic development in emerging nations, the world's raw material prices have 
been rising, and the cost of many goods have been facing upwards pressure; a serious issue for enterprises. 
Moreover, in today’s environment of unrestricted information, retailers can easily obtain supply price 
information through various methods. If a supplier attempts to hide information surrounding an impending 
supply price increase, he/she may lose customers in the long term. Hence, suppliers typically actively 
announce impending price increases to retailers. As retailers need to make inventory policy decisions, it is 
essential for them to consider price increases. In past studies, many authors have considered the issue of 
announcing price increases, and have proposed various analytical models to gain more insight into the 
inferences that can be made on inventory policy. Naddor (1966), one of the first researchers in this area, 
proposed an infinite horizon EOQ model which can be applied when suppliers announce a price increase. Lev 
and Soyster (1979) developed a finite horizon inventory model and determined optimal ordering policies 
based on knowledge of an ensuing price increase. Goyal (1979) analyzed Lev and Soyster’s (1979) model and 
proposed an alternative method for determining the optimal policy. Taylor and Bradley (1985) extended 
Naddor’s (1966) model, by developing optimal ordering strategies for situations where the time of the price 
increase does not coincide with the end of an EOQ cycle. Lev and Weiss (1990) presented a structure of 
optimal policies and procedures for computing the optimal policy. Ghosh (2003) presented an infinite–horizon 
deterministic inventory model that can account for inventory shortages under an announced price increase. 
Additionally, there have been several other interesting and relevant papers, such as Shah (1977), Tersine and 
Grasso (1978), Markowski (1990), Jordan (1987), Goyal and Bhatt (1988), Yanasse (1990) and Huang and 
Kulkarni (2003).  
Most of the above discussed research revealed that retailers will adopt a special order policy where order 
quantity is unlimited, when faced with an announced price increase. In practice, to avoid retailers ordering 
large quantities, suppliers can offer limited quantities prior to the price increase. Moreover, the above 
discussed literature does not account for price increases being passed on to consumers. Some retailers will 
pass on the cost of price increases to their customers, therefore it is reasonable that retailers will take limited 
order quantities and price responses into account when adopting a special order policy. 
The inventory models discussed above account for the impact of price changes, and focuses on 
determining the optimal special order quantity for the retailer. A weakness in most inventory models is that 
they neglect the deterioration of goods, a common phenomenon. It is well known that certain products, such 
as medicine, volatile liquids, fruits, and vegetables, will vaporize, spoil, or damage over time. For such 
products, losses due to deterioration cannot be ignored when determining the optimal ordering policy. 
Inventory problems relating to deteriorating items have been studied widely, for example Ghare and Schrader 
(1963) were the first to establish an EOQ model for an exponentially-decaying item, for which there is 
constant demand. Later, Covert and Philip (1973) extended this model and obtained an EOQ model for a 
variable deterioration rate, by assuming a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Philip (1974) then developed 
an inventory model with a three-parameter Weibull distribution deterioration rate. Shah (1998) extended 
Philip’s model and considered the circumstances in which a shortage is allowed. Goyal and Giri (2001) 
provided a detailed review of the deteriorating inventory literature since the early 1990s. There is a vast 
amount of literature on deteriorating items, an outline of which can be found by reviewing Moon et al. (2005),

1. The demand rate )( pD  is a non-negative continuous function of the retail price p , and satisfies 
0)(' pD  and 0)('' epD . 
2. The supplier announces that the unit price of an item will increased by a given amount, k , on a 
certain future date. 
3. The retailer has only one opportunity to replenish with the present price before the purchasing price 
increases, and the special order quantity that the retailer can order at the present price is limited to W , 
i.e., WQs e . 
4. In general, the special order quantity at the present price, sQ , is always greater than or equal to the 
optimal economic order quantity before the purchasing price increase, Q*, i.e., QsuQ*. 
5. There is no replacement or repair of deteriorated units during the period of the consideration. 
6. The replenishment is instantaneous and the lead time is zero. 
7. Shortages are not allowed. 
3. Model formulation 
In the beginning, we explain the inventory level on hand change in inventory system: the depletion of the 
inventory occurs due to the combined effects of demand and physical deterioration. Hence, the change in 
inventory level before the purchasing price increase can be illustrated by the following differential equation: 
)()()( pDtI

Given the boundary condition 0)(  TI , the solution of (1) can be represented by  
> @1)()( )(  tTepDtI TT , Tt ee0 .                                            (2)

the demand will be. Alternatively, the retailer may ignore this notice and adopt a regular order policy. 
Anticipating the high likelihood of suppliers and retailers hoarding goods for later sale at a higher retail price, 
suppliers are only willing to offer limited quantities, W , prior to the price increase.  
Our purpose is to determine the optimal special order quantity and the retail price by maximizing the 
total profit increase between special and regular orders during the depletion time of the special order quantity. 
As stated earlier, two specific situations are discussed in this study. Next, we will formulate the corresponding 
total relevant inventory cost saving function for these two cases. 
Case 1: The special order date coincides with the retailer’s replenishment date 
 In this case, if the retailer decides to adopt a special order policy and orders Qs units, then the inventory 
level at time t will be  
TT /]1)[()( )(  tTss sepDtI ,  sTt ee0 .                                           (9) 
The special order quantity with the original unit purchasing price, v , is  
TT /)1)(()0(   sTsss epDIQ .                                                 (10) 
From Assumptions 3 and 4, the special order quantity Qs is less than or equal to the limits quantity W  and is 
always larger than or equal to the optimal regular order quantity Q* (i.e., Q*e WQs e ). Hence, from (6) and 
(10), we have

The total profit of the special order during the time interval ],0[ sT  (denoted by ),(1 ss TpTPS ) is equal to 
total revenue minus the total relevant cost which consists of the ordering cost, purchasing cost and holding 
cost, and can be expressed by

If the retailer adopts its regular order policy, then the total cost of a regular order during the time interval 
[0, Ts] will be divided into two periods. In the first period, the retailer orders Q* units at the unit purchasing 
price v and retail price p. The corresponding total profit is similar to (4), and is represented by

As to the rest period, the retailer follows regular EOQ policy with the unit purchasing price kv   and retail 
price rp . Thus, the total profit during the rest period is

Consequently, the total profit of a regular order during the time interval [0, Ts] (denoted by ),(1 ss TpTPN ) is

 On the other hand, if the retailer ignores notification of the price increase and follows its regular order 
policy, the total profit during the time interval [0, Tq] will also be divided into two periods. In the first period, 
the retailer only has the profit during the depletion time of remnant q and we use the average cost analysis 
approach. It gives as follows  
  ⎭⎬⎫⎩⎨⎧ ⎥⎦⎤⎢⎣⎡  ATevhTvppDTt Tq 1)()()( *2**** * TTT T . 
Next, the retailer follows the regular order policy with the unit purchase cost kv   and retail price pr during 
the rest period. To obtain the total profit in this period, we also use the average analysis approach, which is 
given by 
  ⎭⎬⎫⎩⎨⎧ ⎥⎦⎤⎢⎣⎡  ATekvhTkvppDT tT rTrrrr qq r 1))(()()( *2**** * TTT T

As a result, if the retailer ignores the notification and follows its regular order policy during the time interval 
[0, Tq], the total profit (denoted by ),(2 ss TpTPN ) is represented by:

Therefore, the total profit increase when the special order date occurs during the retailer’s sales period (i.e., 
Case 2) can be formulated as follows: 
         ),(),(),( 222 ssssss TpTPNTpTPSTpg  .                                  (25) 
4. Conclusions and future research 
In this paper, we investigated the possible effects of a supply price increase on the retail price and 
ordering policies of retailers under the conditions of a limited special order quantity and retail price-dependent 
demand. This has not been previously studied in the relevant literature. The purpose of this study is to 
determine the retailer’s optimal order policies and retail prices in response to a price increase, through the 
maximization of the total profit increase between special and regular orders, during the depletion time of the 
special order quantity. An algorithm is established to obtain the optimal solution. Several numerical examples 
are given to illustrate the theories in practical use, and a sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution is also 
conducted by examining the main parameters. 
The proposed model can be extended in several ways. For example, it is usually observed in the
