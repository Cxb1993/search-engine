1I. Introduction
Multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technologies have drawn significant research interests
recently due to the enormous demand for high data rate communications. With the deployment
of multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver, the channel capacity can be significantly
increased [1]. In order to achieve higher data rates over the MIMO channels, spatial multiplexing
combined with some low-complexity MIMO detectors such as zero-forcing (ZF), minimum-
mean-square error (MMSE), and successive interference cancellation (SIC) detectors including
the V-BLAST [2] have been proposed. However, these low-complexity detectors suffer from
considerable performance degradation and do not achieve the full receive diversity of the MIMO
fading channels [3]. The optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, on the other hand, achieves
full receive diversity and minimizes the symbol error rate. Nonetheless, the decoding complexity
of the ML grows exponentially with the number of antennas as well as the constellation size
and therefore is seldom used in practice.
Recently, lattice-reduction (LR) has been introduced as a promising technique for improving
the performance of the suboptimal low-complexity MIMO detectors [4]–[9]. Through lattice
reduction, the original MIMO channel is transformed into an equivalent one with better condition.
The symbols are subsequently detected in the transformed domain using standard low-complexity
detectors and then transformed back to the original domain. Since the detection is performed
in a better-conditioned domain, the effect of noise amplification can be considerably mitigated,
resulting in the improved performance.
In order to perform lattice reduction, the channel state information (CSI) has to be estimated
via pilot symbols during the training phase at the receiver and hence can never be perfect. In this
paper, we show that the performance degradation of LRAD due to imperfect CSI can be mitigated
by taking the second-order statistics of the channel estimation error into account. To the best
of the author’s knowledge, there has been no previously published work studying the improved
LR-aided detector under imperfect CSI. In addition, we also show that the prior information of
the imperfect CSI can be easily taken into account by the standard lattice reduction procedure
with almost no additional hardware complexity.
Notations: Throughout this paper, matrices and vectors are set in boldface, with uppercase
letters for matrices and lower case letters for vectors. The superscripts T and H denote the
3Similar to (2) where the primal lattice H is reduced, one can instead reduce the dual lattice
H#, given by
H# = BU−1, (3)
where H# = H†H = H(HHH)−1. With (3), the noiseless received signal vector Hx is now
represented in the new basis Hx = (HU−H)z, where z = UHx.
The idea of the LR-aided detectors is to first detect z in the lattice-reduced constellation
and then transform the result zˆ back to the original constellation via xˆ = Tzˆ or xˆ = U−H zˆ.
Since the new lattice basis is designed to be near orthogonal, near-ML performance can be
obtained even by using low-complexity detectors such as ZF, MMSE, and SIC [8, 11]. A few
effective lattice reduction algorithms such as the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lova´sz (LLL) algorithm [12]
have been proposed for LRADs. When combined with LLL, (3) is often referred as the type-I
LLL reduction or dual-LLL (DLLL) reduction, while (2) is referred as the type-II or primal-
LLL reduction [8]. The Seysen’s lattice reduction [13] which can be viewed as a suboptimal
combined strategy which (locally) minimizes both the primal and dual lattices simultaneously,
has also been studied recently [9].
III. Improved LR-aided MIMO detection under imperfect CSI
(ICSI-LRAD)
In a real communication environment, the channel state information can only be obtained through
estimation and therefore is never perfect. The assumption of perfect CSI in the conventional
LRADs may be overly idealistic to some extent. In this section, we present a new class of lattice
reduction aided detectors (ICSI-LRADs) which consistently outperform the conventional LRADs
in the presence of imperfect CSI.
A standard technique for the receiver to acquire the CSI is to transmit pilot symbols along
with the data. Let Xp denote the Nt × NP transmitted pilot matrix with average pilot symbol
energy
Ep =
1
NtNP
‖Xp‖2F =
1
NtNP
tr{XpXHp }.
5expression of H and y, it follows that the output of the MMSE filter x′ can then be expressed
as
x′ = Gy = H†y, (9)
where H† = (HHH)−1HH denotes the pseudo-inverse of H. With the equivalent zero-forcing
representation (9), it is clear that the performance of linear MMSE detection is determined by
the condition of H.
Based on the discussions above, we therefore propose a new class of LR-aided MIMO
detector, ICSI-LRAD. In the proposed ICSI-LRAD, the imperfect CSI is taken into account in
the LR procedure by first lattice-reduce the generalized extended channel matrix H using primal
and/or dual reduction via the Seysen’s or LLL algorithm. The symbols are then subsequently
detected in the lattice-reduced constellation using MMSE or MMSE-OSIC (MMSE-SIC with
optimal detection order) equalizations and transformed back to the original constellation. It is
worth mentioning that the proposed ICSI-LRAD can also be viewed as a generalization of the
conventional MMSE-based LRADs [11] for the case where the CSI is imperfect.
IV. Simulation Results
In the sequel, we present the simulation results of the proposed ICSI-LRADs under a variety
of simulation scenarios. Throughout the simulations, 16-QAM is used for modulation and the
energy of the pilot symbol Ep is set to be the same as that of the data symbol σ2x. The Eb/N0
is defined as the equivalent received energy per bit, Nrσ
2
x
σ2 log2M
.
Fig. 1 shows the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of a 4 × 4 MIMO system using primal
LLL reduction with Np = Nt = 4. It is clear from the figure that both the conventional and the
ICSI-LRADs can still achieve full diversity order in the presence of imperfect CSI. By taking
the statistics of the channel estimation error into account, the proposed LRADs is capable of
improving the performance of the conventional LRADs by roughly 0.27 dB in both LLL-MMSE
and LLL-MMSE-OSIC under the simulated scenario.
Fig. 2 shows the BER of the proposed ICSA-LRADs under different Np. The dotted line in
the figure shows the BER performance under perfect channel estimation (Np/Nt = ∞). It is
clear that the accuracy of the channel estimation has a huge influence on the performance. In the

V. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce a new family of LR-aided MIMO detectors (ICSI-LRAD) which are
capable of exploiting the prior knowledge of the second order statistics of the channel estimation
error. We show that such prior information can be easily taken into account by the standard lattice
reduction procedure with almost no additional hardware complexity.The methodology developed
in this paper is applicable to all sorts of MMSE-based LRADs and the resulting ICSI-LRADs
consistently outperform their conventional counterparts as verified through a variety of simulation
scenarios.

1A New Lattice Reduction Algorithm for
LR-aided MIMO Linear Detection
I. Introduction
The enormous demand for high data rate wireless telecommunication services has generated
significant research interests in the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technologies. By
deploying multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver in a rich scattering environment,
it has been shown that considerable capacity enhancement can be obtained [1]. Higher data rates
can therefore be achieved economically by employing spatial-multiplexing, together with low-
complexity MIMO detectors, such as zero-forcing (ZF), minimum-mean-square error (MMSE),
and ordered successive interference cancellation (OSIC) detectors [2]. However, all these low-
complexity detectors suffer from serious performance degradation from the optimal ML detector
and do not achieve the full receive diversity of the MIMO fading channels.
Recently, lattice-reduction (LR) has been introduced as a promising technique, which can
improve the performance of many suboptimal MIMO detectors [3]–[8]. For LR-aided MIMO
detection, the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lova´sz (LLL) algorithm [9] and the Seysen’s algorithm (SA) [10]
have been considered almost exclusively to date. As the error rate of a system varies significantly
with the type of detectors in use, the LLL and SA, which are designed to generate bases with
relatively short basis vectors regardless of the receiver’s structure, may not provide the best
performance.
In this paper, we have proposed a new LR algorithm for LR-aided MIMO linear detection (LD).
The proposed algorithm consists of a standard reduction algorithm, such as LLL or SA, followed
by a newly proposed C(p,k) reduction algorithm. The LLL or SA serves as an initialization stage,
while the C(p,k) reduction algorithm is designed to improve the minimum Euclidean distance from
the received signal vector to the decision boundary of an LR-aided linear detector. By taking the
decision region into account, we showed that substantial performance improvement in the error
rate, when compared with the conventional LR-aided linear detection, can be obtained with only
moderate increase in the complexity.
3L (B), if and only if T is unimodular [12]. With the new lattice basis B˜ = [b˜1, · · · , b˜M ],
the noiseless received signal vector Bc is also represented as B˜z, where c = [c1, . . . , cM ]T and
z = T−1c.
The idea of LR-aided MIMO detection is to first detect the coordinate vector z in the new
basis B˜ and then transform the result zˆ back to the original basis B via cˆ = Tzˆ. With the help
of many existing LR algorithms, the new basis B˜ can be designed to be near-orthogonal, which
significantly improves the reliability of many low-complexity suboptimal detectors [3, 4, 13].
Two popular LR algorithms in the communications literature are the LLL [9] and the SA [10].
The LLL algorithm features polynomial time complexity and guarantees to find the shortest basis
vector up to an exponential factor by using an upper bound on the orthogonality defect, defined
by
δ(B˜) =
∏M
m=1 ‖b˜m‖2
det
(
B˜T B˜
) , (6)
while the SA simultaneously reduces the primal basis B˜ and its dual
B˜# = [b˜#1 , . . . , b˜
#
M ] = B˜
(
B˜T B˜
)−1
(7)
by minimizing the Seysen’s measure
S(B˜) =
M∑
m=1
‖b˜m‖2‖b˜#m‖2 (8)
iteratively until a local minimum is found. Note that both the orthogonality measure and the
Seysen’s measure attain their minimum when the reduced basis B˜ is orthogonal. For M ≤ 31,
it has been observed that the SA is capable of finding bases with shorter basis vectors, when
compared with the LLL [8, 10].
C. Performance of LR-aided linear detection
The performance of LR-aided MIMO detection based on LLL and SA has been studied and
compared recently [8, 14]. It has been shown that with the assistance of LR, full receive diversity
of the MIMO fading channels can be achieved with low-complexity suboptimal detectors. For
the case of linear detection, SA has been shown to consistently outperform the LLL algorithm in
the sense of generating more orthogonal bases, thus providing lower error rate [8, 14]. In [15],
5Consider the following sequence {GLD} defined by
{GLD} =
{
‖h˜1 sin θ1‖, . . . , ‖h˜M sin θM‖
}
(15)
and let r be an extended real number. Then the generalized mean [17] of {GLD} of order r is
defined as
µ
(r)
M ({GLD}) =
(∑M
m=1 ‖h˜m sin θm‖r
M
)1/r
, (16)
which includes the minimum, harmonic mean, geometric mean, arithmetic mean, and the maxi-
mum as special cases corresponding to r = −∞, r = −1, r = 0, r = 1, and r = ∞, respectively.
It follows that dLDmin can be expressed as
dLDmin =

(
min

‖h˜m‖ sin θm
)
=
1
2

Inequalities that hold for the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means can also be considered
as special cases of the following inequality [17]:
µ
(s)
M ({GLD}) ≤ µ(t)M ({GLD}), for −∞ ≤ s < t ≤ +∞, (18)
and the equality holds if and only if ‖h˜1 sin θ1‖ = . . . = ‖h˜M sin θM‖, or one of the ‖h˜m sin θm‖’s
is zero with s ≤ 0.
From the generalized-mean inequality (18) and the expression in (17), we come up with the
idea of approximating dLDmin by 12µ

H˜

j, h˜j+1, . . . , h˜M ], (26)
h˜
′
j = λi,jh˜i + h˜j, (27)
where i, j ∈ {1, . . . ,M}, i 6= j. It follows that the dual basis of H˜′ can be expressed as
H˜

i = h˜
#

The algorithm then seeks for an integer number λˆi,j , such that the decrement ∆(λi,j) = C(p,k)(H˜
′
)−
C(p,k)(H˜) is minimized (most negative), i.e.
λˆi,j = argmin
λi,j
∆(λi,j). (32)
Using (25)-(31) and the definition of C(p,k)(H˜) (23), the calculation of ∆(λi,j) can then be
simplified as
∆(λi,j) = ‖h˜i‖k‖h˜
#
i − λi,jh˜
#
j ‖p+k + ‖λi,jh˜i + h˜j‖k‖h˜

j ‖p+k
− ‖h˜i‖k‖h˜
#
i ‖p+k − ‖h˜j‖k‖h˜
#
j ‖p+k. (33)
If we only consider positive integers p and k, then ∆(λi,j) corresponds to a polynomial function
of λi,j with degree p + k. For the Seysen’s case (p = 0, k = 2), ∆(λi,j) is simply a parabolic
function, and hence, the best update value λˆi,j can be easily obtained as [10]

special case, where p = 2 and k = 0, ∆(λi,j) is also a parabolic function, and hence, we can

From (21), it can be noted that the bound becomes looser as k increases, and hence, the value
for k should not be too large. Furthermore, the value of p should be sufficiently large, because

M ({GLD}) is a better approximation of dLDmin for larger p. This observation is verified from
the numerical simulations shown in Fig. 1, where the average dLDmin’s of the proposed LR-aided
zero-forcing detectors, averaged over 105 channel realizations are plotted with different (p, k)
combinations. It can be observed that dLDmin tends to decrease as k increases, and tends to increase
as p increases.

The choice of the parameters (p, k) is also subjected to implementation considerations. First,
when implemented in a practical system, the value for p cannot be too large, because larger p
requires larger dynamic range. Second, even numbers for p and k are more preferred because
the computationally intensive square root operations can be avoided. In addition to these design
considerations, one particular choice (p, k) = (2, 0) has the unique complexity advantage,

results have also verified the observations in [20] that the LR-schemes provide more significant
gain for higher order modulations, because the performance loss due to boundary effect in the
quantization is negligible in large constellation cases.
To study the performance and complexity tradeoff, we compared the time complexity of the
LLL-C(2,0) and SA-C(2,0) with that of the conventional LLL and SA (Fig. 4), demonstrating
the empirical CDFs of the total number of iterations. The computational complexity was also
compared (Fig. 5), showing the empirical CDFs of the total number of floating point operations
(flops). The simulation results showed that the SA has the lowest time complexity, followed by
the SA-C(2,0), LLL, and LLL-C(2,0), whereas the LLL has the lowest computational complexity,
followed by the LLL-C(2,0), SA, and SA-C(2,0).

denoted by ‖ · ‖ and IN denotes the N ×N identity matrix.
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Consider a MIMO communications system transmitting
R bits per channel use over a rich scattering environment
with Nt transmit and Nr receive antennas. For each symbol
period, the data stream (R bits) is first de-multiplexed into
L substreams (L ≤ Nt), and each substream (R/L bits)
is mapped independently to a symbol in the same M -ary
constellation set QM , M = R/L, resulting in the L × 1
transmitted symbol vector xL = [x1, x2, . . . , xL]T ∈ QLM .
A spatial mapper is then used to map xL to L of the available
antennas for transmission. Let S be an ordered subset of L
selected antenna indices, and H ∈ CNr×Nt be the channel
matrix between the available transmit and receive antennas,
then the transmitted vector xL essentially communicates over
an equivalent channel HS ∈ CNr×L. It follows that the Nr×1
received vector y can now be represented as
y = HSxL +w, (1)
where w ∈ CNr denotes the noise vector, modelled as a
zero-mean circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian vector with
covariance σ2INr . It will be assumed that the transmitter
has no knowledge of the channel state information H and
hence the transmitted power is equally distributed over all the
selected antennas. For convenience, we normalize the transmit-
ted power to unity, which gives E{xLxHL } = (1/L) IL. We
also assume perfect channel estimation at the receiver and the
existence of a low-rate error-free feedback channel between
the receiver and the transmitter.
In the framework of multi-mode antenna selection, we con-
sider a set of operating modes m ∈ {1, . . . , M}. Each mode
m is associated with a unique value Lm ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Nt}
and an optimal subset Sm, representing the number of selected
antennas and the set of selected antenna indices, respectively.
By adapting the operating mode and selected antenna subset
(m,Sm) according to the instant channel state information,
additional array gain is exploited. In the following sections,
we investigate the optimal multi-mode antenna selection in
conjunction with V-BLAST systems using OSIC detection.
III. MSE-BASED MULTI-MODE ANTENNA SELECTION
CRITERIA FOR V-BLAST
Consider a multi-mode antenna selection V-BLAST system
operating at the mth mode, then the nearest neighbour union
bound (NNUB) on the vector symbol error rate (probability
that at least one substream symbol is in error) is given by
VSER ≤ Lm ·K(m,R) ·Q
(√
SNRmin(Sm)
d2min(m,R)
2
)
,
(2)
where K(m,R) is the average number of nearest neigh-
bours of the constellation QM , SNRmin(Sm) is the min-
imum post-processing SNR among all the decoded sub-
streams, and dmin(m,R) is the minimum Euclidean distance
between any two symbols in QM , given by dmin(m,R) =(
6
2R/Lm−1
)(
1
Lm
)
. Despite a multi-mode antenna selection
criterion can be obtained by minimizing the NNUB of all
modes, the requirement of numerical computations of the Q-
functions often makes it impractical in most realistic systems.
Instead, a very good approximation to that is by maximizing
the argument within the Q-function of the upper bound (2).
Using the relation between SNRmin and the maximum mean-
square error MSEmax,
SNRmin(Sm) =
1
MSEmax(Sm)
− γ, (3)
with γ = 0 for ZF V-BLAST and γ = 1 for MMSE V-BLAST,
we obtain the following criterion
(mˆ, Sˆmˆ) = argmax
m
max
Sm
J(m,Sm), (4)
where
J(m,Sm) =
(
1
MSEmax(Sm)
− γ
)
d2min(m,R), (5)
and
MSEmax(Sm) = arg max
`=1,...,Lm
MSE`(Sm). (6)
MSE`(Sm) denotes the mean-square error at the `th detection
stage of a V-BLAST receiver with respect to the optimal
detection order {p`}Lm`=1 [11]. In V-BLAST systems, the
MSE`(Sm)’s are given by
MSE`(Sm) = σ
2
[
H¯HSm,`H¯Sm,` + αmI
]−1
, (7)
where H¯Sm,` is obtained by removing the p1, p2, . . . , p`−1th
columns of HSm , and αm = Lmσ2γ. The optimal solution
to (4) can only be obtained by exhaustively searching all
combinations among all the modes. For each combination in
each mode, it can be shown that the computational complexity
is of the order O(NrL2m) [13]. It follows that the overall
complexity of multi-mode antenna selection with exhaustive
search is of the order O
(∑M
m=1 C
Nt
Lm
NrL
2
m
)
, which is com-
putationally prohibitive. In the following, we propose a new
MAS algorithm which is capable of achieving the error rate
performance comparable to the optimal exhaustive search with
significantly lower computational complexity.
IV. PROPOSED MULTI-MODE ANTENNA SELECTION
ALGORITHM
Let there be M modes in the considered system with
mode indices 1, 2, · · · , M , which are labelled such that
L1 < L2 < . . . < LM . The proposed multi-mode antenna
selection system initiates with an empty set S , and sequentially
adds a transmit antenna with index ωt ∈ Sc into S until LM
antenna indices are obtained. As the number of antennas in S
increases from 1 to LM , the subset S is recorded as Sm if the
number of antennas in S equals Lm. Finally, the mode and
antenna subset that maximize
(
1
MSEmax(Sm)
− γ
)
d2min(m,R)
will be selected. A computationally efficient implementation
of the proposed algorithm is described as follows.
from E(n) and F(n) using the proposed recursion. Summing
up the complexity required in computing the MSE(n+1)` ’s [13],
the numbers of multiplications and additions at the (n+ 1)th
step can then be shown to be Nr(n+1)+ 23n
3+3n2+ 103 n+1
and Nr(n+1)+ 12n
3+ 32n
2− 12n, respectively. Hence, the total
number of multiplications and additions in the proposed multi-
mode antenna selection algorithm can be computed as (Nr +
1) +
∑LM−1
n=1 (Nt − n)
[
Nr(n+ 1) +
2
3n
3 + 3n2 + 103 n+ 1
]
and 1 +
∑LM−1
n=1 (Nt − n)
[
Nr(n+ 1) +
1
2n
3 + 32n
2 − 12n
]
,
respectively.
To quantify the complexity advantages of the proposed
algorithm, the number of required floating-point operations
(flops) are plotted in Fig. 1 with respect to Nt’s. The proposed
algorithm is compared with the optimal MAS using criterion in
(4) using exhaustive search, eigenmode-based MAS proposed
in [7], and TAS algorithms using min-max MSE criterion
with exhaustive search. From Fig. 1, it is observed that the

optimal MAS requires much higher computational complexity
compared to the other MAS algorithms. The eigenmode MAS
has less computational complexity than the proposed one for
small Nt, but has higher complexity for Nt ≥ 11. Compared to
the optimal TAS, the proposed MAS has also less complexity
than the TAS with L = 2 and L = 4, respectively.
VI. SIMULATION
In this section, we present the simulation results of the
proposed MAS algorithm. Throughout the simulations, the
channel is assumed to be quasi-static Rayleigh faded with
realizations i.i.d. from frame to frame, with each frame spans
10 symbol durations. Each simulation point is obtained by av-
eraging over a frame of 107 channel realizations. We consider
a multimode antenna selection MIMO system using MMSE
V-BLAST detection with Nt = 8 and Nr = 4. The number
of bits per channel use is fixed to R = 8 and three different
modes with L1 = 1, L2 = 2, and L3 = 4 are considered in the
simulation. The vector symbol error rate (VSER) of a number
of algorithms are plotted in Fig. 2.

within 0.2dB to the optimal MAS with roughly 6% of the
overall computational complexity. Compared to the eigen-
based MAS, our proposed algorithm provides roughly 1 dB
VSER improvement, at the expense of only roughly twice
of the computational complexity. The nice performance of
the proposed algorithm can be better understood from Fig.
3, where the relative frequency of occurrence of different
modes are plotted. It is observed from the figure that the
proposed algorithm has a mode distribution very close to
the optimal MAS, while the eigenmode-based MAS tends
to select a different mode. This is because the eigenmode-
based selection utilizes an upperbound to decorrelate the joint
optimization of (m,Sm) and does not consider the structure
of V-BLAST. Fig. 3 also shows that for the optimal MAS,
L3 = 4 has the highest frequency of occurrence, whereas
L1 = 1 has almost zero frequency of occurrence and hence can
be neglected in practice. This behaviour can also be observed
in Fig. 2, where the optimal TAS using L = 4 performs very
close to the optimal MAS, whereas the optimal TAS using
L = 1 has the worst VSER performance. In comparison to the
TAS schemes, our proposed MAS algorithm has the VSER
performance comparable to the optimal TAS using L = 4
