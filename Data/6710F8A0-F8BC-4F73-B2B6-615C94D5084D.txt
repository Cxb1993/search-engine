 The aim of this study is to develop a novel chemical gas sensing nanocomposite materials. The traditional use of 
gas sensing polymer is to add carbon nanotube to increase the composite’s conductivity. However, we add functionalized 
carbon nanotube to fill the free volume of the sensing polymer films and enhance the gas absorption/desorption response 
time of these nanocomsites. These materials are prepared by mixing functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
(MWNTs) and Poly (n, n dimethylamino propylsilsequioxane) SXNR polymer. SXNR polymer acts as a backbone to 
give stable and homogeneous cast thin films. The MWNTs are cylindrical with a diameter in the range 40-60 nm and 
with a length of up to several micrometers. Furthermore, the using of strong oxidants, such as HNO3 and H2O2 
(v/v=3/2), is applied to oxidize CNTs to form carboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups with higher hydrophilic property to 
improve the property and characterization on the surface. Therefore, the functionalized CNTs would be more easily 
dispersed in the polymer. These new materials are coated on the Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) device and try to 
increase sensitivity toward specific classes of analysis vapors. The proposed materials show an enhanced sensitivity upon 
exposure to ethanol and dimethyl methylphosphonate (Dmmp) vapors. Additionally, the performances of our 
nanocomposite film are 10 times higher than those polymers without functionalized carbon nanotube.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)are promising nanostructure materials1 in the past decade because of their unique optic, 
electric, magnetic, and mechanical properties.2-5 Carbon nanotubes have also led to many new technical developments 
extensively reported and discussed. 
 
2. Experiments 
2.1 Growth of CNTs and their characters analysis 
In this paper, we used the thermal chemical vapor deposition to prepare CNTs with the following processes: First, 
we used the nano-intermetallic with two and three components of alloys as catalysts, such as Mg70Ni30 or Mg30Ni70Mox, 
and put these catalysts in the center of the quartz tube (diameter: 5cm; length: 90cm) with argon atmosphere and purged 
to vacuum. Then induced the hydrogen gas flow (50 cc/min) at 500  to reduce these ℃ catalysts and the CNTs were 
growth by decomposing hydrocarbon source such as CH4 and C2H2 in 100 cc/min flow rate at 650  for 30 minute℃ s. 
Finally we took out these CNTs reactants to characters analyze.  
The surface morphology of CNTs were measured by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), TEM (Transmission 
Electron Microscopy), HR-TEM (High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy),  FT/IR and Raman microscopy 
were used to identify the structure .  
2.2 Functionalization of CNTs 
The as-grown CNTs were soaked in the strong oxidants HNO3 (300 ml) and slowly added H2O2 (200ml) to oxidize 
CNTs over 3 hours. After above reaction, we centrifuged the solution at a speed of 3000 rpm to separate the solvent and 
reactants. Then took the reactants in the deionized water (1000 ml) to filtrate, and repeated this process over two times. 
The leaches were dry at 80℃ to collect hydrophilic CNTs (CNT-COOH). 
2.3 Coating of CNTs-polymer composite sensing film   
The SXNR (poly (n, n dimethylamino propylsisesquioxane)) were often used as chemical sensing polymer in the 
literatures. We dissolved 0.015g SXNR in 50 ml ethanol solvent then added in 0.015g functionalize CNT-COOH and 
used ultrasonic over 3 hrs to assist the disperse of CNT in the solution. Before the CNTs aggregating, the air spray 
coating method 13,14was used to prepare the CNTs-polymer composite sensing film. The spray coating equipment is show 
in the fig 1; the nitrogen was carrying gas to take solution through the nebulizer to formed aerosol coating on the SAW 
device. After the solvent (ethanol) evaporated, the residual were composite sensing film. In the above coating processes 
the center frequency of SAW device was recoded by spectrum analyzer induce to calculate the thickness of film. The 
peaks including 1400、1580、1723 and 3400cm-1 of the functionalizes MWNTs. Because of the oxidation process, the 
as-grown CNTs have been functionalized with hydrophilic functional group. They were terminated with carboxylic acid 
groups (–COOH, IR frequency 1723cm–1) or hydroxyl group (-OH, IR frequency 3400cm–1). Spectra C shown the as-grown 
CNTs have no special characteristic peaks in IR spectrum.  
3.2 Evaluation of the MWNT-SXNR Nanocomposite Film 
One major problem of working with CNTs is their difficult dispersion into polymers, or at least this is what was 
thought until now. The SEM image (Fig.6) disclosed that the surface of the as-grown MWNTs mixed with SXNR 
polymer film and the functionalize-MWNTs-SXNR composite film. The polymer films were microporous and rough and 
we found the as-grown MWNTs were hard to disperse in the solvent. Figure 6a-b show the as-grown MWNTs would 
aggregate together in the polymer film even after stirred all day long. However, the functionalize CNTs would be very 
easy to disperse in the solvent and these solutions were also very easy to hybrid with polymer. Figure 6c-d show the 
uniform distribution of functionalizes CNTs in the surface of polymer composite film even after the air–spray coating 
process.  
3.3 Sensor Characteristics and Measurement Options. 
In this section, we demonstrate the efficiency of fluctuation-enhanced SAW sensing of gases. The demonstration is based 
on practical data and analytical calculations for the cases of single gas 
It has been reported that desorption of gas molecules from a sensing polymer membrane was a relatively slow process 
because of the van del weal force or strong hydrogen bond between the gas molecular and sensing polymer films like the 
sensing reaction between water molecules and Nafion [17]. In our study, we also investigated this phenomenon in our gas 
sensing results. As shown in Fig. 7, the times of gas adsorption and desorption of SXNR films were extremely slower 
than that of CNT-COOH/SXNR composite films. The process of adsorption and desorption of gas molecules on 
CNT-COOH/SXNR composite films was found to be reversible and totally rapid. It was also noted that 
CNT-COOH/SXNR composite films reached thermodynamic equilibrium faster than SXNR films. The response time 
and recovery time of the CNT-COOH/SXNR composite films were more rapidly than that of the SXNR films. In 
addition, the CNT-COOH/SXNR composite films also revealed better alcohol gas sensitivity (stable frequency shift,ġ͂
ŧ) about 8KHz and the SXNR films were only 5 KHz.
