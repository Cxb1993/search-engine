英文摘要: 
Gallium Nitride based AlGaN/GaN HEMT has drawn a lot of attention in high frequency and high power 
microwave applications.  In practical implementation scenarios, gate process technology plays a critical 
role in the determination of the high frequency performance of the device in addition to the epitaxial 
structure and the selection of channel materials together with the device structure. The main scope of 
work for this project is the development of AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN HEMT devices for Ka-band applications.  
In the formation of the T-gate structure, double-recess technology was applied to reduce the 
gate-to-channel distance for concerns about application in high frequencies. Complete characterizations 
of the device through microwave measurements were performed together with precise parameter 
extraction technique of equivalent circuits to determine the optimal layout structures of the devices. 
Through the completion of this project, we have successfully fabricated devices suitable for applications 
in RF front-ends of long range point-to-point communication systems.

12nm recess depth was etched to enhance the aspect ratio to around 5.5. Finally, gate metal was lifted off 
by dimethylacetamide(ZDMAC) to form 100-nm T-shaped recessed gate. The gate width of the devices in 
this work was 2 x 50μm. 
Results and Discussion 
DC performance of the device was measured by Agilent E52702B. As shown in Figure 2(a), the 
drain current characteristics of the device with a 100nm recessed gate appear a good pinch-off behavior 
without short channel effect, which is due to the enhanced aspect ratio by the gate recess technique. The 
off-state breakdown voltage is 90V as defined by the drain leakage current up to 1mA/mm. Figure 2(b) 
shows the gate leakage current (IG) during the device operation. It can be seen that gate leakage current is 
lower than 2μA/mm at each bias point. Such a low leakage current could be contributed to the extremely 
low recess etching rate which helps reduce the damages caused during the dry etching process. After 
recessing, more than one order reduction in the reverse leakage current was observed using Schottky 
diode (not shown here). This finding is in agreement with what reported by Y. Okamoto et. al [*]. They 
propose the reduction of leakage current after recessing is due to the suppression of the tunneling 
component of the gate leakage current by the slight removal of the surface n-type AlGaN. However, the 
mechanism is not understood clearly and need further study. 
The S parameters of the fabricated device were measured using on-wafer probing system with 
Agilent E8361A network analyzer. Standard LRRM calibration method was adopted to calibrate the 
measurement system with reference planes set at the tips of the probes.  Fig. 3 shows the frequency 
dependence of the current gain H21, the power gain MAG/MSG, and the Mason’s unilateral gain U of the 
device measured at Vds = 10 V and Vgs = −3 V. The parasitic effects (mainly capacitive) due to the 
probing pads have been carefully removed from the measured S parameters using the same method as in 
[8] and the equivalent circuit model in [9]. Since the geometry of the probing pads is comparable to the 
device itself, the S parameters of the open probing pads have been carefully characterized through 
full-wave electromagnetic simulations with measurement. The unity current gain cutoff frequency (FT) 
and the maximum frequency of oscillation (FMAX) were extrapolated as 48 GHz and 75 GHz respectively 
using a -20dB/decade regression as shown in Fig. 3. In spite of a relatively low transconductance value 
due to 7μm source/drain spacing, the device still performs a good frequency response due to the 
submicron gate length and decreased gate-source resistance through recess etching.    
High-frequency noise properties at room temperature were measured over the frequency of 18 – 40 GHz 
using Auriga noise measurement system with Agilent 8975A noise figure analyzer. Figure 4 plots the 
minimum noise figure (NFmin) and associated gain (Gass) as a function of frequency at the bias point of 
VGS = -3V and VDS = 10V, where the lowest noise figure was achieved. A minimum noise figure (NFmin) 
of 1.2dB (1.8dB) with associated gain (Gass) of around 6.5dB (5dB) at 20 GHz (30 GHz) were observed. 
Such a low noise can be contributed to the low contact resistance of 0.28Ω‧mm, and the ultimately low 
gate leakage current of 0.9μA/mm during the device operation. To the authors’ best knowledge, this 
30GHz noise performance is the best reported for GaN-based HEMTs with a recessed gate so far. The 
other important figure of merit often used to characterize the broadband low-noise amplifiers’
