21. 緒論
利用潤滑油為潤滑流體所製作的斜墊式液動軸承，使用在高轉速大
型產業機械，如渦輪發電機或壓縮機時，常較傳統的平面頸軸承，有較
優異的鋼性功能等優點，特別在超高轉速或輕負荷(如垂直軸)情況下，斜
墊式液動軸承可克服不穩定的油漩(oil whirl)現象；近年來，斜墊式液動
軸承，也應用在工具機高速主軸及計算機硬碟主軸等產業 (Xie, 2003)。
在 1997 年，多片型的斜墊式流體液動軸承首先應用在硬碟驅動裝置
上，經過多年的大量生產使用後，已經證明有相當的可靠性
(western-Digital, 2002)；由於液動軸承具有優越的低噪音與低振動的特
性，因此近年來已漸取代鋼珠軸承，Jang and Yoon (2002)針對應用在硬碟
驅動機構中的徑向與軸向結合的液動軸承(a coupled journal and thrust
hydrodynamic bearing)，以數值分析方法解析雷諾微分方程式，獲得這種
軸承內部的壓力分佈、負荷與摩擦力特性。
傾斜墊頸軸承的傾斜墊數目有3,4,5,6及12片的設計曾在文獻報告
上出現，在 1964 年，Lund 提出“Lund，s Pad Assembly Method”是第一
篇重要的論文，以分析的方法計算軸承鋼性及阻尼係數，為傾斜墊頸軸
承動態分析中最重要的一個設計參考文獻，“Lund，s Pad Assembly
Method”針對傾斜墊頸軸承其中的單一傾斜墊作性能分析，然後再把各
別傾斜墊的功能特性全數相加，用以獲得整體傾斜墊頸軸承的鋼性及阻
尼係數；Fu and Parkins (1992)及其他的研究者則提出整體分析模式
(global analysis)用以解傾斜墊的油膜壓力，這種分析方法將軸承偏心比
及各個傾斜墊的傾斜角作分析前的預估，然後以疊代過程得到穩定解。
上述兩個主要的分析方法，有 20 多年傾斜墊頸軸承設計經驗的
Nicholas(2003)，仍然推薦使用 Lund 的分析概念。

解析雷諾方程式，首先須先知道各個傾斜墊的油膜厚度，這種油膜厚度雖然
已有一些研究者提出油膜厚度的計算方程式(Allaire, 1975；Balbahadur,
4斜墊的潤滑性能，目前最典型的設計為潤滑油進口設在兩斜墊中間的一
個小孔，油出口設在兩斜墊之間邊上的兩個大孔(如圖二所示)，這種設
計使大部份通過斜墊負荷區的熱油都能排出，但仍有部份熱油流入次一
個斜墊，影響了斜墊的潤滑特性，因此 Kingsbury 公司早期設計一種
LEG(圖三 a)油路，一個進油管直通斜墊面上，這種設計保證冷油直接流
到斜墊面上，而潤滑熱油則流到斜墊之間邊上的孔洞，Kingsbury 公司後
期又設計一種 BPG(圖三 b)油路，基本構想與功能同 LEG 的設計。註：LEG
表示 Leading Edge Groove。BPG 表示 Between Pad Groove。
由於斜墊軸承潤滑過程所產生的潤滑熱油，
影響了整個傾斜墊軸承的潤滑特性，因此才有
Kingsbury 公司的油路專利設計(圖三)，但由
圖三可見這種專利設計，增加了零組件數目及
組合工作負擔，因此仍不是很理想的設計。基
於此，本文設計了一種斜墊軸承潤滑油路，如圖四所示，圖四中顯示在
進口端的斜墊表面上，銑製一個油槽，圖四箭頭指示潤滑油由斜墊側邊
油孔進油，進入油槽後，再流入斜墊面上，最後再流出兩斜墊之間邊上
的兩個大孔，本文的設計，顯然免除了零組件增加及組合工作負擔。
4. 斜墊頸軸承與試驗機構製作
由於傾斜墊頸軸承是很精密的潤滑作動元件，在設計時，要先決定軸
承的製造公差尺寸以及轉軸與承套間的間隙值(nearing clearance)，圖

試作一個頸軸承，其次選舉預負荷m 為 0.2，由公式(5)m 之定義，可計

ABSTRACT
The bearing performance of a finite length porous
journal bearing fed by externally pressurized air is
numerical analyzed. The effects of the feeding
mechanism, represented by feeding parameter Λp and 
journal rotating speed, represented by bearing number
Λ, are considered in the present study. Thenon-linear
coupled PDE governed the pressure solutions in the
regions of bearing space and porous matrix are solved
by a quasi-linear numerical scheme associated with an
under-relaxation factor. It is found that aerodynamic
lubricating effect is significant for the porous bearing
having a smal Λpnumber, and the aerostatic effect is
dominated inside the bearing space with large Λp 
number. It is also shown that the aerodynamic effect is
further promoted for the bearing operating at heavy
load, at which the minimum film thickness becomes
small. The results show that a bearing possessed with
a small Λp=0.1 will have a higher risk for the journal
touching the bearing wall than a bearing with Λp= 1. 
Therefore, as far as the loading capacity and bearing
safety are concerned,a porous journal bearing with
feeding parameter Λp designed between 0.5 and 1 is 
recommended.

INTRODUCTION
Gas-lubricated journal bearings have been widely
used in precise industry applications such as gyros,
special machine tools and supports for high-speed
rotation machines. This type of bearing meets the
requirements of clean, low viscosity, and easy-access
working fluid (mainly air). Researchers have developed
many restrictor-type air bearings for different purpose,
such as pocketed orifices, annular orifices, slot channel
and porous matrices, all of which have different
advantages over the others. When porous material
serves as a restrictor, an aerodynamic pressure field of
gas film can be established in the bearing clearance.
Due to a strong lubricating effect, externally pressurized
porous air journal bearings show higher load capacity
and stiffness than discrete hole admission bearings.
Aero-static and dynamic porous gas bearings have
been extensively used in precision manufacturing
industry. They are preferred over hole-admission
bearings due to their low viscosity and load capacity.
Porous journal bearings had been studied by
many researchers in recent years. Most of them
concerned about the bearing performances in related to
some specific topics. Based on Darcy flow model, Su
and Lie (1) investigated numerically the rotation effect
on porous air journal bearing performance. Lin and
Hwang (2), using the Brinkman model, analyzed the
hydrodynamic lubrication of a short porous oil journal
bearing. Prakash and Gururajan (3) developed different
forms of Reynolds-type equations to explore the effect
of velocity slip in an infinity long rough porous journal
bearing. Naduvinamani et al. (4,5) conducted a
theoretical study on the static and dynamic behavior of
a short porous journal bearing with special interest on
squeeze film effect and surface roughness effects.
Using an iteratively numerical scheme, Saha and
Majumdar (6) analyzed the bearing characteristics of a
two-layered porous journal bearing. Elsharkawy (7)
analyzed the hydrodynamic lubrication of a finite flexible
porous journal bearing emphasizing on the effect of
journal misalignment.
The investigations on the size effect of structure
porosity, which strongly related to the magnitude of
porous material permeability as revealed by You and
Chang (8) were scarcely found in the literatures. As far
as the porous structure is concerned, Scheidegger (9)
conjectured that a bundle of series connected
capillaries in which the flow path may branch and later
on join together is considered to be a theoretical model
of a porous structure. Therefore, the design strategies
of feeding mechanisms for externally pressurized
journal bearings, including multiple holes, orifice, slots,
and porous materials as proposed by Cheng and Rowe
(10), can be categorized as porous structures. Straight
porous materials are generally considered to have very
small porosity associated with an extremely low
permeability at the order of 10-14~10-9 m2. Whereas,
feeding mechanisms composed of multiple holes and
slots can be considered to be porous structures having
large size porosity associated with relatively high
permeability effect. For the purpose of design
consideration with regard to feeding mechanisms, the
effects of permeability magnitudes of porous structure
on the performance of gas lubricated journal bearings
are investigated in this paper.

This study uses a finite difference numerical scheme of
second order accuracy to derive the discretization
equations of Eqs. [10] and [11]. Because strong non-
linearity is involved in the solving procedures of ijS and
ijkU , an under-relaxation factorassociated with the
Gauss-Seidel iterative method is introduced in order to
prompt the converged solutions of ijS and ijkU .
The iterative calculations are considered to have
attained their converged solutions when the relative
errors of the computed values satisfy the following
convergence criteria, i.e.,

Note that the load equations, Eqs. [5] and [6], are
integrated numerically by the Trapezoid integration rule,
and the air flow rate, Eq. [9], is integrated numerically
by Romberg’s integration method.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
For fixed geometrical design parameters of
C/R=0.001, L/D=1; H/D=0.1, this study obtains the
pressure solutions covering the ranges of Λ from 0~8 
and Λp from 0.1~10. Note that the dimensionless 
porous permeability )(CHk = 8.33x10-9 ~ 8.33x10-7 is
assumed.
The validity and convergence of the
computational scheme for the present non-linear
problems are verified and illustrated in Fig. 2. Figure 2
shows a comparison between the present work and the
load results obtained using correction method by Saha
and Majamdar (6) for the rotating case of Λ≠0.It is
found that the agreement is satisfactorily good.

Figures 3 (a) and (b) show the pressure
distributions at the bearing’s central plane, Y=0, with 
Λp=0.1 and 10, respectively. At a smal feeding 
parameter, e.g., Λp =0.1, therelatively limited feeding
air (see Fig. 4) causes a significant aerodynamic effect
near the minimum film thickness at 0180 as
shown in Figs. 3(a). In Fig. 3 (b) where Λp =10, the 
uniform pressure distributions existed in bearing
clearance are referred to as the aerostatic lubricating
efect for porous journal bearing with large Λp. Since a 
higher feeding parameter Λp is equivalent to a larger 
feeding pore for air to flow through, it is expected that
extremely high flow rates are fed circumferentially into
the bearing space (Fig. 4). Presumably, abundant
feeding-air that flows rapidly into the bearing space and
uniformly surrounds the journal results in more uniform
pressure distributions inside the bearing space.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper studies the performance of a finite length
porous journal bearings fed by externally pressurized
air. The non-linear coupled partial differential equations,
governed the bearing clearance and porous bushing,
are used to solve for the pressure solutions in the
bearing space and porous matrix. Two characteristic
parameters, i.e., the feeding parameter Λp, 
representing the structure permeability, and a
conventional bearing number Λ, representing the 
journal rotational effect, are mainly concerned in the
analysis. A quasi-linear numerical scheme associated
with an under-relaxation factor is used to solve for the
pressure solutions of the non-linear coupled PDE.
Several important results are summarized as follows:
1. For smal feeding parameter, e.g., Λp =0.1, the 
limited feeding air gives the porous bearing a
significant aerodynamic lubricating effect near
the minimum film thickness at 0180 .
Whereas, aerostatic lubricating effect is more
profound than the aerodynamic effect for a
porous journal bearing with a large Λp.
2. When the permeability parameter Λp is smal, 
the aerodynamic lubricating effect is further
promoted for porous journal bearing operating
at relatively heavy load, in which the minimum
film thickness decreases.
3. The significant increase in load capacity for
bearing operating at smal Λp number and 
heavy load conditions proves the enhanced
effects of aerodynamic lubrication. The
optimum feeding parameter Λp for maximum 
load capacity ranges from approximately 0.5 to
1.0.
4. A journal bearing operating with smal Λp 
number may encounter greater risk for the
journal shaft to touch the bearing wall than a
bearing with large Λp.
