Abstract 
The aim of this study is to develop a novel 
electrical discharge machining (EDM) system 
using gas media immersed in deionized water, 
and then used this developed EDM system to 
investigate the effects of EDM machining 
parameters on machining characteristics in 
terms of material removal rate (MRR), 
electrode wear rate (EWR), and surface 
roughness. Firstly, the experiments were 
conducted to assess the feasibility of the EDM 
system with stable machining progress. 
Moreover, the main EDM machining 
parameters such as machining polarity, peak 
current, pulse duration, and the air supply 
conditions like compressed air pressure were 
varied to evaluate effects on machining 
characteristics of SKD 61 mold steel using the 
developed EDM process. A fast digital 
oscilloscope was used to detect the discharge 
waveforms during the machining to evaluate 
the stability of gap conditions, and the surface 
morphology was observed by a scanning 
electronic microscope (SEM) to determine the 
influences of EDM discharge energy on surface 
integrities. From the experimental results 
shown, the MRR increased with peak current, 
pulse duration, and compressed air pressure. In 
addition, the EWR went up with peak current, 
and the EWR declined as further extending the 
pulse duration at larger peak current. The 
surface roughness went up with peak current, 
the machined surface revealed a coarser feature 
when the peak current was set at high value. 
 
Keywords: EDM, EDM using gas media 
immersed in deionized water, material removal 
rate, electrode wear rate.

3.2 實驗方法 
本研究係採用電晶體控制回路之雕模放
電加工機，以液中高壓氣體為加工介質進行
放電加工的實驗探討。實驗主要目的係在建
立 SKD 61 模具鋼液中穩定進行氣體放電加
工的可行性機制，並進一步探討實驗加工參
數對放電加工特性的影響。實驗中除使用乾
燥處理後之高壓空氣做為放電加工介質外，
並使用去離子水置入放電加工槽中，形成液
中氣體放電加工系統。實驗進行中將高壓氣
體以管路及壓力調整機構控制在設定的壓力
條件，經中空銅電極導引至放電加工區域，
而去離子水在放電加工實驗時，則維持在工
件表面上方 5 cm 的液體高度。放電加工過程
中藉高壓氣流的作用，驅使蒸發、熔融之材
料，迅速自極間排除，並經由去離子水維持
極間的拘束性，保持放電的穩定進行，達到
材枓去除的效果。圖一為液中氣體放電加工
實驗設備配置示意圖；圖二為液中氣體放電
加工極間高壓氣體作用示意圖。 
液中氣體放電加工特性的量測包括材料
去除率 (Material removal rate, MRR /mm3· 
min-1)、電極消耗率(Electrode wear rate, EWR 
/ mm 3 ·min-1) 及 表 面 粗 糙 度 (Surface 
roughness, Ra/μm)，加工前後均需量測工件試
片及電極的重量，以便計算材料去除率及電
極消耗率，試片重量的量測係採用(Percisa 
XT 220A)精度 0.1mg 之精密電子秤進行測
量 ， 表 面 粗 糙 度 的 量 測 係 採 用
(Mitutoyo-SJ401)精密表面輪廓粗度儀，採隨
機方式量測 5 次加工面的表面粗糙度值，並
且求其算數平均值做為表面粗糙度的評估基
準。實驗中利用高速數位式示波器偵測放電
波形的變化，藉以評估放電加工實驗過程中
極間的穩定性。同時利用光學顯微鏡(OM)及
掃描式電子顯微鏡(SEM)對加工表面進行觀
察，以瞭解放電加工表面微觀形態的變化。

3.3 實驗條件 
液中氣體放電加工實驗研究主要探討參
 3
 液中放電的條件，由圖中可知，液中放電其
材料去除率會隨著放電脈衝作用時間的延
長，而呈現下降的趨勢，明顯不同於液中氣
體放電加工的實驗結果。由於液中放電之材
料去除作用，相當倚賴加工液在放電加工過
程所誘發的爆壓衝擊力，而爆壓衝擊力僅在
放電脈衝周期初期較為明顯，然後隨脈衝時
間的增長而迅速下降[26]。因此液中進行放
電加工，延長脈衝作用時間，並不像液中氣
體放電加工，材料去除率會隨著放電脈衝時
間的增長而增加。圖七為加工極性對液中氣
體放電之材料去除率的影響。由實驗結果可
看出，將銅電極接到電源陽極而SKD61工件
材料接到電源陰極的正極性加工(+)，可得到
較高的材料去除率。一般而言，在較長脈衝
時間的加工條件下，陰極將承受較多的放電
能量[27]，引發較明顯的蒸發、熔融等材料
去除作用，因此有較為明顯的材料去除效果。

4.3 液中氣體放電加工對電極消耗率的分析 
圖八為液中氣體放電加工在不同放電電
流下電極消耗率之比較。由圖中實驗結果可
知，液中氣體放電加工之電極消耗率會隨著
放電峰值電流之增加而提高，在較大電流的
加工條件下，電極消耗率隨著放電脈衝時間
的延長而有下降的現象。一般而言，電極消
耗率大都與材料移除率呈現同向變化情況，
也就是材料移除率(或放電能量)增加，則電
極消耗率亦隨之同步增加，反之亦然。但當
放電脈衝時間設定在較長的加工條件時，電
極消耗率會呈現些微降低的現象。圖九為液
中氣體放電加工在不同氣體壓力下電極消耗
率之比較，由實驗的結果顯示，液中氣體放
電加工之電極消耗率受氣體壓力的影響並不
明顯。但在液中放電加工時(氣體壓力設為0
時)，則由於受液體放電時極間誘發之爆壓衝
擊力的作用，電極消耗率明顯高於液中氣體
放電加工之電極消耗率。圖十為液中氣體放
電加工極性對電極消耗率的影響，由實驗的
結果顯示，銅電極接電源陽極而SKD61工件
接陰極的正極性(+)比電極接法對調之負極
性(-)加工有較大的電極消耗率，且負極性加
工時，電極消耗率非常低，甚至有電極消耗
率呈現負值的情形。負的電極消耗率代表著
電極的重量在加工過程中不減反增的現象，
顯示放電過程中有部份的工件材料會轉移附
著於電極，此現象可能會造成後續加工精度
的不確定因素，為消除此種顧慮並以材料移
除率為考量重點，爾後之實驗均採用工具電
極接陽極的正極性加工為主。

 圖十四為極間供給不同氣體進行液中氣
體放電加工之材料去除率的比較，如圖所
示，液中氣體放電加工極間供給氧氣時可得
到最佳的材料去除效果，其次為壓縮空氣，
而使用氮氣則獲得最小的材料去除率。由於
極間導入高壓氧氣，除了藉助氧氣沖除熔融
材料達到材料的去除效果外，氧氣的輸入有
明顯的助燃效果，可促進極間放電時的熱作
用，引發更為明顯的材料熔融效果，因而得
較佳的材料去除率。而使用氮氣則由於放電
極間將形成保護氣氛，因而使得氧化作用受
到抑制，降低了極間材料的熔融作用而減低
了材料的去除率。圖十五則為液中氣體放電
加工在不同氣體供給條件下表面粗糙度之比
較，如實驗結果顯示，液中氣體放電加工極
間供給氮氣可得到最平整細緻的加工表面，
而使用氧氣為加工的氣體介質時，則由於有
很明顯的氧化作用發生，提升了材枓的去除
效果，因而在加工表面造成最大的表面粗糙
度。 
五、結論 
本研究以實驗方法探討液中氣體放電加
工參數對SKD61模具鋼加工特性的影響，經
實驗結果的分析探討，可獲得以下幾點結論： 
1. 液中氣體放電可維持極間較穩定的放電現
象，獲得較氣中放電精緻平整的加工表面。 
2. 液中氣體放電加工之材料移除率會隨著放
電峰值電流與放電脈衝時間之增加而提
高；同時材料去除率也會隨著氣體壓力的
增加而呈現增加的趨勢。當氣體壓力設為
0 之液中放電加工，其材料去除率會隨著
放電脈衝作用時間的延長，而呈現下降的
趨勢，明顯不同於液中氣體放電加工的實
驗結果。再者，將銅電極接到電源陽極
SKD61 工件材料接到電源陰極的正極性
加工(+)，液中氣體放電加工可得到較高的
材料去除率。 
3. 液中氣體放電加工之電極消耗率會隨著放
電峰值電流之增加而提高，在較大電流的
加工條件下，電極消耗率隨著放電脈衝時
間的延長而有下降的現象，但在液中放電
加工時，電極消耗率明顯高於液中氣體放
電加工之電極消耗率。電極消耗率受氣體
壓力的影響，由實驗結果顯示並不明顯；
銅電極接電源陽極而 SKD61 工件接陰極
的正極性加工比負極性加工有較大的電極
消耗率，且負極性加工時，電極消耗率非
常低，甚至有時電極消耗率會呈現負值的
情形。

第四天(11月5日) 大會仍安排有三個場次的Keynote speaker，主題分別為先進材料技術、 
先進表面技術、複合材料技術，選擇參加由Northumbria University ( UK)Sarwar教授發表題目- 
Development of advanced surface engineering technologies for the benefit of multipoint cutting 
tools的專題演講，主要的內容在講述表面技術對切削刀具性能的影響，尤其對於高速切削、
乾式切削、精密成形加工及難加工材料的削加工，經由被覆技術的發展大幅提升刀具的加工

ABSTRACT
This study investigates the feasibility of EDM for processing ZrO2 and Al2O3 of non-
conductive ceramics, which were covered an assisted conductive material named adherent
copper foil on workpiece surface. The conductive material adhered on the surface of the non-
conductive ceramics would induce a series of electrical discharges between tool electrode and
workpiece in the initial stage of EDM process. Thus, the pyrolytic carbon that cracked from
kerosene was formed and deposited on the machined surface to maintain the progress of EDM.
In this work, the essential EDM machining parameters were varied to determine the effects on
material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear rate (EWR), and surface roughness. A fast digital
oscilloscope was used to inspect the discharge waveforms and to evaluate the stability of EDM
progress. Moreover, the machined surface was assessed by scanning electron microscope (SEM)
to explore the surface integrities of ZrO2 and Al2O3 machined by EDM. The aim of this study
intended to establish the feasibility and develop an applicable process for processing non-
conductive ceramics through EDM. Moreover, the exploitation of this work can be applied to the
industrial applications and used to develop the machining technique for non-conductive ceramics.

1. INTRODUCTION
Ceramics are widely employed in modern industrial applications such as machining tools,
moulds and dies, vehicles systems, electronic devices, and semiconductor systems. The versatile
features and sophisticated characteristics of ceramics attribute to its excellent physical and
mechanical properties. Although ceramics with high strength, hardness, dielectric, and corrosion
resistance could promote their performance in various applications, it also exhibits the vigorous
challenges in shaping stage using traditional machining process. The machining cost is inevitably
increased in machining ceramic materials. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is one of non-
conventional machining processes, which removes surplus materials by means of consecutive
sparks (discharge columns) generating between tool electrode and workpiece. Both tool
electrode and workpiece material are immersed in a dielectric fluid such as kerosene and
deionized water. The extremely elevated temperature is produced by deionization within the
discharge column as the electrical energy is supplied into machining gap during EDM process.
The little amount of workpiece material and tool electrode on localized area is vaporized and
melted due to the high temperature. Then the impulsive force is developed by dielectric fluid
exploding, and the melted materials are ejected from the machined surface due to the impulsive
outstanding elevated temperature strength. The electrode material selected electrolytic copper in
this investigation. The dimensions of workpiece and electrode were 12 mm×12 mm×5 mm and
30 mm×20 mm×1.5 mm, respectively. Thus, a machined area of 1.5 mm×5 mm would be formed
on the machined surface in each experiment. The essential properties of workpiece and electrode
are listed in Tables 1 and 2. The end face of electrode against the workpiece was ground on a
plate using the emery paper in the sequence of mesh 600#, 800#, and 1200# to guarantee the
surface finishing and the flatness of each electrode at the same level. The workpiece materials
were non-conductive ceramics, so the machined surface of ceramics should be covered an
assisted electrical conductive material to induce the electrical discharge columns between the
tool electrode and workpiece at the initial stage of EDM progress. Consequently, the pyrolytic
carbon that cracked from kerosene was generated and deposited on the machined surface of non-
conductive ceramics to retain the progress of EDM. Moreover, the tool electrode composition
would migrate to machined surface during EDM process [31,32], so the migrated tool electrode
composition could enhance the conductive layer to be constructed on workpiece surface and to
attain the threshold of electrical conductivity for EDM process. For the purpose to reduce the
operation complexity, the assisted electrical material in this work was employed an adherent
copper foil whose specifications and properties were listed in Table 3. The adherent copper foil
could firmly adhered on the non-conductive ceramics without any additional operations, the
crucial constraint pertain to conductivity for EDM process was constructed on non-conductive
ceramic materials.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Effects of Adherent Copper Foil on Discharge Waveforms
Figure 2 shows the discharge waveforms of ZrO2 obtained by adherent copper foil under a
smaller (Ip: 2A, p: 200 s) and a larger (Ip: 6A, p: 200 s) discharge energy levels. From this
figure shows, at a smaller discharge energy level (Ip: 2A, p: 200 s) the discharge waveforms
usually revealed normal pulse trains during 1~60 sec of machining elapsed time (Fig.2-(a)). The
discharge waveforms illustrated normal pulse trains because the electrical discharge column was
formed between electrode and adherent copper foil covered on ZrO2 ceramic at the initial stage.
While the machining elapsed time prolonged to 20~25 min, the electrode would penetrate into
the base material of workpiece. The electrical discharge column was then generated between the
electrode and ZrO2 ceramic. The discharge waveforms at this stage (machining elapsed time
20~25 min) also revealed well normal pulse trains (Fig.2-(b)). It can be verified from observing
the electrical discharge waveforms that the action of electrical discharge was continually
generated between tool and workpiece for machining ZrO2 ceramic. Moreover, this figure also
shows that at a higher discharge energy level (Ip: 6A,p: 200 s) the discharge waveforms were
regular during 1~60 sec of machining elapsed time (Fig.2-(c)). While the machining time
extended to 20~25 min, the discharge waveforms also illustrated normal pulse trains (Fig.2-(d)).
Therefore, the EDM progress could be maintained at such discharge energy level (Ip: 6A,p: 200
s) for machining ZrO2 ceramic using adherent copper foil covered on workpiece. Figure 3
shows the discharge waveforms of Al2O3 obtained by adherent copper foil under a smaller (Ip:
2A,p: 200s) and a larger (Ip: 6A,p: 200s) discharge energy levels. As shown in this figure,
the discharge waveforms of Al2O3 displayed normal pulse trains not only under a smaller
discharge energy level (Ip: 2A, p: 200 s) at initial stage (1~60 sec) but also under a larger
discharge energy (Ip: 6A, p: 200 s) at prolonged machining time (20~25 min). The electrical
discharge column was steady generated within the machining gap between tool electrode and
Al2O3 ceramic to demonstrate the normal discharge waveforms.
The consecutive normal discharge waveforms confirmed that the action of electrical
discharge could be formed at the initial stage between the tool electrode and adherent copper foil
on the ZrO2 and Al2O3 ceramics, and then the adequate pyrolytic carbon was cracked from
kerosene and deposited on the workpiece surface to form a suitable electrical conductivity. As a
result, the workpiece surface of ZrO2 and Al2O3 ceramics transferred into the electrical
conductive feature to implement the EDM process. The progress of electrical discharge columns
could be steadily and constantly generated in the machining gap during machining ZrO2 and
Al2O3 ceramics.
Figure 4 shows discharge waveforms of ZrO2 and Al2O3 with adherent copper foil covered
on the workpiece surface under equivalent discharge energy (Ip: 6A,p: 400s) obtained during
1~60 sec and 20~25 min of machining elapsed time, respectively. As shown in this figure, the
discharge waveforms revealed well normal at the initial stage (1~60 sec).While the machining
elapsed time extended to 20~25 min, the discharge waveforms obtained from ZrO2 exhibited
normal pulse trains as well as. By contrast, the discharge waveforms obtained from Al2O3 started
to become unstable and demonstrate a few of abnormal discharge waveforms such as arcing in
this interval (20~25 min). The electrical discharge easily concentrated on a localized area, as the
machining elapsed time was extended and the pulse duration was set to a longer machining
condition. It can be attributed to that the intensive machining debris and pyrolytic carbon were
generated within the machining gap due to larger electrical discharge energy. When the
machining debris either expelled incompletely or distributed un-uniformly in the machining gap,
Figure 5 shows MRR of ZrO2 ceramic under various peak currents and pulse durations
using adherent copper foil covered on workpiece surface in EDM process. From the
experimental results show, the MRR of ZrO2 increased with the increase in peak current and
pulse duration. The discharge energy delivered into machining zone would be enlarged when the
peak current and pulse duration increased, so the effects of melting, vaporizing, and dielectric
exploding to remove the surplus materials were enhanced in EDM process. Furthermore, since
the ceramics have inherent material properties such as low thermal conductivity, high hardness,
and high brightness as well as, the action of thermal spalling would be formed on the machined
surface of ceramics materials due to the localization of elevated and steep gradient temperature
during EDM process. The MRR of ceramic material was promoted, since the effect of thermal
spalling was enhanced at larger discharge energy. Consequently, the MRR of ZrO2 ceramic
increased with peak current and pulse duration.
Figure 6 shows the MRR of Al2O3 ceramic under various peak currents and pulse durations
using adherent copper foil covered on workpiece surface in EDM process. From the
experimental results show that the trend of MRR was same as that obtain from ZrO2 ceramic.
Moreover, the values of MRR obtained from Al2O3 were distinct less than that from ZrO2 under
equivalent EDM conditions. Since the EDM is a thermal erosion process, the workpiece material
properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and melting point are the
prominent factors that affected the material removed efficiency in EDM process. The essential
properties of Al2O3 ceramic exhibit higher thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and as
well as lower melting point compared with ZrO2 ceramic. From comprehensively compared the
essential material properties of ZrO2 with Al2O3 ceramics, the Al2O3 ceramic was a more
difficult-to-machine using EDM process. It was difficult to receive a higher material removed
effects caused by material melting and vaporization. Thus, the MRR obtained from Al2O3 was
less than that from ZrO2 under equivalent EDM condition.

3.2.2 Electrode Wear Rate
Figure 7 shows the EWR of machining ZrO2 ceramic under various peak currents and pulse
durations using adherent copper foil covered on workpiece surface in EDM process. Generally,
the surplus workpiece materials were removed by the spark formed between the tool electrode
and workpiece, and as well as the electrode material was also eroded by the extremely high
temperature caused by the spark action during EDM process. As mentioned above, when the
peak current and pulse duration increased in the EDM process, the electrical discharge energy
delivered into the machining zone was increased. The amount of workpiece materials removed
within single pulse was increased at larger peak current, so the EWR became more obviously at
larger peak current during EDM process. However, as the pulse duration extended, the electrical
more difficult to machine using EDM process. Therefore, the discharge craters became deeper
and wider as the discharge energy was increased; the surface roughness became coarser as
increased the peak current and pulse duration. Moreover, the surface roughness of Al2O3 ceramic
obtained from EDM was coarser than that obtain from ZrO2 at identical machining condition.

cracks were more obvious and the surface integrities became rougher as the discharge energy
was increased. Moreover, the ZrO2 revealed more globules of debris adhered to machined
surface, and the Al2O3 machined surface displayed rougher as well as thermal spalling features.

ABSTRACT 
 
The debris re-adhering on the machining surface will affect the workpiece precision in EDM; 
therefore, the main purpose of this research is to study the re-sticky phenomenon of the powder 
metallurgy (PMM) in EDM. PMM with different melting points from 1450oC to 3410oC were 
used as EDM materials, the copper and the tungsten were chosen as the electrodes. The polarity 
in EDM was depended on the pole of the electrode. For observing the re-sticky position of the 
debris, the electrode was set no rotation or with 200 rpm rotational speed in EDM. The results 
showed that the melting point of PMM did not exceed 3000oC (PMM did not contain tungsten); 
the debris of PMM would not re-stick on the working surface no matter what polarity was used 
in EDM. However, only negative polarity can cause the re-adhesive effect when the melting 
point of PMM exceeded 3000oC. The debris would re-stick on any machining position when the 
electrode was not rotated in EDM. However, the debris would adhere on the central of the 
working area with 200 rpm rotational speed of the electrode.

1. INTRODUCTION 
PMM is widely applied in the industry because of its excellent properties, such as high 
hardness, high toughness and high strength. Due to these excellent properties, PMM is hard to 
process by the traditional cutting. EDM is a non-traditional method that uses the heat erosion 
effect to melt and vaporize the material from the workpiece. Therefore, only if the materials with 
electric conduction, they all can be manufactured by EDM no matter the mechanical properties 
of these materials, so it is appropriate using EDM to finish the PMM. Part of researches about 
table 1. Moreover, materials of the cylindrical electrode were also assisted to find the re-sticky 
phenomenon, so copper with the high thermal conductivity and tungsten with the high melting 
point was selected as the electrodes in EDM. Diameters of these two electrodes were 2.5 mm.

2.3 Process 
There were three steps to discuss the re-sticky effect of PMM in EDM. First step was change 
the polarity of the electrode to study why the debris would re-stick on the working surface. Then 
the position of the re-sticky debris would be found with using the rotating or stationary electrode 
in EDM. The last step would be observed the re-sticky effect in the different kinds of PMM. 
Table 2 is the working parameters using in EDM. In all the steps, MRR and micrograph of the 
re-sticky area were two main results that used to investigate the re-sticky phenomenon of PMM.

3.3 Powder metallurgy materials (PMM) 
In this section, other PMM would be applied to study the re-sticky effect in EDM again. 
Other PMM used in EDM were the tungsten, the tungsten copper, the tantalum, the molybdenum 
and the iron-cobalt-nickel alloy. Fig. 5 illustrates the effects of the polarities of different PMM 
on MRR. The results demonstrated that the positive polarity could produce better MRR than the 
negative polarity in EDM when the melting points of PMM were below 3000oC (PMM did not 
contain tungsten). Since the iron-cobalt-nickel alloy had low melting point and low thermal 
conductivity, so MRR was much higher than the molybdenum and the tantalum in positive 
polarity. However, machining process was very unstable in the negative polarity when the iron-
cobalt-nickel alloy was utilized as material; therefore, MRR of the iron-cobalt-nickel alloy was 
lower than the other two PMM. Fig. 6 shows the machining surface of PMM that the melting 
points under 3000oC. There had not any re-sticky debris on these surfaces no matter what kinds 
of polarities were used. These results presented that the re-sticky phenomena were impossible 
happening in EDM when the melting points of PMM were below 3000oC. The reason was that 
the finished debris would be easily taken away from the working area when the melting points 
were under 3000oC in EDM. 
Moreover, Fig. 5 also shows that the negative polarity would create more superior MRR than 
the positive polarity with utilizing the melting points of PMM were over 3000oC. This is because 
the ionized machining (positive polarity) could not produce high MRR in EDM with the melting 
points of PMM exceeding 3000oC. Besides, because of the low melting point and low thermal 
conductivity, the tungsten carbide had higher MRR than the other tungsten alloys in EDM. The 
machining shape of the PMM with melting points over 3000oC is presented in Fig. 7. This Fig. 
revealed that no debris re-sticks on the working surfaces when the positive polarity was applied 
as the electrode in EDM. This was because the ionized flow machining of the positive polarity 
(a) Machined surface of the iron-
cobalt-nickel with the positive

Electrode polarity would decide the re-sticky effect when the melting points of PMM 
exceeding 3000oC were used as workpiece in EDM. In this study, no matter what kinds of PMM 
were utilized, the working surface could not find any re-sticky regions after finishing when the 
electrode was connected to the positive polarity. Because of the high melting point of the 
tungsten element and high MRR in the negative polarity machining, the debris would easily re-
stick on the working surface in EDM. Moreover, cobalt including in the tungsten carbide was 
easily vaporized or melted than the tungsten and carbon, it could make large amount of the 
tungsten carbide powders to separate from the workpiece in EDM. And then part of these 
powders between the electrode and the workpiece would re-stick on the surface again. That was 
why the tungsten carbide could create the remarkable re-sticky effect than the other PMM with 
tungsten. 
The re-sticky position of the debris was randomly happen on the working surface when the 
electrode was not rotated in EDM. However, the re-sticky position of the debris would take place 
on the center of the working surface if the electrode had the rotational speed with 200 rpm. 
Moreover, the end surface of the electrode would produce a hole wear when the electrode was 
rotated in EDM. However, copper electrode had better thermal properties than the tungsten 
electrode, so the depth (near 250 μm) of the hole wear in the tungsten electrode was larger than 
the depth (about 150 μm) of the hole wear in the cupper electrode. 
In this study, the positive polarity of the electrode could make good MRR in EDM when the 
melting points of PMM were not exceeding 3000oC. Nevertheless, the negative polarity of the 
electrode could create better MRR than the positive polarity of the electrode in EDM when PMM 
contained the tungsten element.
