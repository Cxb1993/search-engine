 2
switching scheme was introduced by Sun 
and Neuvo [26], where the final output 
switches between the median filter and the 
identity filter (where no filtering happens). 
The signal-dependent rank-order-mean 
(SD-ROM) filter applies the rank-ordered 
difference as the state variable and 
excludes the current pixel itself from the 
median filter, which makes it more 
effective than uniformly applied methods 
[1]. An extension of the vector median 
filter (VMF) has been presented in both 
the adaptive sigma vector median filter 
(ASVMF) [21] and the fast peer group 
filter (FPGF) [25], where there is an 
adaptively switching filtering design. 
Their approaches depend respectively on 
the statistical measure of the vector’s 
deviation and the peer group concept to 
set up a proper threshold of detection for 
impulsive noise suppression in gray-scale 
and color images. Besides, adaptive 
versions of the LUM (low-upper-middle) 
based filtering method have also been 
proposed in [11, 19, 22]. Switching 
median filters can be viewed as adaptive 
two-level LUM smoothers providing the 
maximum and the minimum amounts of 
smoothing. These switching-based median 
filters yield satisfactory results when the 
parameters concerned are properly set. 
However, the parameters are obtained at a 
pre-assumed noise density level, and 
hence the impulse detection rule cannot 
seem to adapt to noise density variations 
[15]. 
Recently, instead of applying the 
‘detect and replace’ methodology that is 
the backbone of switching-based median 
filters, Lin proposed an adaptive center 
weighted median (ACWM) filter with an 
adjustable central weight based on the 
partition of the observation vector space 
[15]. The weight controller can also be 
regarded as a switching median filter 
scheme with satisfactory results obtained. 
However, since the ACWM filter depends 
on a learning algorithm realized by 
training over a reference image for the 
adaptive weight [13], the generalization 
capability may be weak.  
 In this project, we propose a novel 
two-pass switching rank-ordered 
arithmetic mean (TSRAM) filter that 
avoids the drawbacks of the 
aforementioned switching-based median 
filters. The new filter mechanism is 
composed of an efficient impulse detector 
based on the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) 
evidence theory and a rank-ordered 
arithmetic mean filter that works by 
estimating the noise-free ordered mean 
values excluding the current pixel itself. 
In addition, to improve the filtering 
performance of the TSRAM filter, a 
second pass filtering is performed by a 
simple switching median filter. Basically, 
the proposed filter follows the idea of the 
thresholding noise-free ordered mean 
(TNOM) filter proposed by Lin and Yu 
[18]. Although Dempster’s combination 
rule is applied in the TNOM filter, 
combination might yield illogical results 
when the collected bodies of evidence 
highly conflict with each other. That is, it 
suffers from the counter-intuitive behavior 
that was found by Zadeh [29]. In this 
work, a modified combination rule of the 
D-S evidence theory is applied instead to 
the impulse detector. With this new 
two-pass switching scheme design, the 
proposed TSRAM filter performs 
significantly better than many 
state-of-the-art switching-based median 
filters in terms of both noise suppression 
and detail preservation.  
 
二、修正 Dempster＇s 證據組合規則： 
 
Following Dempster’s combination 
rule, we can find that there may exist 
conflicting masses even though the bodies 
of evidence are consistent. That is, the K  
value exists in evidence combination. To 
overcome the problem of becoming 
counter-intuitive, Murphy and Chen et al. 
have respectively proposed some other 
combination rules [10, 23] that have really 
got somewhere. Inspired by these great 
works, our modified approach works by 
 4
impulse detector as either noisy or 
undisturbed. Then, according to the results 
the D-S impulse detector gives, the first 
pass filtering applies either the RAM filter 
to remove impulsive noise or ‘no filtering’ 
to preserve true pixels. Notably, the RAM 
filter works on the pixels in the filtering 
window detected to be not affected by 
noise. The first RAM filter can remove 
most of the noise, but the lesser impulse 
might remain. In order to alleviate this 
problem, a simple switching recursive 
rank-ordered arithmetic mean (RRAM) 
filter is employed to remove the residue 
noisy pixels that are misses, false alarms 
or over-correcting errors by the D-S 
impulse detector. Notably, the outputs of 
the recursive RAM filter are the estimates 
the current pixel makes on the basis of the 
past filter outputs. 
3.2. D-S impulse detector  
The aim of the impulse detector in a 
switching-based median filter is to decide 
as correctly as possible whether an 
impulse exists. The Dempster-Shafer 
evidence theory (DSET) can provide a 
method to process imprecision and 
uncertainty [3, 4]. Switching noise 
detection schemes based on DSET are 
developed to classify each pixel to be 
either noisy or undisturbed. To apply the 
DSET to the impulse detector in Fig. 3, 
the frame of discernment includes two 
elements: corrupted pixel ( C ) and 
undisturbed good pixel ( G ). Thus, the 
power set contains four elements: 
UGC ,, (universe GC ∪ ), and empty set 
(φ ) [18]. In this work, the D-S impulse 
detector makes its decision on the basis of 
three bodies of evidences ),(ks )(kz and 
)(ke (which will be introduced in the next 
subsection), and evidence fusion by the 
modified Dempster’s combination rule in 
(6).  
3.2.1 Evidence extraction and mass 
function definition 
In general, the values of most pixels 
affected by impulsive noise are 
dramatically different from those of their 
neighbors in comparison with the fine 
changes of signals. Therefore, the 
difference between the current pixel )(kx  
and the median of the filter window }{kw  
provides an efficient piece of information 
to help identify a noisy pixel [15, 16, 18].  
Definition 2: The variable )(ks  denotes 
the absolute difference between the input 
)(kx  and the median value )(kM  as 
follows: 
.)()()( kMkxks −=            (8) 
Note that )(ks  is evidence for detecting 
the probability of the input )(kx being 
contaminated. Now, )(ks  can be 
represented by the mass function 
).()( Cm ks  A large )()( Cm ks  value 
indicates that the input )(kx  is dissimilar 
to the median value of the filter window 
}{kw ; that is, the evidence suggests that 
the central pixel )(kx is probably 
corrupted by impulsive noise.  
The hypotheses to be considered in 
D-S formulation are: ,φ  singleton 
hypotheses C  and G , and compound 
hypothesis .U  In the D-S evidence 
theory, mass functions are subject to the 
following constraints: 
0)()( =φksm , 
1)()()( )()()( =++ UmGmCm ksksks . 
U  is the set for signals that fail to be 
allocated as either noisy or undisturbed. 
When the evidence is not solid enough to 
put the case in either C  or ,G  it seems 
reasonable to give a non-null mass to their 
compound hypothesis .U  For the D-S 
detector, the ways to determine the mass 
functions of G and U  are as follows: 
)),(1(3/2)( )()( CmGm ksks −=        (9) 
)).(1(3/1)( )()( CmUm ksks −=        (10) 
Notably, the parameters 3/2  in (9) and 
3/1  in (10) are predefined by extensive 
empirical testing.

3.2.3. Detection rule of the D-S impulse 
detector 
The main issue about switching 
scheme-based filters lies in building a 
decision rule that can distinguish the 
undisturbed good pixels from noisy ones 
as precisely as possible. To develop a 
decision process, the detection rule of the 
D-S impulse detector that corresponds to 
the singleton hypotheses can be achieved 
by combining the final belief values of C  
(for corrupted pixels) and G  (for 
undisturbed good pixels). When )(Cm  
exceeds ),(Gm  the input pixel )(kx  
can be seen as a noisy pixel. That is, the 
D-S impulse detector of the TSRAM filter 
determines whether the input )(kx  is a 
noisy pixel or an undisturbed good pixel 
by following the belief decision rule 
below.

3.3. Two-pass switching-scheme noise 
filtering 
The binary noise flag map ),( jiF  
of the D-S impulse detector serves as an 
indicator showing whether the pixel )(kx  
is corrupted by impulsive noise or is 
undisturbed. If the input pixel is classified 
as impulsive noise according to the 
),( jiF , then the noisy pixel is replaced 
by the output of the rank-ordered 
arithmetic mean (RAM) filter. Otherwise, 
the input pixel is left unchanged (identity 
operation). Notably, the mean value given 
by the arithmetic mean (AM) filter is 
derived from only the noise-free pixels 
within the filter window }{kw . However, 
unlike that in the AM filter, the mean 
value in the RAM filter here is a 
rank-ordered mean evaluated as

The first RAM filter can remove 
most of the noise, but it might misclassify 
pixels when there is severe noise density 
interference. That is, the lesser impulse 
might remain. In order to alleviate this 
problem and improve the filtering 
performance, a simple switching recursive 
rank-ordered arithmetic mean (RRAM) 
filter is also used to remove the residue 
nosy pixels that are misses, false alarms or 
over-correcting errors by the D-S impulse 
detector. Notably, the output of the RRAM 
filter is the estimate of the current pixel 
made on the basis of the past filter outputs. 
Figure 3 shows the structure of the second 
pass filtering mechanism that is applied to 
process each pixel. The second pass filter 
detects noisy pixels by checking the 
difference between the output )(' ky  of 
the first pass filter and the median value of 
the current filter window }{' kw as Fig. 2 
shows. Then, the second pass filter 
employs the threshold T  to determine 
 8
The third experiment was to 
demonstrate the robustness of the TSRAM 
filter. Figures 6 and 7 show the MSE and 
MAE comparisons respectively with the 
restored image ‘Boat’ corrupted by 
various percentages of impulsive noises. 
Figures. 6 and 7 reveal that the TSRAM 
filter has exhibited a satisfactory 
performance in robustness.  
 
五、討論與結論： 
 
In this project, the computation cost 
issue also deserves discussion. In the 
experiments, the algorithms were 
implemented in JAVA language and run 
on a Dual-Core 1.83 GHz PC. Table 2 
shows that the TSRAM filter required 
more CPU time than the other 
switching-based filters for filtering the test 
image ‘Lena’ sized 512512×  corrupted 
by fixed-valued impulsive noise at 
%20=p . Because of the additional 
one-pass filtering, the computation time 
the TSRAM filter spends is longer than 
that needed by some other filters. 
However, in spite of the extra computation 
load, the proposed TSRAM filter can 
indeed outperform the other switching 
-based filters in terms of both noise 
suppression and detail preservation. 
Nevertheless, as Table 2 reveals, the new 
TSRAM filter needs less computation 
time than the state-of-the-art ACWM and 
TNOM filters. 
In this project, a new two-pass 
switching rank-ordered arithmetic mean 
filter has been proposed to improve the 
performance of switching-based median 
filters, preserving more image details 
while effectively suppressing impulsive 
noise. To put the TSRAM filter together, a 
modified Dempster’s combination rule is 
added to the proposed D-S impulse 
detector. In addition, to improve the 
filtering performance, a second pass 
filtering is performed by using a simple 
switching median filter. With this new 
two-pass switching scheme, the proposed 
TSRAM filter performs significantly 
better than the state-of-the-art 
switching-based median filters in terms of 
both noise suppression and detail 
preservation.
