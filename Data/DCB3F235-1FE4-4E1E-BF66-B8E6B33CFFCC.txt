Lactic Acid Fermentation by Cultures of Rhizopus arrhizus and 
Rhizopus oryzae Using Ammonia as Neutralizing Agent 
 
Abstract 
L-lactic acid fermentation with Rhizopus arrhizus BCRC 33071 or R. oryzae ATCC 
9363 was carried out in an air-lift bioreactor. During fermentation a neutralizing agent 
composed of 1% urea, 2% ammonium bicarbonate and 10% ammonia was fed into the culture 
broth by means of diffusion. The fermentation was carried at 35ºC, 1 vvm (superficial 
velocity = 0.74 cm/s) with a working volume of 3.5 L. When 120g/L of glucose was used as 
substrate, maximum lactic acid concentration, productivity and yield (100%× the mass ratio 
of lactic acid produced to glucose consumed) resulted from fermentation with R. arrhizus 
were 102 g/L, 3.00 g/L•h and 85%, respectively, whereas that from R. oryzae were only 92 
g/L, 2.88 g/L•h and 77%, respectively. 
 
Introduction 
 
L-Lactic aid is an important raw material to produce biodegradable and biocompatible 
polymers, such as poly-L-lactic acid. Synthetic lactic acid made from petrochemical 
feed-stocks is a racemic mixture, which is optically inactive. Industrial production of lactic 
acid, pure in L-form, relies predominately on fungal strains such as Rhizopus species (1). 
Although Lactobacillus debruckii and other metabolically engineered bacteria or yeast can 
produce L-lactic acid too (2-5), the culture medium ingredients, such as yeast extract and 
peptone for these strains and the downstream steps, such as microfiltration or centrifugation to 
clarify the culture broth are costly. Traditionally, L-lactic acid is produced through the 
fermentation of glucose or starch with Rhizopus sp. During fermentation calcium carbonate 
 4
agent (13, 14). In the present work, lactic acid fermentation with R. arrhizus or R. oryzae was 
carried out in an air-lift bioreactor, using ammonia solution as neutralizing agent. Both 
ammonium bicarbonate and urea were mixed with ammonia water to provide a buffer effect. 
Urea was hydrolyzed by the catalysis of urease on the mycelium (15), wherein the products 
NH3 and CO2 have similar buffer effect as ammonium bicarbonate. Furthermore, gaseous CO2 
could make mycelial pellets becoming porous-like. This morphology of mycelium is 
beneficial for the mass transfer of nutrients, substrates and product in the culture broth and 
thus enhances the production of lactic acid. In this work, ammonia solution was not fed 
directly to the fermentation broth (figure 2A). Instead, a porous glass device (figure 2B) was 
connected to the end of the tube and ammonia diffused into the culture broth. Most 
ammonium hydroxide would be neutralized with lactic acid before contacting with mycelium. 
In this way, the damage of ammonia on fungal cells is expected to be minimized. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Microorganisms and culture media 
R. arrhizus BCRC 33071 and R. oryzae ATCC 9363 were obtained from Bioresource 
Collection and Research Center (BCRC), Taiwan. The originally freeze-dried skim 
milk-containing culture was aseptically ground into powders. Each fermentation process was 
always started with few culture powders being inoculated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), 
where spores were produced. The medium for the seed culture were composed of the 
following ingredients in grams per liter: glucose 50, ammonium sulfate 3, KH2PO4 0.5, 
MgSO4•7H2O 0.5, ZnSO4•7H2O, 0.04 and CaCO3 10. In order to obtain a shake flask culture 
exhibiting pellet-like morphology, CaCO3 was added to the culture after 8 h of cultivation 
(Bai et al., 2003). The medium for lactic acid production consisted of the following 
ingredients (g/L): glucose 120, ammonium sulfate 1, KH2PO4 0.5, MgSO4•7H2O 0.5 and 
 6
nm. The mobile phase was 0.1% at 0.4 mL/min. The retention time for lactic acid was 21 min. 
L -lactic acid purchased from Fluka was used as the authentic standard. Glucose was assayed 
by YSI model 2700 glucose analyzer. 
 
Results and discussion 
 
Effect of different neutralizing agent on lactic acid fermentation 
When lactic acid fermentation with R. arrhizus BCRC 33071 was performed at pH 
around 5.2 using ammonia, AC-ammonia, AU-ammonia or ACU-ammonia as neutralizing 
agent, time courses of fermentation were shown in figures 4(A)-(D), respectively. The final 
concentrations, productivities and yields of lactic acid, and biomass were compared in table 1. 
That compare to ammonia water addition of ammonia bicarbonate to ammonia water 
enhanced lactic acid production manifests damage of cell is decreased by the buffer effect of 
bicarbonate ion. Addition of urea to ammonia water increase lactic acid production too. 
However, optimum lactic acid production was obtained when both ammonium bicarbonate 
and urea were added to ammonia water suggests that they combine have synergistic effect. It 
implies that the mechanism of urea effect is different from that of ammonium bicarbonate. 
Figure 5(A)-(D) show the mycelial morphology of R. arrhizus after 36 h of fermentation 
using (A) ammonia, (B) AC-ammonia, (C) AU-ammonia, and (D) ACU-ammonia as 
neutralizing agent. Compared to the mycelial morphology using other neutralizing agents, 
ACU-ammonia leads to more uniformed and smaller mycelial pellets. This might be because 
in addition to the buffer effect of bicarbonate ion, urea yields NH3 and gaseous CO2 through 
the catalysis of fungal urease, CO2 gas making mycelia more dispersed. This is beneficial for 
the mass transfer of fungal culture. Lactic acid fermentation is optimized due to the overall 
effect of buffering and gas-producing.
